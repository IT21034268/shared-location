1,cute but not functional,this was a cute gift but my son always looked uncomfortable so I didnt use it much.
2,"Features great harp, poor gestalt","I have been blowing blues harp for 35 years. I have a substantial CD collection. There is some good harmonica playing on these tracks. However, it is not tasteful. Harmonica is played most powerfully in certain areas of a song. You wait for it, and when it comes there is a sense of satisfaction. There is too much harp playing going on. It feels like, they are trying to impress. It sounds like they were largely unrehearsed. An overall sense of tightness is lacking."
3,Dry as Arizona soil...,"Having read several books on local foods and sustainability, I really wanted to love this book. I wanted to read about this man's year of eating local in the southwest US. However, I found the book just about as dry as the soil in the Arizona, where the book takes place... his writing style did not engage me. It did not make me want to continue turning the pages. Perhaps it is because I readAnimal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life (P.S.)right before this? It had great potential... but it left me disappointed."
2,"An important topic, but immensley boring","The author has some very important things to say, most of which I agree with. I learned some things that made me curious and excited. I learned some things that made me wince with fear and disgust. Not bad.Unfortunately, most of the book is full of semi-narcissistic, pseudo-spiritual drivel that makes for a long and painful read. I wish that Nabhan had teemed up with Mark Kurlansky to write it."
4,Good,Way better than the oval lemmon one - try it and see. Nice design on the front as well and good color.
1,bestop is garbage,This thing is total garbage. It doesnt fit the way it is supposed to. At first I thought I wasnt reading the instructions correctly...then I drove my car over to my friends dads house who has owned an autobody shop for 40 years. He even said that not only are the instructions poorly written but the fit on this thing could be 10x better. Do not waste a minute of your time. I dont even want to give it one star but have to in order to complete this comment.
5,A great magazine....,"Contains the Pontiac Banshee, the Aston Martin Virage, Gembella Testarossa, the rare 1958 AC Ace-Bristol Zagato, BMW M5, Ferrari 408, the ISO Grifo GL just to name a few of the 16-cars covered in this issue."
1,unusable product due to shipping,Bare Ground Solutions BGDS-1 Liquid Snow & Ice Melt Gallon Sprayer and Gallon Solution KitFirst shipment was received without the sprayer advise Amazon of error they responded by issuing call tag and resent the item. Replacement shipment was damaged severly in shipment by FedEx. Notified Amazon upon receipt and they issued call tag but did not resend item.This item appears to have shipping problems. Product never used.
3,Needs improvement,"The solution works pretty good, but the pump sprayer is about as worthless as a 3 dollar bill. Save your money on the sprayer and just buy the solution and pick up a cheap sprayer at the hardware store. I bet it will be much better. Also, there were no application instructions anywhere. I don't know if I should put it down before, during or after ice and snow, or how much solution I should use per application."
2,Not worth buying,"This works, but not well and requires a lot more than the directions indicated to be effective. I started by using the directed amount on my sidewalk 1.5 hrs before getting a little more than 1/8"" of ice, but this ice melt had very little effect. I had to apply more than twice the directed amount to see any results and ultimately ended up salting the sidewalk to allow it to be safe to walk on.In summary: I ended up using 1/2 the gallon bottle ($10 worth) on 30' of sidewalk and still ended up having to apply a normal amount salt (~$1 worth) after the 'Ice melt' didn't work effectively. Product is not worth its price."
1,Disappointed Mystery Lover,"I have to agree with the other ""one star"" review, very, very disappointed in this series. After reading such rave reviews I purchased Sets 1 & 2. I am having trouble even getting through Series 1. Madoc's main character is just not compelling, and his relationship with his daughter is annoying. The only character I liked (or can remember) was his female number 2 - she should have been the main detective. It's not that the stories are weak, they could have been quite good, but the detective work, of which there seems to be little, is ridiculous."
1,More than disappointed,"I have tons of British mysteries on DVD and love them; therefore, I thought I would also love this one from Wales. I was shocked at the poor quality of everything: acting, locale, filming, story lines. It all appeared so amateurish after all the other high-class series filmed in the UK. I was so very disappointed and decided not to watch further episodes after the first DVD. What a disappointment. I could stand it if the acting and filming were first-class -- but that was not the case!"
1,Awful,"Among the worst acting and writing for a British TV mystery series we have ever watched. My wife is a Brit and I lived there 12 years. We have a large collection of TV dramas of this genre. This is embarassingly bad. Film noir? Blimey, you can hardly see the characters it's so dark. Madoc has done better than this."
1,signal strength,I installed them in a 20 year old house and the signal strength was so low around 4 to 10 mps that it was really unusable. I tried different locations with the same effect.
1,Sent it back,"I will start by saying I am sure results with this product vary from install to install due to the interaction with the powerline. My home is about 50 years old. I was running from one room to another - about 60 feet away, but the power lines were being feed from the main circuit breaker box, so the signal had to go through there first. The nodes were NOT on the same circuit.I could bearly get Internet surfing speeds. Even regular DVD's where jerky and unwatchable. My main reason for getting these was to stream DVD's on a server in one room to my media server in the home theater room without running CAT5 cables through the attic.So these totally were unacceptable for my situation. I did have a Zwave lighting system in the home theater room, but I unplugged all the controllers and that did not appear to help, so the slow ethenet speed was not a result of the Zwave traffic on the power line.My suggestion is buy them and try them, send them back if they don't work for you."
3,Not fast enough for me,"I bought this to stream HD video to an XBox 360. I had been using a G router with a bridge only going about 20 feet. This works ok, but I occasionally get some network congestion (if I run a cable it is perfect). Based on the reviews I thought that powerline would be better. Unfortunately for me Powerline was significantly slower than Wireless G. I only got about 10MB. My house is about 7 years old, so I though it would work perfectly. Apparently others have had really good luck with the system. For me, it's just not fast enough. When N bridges start showing up I'll give that a shot."
4,Good product,"Product works as promised. Internet speeds are shaky though - A receiver plugged in very close to the transmitter shows almost no drop in speeds. However another receiver plugged in the second floor shows almost a 50% drop in speeds. In any case, since I started with cable broadband internet speeds, the difference is minimal if any."
3,It gets the job done,"I bought this product after moving my son's Xbox into a room without an ethernet port. The powerline ethernet approach is a quick solution, but it's not cheap; if you have the time, hire someone to drop a new line into the room you want to use.Getting the adapter working wasn't as simple as advertised, but I live in an old house. I had to play around with different combinations of AC outlets before getting the units to work. Three weeks later, I've heard no complaints about the video games lagging due to a slow connection."
2,Great idea just did not work for me,I read all the good reviews but i never got it above 15 mbs. It was much slower then my wireless connection. I have a two story townhome. PC upstairs in second bedroom and other unit downstairs by tv. house is only 10 years old so no way it is bad wiring. I tried it on the 360 media center and never even got to an acceptable standard TV level only 3 bars. Very disappointed. I hope people have better luck then i did. I returned it.
4,Great networking system,Setup was super simple. Just plug in and go. No installation necessary.Highly recommend.
3,The age of your home wiring will impact Netgear's Powerline,"Products using your home's wiring have been under development for several years. Netgear's Powerline HD Ethernet Kit is one of the products that has undergone a few revisions. The net-net of using Powerline devices boils down to the age of your home's wiring and the use of other adaptors within the home. My house was constructed in 1970. The wiring has been updated twice - There are three electrical panels providing more available power than I can use. This is good for the power consumer, but it is a non-starter for Powerline devices. Powerline devices work best when there is a single electrical panel. I love the concept, but returned to Netgear HD Powerline devices because they were not effective in my current situation."
1,Just doesn't work - get the AV modules instead!,"The Powerline HD modules never really worked well. Occasionally we would get a couple of hours of reasonable bandwidth out of them, but generally they just barely squeezed out a connection between them, and our house isn't large. I was considering rewiring the walls for Cat5e cable, but instead I gave the Powerline AV modules a try. Way, way better! Don't waste money on the HD version, buy the AV type because I think you will be much happier. The Powerline AV modules are standards compliant and apparently more sophisticated than the HD type, based on the night-and-day bandwidth difference. Now I get 45Mbit (one test) where with the HD type I got 4, and not even consistently."
3,"OK, IFFY transmission long distances","I purchased this Ehternet Kit because the wireless signal was weak in some portions of my home. I had considered running a hard line from my basement (where the router is located) to my kitchen, but determined that it would impossible to find a route to fish lines through walls and ceilings. The Netgear Ethernet Kit seemed like a perfect solution.The device works well, but not on all circuits. For example, in my kitchen (which does not share the same electrical circuit as the router in my basement) I get excellent communications speeds. It is almost as fast as my direct broadband connection. I've tried the Netgear receiver in other (more distant and perhaps more distant electrical circuit) parts of my house and it doesn't work at all.This product is amazing in concept and works really well in some instances. If it does not work for you, consider trying a ""repeater"" for boosting your wireless signal to distant parts of your home or office."
2,Had a hard time getting interested in this book.,"I love to read and enjoy Carla Negger's books very much, but for some reason I had difficulty staying with this book. I took me a few weeks to finish this one. I usually read a book in 1 to 2 days. Perhaps it was the storyline itself?"
4,Jabra Bluetooth Mono Headset,"The only downfall of this product is that Jabra did not consider people with smaller ears - earpiece does not fit comfortably in my ear and pops out frequently. Otherwise, the product was engineered great in terms of sound being very very clear for both calls and music."
4,good bluetooth.,"I wasn't actually able to use it for my radio-cell phone, but bluetooth had good reception."
1,Incorrect Product,"The Jabra BT8010 Bluetooth Mono/Stereo Headset with attachable speaker did not ship, but instead, a Motorola Rocker BT50 cell phone battery was shipped. Ambient Weather has sent a return label and I have returned the battery for a refund. The product desciption is incorrect for this page and the picture of the battery is what is for sale. I don't know why Amazon has not corrected this error. I have wasted a week getting the wrong product and had to buy the BT8010 from someone else."
2,dissapointed,at 1st this worked very well with my 2nd gen. iTouch. now i can't use it at all because it jumps and cuts out.
4,Love it,I took one star off because the piece that hooks over your ear keeps falling off. That has been my only complaint with it thus far. I only use to buy motorola bt but not any more this ear piece is great.
4,"Great Earpiece, Stereo Feature Just Doesn't Work With Treo 755p","This is a great earpiece for speaking on the phone. The noise cancellation and microphone are amazing. It will pick up a whisper clearly. Wind noise is not a problem either. However, my Palm Treo 755p does not support bluetooth music playing, so I can't use the stereo function without buying an adapter for the phone. Only complaint is that the over-ear hook can get a little loose at times, allowing the earpiece itself to jiggle and move away from the ear."
2,sound is great but it keeps falling apart,As the title says. The reception of the product is great but the earloop keeps falling off. You can not wear it comfortablly while wearing sunshades.
3,earphone,This makes my ear hurt if i wear it very long. The sound is good but i can only wear it for short periods
2,Jabra BT8010 - buyer beware,"I purchased this from a vendor that had a miss leading title. Most of these are sold as a Mono unit. But lots of listing add the words Stereo or Dual. If you end up with a mono unit, it is pretty impossible to find the other add on stereo unit. Also Jabra quality is top notch but note this unit is BT8010 is an anker boat- big, and bulky. For 14-17 bucks the mono is kinda worth it, long as no ones see you. If you can get both unit, the true stereo for 20 bucks it is a steal. I didn't and vendor did really nothing. Would I do it again, no!"
4,The only one out there,The only blue tooth for cell phone that can also play music. Great sound. Less complaints during phone conversations then with many other bluetooths. The drawbacks: 1) hypersensitive to movement - often skips tracks unless stabilized for walking/rollerblading 2) Will freeze phone if turned off during conversations. The only way to avoid it is by turning the bluetooth off by using a phone menu. Still beats my motorola H710 anyday
4,Great for Bluetooth but not V-Cast Music.,Great for Bluetooth compatibility.Does not work with V-Cast Music. :( Poor instructions. Had to go to Google for information.
5,Wonderfull little movie,Very well done movie interesting extras. Even for adults entertaining a lot going on in the background. For some little kids a little scary( two year old) although our two year old loves it. Good story. Love it.
5,Cute Movie,The grand kids loved this video. Also brought the Gruffalo's child which the grand kids also loved. Great short movie for children.
5,Great film!!,If you love the book - you will love the film.I was so excited to learn who voiced the characters. Classic.We watch these on family movie night and the kids still beg to read the book.
1,Implausible plot!,"This book is complete nonsense. Everyone knows there is no such thing as a gruffalo. We watched this once, and then my kids wanted to watch it again and again and again."
1,Atrocious Shipping Standards to be aware of,"This product was intended for my 6 year old son. He insisted that I get him the Gruffalo as he heard the story in school. I went online, searched Amazon, found it and ordered the DVD version. One week later I get the product in the mail. I opened the package only to find a crumpled DVD case (the case is made of paper). Fearing the worst I gently opened the case and removed the bent out of shape DVD disk. It's not broken. I tried it in vain in my DVD player but it didn't work. Trying to satisfy my already disappointed son I then ordered the Gruffalo in paperback. He read it and loved it. It's the shipping standard that crushed this review."
5,Gorgeous,"The story is fantastic, and the production values amazing - it is a truly enchanting movie. 30 minutes is just right for my toddler, and I have discovered more than one of my adult visitors completely engrossed by it. This is a very important quality is something your little one is going to want to watch over and over again!"
5,The Gruffalo,"We watched this movie with our children and grandchildren last Christmas on TV as a holiday special and everyone loved it. We failed to record it and it was not available in the USA. I saw a recommendation for it in the August Family Fun magazine,now available in a USA compatible DVD. I ordered one for myself,one for my grandchildren,and one for my niece's children. My niece said her girls, ages 2 & 4, watched it 3 times in a row the day they received it. Wonderful family movie, very clever and imaginative."
4,Great Movie,A really cute story that kids and adults will enjoy! The artwork is very similar to the book and it makes a great gift also.
5,a good guess,Had never heard of this one but couldn't resist the price. We were all surprised. All the kids I have shown this to have wanted to see it again and again. Brilliant! So many lessons to talk about afterwards.
3,A Treeful of Pigs,A Treeful of Pigs is a book that teaches a lesson. A lazy farmer sits in bed all day and sleeps while his wife takes care of the pigs. The farmers wife finally tricks him to get out of bed by hiding the pigs and telling him that they are lost. This book shows that you cannot be lazy and rely on others to get the work done.
4,"Not Lobel's best, but fun","I teach young children and they enjoy this story. We count the pigs on each page and sometimes I lead a chant like: ""One two three four, five six seven eight, nine ten eleven twelve pigs!"" From some of these reviews, it seems like people overanalyze this story quite a bit! It's just a silly story, and children know that. My only quibble is that the illustrations are a bit too complicated for very young children, who prefer bold and big pictures. But it's wonderful for kindergarteners and first graders."
3,Good guide to refresh your skill,"After read this book, I found it help me to refresh back my knowledge in making love that I have learned before. Overall this book can be a good guide for couple who have just got married and also for whom does not have any formal knowledge in that subject. If you are looking for a sex guide with cheap cost, I suggest you should try this book."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read....,"This is the first and last priest book I'll ever pick up, good thing I managed to get a refund. Priest's writing skills are laughable, it's amazing this thing ever was put into print."
5,Creepy,"Gecko is a great story. Without a doubt the first half is a 5 star read. The second half is less suspenseful, and I would give 4 stars for an average of 4 and a half. Jim Monday is a Vietnam vet who is used to killing. However, after the death of his best friend in what are mysterious circumstances, Jim begins to notice little green geckos everywhere. Jim knows there is some connection between these geckos and the strange German man who has stolen his wife from him. To compound the problem, Jim either has the conscious of a young Australian woman trapped in his brain, which he has a week to save before the murder of her physical body, or he is merely going insane. It is hard to tell which would be preferable.The tension builds until Jim discovers that some of the geckos are not so little - and then the book gets really gory.Another great read from Bootleg Press. Buy this book for a thrill.Relic113"
3,Good information but partially obsolete....,"I liked this book and the author's easy-going narrative. Elaine Clark is clearly talented and well respected in the voice over field. That being said, the book clearly needs an update. When I bought the ""Second Edition"" I thought I would be getting more up-to-date info. (This may be partially my fault as I guess I did not scrutinize the publishing date before I clicked the ""Buy"" button.) There is half a chapter on ""casette duplication"" and ""cassette artwork""! The section detailing salary expectations is also 8 -10 years behind. We don't want to work that cheap! ;) If there isn't a more recent update, then certain infomation should be completely omitted from the book. Reading the above mentioned sections (and some others) made me wonder what other antiquated advice I may take to heart and then make a mistake as a direct result. If you can buy this book at a discount and keep the above caveats in mind, there is much useful information for your tool belt."
1,Program will NOT work with MAC OS 9,"Sales@SmithMicro.com June 2, 2004SmithMicro, answered as follows, when I complained that the program did not work and asked for a refund.Unfortunately, Hot Fax Message Center Pro for Mac has been discontinued on the count of too many compatibility problems.FAXstf 6.0.3 is still featured on our web site for $59.95, upgrade $39.95. This is sotfware strictly for sending/receiving faxes via your MAC running OS 9.Do not waste your money on this program!"
1,An important and well documented book:,What are we doing in this hand basket and where are we going?That is what comes to mind after reading a book such as this.We cannot afford to keep our heads in the sand.Read this book and make the choices that need to be made. An excellent book. The author has integrity and compassion.Uh oh..I noticed I only gave it one star..oops..it should have five...
5,Works as advertised,"Within weeks after starting to give the fish this food, I did notice more vivid colors."
4,fine,I've used this product before and found this price to be pretty good and I also like the tub as it seals nicely.
5,Tetra Pond Vibrance Floating Pond Sticks,"My Koi get very hungry during the warm months. Every couple of weeks, I'd have to return to the local pet store to buy several smaller boxes of the Tetra Pond Vibrance Sticks. When I first saw the 3.08 lb. buckets on Amazon,I realized that I could save considerably on the food, gasoline and driving time by purchasing food in the larger size. The Koi food was just as advertised, and despite my having opted for ground shipping, it arrived within two days. As a bonus, the bucket is well made and can find many uses around the home when it is empty."
2,dont waste any money on this one,The other reviews have told what it's about. Goes from good ok to dull into screaming games of hide and seek . Alot of chasing about to escape a biting degenerate .The acting is good enough but perhaps playing no more than themselves.This film had a chance at originality if the leading girl had kept going with her hallucinary over-laps than a predictable screen-play.Want a good British horror flick? Watch Creep instead
5,Exciting and Instructive,"This is an inspirational story, and is repeated among the nomadic peoples. I have sent it to 14 year old grandsons and to friends anticipating their first adventure in Africa."
3,It was good,I really liked this book. I would recommend this book for people who like to learn about other peoples lives. I t made me feel proud of what people can accomplish.
3,Far too short,"Just when I thought his life might get interesting, the story ended. Still waiting for that moment when you really want to get into a book. Wouldn't recommend it. Far more enjoyable autobiographical books written by Africans. Thought it was a bit childish actually."
4,Great read,Very easy read with lots of interest for many ages. An amazing story and brilliantly told. Very recommended and a fairly quick read.
5,A Fascinating True Story,"""Facing the Lion"" is a truly amazing story about a boy growing up with his Maasai people in Kenya, and later - through incredible twists and turns in his life - comes to the United States for college, and even an MBA. Joseph Lekuton writes in such a way that one is drawn into his life, and it reflects his loving relationship with his people and the land. He is living a most unusual life, and as far as he has come, he never forgets where he has come from. I can't wait to read volume two!! While it is written for young people, I find it absolutely alluring as an adult, and couldn't stop reading until I was finished. An exciting and uplifting story of what amazing things can happen in the life of one man, and to each of us."
4,The Consequences Of Drive and Choice,"Lekuton's personal account sheds light and beauty on the Maasai culture and the uniqueness of life in the savanna. For those who call Kenya home, it is both a chance to reminisce and an opportunity to explore the diversity in lifestyles. It is an educational story of how one man struggles against the tide and carves out his own destiny. Although sometimes misunderstood, all that he does is carried about to give back to his land and his people, to keep something precious to him alive. He hopes to give his people the tools they need to preserve their traditions and create a better tomorrow. We all need such a purpose driven life - Blessings to Lekuton on his wonderful journey..."
4,Too Good to be this short,Not having been to Kenya let alone Northern Kenya where the Maasai live I believe the book seems to give a good account of the lives of the Ariaal people. It was captivating to learn about the traditions and customs of these amazing people. It also provided insight into how life is experienced based on our perspective- Captivating Inspiring Funny. The only detraction for me is that it was over far too quickly. I guess that is a testament to how interesting a read it was. In the final analysis it is a story of inspiration to those going through hardship- Mountains are made to be surmounted Also it speaks about the need to have pride in your origins and that one does not have to sacrifice one's culture in the pursuit for progress and advancement Kudos to Lemosolai for making pressing onward to your goals and more so for showing tangible commitment to your heritage and people.
4,The African Experience,"This book appears to be written for young people, but gives a good picture of the life of a Maasai boy, as well as his family. It is a quick read, not political, and very enjoyable. Having recently visited in this area, I wondered if our view of life there was accurate. Facing the Lion reassured me that what we saw was real and so was the charm of the people."
5,Ben and Graham for Mr. L,this book is the best book i have ever read it is a touching story and everybody should read it because this book rocks
5,Freaking Awesome,"David Friedman's Moonrise is a great collection of New Age, ambient, and mystical music. Each track is great -- there's not a single bad one in there. There's a mood for everyone on the whole CD. I can see a lot of this stuff being used for film scores. Apparently the cover was created by his brother. I guess creativity runs in the family. This CD is a definite must have for your collection."
2,JumpStart Video DVD Training Guide for Canon EOS 20D Digital Camera,Not worth the money ....if you buy an expensive camera like the EOS 20D you have already the basic knowledge of cmaera and technology and concepts. This DVD is too basic for you.
5,EMBRACE GRACE,"Havent gotten into much of it yet but i can already see i will be more thanhappy with it. Im a ""Liz"" fan. her love for the Lord is what i wish for all womento have!"
3,It wasn't groundbreaking for me...,"...not that I expect everything I read to change my life, but the contents of this title just seemed so simplistic and on the nose. I thought it would be a more in-depth look at how to feel worthy of forgiveness and grace, but it was episodic and conversational. While I don't mind conversation, most of the chapters felt repetitive to me. While I understand that we all need reminders that there is grace for everyone, including me, perhaps this would be better suited for someone who has just become a Christian. I didn't dislike the book; it just wasn't quite what I expected."
5,Blue Eye,I found this a riverting read. The characters fairly gallop over the range like the horses around which their culture revolves. Deep characters and the breathtaking pace left me galloping through the pages with them and wondering when the next book in the series will be done?
5,Absolutely Amazing,"If you are looking for a collection of poetry to make you laugh, cry, and smile, then this is the book!"
5,Lifelong comfort and insight,"This book was the first collection of Merritt Malloy poems that I read. Eventually, I collected the others. But this one I first read in the mid-1970s and continue to turn to it at critical turning points in my life. I would love for her to publish another collection from the perspective of wherever she is now in life."
1,"Not Awful, Dissapointing","Not a bad singer, However these bubble gum songs all kind of run together. I guess its a great album for a 14 year old girl."
2,Couldnt Get into it,"A friend of mine gave me this to listen to, and while its not the worst thing i ever heard, I have to agree with the other reviews that say its great for adolescent girls. However, if thats his target customer, then hes doing a great job. He is , however, a decent singer."
1,little sister loves it,"i listened to this album and thought it was a little too ""cotton candy lipsmacker"". the songs are a bit cheesy and i found it hard to get into the record as a whole. my sister, on the other hand, thinks it's pretty good. oddly enough, she's fourteen."
1,15.99 that i should have spent elsewhere,This is the worst 16 dollar pack of bubble gum I ever bought. If it weren't for digital track display I wouldn't have been able to decipher one song from the next. Though when I handed it down to my 14yr old sister she ate it up like a pack of big league chew.
1,Hmmm...,"Where to begin. This is a guy who seems he can play guitar pretty well, so why is he playing these monotonous songs?I agree with guy who said theyre all kind of similar.Hmmm."
2,"Not Terrible, Not Great","Its OK i guess, I just found the whole thing a little monotonous, the songs lack variety from one to the other, but the guitar work and singing is still pretty good."
5,"""In Treatment"" is spot-on in describing the life-changing therapeutic encounter.","As a therapist in private practice for many years, ""In Treatment"" (Season One)is so authentic and true to the therapeutic encounter it is almost painful to watch. The client issues are germane and identifiable, and the actors simply melt into their roles so effortlessly it beggars description. Byrne is a wonder himself as he deals with his own inadequacies as a therapist, a man untrue to his own ideals, a withholding parent and an absent husband all within the context of the therapeutic sessions and beyond into his own life and work. Diane Wiest did a particularly outstanding job of ""helping the helper"" gain insight into the ways treatment overlaps with his own issues, despite his protestations to the contrary. An absorbing, humorous and revelatory insider's look into the therapeutic process wherein everyone's life is changed, even the viewer's."
5,Incredible/Capitvating,"I was addicted to this series, I think every one can relate to one of the characters, whether or not they want to admit it.The show made you feel like you were a fly on the wall..,the actors wonderful and so believeable. I can't say enough good things about this show.I hope HBO picks this up for a 2nd season."
5,BEST SHOW EVER!,It is amazing to see the lives of the patients unfold and unravel in unison with his life events! Best show I have ever seen...
4,"Great writing/acting, but so intense its draining","This is an excellent show! Great story lines and acting. I found myself burned out after watching each episode since they are so intense. I typically watch TV for comic relief and this is not a show for that so as long as you aren't expecting to laugh or feel relaxed after watching it, enjoy the drama! Good stuff!"
5,Very Well Done: In Treatment,"I purchased this season of In Treatment as I had heard from others that it was a pretty good program. I am a professional in this field and I wondered if the show would be a ""hollywood"" version of mental health and psychotherapy, as if often the case with shows in a particular field of professional practice. I am happy to say that the shows I have watched so far have been excellent. The characters, both patient and the therapist, are very well done, not over played, and at the same time, keep you hooked into the story and closely watching the artful interchange between patient and doctor. I would recommend this series for anyone interested in the fieldyearand for anyone who may prefer artful intellect over mindless action. I would not say the show if enough to get one to buy HBO, but it certainly warrants renting or buying the series a year later when it comes out."
1,I'd Rather Self Medicate!,"I must be watching a different show than the 5 star reviewers - I must be. I'm not even CLOSE to jumping on board with this series.First, I gotta question the casting of Byrne - and I usually like him. All the feigned pensive expressions (oh, wait - he took his glasses off!) and ""tell me mores"" had me literally sighing out loud. Second, who decided people in therapy shoved into a 30 minute segment was interesting or realistic?If you've been to therapy, it ISN'T THAT INTERESTING! Not to mention, shoving 3 acts into a half hour promotes some fairly forced turning points that I personally found contrived at best."
3,Exhausting,"I'm a practicing psychologist and had heard so much about this show that I finally decided to give it a try. I agree with other reviews saying that the acting is great. However, after watching a couple of shows, I just couldn't watch it any more. I found the therapy style annoying and way too dramatic. Therapy works because of genuine connection. Excessive interpretation becomes a barrier to that process. The therapist in this show vacillates between interpretation and getting way to caught up in his patients. So, to me, this show does not remind me of any therapy session I've personally witnessed. Nonetheless, this is a TV show and its goal is to entertain, not train therapists."
4,addicting! cant stop watching!,"I dont have the first season, but a while ago i got a dvd promotion with the first 5 episodes, and i cant stop watching it! i cant wait to finish it and buy the complete first season and the second. i love getting to know all the people, and they are all very complex. sometimes i was cringing other times laughing, and other times in shock. its really a great show, i wish i had HBO, but i cant wait to own all the episodes!"
4,Shadow on the wall,"The series is thought provoking and very well acted. The characters express themselves credibly and draw you into their lives without effort. While sharing therapy with these patients, one is sure to find an issue which will strike home."
1,Don't waste your time,"This wasn't for me at all. Just some chick talking to her shrink..boring. I didn't even finish it. Glad it was free so nothing lost but my time. I would have given ""no stars"" if it would have let me."
3,Amazon needs to update,"Good show, but Amazon needs to update. How is this preorder when I have owned this for the last 3 weeks? Great show, could not stand Laura though. So annoying, she was the only session I could not watch."
5,quiet series but worth it!,My wife works in the clinical Psych feild so she wanted to see this show. I went along with the program(as most of us Husbands/boyfriends/significant others would do ;-}) and quickly found myself caught up in the characters lives and routing for Gabriel Byrne to get things together. The only disappointment was that it seemed to end all to soon. I can't wait to get season 2 as soon as it's available!Doc774
2,mixed feelings - spoiler alert!,"I like the actors and the acting. But the writing has a reality problem, or else I am not interested. For a ""good psychiatrist"" to act out toward his wife is not unthinkable or totally psychotic, but to thoroughly mis-report the event to his own psychiatrist is just a step too far. So I did not get beyond Week 2."
2,Very slow,"Maybe I should have given this more time, but I gave up on this series after 3 episodes...just too slow and boring."
5,BRILLIANT PERFORMERS FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY,"In Treatment is one of the most original ideas for a television series in a long time. Short episodes do not allow for wasted time on useless storyline. Gabriel Byrne's transformation into a therapist is flawless. Between Monday to Friday there are real characters with every day problems that are sure to leave the viewer thinking. HBO you have backed a winning horse yet again, do the not so simple minded viewers a favour continue bringing these original ideas to life."
5,"Brilliant, Just Brilliant!","What an amazing program. The writing is brilliant as is the acting. But more importantly the over all quality of this series is something you NEVER see anymore. The thoughtful insightful details that went into this show, from the always present water theme to the overlapping and mirroring of the main character's issues is unheard of these days. What a gem of forethought artistic endeavor and outstanding acting. The actors are all a notch above anything I would have expected, even from HBO. These are some of the most memorable performances I've seen on the small screen in a long long time if not ever. So worth what ever it costs to have this in your library."
4,hbo in treatment,not too bad. very real life problems and issues that don't get magically solved like many other series.
3,Mostly just entertainment; not much other (educational) value,"In one of the last episodes, Paul expresses that therapy to him seems more about personal connections (and a dialog as a result) rather than the formal psychology training. Similarly, this series is mostly about entertainment thru voyeuristic views into others' emotions, with therapy setting as just a platform.Many inaccuracies and inconsistencies, that just go way beyond logical probabilities and i could not , as they say, suspend my disbelief. For instance, one of the patients is a certified diver who enjoys it very much and even after an year of therapy, the item does not come up, except by accident."
3,Interesting but tedious,"This season has some fantastic acting. However, it just became too tedious for me. There are over 30 episodes, and it takes a long time for the season to develop. I think this was a better show concept in theory than in practice. If you are looking for an action-packed show, this is definitely not for you. It is all about talking, silence, and emotion. Again, I enjoyed that for a while, but I was ready for the season to be over by the end."
3,In Treatment - Season 1,Don't buy this as this is the third time I have purchased the box set and the fourth disc is blank!!!!!
1,Stay in Treatment,I could only watch the first episode and couldn't watch past the first 15 minutes. Hope it's not still on. Waste of time.
2,YAWN,"Watched one episode and fell asleep. If you're curious about therapy, go make an appointment. Booooring!"
1,Poor product for intended use,"These are suppose to be microwave dishes and yet they melt in the MW. If you drop them, they crack. They stain if anything dark is saved in them. There must be better products."
2,I'm a little disappointed,"I have been looking to replace an Anchor Hocking brand microwave cookware set that I bought several years ago at WalMart. I have been unable to find that same product. When I saw the LaCuisine 18 pc Microwave Cookware Set it looked almost exactly like the Anchor Hocking cookware. When it arrived I was disappointed. It is made of a thin, almost brittle plastic and some of the corners of the handles were already chipped off. Another Amazon.com reviewer said that it will break if dropped and I can see that it may be possible to break it if you drop it. I will still use it but not for the original purpose. I was looking for microwave cookware that I could put leftovers in, refrigerate and re-heat in the microwave. This cookware does not appear to be sturdy enough for that type of usage. It looks like it may be used for lightweight food storage, but not well suited for cooking or reheating food."
1,Flimsy Plastic,I found the La Cuisine cookware to look & feel like cheap flimsy plastic. I returned it immediately so I really don't know how good it might have been.
4,Cookware review,The cookware was exactly what I needed. It arrived on time.I am satisfied with the purchase.
1,Very dissappointed with this cookware,"It stained badly the first time I used it to heat up some spagetti sauce, after only 2 minutes in the microwave. Even bleach would not remove the stains."
2,Can't get it to work on new computer even with recomendations from others,"I loved this game as a teen so I was excited to find it. I read that some people had trouble getting it to work, but also saw that others gave a solution to the problem. So I purchased it thinking that I would just follow the other suggestions. To my dismay it will not work for me. I do not know if it is my computer or if the game I ordered doesn't work. Either way I am totally bummed!"
3,good,"Not a good deal of this composer's music is available; it is hard to get a good cross-section to surmise what Basil Kirchen is all about. I have three of his CDs and each is different from the other.Particles is jazz; it starts off with a hard bop piece, then blasts to avant space. Most of the music has no rythmic bottom; clarinets and tuba float in mid air, making little swiggles.I am not trained enough to tell if there is an implied beat or this is completely free time. But this is more along the lines of Art Enssamble of Chicago and some of Anthony Braxton's freest material than it is the rythmic launch of later John Coltrane.This is definately not bad, and worth buying if you like more collective Europian style 1970s avant gaurde jazz as opposed to the 1960s giants.The last track is a short vocal bop track that bookends the album well.Particles won't blow you out of the water, but is a nice listen."
5,Basil Kirchin CD,"Got my product in a timely fashion and I have no complaints. So far the best CD of music by Kirchin is ABSTRACTIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL NORTH; it is far superior to this, and the other releases. - JB"
3,What's in the package?,"There are 18 paddles in the package. Three each of: Purple, blue, green, red, red, and yellow. That wasn't a typo, I got six red and three of everything else. I assume I was supposed to get 3 orange ones instead of the repeat reds. Each paddle has a clear, polished part on the handle and down the center of the head and two different textures on the head. See customer photos for more info."
2,Not flying...,"This release is mostly well-recorded, but, well, the Airplane was not what it had been anymore. More rock-oriented than before and sometimes going nowhere (nowhere interesting, at least), the band sounds loud but flat, unimaginative, and, to make matters worse, the vocals are not in tune AT ALL. Grace's voice was not the same, it sounds ragged (notably on ""White Rabbit"") and Kaukonen's guitar is all over, but not to good results.It is obvious that Dryden (a very, very, really very good drummer) was not suitable for the band anymore. Subtelty was just vanishing and the band ended being just a monotonous band.The cd jacket features one of the most beautiful band photos, taken at golden times, by the way. Jorma's liner notes do not say much.Well, I do not recommend this, as you can guess.(For those lookinf for Airplane live recordings, I recommend , of course, ""Blessed Its Pointed Little Head"", ""Fillmore East 1968"" and the concert at Monterey Pop Festival (in that order)."
5,Almost as good as Bless Its Pointed Little Head,"This is a great cd, capturing the Airplane on an exceptionally good night. The version of ""Volunteers"" is better than any other live version of the song I've heard and ""The Other Side of This Life"" is a powerful mixture of the ""Bless its..."" version and the earlier trippier versions of the song. ""Ballad of Me and You and Pooneil"" is also magnificent. Jack's bass palaying is fantastic, Jorma shows why he is the most underated guitarist in rock history and Grace sings in key! BUY THIS CD!"
4,One Song Makes You Larger...,"This is not ""Bless Its Pointed Little Head,"" but I am so happy I purchased it. The recording is a mixed blessing - some songs are first rate an inspired and Jorma and Jack soar - inspired by their Hot Tuna collaboration. Very interesting to hear ""Uncle Sam Blues (Live)"" having owned it for years on the Hot Tuna live recording. The Other Side Of This Life (Live) is the best performance on the record and ""Volunteers"" and ""Good Shepherd"" are also solid. You Wear Your Dresses Too Short (Live) has vapid lyrics (what was Marty thinking), but there is a moment of frenzied perfection in it, so I will not delete it from my iPod. Four and a quarter stars. School of Rock album, honestly."
3,"Raw, rough but a value to JA fans","Since us boomers can be very sentimental about our favorite bands, it's no surprise that these 'far less than stellar' archive recordings keep getting released. Concert expierences are way more than the sum of their audio recordings. With that said, there is a nostalgic value to a recording like this that has a handfull of great moments of dynamic power ('volunteers' is good) but overall has plenty of poor playing and siging (Good Shepard where Jorma's singing is just embarassing). To me it sounds like they couldn't hear each other in the monitors. Without a doubt it doesn't come close to the definitive live airplane (that being, ""Bless it's Pointed Little head""). I never got to see the Airplane live, not quite being of concert going age yet at the time. But i can understand the warm feelings this brings to all the reviewers and responders who were there. It does make me dream about seeing this great band."
5,I liked this one,"There are some new previously unreleased live recordings of the Airplane on the market. This one is good, and from their best period. I loved the Airplane in that period, when I consumed illegal substances; crimes for which the statute of limitations has expired. This has material from early Airplane through Volunteers.The Airplane's musical and technical genius is best reflected in their studio recordings. This is a very good live recording of an excellent sample of their music. If you think you don't have enough Jefferson Airplane records you can buy this one."
1,what a waste of $$,Rubbish. totally not what I was looking for. Doesnt erase properly. No fun. Trashed it.
1,not satisifed,i still have not received this product and after emailing the seller three times i still have not been contacted by them. i have no idea if this has even been mailed to me yet. no tracking number given. very poor customer service contact. i am not pleased with customer service at all
2,disappointing,"This book rather disappointed me. I loved the information at the beginning to help you find his style and designs that work well with certain body types. However the patterns left something to be desired. I am a young knitter with a young male to knit for and these patterns are more suitable for an older man. She also uses cables alot and the men I knit for prefer simple designs. She also has more vest and cardigan patterns than pullovers. I was hoping for a more overall male appealing book. However my dad would love some of the vests, so if that is his thing this book is for you. For younger guys though check out Simple Beautiful Sweaters for Men."
3,Basketcase jacket: impractical choice of wool recommended by the author,"Basketcase jacket: impractical choice of wool recommendedLove the patterns in the book, my husband chose the pattern he wanted to wear. Following the author's recommendations I chose Rowan big wool in smoky. My husbandloved the jacket wore it for a week and then the jacket looked like it was ancient.The yarn had pilled - there are big balls, small balls all over the jacket. There was yarn dangling from the sleeves, elbow area. Not a nice sight. The jacket has since been sitting in the closet. 2years ago the yarn cost $200 and it took me a week to finish the jacket :("
1,falsely advertised,"They advertised that this would keep working for 3 months but when you get the product, the label says you must apply it an hour and a half before it snows. I don't know about your weather, but ours isn't that predictable. I applied when the weatherman called for snow but no snow. If it lasts 3 months, it should still work when it does finally snow, right? Didn't! And if the weatherman says it's going to start snowing at FOUR in the morning, I'm not getting up at two thirty to apply it. IT's SUPPOSE TO WORK FOR THREE MONTHS. How is that possible if you have to apply it an hour and a half before snow?"
1,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE","I wish I had read the one other review before I purchased eye drops for my dog from this seller. Not only did they not send the brand advertised but they sent me eye drops for people. I am neither a vet nor a doctor but I would imagine that dogs should not be using the same medicine that is made for humans. And if I was selling medication online and used the title Revival Animal Health, at minimum I would be selling things FOR ANIMALS!!!"
2,Less for More,"For the size and price of this volume, there is very little in here. For example, there is no mention of Bankart lesions, a common injury that is not discussed in its short description of shoulder instability. Surprisingly there is more information in the thinner and cheaper Kaplan book. Perhaps his new edition is an improvement."
1,Not a good workout!,"While the instructor in this DVD had a lot of energy and an upbeat attitude, the workout is barely 18 minutes long. It isn't challenging, and it doesn't have much flow. For instance, the women working out behind the instuctor are out of step and seem to be struggling to follow him. For half of the workout, he does arm lifts, but seems to be doing them his own way. Half of the women following him interpret them one way (arms up) and the other half does arms to the side. If this reveiw seem confusing, it is because that's how the workout was!"
3,not their best but true death metal,"on first listen this is different good?bad? different? then comes the new guitarist catstrangeling his axe shiit!get allen west back on the road or at least let him write and record new stuff i'm not very fond of this change but I can't say it suck either.objeckively it's good better than back from the dead but not cause,the end or frozen or even world demise.their newest one dark day seams a little better but ralph still dosn't fit and plays a different type of guitar than obituary needs!allen must return!"
2,Guitar wanker Santolla,"This album is nowhere near any of the previous Obituary releases. Vocals are a bit ""careful"" and I hate the guitar wanker solos by mr Santolla. I'm a huge fan of Obituary, but this album i a huge let down."
3,underpads are ok,They are fine for daytime but are not as absorbent as some others I found. I need it for overnight protection of the hospital bed.
3,bought these for use with my dog,"Don't buy these for pet use. The padding is very thin and pretty loose inside and the cover tears very easily. It absorbs slowly so the urine runs over the edge even though there is is a WIDE plastic margin on the edge. Maybe too wide. There is no gel action like I am used to with pet pads. Too bad these didn't work - I was hoping to find a large pad that works.As fragile as these are, being a nurse, I can't see how these would work for people either!"
2,flimsy,"The filling material is thin and uneven. It won't stay in place overnight. It may be good for a baby, definitely not for a senior adult."
3,Not a subsitute for puppy training pads,"Someone suggested I use these as training pads for a pup, which they really weren't the best for. I am guessing the good reviews mean that this product is great for the use intended, but I thought I would put this on Amazon in case anyone else was buying them for another purpose."
4,Recommended,"Although it was wonderful visiting with Helen and Milo again this book was more difficult to follow than the first, Steel Ashes. The plot is more convoluted and the tone is much darker.I would still recommend it for those who read the first book."
5,Highly recommended,"The second in the series of Pittsburgh at the turn of the century, this one keeps up the pace of its first book. Though Helen is much angrier in this book than in the first, it's not too distracting. All the other fine qualites, the mood and historical detail and romantic touch continues here nicely. An interesting book to read."
5,The depiction of career women in 1905 was facinating.,"I read ""Blood Tracks"" very soon after I read the author's previous work, ""Steel Ashes"". I found the plot and characters to be mesmerizing. The depiction of the heroine, Helen Sorby, working at the Westinghouse plant was facinating to read, especially for today's working women. As in ""Steel Ashes"", it is difficult to sort out the villians from the heros. The mystery truly keeps you guessing. Fine crafted stories such as these, give one a true appreciation for what our grandparents endured when they immigrated to this country. I anticipate the arrival of her next book, ""Coal Bones""."
2,Frustrating Game,"This game is frustrating, it seems to be a very elaborate game. But compared to the other games like Fighter Ace, the plane model is way too difficult. I fly real planes and I have trouble taking off from this game without damaging the planes. Also from the time I was flying there does not seem to be a lot of people flying.Also, there is only cockpit view, which is realistic. But Fighter Ace at least give you the options of flying in Arcade mode just to have fun or realistic mode to emulate real life.Being a Fighter Ace user wanting to check the other game out, I am disappointed and don't understand what the concept is. It is too bad since they seem to have put a lot of effort in the game and in marketing."
1,What a watse of time,This game is really bad. The graphics Are terrible. If you shoot a plane down it just comes back.If there was a rating of -5 stars this game deserves it.
1,cheap in every way,"I love the Leica lense on my old Lumix, and the original Li-ion battery is a gem, so I figured a cheap charger was well worth it, even if the camera's getting old. This charger looks identical to a dozen others but cost less than four dollars. It quit after one use, leaving me stranded at a crucial time. I took it apart for a visual inspection but couldn't spot any problem that way. I figure I must have got what I paid for. I ordered a new one with a different name on the outside for 19.95--but it looks identical in design. So far it works fine."
5,One of the best Seattle rock records. Ever.,"From the beginning feedback roar and squeal of the superlative Avalanche, through the comtemplative pit stop of Intro Vigilante, this record sets itself up alongside Archers of Loaf and SuperChunk as some of the most interesting, angular and tuneful indie-guitar rock you've ever heard. This record represents the high watermark of NSB, who are sadly no more, and is highly recommended. While the second half isn't as strong as the first, I find that this record remains one of my faves of all time. Grab this record if you can!"
3,it's made by the chi-coms,"Bought this for a resto-rod project, haven't finished install at this time, so I can't rate it for functionally. I thought since it was a ""Raybestos Pro Grade"" it would be made in USA. Opened the package at the shop, bragging about the ""quality"", then saw it was made in China. A short but vicious rant ensued, followed by incessant teasing from fellow workers. Item looks fairly good, clean inside reservoirs. Hope the melamine filler won't adversely affect performance."
1,Don't waste your time with this one. So BAD it's a joke!,"This is a biography? Since when do conjecture, misquotes, factual errors, personal opinion and false info constitute a biography? Who edited this thing? Who checked it out? Did these people dream this? What Judy Garland are they talking about anyway? It is so bad that it is comical. The color photos by the way, seem to have reproduced poorly, too. The only good thing about this book...they used nice paper."
1,Poorly Written Garbage!,"This is a terribly written book! The inaccuracies have already been addressed by others, so I won't repeat them. Suffice to say the inaccuracies became so numberous, I stopped reading at page 38. Did the writers even bother to research anything? Was the editor asleep? Nice pictures, but don't bother buying this turkey."
1,WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE AWFULNESS!!!,I have to say that this book is the poorest excuse of a Judy bio I have ever read! It's a disgrace! How in the world did this get printed with all those lies and errors?! I don't even have words to describe my disgust! I feel so sorry for the authors if they have to resort to telling lies about the greatest female entertainer that ever lived just to make money! Judy was the most fantastic singer/actress of all time and I am indescribably angry at how the authors portray her! I am only 16 and I know more about Judy than those authors who supposedly researched her to write the book! How in the world can they even think they know all about Judy when they never even knew her? My advice is that if you want to read about Judy then read Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir by Lorna Luft. Lorna is Judy's own daughter and she knows the facts because she was there. Get the facts from Lorna and don't waste your money on the Beyond the Rainbow rubbish!
1,My opinion of this book? LET THERE BE SILENCE!!!,"I have worshipped Judy 4 25-26 years! Her legacy is astounding - and she continues 2 enrich my life!This book(I WON`T EVEN MENTION THE WRITERS NAMES) is like dancing or spitting on Judy`s grave. There are 2 many numerous faults - in this book - worth mentioning....The photographs are good, but years and their origins are 2 often wrong....Please! If I were the publisher I would withdraw it from circulation. Liza, Lorna, Joey and Sid have plenty AMMUNATION for a lawsuit....This book makes me cry! The authors HAVE NO SYMPATHY for its subject whatsover....If u wanna read how CRUEL persons can be 2 other people; READ THIS TRAVESTY...."
1,The WORST book on Judy EVER,"I find it strange that all the previous reviews on this book have been erased from Amazon. Was it because all of them told the TRUTH about this book, that it is full of errors, misquotes, misidentified photos, wrong chronolgies and just plain garbage. People wrote great reviews giving the real picture behind this drsgraceful piece of journalism. Did anyone notice that the book doesn't even have an editor listed. Little wonder. Who would want to own up to this terrible travesty?"
1,"Awful, simply awful -- full of errors and bad analysis","Simply one of the worst JG books around. I was astonished at the number of factual errors, misidentified photos and strange and often unsubstantiated analysis. Up until now, I had respected Morley as a Theater Critic, but if this is the level of his work, he will now go unread. The text is dreerily written and fails to offer any original insight into JG's life, career or psyche. Clearly, the writers just needed a check, so they slapped this junk out. For anyone looking for a solid book on JG, I recommend both Christopher Finch's RAINBOW and John Fricke's JG: The World's Greatest Entertainer. Between the two, you'll get the best sense of the talent, the person and the persona. The publisher and editor of this junk should be truly ashamed."
1,The absolute worst money can buy. No stars.,"As biographers and journalists, Morley and Leon fail miserably; as fans, they fare even worse. Not even worth an ""E"" for effort, this sensationalistic, error-filled tome has as much to do with Garland's life and career as Mel Torme's (awful) book had to do with her '63-'64 television show. As evidenced by the appallingly innacurate captions, the authors don't even have the wherewithal to differentiate between obviously posed publicity photos and actual candid shots-- much less between the facts and fiction of Garland's life. Do yourself a favor, leave this one on the shelf and rush right up to the counter and demand a copy of John Fricke's inestimable Judy Garland: World's Greatest Entertainer. You won't be able to put it down."
1,putrid! where is the BOMB icon?,"i agree with all the reviews so far! the saddest thing about this book is that it continues the myth that the actors playing the munchkins were drunk, sleazy, and even ""rats."" thanks, mr morley, for making me lose my lunch!"
1,I FEEL SO SORRY FOR JUDY,"This piece of filth should not have been published at all! At best, it should have been published by a British gossip magazine. That's all this book is, besides its terribly amateur writing and inaccuracies. I would bet my eye teeth that these so-called biographers have filled more gossip magazines with trash than most would in a lifetime! I feel so sorry that our beloved Judy's life, while sometimes turbulent, had to be all blown up out of proportion and jazzed up for the purpose to make a buck. Many stories in here, even anecdotes, I can say are untrue, or at least in bad taste. These people not only had the nerve to label Judy a lesbian in one chapter, but they say that she had little capacity to love! If that isn't the biggest piece of crock I ever heard, I don't know what is. Just read Lorna Luft's excellent memoir, and you'll get the absolute truth behind all this bull these Brits have turned out! And as for Judy, you're wonderful, I love you, I always will!"
1,A vicious piece of garbage,"Obviously the authors are ripping off Judy's name for the money. What other excuse can there be for writing this piece of crap? At first I was happy to see another Judy book hit the market - especially one with such lovely photos. But after I started to read it, I was horrified. As I browsed through the text, I got sick. I am shamed to even admit I have this book in my collection. What a vicious piece of garbage! And these authors have the nerve to say they love Judy..."
1,The Christmas present from hell!,"Whether you are or aren't a fan of Judy Garland, don't buy this book. It is simply awful. I'm only 15 and even I found lots of mistakes. The pics aren't anything new and some have the wrong labels! I was totally disappointed."
1,a discraceful bio on miss garland,"with mislabled pictures and a complete lack of true factual information, this book is a grotesque misrepresentation of miss garland. after reading this piece, i was disgusted with the outlandish claims made by mr. morley on behalf of the legend that is judy garland."
2,Elementary in his presentation,"I was very much anticipating the receipt of this work, because I was looking for critical evidence of the influence of Paganism in Christianity. Although there are references he uses, many of his thoughts, it seems, are just his beliefs stated with minimal or no support. Now I don't disagree with most of what he had to say but in many areas he must assume that support or an extended explanation is not needed. In many ways it reminds me of the writings of a non-professional parishioner discussing his non-orthodox beliefs written down for others to read rather than a scientific textual critique of the subjects. I wanted more extensive justification of how or why such and such might have ended up the way it was. He needed to make a case for much of what he talked about, but he did not. This would not be a work that a critical thinker could use to raise doubt in the mind of orthodoxy."
3,slightly better than the first,"I'll admit this book is better than the first, but it is still only an average book. The two qualities that stick out in my mind is the further development of Peter. Watching the path he is taking, well it is disturbing to see. The other gem in this book is Bradbury's short story, ""The Sound of Thunder"" which is the story that started this series. And believe me, after reading Bradbury at the end, you realize just how 'average' Stephen Leigh is. But it has made me curious enough to read the next book in the series. I'll let you know how that one turns out."
3,Wrong age in description,"This is a nice puzzle, but the manufacturer's recommended age is 5 not 3, like it is stated in the listing. This puzzle is definitely not for beginners."
5,"Fun, Sexy, Must Read",This was a very funny and enjoyable read. The two main characters and sub characters were hilarious and the dialogue was fantastic. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
4,Review of Sermons by J.M. McGarvey,"The content of this book is exactly what was expected. However, the condition of the book (hardcover, pages, etc.) is slightly less than anticipated. Overall satisfaction is ""pass."""
5,The future is already there,"There is a lot going on in academic and commercial labs that are rather invisible to the ordinary public. The results however have the potential to change our life completely. This book gives a very thorough insight into current developments. And more, it also helps you to imagine how these technologies are being used in the real lives of persons.We face the unique challenge in the coming years to use new technologies and at the same time take our responsibility towards sustainability of this planet. This books shows a lot of potential in innovative use of materials and processes that makes it possible to make right choices.Highly recommended for anyone interested in not only new technologies, but also in the impact and actual use."
3,WITHOUT SAM WATERS THE SERIES WAS NOT THE SAME,"SAMANTHA WATERS WAS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS SERIES; HER STORY CAPTIVATED THE AUDIENCE, SO WAS DIFFICULT TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW FACE. THE SERIES WERE NEVER THE SAME AND THE WRITERS, IN A DESPERATED MOVE TRY TO RECREATE THE SAME STORY FOR THE NEW PROFILER BUT THE AUDIENCE DIDN'T SHOW INTEREST...BUT, THIS IS AN OK SEASON...MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT...WHO KNOWS!!"
4,Blizzard of One,"Blizzard of One is a surprisingly witty, smart collection of poems. This is the first collection of poems I have read by Mr. Strand and I was delighted with the book. The poems approach everyday topics, and pushes past the ordinary. Blizzard of One draws on everyone's fears of death and suggests that death is not what is to be feared, not living life is. Blizzard of One is a wonderful collection and I would recommend it to all with even a slight interest in poetry."
4,"Quite, quite fine","Is Strand John Donne? Hardly. Is he Yeats? Alas, no. But he may be among the very best of living poets, and this has several poems worth re-reading.I look for more from him of the caliber of ""Keeping Things Whole."" Until then, this volume is a good consolation."
5,Beautiful Watches,"This book will be a must for collectors. What interested me, aside of the history of the company, was the beauty of the watches. When you see what the new ones look like, what a shame we have gone away from those designs. The fashionable stuff is horrible. Would you wear a Swatch? This book is a tour through good taste, utility and beauty in design."
2,Wish it was better.,"This is a very nice looking knife. Everyone I showed it to loved the finish on it, but I was always wiping off fingerprints. The blade itself is really good quality and very sharp. The size was a little smaller than I thought it would be but not that bad. I would have kept this knife but the assist opening, which was awesome, quit working after just two days. I actually like Kershaw knives and think they make good products. I probably was just unlucky and got a lemon. Since I had to send it back I decided to try another knife but I feel sure a replacement would probably have worked fine."
5,Flawless,"This is a wonderful little pocket knife. Out of the several knives in my collection, this one is my favorite for everyday carry. This little knife will perform every function flawlessly right out of the box with one hand. Opening and closing the blade, clipping and unclipping the clip-on, and the blade is very sharp right out of the package. I love it, and you will too!"
3,Dekok and the Geese of Death: Review,"I am a huge fan of the series and can no longer get it in a timely manner. (when I hear about new translations). It is an excellent story and the characters are well drawn. This book gives you a portrait of life and police work in an excellent way.Though based in Holland, the author is in the league of Agatha Christie and Ed McBain, Outstanding!The seller was on time and excellent as always, this was part of a great gift."
5,SUPERB! A must-buy,"Yes, this is one of the very best books from Cisco Press.I haven't checked it for errors yet, but the depth & breadthof topics covered makes it an apparant must-have."
5,A must read for Cisco Security Certifications,"This is one of the first books I read for anyone preparing for CCIE Security. I found this book to be very comprehensive in its approach. The author has combined all the network security technologies in one book and now this is tough. It starts with an Introduction and then builds on that. It covers the whole nine yards VPN's Firewalls, IDS, Access Control. The Troubleshooting part of the book is very helpul to working professionals as it starts with troubleshooting NAT and then covers everything from Firewalls (PIX and IOS), VPN's, IDS and AAA. A lot of issues can be resolved just using this part of the book. I recommend this book as it will surely help everyone looking for everthing about security. This book is a must read for professionals pursuing the CCSP and CCIE Security Certifications.Niloufer Tamboly, CISSP"
5,Lots of options,"A typical Citadel Warhammer plastic model kit - a good thing to be. Plenty of options for loadout. Had I thought about it a bit longer, I would have made liberal use of magnets to make the large weapons (and even hands) exchangeable. As it is, when it finally gets painted, will be a magnificent (and deadly) centerpiece to be dealt with. Stands about 6 inches tall."
1,amazon,I was outside of the guarantee period due to the vendor stringing me along. The vendor is MedicaRite. Amazon did me the same thing and I had proof of return. They only stand behind their profit and vendors. Even in the face of proof of fraud by a vendor. Amazon will stand behind the vendor and screw the customer.
5,Tugboat Annie Tears it Up,"I saw Tugboat Annie open up for the Sheila Divine at the Paradise in Boston about two weeks ago and loved their music. You should not only buy this cd, but keep an eye out for Tugboat when they come to your city. Can't wait for their new release to come out so that I can own the ""Wishing Song""."
2,Don't Waste Your Money.,"I'm sorry scripted worship services wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting fresh ideas rather than a script. If you are looking for something to read this is not the book. However, if you are merely wanting to copy something that has already been done then this is the book for you. Not really a postmodern worship guide at all."
4,Good for aspiring writiers,"I am an aspiring writer myself and I must say this book has been a great help. It has a chapter dedicated to every element necessary for a well written story; Character, Setting, Voice, Plot. There are also very useful exercises that help you develop your skills in each of the necessary aspects. It also helps you write every day, which is something any writer should be doing. Over all it is a very helpful book and in the short time I have had it I have poured out two short stories that, in my opinion, are much more full than anything I have written before."
2,Imaginative Writing: The Elements of Craft (Penguin Academics Series),"I received the item in a timely manner. However, upon opening the box, I was disappointed to find that this gently used book was actually loved to pieces. The cover was almost torn off and the book was missing several pages. Not Cool!"
2,Marginal,"I used this book in a class. I didn't find it very helpful, since many of the chapters are rather abstract. It rambles around without getting to the point in many instances. The examples of essays, short stories and poems were very uninteresting and uninspiring. I guess if you like negative, sensationalized American stories, you won't mind. However, I prefer deep interaction among characters with a little story and adventure. It's also pleasant to have stories written with eloquent, beautiful use of language. You won't see that here."
4,Very Helpful,"I had to get this book for a fiction writing class that I took. I actually rented it vis Barnes and Noble and when it came time to send it back I just couldn't do it. It was a great overview of the elements of writing all kinds of fiction, including short stories, poetry and creative non fiction. I have a few other books on the subject and I am happily adding this to the pile. The examples from other authors were especially helpful in driving the point home and inspiring me to do more."
3,Helpful Tool for Class,I was required to purchase this book for a Creative Writing class. It has great example and the instruction is easy to read. The book was in great condition and shipping took only 2 days.
5,Great Book,"AMAZING BOOK. I had a 220 creative writing class in BYU-Provo and we used this book. It is amazing how well structured this is. The information is very extensive but not wordy. It goes into a lot of different things, but it is understandable. Great examples. Very interesting short-stories. I was very happy with the book. Highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to get ideas for creative writing or just to read the short stories."
3,chaise lounge pads,"The pads showed water marks after the first brief rain. That aside, the pads are truly wonderful. Very firm."
2,Where's the fire?,"I find myself unable to enjoy this interpretation of the Tchaikovsky and the Grieg due to the accelerated tempos the artist has chosen. If you are looking for a less traditional rendering, this might be for you."
4,a great buy,"I've had this player for about a month and it works great. I wanted it to take while pet-sitting and have been very pleased. Many of these players break at the slightest jostle. This one has held up with minor abuse from cats, and it still plays great. It's only been a month, but so far, I am very pleased."
3,DVD player with AXI Port for TV Tuner,"I purchased this DVD player mainly to use the AXI Port for the TV Tuner. The DVD player worked great with a DVD movie. However the AXI Port with the TV tuner did not function well at all. I live in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio and can see all of the major TV network transmission towers from my yard. The tuner was not able to pick up any of the lower channels with its included antenna or even when I attached a powered antenna. I do not have cable and needed something I could use as a portable TV. It's a great idea to have a DVD player double as a portable TV; however, they will need to get a better receiver to pull it off. I should mention that I have an 15 year old portable 5"" color TV that I have been using in the same location and I get a great picture without even extending the attached antenna."
1,Stopped working almost immediately,"Extremely disappointed, especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product (and the Axion 7"" player) received.I bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv. The player worked fine for the first DVD we tried, but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black. You couldn't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine. No complaints about the sound I guess, but what good is that if the screen doesn't work?Needless to say I returned this as fast as possible. In fact, if I could rate it less than one star I would, since it didn't even last one day. Terrible product."
1,Awful,"Horrible!Did not have any miniSD or USB slots. Get hot way to easy.Battery heavy+bulky. Tried to return still no answer. I give it 1/5 because of price and screen size.Pros:Price. Screen Size.Cons: Bad picture quality, heavy and bad battery, gets hot quick, wont chanrge and play....many more.Overall: Not worth it....i still cant get rid of mine."
1,NO STARS on this one!,"Do not buy this. I bought this for my husband in December for Christmas and it's broke already in fact it started breaking a few months ago. It keeps saying ""no disc"" parts have broken off. It's a piece of junk. My husband has to put something heavy over the cd cover to watch a movie. DO NOT waste your money on this junk!"
2,Should have chose differently.,"I am almost 65; have never played a muscical instrument and want to play guitar. Full size guitars are too big for me (I have short arms and small hands.) This guitar is still too big and the steel strings will not stay tuned. I have a friend who does play guitar and he said he would have sent it back. I thought it was just my inexperience, but he cannot get it in tune or keep it in tune for even a couple of songs."
1,Thanks a lot!!,"""Santa"" brought this guitar to my 6 year old, who only wanted a guitar for Christmas, and while he was setting it up on Christmas Eve he noticed that there was major damage on the bottom of it, like it had been dropped. It had been double boxed and there was no sign of damage in shipment....someone had put the damaged guitar in the box at the store :( The guitar itself is adorable but it's going to be pretty hard explaining to my daughter that it needs to be returned.....maybe the elves did it??? GRRRRR......"
4,Good starter,"Our daughter loves the guitar, mostly because it is pink. She played with it for two years, but now is actually taking lessons. Her instructor noted that the neck is not very true, but that could partially be from the two years of it being more of a toy. It does sound Ok -particularly for the cost."
5,Great Purchase,"I am very glad with this purchase, this guitar has a great finish and sounds great. It has metal strings (I would rather have nylon strings for my niece, though), the painting is superb and tunes nicely. I was looking around in the department stores for a guitar but they were just toys and I wanted something more durable and serious, I found it at Amazon.com. Excellent product for the price!"
4,great gift,I gave this to my daughter as a birthday gift. She was thrilled I found it in pink. Good for a beginner.
4,Not bad for the price,"This was a Christmas gift for my wife. Plays great, nice and loud for an acoustic. I had a friend do a set up on it and he said it was excellent for the amount of money it cost. Most ""pink"" guitars were these small things for kids, this was an actual adult sized guitar for less than $100. How could a person go wrong with that?"
5,Happy little girl on Christmas day,Great value for the money. Quality build and packaging. Came strung and was easy to tune. Nice finish and hardware
2,"Nice guitar, but was chipped","The guitar was a gift for our granddaughter. The guitar is nice, but it has one paint chip on the front. We are keeping as is, so we don't have to hassle with returning it."
3,This is adequate but not recommended,"I was hoping this would be of slightly higher quality but it was so cheaply priced that I knew deep down it would look cheap. I was right. It actually played ok but I can tell this guitar isn't going to last very long. I bought it for my daughter and as soon as I took it out of the box I knew I'd made a mistake. Also, it doesn't mention it but you're gonna need an acoustic strap for this guitar that can tie onto the headstock. There's only one knob on the body. If you want something seriously cheap and you're not worried about how long it lasts, go for it. If you're getting one for someone who wants to learn guitar, I'd go with something a little nicer."
4,great starter,"We were impressed with the sound once it was tuned. very nice and good for a beginner. The first time it shipped the headstock was cracked, but it was replaced very quickly and packaged better the second time with nothing wrong. :)"
4,"Nice Guitar, I Love The Color, But Is Alittle Too Large!","This is an sturdy, excellent guitar; holds its tuning well, has a nice full tone, and feels and looks like a professional guitar. It is a nice and pretty light pink color guitar, with a very attractive white decorated fingerboard. BUT I did not realize how large it was till it arrived, and it takes some effort to stretch my fingers, even though I have very long fingers..."
2,Weakest Lonely Planet Guide Ever,This guide is very different from all the other LP guides I've used over the years. One of my favorite things about LP guides is that they've always rated places to stay in small towns and villages making it easy for me to travel outside the main tourist areas. The wonderful feature is absent from the Wales guide. I also feel like I'm getting much less information in the Wales guide. Other LP guides list things to see and do that I don't think I would have heard about if used a different guide. With the Wales guide I feel like I'm reading a condensed version of government tourist office travel brochures.
4,very nice book on Wales,"I found this book quite helpful on our trip to Wales. It has lots of useful information. I only wish we had more time in Wales to see all of the things I found interesting in the book. One update to the information in this edition - the book mentioned a permanent Dr. Who exhibition in the Red Dragon Center in Cardiff Bay, however, this closed last year. According to our tour guide, there is a new Dr. Who exhibit opening up in Cardiff Bay this summer but we didn't see it. Don't know if it is open or not yet. The book has a very useful section in the back on the Welsh language. It also has nice bits on the history of Wales and other great background information - the book is not just places to go and places to eat. We had a wonderful time on our trip to Wales, I highly recommend Wales as a vacation destination."
2,Functionally useless,"What is the deal with this book? There is NO useful information here!! It reads like a travel catalogue or brochure, advertising locations and things to do without actually giving practical information. This is definitely NOT like other LP guides.Waste of money."
2,Squirrel feeder,"Good idea, have seen several others in action. This version however was made with cheap materials and fell apart in less than a week."
4,Our shubunkins do well on this food,"Our pond is too small for koi, so we have shubunkin. They are obviously well conditioned on this food since they produce a handful of babies every spring before we switch to the summer food."
3,Bloody!,Laymon often wrote some gory stuff..and this is one! Not that great of a read though. Don't think I'd recommend it.
3,Started out great and ended bad,The first book I have read by Richard Laymon. I was told by a friend to read this and after he laid out the plot of the book for me I thought it sounded really good. Well the book did start out great and for about the first 3/4 of the book was really good and then in the end I actually went back and reread the last few pages thinking I missed something. Was very disappointed at how it ended and if this is how all his books are well I wont be reading many more. So I am going to give him another shot.
2,A solid Laymon,"First of all - I like Laymon, I really do. So far I read all of his stories with great gusto, and he almost never disappointed me. Until now. This really isn't his best, but entertaining enough to gobble it up within two to three days. I was quite disappointed when the horrible trip of the three protagonists screeched to an abrupt halt like this - I had expected a little bit more (like the evil raising from the grave to haunt them some more *gg). Nevertheless, if you like gore, suspense and a nice pinch of sex this book is exactly what you need on your bedside table."
3,Not his best...,"This was a shorter, more graphic novel than some of his others. Comprised of nonstop action, but tempered with less characterization than most of Laymon's books that I have read. It wasn't one of my favorites, but it was certainly entertaining. Overall, it seemed like a less mature novel - mostly due to the characters and the rape scenes clearly influenced by _The Entity_. Still, it was a fun book in its own way."
3,Thank God they don't make 'em like this anymore.,"Colleen had been in love with Erik Johansen for as long as she could remember. And now, in just 48 hours, her green-eyed Viking was getting married to another woman, a beautiful model - her own cousin.But when her cousin left him stranded at the altar, Colleen was there to pick up the pieces. She knew Erik had always thought of her as a little sister, but this night he needed her. And she had never stopped needing him. In one night of unforgetable passion, their lives were inextricably joined. BUt suddenly Colleen had a decision to make. Could Erik learn to return her love, or was she tied forever to a man she would never really posses?--ME: This book is typical from the 1980's. It has a pathetic heroine pining for a man that doesn't even notice her. It's the virgin against the slut. Oooh, who will he choose?"
1,Poor sound quality,Listening with headphones you can hear the flip side of the audio cassette playing in reverse. It is very distracting. I returned my set. If anyone knows of a quality recording of this work - please post.
2,Unforseen Problems,"This weathervane is beautiful. I called it Blue Heron Lifting Off Into Flight. It also assembled quickly and easily with a minimum of tools. However, the major defect is the copper construction, which could be detrimental to my metal roof, which is constructed with aluminum. These two metals are not compatible. As the rain comes down on my beautiful weathervane, it will drip components from the copper onto my aluminum roof and will eventually destroy it. An aluminum roof has a lifetime warrantee, but the roofer will not warrantee it with the copper weathervane on it, since the copper can harm the aluminum. Even though the pieces touching the roof are not copper, the rain on the copper will run down the roof. You need to be aware of this fact, before choosing a weathervane."
2,Doesn't fit right.,I got this outfit for my 6 year old daughter. She is average for how tall she is and this outfit doesn't cover her bottom totally. It is very short and does not come with anything under it. I would not advise purchasing this uniform. Most cheerleading uniforms are shorter than a normal skirt but this one fits great on the top and then stops short. It didn't look right when she had it on.
5,Organic greatness,"I just started an Organic Outreach on my campus and ordered this product on a whim. Once students tried them, they kept calling back for more. I couldn't even keep any on hand for ME to enjoy :)"
2,No Save Ability,"This is a great idea for a portable game, but you can't save!It is possible to allow saving on a GBA cart, but this title does not allow it. These are long games, but you CAN NOT save.Without being able to save, who wants this???I bought it, knowing this was a possibility, but it's horrible.Do not buy this if you ever want to continue a game at a later time."
1,I like this 3 games in a board edition.,"I bought this game because I love Risk board game, and Clue. Then I have great expectations with this game but Risk is just an random numeric game after a few matches I been bored, Clue is very predictable is boring. But if you don't have nothing to do and you want waste time Battleship is the answer, is the most funniest game between the other two piece of crap."
3,Not quite for Dummies and getting a little old,"I'm perhaps too much of a dummy for this book, but even I realized that the '98 edition seems somewhat outdated in the networking game. Still, it did help reinforce some concepts.I won't be able to give up on our networking consultant just yet."
1,"Lacks Depth, Borrow - don't buy","From the reviews and excerpt, I was expecting more insight into the specific challenges of multiples. Either there truly aren't that many differences, or this author was just too busy to go into any depth (understandable). This is basically a collection of two-sentence blurbs on everything under the sun. You will not find much that you have not seen in other books, on-line chatrooms, or from talking to 1 or 2 moms of multiples. Save money and borrow a copy if you have an hour or so to kill. That's about how long it will take to read."
5,Critical look at the reality of the Gospels and Epistles,"Excellent book. Doherty makes clear sense for anyone out there willing to give an honest look at the New Testament. This book argues that Jesus is a mythical figure. The book gives an indepth look at the complete lack of knowledge the Epistle writers had concerning a life ministry of Jesus. This book also gives somewhat a look at the hellenistic era culture and reveals the most-likely reasoning behind the early Christian writers, namely Mark and Paul. Also, it was quite interesting to learn about ""midrash"" and how it was obviously used to help fabricate the gospels and the epistles. There is much more in the book than can be summed up in this review, such as topics like; Josephus, Gospel of Thomas, and much more. Get the book. Also type the name Earl Doherty in a search engine and you should be able to locate his website to get a better idea of what his book is about."
3,Could have been better,"The author presents a lot of information that will educate the reader. Although I started reading as sympathetic to Doherty's thesis, I found much of the book highly speculative and unconvincing."
4,Indeed it makes you think,"The book is well written and every affirmation is addecuately referenced and justified. You can't say, however, that presents a definitive answer to the historicity of Jesus. It presents an innumerable quantity of valid propositions that, however, do not undoubtedly led you to think that Jesus didn't exist... although it could be a possibility.It is too a great source if you want to read a non-theology influenced book about Christianism."
4,Great Book,The author makes some really great points on why he believes the fundamental tenets of Christianity are based on a variety of false premises (this book is a good read for skeptics and people who think they are so sure about their faith). It was hard to put it down once I started reading. Although it would be great if the price was a little cheaper!
3,RVN Revisited,"I read the book because of a reference used in another book. The book is late 1970's with comments and observations from generals who served in Vietnam. Nothing extraordinary and most of the information we know from historical accounts.And, of the 58,000 US KIA...most would believe the war in Vietnam could of been avoided and to all those who lost their lives at places like Dak To, the SF border camps along the Laotian border..or hill fights in I Corps..we shall miss them all and hold them in our hearts.Lessons learned from Vietnam unfortunately may not be keystones of decisions in places like Korengal Valley or Takur Ghar/Paktia Province, Afghanistan."
3,Friendship and the Cultural Revolution,"Anchee Min's WILD GINGER is an intimate look at the friendship between two contrasting young girls growing amidst the drastic changes taking place in Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution.A story of friendship whose chains were destroyed by partisan beliefs, Maple and Wild Ginger wrestle between the principles of Maoism and the natural urges that bind them to the even more painful process of growing up. Disturbing and heartbreaking, the narrative may tend to wallow in predictable sentimentalism. But by the sheer power of the sociopolitical circumstances that test the love of these two girls for each other ... and the young man who came in between them, Anchee Min provides an insight into the China often discussed in history books but with greater pain from the eyes of the youngsters who lived through its most crucial period of cultural evolution."
4,pretty intense,"Extremely intense book and well written.At first, it seemed a bit extreme, but after talking to my family (we're Chinese), it was pretty sad to hear that the daily events mentioned in this book are true. My parents and their brothers/sisters experienced an extremely painful life in China.I rated this book a four because I feel like Anchee Min could have done a better job making transitions between chapters. Though it is like many Chinese movies when an underlying romantic situation occurs; a man and a woman could be enemies fighting each other one second and in the next, they are in love. You feel like you've missed something like how on earth their relationship evolved...Still a great book; I highly recommend this for everyone, especially high schoolers, who usually don't receive a detailed historical education of Asia during the communist years."
2,Sad reality of the cultural revolution,"Fast, easy page-turner (I read it in one day) that gives interesting insight into what it may have been like growing up during the Cultural Revolution. Although it is insightful and terribly sad at times, it was way too underdeveloped and never reached its full potential. I wish the writer had gone much more in depth with the charachters and their anguish, love, fear,lives,passions and ambitions.This was the first book I have read by this author and am curious about her other novels, only because of her positive reviews. However, this book wasn't a ""must-read"" at all- I would recommend it only if you have an interest in Maoist China and the Cultural Revolution, or a few spare hours to read an entire book."
3,Nice but not great,"I read Empress Orchid and loved it. That led me to the other books by this author. This was much lighter in content, but interesting. The characters were vivid and memorable. It was a good book, but not to the standard of Empress Orchard."
2,A Mediocre Game,"Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries is a mediocre game. Basically there are seven different cultures such as: The Greeks, The Zulu, and The Persians. They each have different qualities and you have the choice of a diplomatic victory or a military victory. I disliked this game because of the interface. It made it difficult to play because structures had to be within a certain range of another structure in order for it to operate correctly. Also, trading (which is the easiest way to get money) was difficult and awkward. Overall, I would recommend, if you like strategy games that you try one the Age of Empires series. Because Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries is not worth your time."
1,YAWN ... Wake Me When It's Over,"If you have trouble sleeping, this book is for YOU! The author rehashes the same facts of the crime over and over as if he was chewing on a tough steak. I never got a sense that I knew or even cared about the people involved and that includes Bergna, the victim, either family, their friends, the police officers or the attorneys. It was as dry as reading a deposition. And this is the first true crime book I've read in my entire 20+ years of being a devoted true crime fan in which, after finishing the book, I'm still not convinced the accused did it! The only thing that kept me plodding through it was the hope that nestled somewhere inside its sleepy pages was a sensational blockbuster that would blow the lid off the whole case and cause me to bolt upright in my armchair. Sadly, that moment never came and the book ended with more of a whimper than an explosion. My only regret (other than buying it) is that it's impossible for me to give it less than a one star rating."
2,Looks better in a picture,So disappointing. I should have listened to the previous review that it is not good quality because it isn't. It is actually about to come down. It un-peels from the wall continuously.
1,Cute but does not stick,This border did not go on well and did not stick once we got it up. We have used York borders in the past and they work much better!!!
1,sad face,mmaaannnn i was to blue wen i hooked it up.. the purpose for my buyin the product was completely defeated.. i bought this item cause my dash lights nor counsel lights work at night.. its supposed to be a brand new item an it fails me.. bunch of ballony if u ask me
5,Break - Away Collars are not just for Cats,"I always keep these collars on my dogs while they are home. It allows them to be consistently used to wearing a collar, provides at least a chance of identification if they escape, and prevents the horrific accidents too few dog owners have heard of where dogs get caught on something and get injured or worse, including two dogs playing. I know of dogs who have stuck their heads into another dog's collar while playing and suffocated. If I have to secure the two rings together and add a leash, that can be done easily, but I don't generally use the collar as my only on leash accessory, preferring the safety of a harness."
5,Nice for the price!,"This MP3 player is very nice for the price. It has 128 megs of storage, (which will hold up to four hours of pretty good quality music). It is very compact and light weight, so it will be easy to stick into your pocket or purse and go anywhere. The voice recorder/memo feature is also a plus.While serious music fans will want a player with more memory, this is a nice first MP3 player for a teen, or an adult for that matter.This MP3 player includes the earbuds, USB connector, Driver CD, and battery.I purchased this as a gift for someone, and she absolutely loved it!"
4,Useful for international schools,"I have been using this for a few years with international schools as an intro to 9/10th grade exam work. It has sensible chapters: tension, language, focus. It is not eurocentric. Refences to paintings are novel. Play excerpts are appropriate. The activities fit well. It is fairly free of jargon. Some dismiss it. I do not."
5,"Great voice, great CD","Joan Baez, apart from having a lovely voice, also has good taste in what music she chooses to sing: not only does she sample the Beatles' ""Eleanor Rigby"" and Simon and Garfunkel's ""Dangling Conversation,"" she also comes through with many beautiful, original melodies.This CD is worth buying simply for the song, ""Children of Darkness."" I heard this tune and instantly fell in love with it: Joan's voice fits the feel of the song perfectly, and the instrumental backround is simply fantastic."
1,Don't buy it,"It costs that little for a reason. The construction is weak. I bought it expecting structured Velcro that would keep the toes in place but the main part of the toe trainers is made out of some foamy material that stretches out a lot and doesn't hold shape because of it. Therefore, it does not hold anything in place. Good idea but bad product."
4,Its a perfect carry along toy.,Its a pillow its a toy its a blanket perfect when space is limited. The zip off blanket makes it easy to clean. It's fairly easy to get back in the proper shape after its been unrolled.
3,Ok item,"This is my first time cloth diapering and I ordered a swaddlebee laundry bag as well as 2 bummis waterproof bags. What I don't like about them is that even though I wash them with the actual diapers, the smell doesn't seem to come out all the way, plus you can't dry them.The swaddlebee's does not smell after laundering and it can be dried in the dryer. Next time I'd stick with the swaddlebee's."
4,~A Man Like No Other~,The video goes behind Sam Waltons Success in retailing. It talks about his early days and how he even got into retailing and where his retailer is today.
5,Great book on Religion!,"Dr. Gross was my Comparative Religion professor at Western Michigan University in 1990 or 1991. I have to say, even though I was a Business major and I took the class as an elective, it was my absolute favorite class of my entire college career. I learned so much, I learned how to be more accepting of non-Christians BUT I also grew in my own Christian beliefs.We studied his book ""Searching for God"" during the class.This man had an amazing life story, and has created probably one of the best religion-based books I've ever read.I still have my copy from the early 90's. It's one of only about 3 ""textbooks"" I have kept over the last 18 years."
1,"Quality significantly less than Connick, Jr.!","Once you listen to this CD, you will realize that Harry Connick, JR. got his looks from his father, but the voice must be from his mother. Sr.'s voice is flat and has no range. Would have sounded better if recorded in the shower"
1,There are errors in this book.,"The book seemed intriguing at first. However, on page 44 there is a very, very trouble mathematical error regarding the number ""e"" and logarithms. Namely, the author states that if y=e^x then x=log(y) (it should be x=ln(y)) which is so completely wrong that I stopped reading it. Well, I then decided that since I paid for the book, I should try again. I e-mailed the author about the error I found but he sent me a nonsensical response. I wonder about his credibility now. I wouldn't buy this book, not after such the author got such a basic math principle wrong."
2,"A rambling, long winded book that never makes a point succinctly. 2.5 stars.","The Prime Number Theorem and its related consequences is a fascinating subject. This book however is a long winded, very poorly written attempt. The author never seems to be able to make a point clearly and succinctly. Instead we are treated to a ramble that confuses more than elaborates. For example the presentation on functions is very poorly done. I have seen basic algebra texts explain the idea of functions far better than in this book. To make matters worse the author takes about ten pages to explain the beautiful idea of a function thus killing a sublime truth.Sorry to say but far better general math books abound. Take a look at Journey Through Genius."
5,Excellent Reading for Math and Non-Math Types,"Mr. Derbyshire has written an absolutely excellent book on the Riemann hypothesis. The Riemann hypothesis, which relates to prime and complex numbers, has yet to be proved. It is the most famous unproved problem in mathematics. In fact, the first person to prove the Riemann hypothesis will be awarded a large sum of money from the Clay Mathematics Institute.Mr. Derbyshire's book is perfect for folks like me with a mathematics background and also for those who lack formal training but are interested nonetheless. The mathematics are very well explained, and much of the book requires no understanding of mathematics at all. ""Prime Obsession"" is easily the most accessible book ever written on the Riemann hypothesis.Pure mathematics is more of a mysterious art than a science, and this work serves to illuminate one very important mathematical mystery. This book is on my shelf, and it should be on yours too!"
2,"Good hardware, bad terminology and VHDL syntax","I wanted to rate this book a 5 and recommend it in our VHDL classes, however, due to its numerous errors in basic understanding of VHDL, I could not.Hardware design wise, this book has numerous great examples that will help you understand how to apply VHDL.Numerous (and far too many) pages have errors on them.For example, the book claims the 'U' in std_ulogic stands for unresolved and that std_logic does not have a 'U'. In IEEE 1076-2008 (and previously in IEEE 1164 (std_logic_1164), the 'U' is defined to mean undriven and both std_ulogic and std_logic have the same 9 values.Terminology about many statements is not consistent with how VHDL defines the terminology. If used in a classroom, this type of stuff is easy to correct, however, if you are reading this book to learn VHDL, I would recommend you supplement it with a language book such as Bhasker's or Ashenden's."
5,Introduction to Designing with VHDL,"This is my first VHDL book and it is very useful. I need VHDL for design and this book covers many design issues. For example, in the variables topic, implementation with both signal and variable are given and their flip flop requirements are compared.Also common errors are explained and simulations results are given to demonstrate them. There are many examples in the book and they are well used to clarify the issues."
5,Excellent Book!,"This is the best book I have seen about the subject. It is clear, well organised and filled with useful examples."
5,Excellent book,"Thank you! the shipping was fast, and I could use my book the day that I needed. The book was in excellent conditions."
5,VHDL: Great book,I've purchased this book for my PHD research and I find it very interesting for VHDL beginners.Nes
4,Circuit design with VHDL made easy,"This concise and interesting book provides a detailed approach to FPGA-based digital circuit and system design using VHDL. It presents the basic concepts in organized and progressive phases. The textbook covers the constructs of the VHDL programming language with a large number of implementable examples. A multitude of complete illustrative examples are also included.The second part of the book discusses other important features of the design aspects using VHDL such as components, functions, and procedures. The book is intended for computer and electrical engineering students and practicing engineers. See alsoDigital Electronics and Design with VHDL"
5,Excellent,"Great book for beginner. I'd special like the session of chapter 12.4-Digital filter, 12.5 neural-network. and 12.6 problem (solution example). Well, it would be better if the author add on ""wavelet"" section in the next edition."
2,Schrodt Hummingbird feeder,This is the best purchase I have made in a long time. The feeder is great and so easy to maintain. If you notify Schrodt they sell the brush to clean the feeder and they take mail orders. I love this feeder and I can see that my hummies are enjoying it also. I highly recommend this even though it is more money than some of the others out there. It has a rich finish and the wood is good quality. Looking to buy another one.
1,REs Die in feeder Dangerous to Birds,I ve read that the red dies used in hummingbird feeder's kill the animal through asphixiation of throat. Purchase ones without the red dye.
1,Vienna Boys' Choir,"Sorry folks, this VHS tape came in scramble. I can hear the music, but can't see NOTHING on it. I only see all the dash lines on the screen and the music got scramble also.It does not worth much for me to send it back to the sender. So, I have no way of reviewing this tape."
5,Will Kit Great Buy,"I purchased this will kit after viewing several, and I was pleased with this purchase. There was an example for me to follow. There were 2 kits one for the husband, and one for the wife. I was able to share mine with my sister as we were both single. Very easy to follow.I even called the company for advice regarding certain questions. The rep was very helpful.....Great buy for the money...."
3,Incorrect E-Mail Sent to Me,"I was sent an email Oct. 12th and notified that my item was being returned because of an incorrect address, so I ordered another one to be sent to the correct address, as a result my sister received two books and I am charged double. Now what do I do? I would like a refund of one of my orders since I was told it was being returned."
2,This 1967 Recording Does Not Age Well,"I like and admire John Fahey's guitar playing, but the found noise or musique concrete or whatever you want to call it that drowns out a good portion of this recording is unlistenable. When I heard the first such slogged-up cut, I thought, 'oh alright, I can get through this' -- but then there were three more, comprising about half the record. Who can listen to this? I want guitar playing, not failed musical experimentation at my expense."
3,Them with a Panther Girl,"50's movies were obsessed with the idea of overblown insects and scientists. This serial used the idea and put them in Africa with a panther girl. A scientist and his two helpers discover that the diamond mine in the village has started producing again. To drive away the people they decide the best device is scare them off with huge claw monsters. Not if the Panther Girl (Phyllis Coates, the first Lois Lane) can help it. She does the impossible -wrestles alligators and saves the village. It's long (almost three hours) but fun."
2,"Haven't seen it, but here's a plug for ""Tarzan""","I haven't seen this film, but I have a feeling that ""Tarzan And His Mate"" will be better. Maureen O'Sullivan plays a very good ""Jane"" and even shows a bit of skin in ""Tarzan And His Mate"" and that really counts for something for such an old movie!"
3,Great...Until the climax,"""More Than You Know"" starts out well, and procedes beautifully and suspensfully until the very end. the last chapter is just one big mess.**Warning-Spoilers**the big reveal of who the rapist is is a total flop. who is this guy? we have no idea. and did Jack rape Dennie or not? I feel that is an important detail that is totally left out. and why is there no closure on Dennie'e psychological issues? I actually found myself turning over the last page expecting more to come.**End spoilers**apart from my issues, I was impressed with the obvious rsearch Ms. Kellman did on the psychology of rape and rap victims. I jnow quite a bit about the subject and sh is spot on."
2,Antenna corrodes,"I have had the sportster replay installed in my explorer for about 7 months now, and a few weeks ago I had problems with my antenna. I kept getting antenna not detected errors, however sometimes the signal would come through very weakly. After checking the antenna I found that the plastic piece that connects to the magnetic antenna was very corroded. When I picked it up and played with it a little bit, pieces of the plastic began to flake off. It was pretty obvious that the connection wasn't going to be working properly like that. Sirius recommends that this antenna be installed on the roof of your car, it's even highly magnetized so it won't be blown off. It should be weatherproofed better."
2,Same problem here..........,"I installed this system for a good cutomer of mine and experienced the same problem. After only several months the ""antenna not detected"" started up. Went with a Shakespear marine unit since it was going on the roof of an RV. I think they should supply the cradle and mount and let the customers choose whatever antenna their installation requires. I tried to mount the original antenna on the inside of the windshield with a suction mount I found. But with Sirius units the antenna really should be on the roof and the original antenna just can't take it."
1,what a piece of crap !,"Lets see, SUCTION mount does not hold on days that are too hot, too cold, too humid, too dry etc..(get the point ?) Plastic cradle corrodes and breaks. CHEAP magnetic antenna does not work worth a damn. Wire from antenna breaks after a couple months. And the best part of all, Sirius does NOT carry parts and you have to buy a NEW receiver and then go through customer service (and ""hold"" and ""Hello"" my name is ""Bob""/Sanjay"" etc) to get old receiver deleted and new receiver up and running...Sirius has made a few bucks and now they don't give a damn. Heck just listen to Stern. He and Robin GOT PAID and now just ""phone it in""....They are boring..."
2,dvd review,Good song material but lighting not adequate for most of the songs. I would look further for videos of this important artist.
5,Advanced Ab workout,"I'm a exercise DVD junkie. Mostly, I do Cathe, Turbo Jam, & David Swenson yoga along with gym workouts, running, and hiking.I have P90X abs (love it),Cathe's Core Max (great), but this surpasses them both in my opinion. It's not a high tech set and does have repetions galore. I love it because it works. Caron's husband is a champion triathlete. She also is a triathlete & yoga instructor. The DVD is geared towards athletes. Fantastic!"
2,Basic history overview with even more basic plans,"I enjoyed the first section of the book with a nice historical overview of clocks. From there it was disappointing. If you are a complete beginner with no creativity you may find this helpful, but as an intermediate woodworker I felt most of these could be re-created from a simple photo without a need for critical dimensions. As well, most of these ""clock"" plans were simple wood sculptures...with a hole for a $10 clock insert. I think there is only one tall clock in the book and one Shaker style wall clock. If you're a complete beginner, take a look. If you're looking for more ideas to improve your basic or intermediate skills, keep looking."
3,Not happy,"If your looking for clock case plans you may like this book. If your looking for plans to build a wooden clock movement, this isn't the book. I feel the title is misleading,"
4,informative,Instructions are comprehensive and presented in logical sequence. Makes it possible to actually create your own clock.
1,Disappointed with small print of solos,"The book has good selections, but the solos are only shown above the piano accompaniment, and not supplied separately - which was confusing, because the Table of Contents indicates page numbers [4-112] for the ""piano"" (which refer to the accompaniments with the [small print] solo line above, and also page numbers [116-156] for the ""instrument"", which I expected to be the solo parts alone... but the book's page numbers stop with the ""piano"" pages..."
5,This book is wonderful for those who love Beethoven.,This book is for those of us who want to hear the classics.. first hand. or for those of us that like MIDI sequencing or music study. Whatever the reason..I suggest this book all the way.
4,At this price it can't be beat,"I agree with a previous reviewer that these are not good for conducting work. These scores are reprints that lack the precision, clarity and readability of the Baerenreiter scores, which are based on recent scholarship. However, just for casual listening and studying purposes, they do fine and are much more affordable than Baerenreiter."
2,Avoid it if you're serious,"Not at all, as another reviewer called it, a ""must-have"" for conductors or serious students of the work. It's fairly poorly printed (messy and cramped in places, and sort of fuzzy and blurred all the way through), although the size is nice. More importantly for a conductor, it's hard to read and lacks rehearsal markings of any sort. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for. Don't buy this if you need to conduct out of it - I kept a library copy of the Barenreiter under my stand the whole time while rehearsing the Fifth, and had to pull it out every time I stopped."
3,Too Small,"It does a great job of getting most of the litter off the cats' feet, when they actually use it. The problem with the size of it, is that no matter how you place it, they always find a way to jump over it. It does clean up easy, though."
5,Amazing low light camera,I bought this webcam to be used with my telescope for taking images of the planets and the moon. With a 6 inch telescope stars as faint as 12th magnitude can be seen (that is very faint) with this camera. In order to do better I would have to spend $1000 or more.
5,This Webcam is great i love it,i got this webcam in the last month and have not been let down yet it works great in the dark and it has it's own mic that pics up sound great so it your looking for a all around webcam this is it i tell you picture is clear and smooth i am happy i bought it the 60FPS is nice and it has a program that follows your face if you move in a chair or in a room it will try to stay on your face niceDan
4,"Good Webcam, with one minor issue so far","This webcam is very good, everybody says they can see me pretty well, comparing to my other 6yo free camera that I had, it also captures the sound very good too. The picture in dim light conditions is pretty fair too!The only issue I have: I cannot attach it to my monitor - the clamp provided is for LCD and I have CRT so far, I will upgrade soon, then I should be just fine. So far I stick the camera into a pencil holder - silly, but it works.Otherwise I would give it a 5 star rating."
1,Incredibly poor stand/clip design,"I bought the SPC900NC based on several technical recommendations. But the design of the stand/clip is juvenile, hopeless, and just astoundingly poor. It will not stay on the lip of a laptop monitor. It is too flimsy to set in one position and expect it to stay there--even the tripod mount screw location is obscured by the clip. My theory is that if Phillips is satisfied to release this product with poor design build into a plastic housing, Heaven knows what kind of design resides in the electronics and software we will be dealing with. Mine was returned promptly."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this item based on recommendations from the Skype tech department. According to Skype, this webcam would be compatible with Mac OS. After purchasing this product, along with a reasonable $8 charge for shipping, I received the webcam with an unexpected $30 charge for shipping from Beach Audio (apparently due to the fact that I live in Hawaii, which was not made clear on the order form.) I had problems installing the software for this product. Phone calls to Phillips tech department revealed the webcam to be incompatible with Mac OS. By the time I get my refund back, which has yet to happen, I will have incurred almost $50 in expenses for shipping and restocking charges and am still without a webcam."
1,Not Mac Compatible,"MACINTOSH USERS PLEASE READ AND SAVE YOURSELF ALOT OF TROUBLE!! This neat little camera has a great look and I bet it works really well. The problem is i COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK even with downloading the MACAM driver. I took it to a professional Mac place and they said it would take them so long to install it on my mac (and expensive) that I should just buy this neat little cam they have in stock for their Mac users called iMage which is what I did and here is what happened:I got home, turned on my computer, signed into Yahoo messenger, and then SIMPLY PLUGGED THIS LITTLE CAM CALLED iMAGE IN AND IT WORKS! Immediately an picture comes up and when you're done you just unplug it! Mac Users please look for iMAGE cam and don't waste your time buying anything else and having to return them. Even the Apple store doesn't sell cameras anymore, besides the one they offered was over 200.00, even on ebay! Good luck!"
1,Never received this product.,"I ordered this product back on 1/8/06, but still haven't received it. Please look into this. Thank you-Regina Snipp"
5,well loved puzzle,"My 5 year old loves this puzzle. It's a bit challenging, but it's one of her favorites. Very cute."
1,Waste of Time,"A book total void of academic content. As a collector of books, I would never support the burning of a book, but the ""arguements"" in this one give me pause to reconsider that position. Do not waste your money, even if you are an atheist willing to challenge your ""beliefs."" Read instead The Swerve by Stephen Greenblatt."
2,problem with tuner but nice set otherwise,"This set has a very nice picture, as others have noted viewsonic does not subscribe to the universal remote codes so my other remotes dont recognize the tv, you will have to purchase a universal remote with learning function to solve this problem.A bigger problem is turning this tv off while using the on-board tuner to view an HD channel. Once you try and turn the tv back on you get nothing and have to perform several steps which will take about 1-2 minutes on the clock to make it work.Customer support first claimed they sort of knew of the problem, then denied it and do not return calls despite saying they will.I have had several viewsonic monitors before but this TV is a disappointment.On the other hand if you dont plan to use the on board tuner you will be happy with the picture quality."
1,Don't BUY ANYTHING from ViewSonic,"These people cannot support or stand behind their product. They may be the worst ever. My sound (main board) went out in month 15 (just 3 months out of warranty). Customer support can't tell you anything other than to check the yellow pages. Well, after 10 local contacts with HD TV repair shops the truth is self-evident. None of these guys would even try to fix the problem. They won't do business with ViewSonic. Oh, and don't even try to get help directly from ViewSonic or their parts departement. They won't help you diagnose the problem and they won't let you return a part, even if you can convince them to sell you one, which is no easy task. They would NOT tell me about the warranty service centers. They won't let me send it there to get repaired EVEN if I want to pay for the repair. So, yeah, it looks great in the showroom, but your out of luck if ANYTHING goes wrong. The problem with no support for universal remote codes is just icing on the cake."
3,half the job,"its a nice set and decent price. has quite a bit of inputs and options but here are some of its deficiencies:1. switching from catv to over the air antenna takes over 5 buttons on the remote.2. also, when you do get hdmi to use the pip option, it again takes over 5 buttons to either swap or turn it off.3. i have yet to figure out how to change channels in over the air. there is no button for ""."" or ""-"" to get to 7.1 for example.well there are other quirks but these are the main ones causing me to only give it 3 stars"
1,painfully saccharine,"If you a Mr. Rogers fan, hoping to enjoy his work (as I was) be warned: his simple meaningful and heartfelt tunes have been mangled into over-produced pop-sugar sentimentality, each artist ""making it their own"" to such a degree that the singable tunes Rogers created are all but unrecognizable. A *major* disappointment."
2,"Decent, but not great","When I bought this I had thought that Mr. Rogers would be singing on some or all of the disk alongside the other performers. I was in fact looking for a CD with him singing, and not as interested in what this CD turned out to be. It includes various singers doing their own interpretations of his songs. I found the interpretations to be hit or miss, but sadly, more miss for me. I would have rather just listed to Mr. Rogers sing them. Still, if you really like Mr. Rogers songs, this might appeal to you, but for me the songs were too improvised and jazzed up to rekindle my love of his songs."
2,Not true to the songs.,"This album drips with all the sappy cliches, uninspired performances, and canned accompaniments that make the ""Adult Contemporary Pop"" genre an abolition to the word MUSIC. Fred Rogers created a truely unique childrens program- What other program is filled with enough content to capture an audience's attraction without the use of fantastic color animations, overly excited reactions, or unintelligent humor? The original music to compliment the program fit into that vein perfectly- Jazz. But not just any kind of jazz- ""folk jazz,"" to coin a genre. It was intelligent music of and for the people. It was music that subtly sent the message that there is music in each of us. If you have any affinity for the music of Mr. Rogers, pick up the original recordings- they ARE available. This tribute album is not true to the message that Mr. Rogers preached all his life."
1,Somethings shouldn't be changed,"This CD is awful. Mr. Rogers music even when ""upbeat"" by his standards was calming for children. This is not. If the children are watching Mister Rogers on TV and expect to hear the songs as played on the videos, do NOT buy this album. It is nothing like what they have come to know & love."
3,Okay workout,This workout is just okay...It's pretty loose with the instruction but you still get a good arm workout out of it. I use it every once in awhile...
2,Overkill.,The reading and circling and re-reading and underlining and re-re-reading and making triangles is a little much. Okay I get it already. Sorry. Maybe this approach works for other people. We tried this as a Small Group Bible Study and were BORED TO TEARS!
4,Great vintage scent for a great price.,"This is a great scent - I wear it every day. Very vintage and cool, very refined and sophisticated. The one reason why I can't give this product the full five stars is because it wears off fairly quickly - I have to apply it heavily all over to ensure it lasts all day. If you're looking for a ""different"" smelling citrusy fragrance, this is the one for you."
1,not so nice,I purchased those blocks based on what seemed like impeccable reviews. When they arrived you could easily see through the box that there are quality issues with the blocks. There is a decent amount of color transfer between blocks with red and green paint splotches on the yellow blocks. Some edges of blocks look uneven and so the paint applied in those places in likely to chip off. Looks like it began to chip of on a few pieces. I also found some broken chips on the bottom of the box and those don't even look like they came from the blocks. Clearly some low quality issues and those are definitely going back. You will also not find where they have been manufactured anywhere on the package. Overall very disappointed!
4,Just the right size - one small problem,I needed a small gas tank for our 4 hp outboard for the canoe. This little tank filled the bill and arrived as scheduled. One small problem though. There is a fitting attached to the top of the tank where the quick connect for the gas hose is screwed in. The female horizontal threads where the quick connect screws in is very close to the top of the tank. There is not enough clearance for the OMC connector to screw in so the fitting has to be loosened to give clearance. There is one of the screws under where the quick connect screws into the tank fitting. It was kind of awkward but I got it installed and tightened down. If the tank fitting was oriented differently or was half an inch taller it would be nice. I checked to see if the fitting could be turned 90 degrees which may give more room for the installation of the quick connect fitting but the screws that attach the hose fitting to the tank are NOT the same dimensions in both directions.
5,Moeller Scepter Topside Marine Fuel Tank with Gauge (3.2-Gallon,Received gas tank well packaged in good time and had absolutely no problems. Transaction was very smooth and I enjoy buying on Amazon due the the fact that many items are better priced than stuff on ebay and I haven't so far had any issues of items being misrepresented in their descriptions but have a number of times on ebay. Keep up the good work!
2,OK item if you plan to spemd extra money....,"Bought this to use with my 9HP Force engine. Right out of the box I had to go back to the store and get replacement parts. The fuel line was chocked when packaged at the factory and in time developed a kink that made leak as soon as I put fuel through it. I contacted the manufacturer several times for the warranty and after 6 months I still have to hear back from them.All in all, an extremely poor product with even worse customer service after you waste your money on it.The tank is OK but if you have a chance to buy something else, go for the service rather than cheap price...I would not recommend this company to my enemies much less my friends..."
3,King in Prussia,Somehow this did not read as easily as his other works. I knew very little about the origin of Prussia and so enjoyed the book very much.
1,Will Not Work with USB TIP,"One issue that I have found is that the USB tip (USB1 or USB1B) cannot be used with the this ""dual charging cable"" (P/N 38013),The USB tip has a key that will not work with the splitter. I was told specifically by a Kensington technical representative that this was by design! And if I wanted to power my cell phone, ipod, etc... I would have to buy the specific TIP and not use the USB adapter."
2,laptop must draw current before other device charges,"Not so happy. Ordered one of these and plugged by PDA which did not charge.Turns out that it only charges when the larger item is drawing current. So it will only charge the phone/pda etc IF the laptop is drawing current. This is very annoying when the laptop is shut down with a full battery since it draws no current, thus the phone/pda do not charge."
1,I feel ripped off,"This came as part of a ""packaged"" deal from Kensington and was represented as a universal adapter. NOT!!! It would not fit any of our USB gadgets and was a total waste of money."
2,"""B"" adapter tips don't seem to be usable with this dual cable","I bought the ultraportable Kensington auto/air/wall charger at the same time as I bought this dual charging cable. None of the tips that come with the auto/air charger -- all of which are the ""B"" variations -- will fit on this dual cable, apparently by design. Same for the ""winder"" extension cable. I'm not sure if buying the non-""B"" tips would solve the problem."
2,close to worthless,It won't charge my iPod or my eBook at all. It is worthless except to charge my laptop and cellphone at the same time.
2,it died,"Worked for what I wanted <ventrillo> for a week or so, then started getting a lot of static and noise with my mic.Found a different solution to my problem."
1,You get what you pay for,"Pro: CheapCon: Sounds like audio from a super cheap usb sound card.I've used usb sound devices in the past that weren't too much more expensive than this one, and they actually sounded good. I listened to 3 songs on this bad boy and pulled it out of my computer. I'll keep it around just in case my mic jack ever goes out, but most likely it will sit in my closet and collect dust until I throw it away."
1,Dont buy from them unless you live by Hong Kong!,"Did not realize they were located in Hong Kong! Order was lost, but refunded my $! It was a cheap price, but way to far from me lol"
1,It didn't work,I bought this item and it did not work at all. I would not recommend this item for anyone to buy at all I gave it 1 star but really I give it no stars at all.
1,Warning,I bought one of these a few months ago and within' a few minutes of using it the ear buds on my headphones felt like they were burning! The next day my USB port died.I'd say save your money!
1,worked for 2 minutes,"When I plugged in the earphones they worked find, but when I added the microphone, nothing worked and only static was produced. Then static was all I could get with or without the microphone attached."
1,Reversed stereo channels,"I bought this little device because the headphone jack on my PC case broke. I wasn't expecting 7.1 DTS quality audio for $3 but I WAS expecting them to get stereo right. It's built very flimsily (sp?)and feels like it's going to break any time you plug it in or out of the computer. Okay, again, $3. No soldering problems on mine. I use headphones mainly for gaming and noticed the stereo channels were reversed. On further testing, the Windows sound test produces audio in the left ear when testing the right channel and vice versa. I used the new Apple ear buds that are form fit for each ear - and yes, I tried two different pair of different style headphones. This wouldn't be a problem if you are using symmetric style headphones but makes non-symmetric ear buds virtually useless for gaming. Someone failed soldering class in China."
1,probably not worth the low price,"I got two of these, almost for free, through Amazon; neither audiooutput would work on my home Gateway laptop or e-Machines netbook;only one would work with either of my work Dell systems (one laptop,one tower). All running Win XP; mostly I got ""USB device attachedhas malfunctioned; Windows does not recognize this USB device."" Pricewas low enough that it didn't seem worth returning them to Amazon,but YMMV. Let the buyer beware.I did not try mic input on either one on any of the four systems.Am making christmas tree ornaments out of them as a perpetualwarning. People who like large, dangle-y earrings and this shadeof blue might consider that as well."
2,Mic didn't work for me,"I use mine for online FPS gaming on a headset, including voice comms. The sound quality was OK. I don't need much for gaming -- as long as it's clear and no significant distortion I'm good.Unfortunately when I went to set up my mic all I got was a constant staticky noise on the ""Test Microphone"" setting (TF2). Adjusting the mic volume didn't affect it at all.It's possible it's interacting with my other sound card (Turtle Beach Santa Cruz). I use that card for other purposes, I don't want to disable or remove it, and other USB sound cards I've tried don't have this problem. Other uses I might have for it also require it coexisting with other sound cards.For my purposes it's useless. Fortunately I didn't pay much for it."
2,Not so great!,"It arrived fast and its easy to use, (just plug it in), but the quality is HORRIBLE. While it amplifies the sound really nicely, ALL clarity is gone, I couldnt even hear my music through the static. I've ordered other sound cards on Amazon for just a few cents more, you should too."
2,Lousy product,"I bought this unit and it was dead on arrival. The company was real good and prompt and sent me out another. It too was dead and would not work. I decided that it wasn't worth the effort to get another and it probably wouldnt work as well. I bought a different brand and I hope this one will work. Company was great to deal with, but the product was worthless."
4,It works for me.,"After upgrading a Dell Dimension 8250 with windows 7, I was hit with the common problem of the original Creative Labs sound card turning its little feet in the air. I took out the old sound card, and the modem as a matter of fact, plugged this into a USB 2.0 port, rebooted and I was in business. I will use this until I decide on a more permanent solution, but as for now it works fairly well. I think that some folks who have problems installing stuff like this might fail to remove the old hardware, or in the case of onboard stuff, disable it."
4,external USB 5.1 3D sound card,"You plug it in and it works. Sound is OK (sometimes a slight buzz). Definitely worth the money paid. I have several of these and use them when I need an extra sound card for mixing music (use it as a monitor channel) and also keep a few with headphone/mic plugged in so I am ready to video conference or skype by just plugging one in, or if I want to listen to a movie or music in private. Much easier to plug something into the USB port than trying to determine which plug goes into which audio jack on my notebook. No 3D software (does not use the cMedia chipset) so I cannot comment on whether that feature works or not. My feeling is that it does not compared to my cMedia based ones that come with XEar software (which will not run on this card) but then again, this is a Chinese knockoff at a cheaper price."
1,Terrible,I used this adaptor for less than a month and the housing broke off. The device also stopped working (stopped producing sound) right after it broke.
1,rubbish,The item did not work; but to the vendor's credit it was immediately replaced.The replacement stopped wording after a few times as well.
2,"Poor quality, but easy to use.","I plugged this into my laptop and it worked immediately. Very easy to use. However, the first thing I noticed was a constant busing sound when plugging in headphones, and the sound quality is poor. Also, this stopped working after about 3 months.If you need cheap temporary sound this would be great. If you want to use this regularly buy something of better quality."
4,Virtual 5.1 USB Adapter,"Good product. Does what we required. Takes a while for the product to arrive from Hong Kong, but it did arrive within the stated time frame."
3,usb sound card,"I accidentally hit my headphones where they go into the laptop slot, and broke off. that tip is stuck in there so i couldn't use head phones. i bought this to see if it would allow me to use my head phones, and it works fine. for 2 dollars it solves my problem. It doesn't have much volume, but for 2 dollars, it works and it is fine. Shipping was quick too :)"
2,"Absolutely awful sound quality, but it works otherwise.","What the title says--I was planning to use this to practice live sound production, but couldn't because everything that used the channel the sound card provided came out sounding horrible. But I could still hear stuff and it hasn't fallen apart or anything yet, so I think it deserves 2 stars. You should almost certainly buy something else."
2,works more or less...,"I bought two of them, they install without drivers just perfect on xp, vista, 7, and 8. I don't have a mac to try them on. They give you output and input. Despite '7.1' they just have stereo for output (maybe they can retask the output jack as spid/if? Dunno). However the audio was a bit rough sounding on both of them. At higher volume levels they got static and rumble. This can be mitigated by using amplified speakers and keeping system volumes low. Otoh, the mic input is mono only, and was very noisy. Would be ok for voice chat, but not much else."
1,Disappointed,"I guess I received a dud. It didn't work from the get go. I tried it on 3 different PC's. I looked on the seller's site for help, but didn't find any. Windows reports that the device has malfunctioned and windows will not recognize the device. Windows reports error code 43. I tried to update the driver, but windows says the best driver is already installed. I used the IT support at work to help me diagnose and trouble shoot this device and they drew the same conclusion that I already had.I would like to see more technical description of PC and / or operating system requirements needed to support this device before purchasing."
3,"Headphone Jack Works, Microphone Jack Doesn't Work","The Headphone Jack works fine, but my headset microphone isn't powered, so it didn't work. It seems that you need a self-powered microphone in order for the Microphone Jack to work."
1,I would rate 0 stars if I could,"Think its too good to be true? well it is, dosent work on my windows XP PC, drivers included on USB drive are no help at all, at least it was cheap, but a complete waste of money. Seller sent me product only, no box, no CD w/ software, no instrucions..."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS SOOO NOT WELL BUILT!",I GOT THIS AND IT FELT REALLLY LOOSE AND STUFF AND IT DIDNT WORK! ITS A VERY UNRELIABLE PRODUCT. OH AND THE VOLUME IS SUPER LOUD ON IT EVEN IF YOUR COMPUTER VOLUME IS LOW.
2,Generic Drivers Don't Work in Windows 7,"I plugged in the sound card to my laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate, and the drivers automatically installed. Once completed, I checked the Devices/Printers to see what it showed as, and was greeted with 'Unknown Device'.Tried to find newer drivers with no luck. It wouldn't function within any of my applications, so I'm sending it back to Amazon.The old adage, 'you get what you pay for' applies here."
2,Doesn't Work for Windows 7,"This product's price was very reasonable but it doesn't work for all laptops. I received this USB Sound Adapter and discovered that it doesn't work for Windows 7. This should defiantly be included in the product description. I didn't have an issue returning the product to the sender, however, which is a plus for the seller."
1,Not quality.,"I purchased two for cleaner sound outputting from my laptop and desktop. One was defective right out of the box, the other shorted and failed after about 3 weeks of use. Disappointing."
1,Garbage.,"The unit actually heats up my headphones to the point of me not being able to put them in my ears. Completely self-defeating. At least it was only $1, but it's still a dollar wasted.Get a similar unit from Syba or shell out $12 for a Logitech, because this thing is pure garbage."
1,Junk,"I bought this from a local computer store.Despite gentle use, the case fell apart, so I used it with out one, till the POS fried itself."
3,really cheap at the time but they work,at the time I had purchased this device for under a dollar. It will get sound out to headphones but I have never tried 5.1 surround sound. The sound quality was normal and nothing remarkable to write home about. All and all though for the price and the fact that it was not DOA I am happy with the product as a basic USB sound card.
3,not work as I expected,"It does work, but not as I expected. I purchased this for my hp n40l micro server, which doesn't have a sound card. I found that if I just plug this usb device in without the speaker. The audio device doesn't show up. If I plug the speaker to it, the audio device shows up and works properly. However, I found if I login remotely from remote desktop, this doesn't work. Since I access my server mostly from remote session, this is not gonna work for me."
2,worthless,"This thing is worthless. Go and spend a few extra bucks on a different one...any other one. Maybe mine was just bad, but it was $$$. I can't imagine the quality being much more than what I experienced."
3,Flimsy construction,Needed an adapter for laptop. I was happy with the first one I bought but it was lost so I got cheap and decided to try this one. Never again. Should have spent the couple of extra dollars. Flimsy construction.
1,Cheap and crappy,Only used it on a Mac to enable regular headset use. Not impressed. The speaker volume blasts out at max and doesn't want to adjust.
1,It broke,Damn think broke. Also it doesnt allow you to adjust the volume so I was bleeding out of my ears. A lawsuit is in order.
2,Eh...,"The thing works on the PC, but the construction is incredibly shoddy. If you simply touch it, the case may break apart. The sound quality would be fair if it weren't for this strange oscillating noise/static. I did not try the mic, but according to other reviews, it seems awful. It is exactly what one would expect from a product that costs a quarter. Also, beware to users who are buying this to use with the PS3 slim; it may not work."
1,An affordable piece of garbage,"I bought one of these and I can tell you unequivocally that it does not work. This is not the report of a neophyte to computers or audio equipment; I know both, and this unit does not do the job. It'd be so nice if converting RCA to USB was easy and affordable, but the adapter needed to do it is a shade more expensive, in the $50-$100 range."
4,USB Sound Card Adapter for Laptop use,"My company provided me a laptop for business use, and to make sure, ordered it from Lenovo without the sound hardware.This device allows me to view You Tube videos now with sound. It works fine. Just plugged it in and it works.It's a little bulky, and when plugged in to my side USB port, it elevates the computer such that the weight is taken by the device. I have to put the laptop on a book when I use this adapter and have the adapter hang over the side of the book (we are talking about 1/4 inch) Also, I don't like how the LED flashes constantly when audio streams thru.It is inexpensive and works well except for the few negatives mentioned."
3,It Works.........,"My laptop audio jack has a short in it and only works on the left side. I got this as a cheap work-around. It works, but is by no means ""studio quality"". At high volume there is distortion. For the price it will do the job for now."
1,Save your Dollar,"It works and while the price may attract you to this soundcard, you should save your dollar and buy a different one. There was an insane amount of static. I had wanted to use it with my PS3, but there was just way too much static to stand. I also tried it with my laptop and again there was an EPIC amount of static. I went with the LOGITECH USB TO 3.5MM JACK STEREO HEADSET AUDIO ADAPTER and that one works great.Logitech USB To 3.5mm Jack Audio Adapter"
1,Crap,"You get what you pay for. This device works for only one week. It stared heating up my ear-buds to the point were I count't wear them more that 30 minutes, then it died after one week. Don't buy it."
3,Don't doall what I wanted,I wanted to use this with my Samsung tablet and Skype. No go but It does work with the voice to type feature.
2,Not For Recording And Monitoring,"For those who have laptops with combo jack like the lenovo g580, and like recordingyou might be thinking of getting this, look for a better one, dont waste your money.Based on some reviews I read, some complaining about not being able to use the headphones and mic together, which is a real problem when trying to record in audacity, internal mic and headphone soundcard do a better job. another problem is that it comes apart. So get one that uses USB 3.0 and make sure its well built, and that it can record and monitor. The best ones are over $20"
3,It didn't work very well with ps3 if I remember correctly,"I bought this a long time ago to use on my ps3 for surround sound headphones and microphone input, but I remember it would not work with both headphones and mic simultaneously, so it did not serve my purpose well and it ended up in a duffle bag full of other useless electronic junk. I guess if you have a computer with a broken headphone jack, this baby would do the trick."
3,It does its job.,"For 2 bucks I am content. It does exactly what I ordered it for, which was to hook up my X360 Turtle beaches to my PS3, but I just never seem to want dig this out and plug it up..."
2,meh :/,Sounds like my microphone is in the bottom of a hole in the ground. As cheap as it is do not expect anything and you will be ok with what you get.
2,Falls,"""fell"" apart literally at the touch of my hand. Snaps back together easily and I put 2 thin strips of duct tape on the ends. The duct tape works fine and was faster than returning it and getting a different converter. Still, the consumer shouldn't have to fix their product the day after they get it"
2,Very Tinny,I guess this is better than nothing but the sound quality is pretty poor. You get a bit of a hum and the sound quality is very tinny. I would definitely not recommend this item.
1,Absolutely Useless,"This product is absolutely a pile of crap. I already had low expectations but though to check it out anyway. Its not just with the PC I needed it for, I checked it with several, all with the same results, hence unable to blame a individual unit. As a sound engineer and technician, this product is probubly the worse audio interfact I have ever tried to work with. Purely an insult to the common user community. I am glad it was cheap. Its now in the garbage bin....Rule of thumb, you get what you pay for and I knew it going into it, but thought, oh well, why not...Never again...."
2,good cheap card,i bought a headset to replace my dead soundcard and got this adapter with it. the sound quality is good on my headset but is not so good on external speakers. also there is a very loud and annoying chirping when used with skype
1,Not worth the $4.00,I needed an external 5.1 usb adapter. This was only about $4.00 but wasn't worth 4 cents. It fell apart the first time I put it in and didn't work.What a piece of junk. Don't bother with this even if it is free with free shipping.
3,it's worth the money,it worked for like a month then started making this cracking sound. I dont think the mic outlet worked for me but it cudda just been my cpu but like i said u get what u pay for....
1,Dont Buy,"DID NOT WORK AT ALL, VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING IT WAS LIKE THAT OUT OF THE PACKAGING"
2,"great audio, lower build quality.","now that i've gotten it to work it's great, if only it worked with my audio software then the audio would be amazing. still a good for the price though. the build quality is lower and it feels like it could break if you hit it by accident, but all small USB devices feel like that to me, can't beat it for $1.50.2 months later it broke, bad build quality."
1,Stopped Working in Couple Days,"Very cheaply made product, which I expected. Basically the quality of something you could buy at a 99 cent store. Mine worked for about 2 days, then started making crackeling noises, then only worked at certain angles, then stopped working altogether. I never dropped it or damaged it in any way. Simply a POS product."
2,Good for gaming systems,"Good for use in gaming systems to use your 3.5mm headphones with a gaming system, but not much else. For some odd reason when I use ear buds (so far Apple earbuds, JVC HA-FX1X, and some cheap Coby ones) they get very HOT. Not the card itself, but rather the actual bud. Also the sound is muffled and the red LED might be annoying to some people. Sound quality is good for voice, but not much else.Pros:-Cheap-Works with a PS3Cons:-Bad sound quality-May cause ear drum burns"
2,Only worked for a MONTH,This USB worked for a month and today the usb connector snapped off when I disconnected it from the usb port and I did it gentle!!I rated 2 since it worked great but the material is way to cheap.I recommend you DON'T buy this product unless you want this incident to happen.
5,works great,"I use this for a custom mac I built and it works perfectly. I am only using desktop speakers, so I can't comment on if it has perfect sound quality. For the price though you can't beat it."
2,Very dissapointed.,"I got a Turtle Beach Z1 but I needed a sound card for console use. When I got this as soon as I dropped it the casing fell off. I didn't bother fixing so I left the circuit board bare. After a few weeks of purchasing it, it suddenly wouldn't work. If I bought this for anything more, I would be very angry. I wouldn't bother with this, it's cheaply made, and easily breaks."
3,It Works For Stereo,"This is one of the least expensive pieces of electronics I have ever purchased and that should be a clue. I used this with myTritton PC51u USB Powered True 5.1 Analog Gaming Headset for PC (TRI905120002/04/1)and found that it did produce stereo analog 5.1 channel sound effects. That means I heard stereo from all eight speakers in my headphones (four per ear). However, it was 'enhanced' stereo. I could only adjust the main rear and subwoofer controls, but not the center or front channels, even though sound was achieved from all speakers. It is small and easy to plug into any USB port and the sound was just as good as a direct plug into the back of my desktop - just without true 5.1 surround sound. For stereo - it's perfect."
1,Awfully shoddy,I would highly recommend not buying this. It's very cheaply made and comes apart even with one slight tug. I had this all of 5 days before it broke on me. Look elsewhere a little higher up in price range if you want a lasting adapter.
4,Great for DJ's,"If you have a DJ program - Digital DJ Pro - that will allow to play two songs at once and separate them through headphones, then get this! There is a slight delay in what is going to be heard, but after a little practice you'll get down pat, and be like DJ Caffeine on dancefactoryfm.com Very easy to install, just plug it in, that it."
3,It works... BUT--,"My BFF Bought this for me because my sound Jack broke.Does it work? Yes. Initially perfectly. A bit Trebley (In opposed to bassy) but loud and good.HOWEVER,My Earbuds get really hot. o____oI have 3 pairs, I switched them incase it was something about the specific ones, but its not.When you listen to earbuds through these they heat up and get super hot in your ears, which I imagine isnt good for the earbuds OR your ears.."
2,"Works, but sounds like crap","just like others have said, the crackling / gain / overdrive distortion on this thing is AWFUL... Better than no sound, but not by much.Pay a bit more for the 7.1 version. I ordered both and it sounds crystal clear."
2,Fragil,Breaks easily. Besides the earphone get really hot when I am using them. Appears that they are gonna get on fire.
1,no,cheap piece of crap ordered 2 by accident and one broke the 2nd day. They help with volume yes but what goos is that if the darn usb plug breaks right out of it
3,Material demasiado malo!!!,"Este USB hace lo que hace. Llego en perfecto estado, pero el material es tan malo que me duro dos o tres dias. Al sacarlo, al meterlo o algun golpecito hizo que ya no funcionara mas. Mejor pagar dos euros mas y que el plastico sea mejor, este mejor soldado y no sean tan fragil. La palabra es CUTRE."
2,Like they say...Good for Two-Three MTH's won't buy here again!,Lasted two plus months ....Just quit...????We all remember this feeling....looking for price when I needed a fix for my HP laptop.
2,You get what you pay for.,It was a couple of bucks and lasted a couple of days. I bumped the unit while in use and the thing broke. Its pretty predictable.
1,Thumbs down,just as cheap as it looks when u get is please not be fool by the specs it is totally not a good product it didn't even last a week 2 uses and it was not good. It fell and that was it. Plz do good advertising it helps
1,dislike,"this product didn't work for me so it was useless buy, i didn't like it. And don't recommend it sorry"
3,Better than nothing I suppose...,"I got this adapter as a replacement for my broken headphone jack which I used to plug my speakers into.With the adapter (Used in conjunction with my Logitech X-240 Speakers), however, there is a small, but noticeable, amount of static coming from some songs. I can't be sure as to what causes the static, but in the songs where it does occur, lowering the 8K and 16K settings in the iTunes equalizer makes most of it go away.But, if you're like me and like loud music, you will be disappointed. Turning up the volume makes the speakers sound like they're going to blow out any second. This didn't use to happen when I didn't need the adapter.In review: It's not terrible, but not great. Not for loud music fans."
2,cheaply made crap,"I use a laptop and I was having problems with the sound for a while. The jack got messed up somehow so I could only hear if I had my headphones pugged into the jack at some odd angle and I constantly had to wiggle it into place. After a while that didn't work anymore so I had to find an alternative...I bought this thing. It works. When I first plugged it in I was surprised that it actually worked but I wasn't blown away by the sound quality. I was just happy I could hear something. Anyway, it has been a few days and it still works but not very well. There is lots of static in the background and sometimes the sound cuts off completely. Also, itunes doesn't always recognize it but WMP does. I don't get that. This product is very cheaply made. I don't recommend it. There has got to be something better out there!"
1,This product is DANGEROUS.,"Upon plugging this device into my Mac Mini, after about a minute, it told me that it had shut off power to the USB powers because a device was drawing too much power.A few minutes later, it displayed that message again, whereupon I realized that I could smell that electronic smoke smell that you get when a silicon chip eats itself. I quickly yanked the device. It was so hot that it nearly scalded me just to yank it quickly from the back of my machine.I do not yet know if this device caused any permanent damage to my Mac Mini; I am hopeful that Apple's power protection was able to prevent any actual damage. On a lesser machine, this device would have undoubtedly fried the motherboard.This product should be *immediately* pulled from Amazon, and Amazon should not allow it to be sold again until the manufacturer can prove compliance with U.S. product safety standards."
4,"Passable Sound, Good Price, Nothing Fancy","I got this USB sound card to replace a bad sound card in a used Pentium II Thinkpad that I got. I am running Ubuntu Linux 8.10 which recognized the sound card, though you need to make sure it is OSS rather than ALSA on the settings. I had some reservations about ordering it, because of the number of reviews that had complaints. The sound was about the same quality as the sound card would have been if it was working, which is all that I wanted. The USB plug did not fit the side port, it was too thick on the plastic to snuggle in, so I used an extension USB inbetween and it worked fine. I did not want to buy a more expensive USB card and this one did the job. I did not test the microphone and do not know how it works."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The seller was fast and as helpfull as they could be but there are major problems with this product.As other people have posted, this thing will just stop working after a few months. Worked great at first then three months later it died. contacted the seller, they were quick to get back to me (thumbs up for that!) and said there is no solution to fix it. They quickly sent me a replacement (thumbs up again!) but the second one has stopped working also. It attempts to start up sporadically when I try different usb ports, but it's looking like it's dead for good now.If you're looking for a quick audio fix and don't need it for more than a month or so, this product is for you! Otherwise, don't waste your money."
1,Waste of money,"I ordered two of these (since they're so small they would be easy to lose). With a MacBook, I got an unacceptable amount of hum and distortion on both of them. Not just a ""little"" bit bad but REALLY bad sound. Absolutely useless. I didn't even bother to try the microphone."
2,Doesn't work in the slightest,"Neither my laptop nor my desktop could recognize the software. One uses XP (laptop) and the other Windows 7. I downloaded the driver from the official website, and it did not install, even after complying to the prompt to plug in the device. I give it two stars, giving the benefit of the doubt that it will work after a look into its innards, and trusting the words of those saying it does work. However if it does not conform to that expectation I will be returning it for a refund of my $2."
1,I'm serious. Please save yourself the dissatisfaction I went through.,"I bought this when the audio jack on my laptop went out. How could I go wrong? its only 2 bucks, right? Well that would be great if it were worth 2 dollars. Honestly, however, I could build a better sound card with coat hangers and a soldering iron.THE AUDIO QUALITY ON THIS IS TERRIBLE. When you turn up the volume past about 3% it sounds like your speakers are going to blow. DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,Horrible interferences,"When plugged in (I dont know if the problem occured when it was new) you can first of all hear a kind of burshing sound.On top of that, both ports interfere between eachother. Example: When on a Skype call or any other software the person on the other end can hear the video im watching. Any sound I listen to goes to the microphone. NOT GOOD!Otherwise, sound isnt that bad.Worth its price..."
3,Works...for about 5 minutes.,"Seriously. It's cheap, but it will only work for the first 5 minutes. after that it will work/not work on and off. It only works when it wants to it seems."
1,Just don't bump it.,"So I hooked this bad boy up to my computer 1/15/10. I come home the night of 1/17, bump it as I sit down at my PC, and it stops working. For the short time I used it, it was exactly what I wanted it to be. But now, it is nothing but landfill. I do not recommend anyone buy this item."
5,Came apart...,"Well it worked on my ps3 with my mic headset, but it came apart and i had to tape it back up. Works still, i love it. :)"
3,"It does the job, but has its problems.","I purchased this a few weeks because it was a great deal, but you get what you pay for. Yes it was simple to install basically plug and play and yes it did have decent sound quality and it did its job. The only real problem I have had with it is its very flimsy and feels very cheaply made I almost broke it a few times and I have a feeling it will break sooner or later. So if your very careful and don't want to spend the extra few dollars to get a better one then this will do."
2,Frailest of the Frail,"Worked great for about 90 minutes; until the cheap, brittle plastic casing shattered in my hands under no pressure. Regrettable purchase,i recommend purchasing a similar unit, only a more durable model."
1,it litteraly fell appart,"this product was great till day 3 when i plugged it into my computer, not force full at all, just slid it in, and it fell apart in my hand!!!! very cheaply made!!! do not buy!!!!"
4,Faster Shipping,"The device came way sooner than the allowance for shipping. I think I got it in a little over a week. The device isn't amazing, but for the price it's pretty good."
1,Spend a little more,"I bought this so that I could use my headphones and it broke within a week. If I could do it again I would save my $2 and get a $5 adapter somewhere else. It never really fit flush into my USB port, that allowed it to flex and fall apart."
2,"Good sound output, except for the static...","There is noticeable static coming through the speakers which are mostly noticed when quiet songs are playing. It is pretty frustrating when the static overpowers it, but louder stuff sounds much better than the standard output on my laptop. I guess it's a gamble. I probably wouldn't buy this product again but would go for a better quality external sound card. If you happen to get one that doesn't cause static, this product is amazing."
3,Works ok for headset input,"I use this only as an adapter to plug my headset into a USB port (the microphone jack on my PC does not work correctly.) It does the job sufficiently. Only problem: there is a small problem with the speaker jack. If plugged in all the way, there is no sound. The plug needs to be pulled out a bit to get it in the correct position to hear sound in both channels - an inconvenience, but for only $3, I will most likely get a replacement that works correctly."
1,Takes too long to arrive and doesn't work,"The driver crashes repeatedly making it unusable (am using Windows 7). The build quality is cheap, I accidentally dropped it from 2 feet on carpeted floor and its casing broke into two. It will take 4-5 weeks to arrive to a US address. The product does say that it is shipped from Hong Kong, I missed that, so can't blame the seller for it."
1,Poor Sound Quality,The sound quality with this adaptor is horrible. There is added static and interference. I do not recommend purchasing this product.
5,Trully awsome sound,"this piece of equipment will give you an awsome powerfull sound. i have a toshiba laptop that used to be connected to my 5.1 digital dolby surround sound, that was only receive 2.0 from my laptop, the sound was horrible. but today i just received my USB virtual external sound card... and it is amazing. i prolly will never watch Jurassic Park on DVD with the beautiful sound as it got me. i am happy and impressed how this little device really works :)"
1,heats up alot,The device heats up a lot. Not happy with the purchase. Sound quality is not good.... you will hear disturbance when plugged to speaker.
3,"Eh, it's ok.","I got these for a simple reason; the kindergarten and first grade students in my school couldn't reach the headphone plugs at the back of the iMacs in our computer lab. Plugging these into the Keyboard USB solved that problem. Using them for that simple job made these devices ideal: easy to use, cheap if broken, and not too big to cause problems. If you need something that works for mic input, go with iMic. I use it for my podcasting. Or get this-GTMax USB 2.0 to 3.5mm Female Audio Stereo Microphone Adapter. It gives you one input, but you can use the headphone port for the other."
1,Extremely Loud,I should have listen to the other reviewers. On the lowest level it too loud. It's low quality china product. Obviously the price reflect that.
2,Not good,"I was upset after I bought this, it was a real struggle to read the whole book. The author uses much taken from other books, such as you'll never guess what they call the spy team? They call it tean 'Bond'. Come on is that the best you can do.The book was slow, jumps from charater to character and is hard to follow, the story is ok."
3,Funny but not great,"Spy High was a very enjoyable book but was not a great book. Some of the things in Spy High that were good was some of the dialog, and the conflict that the characters face. In Spy High there are two different conflicts that the main characters face. Some of the things that made this story bad were the characters and the conflict between the group and the description of the characters. In the story the two main characters Ben and Jake fight all the time in Spy High and it was that that made Spy High a good but not great story. I gave Spy High three stars out of five stars because of these concepts."
5,Spy High,"great book not as good as Alex Rider,but good. I finished all 6 books of Alex Rider and i tried this and it was good."
4,Really awsome book,"Spy High:Mission One is a really great spy book. In the book, 6 teenagers end up in a school that teaches them to be spys. Because this group of kids aren't doing to well together, the school sends them on a camping trip. They hope the kids will get to know each other more. Instead, the kids get involved with a mad scienctist who works with group of terrorists. This book has alot of action and suspence in it, and I'm glad the AJ Butcher had some imagination when he thought of spys. I recomend it to everyone who likes action, spys, and the like, although maybe not to younger kids because the ending might be to scary."
4,Give Spy High A Try,"This series is definitely one for those who enjoy books such as the Alex Rider series and other spy books. Set in a futuristic setting, Deveraux Academy is not justthe elusive high school as it seems: it's much more. A high school (rightly nick-named Spy High) that trains students as (you guessed it) spies, to be exact. The Bond Team students have been hand picked and marked to succeed- but will the differences of its six members make things worse when they are put into a real (non-holographic) situation? The characters are enjoyable and easy to relate to- and even though it can be a bitsy predictable at times, the books' fast-pace, energy, characters, and thrill make up for it. And I for one, enjoyed this series quite a lot. :)"
2,How disappointing,"Although I anticipated this book because of its concept, and gave it two stars for that concept, I have to admit that I'm really disappointed by this book. The characters are cardboard cutouts of teens who don't seem to have any feelings other than the need to win--whether it's in class, training, love, or virtual reality. The characters quickly got on my nerves because they were so one-dimensional. The supposedly witty repartee felt forced. It was unbelievable. The chapter headings and endings (in a font that's nearly impossible to read) aren't tantalizing--because they float above the story somewhere, unconnected. This could have been a great series. It has a great premise, but it's nearly impossible to read--and I try to finish everything I read to give it a fair chance. Not this book."
3,It was not what I expected,"I bought this book because someone recommended it. I am keeping it because even though it was not what I expected, it has some worth to a quilter."
5,Great techniques and patterns,"I have a lot of quilting books/magazines on techniques and on patterns and this one provided NEW information. First off, the authors do not recommend adding a quilt border, just because you need to add a border. They ask that you decide if a border is needed. They also showed their 'one-step binding' method and also the tradidtional binding method, which is in all of the other books/magazines.The patterns are also wonderful and ordered from simple to complex. They have a completed quilt and also pictures of the quilt using different colors to demonstrate how color affected the 'mood' of the quilt. They encourage you to select your own colors.I haven't started on these quilt patterns but plan to try out some of their techniques on my next project.Note: there are no applique quilts here."
4,Happier Feet,"These really have improved my foot comfort; I walk on cement all day and have been buying everything I can find for the last 7 years to make my feet ache a little less. This product was really good; not excellant, but really good."
3,Kind of wide,"These are kind of wide. They provide very good support, but because they are so wide I can't use them in my tennis shoes. They are okay for my walking shoes (old tennis shoes) and makes walking more stable and comfortable. I use Superfeet for my tennis shoes. They are not as soft but they fit in the shoe well and they also provide very good support."
2,wore out quickly,"Initially it feels great and fits perfectly if you get order the right size, but in just about 2 weeks i started seeing wear and tear. I am only 180lbs and the 10.5 men sole is no longer usable after 2 weeks,"
3,Lots of support but not very durable,"At first I fell in love with my Powersteps but as 4+ months went by not so much anymore. They provide lots of support and once my feet adjusted I could spend the day standing no problem. However, after about four months the foam quickly degraded under the heals which unfortunately rendered them useless. For a smaller person this may occur so quickly but at 200 pounds my Pinnacles could not withstand daily use. I feel that such and item should last at least 6 months."
3,"Good, but not as good as a prescription orthotic.","I bought the Powerstep inserts to try to transition away from an older prescription orthotic that I had been using for years.They were much cheaper to buy on Amazon than at my Podiatrist.Overall they were comfortable, and it's better than having nothing in your shoe.But they didn't provide arch support where I really needed it, particularly in the transverse arch.I had some knee pain after running with them for a few months.After researching all the options, my solution was to go with a prescription orthotic that was molded to my foot while standing. That's given me the best result so far."
4,Cured My Wife's Foot Pain,"My wife is on her feet all day and has been trying different insoles and shoes for quite some time. After finally getting some professional help, she was referred to these arch support insoles and they've done wonders.This is her 2nd pair after 3 months with her 1st. For the price however, replacing them each quarter is a small price to pay for happy feet."
1,effective but poor quality,"I bought two pair of the 3/4 length supports just 3 weeks ago to heal my Plantar Fasciitis. They are helping me make progress but the top fabric liner is badly peeling off on both pair already and the edges are badly frayed all around. They look terrible and will not perform well anymore with rolled up liner rubbing under my feet. I bought them because the doctor said they were more effective...and I like that they are American Made but c'mon, this is poor quality. My Spenco's lasted for 5+ years and still look very good."
5,It hit the spot!,My husband purchased these a few weeks ago from the New Balance store and he loves them! He has really high arches and was getting pain in his left arch. He needed extra support in a particular area on his arch and these insoles hit that spot. Now he wants these insoles all of his work shoes. The prices of these on Amazon ($29) is so much more affordable than at the New Balance store ($44). I think I might give these a try myself!
4,Great for the feet,Very helpful in supporting arches. If you are on your feet a lot this is a great product. Have them in all my shoes.
1,Would NOT recommend these,"I had read the reviews and hoped these would help my heel pain. I have been to the podiatrist who had given me shot of cortisone without relief and thought perhaps these insoles would help. Within 10 minutes of wearing them I was in more pain than I had been in the months previous. Thinking it may be the shoe I was wearing, I changed shoes and it did not make a difference. I have tried them twice and cringe at the thought of ever using them again."
1,I Was Not Happy With This Product,I was not happy with this product. Didn't feel good on my feet; so I never ended up using these in my shoes.
3,THIS ARCH is mad HIGH,"I don't know if its my shoe but standing in these for a long period of time I can certainly feel the arch is forced into the mid-high part of the bottom of my foot. They hurt but not as bad as without them, maybe I should look for another shoes to wear different shoes, boots, sneakers different results :/"
4,Good for flat feet,My son has really flat feet and these are comfortable and give him good support. He was able to walk all day.
5,Good,These where to replace my very old orthotics that were prescribed by my foot doctor. They work just as good as the 300 dollar ones I got from the doctor.
4,not bad at all....,"superfeet are better, yes. Are they miles ahead, that doesn't seem to be true. These are fine, supportive, and almost as good...for a much better price. after that, its your call if you have cash to burn."
5,TWO THUMBS UP!,"I' been using these insoles for a few years now and will never wear shoes again without them. I am flat footed as a duck and predictably developed plantar factitious in both feet. This product help alleviate the pain and has kept me pain free since.Keep in mind however, one cannot just throw these in your shoes and wear then all day at first, they take getting used to and should only be worn a few hours a day to start and slowly build up to all day wear over about two weeks."
5,dancr/walkr,"I'm a very active person who walks at least twice a day and dances frequently. My feet are also narrow, so finding shoes that fit properly has also been a problem. These Powerstep Pinnacle orthotics have relieved most of those problems and I have them in every pair of my walking, exercising and dance shoes."
2,"Good Price, But Not Good Value","The inserts were as described, and are quite comfortable, but they are not durable. The blue covering fabric started to separate from the base almost immediately and after only a few months of occasional use, the fabric bunches uncomfortably under my heel. I had been looking for a less expensive alternative to the Lynco inserts, which cost 2 or 3 times as much. But I still have Lynco inserts which have been heavily used for 3 or more years and they are worn, but still very serviceable. I tossed the Powersteps and purchased more of the Lyncos--better value in the long run."
2,sizing off,I ordered a size 9-9.5 as my shoe is a size 9. There is a space between the insole and the toe of the shoe. The insole is too small.
5,Powerstep shoe inserts,I have diabetes and must be extremely careful about my feet. These inserts provide exceptional support and are extremely comfortable.
4,Good insoles,"This was my first time wearing orthotics so I didn't know what to expect. The insoles did feel a bit ""hard"" on my feet at first but I got used to them after a week of wearing them. Insoles fit perfectly in my shoes. Not to thin. Not too thick. Comfortable after you get used to them. Overall, it's a good product."
2,Product did not work for me but company upheld their guarantee,"I purchased these for my daily shoes in the hopes they would feel good and help with arch support. Unfortunately for me, they did not work and they caused problems in my hip area. I returned them to the company and requested a refund which they sent promptly. So while the product did not work for me the company that makes them stands behind what they sell. So if you are looking for something similar to this the money back guarantee might make it worth it for you to try them out and see if they work for you."
4,quality vs. comfort,"These are by far the best foot supports I've found,but they don't hold up. They are comfortable, but the top lining separates from the foam in a matter of 2-3 monthes. I still buy them because they do wonders for my feet,I just wish they would fix this problem."
2,Comfortable but have short life,"The Powerstep Pinnacle is very comfortable and gives the support I need, but the lining wears through PREMATURELY on all FOUR pairs in the past year. Two of the pairs wore through near the ball of foot, one pair the lining tore loose from the side. On the fourth pair just put into service YESTERDAY, I notice the lining separating from the sides again. Once the lining has worn through, the foam disintegrates very quickly.This company either has a manufacturing defect on these insoles, or they lack durability and should be redesigned. I looking into other brands ... disappointing as they ARE comfortable, but too expensive to have to replace this often."
3,It was alright,"Bought these insoles just by looking at the previous reviews it had and it sounded promising, however when I wore them it worked for a little while then about 3 months later I had to get new ones. I work two jobs on my feet 13 hours a day and I was hoping this would've lasted me at least 6 months but it didn't...was worth a try"
4,"Seems to help, fits in shoes well.","My self-diagnosed plantar fasciitis has mellowed a bit since using these in my casual dress shoes. At first, it's odd because it forces you to walk on the outer side of your feet, but I suppose that's the point.These slipped easy into several pairs of my shoes, both when removing the original sole, and when leaving the original in.My only reason to not give it 5 stars is that I'm not cured yet, and because they seems a little pricey for a piece of plastic that you put in your shoe."
5,Great,It does exactly as it claims. My heal pain decreased. I put these inserts in most of my shoes. Great product.
2,Worn out in 2 months,"My Husband wore these inside his work shoes and they came apart after 2 months of continuous use. They fit well and gave good support, but the top layer peeled off they the whole insole came apart.These will probably be fine for normal use, just don't expect them to last!"
3,Not great for some athletic shoes - try 3/4 insoles instead,"These work okay for dress or casual shoes. Relatively easy to swap between shoes. However, in my experience not good for athletic shoes. Too wide to fit into my volleyball shoes. When I use these for tennis, I feel the bottom of my feet burning because there is too much friction. A better alternative is Superfeet 3/4 easy-fit insoles. Never tested these for running so cannot comment on that."
2,Regular ones work better,"I have used the Original Powerstep inserts with much success, so thought these would be even better: wrong. The arch seems overly high and stiff, and they make the bottom of my foot sore (almost as if it's cramping up) if I wear them for more than just short periods."
3,Not quite what I was hoping for.,I've been looking for a pair of insoles for my runners with better arch support than the stock ones. I ordered these but the support seems a little too high for my arches. Instead of comfortably cradling my arch they sort of jab in making it uncomfortable to run for long periods. Whats worse is they seem to be uneven. The one on the left although a bit too high feels relatively balanced while the arch support for the one on the right seems like it's way higher. I guess this is the downfall of trying one-size-fits-all solutions for footwear.
5,Still the best for plantar fascitis,"This is the perfect balance of support and comfort for my feet. I also use custom orthotics but instead of switching them out with each pair of shoes/boots, I use the pinnacle in most."
5,Happy feet,"These were just the ticket for helping correct my flat feet. Very comfortable, perfect fit for my shoes, and at a good price."
3,Very little cushion/high arches.,"I gave these inserts three stars because they are well made, but they have really high arches and the cushion is like walking on concrete."
5,Very good for Plantar Faciitis,I bought these shoe inserts because I have plantar faciitis in my right heel. They work exactly fine for this problem. They have the high arch and soft heel that one needs for plantar faciitis. A big plus is that they were cheaper than anywhere I could find locally.
5,Pwerstep Pinnacle,Worth there weight in Gold. I bought them as Christmas gifts for family members I liked mine so much. Best
5,Great for standing on concrete!,"I developed plantar fasciitis (sp?) from standing on concrete 40 hrs a week for 15 years, and had to find something to help with the pain. These fit well in all of my tennis shoes that have removable inserts (most brand names), and into my leather slip-ons as well. They have a very high arch, which is what I need. They saved me hundreds because I didn't have to buy all new shoes, too!"
3,Orthotics off the rack,"Good price, good product. Howver, it is generic and if you really need orthotics, best to have them individually fitted. These are a good value."
2,it was ok,I think i bought this and never used it because it didnt leave much room for your feet and the top of my feet started to bruise.
4,worked great for me,I bought these as I was having issues with Plantar fasciitis. It really helped move along my healing process. I put them in my workout shoes and wore them everywhere for a few weeks. I was to the point that I couldn't even walk on my foot when I got out of bed. It took about 1 month of wearing them and my foot is all better and no more pain. These worked great. They do increase the height in your workout shoes even when you take out the insoles that come with the shoe. I had to loosen my laces a little bit to get my shoe to fit comfortably but other than that there were no more adjustments.
5,Best Over the Counter Arch Supports I Have Purchased,"I suffer from flat feet (as many people do). I have purchased supports from everywhere included the podiatrist. For the most part they all work. These are very comfortable, they are full length (will not move) and affordable. I actually found these at a local New Balance store (after my Dr suggested going there for some new supports) and the retail price was $34.99 for the same exact supports. Great product for the price."
3,Need more arc support.,"It is ok I guess but it does not fit most of the shoes I have (eg. converse). It is too wide for most shoes.Also, after you've inserted the orthotic, you'll have to loosen the shoelace because it takes up quite a lot of room. Also, it will make your feet appears ""bigger"" and more robust, which is not really pleasant looking (but yea I understand it is not about the look but you know I'm just saying)Overall, it feels comfortable and does its job."
3,OK but my feet prefer others,These are ok but my feet prefer pinnacle max and orange super feet and I work on my feet and have chiropractor orthotics also.
3,The beginning of the end,"If you have been a Blumchen fan for a while now, you probably won't get into this album as much as others just finding her out and who are more familiar with Jasmin Wagner as a pop, not dance icon. Personally this change is turning my stomach. I don't know if she has plans of trying to make it big in America or England, but with the following she had in Germany, I'm confused by what she is out to prove. My guess is that she had an argument with Paralyzer (the person who really makes the music).Anyway, this is the first Blumchen CD I've ever not given 5 stars to, and it's even hard for me to justify 3. The only really good track is the last one (out of 4), a live Blumchen medley apparently from her ""Live in Berlin"" album. This is different than the one that appeared on ""Jasmin"". There are a couple good minutes of the Christmas song, but not enough to warrant importing unless you are a collector and have to have everything she does."
1,QUALITY IS SO BAD,"You could not see anything in the one I received. It was a gift for a 3 year old. he was so excited, tore it open, tried to vies - and it was all black. If you heild it an inch away from a strong light buld, you could barely make out the figures"
1,BattleTech at its worst,"Out of all the 50+ BattleTech novels, this is one of the absolute worst. Ardath Mayhar starts out badly and gets worse in a book that, by its own merits, could easily have killed the series. Characterizations are bad, the dialogue worse, and you will find little to no suspense or drama here. My advice is to find another BattleTech book and try and forget that this one ever existed."
5,The rest are downhill,"This Was the first B-tech book, and It sets the tone for the remaining 30 something books. I've read them all and This ranks at the top."
1,The first BattleTech novel - and it shows,"I got this book some time ago when it was out of print because I had to have all of the BattleTech novels. The book was a huge disappointment. The writing style is poor and the plot weak. This was the first BattleTech novel and it shows, some of the technology used is different from anywhere else in the BattleTech universe. The main plot is the cloning of Hanse Davion by Laio to replace him, a theme that crops up again when Victor Davion attempts to clone Thomas Marik's dying only son and male heir in a later Stackpole novel.From what I understand there was some kind of dispute between the author and FASA so the book went out of print and is unlikely to be reprinted. The best BattleTech novels are, IMHO, those written by Stackpole, who sadly no longer writes in the BattleTech universe."
1,Not worth the effort,"I saw this on [an auction website] and went to the trouble of bidding for it. DON'T BOTHER. The small tidbits of the story you can glean out of other Battletech books pretty much give you the idea. Poor characterizations of Hanse Davion and Ardan Sortek and a bland story line make this novel a chore to read. The story discusses House Liao's attempt to insert a double on the throne of the Federated Suns. Hanse Davion, leader of the Federated Suns, along with Ardan Sortek must stop Liao from succeeding. Stick with Michael Stackpole for good stories about House Davion or Robert Charrette for stories about House Kurita."
1,Ugh,This is one of the worst books I've ever read; and I've read William Shatner's works.This book is mainly high value/demand due to low printing and because it was the first Battletech novel.
3,"Average book, but c'mon people STACKPOLE [disappoints]","Like an earlier reviewer said, this book is average, but I'm SICK of hearing how Stackpole is a good writer. PLEASE! The best authors in the B-Tech Universe are unquestionably Robert Charrette, Bill Keith and Loren Coleman. And for what its worth, the whole 'clone Hanse' was pretty novel in 87, but Stackpole copied it half-a-dozen times and he just basically went with the Western-esque states, i.e. Davion and Steiner, and made them the ""good guys"" and the Asian ones, Kurita and Liao, the ""bad guys"". I can't reiterate how much he [disappoints] as a writer. Please, read Charrette, Keith, Coleman, Gressman or Pardoe over Stackpole, they are all INFINITELY better! Also, I really wish someone would folow up on Kubasik's book, there isn't much out there on House Marik..."
2,Almost kept me away!!!,"This was the first Btech novel I read as it was the first published. I thought it was so bad and I had so many better books to read in my library, I held off reading another Btech novels. I assumed that the others would also be as bad and didn't read another until boredom and a long bus ride caused crack open one of Stackpole's gems. I was hooked. The combat sequences and political intrigue of this book seem almost childish compared to the later books. The *only* reason I didn't give this book one star is because someone had to break ground for the other novels in the Battletech universe. I just wish this one would have been better."
1,Unsubstantiated Hooey,"Hoping to find some real alternatives to antibiotics, I was sorely disappointed. This book is just the same old ""naturalist"" magical thinking. Filled with wild, unsubstantiated claims both against antibiotics (and doctors in general) and for a ""natural"" lifestyle, the authors put forth the same tired thesis: Eat only vegetables, move out of the city, and consume vitamin C in doses equivalent to 2000 oranges a day and you'll never get sick."" They do offer some natural aid to alleviate symptoms when the magic inevitably fails, but no real remedies to help your body kill bacteria. Their theory appears to be that bacteria are a figmet of the modern hypochondriac's imagination.If you're sick, go to the doctor. Don't waste your money on this book."
4,"Finally, a jargon-free, practical model!","I was first introduced to Adair's work in the mid-eighties as a student at the Royal Military College of Canada. I've since revisited this book, and have found that the clear, simple expression of what leadership is, what leaders do and the interrelationship between the task, the group and the individual is still as relevant as it ever was. In a world of fads and gimmicks, John Adair's simple, pragmatic and battle-proven techniques are a refreshing change. It is too bad this title is out of print... perhaps the publishers will see fit to re-issuing it. After twenty-plus years of studying and teaching leadership, this is still the best practical guide I've ever found.Jeff Griffiths Vice President, Management Performance Practice, Canada Training Group, Calgary. jeffgriffiths@canada-training-group.ca"
4,"It's a MCSE study guide, not an Exchange mastering guide","If we state passing the exam as our main goal, the book is well written. I readed the entire book several times during the last month and I passed the exam at the first attempt with 720 over 1000. You can skip the Forms chapter. It is not an exam objective."
3,Easy to read but not enough,"My background of Exchange 5 was nill when I picked up this book to study for the exam. While it was easy to read, it did not really highlight the important information that was on the actual exam. I ordered the 400 test question software package from Self Test Software and that in addition to the book was enough to pass. I would not recommend this book as the only source of study material but it supplies a good source of information."
2,This book is not good preparation for the Exchange 5.0 exam.,"I read the book from front to back, with a recommendation that the Sybex books would be good preparation for the Exchange 5.0 exam 70-076. As I was reading through the book, I started to have doubts that this book was preparing me. The end of the chapter questions we way to easy. One would expect the questions to actually challenge you the way the actual exam does, and the exam is very challenging. I doubt I will buy anymore Sybex books as this one as left me really disappointed. If anyone is trying to prepare for the Exchange exam, I suggest the Special Edition Using Microsoft Exchange Server 5 from Que."
1,UNREADABLE,"Propaganda tool of the Hare Krishna's. Beware this book that apparently tries to make a case that Jesus was a disciple of the Hindu teachings of Sri Krishna. Work of fiction passed out at airports in exchange for donations by members of the infamous bald-headed, saffron-robed West Virginia cult. I got this from a Hare Krishna at Logan Airport in 1999 and read it on a flight home. It ranged from silly and stupid with its far-fetched claims, to slightly creepy. I don't think this has much to do with mainstream Hinduism or is connected to any serious research into the early years of Jesus. It's simply lukewarm scholarly quotes mixed with faith-based dogma and a bit of wishful fiction."
5,Fantastic!,This is an excellant book for those of us who know or feel we have an imbalance. Its helps you identify the root cause of your imbalance and covers all the latest supplements and natural hormones to put you on the straight and narrow.I thought my problems were due to reproductive hormones and whilst there were imbalances my real problem symptoms were being caused by the adrenals.
5,"Feeling Fat, Fuzzy or Frazzled?",Excellent book and easy reading. Very informative for self help and diagnosis when your doctors won't work with you. Would recommend this one!! Gives you the information you need.
1,Feeling FFF,"Don't waste your money with this book. Very repetitive, very boring. Frankly, you are better off with any other book."
2,Confusing and Gimmicky,"I was just diagnosed with a hypothyroid and I took this book out of the library because of all the great reviews it got here. However, I found the layout of the book confusing and spent more time searching for the pages that pretained to me than actually reading anything! It would have been better if they separated the book into three parts instead of mixing everything up. I was also turned off by the huge plug to use the high-quality vitamins and supplements that they endorse. Not everyone can afford to do that, and may not want to anyway. I wish they concentrated on diet instead of popping pills."
2,Happy until.....,"I was happy with this book up till about page 60 or so until I got to the point of the ""at home tests"". Here I was thinking that there was some way to easily test yourself, but when I finally went to the websites to take a look at the tests I found out they range from $200 to over $400!! And then to find out that there are a gazillion different vitamins/supplements to take!! Well, I guess I can give it 5 stars for helping me realize that I sure do have a thyroid problem and can talk to my doctor about it in more detail rather than him just saying ""your test came back normal"". I suggest getting it from your local library first and then buying it if you feel as though the info would eventually be helpful to you."
2,Very disappointing...,"I must say, I am astonished that this book has recieved the positive reviews that it has. I bought this book with the intent of gaining knowledge in the area of designing with grasses. I read it from start to finish and found that the entire text consisted of rambling, repetative, generalizations that were devoid of any substantial content. I was completely shocked that the authors would dare publish such wishy-washy material.In addition, many of the photos are out of focus and the corresponding descriptions are often incomplete. The descriptions of specific grasses are very brief and many very popular grasses are not included at all.I have never been more disappointed with a book purchase of any kind on any topic."
2,Gruppe weather station,"I returned this weather station as its barometer doesn't work at over 3800 feet above sea level, and I live at 5280 feet above sea level. It would have been nice to know that before ordering it. It looks good, though."
3,Easily Damaged by Squirrels,"This bird feeder is certainly beautiful and, at first, seems very well designed. However, squirrels have bitten away the cedar around the openings to get at the seed. The holes at the bottom are now too big to contain any seed and the feeder is now essentially a funnel. While I think I can repair this damage, the design should be reworked to include metal plates around the openings and perches. Or, the overall esthetics of the design could be preserved by lining the sides with the same kind of etched glass which comprises the body of the feeder. I would rate this feeder higher if it had come with some documentation warning me about the potential for squirrel damage. I don't know what I would have done though -- if I wanted to look at something as ugly as one of those ""satellite dishes"" I would have bought a plastic bird feeder. In sort, this is a beautiful bird feeder but you'll need to guard it against bushy-tailed vandals."
2,The Lead Guitar Kills The Mood,"I'm about as old as the band members and have been a fan since ""slowly we rot"". I was really, and mean really, disappointed with Ralph Santolla guitar influence. I know he's only sitting in temporally but his sound just isn't ""death metal"" its more like ""van halen"". I'm all for bands evolving and change can be good but in this case it was just a big let down. I can't wait for the return of Allen West!"
5,Obituary's best ever cd,"""Xecutioner's Return"" is Obituary's best cd ever.The songs tear the roof off and as heavy as ever for this veteran death metal band.Former Deicide guitarist Ralph Santolla takes Allen West's place for now and totally shreds throughout the cd.This Limited Edition Box verison has a 2-sided poster and bonus track-""Executioner Returns"".Don't miss out getting this Limited Edition verison of this cd.Obituary Rules."
1,Try elsewhere if you are looking for meaningful information.,"I originally purchased this work as a graduate microbiology student interested in seeing what was available for patients to read with trachoma in the United States. I was dismayed and shocked that someone would have to pay almost thirty dollars for the patry and sparse information contained within this work. More information can be easily found online and better advice concerning ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infections is available from your doctor's office. In all honesty, the ""Official Patient's Sourcebook on Trachoma"" has no merits and should not be purchased. I only hope that anyone interested in learning about trachoma reads this review prior to considering to purchase this work (if it can even be called that)."
4,Dickerson's JUST FOR A THRILL,"James L. Dickerson focuses upon Lillian 'Lil' Hardin as ahighly educated, multi-talented, and prestigious individual fromstardom in the early part of the Twentieth Century--when it wasnot ""cool"" to be both a black female and a vocalist/instrumental-ist--to her last recording. The biographer depicts Lil as one whowas willing to neglect opportunities that would foster her ownadditional success in order to promote her husband, Louis Arm-strong in his musical endeavors as a soloist and instrumentalist.The conflicts in management, the shifts from city to city, andthe rocky marriage, which eventually involved ""the other woman,""took a toll on the relationship between Lil and Louis. However,as Dickerson vividly emphasizes, Lil never lost her love for hermusical soulmate, with whom she nurtured their only child--jazz."
1,Disappointed,Not at all what I expected - FAR too clinical - I am not a statitician and I felt like I need a refresher course in statistics to plow through this book. What I HAD expected was an overview of statistics of the industry which would help determine marketing efforts for the future. Much too difficult to use for that purpose.
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this book based on the reviews. When I received it I realized something was wrong. The writing was mediocre, the editing was poor (misspellings, poor punctuation, no copyright or publishing data) so I looked it up and found that this is a self-published book. It shows. There's a reason why every writer can't get published, and there's a reason for book agents and editors (though we all know they don't necessarily ensure a good book). I even checked on the five-star reviewers, incredulous that this book got so many rave reviews. Voila! Most of them have written many reviews and they give five stars to ALL of them! And most of the books they review are self-published. One reviewer submitted more than one five-star review for the same book.I'll be a more careful consumer in the future. Self-publishing may have its place, but if you are looking for a well-written mystery like I was, Save Your $14.70."
2,Not five stars,Didn't understand the high ratings either. Good beach book but nothing outstanding. There's a decent enough plot to keep you entertained. The book is far from excellent however and the storyline is not particularly creative or believable.
1,Failed after just a few uses,Unit worked well untill the gears in the motor stripped out.I only used it about 3 or 4 times.. Bad News
1,A Bad Product,"The Shredder Shark SH12cdcc worked for a few weeks and then it wouldn't run any more. I called the company and was told that the sensor was probably blocked by paper. I returned the product and they sent me a new head. This worked for a few weeks and then the same thing happened. I took it apart, pulled out the stuck paper cuttings and put it back together. It worked again for a few weeks but now it's stopped again and I can't get it to work. This really is a bad product that doesn't work as advertised.jnix"
1,P.O.S.,"This thing has been sketchy from the get-go. First, it randomly chooses to work when ANY amount of paper is in, from one sheet to six. Sometimes it just craps out in the middle of a sheet. I bought a $90 paperweight. I was ripping up more paper by hand than this thing was. Now I have to pay to ship it back for a refund. Thanks Amazon. Great Job! Keep it up!"
2,"Not Spike's Best Work, But Still Entertaining","Although perennially overlooked by the Motion Pictures Academy, Spike Lee long ago proved that he is a thoughtful and engaging filmmaker (and not a racist, as some reviewers will lead you to believe). Unfortunately, his filmamking skills do not crossover to the world of books. While Best Seat in the House does provide an insighful look into the world of professional basketball, especially the New York Knicks teams of the early-1970s, it seems as if this book was written off the top of Mr. Lee's head, haphazardly putting to paper stories he recollects. If you are a Knicks fan, you'll enjoy this book. If you are more interested in Spike Lee, rent Do The Right Thing, Crooklyn, or any other of his provocative films"
2,Entertaining,"It is very nice to see an attempt at a biography of such a prominent catholic and American figure.As biographies go this book contains factual errors due either to poor research, mistypes, or bad editing. ie. refering to Henry Ford II as the son of Henry Ford.The author uses rather liberal animadversion to paint Archbishop Sheen in negative light. Suggesting that Sheen falsified his r.v. for purposes of professional or personal pride seems preposterous. An accusation of this gravity should be supported by reference of solid fact.In this reviewer's opinion a biography should be believable whether spinning the truth or otherwise.This book tends to make the hierarchy of the Catholic Church appear petulant and Archbishop Sheen quirky."
4,Captures the essence of life with Learning Disabilities.,"If you have learning disabilities or you have a family memember with learning disabilities, then you will be inspired by this book. This is the story of Evans' personal struggles in a family context as he strives for social acceptance and high education. He finds motivation in his Christianity and with his family. I strongly recommend. I read my life in this book."
2,Another way to RIP-OFF Elvis fans!!!,"This a product of some supposed artist/camera man. This is a JOKE!! I bought this book hoping it would have good pictures. The good pictures in this book... well, I can count them on one hand. The pictures do not show what your supposed to be looking at. Let's say it shows a picture of one of Elvis' costumes or hand written notes. Well it only shows a corner of it or it's out of focus or so close up you can't see the rest of it. When I purchase a book for pictures, I buy it wanting it to have clear full frame pictures with close up's to show detail. And the only reason it gets two stars is because its ELVIS. WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK UNLESS YOUR WILLING TO THROUGH YOUR MONEY AWAY!!"
5,Artful and poignant reflection on the King,"A well-designed collection of Elvis Presley imagery. Some are skillfully appropriated collages, some are simply gritty recordings of what was left behind. The author's technique reveals a body of work that embraces the fading and brittle nature of his subjects, sometimes amplifying and augmenting the effects of time on these artifacts. This is not your average Presley memorabilia book, but a thoughtful meditation that artfully illustrates both the boundless legend and peculiar idiosyncrasy of one of the most remarkable American icons."
4,Great Interview,"This DVD offers the aspiring screenwriter a chance to hear a successful screen writer talk about how he became a writer, how often he writes and where he writes, breaking into the business and his work on one of the most significant movies ever made (Fight Club). Mike De Luca usually has a list of well prepared questions that cover all aspects of writing and working in the film industry today. This DVD as well as the others are not really entertainment (although they can be) they are mostly educational."
4,Better but not great,"This is my second purchase of The Dialogue series. David Goyer was my first. De Luca, the interviewer, is still stiff, 50% of the time doesn't follow up with additional questions that would ""dig"" into the mind of the screen writer or his craft -- he's too focused on reading the prepared questions on his cards.To me this one was better and more informative than the Goyer interview. Still the best part is the ""screen writer exercise."" Uhls was presented with...you'll have to watch it. He did a great job.I like this idea but the format is dull. De Luc is chest deep in the film industry, but is not an effective interviewer."
2,Sandwich book,It's a good book for some different sandwich /lunch ideas but it takes quite a few special ingredients to craft these meals. This is not the book to put some variety in your sack lunch that you take to work. THis is the book you need when you have you mother in law over for lunch and you want to impress her with an exotic sandwich
1,Don't buy this book.,"I wish I hadn't bought this book, I was looking for some simple ideas for sandwiches and wraps. This isn't it!"
4,great kids movie,Storybook is a great kid movie in the style of the Chronicles of Narnia and the Princess Bride. It is somewhat cheesy but children will enjoy it.
3,SilBlades do not last 5 years,"Contrary to their claim of a 5 year warranty, these blades, while better than the old rubber style of blade, are NOT going to last 5 years, the best I got is two years before they started streaking. There was no abuse. I wrote Silblade via email to ask about the warranty and got NO REPLY. Amazon does not take returns on this type of product, I don't know why. I think Silblade should change their warranty and not claim 5 years as it is very misleading, if not an outright lie."
1,Very Disappointing,"... When I opened the box, one of the plastic instrument covers had already fallen off. Just looking at the station in person, I could see it was cheaply made, but I did set it outside for a test. The gauges are not accurate, particularly the humidity gauge, which consistantly registered way off. I immediately packed the thing back up for a speedy return.I might add that this is the only time I have ever been dissatisfied with the quality of any product sold by Amazon. I hope that they choose to carry a wall mount weather station of a higher quality in the future."
3,Not bad for home use,"The materials are a little cheaper than I expected, with liberal use of plastics. The accuracy seems okay. The thermometer seems quite accurate, but the other 2 change when the I tap the frame. The humidity guage was way off when I got it. The first test, putting it outside on a very humid day, caused it to go over 120%! It is very hard to adjust, with slight touches on the adjusting screws making very large guage changes, and after you let go, it immediately changes again.There are no included specifications to determine the supposed accuracy of the guages either. So it is better than others for home use, but not recommended for precision."
4,"Strong, Sweet Scent","This candle smells VERY sweet, sweeter than I'd expected. The wick burns fast and the flame gets high. Need to trim it after every use. I do like the crackling of the wood wick."
3,Candle,"Love , love , love the scent, burns nice BUT I thought I was getting away from the black smoke, Nope That was disheartening"
2,Woodwick Candle Cinnamon,I would not recommend this product because it smokes too much and it has too much crackling. Also the aroma is not very strong thus it does not provided the expected results.On the positive side the candle was delivered on time and without any damage and the jar is of high quality
2,48 hours,this candle burnt for only 48 hours. The sticker came off after burning it for only 2 hours and after that the jar was always sticky.
1,Not soy,"I was looking for a soy candle because I have a baby in the house and didn't want any fumes that could be harmful to her. When I first received this candle I was very happy with it and its scent. However, I was recently looking at the label on the candle, and no where on it does it say that it's a soy candle. I looked at this candle on a number of sites online, and amazon is the only one that says ""clean burning soy"" in its description. One of the other websites that sells this candle has a category for soy and ""eco-friendly"" candles, but this candle is not listed there - it's listed with their regular products. I believe that amazon's claim that this is a soy candle is a mistake.If you're looking specifically for a soy candle, don't buy this product. If you're looking for a regular scented candle, this is a fine product - it has a nice scent that is very pleasant and strong enough for a large room."
5,Daughter Loves This Film,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. She loves French and wanted this movie badly. She has watched it several times and seems to love it.
1,Barnett panzer V crossbow,Very inferior product with a famous brand name.The arrow retainer spring broke after only a few shots and the limb split ater about 25-30 shots. I am extremly disappointed with the cross bow ad wold never purchase this brand bow again.
2,Not So Hot,"This was the second ""Piano Tribute To Josh Groban"" album that I purchased.The Original one from 2004 was very pleasant to listen to, and the pianowork was excellent. To be perfectly honest, Josh Groban is a much more accomplished pianist than any of the individuals on this album. If I had known that before I purchased the album....I wouldn't have. While I can't call this album awful, it leaves much to be desired. If you're considering ordering it, save your money and invest it in real Josh Groban music."
5,Great Gift,"I bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend. He wore it regularly and it just recently ""broke"" (a pin came out that just needs to be taken to a jeweler to get fixed). I am highly satisfied with the quality of this product."
3,An excellent look,A&E does a fine job covering the important aspects of an unfathomable subject. There needs to be a piece on Michelangelo and a separate piece on his art. Such brilliance cannot be contained in one volume.
2,A lot smaller than it looks...,"And the thistle seed goes everywhere. NOT recommended -- too expensive and really, there are much better feeders out there."
4,Worth the price,"Seemed pricey at first but this feeder has been a source of amusement all summer. Small birds feed, play and sleep on it. Often jostling for position. Nice beveled top and routed base. Had a very wet few months but the feeder is holding up well. Squirrels don't even bother trying to get into it (but then they rarely get up the steel hanging plant stand our three feeders are on--lard or crisco mixed with cayenne pepper on the pole stops that after the first attempt)"
1,Unsafe,"Carrier is of very flimsy construction. At my first and only use the clips holding the bottom to the top of the crate gave way and separated, cat inside. Fortunately I was at my front door and cat ran in. I do not recommend this carrier. The older versions of Kennel Cab had screws holding the two parts together."
4,Good Crate,"I have a 5 month old 4.5 pound Maltese. He can stand up in this crate, and turn around nicely. I think that might still be the case when he is full grown (between 7-10 pounds). I wouldn't put a dog over 10-15 pounds in this crate for an extended period of time (i.e. all night long). For mine, it's a perfect sleeping crate. I just feel that by calling it ""intermediate"" it's a little missleading because to me it really is still quite small. This is, btw, his crate for when we're on the road sleeping other places. He has another crate for most every other night. This one is nice because of how easy it is to buckle in."
4,Love it but for the springs on the door,"This is a great cat carrier, and I have two of them.The only complaint I have is the spring latches on the door can spring off and fly away if you're not careful. If you squeeze at the wrong angle, they'll slip out of your grip and come out of the door altogether. Chasing the spring latch and a freaked out kitty is not fun.That said, I like the food/water dish that comes with the carrier, and the construction is good. I like that I don't have to shove the kitty in the front little door, that I can take the whole lid off and put it on over the cat."
1,NOT airline approved,"Buyer beware - apparently, these are NOT approved by all airlines, at least not for transport to Hawaii. We bought two of these to move our cats with us from CA to Hawaii. We chose these because they said airline approved, and had positive reviews. We even bought the darn air travel ""kits"" to go with them. Sadly, when we got to the airport for our one-way flight, United refused to accept the carriers, saying they don't accept carriers that have plastic fasteners!!!! My poor husband had to reschedule his flight, find a place to stay overnight that accepted pets, and find new carriers - and he had to do it with no car, just cabs. What a fiasco!!! Don't gamble on these if you are traveling with your pet. It just isn't worth the hassle - not to mention the extra stress that our cats had to endure!!!"
4,Just what we needed,"I knew the type of crate I wanted, I had borrowed this exact model from a friend when we got our puppy. It's perfect for crate training and for traveling. My only issue with it is that my four year old son keeps unlatching the side latches, so if you put the puppy in the crate and pick it up without checking, 1/2 of the crate will fall to the ground along with your pet. If you don't have a four year old who likes to ""undo"" everything, then it shouldn't be a problem!"
4,This is a Good Carrier,This is very nice and roomy for our little dog. I am happy with it. The little water and food hook on dish broke almost right away though. I have another one on a different carries and it is still good.
1,Don't Trust This Carrier!,"I purchased this carrier to help me transport my cats to their annual vet visit, and I assembled it according to the instructions provided. On the day of the vet appointment, I used it for my smallest cat (she weighs about 7 pounds). To my horror, it broke open when I lifted it from the car at the veterinarian's office! The terrified cat ran away from me, and it took over 20 minutes to get her out from under the car. I'm very lucky that she chose to hide under the car rather than running out into traffic. Even though I was using this carrier for a pet that weighs less than half of the recommended weight range for this product, the plastic tabs connecting the top and base sections did not hold together. Don't trust it with your pet!!!"
2,Bad design of door,"I have mixed feeling about this carrier. My biggest complaint is the kennel door - it is very easy for the door to fall off or open automatically when I am holding the handle on the top, because the weight of my cat (14 pounds) was pushing the bottom of the kennel (plastic) towards the ground. Eventually, I learned to hold the whole carrier with my arms on both sides to carry my cat around, which is extremely inconvenience because I can't open the non-automatic door in any veterinary hospital. As for the good side of the carrier (comparing to soft mesh carriers), it is chew-proof, it can hold a lot more weight (~25 pounds), good ventilation, easy to clean (it is plastic), and it is spacey so your pet can turn around in there. Overall, I give it 2 stars, and I really wish the manufacturer can fix that door/snaps problem."
4,Keeps 'em stuck real good.,"This is a great cage for carrying cats and small dogs. It's sturdy, nice colors, the latch works well. You might want to use some cable ties to reinforce the clamps though. Because if you have a fat animal and it gets rowdy, it might be a little upset when the cage opens from the bottom and its face is eating concrete."
3,"Nice cheap price, but quality is not top-notch","Locking latches are a bit flimsy, but price is right and good enough for light trips with small pets."
1,rejected,"I purchased this carrier specifically for pet air travel and was satisfied when reading it met USDA and IATA requirements. However, this carrier was REJECTED by the airline (Delta) who refused to allow it as an acceptable carrier! I'm extremely angry at Amazon for listing this carrier as ""approved for airline use"" and creating a significant and costly hurdle in the already complicated process of international pet relocation! Money wasted and customer seriously dissatisfied!!"
3,Satisfactory,"Purchased for our puppy that outgrew its last kennel. A little difficult to line up snap fittings, but once together it has stayed together. We've had one in another color for years with no problems. Our small dogs (9 & 13 Lbs) are kennel trained and stay in their kennels for hours at a time when we're running around. Only disappointment is the color in the title didn't match the photo or color in description (I should have called for clarification). Other reviewers have said airlines have refused to ship pets in these kennels, but I have previously flown with two dogs in identical kennels to Germany and return, with no problems. Perhaps the rules have changed."
1,cracked very easily,"this is the first review i have ever written on amazon. But i was compelled to write this because I was very upset at how easily the plastic construction of this Pet Kennel cracked. I tried to get in touch with the seller to see if I could resolve the situation, but there is apparently no way to contact this particular seller. I give this product zero stars....stay away."
1,DOG WILL ESCAPE,"*****DO NOT BUY**** I put my dog, an 11 month-old Lab mix, in this kennel overnight after he pottied in the house. I specifically checked that the locks were engaged before going to bed; they were. I put the kennel in another room for the night in case the dog whined. I awoke the next morning to a COMPLETELY DESTROYED room, because the dog got out of this kennel. This kennel has a terrible locking mechanism, if your dog has any wit HE WILL ESCAPE!!!!!!!!"
5,cross-country kitty,"Awesome carrier! Bought this carrier to ship my cat from Orlando to Honolulu and it held up wonderfully. The carrier does come with a shallow double tray, but I found it to be too shallow for water or food for this particular trip...not because my kitty needed that much food or water, but for the fear that it would get emptied with all the lifting and shifting of the carrier.In addition, my cat did urinate in the carrier (expected as he was in there for 20 hours), but a quick hosing took care of any overflow that the ""pee pad"" did not soak up.Pros:Light weightSturdyEasy to assembleEasy to cleanCons:Color of carrier was different from pictureRecommend placing zip ties through the connectors to ensure product doesn't come apartEverything considered, it was a great purchase."
3,Worth the money,"Our dog had outgrown its last (puppy) carrier and we found we needed something to occasionally contain her while we drove. I was not interested in paying a lot for something that would be used infrequently (at most), but I didnt want junk. This carrier has ""fit the bill"". Although it is not ""heavy duty"" construction, it is fine for our relatively calm 20 lb dog. It was easy to assemble ie latch the top half to the bottom half while fitting the door in place. Yes, that normally requires 4 hands but I found that I had as many of the necessary appendages to be succesful anyway. I'm not sure if it would stand up to daily ""hard use"" but for our needs it was worth the money and a better buy than the models at the local pet stores (at double the price)."
1,Worst Carrier Ever,"Something basically wrong with this product. The 3 pieces do not join/align properly. Snaps are not secure. Have had several of these carriers over the years, and this is the only one that did not 1. assemble easily and 2. stay togetherThe 2nd time I used it the bottom half dropped out with pet inside.Seems to want to come apart with use?Ridiculously bad - returning for refund with good riddance."
1,Dangerous to pet!,"Short and sweet.1. I am not an oversensitive pet owner.2. The crate that carries our <3 lb. Scoland terrier puppy should not fall apart.3. My dog doesn't like the shock of falling when the crate separates in half spilling contents, dog and all, to the floor. Even if it is just a foot or so.4. Clips to hold the two halves together....not a good idea, especially with this cheap flexible plastic.5. Yes, I will be returning this."
2,Pay for the real thing,"Not worth the savings, as you will need to pay for a new kennel. This Kennel Cab looks sturdier in the picture. My 15 pound Jack Russell bolted out of it at the vet's office. Another time the bottom gave out while carrying him up the stairs. The Petmate 21276 is made of soft plastic, the doors aren't sturdy nor dependable, and the latches don't stay latched. Don't buy this if you love your pet! In the end, you get what you pay for... and pay for your mistakes. I will need to order and pay more for the tried and true - for the sake and safety of my dog."
3,Slightly Disappointed,I ordered this carrier to use for vet trips for my adult cats. The size is good enough for one adult cat. I was disappointed in the construction of this carrier. The plastic is very flimsy. I am going to use the zip ties as recommended to secure the top and bottom pieces. I just won't be able to take the carrier apart if my kitty doesn't want to come out. I was hoping this carrier would have been a little larger and more well constructed.
3,It should work for small size pets,"I bought it for my American Eskimo pup, he was 7 punds at the time of purchase. Some how it didn't work for him, he panic inside and struggle getting out. The kennel seems pretty thin, it's cheapest in the list, you get what you pay for."
2,too flimsy and cheap,"I suppose you get what you pay for... This thing snaps together via 7 flimsy plastic hooks, and the handle isn't attached solidly enough. When I had my two bunnies in it (total weight ~10 lbs) I really felt like the thing was going to come apart. Would probably work fine if you are only transporting your pet from home to car and 50' to vet's office, but I wouldn't trust it to hold up any long distances. Plus, the food/water tray was a joke and didn't attach correctly. This one's getting returned."
2,Petmate 21276 Kennel Cab,"I own a Petmate kennel that's very similar to this one, but also has a second door that opens on the top of the kennel. I bought this one because it seemed pretty much the same, minus the second door. But this kennel is so much poorer quality.The plastic is thinner and weaker, so it buckles and bends easily under the weight of a 8lb cat. It feels like the two halves are going to fall apart. I'm not sure if this is because of the poor quality or just a bad accident; But the cage fell once and the small plastic latch (that holds the two halves together) next to the door broke, so now the kennel door does not stay securely shut.I just feel it's a very poor kennel over all and was a waste of my money."
2,Falls apart,"We have one of these and it's been a problem with dropping the bottom out. Three times, when the carrier had cats in it, the bottom dropped out. Once when going to the vet, it happened outdoors and the cats went running around outside. It could have been dangerous. It then happened gain twice inside the house as we were taking the carrier with the cats upstairs. We thought maybe it was human error in securing the cheap plastic latches. It wasn't.We now have packing tape around the carrier until the new one arrives from Amazon."
1,came apart at airport and cat got out!,"We were outside the airport and getting ready to load the crate into the car; a ton of traffic; noise and exhaust. Lifted up the crate and the entire top came right off. The bottom fell out and cat landed on the concrete. Instinctively I jumped on the cat and held it down while hubby rushed to reassemble the crate. We later used it to go to the vet, and had the exact same thing happen there. Maybe this one in particular is defective, but who wants to chance it? I've replaced it with another crate of the same brand but has the screws that hold the top and bottom together. That one never fails."
1,Very unsafe,"I ordered two of these carriers and was extremely disappointed. While they look very nice, I worked for hours trying to get the latches to lock in place and feel secure. When I finally had to use the carriers they fell apart multiple times once the weight of a pet and movement of carrying them was added. While the latches lock in place, they are very loose and obviously unsecure. We even had the vet tech at our veterinarians office attempt to put them together and she could not get them secure enough to stay latched once the carrier was picked up. I was extremely upset to have spent the money on these items ony to have them fall apart and puts my pets at risk for injury or running away as they were being carried outdoors to be taken to the vet and these are indoor animals. My cats have been declawed so if they had gotten loose from falling out of the carrier the outdoors would be extremely unsafe for them."
4,worth the money,"pros: been great for watching movies off laptop, hooked easily to my mac laptopcons: very white scenes can be washed out, could not make it work with Windows running via boot camp, hook up with RCA cables to my component DVD player looks awfuloverall: worth the cost"
1,Repeated failures,"ViewSonic has replaced my brand new PJ458D model projector three times, and the current one has also failed after 10-30 minutes. In each case, the lamp shuts down and cannot be restarted until it cools. Several times the fan also shut down with the lamp, shortening the life of the bulb. This has been frustrating to the extreme and the company has offered no explanation. I will not accept another of this model, nor recommend it to anyone."
1,What a mess - worst customer service I have ever experienced,"It worked for 15 minutes. Let it cool -worked 10 minutes. Let it cool several days-ran for a few minutes.Called ViewSonic May 5. It has been an ongoing mess since them. It is now August 28th. Without my approval they sent me twice the wrong model. Once they sent the right model, but it worked for 15 minutes. All the products are refurbished units. They have promised me this and that. I have been escalated. ""It's in the mail"" to death...I have been told they take inventory for the whole month of July. (Note: I have seen a complaint where the customer was told they do inventory for the whole month of December)They want me to pay the $20 shipping expense for a different model than I purchased. They have my money, my asset (Pj458D)...my money spent sending units back and I have ZERO, ZILCH, NADA. Any suggestions??????????"
5,Nashville strikes again.,"This is Buffy Sainte Marie at her best, particularly if you like country music."
5,"Readable, fascinating, with the right amount of information","This is a survey book--It has a chapter on each of several types of insects that have social or clustering behavior, but aren't the classic social insects, such as ants or bees. Some of the insects covered are butterflies, notably monarchs, locusts, and ladybugs. There is a fair, but not overwhelming, amount of information on each type of insect. The style is highly readable. I liked the book so much, I went and bought other of Waldbauer's books. Highly recommmended!"
4,a neat book,A pretty neat book. It gives you interesting insights into the insect world without being too techy. I didn't read it cover to cover but instead I pick it up when I'm wondering about an insect. It has insects that you'd encounter in everyday life which is helpful
2,Not what they say it is,I bought one of these knifes at the local sporting goods store so I thought I would purchase three more for gifts. The price was right and the picture is the same but when I recieved them they had 3 holes drilled on the back of the knife. They must be seconds.
5,"Compact, sharp, fast little American made EDC.","Compact, sharp, fast little American made EDC. Great size for the front pocket in jeans/shorts or your cargos. Came with a working edge as far as sharpness goes, cuts paper, boxes, just about anything cep't arm hair. A few strokes on a finishing stone or crock would do the trick, but I don't need a scalpel in my pocket, so I'm happy with the factory edge. Will be interesting to see how sharp it will get once it's time. Spring assist is great, and quick. Took a little getting used to using the thumb post, but after a few attempts, works great. Back blade assist is super quick as well, and a bit easier, but lacks the ""snap"" of the thumb post opening. Still, really fast assisted open...and American Made. Pretty nice. Highly recommend it. Will be ordering the next size up for camping/fishing for sure."
2,Decorative rain guage,This is a real pretty little gauge. It's all plastic and breaks really easily. It would be better if the stand were metal.
3,REPLACEMENT,"I like the rain gauge. My only disappointment is that I cannot find a replacement gauge. It has broken, but I would like to continue using it. I have tried stores around where I live, but no such luck. Does anyone now how to find them?"
3,Plastic,The plastic rain container is good in a warm climate but feels rather delicate. The support rod is somewhat flimsy and doesn't appear to be durable. It is attractive but appears low quality for the $$.
5,a much needed publication!,"I just finished reading ""The Tao of Beauty"" and I think it was a much needed publication. Many times I have looked for ways to grow or improve myself naturally, feeling as though my body is most responsive to elements that are of the Earth, and help my inside as well as my outside. Thank you [Helen] for taking the time to share your secrets and stories with others. It is much appreciated."
1,"Save your money, save your time, save your skin...","If I could give it zero stars, I would. While the ideas behind this book are intriguing, I can't recommend the actual recipes Ms. Lee gives for beauty and health--the ones for acne made my face break out even worse. Not to mention the ones that you take internally--the only one that I found remotely useful was the recipe for Honey Egg Milk. Leave out the egg and it's mighty tasty--but warm milk and honey is not what I'd consider a breakthrough. And her claim that a certain dish, ""Walnut Chicken Ding,"" improves your sex drive? It might be worth a try (it's just chicken with garlic and ginger), if it weren't so darned funny. I am sorry I wasted my money, and I'll be selling this one to a used bookstore--or pitching it in the recycle bin."
1,Spare your kids the suffering,"I ordered this for my younger brother who needed to read a book over the summer for his school. We picked this book because it seemed interesting but we were both very disappointed.I would describe this book as boring, dull, and overly pretentious. The most exciting part of the book was finishing it. I'm not one to read books that do not interest me, but I had to finish this one because I told my little brother that I would.Don't buy it if you love your kids."
3,"Lousy writing, fascinating subject","Ok, so we're spoiled.My family just readThe Notorious Benedict Arnold: A True Story of Adventure, Heroism & Treachery""The Notorious Benedict Arnold,"" a masterpiece of well-written history and suspense.This book... is merely adequate.The writing style is reminiscent of nothing so much as those mediocre-at-best ""wicked history"" books.Genghis Khan: 13th Century Mongolian Tyrant (Wicked History)Hannibal: Romes Worst Nightmare (Wicked History)Vlad the Impaler: The Real Count Dracula (Wicked History)Mao Zedong (Wicked History)Such an interesting topic deserves better -- MUCH better. Too bad -- this could have been very, very entertaining."
3,For the Revolutionary War enthusiast there is nothing better!,"When George Washington stepped into the position of General, the tide turned. ""There is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate a designing enemy and nothing that requires greater pains to obtain."" - George Washington. This book proves that statement on many accounts.This book is crafted in a clever style that makes the book impossible to summarize. It relates to the reader the exact intelligence used and devised by Washington to win countless battles during the revolutionary war.The book pulled me into it amazingly far as non fiction was never an interest of mine let alone the revolutionary war. I loved how it was explained in such detail, relating the accounts yet holding my attention. Sort of. As I have already stated, I do not enjoy reading about the revolutionary war. So I did not enjoy the book as much as I would have other genres. But I would recommend this book to any enthusiast of the Revolutionary War."
5,"""Without You"" by Touch, need I say more...?","Mr. Vega has a definite ear for Spanish inflected dance music and this album dishes it out in spades. Among the numerous highlights there's ""Without You"" by Touch (a tough NYC house classic), ""Din Daa Daa"" by George Kranz, one of the earthiest mixes of Cymande's ""Bra"" that I have ever heard and a whole host of other tight tracks on the two discs included in this package...."
4,It's 20 minutes,"The title of the dvd is BASIC pilates. This dvd is not trying to sell anything but basic body form for this type of exercise. If you have not done any type of exercised in a while and want a gentle way to get back into something, try this for 20 minutes. Yes it is a bit cheesey, but I think the instructor gives same basic good tips that my live instructor of 5 months has not given me. Check it out from your public library first, then decide. I am going to try it more than once before I take it back to the library. I am ready for something more advanced and longer than 20 minutes."
5,Outstanding Plasma product,"I purchased this Plasma T.V. before christmas, The shipping time was exactly what they quoted when I ordered. The Television itself is so much better than everyone else says it is. My wife and I are extremely happy about this purchase. You wont find a better plasma television for the price of these. The sound is not as bad as alot of reviews have said it is. It does come out of the back like all the reviews says it does, but I think that the sound is still really good with or without some additional sound system. The picture quality is great and the Television itself looks great. I will probably be buying another one of these tv's for my bedroom really soon.."
4,Outstanding EDTV for the Price,"I received this TV about a month ago, and other than a small problem with the supporting feet being bent during shipment, I have not had a single problem. Use it in our master bedroom, and am amazed at the color and brightness this TV offers. Have it connected to a Dish Network 942 HDTV receiver, and the HD channels look incredible even though it isn't an HDTV. Using Component Video cables to receiver, and cannot stop watching Discover HD channel. Audio is fine for our bedroom, but I can see if it where in a large family room it wouldn't get loud enough. Shortly after purchasing this TV Amazon lowered the price and I was pleased to find that they gave me the difference of the price back to me when I called to ask why the price was dropped shortly after purchase. That being said, if you want a truly budget TV, then this is your sure thing."
3,Beware,"For the first 8 months the TV was fine, then one day I turn the TV on and the green power light comes on for about 2-3 seconds and goes right back to the red standby light. Not picture or anything comes on either. I have the protection plan but it been 2 months and my TV is still not fixed."
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!,"Why can't we rate this with zero stars? One star is far too many! Our story is just about identical to many that have been reported here. One day about a month ago there was a loud POP and the TV just stopped working. Unfortunately we didn't pay $600 for it, we paid $1200 in April '06! Funai/Sylvania should be shut down and we do plan on writing letters to the Attorney General, reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and contacting our Congressman to ask for a congressional investigation into this company. Someone needs to start a class-action lawsuit here. We also got the run around about them sending us a box. We made several calls, talked to supervisors and their supervisors and got no help whatsoever. I cringed when I read the great reviews that some have given this TV who have only owned it a few months. I wish them luck. We, also thought it was great and the picture was beautiful until without warning it turned into a piece of junk! Don't buy it!"
1,You Get What You Pay For.,"I bought this tv in December and it has never worked properly. The tv emits a high pitched electrical hum that will give you a headache within a few minutes. I had the tv ""repaired"" under warranty (this took over 2 months). When they returned the tv to me, it still had the same issue, so they came back to my house and picked it up (that was 3 months ago), and I still don't have it back. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and asked my credit card company to refuse payment. This tv, and Sylvania/Funai Corp are worthless."
4,So much for so little,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this set at such a drastically reduced price. We'd been talking about getting a larger TV for the wall, but weren't ready for the extra costs associated with HDTV through Direct TV. Then we learned about EDTV and thought we'd give it a whirl - couldn't be more thrilled! The only problem is that I can't get my husband away from the set! Buyers should be aware that the remote control is not useful by itself. There are no numbers on it for channel selection and must be used with another box/remote, in our case satellite TV. Aside from that, this was a wonderful compromise."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I would give this NO stars if possible. This product is nothing but a piece of junk. After 4 months power went out and never came back on. It has been a month and am still waiting for Funai corp. which is sylvania to take care of this. They ignore you and will not return phone calls. Quite frustrating but I will not give up. Totally aggravating but like a previous review stated, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. It is a real PIECE OF ----. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Sylvania Plasma Display,"Low Price - Great picture - poor speakers. Failed after about 13 months of occasional use with a loud ""POP"" sound. Warrenty for parts and labor is 90 days, for parts is 1 year, for display is 3 years. Sylvania was unsympathetic. Low price, but pretty expensive for only 13 monts of use."
4,"Not an HDTV, but MUCH better than my OLD TV!","I purchased this EDTV in December 2006 and have LOVED it since day 1!!I was looking for a 42"" HDTV, and those were priced around $2000.00. I just happened to stumble across this for $699.99, with free shipping! I thought it was to good to be real! Well I WAS WRONG! It was everything I thought and MORE! Almost a year later the prices of HDTV's have fallen. I am happy with my EDTV, but now that the prices have dropped so much, I might get an HDTV, take my EDTV from my living room and move it to my bedroom and put the HDTV in my living room.This was a GIANT step up from the traditional analog TV, for ALOT less than an HDTV!!A great buy for a step (leap) up! The HDTV prices will continue to fall, so MAYBE you want to wait more and get the EDTV for now?September 2010TV is ALMOST FOUR years old, no problems and still LOVING it! Now that the prices have dropped SO MUCH, wanting to upgrade to a 50"" 1080, but finding it hard to give up my sylvania!"
4,I love it!,"Six months and I'm still in love with this TV. Some people mentioned having to pay shipping and handling, but I didn't have to do that. So I paid a total of about $900. The picture quality for HD channels is great---clear, crisp, distinctive colors and gives you an almost ""there"" feeling. As another reviewer mentioned the sound isn't that great, but for the TV sound that's fine and only a bit of a problem when I listen to music. Another minor issue I have is that the screen seems to continually have marks on it that only show when the TV is off. Other than that I think I got an absolutely wonderful bargain. Other TVs I priced for this size were $400 to $700 more."
4,Very good deal!,"For the price this is a great tv. The audio from the rear speakers is ok, but that is the only thing I can say is unsatisfactory. I have owned this product for several months and am very pleased with it's performance. The picture with HD signal is awesome! Also I have a progressive scan DVD player and it looks beautiful. I've had people comment on how good it looks. My Brother wanted to know when I got the HD DVD player, he was shocked that it was not an HD player. You won't be dissapointed with this product or the price.BK"
3,MY 42 INCH PLASMA,This television is pretty good for the 699.99 that I paid for it.The sound is not great. I hooked up a souround sound system to mine.The picture is pretty good! I am pretty happy with this television.
3,A Different Approach,"I enjoyed this book. I've read several others on temperaments. Perhaps Ms. Williams takes the wrong teacher's path as mentioned in the previous reviewer, but some of her perspectives are unique and interesting. I especially liked the explanation of temperaments going through 3 stages, depending on maturity levels, and what happens when one doesn't progress. Plus she explains at length combined temperaments, which is a help. So much of what I've read explains the simple choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic and sanguine without explaining what happens when one has two or more of these combined. I wouldn't use this book as the ONLY reference for understanding temperaments, but I would include it as another perspective."
1,Where is Hippocrates ?,"Makes a good start but un fortunatly is quickly reduced to yet another self-help-others pap publication. Xandria makes a few fundamental errors. She uses the Galenic interpretations of the Hippocratean temperament and constitutions, unfortunatly Galen was an anatomist and a reductionist, his vociferous version plagued us for 1500 years, and still does today. She also fails to mention the full use of this theory, it's not simply for counselling but is a diagnostic and treatment gem. Please don't be led by this small view of constitutions, look to Hippocrates himself (available on the web for free.)"
5,Outsmart Your Cancer,"It's incredible the amount of excellent information in this book. A must read for anyone, with cancer or who knows someone with cancer, who is looking for a better & non-toxic way to help cure themselves."
4,Thinking outside the square,This is a really good book for anyone interested in exploring alternatives and additions to conventional medical therapy for cancer.
2,Some informative stuff - but not the best,"I am currently studying in a naturopathic program and am constantly purchasing new books on alternative health, not just for cancer, but other disorders. That being said, I have accumulated quite a library. After reading this book, though it has some worthwhile info in it, I have several other books that are far better, written by alternative health physicians or nurses who are more qualified to discuss these topics and have more experience dealing with cancer patients. They also have a great deal more information in them. This book leaves out some really important up-to-date treatments, though it does cover some of the older remedies."
3,Living with cancer,Very interesting how cancer medicine gets or does not get accepted for use in curing cancer. There was very little about Hodgkins which I was interested in.
5,Outsmart your Cancer,"Excellent source!!!!!!!! For any one who has some type of cancer, this is a must to have. Purchase this book and you will not be dissappointed. There are facts you need to know and other treatments could possibly help you and your family."
4,Best source on alternative cancer cures that work,This a wonderful source for alternative cancer cures that actually work. Sorts out all the crazy cures listed on the internet into what is actually a viable cure and what is only helpful in some cases. Seems well researched.
5,"Great book; lots of helpful insight, as to how to cope, and handle this dreaded disease that I have succumbed to.","Lot's of helpful tools & advice given, to be as healthy as possible, in fighting cancer. It gave me hope that I too can be a survivor."
5,My Life With Protocel,Outsmart Your Cancer: Alternative Non-Toxic Treatments That Work (Second Edition)With CDCancer detected in right lung during routine physical in June 2006. Subsequent MRI found mets in a tonsil and on left side of neck. Biopsies on lung and neck defined non-small-cell carcinoma. Began taking Protocel every six hours in August. The neck cancer began to 'soften' by early October - other cancers not accessible. Surgeon told me neck cancer was 6 cm long and tonsil cancer about 3cm diameter. Neck and tonsil operated on 11 October - lung inoperable. Examination of material removed showed a 1 cm cancer in neck and less than 1 cm in tonsil - both inbedded in a mass of yellow gel. Got radiation to neck and lung for 30 - 35 treatmenrs in Jan-Feb 2007. Five years later have been pronounced cured.Thanks be to Protocel.
4,Good Info,"I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. I decided to be empowered and gather as much info on treatment including alternative treatments. This book is quite informative and has given me comprehensive information that I would probably not have obtained from any other resource. I would recommend that any one who is facing the experience of cancer, read as much as you can on conventional and alternative treatments, and of course, make your own independent, personal and INFORMED decision. May you have the best outcome on your road to recovery."
1,tribute? What a joke!,"How can they call this a tribute? It's an INSULT to IZ! It sounds awful! Don't waste your money on these riduculous, amateur vocals. I would also give it zero stars if I could. Your money is much better spent buying an actual IZ CD. I recommend Facing Future."
1,A HAWAIIN TRIBUTE TO ISRAEL KAMAKAWIWO'OLE,Hi! This CD is without interest! It's not the Great Israel. I already ordered this item when I read the commments. Don't spend your money in this CD!Danièle
5,Great game!!,"GReAt GaME!!From An 8 year oLd gamer: Very good Game.If you buy it you MightSay, "" CooL! it deserves 5Stars!"" PLUS it's got a stunt course and a battle course (but for 2-4 players, or so the manual said). PLUS there's circuit race, practice, single race, a few cars to choose from, a fog feature and wind.I would recommend this to anyone."
5,one of the best games I have ever played for N64,"This is a very fun game. The stunt, battle, and obstacle modes are my favorites. I like games in which you use weapons and items to beat your opponents. Obstacle mode is tough, but you get good at it after awhile. The only thing I don't like is that I can't find it at ANY STORE!"
2,not as good as the other rush,this rush has really dark graphic on my tv. half the time i can not see my car. it also has some battle mode but it gets boring after 10 mins of picking up the same weapons over and over and half the time i end up falling off a ledge and losing the weapon i just picked up. there are no deaths like in the other rush so if you push a car into the wall it just keeps going. i would give this a 1 star rating but it is a little fun but not much.
1,This game rules! .. not,"I found this game to be very frustrating. you start out with 1 stunt track which is pretty boring . and thenn your supoossed to unlock stuff, like ore stunt tracks, which is a pain in the neck unless you like making attempt after attempt to get the stupid gold coins or whatever they are. I don't reccommend that you buy this game you will only find it frustrating and dissapointing."
5,Simply Amazing!,What a game. This is the best Rush yet. Midway does it again. This game will keep you coming back for more and more. It's almost impossible to stop.
1,"No Signal, flimsy construction",This item gave no reception even when pressed up against a window. The frame and stand fell apart about 5 minutes after assembly.
2,Uses Thinner RG-59U Cable,"Despite the box saying the antenna cable connection was RG-6, mine had the thinner RG-59U cable. Satellite television installers started using the thicker RG-6 to better transmit the digital signals. Cable companies followed suit. Why this antenna uses RG-59U to send digital signals to a television, I can only guess. It can't be to save money, as the cost difference for the six-foot cable is a few pennies. Maybe they ran out of RG-6 and found an old spool of RG-59U. For whatever reason, the use of this thinner cable to transmit digital signals cripples it's ability to deliver a stable signal.One of these days I'll thin out the end of the proper cable and replace the original cable, but meanwhile, I purchased a Radio Shack antennaAntenna/hdtv/fm Hd Radio Indoorthat works better for half the price."
2,Hit or miss,"When it works, it works better than the amplified Terk antenna that I originally bought. Actually picked up more channels than the Trek.When it flakes, it flakes hard. It's goes to 60% on ,40% off for no apparent reason...clouds?...passing traffic?...who knows. This can often last for 30 minutes at a time.I've gone back to the Trek just because it is more consistent, even though we have to switch over to the analog signal for ABC, and it's signal has a tendency to pixelate more frequently, just not as prone to complete drop-outs.I live just outside of Downtown Dallas, so our signal strength is pretty good. This unit will hopefully be good enough for a second set when we move next summer... or maybe I'll finally give in and get cable..."
1,Did Not Live Up To Expectations,The antenna performed worse than my existing antenna & I was very disappointed by it.
1,Worthless Frames,"I ordered three of thesse hoping to avoid using a cable box on some extra tv's. The price was good and they arrived promptly. But, that's where it all ended. The construction is cheap. The frame is held together with no more than on flat nail per corner. It fell apart while pulling out of the box. More importantly the reception was very poor. Now this is living about ten miles from the Empire State Building. I returned them all. Forunately, my money was refunded promptly."
3,Not ab Fab but an interesting variation.,"To say that P.R is a Canadan version of Ab Fab is not quite true. The main character - Alex Reid - runs a successful P.R firmas does Ab Fab's Edina Monsoon. The characters, however, are mainly younger and the ocus is on the P.R businss, rather than including he generational blame game stroy line in Ab Fab. There is also a Sex in the City-esque air added by some romantic plots.Overall, the characters are large, the story frenetic and it is a good variation on the Ab Fab theme."
3,Nice product,I used this product on my sensitive skin and it was great. BUT the smell was pretty off. I probably wouldn't buy it again.
4,Another great Sony product,"Great product. If you're a gadget fiend as I am, then you'll have no problems figuring out how to use it. The ""Quick"" documentation is terrible, but readable.The PC configuration of the base station is a lot better than the one that's formatted for the PSP. If you do install, install the PC first if at all possible.Quality of the picture is great on the PSP, but lacking on the computer. It could feed better resolution to PCs but it lacks the support. It also wouldn't be bad if the player could support Mac/Linux. The PC player GUI is terrible looking but functional. PSP one is sharp and works like a charm.As usual with Sony, the design of the box is superb. Very sleek looking. Could use some work in better functionality, but it's nothing some firmware updates couldn't solve if they got around to it."
1,Very Poor Quality on a PC,"I bought this unit because I wanted a small TV in a room where I had no connection to my Dish-TV receiver. Rather than trying to run cable to the room, this seemed like an interesting alternative.I was a little concerned about quality, but the unit broadcasts over 802.11g, and I thought that should be plenty of bandwidth.However, the quality of the image I get looks like something you would download from the internet. From a long distance, it looks good, but from up close there are tons of compression artifacts and faces are hardly recognizable. If this is what it looks like directly over wireless-G, I can't imagine what it would like like if I tried to look at it across the WAN.You probably wouldn't notice the poor picture on the small screen on a PSP, so I would guess it would work well for that. However, don't by this product expecting to get a decent picture on a computer monitor."
1,Wasn't the best for the price,"I don't have a psp which I heard this works great for, but it was also supposed to be good for watching TV on the computer. My problem was that it was 280 dollars and then I had to buy a 100ft wire to connect to my router. Then you could not watch the TV once it was connected since my dish only has one input and sony did not have in output. Slingbox is much better, easy to install, constantly updates their software, you are able to watch the TV and the TV on the computer and was 80 dollars cheaper.For regular viewing of the TV at remote locations I highly recommend the Slingbox over the Sony Locationfree. I was able to go to bermuda and had no trouble seeing my TV back home and never missed any of my shows when it was paired with my TIVO. Now that I have my own apartment at school it works wonders cause I use the slingbox at my parents house and don't have to worry about getting cable in my apartment for extra costs, just got internet."
2,waste of money,This doesnt work very well & we never ended up using it! (interferred with our wireless internet )
1,Don't Buy This Product,Please don't buy the Location Free Player from Sony!!! They charge money for each of their software player that you put on your computer with a license key... It sucks... Not only that they don't support Vista. I called their tech support and they told me to buy a LocationFree Player software that supports vista for an extra $29 because my model is over one year old. I never hear a company that doesn't support a driver just because it's over one year old!Don't make the mistake that I made and buy this product. Buy the SlingBox! The software is free and you can download it from there homepage... If you don't believe me research this by yourself.Here is the proof:[...]
1,Not able to pick up stations in Japan,"I purchased the Sony LocationFree device in 2006. I am working in Japan with the Military. The device was sold locally at our Military Exchange. I hooked the system up to my television in the states as well as downloaded the software onto my computer. Once, my computer arrived to Japan, I received error messages. The Sony people were not able to assist me and I wasted over $300 for the LocationFree device, shipping and handling, phone calls, and my stateside cable bill and internet."
3,Remote IR Blaster Burned Out,"I had 2 remote IR blaster burn out on me from this unit. I tried returning to Amazon but they did not have any in stock. I contact Sony and they sent a return box right away to me. I haven't received it back yet. But hopefully, they were able to fix it.Overall, I like this unit. I was able to watch tv on my PSP and 1 PC. It only allows one unit at a time to use the connection. Additionally, you have to buy additional licenses if you want to install the software and use it on more than 1 pc. (PSP doesn't require a separate serials)"
5,Dog And Beths Wedding.,"I'm a fan of all the Dog The Bounty Hunter Tv Series, it is a joy to watch dog, beth, leland, and lyssa in action."
1,Beautifully crafted. Would make a good paperweight.,"I understand this was a mild northeast winter, but I'm fairly sure the temperature dipped below 20 degrees. You wouldn't know it from this item which seems to register temps between 20 and 50 degrees only. Since this thermometer was designed to measure only the temperature, I'd have to say its inability to do so has limited its usefulness. Very pretty though!"
3,Helpful but basic.,"The book is basic in its approach to elder caring. Because the book is written by fourteen different people it is repedative in areas. This book completely ignores the wonderful counsel of daily Bible reading and prayer in elder care giving. My Mother suffering with Alzheimer's, loves to have the Bible read to her. ""What a friend we have in Jesus""."
1,Treo form Fit Case,"The ""form fit"" lost it's grip after a few weeks. After my treo phone crashed to the ground a second time, I decided to stop using it before my phone endured and irreparable damage. For me it was a complete waste of money."
5,Love this Birdbath,We have had this birdbath for many years (8?) and it still looks great. The birds seem to like the shallow bowl. The company has been terrific when I have called to request replacement misters that have been lost. They send them promptly and FREE. Great buy.
1,Wrinkled,These sheets came out of the dryer looking like they went through a wringer! they are loose fitting and I have a pillow top mattress. WOuld not buy or recommend
3,Classic Collection Marvin Gaye.,When I purchased this item I truly thought i was getting a Box set with added extra's instead this set is 4 Classic CD'SDisc 1 is Trouble ManDisc 2 is Let's Get it OnDisc 3 is I Want YouDisc 4 is Love Starved Heart.It's an excellent collection for some one who is just starting out other than that for those hardened Marvin Gaye fan's it's not worth the money i paid. In fact i bought all 4 albums for less than the Box set is priced.
5,Mind boggling!,I read this compilation of turn of the century comic strips by someone who had a unique genius - you read the story told by the strip...then turn it upside down and the story continues...with those same pictures transformed into new pictures which make sense in the continuing story. Has to be seen to be believed. Fun for any age. Quite a conversation piece.
5,Excellent,"Iam very interested in getting the volumes 5 and 6 of ""Caballo de Troya"". Please let me know how or where I can get them. Your Philosophy made a radical change in my life."
5,Si no es verdad... debes estar muy cerca ...,"A : ""J.J.BENITEZ"".Gracias a DIOS por habernos entregado la oportunidad de conocer tus obras y que por medio de tus maravillas podamos acercarnos mucho mas a EL. Quiero aclarar que no pertenezco a ninguna religion solo pertenezco a DIOS,donde sea que EL este, y sin saber aun si tus ""Viajes"" fuerón reales o no, la veracidad con que narras los hechos es tan perfecta y detallada que me cuesta creer que de no ser real puedas tener tanta imaginación. Te felicito por tan magnifico trabajo. No nos abandones Jason... Seguimos esperando por ti."
5,A trully eye-opener,"I can't wait to read the next edition! J.J, if you're reading this, I'm from Brasil... Please don]t take to long to whrite the next!!!"
5,Magnifico,"Este libro es interesante desde la pagina 1 hasta el final,sea o no sea ficcion,este libro nos ensena a recordar y comprender que un gran hombre o hijo de dios como el se proclamo hace 2 mil anos,dejo como mensaje para toda la humanidad. Lealo y no se arrepentira!!"
5,Has J.J. Benitez the right to make a novel out of this?!!,"I think that if there's at least 50% truth to the project to which the book refers to, then J.J. Benitez has no right to make it into a novel. A good writer who'd never written a novel before decides to take some very serious information (if it really exists)and turn it into his first novel. Instead of publishing the real information. Like I've said, if such a project really took place and some people have lost their lives over it, and it's of the magnitude described in these books, I think it deserves not only to be treated with respect but also to be presented in its original format, which would have the results that might have originally been intended by its author. J.J. Benitez, if you read this, please go a step forward and either verify or deny the existence of such documents. If it happens to be true, you should ammend yourself by publishing the real documents."
5,Leer este libro impacta a la vida,"Sr. J.J. Benitez le quiero expresar cuan reconfortante ha sido leer la serie de libros Caballo de Troya, nos ha enseñado un poco mas de ese sublime personaje que es Jesús de Nazareth y al mismo tiempo, me ha enseñado otra forma de conocer a Dios y su real mensaje al mundo, lo cual me ha hecho ver la vida desde otra óptica, con menos temores y con mas ganas de ser uno mismo y luchar por lo que uno siente realmente, por nuestra búsqueda personal. Lo felicito y no nos haga esperar mucho por Caballo de Troya 6."
4,INTERESANTE E INCREIBLE.,"El libro indudablemente cambio mi vida porque ha descrito a un Jesucristo que realmente muestra su lado humano y divino a la vez. Lo que lo hace un poco dificil de leer son las numerosas notas tecnicas que justifican el ""viaje a traves del tiempo"". Aunque dificil en ese sentido, le da credibilidad pues muchos de los inventos descritos en el libro ya son de uso comun hoy en dia. Supongo que lo que resta hacer es pedirle a J.J. BENITEZ que se apure con el resto, suplicando encarecidamente que se convierta en la ultima parte. Ha sido agonizante esperar por tanto tiempo para el final, FINAL. Estoy de acuerdo con algunos otros lectores, en que el libro # 5 ya parecia mas inverosimil dentro de lo inverosimil que es toda la historia. Independientemente de todo ello, ya sea novela de ficcion o trate de describir una realidad, el hecho es que tiene el poder de cambiar la vida espiritual de muchos de nosotros."
2,Tan solo MARAVILLOSO !!!!,"Sr.Benitez sus Libros me han abierto a un mundo nuevo, donde me hace sentir sentimientos encontrados que es la religión clasica que existe de hace varios años y lo nuevo que de repente hace dudar si es verdad o manetira. Tan solo el tiempo o la circunstancias de la vida nos iran desengañando o suminirnos en nuestra propia decepción. Gracias y espero algún día conocerlo aunque sea por la via del E-mail. Saludos, Joe W. Retamal A."
2,That's J.J.! - Ese es J.J.!,"I can't understand what happened to the history in fifth volume, It turned into many completely unbeliveable situations, not only about the ""techno-magical"" events he describes, but about the argument too it has many failures. (Why they had money problems if they can materialize all what they want?). It not makes much sense. His obssesion about force readers to continue buying ""The next book"", turned me in a bad mood!No comprendo que le pasó a la historia en su quinta entrega, se convirtió en algo lleno de situaciones completamente increibles, no sólo por los eventos ""tecno-mágicos"" que describe, sino también por el argumento que tiene serias fallas. (Porqué tenían los protagonistas problemas de dinero si podían materializar lo que quierieran?). No tiene nucho sentido. Su obsesión por forzar a los lectores a leer la siguiente entrega me disgustó mucho."
5,Magnífico,"Fue tal la pasión que se generó en mi corazón cuando finalicé este libro, que al leer el epílogo sentí una profunda decepción. Necesitaba creer que todo lo que había encontrado allí era verdad. Pero después supe que sí, que la verdad está de alguna manera suscrita, pues J.J. logra que el amor que él mismo profesa a Jesús llegue a cada uno con la misma intensidad. El viaje, Jasón, la madre, la NASA, los artefactos...no importa si son fantasía. Pero no me caben dudas de que si a mí me preguntaran si quisiera viajar en el tiempo para conocer a Jesús, mi respuesta sería SI absolutamente. Las consecuencias no pueden ser otras que volver a El, en un eterno retorno. Después de este libro, y de los 5 que le siguen, ahora estoy a la caza del 7...debe estar por salir."
5,Excelente lectura,"La imaginaci?n y detalle de este libro, me marco para siempre. La emoci?n que me influyo en las ?ltimas p?ginas del libro fueron grandiosas. De verdad, si la historia es una fantas?a entretenida o existe alguna peque?a verdad en ella, no deja de ser una grata y apacible lectura de este libro."
5,CUANDO LA FICCION SE HACE REALIDAD,"Me parece fabulosa la narracion de Jason en su viaje en el Tiempo a la epoca de Jescristo, estoy seguro de que a muchos de los lectores les dejara una sed de leer las siguientes partes. No hay dudas de que mucho de lo escrito tiene logica y nos esta lejano de la verdad"
2,Not as good as the others,"This part four of the ""Caballo de Troya"", is not as good as the other ones. Actually it's kind of boring, because the plot is focused only on things that Jason was told, instead of things he saw, or experienced. And the end of the book it's too sudden, it's like the author just decided to finish it without giving it sense."
1,j.j benitez,"señor j.j.benitez solo hago este comentario porque me parece interesante la obra que ha escrito porque bueno,yo le habia tomado otro perfil de lo que realmente se perfila en su obra ,pero vaya que me equivoque solo he comenzado a leelo pero por lo poco que llevo de lectura me parecio interesante felicitarlo porque me ha hecho reflexionar mas aun sobre mi postura acerca de la realidad exacta de la existencia del que yo digo es mi padre y me refiero a cristo asi que despues volvere a escribir cuando lo haya terminado porque gracias ala carrera que estoy estudiando quiero hacer un ainvestigacion de la religion y creo que su libro me sera de mucha ayuda gracias."
1,Awful,"An unprofessionally written book. It offers nothing that other, better written books haven't said before. After reading the previous customer's review, I find it hard to belief that they even read the same book I did."
5,awesome lure,"I bought a rapala skitter pop in lime frog and it has not ceased to amaze me and im sorry if i have misspellings.pros of the skiter pop:highly durablegreat hookscaught my biggest bass on it (4 pounds 19"")works when nothing else doescons:very light weight lure so it doesnt cast very far with heavier line.easily hangs up on lilly padspretty expensiveover all this is a great lure and i highly recomend this lure!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I SHOULD RECEIVE THIS FILM WITH PORTUGESE TEXTS,"IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT THAT I COLLECT THESE FILMS OF ESTHER WILLIAMS AND VAN JOHNSON, WHICH WITH THIS BEING UNAVAILABLE IN IT'S ORIGINAL FORM, I HAVE KEPT IT, BUT IT TAKES AWAY THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THIS FILM,AND IN FACT THE COVER IS ALSO IN PORTUGESE - MAYBE A MISTAKE?PLEASE LOOK INTO IT, AS I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME FILM IN PORTUGESE!"
3,My website made it to the book!,"Unlike the professional book reviewers, I actually found this book when I was doing a Google search for myself. My website is 'reviewed' so I figured I would buy the book and read the review.Hence, my review of this book will not be a re-write of the dust jacket.The write-up of my website (store) is pretty much what I would expect from a teenager reviewing websites: sarcasm. Reminds me of being young. I like that. I was a bit like the author when I was younger so I forgive him for his summation of my website.Still, I bought the book and showed my whole family. They all either laughed hysterically (the men) or took personal affront (the women) to the authors words.I, of course, laughed."
5,Great Function and Design,"This weather station is the bomb! I purchased one a long time ago and the thing hasn't failed with predicting the weather. I have it up in my cabin in the mountains and I always know if it is going to rain or snow a day or two before.If you're looking for a durrable and reliable weather station, with a modern look, then this is it."
2,amazon ripped me off,well i never even got to hear this product because amazon sent me a broking one and would not replace it so just for everyone out here be carefull on what u buy from amazon they dont like to replace your items or help you get a new one
2,EVEN WORST THAN DEFAULT ANTENNA !!,"The signal goes down, I buy this to increase my reception, but even at outside, the signal is worst than with normal antenna. Don't buy !!La señal se cae, compre esto para incrementar mi recepcion, pero aun estando afuera, la señal es peor que con la antenna normal, no lo compres !!"
2,This flavor wasn't enjoyed,Personally I found this bar similar to finding prunes spread beneath a layer of chocolate on top of a tasteless bar. I love Genisoy bars (and give this 2 stars) except for this particular flavor.
2,Birds liked it too well...They destroyed it in a month!,"I bought this bird feeder and had to throw it away within a month! The birds in my area liked the holes on the bottom the best and pecked the holes even bigger. Within a month, all the bird feed would just pour out those larger bottom holes and the feeder could hold no feed at all. The wood was beautiful, but too soft to be practical."
2,"Nice looking, but no birds!","This feeder is very pretty and attractive, but for some reason the birds never came to it. We have several feeders in our yard, and the birds are at the feeders all day long. We hung this one up, but the birds never came to it - not even the house sparrows!"
2,squirrel feeder,Squirrels chewed through the holes and rendered the feeder virtually worthless within 2 days.
5,Great product,The knife was exactly what I wanted/ needed for a perfect Valentine's day gift ! I couldn't find it at any local stores and it arrived on the day I needed it! Perfect working condition! No problems at al! I was completely satisfied with my purchase.
2,Not as good as the larger models,"I have the Kershaw speed bump, which I love. This knife was a disappointment, the assisted opening is inferior. It will not pop the blade all the way out, you still need to use your hand to extend the blade until it locks into place. I assumed because its blade size was have the size of my knife, that the knife would be, yeah, half the size. But no, it was 1/4 the size at best. I sent this product back."
5,excellet on all levels,"this is the most impressive small knife i have ever owned.. i have 5-6 spring assisted knives and this is the best of all for overall quality.. i also own a kershaw scallion spring assited knife.. a little larger and another total winner.. both are very high quality.. razor sharp , fast action . a pleasure to own.."
5,Dynomite,"I purchased this Kershaw Ken Orion Rainbow Chive Pocket knife for my wife. She has never had nor would she ever buy a nice well made pocket knife on her own. After reading reviews from several locations, I thought this would be the perfect knife for her. Well; she received it a week or so ago and absolutely loves it. She was so proud of it, she even showed it off at work to her all female co-workers whom also really liked it.My wife has never been into anything as it relates to weapons and/or knives, However; this knife is perfect: for a good looking, well made, smaller profile utility/carry knife. This one is the ticket. Good Job on this model. and thanks"
5,follow up,no sooner than than I wrote my review about not being able to close I found the mechanism to allow it to close duh! anyway i upped the review to 5 stars to balance the 3 to 4. If that makes sense :-)
3,Sharp but small,"I purchased this knife to replace a larger sized knife from the same manufacturer. I opened the box and found that the knife is super tiny. I have small hands, and the knife (fully extended) stretches from the top of my pinkie to the base of my wrist, but it is very narrow - about the width of my pinkie."
1,Could not play on XP,I tried everything I could do and checked everywhere on the internet to figure out how to load and play this game on XP. I could find no patches and all the directions and changes I made on my computer didn't help. I couldn't even get it to load. What a dispointment. I have played lots of older games but could always figure out how to get them to load and play on XP. It just kept telling me it had to be played on Windows 95.
3,Six degrees between ANY two events,"The unexpected origins of the modern world. If you've ever played the game of ""Six degrees from Kevin Bacon"" you'll at least understand this book. Whether you enjoy it or not depends on how much you can focus your attention because this is one hop, skip, and jump book. The author takes an event and shows how it is connected to another event much later in time by a series of meetings, mentors, friends, coincidences, etc. Then another such series is also described with the same start and end point. Wow! Isn't that amazing! And he does this again and again and again. Like ""six degrees"" you find that almost anything in this world is related to almost anything if you draw our the relationships thin enough. After the third or fourth thread I was exhausted at trying to follow the bouncing ball and gave up on the book."
4,Happy Fish,Our fish are happily enjoying their food and seem to be healthy. Seems like a good value for the quality and price.
4,Good Transitional Pond Food,Great food for fish going into suspended activity for the winter which in our area are harsh they love this food
5,"Tetra Pond Spring and Fall Diet Floating Pond Sticks, 3 Pounds",The Tetra Pond Spring and Fall Diet Floating Pond Sticks have my koi jumping for joy. The fish love the food and I know that it is the right diet to feed them during the spring and autumn. I will certainly order from Amazon from now on because in addition to having the perfect product readily available I am also benefitting from a fair price.
5,best racing game,"After playing with my PS2 and Xbox for about a year, I decided to go back to my Dreamcast and play my old games. Now first off, this game is so much fun! There are many tracks with shortcuts and bright backgrounds. The gameplay scheeme is just like the arcade version but with a new ""trick"" system which i thought as hard at first, but then it became fun. Now you can custimize your car with different engines, frames, paintjobs, tires and many more you can unlock. Oh, and multiplayer is just a blast. Racing is fun, but I liked the battle mode which was pretty cool. This game is my favorite racing game but my only complaint is your car doesnt fall apart and get dents when you crash into walls, I mean the weaker Nintendo 64 version has that feature! Anyways, this is a must buy for Dreamcast owners."
5,Great For Any Gamer,This game is great for any type of gamer ranging from 8 years to 50. This game is very simple to play. It may get boring after you have everything but when you play with your friends its a blast. This is a must get game for dreamcast. You can play stunt and show off your skills or you can battle eachother. If you think the battling is lame just try it and you'll see how cool it is.
4,A great game,"I have only played the demo version of this game and I loved it,exspicially the combat mode.In stunts there is a limited combination of tricks but the twirls and flips rock.In the racing mode the control can be frustrating,over time you will grow use to it.In the end you should by the game and see if it your type."
2,Not as good as the first ones.,"This game takes away from the reality-like feeling you get in the first 2 rush games. In those games you can look in Vegas and see the Stratosphere Tower, or drive through San Francisco and see the golden gate bridge. This game is too futuristic for my liking because the cars are futuristic and so are the scenarios. Stick to the first 2 games unless you like the futuristic feel. The one good thing about this game is the battle mode where you can battle your friends. That is where it earned it's 2nd star."
3,Excellent Game with One MAJOR Flaw,"San Francisco Rush 2049 is an EXCELLENT game in the arcades. However, the DreamCast version uses an extremely inept control layout which DOES NOT allow the possibility of using the left and right arrow buttons for steering. Control with the stick is slow and touchy at best, and certainly not everyone can afford to go buy a steering wheel just to have some measure of car control in the game. Those who are unaccustomed to using the left-hand control stick should definitely avoid the DreamCast version of the game if they do not already own or cannot afford to acquire a steering wheel."
3,not sure what it wants to be,"I have a number of Kershaw Ken Onion speedsafe designed knives from Boa to Chive. I loved the look of this one in photos and also liked the fact the configuration I bought had the pocket clip on the leather sheath, rather than the knife itself (it comes both ways apparently). But when it arrived, I realized it was impractical due to the size, sort of a gentleman's knife in a thick sheath. It is too small to justify a sheath and too polished to carry in a pocket without one (unless you want it to be a scratched up mess in short order). If this were the Centofante design in a Leek-sized knife it would be a beauty. As is, I am not sure what to do with it. (Fit, finish, and speedsafe opening mechanism are perfect.)"
3,very good and vibrant soul,"Good example of '60 white blues ,in this cd performs with excellent guitarist Tim Kaihatsu and in the total listening it don't seem out time.My favorite Clay's tune track is an aggressive soul blues played with verve.Peter.Stand Back! Here Comes Charley Musselwhite's Southside Band"
2,Decent Blues Album From Great Harmonica Player,"This album is decent. ""Clay's Tune"" and ""Juke"" are a lot of fun and the closing track is great. The opening tune is enjoyable. The rest of the songs are just sort of there. Musselwhite's vocals are nothing to write home about, especially when comparing them to the pipes of Little Walter Jacobs. I picked up this cd in Shinchon, South Korea, along with ""At Ease"", a great album by Coleman Hawkins, and ""At Town Hall"", a very good live album by Odetta, for only twenty five dollars altogether. Therefore, I don't have much to complain about. If you want to hear a white guy play and sing the Blues, I'd suggest going with John Hammond or perhaps Michael Bloomfield. For a more Blues-Rock feel, Johnny Winter can't be beat. I'm not too familiar with the rest of Musselwhite's stuff, as I'm mainly a Country Blues and Chess Records fan, but if you can find this album for a very cheap price, I suppose it's worth picking up. The liner notes are extremely skimpy."
4,highly useful,"a thoroughly helpful and easy to read reference book that effectively manages the highlights of its subject.It misses a point for simply not being all-encompassing. However, it is one of the most enjoyable and usable books around.The pages have a nice design that includes paragraphs and columns capturing the most important facts.Descriptive diagrams are interspersed - you get a lot of bang for the buck."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the Butterfly House as a gift for an old friend. It arrived with teh glass sides broken. Unknown to me, my friend arranged for a replacement to be shipped. This too arrived broken and she returned it for a refund (which Amazon forgot to process until I asked them about it. Save your money - it's too delicate to ship, it would seem."
1,bad kit,"I bought this kit for my 2001 chevy s10 with the 4.3 vortec. Blocks were easy springs were a pain in the a$$, had to take of both lower control arms. It looks good but after 2 months I blew my left ball joint and had to get my truck towed home. the handling is horrible, every dip on the freeway I'm bouncing everywhere not uncontroalblly but but enough to make me feel uncomfortable. Also ha to buy 4 nitro drop shocks which was another 200 from jegs. Total with the kit shocks ball joint and tow I was into it about 450$ for a static drop. I now have a 2000 s10 notched and bagged with 1/2 inch lines and it's wayyyyyyy smoother. If your doing it for the looks it's a great kit but if it's your daily driver and you use it for transportation I would highly recommend doing lowering spindles and lowering leaf springs"
3,OK but not what I expected,"The amount of light this nighlight puts out is just right for us--enough to see the stairs but not so bright that it keeps us awake if our bedroom door is open. However:- It's not as smooth and sleek-looking as the picture. It's curved, not flat, and the lights are right where the sockets are, it's not a single panel of light as I was expecting.- The sensor is not sensitive enough--the light never goes off, even with bright sun shining through the window.- My toddler was able to pull this out of the socket the first morning (and we don't have paneled or textured walls). My husband put double-sided tape on the inside and that seems to be working out."
3,Product not like shown in photo,"The photo on the website is misleading in the following ways:1) The night light is not that bright, it is a fairly weak night light--if you are looking for something with a little more umph, this is not the light for you.2) The light is not consistent across the fixture as shown on the photo--outlines and shadows of various fixture parts can be seen through the dome...it is brighter in the middle and weak on the edges.3) The photo does not show the light sensorI think it lives up to the billing as a light that is not as easily bothered by little toddlers. Other than that, I do not know if this is worth the $10 I paid for it."
1,Not what it seems...,"I think the idea of this product was great but it falls short of the discription. It does cover the outlet but it will NEVER turn off....We have tried normal sunlight, regular lamps and bright flashlights and nothing will turn the thing off...."
1,Never goes off,This night light is defective in that it never goes off unless it is bathed in bright light.
1,"UGLY!, NOT as pictured by manufacturer...",VERY disappointed.UGLYUGLYUGLYonly part of it lights up. it is not the full pretty lighting up that is featured in the photo. see my photos.and the ugly black dot.not worth sending it back.
2,Not as great as I'd hoped,"I thought this looked great online. I was especially interested since it covered both outlets. But I am disapointed in it, after all it is just a cheap nightlight. It doesn't glow as nicely as pictured, and there is a dark shadow around the edge, and a sensor in the middle that doesn't show in the picture. It is too inexpensive to bother returning, but I am looking for a different one."
5,Warm and Rich,"I am a huge Ian & Sylvia fan and, while I love everything they've done, I think this may be their best album. The sound is warm and rich and the song writing is excellent. 'Farewell to the North', 'Southern Comfort', 'Taking Care of Business', and 'She'll be Gone' are supurb and there's not a weak track to be found. I think Sylvia's voice may be at it's best on this album. Norbert Putnam, Ken Buttrey, and David Rea are tight."
1,Nobody behaves believably in this wouldbe chiller,"Lost Angel's horrifying premise - the abduction of a young child - is quickly diluted by characters who react irrationally to one implausible situation after another. For a real frison of fear, readers might want to pass up Wallace for Minnette Walters in whose hands even the most enigmatic characters and bizarre events reveal a psychological truth that can chill to the bone."
1,item undelivered,"the item is reasonably priced but the delivery takes a long time, its been a month from my order and I have not received my order"
3,Difficult read - but informative,"The style and presentation of the text is somewhat hard to follow for someone who likes history but is no expert such as myself. Especially the ""Histories"", which is a presentation of remnants. It was interesting to see just how screwed up the Roman political system was, and how much wheeling-and-dealing by the 'powers-that-be' were done at the expense of the commoners and armies. kind of like modern times. I'd recommend this, but only at a bargain price."
3,disappointed with quality,"The sleeping bag was not as discribed in advertisement. The quality was not up to the purchase price. Had this not been a grandson's Christmas gift, I would not have kept it. The purchase company, Whatever Sports has been impossible to get ahold of. They finally returned my call after three weeks and said they would get back to me but they have not. I will not order from this company again. If I had purchased this from a store or a catalog I would have not have had this problem. Only in an on-line purchase does a company have the right to substitute with a poorer product and not discount the price accordingly."
5,This game is tight!!!!,This game is the funnest nfl game i ever played its awesome. It has awesome graphics and controls. Quarterback training is cool
4,Well Organized But Dated,"I'm fairly happy with this phonics book. It's well organized and reinforces itself well. The only thing I don't like about it, is that it's very dated and some examples it uses my daughter doesn't relate with."
5,Great Collection,"Daedalus was a lot of fun while reading Nature, but this book just makes him even better. Not only you familiarize yourself with the devotion to weirdness (fortunately for us, with a scientific basis). Most of the things in the book make a lot of sense, and are really funny."
3,Gameboy Advance Sorry/Aggervation/Scrabble Junior,I haven't tried Sorry yet but Scrabble Junior was complicated at first and once I figured it out it couldn't hold my attention it's more for children. Aggervation was just boring...
4,Great!,"This software is amazing for the price. It has beautiful graphics and you can easily rotate the images by pointing, clicking and dragging them around. Worth the money many times over!"
2,Gift Recipient already had this item,"Thank you but Unfortunately the recipient of this gift already had this item, so I will need to return it .........."
2,Body Works Software,I was disappointed that this software cannot run without the CD in the drive. You can't load the software onto your computer.Body Works 6.0
5,The Kinkster Is A Classic,"I bought this album (Sold American) by Kinky Friedman after borrowing a tape of it from a friend. It's from the early 1970s and has something from that era for everyone. Whether it is a humorous look at women's lib (Get Your Biscuits In The Oven And Your Buns In The Bed) or the simple country anguish of Western Union Wire, Kinky Friedman & the Texas Jewboys bring their own individual style to every song on this cd. The best song, evoking Kinky's Texas Jewish roots, is Ride 'Em Jewboy."
5,Classic B2M.,"Great album, definitely worth the purchase and the cloud storage of all my music makes it a snap to listen anywhere I am. All of the best songs from the Boyz...takes me back."
4,fallin,"i owned this album as a teen and one of my fav songs was falling, I wanted to buy this album but didnt see fallin on the list"
5,Sophomore Superlative,"Of the 4 Boyz II Men CDs I have in my collection (Cooleyhigh, II, NMSW, and Full Circle) ""II"" is the most complete and is best representative of their immense talent. I think they really came into their own and hit their stride with this release. Every song on this CD is quality, but the high points are the ballads. Boyz II Men could work a ballad during their heyday. My favorite cuts on this CD are Jezzebel and 50 Candles. This should be in everyone's collection. Just luscious! 4.5 stars!"
1,This C.D. lacked any real singing talent.,"Dissapointing cd for a group that has been around as long as they have. The added sound bites were terrific, but anyone with an equalizer can accomplish the same feat."
1,Imagine a world without this band's boredom.....,"Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style."
4,my fave from them,this album for me is there best.very strong flow and very solid arrangements.for me there most complete effort.
5,It's better the 2nd time around,I had to buy this CD again because my kids scratched up the one I bought years ago. Excellent CD from start to finish!
5,Boyz II Men are II Good,This is one of my favorite CDs of all time. I love all the songs. How can you not when Boyz II Men are so great at what they do? I highly recommend this album to all you R&B lovers out there. You'll fall in love with this one.
1,JUNK,"I own 2 of these little disasters. Avoid this product at all costs. Videos skip, freeze, stop working altogether in the middle of a movie. Any command from the remote brings on a 1 minute whirling clicking computer confusion session. 2 of the power supplies have died I've spent another 60.00 replacing them. The thing is so picky about which dvds it will play that a brand new disc is in question of whether it will play. Nice screen, but every other part is the absolute cheapest pile of chinese crap that could possibly be found. Both of them are the same and function just as poorly. Hope this helps. Might be worth 25.00 if you plan to use a differant dvd player and power supply and just need a screen."
4,Beginning with proper tunes!,"I think this inexpensive book is a gem! I have found it suitable for use as teaching material with pupils of all ages. The progressive layout is attractive and easy to follow, with modern illustrations and text supporting the printed music. As my title suggests, one of its plus points is that, on the whole, the book offers REAL tunes for students to play (particularly important for older learners!) rather than specially concocted ones. Reservations? Some of the ""advice"" given is, perhaps, down to personal opinion (e.g. cleaning strings with eau de cologne!). Basically though, this book will encourage, rather than put off, the beginning pupil and carry them onto greater things!"
4,cute book,"This is a super cute book, and for the price I can't really complain. However, the pages are SUPER flimsy. Had I known how flimsy they were I would have paid more for a sturdier book!"
5,Great book,This is an excellent book and has brought much comfort. I would highly recommend this book for children and for folks of any age!
5,Deep,"This work simply goes way beyond any other review of Leonardo I have read. Based on a analytical disection of Leonardo's efforts not only of art yet his reasoning to create his masterpieces.The book borders on passing into a new dimension the one Leonardo attempted to enter. "" OH wretched mortals open your eyes"" (L) This work is capable of comparing the Art, the Expression, the Daily or instant feelings relative to the change, as the Human evolved during this period. Comparing God, Man, Nature, and Beast as they changed the World we live in."
2,NICE LOOKING BUT WITH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS,"Yes, the mister is a bit tricky to control, but not impossible. Where the tubing attaches to the bowl, the little connector thingie is too short. I had this all set up and it fell apart and I never could get it back together properly. With some improvisation and a little connector from the hardware store, we got it back together. BUT, I have never been able to get the mister angle correct so that it sprays directly upward. Bummer, because this is a neat looking addition to my hummingbird garden. Also, I did contact Schrodt via email soon after receiving it, but never did get a reply."
2,2 YEARS AND STILL NO BIRDS,"While this birdbath is a great idea, is easy to assemble & easy to use, it doesn't accomplish its primary purpose for me. No birds use it, and I've had it out for 2 years now. The first year, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought the birds were just taking a long time to find it. But this year, I watched birds come near it, or actually perch on the edge of it for a second, and then leave. They go to drink out of my decorative, NON-bird fountain instead.It's set up in a great location, in a flower bed with shelter close by, so I don't know why they don't like it. I don't think I'll set it up next year. I guess it'll be a yard sale item in the spring."
5,A Must Read,you can Never say enough about the Legacy of Bill Russell.The Man has words of Wisdom&He sheds Light on it.this Book brings you into His Views&what got Him to His Destiny.a must read from a Man who Proved on&off the court He was a Winner&one step ahead of the curve.
4,Great book,"Regarded as the NBA's ultimate winner Bill Russell and Russell Rules explains 11 basic lessons in becoming a leader and winner. Not only are these lessons benificiall on the basketball court but also in the office. This book is worthy of four starsAs written earlier Bill Russel is the ultimate winner. In Russell Rules he writes about his experinces in the NBA and how they have helped him become the ultimate winner. Also his eleven lessons on leadership are a guideline I belive many should take on the path to becoming a true leader in their everday life. Russell writes in a very motivational matter. He is very descriptive and his messages come out clear. All and All this is and excellent read for any young,old or middel aged reader. READ THIS BOOK."
5,Outstanding book on leadership and life,"Russell Rules is one of the best on leadership Ive read. He has some great insight into people and isnt afraid to speak his mind on controversial issues. I am impressed with how he explains his principles and how he arrived at them. The stories are great. Dont pass this up because you think it is just another sports book, its outstanding!"
2,"Insights about the Celtics, Platitudes about Life","I found this book interesting for what Russell had to say about playing for the Celtics and how he personally played the game ofbasketball.As far as lessons on leadership, I believe that what Russell and David Falkner (Russell's ghost writer) offered weremere platitudes that I have read in a hundred places before.If you want to learn about Russell's basketball career, read this book. If you are looking for leadership lessons, particularly as an entrepreneur and parent (the book's targets), go elsewhere."
1,Incredibly Arrogant,"Bill Russell has to be one of the most arrogant and smug athletes of all time! I was required to read this for a leadership class in graduate school. After reading a few chapters, I couldn't bear to go on any further. Every few pages, Russell feels the need to remind you of his greatness. Russell maintains that he was always creative and curious as a young player, and that is why he succeeded. This sounds nice for his book, but I doubt he actually had such a mentality at time. His success has more to do with the fact that there were few men of his size and skill to match up with him. I have always heard people say what a bitter and arrogant man Bill Russell is, now I know what they mean!"
4,Good old time who dun it,"I was very pleased when I saw the Ellery Queen Mysteries available on Amazon.It was an enjoyable show back when I was a kid and it is still is fun to watch today.The quality and presentation of the product is also very good.My only regret is they only made one season.The same people who produced this show later went on to do Murder, She Wrote which was a hit with fans."
4,Ellery Queen Mysteries,I remember these shows when I watched them in the 70's and they were great then It was too bad that the show did not continue but I think jim Hutton developed liver cancer and could not continue.The DVD's are one of the best mystery series before Murder She Wrote.
3,entertaining for couples to noodle through to the solutions,"I enjoyed most of the plots and the style of summarizing the suspects at the end. Challenging but a bit to ""canned"""
2,Why do we never identify contents?,"Why are these announcements silent as to their contents?Why do we never see what is presented on the DVD?If you aren't proud enough to reveal the contents, then you must not be very proud of the item you are announcing.I, for one, do not buy 'pigs in the poke'. Tell me what you are selling or don't bother me with your hoop de doo about nothing."
5,Ellery Queen,I am very happy with the product and price. Received it very quick. Would order something again.Ellery Queen Mysteries
3,Description from another site,"Included on this DVD are ""The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne,"" ""The Adventure of Lover's Leap,"" ""The Adventure of the Hardhearted Huckster,"" and ""The Adventure of the Disappearing Dagger."" Runtime is 196 minutes. All are in the 6-disc set."
5,A Dying Clue?!,"For years I've wanted this on DVD! I saw it offered, and at a reasonable price when I ordered, thus I've enjoyed all 22 episodes with a grin on my face and not-so-lightened wallet.Ellery Queen (Jim Hutton) and Inspector Richard Queen (David Wayne) worked so well together. They had a wonderful chemistry and you could see the enjoyment they took in working together. The guest stars were great actors and actresses as well, investing their parts with all the angst and mystery they deserved.The same team that brought COLUMBO and MURDER, SHE WROTE to television did ELLERY QUEEN. It shows in the writing and the characterizations. These are ""fair play"" mysteries, but that doesn't detract from the fun by any means; when Ellery Queen breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience, it's like being invited to play a game you didn't realize was going on.The addition of subtitles (which I wish Amazon.com's DVD descriptions mentioned) makes it a great set to have so that everyone can enjoy it."
5,Best Ever,"Jim Hutton is an absolute delight! The supporting cast is top rate. Enjoyable stories and amazing guest stars. An absolute ""must see""!"
4,Ellery Queen Mysteries,I remember when I use to watch this show on TV. I really liked it then and am glad I could get it now. Jim Hutton is a very good actor. He is calm and seems to not get over anxious about much of anything. I have seen him in some movies and he is good. David Wayne is the perfect person to play his Dad.
5,One the Best TV Detective Ever,"A real Who-Dun-It. Easy to follow stories, like Murder She Wrote (which it is patterned after). Just like Murder She Wrote, which came much latter, it has ever old Movie, Stage, TV Star drafted to play it. It is kind of great fun to see them in their twilight years. Enjoyed ever Episode. Something that can be watched over and over and still be fun."
5,ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!,"After many years of waiting and hoping and bootleg copies offered on other websites, The Genuine Official release of ""Ellery Queen"" starring Jim Hutton has finally arrived and I gotta say ,,,it was well worth the wait!! The packaging was nothing short of first rate and imaginative. Honestly, I couldn't have come up with a better way to have put this together(although the discs themselves could've packed better because the even numbered discs are placed under the odd numbered ones and sometimes I want to watch the episodes on say, disc 4, I have to take out disc 3 and... Well it gets a little irritating)! The graphics are amazing, the layout very slick with clips from various episodes, and the overall combination of color and objects pertaining to the program are A-1 top notch!!! If you're a fan, I HIGHLY recommend you get this DVD set and watch until your eyes bleed!!!! C-YA!!"
5,"Grew up with it, and love it still","I was really happy to see that this was finally on DVD. I used to watch it with my mother when it was on A&E in the 90's and I hadn't seen it since then. It was everything I remembered it to be. I enjoy not knowing the answers until Ellery reveals them, so I have no problems with the clues being vague. I'm just along for the ride. The set is really nicely put together with a total of 6 discs and a flyer insert with a synopsis of each show. I can't believe how inexpensive the set is at $30. I was expecting it to be double that. It's really nice that I was able to afford the set, otherwise - it would still be on my wishlist."
4,Mysteries,"The Ellery Queen Mysteries was a gift for my husband. He reads mystery books, watches mystery programs on TV and movies. He loves watching Perry Mason. The DVD was a welcome surprise. He has spent hours watching the five DVDs. I think he especially likes the segment at the end that invites you to solve the mystery."
4,Enjoyable,Good fun. Has a retro feel to it. Too bad there isn't anything like it today. Good for people who enjoy a murder mystery but not all the gore.
1,did not receive articles,since I never received Ellery Queen Mysteries I cannot rateI had purchase the set before but gave it away. I was hopingto replaceit
3,"Good, but dated","The primary characters, Jim Hutton's Ellery Queen and David Wayne as his father and police inspector, are good. But the scripts are dated, and the guest stars are often stiff (perhaps that's why so many faded as movie stars)."
2,A failed Queen's Gambit,"I found it difficult to believe the rave reviews of a television show that lasted only a single season on NBC. But I went for it anyway. And my worst suspicions were confirmed. The direction is below average, the stories are weak, the casting is terrible (while David Wayne is okay, Jim Hutton would be better as Li'l Abner), and the entire format is questionable. Ellery Queen is seen as a bumbling, personality-free genius who solves a mystery in record time and then turns to the camera for a monologue on the plot. Inspector Morse it isn't.The only slightly redeeming factor in this flop is the appearance of the guest stars. Try Colombo, which is better in every way, including the guest stars."
3,Hard to relate,"Ms. McKinney has written some very good ones, but this one just isn't. I don't where to begin. The story seems interesting enough, but I didn't feel I could really relate to these characters. I didn't really like Edward and didn't feel there was any real depth or growth to his character. As for Lavinia, I was annoyed by her lack of strength in some areas. One minute there's anger, the next they're in love..no gradual movement that i could follow..it jumped a little too much for my taste. However, I can say one good thing..you could definitely detect the passion and chemistry between the two, so i suppose that's what carried me through the story. It's not a real bad read, but again, Ms. McKinney can do better. She's still one of my favs though!"
2,Miss McKinney...What Happened?,"This is by far one of Megan McKinney's worst efforts to date. In it the author has created one of the most unlikable heroes in a romance novel, and as a result, you couldn't care less whether Edward and Lavinia got together or not. And for actually falling in love with Edward when the guy hasn't had one good word to say about her during all the time they've known each other? Well, Miss Lavinia Murphy must have a load of self-esteem problems as well as an extremely bad taste in men. Consequently, she was no more likable than the dark, spiteful, self-righteous Edward."
1,What a disapointment this newest book of Ms. McKinney's was.,"After loving A Man to Slay Dragons, and Gentle From the Night, I was extremely upset and disappointed to have paid nearly $20.00 for this new book of Ms. McKinney's. I found I could have cared less whether or not the heroine got together with the very unlikeable hero. The plot could have been so much more interesting, however, Ms. McKinney seemed to consentrate more on having the hero, Edward, call the heroine, Lavania, names, and in general find nothing worthwhile about her. I had to agree with him. However, he was no winner either. I did like his physical description though. Also, as for unbelieveable, a duke would never have married a nobody with an illigetimate child the way Kyle unquestioning went after Hazel. The entire story was glossed over, and the next time Ms. McKinney publishes a book, it will have to be a much slicker story line than The Fortune Hunter provided, before I will consider buying it in hardback."
2,How unfortunate,"The leading man was a douche, from beginning to end. That about sums up why I was not at all enthralled with this novel, nor even a tad invested. Anything nice he said, I didn't buy it, coming on the heels of insults and disagreeable behaviour, which was soon followed by more of the same.McKinney is a talented writer, but her talents could have been put to better use. Like... making her hero evolve into a likable person? Douchiness is okay if the douche realizes he is one and changes. No such luck with our Edward. He seemed to not even be aware of his faults, never mind trying to fix them.If the characters were real people, I would not forsee a happy ending. I see spousal abuse, both mental and physical, at the hands of a cold, controlling jerk. Dismal prospects."
5,words from a drophead,"so maybe you won't take me to heart, but this is truly a great album. the drop's music inspires me to groove each and every time i hear it. the unpredictability of the music is what does it; you wanna try and figure it out but you can't ever really GET it. _into the red red room_ is my #1. now that they are on cd, i can practice... and get closer to knowing some of those lyrics."
5,WHOA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the illest mixtape of ANY L.O.X cat. Styles goes hard on this album. Lyrical genius...and by far the dopest emcee in the L.O.X. Dont get me wrong...they are all flame throwers, but P. has the most versatility. He can be a beast and attack G-Unit, he can be conscious and afrocentric and make a track with Floetry, or he can be poetic and use mind blowing metaphors over a Pete Rock and Premo beat. The kid is the total package, and its ALL displayed on this CD. People...Styles P. raps over the classic ""T.R.O.Y"" beat...and absolutely sets FIRE to it !! That alone is worth the purchase to hear a wordsmith like P. spit over the classical (almost supernatural) production of Pete Rock."
3,this one right here will be a mixtape classic for those on styles p!,"I listen to the first cd vol one,but have not listen to vol 2....i know it will be good as the first!cop this!!!"
5,"Great ideas, well presented",I got this book to help with a wall painting project I was doing. I ended up using transfer paper instead of doing a stencil but the ideas in the book were really helpful and inspiring. The projector was perfect for what I needed. Now I'm planning more projects around my house and will definitely use the stencil technique as well.
1,Don't Buy,I followed all of the directions to the letter on this product. It does not work. Do not waste your money.
5,AN EXCELLENT BUDDY,"This is rated poor I don't know why, it's a great CD. It is very well produced. I have about 30 of his CD'S, this is one of my favorites of his older music. This is classic Buddy it has the guitar we all love, and his vocals are just what we would expect to hear. The songs are all great, the only problem I can see is the CD is to short. In my opinion this is well worth buying."
2,not as good as competing hdtv receivers,"I bought this box hoping for an improvement in signal reception with an indoor antenna. I currently have to move my antenna to 2 different positions to receive different sets of HD channels (kind of annoying). Right now I use the Terk rotating antenna since I've had the best luck with it.When I replaced my Zenith with the Samsung receiver, I found that this box does not receive signal as well as my Zenith when using the exact same antenna configuration. In fact, several of the channels I receive with my Zenith I could not receive at all with the Samsung even after fiddling for quite some time with the antenna.I guess I will use this as an extra box for the guest bedroom. If you are worried about reception I would definately look at getting a Zenith hdv420 instead."
4,Good OTA HDTV receiver,"This receiver is very easy to set up. One selection in the menu will check for any HDTV broadcasts in your area and selects them. The screen aspect selection is easy to choose, depending on the type of set you have. My widescreen LCD selected the 16:9 aspect ratio and it looks wonderful. The dolby digital sound is great. I connected it with a coaxial digital cable and it's excellant. If you have your local channels broadcasting in HDTV, pick one of these up and connect it. It's a very light unit with easy to use menus and the remote is small, but full function. I like it very much."
2,Does not display correctly on 4:3 TV,"Please note that unless you are going to use a 16:9 ratio TV the 4:3 display will get stretched and cropped in zoom mode and there is no work-around. The SIR-T351 has the same problem, but luckily the SIR-T151 (that I also own) does NOT have this problem"
1,Didn't work!,"I was extremely excited when I received this product and have had good success with Samsung products. However, when I made all the connections, the unit didn't work. I was disapointed and frustrated. All the connections and settings were correct, but it didn't work. I have an older DVI connection instead of the newer HDMI digital connection.I returned the product and bought the Humax brand HDTV tuner. I bought a DVI to HDMI cable and connected the unit. It works like a charm! I don't know what was wrong with the Samsung SIR-T451, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I'm also having second thoughts about Samsung products now. It seems like the reliability/quality factor of Samsung products has declined now that they are more mainstream."
1,Decent unit- Terrible customer support,"I had a defective unit. Still under warranty, Samsung said they would replace it, but it was on backorder. 2 months later (and without any satellite signal to my main TV)and no new unit, I call them and come to find out that they were not going to replace it, but instead issue a refund (not including the sales tax). I had to fax a receipt, and wait another 2 weeks for an RA and shipping ticket. Once they received the unit in Mid-August, I am told that the check will take 8 weeks. 9 weeks later, no check. I call again and there was a supposed glitch in the communication at the wharehouse and that they would process my refund immediately, AND I SHOULD GET THE CHECK IN FOUR WEEKS. If the check arrives on time, it will be 7.5 months. So think twice before you buy any Samsung product, especially if its your primary source of entertainment...like television"
1,Poor excuse for an expensive box,"I bought this ""HDTV set top box"" when there were no other choices of set top boxes. It was very expensive.Pro: reasonable picture, sound is ok, many choices of out put format.Con: Menu screen only works in the DVI out put mode, SAP does not work, remote is poorly planned, remote need to be very close to unit to work, no channel ""back"" button, HDTV picture quality is poor.HDTV picture quality explained: The HDTV on the surface looks OK, but when you start looking at the 480p, 720p or 1080i digital picture quality, there are many funny looking ""halo"" around bright objects in the picture. Apparently the fringe filter is not working or not implemented in the design. There is no control for brightening or dimming the picture to try and reduce the ""halo"" effect.I do not recommend this expensive receiver to any quality HDTV connosseur."
4,"Fun ride, would translate to film in a rock n' roll way","A fun ride of a book with a good pay-off. The music takes you down memory lane (Stones, Heart, Aerosmith, Kinks and more) and tells of how some get started in the industry. It also has a cool story about the original Twisted Sister and Cyndi Lauper's beginnings. Very cool. The band members are interesting characters; they are vivid. It would be easy for me to see Adam Sandler playing Mike the bassist. And Rosie's role would be terrific if Rosie Perez stepped up to do it. If I was a screenwriter I'd grab hold of this one!"
2,Don't Buy From Amazon,"$9.49 is really expensive for jewelry cleaner. Instead of ordering off Amazon, where you have to pay shipping and handling too, go to your local jewelry store. Most have cleaners for sale, and for a lot cheaper than Amazon's. Plus, a lot of jewelers will professionally clean and check your jewelry for free. Go to a real jeweler for real jewelry cleaner!"
2,Not work on silver,"I bought this cleaner for my pure silver pin. I soaked the pin in the cleanser for minutes and then brushed it. The pin still look black and never return to the white as before. This cleaner may work good for diamond or so, but does not seem work good at all for silver."
5,Sparkly!,I love this brand. Makes my diamond ring look as sparkly as the first day I received it. Highly recommended. Also love the Connoisseurs Gel & Brush jewelry cleaner.
3,Didn't read the small print!,"I guess it's my fault, but this cleaner is not good for sterling silver. Just gold/diamonds/platinum andprecious stones. ! A lot ofmy jewelry is SS!! I just didn't read it well."
5,Finally a quality product!,"After fussing around with producgs from our small town hardware store it was great to get a quality, heavy-duty product that does the job. I use this product on our farm and it has not let me down. The price was a plus also."
5,This is Awesome!,If you like salt-water fishing but don't want to get sea sick or pay the large sums of money for the boat this game is for you. It has great graphics and tons of different fish. This is a must for all Computer Fishermen and women.
4,awesome key chain knife,"I ordered this for my boss as a Christmas gift. Came well before the holiday,and I wish I would have ordered one for me!"
5,Kershaw Ken Onion Centomente Knife,The Kershaw Ken Onion Centomente Knife arrived quickly and completely. It was exactly what I wanted.
2,Not good,"I had hopes of using this music for some routines in a dance recital. Unfortunately, it's way to child-like and cheesy. The voices are annoying and the tunes not very catchy. Only a very young child who loves particular dog breeds would enjoy this music."
5,Good collection...,"These three movies are favorites of mine, except that the Laurel and Hardy is a lot dated. You should enjoy tthe other two and this collection makes a great inexpensive gift."
2,Ruined Pocket Full Of Miracles,"I bought this mainly for Pocket Full Of Miracles, which has always been a favorite film of mine. This version has been butchered. One whole scene is missing (where Ann-Margret asks Betty Davis to come live with them in Spain), others are shortened, and many are just snippets, badly edited. Don't waste your money."
3,MGM Movie Collection,"I was surprised, and dismayed that the March of the Wooden Soldiers was not on the disc. To the credit of those who I got it from, they refunded my money."
4,Great 'Ole Movie,Bought for 'Bishop's Wife'. Carey Grant is a hunk & funny. Nice perk to get 3 movies. Rec'd quickly & in terrific condition.
2,Pocketful of Miracles Quality Disappointing,"I bought this set for the Bette Davis movie, and didn't expect first-rate reproduction for the other two early films, but had seen an excellent version of this title, available on DVD. However, what I got was garish color, with an unpleasant graininess which made watching the movie painfully uncomfortable after having seen a beautifully produced copy. What a shame, to ruin such a fine film classic. The Bishop's Wife, on the other hand, was quite acceptable, so the purchase was not entirely a loss."
1,Extremely POOR Quality!,"As I bought this collection primarily for ""Pocketful of Miracles"", I was very dissappointed in the quality from MGM to say the least. I bought this collection over the single copy available due to a more recent year of release. I was hoping for anamorphic widescreen (No side bars). Not only was it the old widescreen edition (not adapted for Widescreen TVs), but the extreme graininess, and I am not exagerating when I say EXTREME, as well as the overall poor color made it unwatchable!! It hurts to see a Billy Wilder classic with Bette Davis that deserves better distributed like this. Please, If anyone knows of a good quality pressing of this movie let me know. Don't waist even $6.99 on this collection!! You've been warned!"
3,Disappointing,"If anyone buys this video with the idea of learning the truth about Eva Peron's life, he'll be disappointed. Unfortunately, it appears the producers of ""Biography"" simply accepted the misinformation that Webber/Rice used for their production. It was interesting to see real life film of scenes that were reproduced in the movie. Otherwise, the video is very disappointing. If one wants to know about the real Evita, look for a good book. Considering how little research seems to have gone into the production of this biography, I'll be slower in accepting what I see in other A&E Biography segments."
5,ruling graphics for the system specs,This game is really fun and runs on any system 90mhz or higher.for the specs this game rules and the graphics are amazing if you buy this game be warned that no NT systems work. but if it works you will be amazed compared to the starwars games of the time. And it's really cheap for the gameplay but theres no saport anymore or website for help.
1,False advertising,"The picture makes it looks like this is a AT&T Prepaid Welcome Kit. In fact, it is just a SIM card. I ended up going to a local AT&T shop to get what I needed. Wasted money."
2,not reliable,"i've had these speakers for several years. the sound is now barely audible. from reading other's problems, it appears that an IC circuit fails after being used awhile.there are better, more reliable speakers."
2,"Rampage good, Paperboy Bad","This was the first game I purchased for my GBA SP. I was pleased with Rampage. Just like the Nintendo version. Paperboy, they made it almost impossible to control the paperboy. The d-pad for driving and a/b for throwing the papers was the best way this game was played. Having to press A to accelerate and B to slow down and the L and R buttons at the top corners to throw papers while steering with the d-pad makes you tire of the game very quickly.A re-release of this game with the old-style controls would be great cause the current reincarnation of the game makes it impossible to get through the first day let alone complete."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,This game sucks more than superman 64! First I will tell you about rampage. Rampage is so stupid beacause when a tank comes to attack you you can jump over it but that is not stupid part. The stupid part is when you jump over the tank it does not come back to attack you and it is to easy and does not save where your at or your score! Now thats stupid! I saved the most horrible game for last Paperboy! Paperboy is to hard when it is on easy! It is imposeible to beat level 1 on easy beacause you keep running into stuff like cars with your freacking bike! This game is ******* trash! I am so disapointed in this game. Do not buy this game they could have made this game better.:( PS I guess rampage is ok.
3,"Stunning cakes, but not practical for an American kitchen","The cakes shown in this book are gorgeous. But, the bulk of them require the use of fondant or marzipan - ingredients which are not typically used by an American cook, and (depending on where you live) which can be impossible to find in local stores. Although it is not as sophisticated, I would recommend buying the Betty Crocker's New Cake Decorating book rather than this one."
5,Music that heats up your body and warms up your heart,"Although this Belgian duo's first song ""A volta"" was compiled worldwide on varouis complitations like Café Del Mar,MTV's Chill Out, their first full-cd ""Oyebo Soul"" was/is especially a national succes and it's a shame that not more people worldwide are aware of this fantasic album. The mixture of afro-brazil-rock-house-hop, as they call it themselves, seems a bit impossible to combine in one record, but when you listen to it, you find yourself dreaming away of far distance shores en nipping of tropic cocktails on this melting pot of warm voices and great music. It may suprise you that the makers of this record are from a country where the weather is often grey and rainy but these Belgians guys are succeeded in heating up my body and warming my heart. Fans of Leftfield, Thievery Coporation, Buddha Bar, Groove Armada, Massive Attack and another great Belgian artist Buscemi, will surely appreciate this fine piece of quality music!"
4,Top Quality... Hefty price,"I use this product for the Canon G1.The quality of the photos i have taken are great, and i'm really happy with the pics. Huge Resolutions, a good printer, and a decent overall effect.I would say though, that for 60-90 bucks you should get this only if you plan to use it... (ie: Flower Close-ups, wilderness photos of small items etc...)"
4,"A solid album and highly recommended, a pity there isn't a s","This duo delivered an album with some great loveballads like: She needed me, Turn U out and Love goes on. And the songs: Forget I was a G and Your love is a 187 (kind of a ballad).Some songs on the cd are less than the aforementioned material but it is one of my favorite cd's to pop in and listen to some fine (and sometimes very useable) lyrics."
3,1 Hit Wonder..Sort of...,"The album was released amidst the mid-90's R&B influx with HipHop samples being thrown into a song to classify it as ""marketable"". Though the primary (sole) hit was simply 2-part harmonic vocals and keys, and received minimal air play (NO MARKETING), the song had a hook and potential. you might recall the tune, ""Beautiful Black Princess"". Wrapped in youthful, and seemingly nationalistic lyrics, the song delivers a melodic, piano-driven soul to a prose that could easily have been written about someone's mother, daughter or best girl. I'd always liked the song, but never thought I'd be able to find it in digital format. For me it was worth the money for just the one song; I gave it 3*** simply and solely for this reason. I think I may have listened to one other song on the compilation in the past, a true statement to how homogenized HipHop-infused R&B can be..."
3,Hope the 2nd edition fixes the many mistakes of the 1st,"This volume of Virgin's mamoth collection is the one they should have paid most attention, but unfortunately it is plagued with errors, to the point where I started to question if they checked the facts before the book went to print. Following the music scene in the 90s require a lot of energy because of the many trends that pop-up by the minute, hence I would consider this volume to be the most dauting task within the whole series."
5,best lip balm ever!,"This really is an excellent product. It is all natural, has a soothing, pleasant scent and is long lasting. It leaves your lips soft for hours.It has a great name and really is a great product, I would and have recommended Chicken Poop to anyone...and there is a story behind the name."
5,"Good stuff, just wish the idea was transferable...","I have to say, I love this product. Who'd've thought that putting chicken poop on your lips could be so great! I just wish it worked as well with other types of poop. We live in farmland, and I can tell you that smearing cow, horse, dog, cat, pig, llama or sheep poop (or any of the possible combinations) on your lips doesn't have quite the same effect, believe me I've been trying this for months. I even managed to get my hands on some turkey poop, you'd think that'd be pretty close to chicken poop. All I've managed to get from these trials are the odd disease once in a while.Take my advice and stick with chicken poop!"
4,I luv Chicken Poop,I bought this when I saw it sitting on the counter at Drug Emporium. It had a big chicken with these little chapsticks coming out of it's rear!!It is some good chapstick---the only down side is the taste is a little nasty tasting. I am more of a strawberry flavored chapstick fan. This is just plain jane flavored.
3,Alright.,"I'd have to say that this game is not that bad, but is not that good either! The graphics are mostly good. The only really bad thing is that it is so easy! I beat it in two days. I didn't play it till a month after I got it because it has no storyline and is hard to get into. There are way better games out there, but maybe you will like it better than I did."
1,My biggest GBC disappointment yet,"Being an avid fan of the arcade Rush 2049 machine, I could not pass this title up... I wish I had! The graphics are decidedly below par, the cars move at a snail's pace, and all the adrenalin-pumping action from the original is nowhere to be found. There is some decent digitized speech in the game, but the music itself is flaky and keeps turning off and on during the race, exposing you to the completely unrealistic engine noise. The powerups always drop back in the same pattern, there is no randomness at all... What upset me most of all though is that the game failed to unlock the second track after I finished 3rd (like the track start screen promised), and even worse, the race afterward (again on track one) it CRASHED my Gameboy! If you're looking for a decent overhead racing game, you should give Driver a try, it looks, sounds and runs MUCH better. My summary: the title does not nearly cover the game. For shame Midway, I know you can do better!"
5,The Last Days Of A Great People,"This is the finest and most intricate graphic book (not quite a novel) I've ever read. The illustrations reach levels of beauty and artistry seldom seen in this genre of storytelling. Comanche Moon (not to be confused with the Larry McMurtry novel of the same name) tells the end times history of the Comanche peoples, with emphasis on their great leader, Quanah Parker, and his mother, the ""white Comanche"" Cynthia Ann Parker. The story of the Comanche's' violent way of life, their struggles against the whites in Texas and across the Southwest, and of the brilliant leadership of Quanah Parker, are rendered in a way that provides as much meaningful information to a reader as most text-only tales of the Comanche and the brutal period of the mid-1800's thru the 1870's. This is a great (though often sad and bloody) segment of North American history, and this rapidly-paced, carefully produced graphic re-telling of it is a more than worthy read."
4,Comanche Moon picture history of Cynthia Ann Parker,"The book is very well illustrated as this is all it is with captions, more along the lines of a comic book. The book follows Cynthia Ann Parker's remarkable story of how she was abducted by the Comanche's and raised as their own. Good book if you like just an illustrated depiction with captions. The book as a whole is well done and I recommend for anyone interested in Cynthia Ann Parker.Ken Edmondson"
4,southern goodness,"I don't know why this album isn't better known among both Jazz fans, as well as Crusaders fans. Well, I know why it's not high on jazz lists; mainly because it's not traditional jazz so the purist snobs will dismiss it. But honestly, this is pure fun. Great soulful jazz tunes, with some funk and blues in the mix too. A true southern gumbo of musical goodness. Any Crusaders fans should enjoy this one. And if you appreciate well played instrumental music of any genre, this is a very worthwhile album to get."
4,My all-time favorite!.,"This Crusaders' album is my favorite. The music takes me to a special place & time while stationed in Thailand . . . beautiful, funky, jammin' music!"
2,Poor quality DVD..!,The premise of this movie is a disgraced Naval officer who has deserted prior to the outbreak of WW2 reenlists as an enlisted man and is assigned to a coastal minesweeper as a sharpshooter and hardhat diver. Fairly good story and shows how mines are cleared. This DVD however is dark and the transfer is very poor. Some scenes are just a black screen and the action is unseen. Before the studio releases these movies they should be restored and remastered. As it is I cannot recommend buying this DVD due to it's poor quality. The movie/story is good however.
3,Poorly copied video,"I watched this movie and while I enjoyed the movie itself, the video and audio were not up to standards. At times, the video was doubled and fuzzy at other times. At best the video was ok. The audio was slightly better. At times the audio was slightly garbled. If I was asked if I would buy this dvd again, I would decline."
4,Just good movies,My wife and I enjoyed this movie because her parents worked on the minesweepers in World War II.It's great to see the support from Hollywood you don't see that anymore.
1,"What was the plot?? Re-titled: MindWiper, please!","OK were writers and movie-goers just plain dumb in that era? I don't think so, maybe simple. Just another hackey plot-less B&W WWII movie...or WWI, hard to tell since the quality is bad. I think they wrote, filmed and edited this in less than week. Don't look for any point or plot because it wasn't girl meets boy or guy is a hero, hell he gets other people killed. I don't understand what moron goes AWOL from the Navy to join the Coast Guard to get unsuspecting patriots killed. Awful!"
3,From Back Cover,"Lucinda Townshend was doomed to live a servant's life in London. Her stpemother had little use for her - except for domestic chores and tending the townhouse garden. But one night, a handsome and cultured gentleman wandered into Cinda's garden. William Stedman, the Duke of Grenville, was utterly enchanted with the girl. He vowed to carry her away, to change her destiny forever. She was everything he ever desired, the lady of his dreams...Then a ghastly crime threatened their future. The Duke was forced to hide in the shadows of London's moonlit streets. And Cinda promised to unveil the real culprit at a glittering masquerade ball...For the dangers that lurked in the night were no match for the passion they found in each other's arms."
2,Fascinating Story Pooly Told,"This is truely a fascinating story, but unfortunately the author is unable to write his way out of a paper bag. His writing style is so uneven and jagged that it was often very hard for me to follow the story line."
1,Atrociously bad writing ruins an otherwise fasinating story,"This is an interesting story and an interesting moment in time, but the writing is so atrociously bad, I couldn't get through it. I should have known when I read the first few sentences: ""At some point during the late spring of 1983, Richard Baker realized he was in a pickle. He wasn't alone. Hundreds of people were stewing in the same juice."" The writing and storytelling just goes downhill from there. Or, as someone once said, he ""hits bottom and starts digging."" Michael Downing jumps from one topic to the next, and, because the writing is so awful, it's challenging to figure out what his intentions are. A very disappointing telling of a fascinating story. Ugh! Downing says in the introduction, ""I am the wrong person to write this story."" He's right. Don't bother."
2,The Lineage Of Abuse,"I finally got around to reading this sad pitiful tale. The ""problem"" with all this zen stuff, the way it is presented inMichael Downing's book, is that there's never any mention of people truly waking up. That's because in this particular zen school, practice and realization are the same thing, only no one knows it. As a zen priest, partially engaged in this lineage, I know many of the players Downing writes about. And they are a very sad bunch - no energy, no joy, no peace, no nothin'. I knew this 30 years ago when I tried to practice at the place...At least another book puts the whole thing in some perspective."
2,Sensationalized!,"This author's writing style is that of a gossip columnist, punching points with personal excalmatory comments. However, the book does shed light into the deep secrets of this organization.I'm glad I purchased a used copy of this book."
4,Gives a good explanation of the artist's work.,"As an art teacher, I have been very impressed with this series of books for children. This volume, in particular, helps to explain some of the interesting and yet bizarre qualities of this surreal artist. I look forward to the next book in this series."
5,PLEASURABLE LISTENING MUSIC,ROY C IS THE TYPE OF ARTIST THAT HAS A STYLE AND SOUND THAT IS TRULY HIS OWN. I GREW UP LISTENING TO THIS ALONG WITH MY BROTHERS.THEY WERE REALLY FOND OF HIM AS THEY LEARNED TO REALLY TALK TO AND TREAT A LADY.IT WAS ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE STEREOTYPE THAT BLACK MEN HAD. THE SONG IF I COULD LOVE YOU FOREVER SHOWED THAT BLACK MEN COULD REALLY LEARN TO LIVE AND LOVE ONE WOMAN. MY BROTHER LORIN WAS IN A BAD MMOD HE WOULD COME IN AND PLAY HIS 45'S OF ROY C. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS CD OR ANY CD BY ROY C TO ANY AND EVERYONE!!! THERE IS NO CURSING AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY CAN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC OF ROY C.
5,Very happy with the bird nesting house.,"Arrived just in time for the coldest week of the season. I put it up on our 6 ft fence post behind some green giant arborvitae trees. Hopefully they will start nesting in it to help keep warm. I check on it every few days but haven't seen any activity just yet, so I will just give it a few more days or weeks until they find it on their own."
1,Unwatchable,The only thing good about this series is that it ended quickly. By and large a total waste of time. Watch it only if you're already suicidal.
3,Where is Part 1?,Part 2 is great! I should know because I have two of them! My question is: Where is Part 1? Will I have to buy it again when Amazon Finnally fixes this problem?
3,CAUTION! 10-4-09 Problem with Episode 1,"On October 3, 2009, I received the pilot (episodes 1 and 2). But BOTH were episode 2 from the streaming service (via my Roku box). I contacted customer service and I hope that this will be corrected soon."
2,Stargate Continuation,"This is a good continuation on the series's concept. Although it seems like ""Star Trek Voyager's"" story line of lost on the other side of the universe, it does give an interesting spin on experiences, especially with the capability of ""trading bodies"" on Earth for a short period of time.Can't wait for Season 2 to be available.Hope the storyline continues to be as good, or better."
2,Would youlike some cheese with that?,"For a group of military and scientific people trained to go on a mission, they sure do break down awfully quick into a bunch of whiners!This is NOT the Stargate Universe! Stargate has always been ""Hey, we're in deep crap here, but lets pull it together, figure it out, and get home""Instead we get a group of people boohooing their situation, whining about their situation, and blaming anyone in site for their situation. This isn't Battlestar Stargate. It's Lost In Space Stargate.The best thing they did??? Kill off the politician!!!"
5,Outstanding TV,"As a big fan of the stargate series, from the beginning including atlantis SGU has brought another perspective to TV. When Battlestar came out it created a complete new way of watching SCIFI, i love it, and felt that BSG was one of the greatest TV show i have ever seen, disappointed when it ended, BUT there was closure.SGU, carried on essence of the darkness of BSG, and has the possibility of becoming a masterpiece in it own rights! I should have a beginning, middle and an end. Unfortunately this will never happen............ BRING IT BACK FOR ADDITIONAL SEASONS! There is so much crap on tv that gets renewed, just because it was on the right nights and not conflicting with other shows and so far SGU has always had to much competition. The ratings system is not working in this day and age, you need to look at the international markets as well including releasing the shows at the same time of the US to get a accurate rating results.SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete First Season"
4,Stargate Unuverse,"Never saw it when it came out. Never saw the original. Don't really care for Atlantis, just me. I like this. A lot of people say it's slow. I am glad I bought it. I like the way the characters and plot develop. Do hope they come out with another season. ""Man that guy's a lot of work!"""
5,SGU,"I wasn't a huge Stargate fan until I started watching this show. I had seen some Stargate Atlantis prior to watching this series, but that was just about all I knew of the Stargate genre. That being said, the Stargate Universe series is exceptional and quickly turned into one of my all time favorite shows. I am very sad that there were only two seasons, and extremely unsatisfied with how they ended the second season. I hope they bring it back sometime so the legacy can continue."
3,Confused,Does anyone know why this set is more than a $130 andSgu Stargate Universe: Complete First Season [Blu-ray] this one is like $30? is there any difference?
4,Stargate Universe returns to the roots of science fiction!,"Although the series isn't perfect, this incarnation of Stargate successfully melds the mythology of Stargate with the human interaction and survival that is the core of science fiction writing. Season 2 promises to be even better. Now if we could just get that SGA movie."
1,Not for fans of SG-1 or Atlantis,"Basically, it's boring. It's a soap opera in space. If you like Battlestar Galactica, then you'll like this. But if you like Sg-1 and Stargate Atlantis, you'll hate it."
2,Frustrating.,Interesting concept that suffers from uneven dialogue writing and stupid plots.A certain mad scientist gets annoying with his tantrum throwing. Sci-Fi dumbed down right before your eyes.
1,CANCELED YET?,This is another horrible incarnation of Stargate SG1. This is some ones rewrite of Battlestar Galactica. No ethics or morals showing up anywhere. Can we say CANCELED. Stargate SG1 we are sorry.
1,Painful to watch,"Easy to see why this series got cancelled. It is a loser. Why not continue the SG1 series or at least the Atlantis series. Dumb, dumb, dumb...."
1,awful,I really wish this show had never been made. The people in charge should be ashamed.Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis were much better.Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series CollectionStargate Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection
1,Soap opera,Don't waste your time on this series. It's like watching one of the stupid daytime soap operas that never go anywhere.
1,Awful...pass if you liked the othere SGs,"I have watched all the shows up to 'Life' and I kept hoping that they would turn it around, but I don't think that is going to happen. There is no humor, no tech, no aliens, even tho they are on a vastly advanced alien ship. A ship filled with people you will learn to dislike.There is not one character that stands out as interesting. They have constant contact with earth through some stone shown during SG1, but instead of swapping places with people who could go onto the ship to help figure out how to take control of it, they simple use the device to visit family at home.This show is dark and slow paced, but more importantly its boring. I find it hard to believe that the current writers understood the first 2 SG shows. The lack of an interesting plot shows the wrong writers were picked for the job.Unless they start to take a diffrent direction I would avoid this show."
1,"mostly, a huge a mistake","I love Stargate SG-1 & Stargate Atlantis, but all I can say about SGU is that the entire series (which lasted only one season, thankfully) was a mistake. Don't bother."
3,character driven and too slow and lacks tension,The problem is that the series is character driven and not plot driven. Most of the characters are not like able. I like rush young and Eli. Most of the conversion that character are not interesting. The writers are good make interesting events feel trivial and focus to much on trivial. Like the sub stories which do help the main plot. alot of es also feels like not much is going on. I think they failed on trying space opera gene. Only few of the episodes have lot of tension and suspense which make you want to watch more.
1,It started off So well but Has gotten poor acting,"This series started off well with Stargate Universe :Air Part 1. This however is becoming what most would call Stargate Soap Opera, the drama isn't all to believable and the characters aren't either. It's also has gratuitous sex in this episode and basically it isn't needed in the Stargate Franchise. The Writers call this romance, I call it unneeded scenes. On the whole, the series has great potential but for the moment, this episode made me want to pull out a tooth or two because of the slowness in plot and character development.If the writers want to keep people attention, they should make it more believable and have more action. I will only give this series two more episodes if they don't change, I will not buy any more from this series. Dr. Gregory House :Brave Hearthas more drama and believability then SGU."
4,good filler,good series. hated to see this cancelled. i ordered this when netflix had a problem with their version of this episode.
2,DVD will not play in region 1 only PSP3,"The series is very good, the problem is that I could see only in Play Station 3 (PSP3) on my Pansonic DVD (see Note 1) from all regions I could not see it. In an old Daewoo DVD I saw the DVD 2.Note 1: Panasonic DVD-S68 HDMI 1080P Up-Converting All Multi Region Code Zone Free PAL/NTSC DVD Player. Plays DVDs from all Regions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 PAL NTSC RCE REA on ANY TV. FULL HD CONVERSION, USB Playback and REC for Music"
5,Great Deal!,Bought this for our son for Christmas. He loved being able to watch all the shows in order and on his time schedule. I would recommend this to anyone that's a Stargate Universe fan.
1,Gets Worse as Time Goes By,"I agree with the other two reviewers, this Stargate is LOST! I'm a big fan of the SG-1 & Atlantis Stargates, and I keep watching SGU hoping it gets better. No such luck, the girl on girl love scene was the worst SyFy (sic) I've ever seen.Then there was the episode ""TIME"" they're on a jungle planet, this looks promising, some good story telling maybe? Please? Then the episode ends with, I'm thinking a cliffhanger, with the second part due for the next week? No way, the next week is a completely different storyline. What happened did the writers think we won't notice this stupid writing. Then the lesbian love scene- yikes! This is not my kind of science fiction story telling.Maybe after the mid-season break the real writers will start working on making this Stargate work."
1,Water and Aliens,"With Water running low the crew have to find replacement supplies. I enjoyed the Pilot Air show but after that it has become getting worse and worse. The Characters like to complain about petty stuff. The only good Character right now is ""Eli's"" character because he has the tenacity to stand up for what he believes in.There seems to be building a ""Soap Opera"" feel, the characters are the one creating drama. The only ones that are worth mentioning is the is Col. Young and Matthew Scott when they were trying to save themselves from dieing. I admit I loved the sand alien but that along the way. I don't like how Greer is acting towards everyone or to that alien. If you love Sci-Fiction this isn't one of those shows you will sink your teeth into but it is a good filler for some time."
1,Death of a Franchise,"Worst Stargate show ever! I had mixed feelings about the fact that it got a second season. I was glad to know it was being canceled, but sad to hear that they were wasting their money on such a poor show. But that is what you get when Sci-Fi becomes Syfy.After 10 amazing seasons of SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis that ended before its time (only 5 seasons), I had high hopes for this series. By episode 2 I was disappointed, but thought ""maybe it will get better."" It didn't. To much WB channel like drama and not enough of the excitement that made Stargate such a great franchise. To top that off, they tried to shoot this like Battle Star Galactica (which I didn't like).SG:U was a sad ending to a fantastic franchise. I wish MGM and Syfy had never made this show."
2,Too Dark,"Didn't have the fun and quality characters of the original Stargate Series. These characters were too self-involved, too much unnecessary sex, very little self-discipline. Overall the characters were not people with whom I would choose to spend time. the plots didn't resolve themselves satisfactorily. Was disappointed."
4,Even entertaining for the non-Stargate fan!,"Look, I'll be honest. I think the originalStargatewas a great sci-fi movie. But the side series just never caught on with me. People went through the gate, had an adventure, then returned, ad infinitum. I'm surprised I even gave SGU: Stargate Universe a try.But I'm glad I did.The unique nature of this Stargate story is that a bunch of people, ill sorted and ill prepared, have to go through a Stargate to survive. And they find themselves on an ancient ship located... on the other side of the universe? NoStar Trek Voyagerhere, stuck 70 some years from Earth. These passengers will have to get the shipboard Stargate powered and dialed for Earth. And the eclectic nature of the part civilian, part military crew gives the screenwriters a great deal of material to work with.Interesting stuff!"
3,If you like Battlestar Galactica ...,Slow story line circa Battlestar Galactica. Seems you could miss a few weeks and still be up on the story line. I believe this continued strategy led to the series demise.
5,Loved it.,"Not really an ""official"" SG fan, but loved this. Motivated me to go back and start with SG-1. We'll see."
2,Battlestar Atlantis,"The new Stargate doesn't thrill me; it looks like a cross between Atlantis and Battlestar Galactica, played on the set of Bioshock. The first two episodes are predictable, sort of. It makes me want to play Portal. I hope someone pulls the plug on this and writes a good scifi show but keeps the music and lighting."
2,Lost Morals...,"A huge fan of all the Stargate series, until SGU came out. They lost their morals with this one and it was no longer a family show. I wished they would have kept going with the Atlantis series."
2,More drama than science fiction,The show had a lot of the right actors but suffers from a lot of whining and there isn't much adventure. This show had the right combination for huge potential but fell short due to script writing.
5,Best show ever,"My review is for them to start it back up, I mean really WTF. The first season was a little slow in the beginning but turns out to be AWESOME."
2,Stargate Universe,"I've been downloading the new show and watching it like everyone else here, and I have to say that this Stargate offshoot is different. I think the writer and directors wanted a darker Stargate show that set it apart from all the others, but in doing so they have a plot line that seems to get darker, bleaker, and in many ways more frivolous, and pointless.I am doing my best to continue to watch the show, and I have high hopes that they will somehow swing things back into alignment with the Stargate shows of the past because this new group of people, stuck on that ship they can't control, and the powerlessness of all the crew leaves very little room for a decent plot, or a story. I seriously doubt that there will be a season 2."
5,Stargate Universe,"I LOVE this series! It has very well drawn and complicated characters. It also has a wonderful ""outer space"" atmosphere that really ""takes you away"" from the ""real world.""These characters are very much like people in ""real life"" but just in a Sci Fi environment. They have the same worries, weaknesses, strengths, and ""complications"" of life that ""real people"" have.The strength of this series is in the characterization and the wonderful acting skills of this unique cast!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series!!"
1,"I love the show, but this blu ray menu is junk","so playing on the ps3 which is up to date. I cannot navigate to the episodes with any certainty, there is only the slightest intensity change to let you know what you have selected, combined with ads at the beginning and tons of non-skippable warnings/disclaimers it takes about 5-10 minutes to select an episode to watch, more if you can't pickup the slight brightness change of the menu.The show however is the best sci-fi space show I have seen, but the menu design is horrendous"
5,A great yarn from beginning to the end.,"I got this for my grandson and we watched all the episodes over a period of two weeks. Robert Caryle anchors the series for certain but the other actors were very good also. So we, like many others, hope more seasons will be added."
5,"Once a skeptic, now a fan","I've tried watching SG1 and never could get into it, but with Stargate Universe it's a whole ballgame now. The series reminds me of the best parts of the new BSG series. More gritty and believable than the previous Stargate series."
2,Missed the boat!,"Boring! Writers sure missed a great opportunity. Ancient ship hurling through space, out of control, on an unknown course, and unknown purpose, with trapped people, gates, worlds, aliens, and ships, perfect setup! A small budget must have forced the ever-repeating, episode-after-episode, same limited focus on personal strife and conflict. Come on, you can be a little more creative, even with a limited budget. There is a big old Ancient ship to explore, so explore it. There are mysteries to solve, so solve a few. There are worlds to explore, so explore them. Really, the cubes transporting people back and forth from the ship to earth is a low budget, low imagination cop out."
5,Awesome Series,"This has to be one of the best SciFi series out there right now. It shouldn't have been canceled so early in it's life. Amazing acting, great story, and insane production skills. Someone else should pick this series up!"
3,A SGU Preview,"This trailer for Stargate Universe (SGU) is a good preview for the upcoming season of this next installment in the Stargate franchise. I watched this preview before seeing the two-part first episode (see my full review there) and was pleased that it didn't give too much away, while providing just enough to get my interest.CFH"
4,Potential missed.,"StarGate Universe reminds me of StarGate Atlantis that had so much potential that was missed. When did we start making TV shows that had more action in them than story lines. Here we have a great premise for a story line that could go on for years. However, starting with the first episode there was no back story which leave us confused. That is support to happen. However, I'm half way through the first season and I'm still trying to figure that part out. I wish they did like the Avengers movie and did a lot of background with a good amount of action. Maybe they need to find the MASH writers for help. Still worth the watch because it will be referred to in future StarGate movies or series. I'm just glad Ben Browder wasn't in it. He was good in FarScape, yet he sucked in StarGate."
4,A NEW ERA,We as a family have become intrigued by this cast of characters. It is a refreshing new take on the original show. It is somewhat more mysterious & unpredictable which makes you wanting to see what is going to happen next.
2,good view but many problems,"the first tv set I got didn't work. then customer service replaced it. now, 3 months later, I have occasional squeaks and whistles - not sure yet what to do.also, if you are planning on connecting it to an amplifier, there is a grave problem in muting the internal speakers. You can mute them, but once you turned the tv off, this setting is lost and you need to do it again next time you start it"
5,great slippers,"I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas 08, she loves them., The quality was great, they fit well and are all sorts of warm and cozy!!"
4,Warm and Cozy Woolrich Scuff Slippers,"Very good purchase; wanted slipper for indoor and/or outdoor wear; shopped on Amazon and selection was made. Delivery was prompt, but condition was questionable, sticky substance on side of one slipper, didn't hamper wearability; mentioned to customer service, just to be aware...incident probably isolated. CS acknowledged & solution was reached; would order again. Thanks Amazon - this is good shopping!"
4,The Dogs are pleased,Both Grand-dogs love this product and the price was very good. The packages keep fresh until the dogs are here and I am ready to share.
1,this is SO BAD for dogs!,How can anyone love their pet and feed stuff like this? Read the ingredients! BAD NEWS!!!! Go research what you are doing to your pets giving them this stuff! People just don't know!
2,Where are these made,"I wish they would indicate where these treats are made. DO you really want to give your dog anything made in China. If its not fit for human consumption how can it be good for your dog. Of course my dog loves these treats, But I wont buy again until and unless they indicate they are made in the USA"
1,Poison,"This product contains propylene glycol and BHA which is poisonous to dogs. Look it up. We threw away a $20.00 bag of pup peroni tonight. Our dog began having seizures after we started a training class with her where they recommended using pup peroni. We used the pup peroni as a training treat as recommend. Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures, she was placed on seizure medication. We completed the class, we stopped with the pup peronis. We just purchased another pup, and began training with him. Because he was getting the pup peronis, so was the 2 year old dog and she began having seizures again. In researching this, we found there is a link between pup peroni (propylene glycol) and seizures. Poisoning....Buyer beware."
2,OK - Seems to have all. No index. Mostly romaji,"I read the reviews carefully, and thought this is it. As a beginner with 4 years of reading, I was disappointed that there was no index, even though it is arranged alphabetically. Verb structure is sketchy and I have to look elsewhere for details. As usual the extensive use of romaji and in some places only romaji lowers this book and wastes a lot of my time. I prefer kanji along with furigana or kana helps. I would pay 4 times the amount to get those details included. But I don't know where to go. But this book does give some help along with pretty good particle, preposition and other syntax details. I could not use this book at all without help from the Monash editor."
5,A nearly-perfect grammatical reference,"This book bears a strong similarity to A Handbook of Japanese Usage, but differs in a few ways - this book focuses more on larger grammatical terms than the other - for example, this book has an entry for 'ni chigai nai' - 'it must be', whereas the other has entries for smaller terms and particles, such as 'ni' and 'nai'. Therefore, I have also found this book to be useful and interesting as a language learning resource, while the other is more useful as a reference.A Handbook of Japanese Grammar is structured like a dictionary, with alphabetical entries, and example sentences given for each one to detail their possible usages. This is quite a valuable book. Note: The system of romanization used here is the Hepburn system."
3,Fall short as a handbook,"This book has its strenght in simplicity. But it is only worth its price, not a good handbook. The explanation is too sketchy. There are mistakes, which are very annoying. Some intended cross references are broken (eg. entry ""A"", see ""B"". When you turn to entry ""B"", there is no mention of the relation of ""B"" to ""A"" whatsoever). The use of Romanji only in parts of the book is a waste of resource. I hope that the author can fix these problems in future revised editions."
1,This Ought To Be Illegal!!!!! Can I Give Out Negative Stars???,"More repackaged garbage from the same awful people. My review of the previous album is copied below.I'm a To-The-Core Diana Krall fan. While I knew this album wasn't her playing I thought I'd hear some new interpretations of her stuff. The selections are simply AWFUL; poor musicianship, out of tune, don't swing AT ALL, etc. Of course if you look at what this group has also done, such as ""String Quartet Tribute to Nine Inch Nails"", you realize these folks are just out to make a buck on other people's art without ANY of their own.This is one of the worst music purchases I've ever made, (and I've made thousands). It's so bad it's funny but too painful to listen to more than once.If you get a chance to listen to this bit of drivel, go ahead but under NO circumstances should you pay money for the privilege."
2,Fumble-a-thon,"The graphics look awesome and all the extra's are really nice, but the gameplay leaves alot to be desired. What is the deal with all the fumbles? The first game I played was good for the first half, but something happened after half-time and EVERY time I even touched the ball, I fumbled. I fumbled on kick-off's, my running back fumbled,my wide receivers all fumbled, and my quarterback fumbled. There was even one play where I completed a pass downfield, my receiver was hit and fumbled(surprise), the defense picked it up, I tackled them and they fumbled, my offensive lineman recovered,was hit and he fumbled. I was not even using the turbo button(which is supposed to make it easier to fumble). That is NOT fun! Eliminate the fumbling, and you've got a great game!"
1,this is terrible,This game is pretty awful. Gameplay is lousy and offers nothing new over previous versions of the game. I played one game and fumbled 17 times and the CPU fumbled 14 times. The computer assistance is ridiculous when you get up by 10 points or more.
4,"Interesting thesis, well written book","Downing makes a strong and easy to follow argument that European governments were able to support the modern standing armies of the 17th and 18th centuries only by destroying decentralized proto-representative institutions inherited from medieval times and taking direct control of taxation, conscription, and military leadership. Such governments then developed into autocracies, whereas, in countries that either didn't need large standing armies or were able to support those armies by plunder rather than taxation, the medieval institutions survived and eventually developed into democracies. The argument is backed by interesting, although brief, comparitive historical analyses of Prussia, France, Britain, Poland, Holland, and Sweden. Personally, I wasn't entirely convinced, but Downing is an unusually clear and concise writer and knows his stuff, so it's worth deciding for yourself."
5,What a Gem!!,"This is an exceptional book. Easy to understand, gets you involved and interested in a subject that might scare a few away.I love it and often go back to remind myself of the basics."
4,technical but informative,the book was very informative. i learned a lot. but it took me forever to get through it. very technical. dont try to read it if your tired! the the information is worth the effort.
3,God can't possibly be laughing with Tahira...But...,"I was greatly disappointed in the content and profanity. The cover presentation is appealing, but I expected more substance, more direction, and to some extent, guidance.It's cool, hip and soulful, but certainly not spiritual."
2,NOT GOOD,"I thought the book to be way to confusing. I could not understand all of the different ""worm holes"" ""worm cams"" and stuff. I was really disapointed. I am also not a very big fan of sci-fiction which may of also contributed to my thoughts about the book. Not a imagination catcher."
2,"Interesting Ideas, Poor Execution.","The idea of being able to spy on people, and history, via wormholes is an interesting idea. Seeing how people would deal with such an extreme loss of privacy is dealt with somewhat well.As a whole, however, the book is little more than an interesting idea. The problem is the human element. The authors paid more attention to the way that the technology in the story is portrayed than the characters. As a result, none of the characters really pop out at you or seem very textured.Also, with the various wormhole excursions into the past, I agree with an earlier reviewer that the authors would've been better off showing us these excursions rather than telling us about them. Those scenes come off with all the charm of a lab report.If this book were a movie, I would say wait till it's broadcast on network television."
2,Should have been better,"The premise of this book is interesting. Imagine a technology based on quantum mechanics that allows the viewing across time and space. First, there is no privacy and no secrets. How would society react to that? Second, imagine the technology allows the same access to the past. Did Jesus exist? Was Lincoln an idealist or a pragmatist?Within this intersting premise the authors use a shotgun approach to examine/trivialize the environment, religion, and a myriad of other subjects. The book is not focused (a typical problem with many cooperative ventures). Also, the book seems to be written to a high-school reader.An interesting story torpedoed by unfocused writting."
3,"A thought provoking idea, but . . .","The whole concept of being able to look across space or back into time is almost mindboggling. What do you look at first?! The book is a good read, just because of the underlying concept. However, the concept is like a ""Pandora's box,"" once opened so many things come flying out it is hard to address any of the implications in detail, and the authors don't. The characters are flat, and many intriguing ideas are tossed to the reader but then never fully developed. The ending is very sudden and seems out of step with the rest of the book. I had the strange feeling that the authors grew weary of the book, didn't know exactly where it was going and just ended it."
5,Gave as A Gift,Gave this to a huge sci-fi and space opera fan. A great gift and a holiday success. Yay for this book.
2,"good idea, but thats about it","I have enjoyed Clarke at times. 'City and the Stars,' or Rendezvous with Rama.' This idea here is a great one, looking back in time with the use of a worm hole. I also like his further exploration of ideas explored in 'Childhoods End.' What you have here is one of the two most important aspects of Science Fiction portrayed in all of its magnificence. A good idea to wrap the story around. But the characters or the means these two authors use to get the idea across feels academic. Because of the stiffness and secondary nature of the story, it is almost unreadable.If you want a good story, skip this book. If you are looking for a great science fiction idea, this is a five star read."
1,Art Clarke used to be great.,"I've read Clarke for decades. His older novels were fascinating as were his short stories. Light of Other Days is tiresome as are his other newer novels. He seems to have ""used up"" his new ideas. If you truly wish to enjoy Clarke, start with any of his short story collections and then Childhood's End. This book isn't worth the time at any price."
2,Stick to the solo novels,I am a big fan of Clarke's work but if seems the novels that are co-written are his worst. These all lack the straight forward no nonsence approach Clarke uses in his novels. Too much rambling and useless character subplots. Stick to his solo work.
2,Not Mad - Just Disappointed,"While not a bad read, I think the book tried to cover way too much ground in 300 pages. The treatment of issues was superficial and the authors seemed to be trying to cram as many interesting topics as possible into one book. As a result the characters were underdeveloped and their relationships were not well defined."
2,Too many subjects with too shallow a treatment,"When I purchased this book, I thought that the idea of a ""time viewer"" was very interesting, and that a novel based on this idea should be captivating. After having read the book, I am still convinced it is a very interesting idea, but not as treated here! First, I don't see the point of mixing the ""time viewer"" story with other developments(the Wormwood, the head implants) that have nothing to do with it. Second, the book looks more like a first draft of a script rather than a book. Characters are shallow at best. There is no real story, only a minimalist plot designed to cover as many consequences of the ""distance/time viewer"" as possible. I am wondering whether the two authors have even tried to put their ideas together and to select the best among them, rather than each adding his first thoughts on this novel. Don't waste your time and money on this superficial SF script!"
3,good story but the end was a letdown,"when i started this book i really thought it would finish itself up better than this. i haven't read much of clarke's work but from what i have read i expected better. the thought of viewing the past, while not original to this story, did spark my intrest. especially the ideas about the evolution of present day lfe on earth brought up in the end of the book. but other than that i found the majoriy of the book to really be a letdown."
1,Grand concepts but very disappointing story - dreary book,"I have always liked Clarke. But this one is a major disappointment. This book is long on concepts, but there isn't much story, and the characters never really come to life. The easiest indicator of this is that, in the last 10% or so of the book, not one of the characters does anything more than watch time scroll backwards millions of years. And then the book ends. Seriously.Most stories have some type of problem that gets resolved, and the characters get caught up in the problem and its resolution. Not this book, really.So, if you like concept and description, and can enjoy it despite relatively tedious action by not-too-interesting characters, then read this book. Otherwise, I suggest finding another book."
3,Reading Arthur Clarke for ideas,"Context and purpose matter in effectively reading a book. You don't read Jane Austin for social and political details of the Napoleonic Wars; you read her for fine-grained and highly ironic character development. By the same token, you don't read Arthur Clarke for character or plot development; you read him for prophetic insights and ideas that solidly extrapolate frontier scientific thinking. Thus, to criticize him for flawed characters and plots is to miss the point and lose the opportunity to extend your point of view about the world and the implications of current technological trends."
1,Don't trust that your cat will be safely confined in this carrier!,"The crate itself is OK, but the door makes this product not worth buying. The door is made of plastic that is quite easy to bend or break. You should not trust your cat to be secure in this carrier...you will be worrying that the door will fail and the cat will escape. Terrible crate...one of the worst ones I've seen. In general, crates with plastic doors tend to be poorly made."
3,OK for the money,"This pet carrier is not the most fancy nor sturdy carrier out there. But I only use them to take a cat to the vet. Since I only use this twice a year, it does the job fine. Worth the cheap price if you don't need a first-class carrier."
3,Not so much,"This crate does not have the two tabs you squeeze together to open the door. They are separate and near impossible to open with one hand. This is particularly difficult when you have the puppy in the other hand. I find this to be very frustrating. Fortunately, she will grow out of it soon and I won't make the same mistake again.Good luck."
1,No star animal carrier,"It is a piece of junk. I would never advise anyone to buy it. The old saying, ""You get what you pay for."" Except it isn't worth even $5.00"
4,A true Southern Tale,Love her style of writing and the characters are just like people I have known myself. A dash of mystery and a whole lot of homespun dialogue made for an enjoyable read.
3,SC Girl,"This is an easy read, but the characters are loosely defined characters. The main character has had an incident occur in her life that is never explained...I'm wondering why not? This is only the second book I've ready by Augusta Trobaugh - the other one being Sophie and the Rising Sun and it was excellent."
4,liked it....sort of,"I liked the ""idea"" of this product. The only problem I have with it is that it is too sensitive. My son is 1 year old and when he touches it, it repeats and repeats. The recommendations are to touch with one finger which is almost impossible because he likes to touch the textures (like he is petting). Otherwise, it is a good toy."
3,Note the age of your child,"My baby boy is 11 months old. This device failed to grab his attention. A slight touch of the page causes a ""rap-song"" like effect of the narrator's voice. I had to supervise my child while turning the pages like any regular book. Perhaps in a few months my lil Einstein will appreciate this 60$ investment w books."
1,frustration frustration frustration!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I researched last year at xmass the leap pad and was so excited that fisher price, a brand i love, had come out with a reasonable priced baby one. It was new on the market and there were no reviews yet on it so i went with my gut and bought a brand name that i have trusted, and was i disapointed. I have now a 1 year old and a 3 yr old and they get so frustrated with it it is too sensitve to the touch. IT not only drives them nuts but me too. The only some what good part of it is when the book is out there is a music section that works some of the time. My daughter who i bought it for uses it as a small step stool to see over her gate. I do not recommend this toy at all. THe developers of this toy had a great idea but did not take the time to research what they had made."
3,Just stick with old fashioned books,"I just tried the PTB with my 8 mo old daughter. It is easy enough for her to touch but almost too easy. It sounds like a broken record. She would never learn a thing from it at this point. I have also tried the Leap Pad baby and it isn't any better. I am pretty convinced that this product is really meant for a child who is older and can understand the concept of pointing and waiting. I think I will return it and wait til she is older to try again. I really wanted it to work, it is a great idea."
2,To sensitive,"I bought this for my 12 month old for Christmas. It is way too sensitive for his little hands. It repeats everything because he wants to ""pet"" the book. My husband and I wish that we bought the Leap pad version instead. I hope that my son eventually grows into it. Meanwhile, we have to listen to the ""rapping""."
3,Great idea but doesn't really work out,I bought this product because it was easy to use and appropriate for a young child. I found that the book is sooooo sensitive that it is very difficult to get any real educational use out of it. Little babies touch everything. It is hard to get them to even listen to what they just pressed without touching something else. This makes the first sound stop and cuts to the new sound. It repeats like crazy. My daughter was still unable to manage this toy on her own at 2 years old. It really is easier to just sit down and read a book to your child. The books that go with this unit are not cheap either. Overall I wouldn't waste my money on this product.
1,Terrible,"Our son was given this last year for Christmas. At the time, he was much too young for it, so I put it away until he was about 9 months old. It does work with an easy touch. So easy, in fact, that I believe if the wind blew hard on one of the books it would play about 5 different noises. At nearly 15 months old, he still doesn't understand that he needs to touch gently or have the coordination to touch one small spot.Do yourselves a favor and sit down with your children and READ real books to them instead of wasting your money on this product. I think they get more out of it."
3,Power Touch - Great Idea but...,"other than the two starter books, there are not any other books available. If FP wants this electronic book reader to compete with Leap Pad, I suggest they develop additional books for the Power Touch pronto!My grandson is 2 and I was looking to purchase additional stories for his Power Book. I am truly disappointed there are none available. If I am wrong, please let me know. Thanks!"
3,Not so good for little ones,"I bought my daughter this for Christmas when she was 8 months old. She is now 17 months old and we can't use it still, she won't give the system time to speak. She touches other buttons in excitement before the words can get out. Her attention and patience isn't where it would need to be yet for this toy to work well. It is too frustrating to try and go through the books with her now. Not a bad toy, but I think that it is more appropriate for preschoolers, they should consider changing the age range for this toy 6 months - 2 years doesn't seem accurate to me. ** added** My daughter is now 2 and still can't be patient long enough for the thing to get the words out before she pushes another button. I really think the concept is a good one and the quality of the product is good, I am going to keep bringing it out until we find an age it will work for us."
2,Great idea...Not such a great toy,"My sister bought this for my son on his 2nd birthday. He LOVES picture books and Learn Through Music Interactive Learning System(it's by Mattel - a GREAT toy). She did the research and thought this was something he would love. Sorry, but it is not the case. First, the pages are not sturdy enough. Second, it is much too sensitive, and that makes it difficult to get thru an entire story coherently. Lastly, it kept turning off - I guess the switch on the back is sensitive, too.Needless to say, he never uses it. I mean NEVER. I rotate his toys to make sure there aren't too many to choose from. This could be the only toy for him to play with, and he will not touch it.I love Fisher-Price, but I think they missed the mark on this one."
3,Not for babies,"They call this power touch ""baby"" but it is definately not for babies. The book falls off if the child wants to walk around with it and the touch points are way too sensitive. It will just repeat itself over and over which is frustrating for the child and parent. The books are sturdy and it is a good concept, just not for the 6 month old like they recommend. I would say 16 months and up. My daughter is 18 months old and, after trying for 10 months, we can just now enjoy this toy together."
1,Not for Babies at all,"Great idea for a toy and I was all excited to get it. The touch with 1 finger just does not work with a baby though. It is very hard for me to find any educational value for my son he is so eager to explore that will touch each item so fast that it just repeats over and over again. As soon as he touches a new thing it moves on without completing the first item. The books come out way to easy and my son has even figured out how to pull out the chip. Also when there is no book or chip in and it should be just in the music mode it keeps refering back to Baby Bunnies (the book that came with it.) Also I don't like that there is a power touch baby and then a bigger power touch. I bought my son a Clifford book (his favorite) I was very disapointed to learn it didn't work for or fit my Power Touch ""BABY"" I'm going to have to put this toy away and hope that maybe when he is closer to preschool age he will find it more interesting and be better able to play with it."
4,"Not a great fit for my ""baby""","Guess I will have to wait until my little man (14 months) gets a little older to use this system the way its supposed to be used as he insists on touching everything at the same time and you can't even finish a page, much less the entire story. Maybe if I had started this earlier before he could touch it himself? Right now we only use the musical part, none of the books at this time."
2,Too Sensitive,"I thought this would be great for my 8 month old son. However, he is teething and drools alot and when this gets wet it doesn't work properly. Also the base with the keyboard on it is paper. When I cleaned off the drool the paper started to rub off. I expected better from Fisher-Price. It does start to freeze up if too many items are touched at once and you have to reset it often. My nephew has a Leap Pad and it seems much better."
2,get the other one,"I have tried both Littletouch LeapPad and this one. We originally got the LeapPad as a gift. I tried it and returned it to get the Fisher Price unit. I wanted the tactile features - like the fur and cloth figures. It was supposed to be easier to activate the next page as well. Those features were good but the sound quality on the Fisher Price Power Touch Baby is AWFUL!! I went and got another one and that one was crap also. The Power Touch Baby is way too sensitive also. You dont even have to touch a picture to activate it, just get close to it. I returned it and went back to the LeapPad."
1,Not a very good toy for a baby,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old son and it stopped working properly after 3 days. The speaker system in it is messed up and the buttons are too sensitive on it. It is not a very good toy for the little ones who like to push more than one thing at once. I usually love their toys, but I was extremely disappointed with this one. I think you would be better off spending your money on a more durable, less annoying toy."
2,Not a good choice,"My son recieved this for christmas when he was 9 months old, he couldnt play with it then, so I pulled it out when he was 15 months. Its really sensitve to touch and drives me insane with all the talking, it is very confusing for him. I would not recomend this toy at all."
1,Hated this toy. We never use it because.....,"...it is too sensitive. You don't even have to touch a picture for the voice to go off. As a result, each blurb gets interrupted when baby moves their fingers around (which they obviously would do). Also, everytime you turn it on, it advertised 'Fisher Price Power Touch Baby' which is annoying. In retrospect, I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this thing."
5,"If you use Windows XP, then you can't do better","Windows XP's amazing abilities are revealed by Guy Hart-Davis in The XP Files: Windows' Hidden Tools for Secure Sharing, Communication, and Collaboration. The XP Files reveals just how to best master and implement the full range of powerful, secure (and hidden) Internet communication tools within XP.

2,poor quality,"First off, like almost all after market products for Jeeps, the instructions are lousy. There is absolutely no way to install it following the sequence of actions as listed (although it's fairly easy when you work it out for yourself). Next, an essential strap just broke right off when I tugged on it to tighten. Third, it's too stiff for a diaper and I can't think what else it might be good for."
1,Very short.disappointing racing game,I have only played a demo.OK. So the graphics are the best you could wish in fgor a game that costs a little. I played it in the ARCADES. Unfortanely the handling is terrible. and having 3 tracks and 2 cars. Automatic or Manual. means you'll only play this 1 time. AVOID
3,A Good Game to Test Your Skills,"I was very impressed by the graphics and high-resolution cars included with this game. The racing is very realistic, including damages done to your car. The only dissapoitment was only having three tracks to race on. I would recommend this game to the gamer who lovers arcade-style games."
2,Smaller than indicated,"The quality isn't what it used to be on these carriers, but they're okay for the price. However, the actual usable space for your pet is a lot less than what you'd think, given the measurements provided. The walls angle down so much that the actual floor width, instead of the 18.6 inches stated, is only 11 inches, so you can't fit as big an animal in here as you'd think."
1,cheap and small,"bought this crate thinking that ""large"" actually meant large. the plastic is thin and flimsy. i wouldn't recommend it for anything larger than a toy breed of dog. It buckled under the weight of my puppy. The closing mechanism for each half is very cheap. The gate is cheap metal. I tried to return it but the shipping- even the cheapest offered by UPS- is far more expensive than the price of the crate- $75!"
2,"Petmate 21277 Kennel Cab Fashion Pet Carrier, Large",it was well constructed but not as large as it appeared. I had to return itbecause my pupp who is a sheapard was too large for it already. Perfect for a small breed dog.
1,Not Adequate for it's Purpose,"Very flimsy construction, and not adequte to handle a ""large"" dog, or anything much else. Actual dimensions smaller than advertised. The latches which are supposed to hold it together...don't. I don't reccommend this product."
1,UNSAFE FOR YOUR PET - DO NOT BUY,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PET CARRIER!!!!! I have a small one of these for taking my cat to the vet and when i was bringing him home last time the carrier fell into two pieces (because there are not bolts or anything holding the two halves together) and I nearly lost my cat. The shock of falling when the carrier fell apart scare my cat and he ran off. I had to chase him around the parking lot and finally was able to drag him out from underneath a car. I got on here and wrote this out of concern for other people's animals. Please do not buy this carrier, you have a very good chance of it coming apart and you losing your animal. VERY CHEAP DESIGN and VERY UNRELIABLE!!!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Pet carrier,Note this says large pet carrier. Bought this for medium size dog. Got it home maybe good for a large cat. Not what I thought it was.
1,MINI PET CARRIER,"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN QUALITY AND IN SIZE< Large Really means SMALL ... said item would be beagle or schnauzer size, NOT. There is nothing Large about it unless you are a ""CAT"". CHEAP Quality plastic as well, would return but not worth spending the extra money to do so. Guess i should have known to buy in store and not online."
1,Not Happy,"I ordered a large dog kennel, i received my package today and it is not a large! i have a medium dog kennel already that i am wanting to upgrade because my pup has out grown it so i ordered a large kennel in replace of it, and my medium dog kennel is bigger that the ""large kennel"" they sent me i am very unsatisfied with this purchase! they portrayed a ""large kennel"" and its smaller than a medium! a large dog kennel has the measurements of/or about ( 36 x 24 x 27 inches ) and the cage they sent me saying is a large kennel has the measurements of ( 26.15 x 18.56 inches )"
3,"Well made, but too small","This crate seemed to be well made and arrived in good shape, but was still too small for our cocker spaniel and/or our beagle. We ended up being able to print a receipt from Petco and exchanged it in store without a problem. It would be helpful to have example breeds listed in the product description to help with the ordering process."
4,VERY NICE CAGE,"I bought this for my 15 lb min pin. If you make sure to read the information it will tell you the size of dog and size of cage that it's for. She has started having accidents in her cage so I like the quick clasps so I can remove the top to clean the cage instead of nuts & bolts like others have. It is very lightweight & has a carrying handle which are a great addition, and even though I probably wont use it, the seatbelt slot is a great addition too. The only negatives are the bottom is slippery so when my dog goes in she has slipped, the bottom half is a dark color so it's a little hard to see if she had an accident and the door does not stay open. All of these made me list it as 4 stars instead of 5, overall I'm very happy with it and recommend it."
4,Fine Kennel,"This is a fine lightweight kennel. Our small 14lb dog fits in it perfectly.The door is a bit flimsy, by that I mean the pins that insert into the top and bottom of the box dont always line up with their holes, and you bend the plastic cage slightly to make it fit. No real problem with that, but it is a bit flimsy."
1,Buyer beware - Don't waste your money - Item received not as described .,"Plastic hindges don't line up - you have to muscle your way to assemble this. The metal gate has a lock with bent pegs as handles. The hindges are not long enough to attach to the crate so it is very, very, very easy for your pet to get out. Don't buy this ! If you want to throw your money away - do something good with it instead like donate it to the Red Cross or Doctors without Borders."
2,Beware: Airlines will not allow shipping with this crate,"Beware this kennel is not airline approved despite claim in description. Airlines require that top and bottom screw together.Additionally, given shape, this kennel was so small on bottom that could not ship golden retriever puppy of 9 weeks in it."
2,Flimsy,"This carrier worked great when my cat was a baby and only weighed 2 lbs, but now that he is 10 lbs this carrier is falling apart! The plastic is too thin so the top bows out when you lift it by the handle, which subsequently results in the door hinge falling out of position, then the door swings open and the cat escapes. The only way to avoid this is to hold the carrier from the bottom, which is extremely awkward. Yes this is cheaper than most carriers, but you'll end up spending more money in the long run because you'll have to buy another (sturdier) carrier very soon."
2,Large is very small,"Do not buy this if you a jack russel sized dog +. I have a small Jack Russel Terrier she is about 16lbs, poor thing it was way too small for her and short in height too! She could'nt even sit down unless she had her neck bent down. And I was close to buying the intermediate size she probly would'nt have been able to even walk into that one. Well, since I originally bought it at Petsmart I was able to return it and get a full refund. I gave it 2 stars cause it was the cutest kennel out of all the others."
3,Too small and a little flimsy,"I had to return this carrier since it was too small for our 15 pound rat terrier to use. We should have ordered the next size up. I was also not happy with the construction. I did not intend to ship our boy in the crate, but if I had, I would have worried about it coming apart at the side clips. If you do purchase it to ship, you might try some zip ties to secure the sides."
3,"Good Kennel, Wrong Color","The Kennel is great! its sturdy and well made for the price. However, the color is falsely advertised, it is not blue/cream it is actually a brown/camel color. And i was pretty dissapointed when I received it"
4,Great kennel for the price!,"Kennel is very nice, although its not quite as big as the description says. But it works."
2,Bloody Mess,"I was given this cat carrier from a friend when she no longer had a use for it. I have a 14 pound cat, give or take, that fits in it easily with plenty of room to curly up and move around. The snaps are secure enough, though sometimes it takes a power house to undo them. The door is a bit flimsy and has popped out at the top a few times on vet trips. My main issue is with the air holes on the side. Being this product is made of hard plastic, that in combination with an unhappy cat, results in a bloody mess. During the entire 15 or so minute car ride to the vets my cat continuously claws at the holes. This results in nails splitting and flinging all over the place, which in turn causes him to start bleeding. It is not a pretty sight. I now refuse to use this case and am looking into purchasing a soft case to prevent him from clawing at the air holes."
1,Not safe,"Buyer beware! I bought this for my sheltie pup, and he got out of it. We have to put something heavy on top like a box so he wont get out of it. It is not sturdy enough and if we wernt at home who knows what would of happend!! I will always use the ones with the screws from now on. It wasnt going to be the main one I just wanted it since I just got him and the kennel we had wasn't put together."
3,TOO SMALL FOR A 20 LB JACK RUSSELL,OR MAYBE JUST WAS TOO RAMBUNCTIOUS...LOL...EITHER WAY...I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS KENNEL FOR JACK RUSSELLS OR DOG NEAR OR OVER 20 LBS
2,My dumb dog can get out of it.,"Poorly made. My dog, who isn't even bright, has figured out how to get out of it (and destroy the house). Waste of money."
3,Define Large,"While the carrier is stronger than a cardboard box, I would not call it sturdy. Also, if my job were to write short product descriptions, I would not use the word large. We've got a 22 lb. dog who looks at us accusingly when we have her squeeze into this medium size kennel. We only use it for short car trips. Not large at all."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Certainly inexpensive and does contain a pet. However, the plastic is thin and cheap, the workmanship is poor and the door does not stay open unless propped. If you're looking for a crate to go the distance and live at least as long as your pet, get a high-quality metal cage crate or a pricier heavy-duty plastic one."
2,Not for travel,"With this carrier, you get what you pay for. The latches on ours will not stay locked; you cannot lift it by the handle. That is not a problem for us because we got it as a sleeping compartment for our dog. But it would NOT be usable for traveling."
3,this is a large?,"This is a very solid product. It is assembles quickly, and stays together. However watch out. While it say ""Large"", it is made for very small dogs."
1,ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PAYING MORE FOR A CHEAPER PRODUCT!,"I have an older Petmate Carrier exactly like this PetMate 21277 Kennel Cab I just bought. The older carrier is a MEDIUM sized carrier that's probably 6-7 years old. It's sturdy and the plastic is thicker and much firmer than this one I just bought. The new carrier I just received was advertised as ""large"". It is not! It's the same size as my old one. This is another example of how American manufacturers are making huge profits at the expense of the consumer. They raise the price on their products and at the same time make them out of much cheaper materials. Their bottom line comes out just great. My bottom line? I'm $34 poorer with a product that doesn't work!! This carrier is useless, made of flimsy, cheap plastic. The carrier won't stay together as it's constructed. I'm not going thru the trouble of trying to return this abomination. I'll try to jerry-rig it to work. This purchase makes me NOT likely to buy any more products from Amazon."
1,"Not what I consider ""Large""",This crate is advertised as LARGE but it was not. Once we received the crate (great delivery speed!) we were shocked at the small size... perhaps a beagle would fit inside it but we do not consider a beagle a large dog. We feel this should be advertised as a MEDIUM size (if that). We went to our local Tractor Supply and bought a LARGE dog crate there - it was about twice the size and is really a LARGE dog crate.
4,Decent quality,"I bought this as a temporary solution for my Labrador Retriever puppy for crate training. He has since grown out of it but it did the job well and the price was reasonable. The plastic is a bit thin but when assembled, it is fairly sturdy. The description Large is a bit misleading because it's really rather small. Check the dimension specifications before ordering. The door would not stay open, so I fixed that by installing a small coil spring between the door and a hole that I drilled in the plastic. That worked great. Considering the relatively low cost, it's a good value and I would recommend it"
1,NOT WORTH IT,"I received this cage as a Christmas gift from my Sister who meant well but unfortunately it didn't work out. The plastic on this unit is very lightweight and the door comes off very easily. I don't like the snap on features to hold the carrier together as they have opened up on me several times. The real big issue is the door. It does not stay in place and falls out of the mounting holes I have a Sheltie that is around 14lbs and this does not even support her. This is not a large cage as advertised but a medium one. Bottom line, if you just want a cage in the house that will remain stationary, get it but don't transport with it. I recommend this cage very highly:http://www.amazon.com/Petmate-Kennel-Fashion-Bleached-Peacock/dp/B00063KG64/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-supplies&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1299996956&sr;=1-2If you can find it in a large or medium, it will do the job and not fall apart."
4,A great step up from the Apple standard,"I read a review about these somewhere -- New York Times? Airline magazine? -- and decided to try them out. Night and day from the standard Apple white earbuds. These lodge inside the ear (once you chose your right size from the three sizes of rubber covers), and block out most of the outside noise. Inside in a quiet room you hear details of your music you've never noticed before; in the gym, on the street or in the subway you can listen to your music without distractions. I have a set of the very expensive Bose noise-cancelling earphone which I'm going to leave behind next time I take a plane trip. Only gripe is that the cord is thinner and more kink-prone than Apple's ubiquitous white iTunes cord and has a cheap feel. If you've paid your $150+ for an iPod you should invest in a pair of these and hear all the music has to offer."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased these after reading one of the previous reviews claiming they are a good step above the Apple. NOT TRUE!!!First of all, they are very uncomfortable. The ipod earphones are like heaven compared to these. Even the cord itself. You cannot adjust the cord at all on these earphones. The left earphone has a really long cable and the right one is much shorter. They aren't even even.Next, the sound. There is NO BASS. The original ipod phones gave much more bass. These sound like you're listening to your grandpa's old radio. There is virtually no bass.STAY CLEAR OF THIS PRODUCT. I actually bought these at Walmart for $18. Complete waste of money. I'm using my standard earphones in the gym with the ipod."
2,What bass?,"I do not understand how they have the nerve to put anything about ""good bass"" in the technical and product descriptions for this item. I got these to replace my Koss Sparkplug earphones, and what a disappointment! My old Sparkplugs have pretty darn good bass response, but they are kind of a hassle to get into the ear. When I first put in these Koss KEB24 earbuds I was *ecstatic* over how well they fit into my ears and how easy they are to put in. I thought: man, with such a good fit these are sure bound to sound great! Wrong. Once I tried listening to some bass-heavy mp3s--big letdown! If you want good bass--stay away! Even with the lousy fit the Sparkplugs had much better bass. I'm new to this type of earbud so I'll have to keep searching for something better."
2,"Amazing sound, until it breaks","I've been usingKoss ""The Plug"" Portable Headphones (colors vary)forever. When I saw these headphones I was so excited and when I got them I was amazed by the sound. But two weeks later the right plug stopped working properly.I thought maybe I had just got a bad pair, but when I bought another pair the same thing happened again. You want some great earbuds, go forKoss ""The Plug"" Portable Headphones (colors vary)."
3,Good sun salutation/basic warmup,"I did yoga many years ago and picked this video up at Ross. The intro is kind of decieving...I was expecting more of a workout- this is a short (maybe 15-20 minute) yoga warm up, which is pretty ideal for the advanced beginner/intermediate student.If you are comfortable doing sun salutations on your own, you could probably skip it, however, I enjoyed the video- it's just the mellow ticket I needed before bed. Not too strenuous, not too easy. =) I just wish it had been longer."
4,20 minute basic yoga,"This is a very simple yet worthwhile yoda dvd. I love it because in one half hour I can get in a good stretch. I allow ten minutes to setup and the actual workout is only 20 minutes. While Yoga officianotos may think it too little, time is always an issue and everyone can usually get a half hour to squeeze this in. I have chronic lower back issues and if I do this dvd 3 times a week I a fine. I purchased one for every mother in my book club!"
3,Not For Beginners,"This is definitely not a basic yoga instruction. If you've never tried Yoga you might find a lot of what the instructors do in this video a bit difficult. However, all yoga is supposed to be comfortable, so you can strive to get as close as you can to what you see on the screen and in a few short weeks you'll find yourself getting even closer to what it looks like on your television. Just be warned that you should never push yourself, you can wind up stretching out your muscles to the point where it's painful to move, or worse, tearing something. With that in mind it's still a good instructional video that uses a good set of repetition to make the work out interesting and engaging."
3,An American Modern Christmas Carol,"There are several versions of ""A Christmas Carol"", and even if this may not be called that the story is basicly the same. Tom Arnold hates Christmas because his ex-wife cheated on him with his dentist on Christmas Eve. When he finally becomes enlightened by things he has no control over with the visits of Christmas spirits, it begins to sink into his head that he doesn't have it so bad. A reasonably decent romantic comedy for the holidays. Recommend you rent it first unless you are a huge Arnold fan."
2,Don't bother 'Chasing' THIS Christmas!,"Mediocre take on ""A Christmas Carol"" with Tom Arnold so why should anyone expect anything good. Had really hoped that Leslie Jordan might be fun as the 'Ghost of Christmas Past', but even he fell flat. Only fun part was seeing a c. 1968 living room on Christmas Eve!"
1,Lousy! Can't install on current Mac.,"Got this for my daughter and she can't even play it. Tried to install on our Mac and it would not install. Came to find out that it only works on PowerPC Macs which are dinosaurs. They haven't been made for over 10 years! Waste of money. Lousy lousy lousy! Can't return it because I opened it to install it. Very disappointed. Says it works on Mac which is technically true, but is very misleading. Really should not be listed as Mac compatible unless it states PowerPC only in big bold letters so people know it doesn't work on any Mac made in the past decade."
5,I'd give it 10 stars,My daughter practically begs to use this software. She is learning and totally loves getting the prizes after collecting the tickets. This was beyond a doubt one of the best purchases I've made. Not only is my daughter learning but she's having a blast! 10 stars **********
1,no tech support,"I would like to say my daughter loved this program. She sure wanted to play. But it seemed incompatible with my MAC, OS9, G3. I tried every route for their tech support, but ran into brick walls. Website offered only FAQs. Phone number was a recording, telling me to check the website or e-mail them. And my multiple e-mails went unanswered. I returned the product to the manufacturer for an exchange of books. Hope others have better luck."
5,Angela,"I'm very happy with the toy I purchased, I set it in my room and it looks so real. I love it."
3,so so a lot off old info,"same old same old but dont get tired of reading about the subject, they need new info on this subject"
3,Keep pecking away,This is an acceptable album. Some sassy and/or humerous songs. Danielle has an interesting drawl quality to her voice. A number of songs are just too slow or too forgettable. Better writing would help with a next album.
3,Shania Twang,"Ohio native Danielle Peck makes her debut on Big Machine Records, one of the independent labels associated with country superstar Toby Keith. The music here sounds like Shania Twain with the snare drums turned down and the twangy guitars cranked up. While Shania usually comes off as playful and flirty in her songs, Ms. Peck takes the ""I'm sexy but don't mess with me"" approach in her performances. Winners on this album include the brilliant first single ""I Don't"" (with great lyrics like ""The difference is Jesus loves you/But I don't""), the humorous follow-up ""Findin' A Good Man"", the tastefully sexy ""Kiss You On The Mouth"", and the kiss-off song ""Sucks To Be You"". Although some tunes like ""Honky Tonk Time"", ""Somebody Like You"" and ""Thirsty Again"" drift a little too much into the Shania Twain/Faith Hill camp, DANIELLE PECK is the work of a talented artist who deserves to be in the spotlight for many years to come."
4,"Young, Talented, Hot artist","Danielle has a refreshing delivery. She has incredible talent and her amazing looks don't hurt either. I think she will be a nice addition to the music industry with her direct-in your face lyrics delievered with a sensual playfulness. She is sharp, clever and knows how to sing the hooks that catch you the first listen. She also comes across as very transparent and at times incredibly vulnerable. She has many dynamics in her music and I feel she is just REAL. No strings, no pulled punches, just REAL. She sings of the relatable truths we have all been through and it is easy to relate and associate with where she is coming from. Simple yet effective with a little sas and a lot of sex appeal. I expect her to have a very successful music career. Artist like Danielle are rare and welcomed in today's industry."
4,This band swings HARD,"No question that Clark Terry assembled a terrific band back in 1974, when this was recorded, to take on tour throughtout the midwest. Jimmy Heath, Phil Woods, Richard Williams (tp), and Duke Jordan (p) are all first-rate musicians, and the band certainly knows how to wail. Arnie Lawrence (as) sounds like he's going to jump right out of his shoes during his solo on UNA MAS. RANDI is a pretty Phil Woods composition, on which Phil solos nicely. The ever-present MUMBLES is here (getting a bit stale after 10 years in the book). Best on the CD is TAKE THE A TRAIN, which contains excellent solos by Woods and Terry. The long 12-bar blues COLD TATER STOMP gets better in the second half after the somewhat uninspired trombone solo by Janice Robinson. All in all, a good performance at Wichita that April 21st."
3,For Beginners Only,"I can't make any complaints about the software itself... It worked fine. I was slightly disappointed because I felt that the method of teaching was overly tedious and I felt a bit ""baby-ed"" as I was going through some parts of the program. In general, it's a good Spanish program for beginners because it teaches a lot of basic vocabulary and grammar, but if you are at a more advanced level already, it would be a waste of money."
5,Simple book on beading,"One of my teenage kids makes beads and bracelets to sell at fairs, and as a hobby. Always looking for new ideas and found this book had some good ideas and good instruction. I recommend to buy a used copy in good condition like we did, save you the money."
2,ok,Not totally trilled with purchase but could be ok for beginners that want to start with simple projects that can be completed in a short period of time.
1,better band than book,"there's a band in portland called wet confetti, and if the band fought this book in an no-holds-barred grudgematch, i feel that the band would win.bands, i must say, are superior to books in every way. especially really rockin bands like wet confetti, who are also funnier and more attractive than this book."
1,Moeller 's tanks,"Recently purchased a 6 gallon Moeller tank. It came new, but with a hole in the bottom. Moeller apparently doesn't check their products before leaving the factory."
4,Makes a nice doggie den,"When our Large Petmate Vari Kennel first arrived, it was not packaged very well and the top had cracked in shipping. Thanks to Amazon's great return policy, we shipped it back and received a replacement in no time. Thankfully, the replacement was packaged better and was in perfect condition. This crate was super easy to put together and provides a nice, safe place for our puppy to sleep. The last crate we purchased, for a previous dog, was one of the wire ones. I debated on whether to go with another wire crate or the plastic. I'm glad we decided on the plastic one. It is quieter, it provides more privacy (for more of a ""den"" feel), less distractions (puppy can't see as much outside the crate), and if one were to need to fly their pet somewhere, the airlines will only accept this type of crate. I highly recommend this product. The only reason for the 4 stars vs. 5 was because of the problem with the first shipment."
1,no vents in the back,"The description says it is airline approved and the photo leads you to believe that the back has ventilation, however - the kennels I received do *not* have ventilation in the back and it is too close to my travel time to return this. Coupled with the fact that you have to buy a separate airline kit because it doesn't even come with dishes - also required by the airlines - well, I'm just not happy at all with this product. I shouldn't have to pay this much and then have to drill the vents in the back myself. This is deceptive. I'd give it a ""no star"" if I could."
4,Does what it is supposed to do...,"This kennel arrived within a few days which was great because my puppy had grown out of his small kennel. I thought the kennel was larger, so for the price it was actually higher than the pet store. My only complaint was that it didn't come with a food and water dish, which I thought came with ALL kennels. I had to go out and pay another $15.00 to get one. I would have returned the kennel but had to have a place for my puppy."
3,Fine for the dog.,"I wish it had a turn opener. The Vari Kennels always were the best but it is quite flexible on the top. Surprised me. Well, long ago we could safely sit on them. No more.The measurements were included the lip so it was smaller than I wanted."
4,Petmate Kennel,"Received the kennel in a very short time after placing the order...arrived in good condition. Easy to assemble and lightweight...our 6-month old Golden has plenty of room now and will be able to grow into it. Wanted one with a handle on the top, but since it weighs so little, one isn't really necessary. A good value for the money."
3,One had a cracked top. But shipped decent speed,The top of one had a crack in the plastic. I hope they will still let it on the plane..
5,Really great item!,"I purchased this kennel to replace an old, metal cage-like one that simply needed to be replaced. I have had it a few weeks and so far so good. I think my pup likes that it is more den-like than the old one. He is happier to cuddle up in here and be quiet, feeling less exposed. It is not a beautiful crate or anything, but it gets the job done. I just can't see spending hundreds of dollars on a wood/metal/wicker crate that he is going to eventually make gross just by being a dog. Besides, this is super easy to clean!"
1,They never sent it and didn't honor the price,"This is the most unprofessional company Companion Caterers.They had a sale on this product, there was one left, I paid for it. Then they come back a couple of days laterto say they don't have this one in stock. Liars. They do have this product in stock and if they sold the lastone at the price they offered, well when I bought mine at that price they should have honored it.I will never use this company again."
1,Disappointed With Product,We were very disappointed in the product. Less than a month later and our dog has broken the front door and seems beyond containment. We will have to look for something stronger and more reliable.
1,Never Again,We bought this for my 3 year old German Sheppard as a crate for when we had company over or needed to secure him when leaving him alone. I read several of the rather positive reviews before making the purchase. We were incredibly disappointed with the result. This crate is worthless. It took him less than 2 months to figure out how to escape. He forced the door to turn inwards bending the door and eventually broke the locking mechanism. Ironically our dog still loves to sleep in it. I had emailed the company looking for a fix but they never bothered to reply. Now we are out the money for the crate and are currently researching something of a higher quality of construction. This crate is utterly useless if you have a remotely smart or strong dog. I would strongly advise against wasting your money unless you have a very docile animal. Certainly don't expect any help from Petmate.
3,Vari Kennel Ultra,"I love the Petmate Kennels. We are hobby breeders and our dogs are trained to sleep in them at night. Overall the Vari Kennel Ultra gets a thumbs up. It's well built and a good value for the price. My one complaint is that they have a couple of bumps molded into the center of the bottom of the kennel. It is right in the area where the dog would sleep. When I received the first one, I thought perhaps it was a factory second. It almost looked like a molding for a handle which should not be on the bottom of the crate. I went to a neighborhood petmart where they had more of the kennels. Sure enough they had the same molding on the bottom center. The salesperson said that people just buy a cushion to cover it. That would be fine if I did not raise puppies. Till they are done teething they would probably eat a cushion a night! I called Petmate and mentioned it to them so I hope they took note of it. I think it saves them money to mold the top and bottom the same."
2,No rear vent on small Petmate Vari Kennel,"I purchased two of the small kennel for an upcoming transatlantic flight with my cats, and chose this model specifically because the product description claims that the kennel meets the IATA requirements and has rear ventilation. However, there is no rear ventilation on the small model and therefore it does not meet the IATA requirements, there has to be ventilation on all four sides. It's too much of a hassle to return such a large item, especially considering that the kennels were delivered in a broken box that I would not be able to use for a return, so I suppose I'll have to borrow a drill to make ventilation holes in the back of it in order to be able to use it for the intended purpose. The product description should be corrected."
4,Good product,"My 90 pound German Shepherd can break out of this kennel by banging on the door. However, that is easily fixed by either using bungee cords or turning the kennel to the wall so he sees there is no where to go. Took him about 2 weeks to get used to it. Very easy to put together and to take apart."
1,Crate isn't Great,"Easy to put together which also makes it a less than secure place for an active pet.If you want to try this crate, buy it...do not get it shipped to you. They sent me two crates that were both delivered damaged through error in packaging."
2,high priced for what it is,"My dog is an escape artist and will fight her way out of anything. I had to remove the screens from the sides because the chrome plating was peeling off and I was afraid she would ingest it. Had to cover the openings with plexiglass with slats cut into it to replace the screens, and placed a plexiglass cover over the front door screening to prevent her access to the metal. I would have returned it, but we needed a solution right now. Disappointed in the quality considering the price for a plastic box."
4,Why is it cheaper?,I have to say this thing is pretty nice for the price. I bought another crate from a different brand that was 20 bucks more and this one has a bigger opening for my dog and a couple more inches in length and its perfect for him. Ive since taken the old one and out that in the car and this one stay in the house. Assembly is pretty easy and its seems well built.
4,Easy to assemble,"This crate is easy to assemble and durable. We had a medium for our chocolate lab as a 7 week old puppy, however, by 3 months it was too cramped and uncomfortable for him. This one is airline approved and very roomy for him. At 4 months he is 45-50 lbs and he can still grow into this one."
4,"Nice pet crate purchased from Amazon, but a weak carrying handle","I received the pet crate promptly. It assembled quickly and easily. It has a nice metal gate at the front, which appears sturdy plus provides air venting for your pet. My only complaint is the carrying handle. It is of cheaper plastic, and comes out of the slots easily. For instance, if you have a heavy pet, and you pick up the crate at an angle (not straight up and down), the handle may come off. The handle is not hard to put back into the two slots, but you might drop your pet if you aren't careful. They should work on improving the handle."
3,"Dog loves it, doesn't work for most airlines","I bought this kennel because it said it was TSA approved. However, most airlines require that your kennel use nut and bolt screws to secure the top half and bottom half. This kennel comes with plastic fasteners not metal screws so I cannot use it to fly on Delta or Alaska Airlines to name a few. My puppy however loves it, I bought the intermediate size for my labrador. I went back and forth between this and a cage like kennel however this is more enclosed which I think dogs like."
2,Not for the escape artist,"It's nice and pretty crate, but not for smart and strong dog - it took my dog one day to figure out how to pinch down the lock and got herself out the crate, after that I put extra lock to block the existing lock, she got mad at and chew throw the crate to get herself out. Now the new crate is in garbage, waiting for throw away. If your dog is extrem smart and strong, that's not crate for you. Otherwise, I will say it's good crate."
4,"""Go Green! Go White!""",This is a very nicely done Michigan State Long-Sleeved T-shirt. Not made with too heavy of material if that is what your looking for. Can easly be worn as an undershirt as well without getting too hot as well by itself.
2,texture is dense and unappetizing,"i normally enjoy granola bars or trail mix bars, but thought i'd try something new..... big mistake. these bars have a dense, unappetizing texture that seems extremely processed. they contain isolated soy proteun, which is not healthy and a lot of sugar. the topping is horribly sweet."
1,Does not work very well,"This tape does not work very well! I had a hard time getting it to melt unless I was willing to hold the iron on so long that it burned the fabric. I am going to throw it out and go to Ikea and buy some of their curtain hemming tape, which works MUCH better than this!"
3,Ok if you do not want to deal with sewing machine.,"If you want to hem (shorten) your pants but do not have a sewing machine, this would be an option but not a long-term solution. I bought because I have few pants which are a bit too long for formal occasion, and I have no experience with sewing. It does not stay on certain material that well as others, but I did manage to use this on all three pants in slightly different fabric, and it stays after wearing them walking all day long for few times without washing. However, after first wash, some of them fell apart. I would not recommend this on something you wear daily and wash frequently, but I found it useful for me to do a quick and easy hemming on something I occasionally wear."
3,works,item works & wasn't hard to install it. It has to be ironed to get it to hold. Also holds after being washed.
1,Holds little,"I used this to hem a pairs of women's cotton dress pants. It held on half of one side through one wash. When I redid it, it fell out as I was wearing them that day."
3,"Works, but instructions are useless","The thing does work. I mean, we just got it to melt and we are assuming it will hold a pants hem decently. However, instructions did not work at all with a pair of khakis. We had to put double strips and use a piece of paper instead of a cloth to iron on top of in order to let enough heat to pass. Oh, 10 seconds? We needed to rounds of 30 seconds to get one set of stripes molten enough."
3,Too many average songs....,"There were too many songs on this that i would consider average, at best. Ordinarily I wouldn't mind, BUT they do this at the expense of giving us the full length versions of the classics. Zoom, Just to be close to you, Three times a lady, etc.... are all the 45 (remember those) version, and NOT what is on the original albums. I would have rather heard those longer renditions, and skipped the marginal tunes."
2,They chopped the endings of the Anthology --Commodores. Not a good thing to do.,"They chopped the endings of the songs in the Anthology: The Best of the Commodores.Not a good thing to do. A lot of the endings of the song/music, were some of the best parts.It's best to buy the original (Album/CD)'s to get the best effects of the music.That's just my opinion."
2,Commodores CD could have been better,"For anyone who is a genuine lover and fan of the Commodores, this CD would be a great asset, however, too many tracks on one disc is too hard to believe and as it goes, this equals some of the tracks being shortened or edited to the single versions instead of the full-length versions due to the amount of tracks and time. This always happens. The songs you love the most are single edits. Therfore, this CD becomes a waste to buy because you would rather have songs like these at their fullest to enjoy better. It's really to bad no one has put out The Commodores in a box set of three to four discs. It would cost a lot but all the songs for Commodores lovers would be the long versions."
2,not whats displayed,"pop gun not what adveratized...not a long nose,and a completely different pop gun.the one i got is made of steel construction and not of light weight aluminum.."
5,Sid the Science Kid - Sense-Ational Adventures,"I would give this more stars but I can only give 5, my 4 year old grandson loves Sid and honestly so do I! It is so cute and makes learning fun for the kids! I absolutely recommend this DVD."
2,Just say no!,"I picked this up at Circuit City the other day, and I was so disappointed that I took it back the next day. Sure, it covers the phone, and it's leather. Those are the solitary high points. As for the cons, the fit was amazingly sloppy. The seams are external, so they take an otherwise small, slick phone and turn it into an oversized monster. The cutouts for camera, power, etc. are approximations at best. The screen protector is nothing to write home about, and the case does not seem to stay on well. The point is, go get the Body Glove case. It really does fit the 8100 perfectly and you will be much happier. Unless you're _really_ into leather and huge cell phones."
4,Rick,I have one for myself. The only draw back is my lock broke and I have been unable to fix anyone that can fix it. Besides that I really like the knife thats why I bought another one for my son.
5,very nice,"purchased this knife for my brother in law for christmas, he does a lot of hunting. he really liked it, camo print looks very good and knife has that auto push button flip out blade thing that most guys like. good buy and great price"
2,Not realistic;overly dramatic,"I was disappointed--the characters were whiney and overdramatic, and all but one of the kids were horrid brats! Yeeks!Couldn;t find anyone to like except Cora. Better luck next time!"
3,Adoption stories!,"It's an interesting story.....adults searching for their biological parents. But, some of the angst was a little hard to buy.....why did it have such a negative impact on their spouses/marriages?! But, still an enjoyable read."
2,Just not great...,"This was certainly a fast read. In general, I enjoyed it - this topic of adoption was interesting, but it wasn't really what I expected. I think I was hoping it would be a bit more like a Jodi Picoult book and it wasn't. The characters, I think, were what was lacking - they weren't entirely flushed out and the P.O.V.s, particularly of the children were weak. The writing was a little weak too - but that was probably more to do with the fact that I have been reading so much Anne Rice lately and this author's writing was just so... English. Usually, I enjoy English voices, but, I don't know, overall this book seemed average at best. I would probably not have purchased other books of hers, but I got a few at the dollar racks all at the same time...Mostly I am at a loss as to what read next, but I suppose something will work its way into being interesting."
3,Well researched,"Joanna Trollope's new book deals with a subject of which I've had some experience. I'm a birth mother who's daughter found me 10 years ago. Having read five or six of Trollope's novels, I was interested to see how she would handle this topic. She's done the research. The adoption triad is complex and Trollope recognizes this. Cora and Carole's reactions to being found and meeting their children rang true for me.The story lost power when it shifted back and forth to Steve's office staff. These people weren't interesting and were an annoying distraction from the main topic.Those readers who have an interest in, or are involved in, the adoption triad may find this a good read. It's not hard to relate to each member's postion. Trollope has succeeded in showing adoption and the adoption reunion in a realistic way."
4,A Bit Different,"When you upset the delicacy of a family, you never know what the outcome will be so when Nathalie and David agree to search for their birth mothers, the applecart turns upside down and we watch the apples tumble out. Everyone is affected by this decision. Their adoptive mother has serious concerns over her role in their life once they've met the women who gave birth to them. Their spouses have to sort through where they fit in the overall picture. The birth mothers have to face their past and decide how or if it will fit in with their present. Even the children of the two siblings feel the changes around them and react in their own way. Trollope tells a good story. Perhaps there are some issues that seem to be a little thin. I would have liked to know a bit more about the after affects to Cora and Carole, the two birth mothers. But overall, it's an interesting storyline and has some merit to it."
2,"Great music, shame about the CD quality","The music of the International Sweethearts of Rhythm is quite hard to find on CD, with only a handful of their tracks previously available scattered on various compilations. However, my joy over finally having a whole CD of their recordings turned to disappointment when I listened to it, to find that the tracks seem to have had some kind of heavy audio compression applied to them. Either someone processed the tracks trying to eliminate the noise and inadvertently eliminated half the music, or this CD is a questionable burn of second-hand low-quality MP3s. This is telephone-quality stuff. But i guess on the bright side, at least it's now available.The recordings are of mid 40s Jubilee Radio Show Broadcasts, and include introductions by Ernie ""Bubbles"" Whitman"
4,Great Music If You Can Overlook A Few Flaws!,"I've been waiting for a CD featuring music by my favorite band The International Sweethearts of Rhythm and I can overlook the quality a little. The sound quality could be clearer and louder but its still listenable. Hopefully, a better CD can come out and more music of the Sweethearts added. I don't know if this CD was made in the USA or not but if it was it would have had better quality and in the liner notes there should had been more photos and info on the band and what became of them and when they died. I think anyone who wants to buy this CD, who isn't particular or picky, will enjoy it because the music is still enjoyable!"
2,Just doesn't measure up to rest of Clancy catalogue,"I don't know if it's because Tommy Makem wasn't around for this album (he had long since been replaced by Robbie O'Connell) or that the guys were just feeling their years. Whatever the reason, this doesn't have the energy or passion of the Clancys greatest albums. There are a few memorable performances (John O' Dreams, in particular), but in general the quartet sounds like an Irish nostalgia act."
3,"keep the book, throw out the rest","Mr. Sidaway is one of my favorite watercolorist. His work is a real joy and inspiration. The little instruction book is a keeper, the rest of the materials are of very pour quality. Pick it up used and its a good buy."
1,"Save Money, Buy a Fossil Watch","I am a fan of Burberry, but I would not recommend buying their watches. I bought a similar Burberry watch as a gift for my mother. The case and band have begun to corrode/rust. Burberry has refused to help citing that warranty does not cover the case and band. They have directed me to contact Fossil for repairs, who is the manufacturer of the watch. Its disappointing to see a cheap watch is being sold by slapping a luxury label at a premium store."
2,Hamlet Audio CD,This wasn't as good as I was hoping. I needed more background sound effects--not just people with British accents.
4,"A great Cd, but...","This Cd is really another Fusion classic and it ranks up to the first 11th House album - only this time it's played live with MUCH power. All members are on the very top, Mike Lawrence doing a great job, Larry Coryell plays great and with lots of powe, he especially sounds great on ""11th House Blues"" where he shows his great blues feeling. Alphonse fast and with lots of power , but he never overplays - incredible playing.A great album overall,but unfortunatelly the running time is quite short...anyway, get it!"
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed the book -- particularly for its true-to-form coverage of the trial process.However, the subplots garble up the middle of the book, which made it difficult for me to continue reading. In the end, I'm glad I didn't give up, but I found it to be a frustrating read at times."
5,This software is really great!,"I bought this software (not reading the label well) for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She was too young for it and I did not show it to her then. By the time she was 2 1/2 yrs I installed it on her computer and she immediately got attached to it. She plays at the lowest level, and needs my help to get the correct sequence of events (the longest sequence is Clifford's getting a bath) and of course she cant do it herself yet. But believe it or not, putting the puzzle together, sorting the groceries, getting the correct associations (by digging the ground at the b'day site), rescuing the little dog from the ocean, decorating the cake, bathing Clifford, playing soccer.... she just loves doing those by herself and can spend hours doing so. She is few months short of 3yrs now and still is enamoured by this CD."
3,Does not play on MAC OS X Leopard,"Unfortunately this game is not compatible with the OS X Leopard version (I have not found a way to make it run). I had some trouble figuring out why one game I had purchased ran without problems, the Thinking Adventures though simply did not. It seems to be the age of the game: one is from 2000, whereas the working one is from 2001. Of course the Clifford games are absolutely wonderful for children (my 4-year old is fascinated by them and I am too), but this one is not compatible with my computer so I can't give it 5 stars. It would have been nice to know this beforehand, but I did not see this information advertised anywhere when I placed it in my shopping cart. It says Mac OS X Classic (whatever that may mean), whereas the game which works advertises with running on Mac OS X without an additional word ""classic."""
2,There are BETTER clifford games,"My 5-year-old son had this game and the Clifford Learning Activities. The Learning Adventures is a very limited game. My son went right through it and was bored after he had completed it. He occasionally wanted to play it after he had finished it but it just could not hold his attention like a good educational game. We got the Clifford Learning Activities and were VERY pleased with this game. It is constantly challenging him and holds his interest. There are tons more educational areas than the birthday game. As a parent, it contains more of the items I would like my son to learn and he too is thrilled with the other game. If you are looking for a game for the long haul AVOID THE LEARNING ADVENTURES and get the ACTIVITIES."
5,Surprised and very pleased.,"This is my very first childs software game. I was quite amazed with it. Our 4 yr had never touched a mouse before, yet she (faked) a cry when she had to stop playing after her first 40 minutes. She needed only occasional help learning the game and of course it's even more fun if your nearby to share her excitment at the many surprises presented."
2,Not- too-great thinking adventure,"I recently gave this game to my five year old and am very dissappointed in it. It does not give any verbal instructions that she can understand, so I have had to try to figure out what she is supposed to do, mainly by deciphering the manual. Once we figure out what to do, she seems to get very bored very quickly. Even though the age range says 4-6, I don't see many 5 or 6 year olds being challenged by this game."
3,Universally helpful--no matter your specialty/school,"A quick and conscise way to get a handle on residency ranking, as well as a introduction to organizing your priorities in choosing your Match-list. I found this book personalized the daunting task of choosing a specialty, and ranking my programs. As a FMG, I also found its insight towards the compendiums of FMG friendly hospitals to be invaluable."
1,Disappointing Sheet Set,"I was very disappointed with this sheet set and will be returning it. For a Laura Ashley product I expected much better quality. The pillow cases had major flaws and the fabric was rather thin----it seemed much lighter than 5 oz.They don't compare to the 5 oz. sheets I've bought from Land's End or The Company Store. Even for the $20 price, I didn't think they were worth keeping."
5,The only one that works always,"I've tried more partition tools than I can count including Partition Magic but none works like Partition Commander. It does exactly what is says it will do, nothing more, nothing less. When I'm doing somthing as dangerous as re-partitioning, I need a tools I can trust and Partition Commander is it.Doug Fenwick, Technical Manager, Cubic Appl, Inc"
3,Mixed blessing at best,"I find it ok for all partitonoing tasks and resizing. It took me some time to read it thoroughly before proceeding carefully with the tasks. Not rich in graphics unlike Partition Magic, you had to be extremely careful with what you do. Delete the wrong partiton and there's no way to retrieve it back. So I reread the instructions over but was able to execute it successfully. The BIG downside is when trying to do multiple operating system as it claims to do but it fails miserably. Forget it! All it did was overide the main OS and I had to retrieve it back with Norton Ghost.The main thing to remember is its limitations. Use this program ONLY for partitoning and resizing hard drive. It's a good price compared with Part. magic (double the cost). But when you want to add new OS, the choice is Partiton Magic."
4,"Probably not as great as Partition Magic 6, but it's cheaper","This works just fine for me. The price was a contributing factor for me to purchase this product. I haven't used Partition Magic, but the general response I have read seems to be greater than Partition Commander. Unfortunately, I paid half the price for Partition Commander versus for what I would have paid for Partition Magic. It offers GUI feature, but must be installed under Windows first and run through DOS second. You have to read the manual in order to master the features it offers for disk partition. It has a wizard to help you out, but I would advice people to master manual partition since the wizard does funky partition ratios that it sees fit to optimize your drive. Not a terribly bad problem, but I rather have control over what and where I want my partition."
1,Still trying to recover,"I'm running Win ME and have a C and a D hard drive. I did back up the C drive because it has most all of the OS stuff and it was the only drive I wanted to partation. I tryed installing the software three time within Windows and it stopped at the point of retriving the system files. So I rebotted to DOS with the reboot disk I made and tried to just partation the C drive. It took all my files on the C drive and made one partation of which I couldn't get into, I could copy it to a free space on another drive so I picked D drive. I then had a partation on C drive that I couldn't get into and a copy on the D drive of the C partation of which I still couldn't get into and all the file on the D drive were now in their own partation of which I couldn't get into. I had to reformat both drives and restore the C drive from the backup and I'm still trying to restore what I had on the D drive"
1,Pure trash,"Where to start with this movie-well the plot is about two (or three) basketball players in thier final year of high school. One is the star player that is involved with a drug dealer (not established until an hour into the movie) and the other is the bench warmer that lives with his brother.The star player skips practices to lookover his drug dealing ant the bench warmer gets a chance to start.That's when the movie falls apart. Instead of focusing on those two it drifts off. We find out all three (the third guy is just there) to Michigan State, another character is on the team because of his father, we see two kids dealing and there is a 5 minute segway to Miami after the star player steals from the drug lord. We even get a brief hint that the two might be related.The movie ends with a to be continued. Lets hope not."
1,Big Shot,"I wonder if the writer in the prior review is a relative of Meadows???? I find the statement that someone was ""robbed"" a very negative statement about the person who was robbed. Why bring down the winner? I didn't care for Meadows because he always acted like he was a ""Big Shot"". He came across as ungenuine, egotisical and very hot on himself. The best thing about his CD is that one doesn't have to see him and see those characteristics come across. His character doesn't seem to fit with most of the artists in country music."
5,Lego candy party favors,I purchased the Lego candy for my 6 year old son's birthday party favors. I put the candy in a little take-out chinese style container and added 2 Lego minifig keychains to the top. The favors were a hugh hit!
4,Great Candy,"These candies are fresh and delicious. the only problem i had with these and the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was the colors, 80% of the candy was yellow the rest was a mix of red, green and blue. there was no purple, I'm not sure if i was just unlucky or what. Its still a great tasting product and fun for kids to build with"
3,Nice introduction to techniques to use in different terrains,"The set contains 3 DVDs. Each DVD focuses on 2 major areas and there are 5-6 tips for each area, with demo movie and step by step explanation for each tip.It gives a nice but brief introduction to techniques for use in different terrains. I think it is best suited for intermediate skiers who starts to ski off piste. They are the ones who will benefit most from the tips."
2,"Purchase of book, 1981 edition","The book I purchased is a 1981 edition, now out of print. I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the book. It was advertised as being in ""very good"" condition with only a tear in the jacket.The book arrived very dirty with a very worn jacket, stains on the cover, etc. I requested a replacement at my expense for shipping, but that was denied. I was offered a 20% discount on another book, but declined.I have been able to clean the cover and outer edges of the pages somewhat and the book is in very ""readable"" condition. The price, $12.00, was very reasonable.I will continue to purchase books, new and used, from Amazon."
4,Great Stretch & Workout!,"This is perfect for the pilates person who wants to diversify their workout. My only qualm was that to do some of the more advanced workouts you need 2 foam rollers. Otherwise, it's a great workout and stretch!"
2,Don't advertise speakers if it's only one speaker!!!,"I took extra care to read the description and everywhere it talked about the product it said speakers - with an 's' as in plural. Well, they only send one. I am returning the product on account of false advertising. I had them waive the 5% restocking fee because it's their fault not mine. I'm sure it's a fine product, but I'm tired of being lied to by companies who can't seem to do their ad accurately."
5,"a comprehensive, easy-to-read guide","A very helpful, well-written guide that includes a detailed description of the disease, treatments, and coping strategies for everyday life, as well as an extensive glossary and bibliography."
2,Too narrow-minded in its approach,"This book provides excellent information about what rheumatoid arthritis is, how to distinguish it from osteoarthritis, etc.However, it really is a book about ""living with"" an autoimmune disease. Much more helpful are books that empower a person with the knowledge needed to take responsibility for improving their health ... with the aim of RECOVERY!In contrast, the book ""Conquering Arthritis"" by Barbara Allan, is the well-researched account of someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover from the disease, to regain their quality of life. And succeeded! And, as far as healthful diet is concerned, a book like Dr Joel Furhman's ""Eat to Live"". That type of book is well worth spending your money on!"
3,decent book.,"the haynes book has 10 times as many diagrams, but the information in this book is worth the four dollars spent on a used copy."
5,Great knife.,"I carry this knife daily. It holds its edge, works well, and stays clipped to my pants. The safety works nice and makes me feel comfortable carrying it knowing it won't open itself. Occasionally I run it through the dishwasher to clean lint and dust. Then I put a dab of oil on the hinge to keep it lubricated and working like it should."
4,Nice Watch,"I like my new watch, the face is smaller than I would have liked, but it is a very nice watch all the same. It came quickly, and in great shape. Thank you."
5,One of the rarier Motown CDs ever,"This superb 1963 Marvelettes album was issued on CD in 1994 and boy, before you say ""bam"", it was deleted. The original 10 track album was quite a good period album, but, holy mackerel, ""Knock On My Door"", a 1964 unused singles track is just plain amazing.Some background; the last 3 Marvelettes singles had not sold too well, and when they recorded ""Knock On My Door"" as a possible single, it did not make the grade. Instead, their ""Too Many Fish In The Sea"" was released a few months later, and became quite a big hit, although it should've been bigger. It's generally considered one of the best Motown singles of that middle-period.This CD is usually going for big bucks these days...I'm sure happy I got my copy."
4,gift,This was a book that my school needed for school. He did enjoy reading it and talks about how good it was.
5,Well written,"This book was very well written by John Milton. This wonderful book puts a whole new perspective on creation,the fall of man,and the rebellion of Satan."
5,Great reading,I bought the Kindle edition for a recent vacation trip to the beach. I found it to very interesting and easy to read on the kindle. Learned about this book on another trip to Charleston and couldn't wait to read it!
4,Mrs. Whaley's Garden does not disappoint!,"Having recently had the opportunity to tour Mrs. Whaley's real Charleston garden, I was most interested to read her book about the creation of the garden itself. The book was delightful. It made me wish I had had an opportunity to meet her and talk with her. She was apparently a spunky, confident Southern lady who was never intimidated by anyone! The book talks about the creation of her garden, which amazingly still looks much like what she describes in her book. But the book is more than the description of her garden--it also relates details about her life in Charleston and about her philosophy of life as well. This is a book well worth reading. It is one I will keep and read again."
1,Buy something else,"Worked great for 30 days - just long enough to not be exchanged, then the High Def output stopped working. The other features still work, but I bought it to be used with HDMI, and that output is totally dead. Will have to send to a service place for repair."
5,dvd vr345,Had this machine for at least 4 years. Use it for transfering from dv tapes on camera to dvd. Always functioned properly. Never failed. Not even a call for support. Found it to be an excellent machine. Would recommand it if it's still available
1,Not recommended,"Had this unit for about 8 months before I finally decided to throw it away. Reason? Exceedingly sensitive, or possibly misaligned, read head. It frequently pixelated, stopped, or simply would not play pre-recorded commercial DVDs, especially toward the end of the recording (where, I presume, we are on the inside of the disk, at the lowest linear speed). After arduous, often repeated, cleaning of the disk, sometimes I could get it to play. After replacing the unit with a simple DVD player, by Panasonic, this problem disappeared.This problem with the Samsung worsened over time, and was not due to any abuse of the unit. Nothing like this has happened to the Panasonic, so I have to presume that the manufacturing quality control of Samsung is simply not up to snuff. I am now hesitant to buy any of their video products."
3,Good Machine; Poor Manual,The device works reasonably well once the instructions have been mastered.
2,not what I expected,"The net will probably last a long time and serve it's purpose, but I was expecting a red white and blue net as pictured when I ordered. I recieved a white one which I could have purchase cheaper elsewhere. It was also shipped from KleinSports instead of AthleticStuff (which is where I ordered it from). Emailed to get the red/white/blue one and they said it was a mistake and didn't come in that color, only white. Too bad, so sad. No option other than to return it, or keep at higher price."
