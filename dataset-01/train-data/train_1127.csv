5,Awesome Gloves!,I have several different styles of Mechanix Wear gloves but the originals are the best suited for everyday general use and the red looks good too! Stylish and Functional...what more to ask for??
3,Mechanix Glove,"Price was good. With this being my first pair of mechanix gloves, I thought they would last longer than they did, already have a hole. Will look around for better made gloves."
5,Great glove!,"Fit perfect, i use it to work on my truck, and it gives freedom to do everything. It is a soft glove."
2,so -so,"Gloves are comfortable, and fit well, but their durability is horrible. If its a work glove, one would expect them to be able to hold up to ""work"". fingers wear out and split after approx 10 uses."
4,good gloves.good price.not for heavy duty work.,these are excellent gloves.i normally opt for a rubber gripped glove but decided to try these out.gloves normally last me 4 or so months a pair and these lasted me 2 months.they are slightly cheaper than what i normally get.i used them for use at a moving company.after two months finger tips are getting split apart.would buy again for different purpose.
5,The one and only.,"When somebody says, ""fits like a glove"", they can scarcely imagine these - make sure you get the sizing right."
3,Season 5... the low point of the series.,"Season 5 was good but not as hillarious as seasons 1-2-3-4. There were good episodes in Season 5 but I consider them mediocre compare to last 4 seasons.Season 5 Episodes that can be skipped* The following episodes are pointless fillers...Ep 10 - ""A Leotard is a Girl's Burden""Ep 11 - ""The Mixed-Bath Horror!""Ep 13 - ""Revenge! Raging Okonomiyaki!""Ep 15 - ""Shogi Showdown""Ep 23 - ""Case of the Missing Takoyaki!"""
2,"Shoddy workmanship, coarse fabric, poor fit","I bought these same shirts about ten years ago and liked them. Ordered two shirts this time and they have changed for the worst. The fabric is not smooth, but almost denim like and coarse. The fabric wrinkles easily while being worn. The cut is far too large, even though the size is the same as my originals. One of the shirts has a sleeve that was not sewn correctly, leaving a hole between the sleeve & the body of the shirt....it is not wearable without repair. The shirt should not have made it through even a cursory inspection process. I am contacting the Dickies company, requesting a replacement shirt at their cost. Would not buy this shirt again."
2,Rough and shows sweat,"This is a tough shirt, but a bit of a nipple-chafer if you work hard for a living. It also changes color drastically when wet, and pools sweat in the pocket stitching to make weird patterns. Not really a ""work"" shirt unless your work is paperwork. :) Sizes do run large. I wear an XL shirt normally, but this XL is now the largest shirt I own. :)"
5,Good value!,"I bought 2 of these for myself and couldn't be happier. They don't look like a stereo typical work shirt. Unlike another reviewer, I did not have a problem with the size.I'm going to buy more of these."
1,Volcanology NOT religion.,Honestly this dvd sucked. I'm obsessed with volcanoes and have seen much better. It has ubsurd religious overtones which has nothing to do with geology or volcanology whatsoever. Not much science to this one. Just fairytale nonsense. Keep your religion out of our volcanology & scientific facts please.
2,Redundant and slow...,"I was looking for DVDs on the Mt.St.Helens eruption to show my kids, so I ordered this one. I teach in a Christian school and this production does have some religious themes, but the presentation, pacing and narration are all smack in the made-at-home-video zone. The documentary footage was all gleaned from the public domain stuff that we've all seen many times."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"After visiting Mt. St. Helens, my wife and I became fascinated with the story surrounding the 1980 eruption. We both read an excellent book by Frank Parchman on the subject, and were looking for video of the events. While there was some excellent footage and first person accounts in the video, I was expecting much more. At least 15 minutes of footage (out of a total of around 45 minutes) was babbling brooks and vague background information. Also, it spent an inordinate amount of time on events after the original eruption. The people they interviewed seemed only to be peripherally involved in the event, including the geologist who gave an interesting, if a little lackluster, interview. The video definitely needed more footage of the immediate events. Given these problems, plus the amateurish production values, its hard to justify the $20 price tag."
2,not so good,the part where you plug into the car lighter broke as soon as i used it.i just didnt want to bother sending it back.
2,Doesn't last,"Bought one, lasted about a year. Bought another, died a year later. Tire has slow leak so it was used to top up (5 minutes) tire about once a or twice a month."
1,Bad product,"Got this product a month ago, today first time needed to use it. Light comes on but the compressor did not work. Tried to return the product to amazon but unfortunately return product window has expired. I guess you get what you pay for it. If you still opt for this product make sure to test it upon arrival if not happy or non-functional return the product immediately."
5,Slime COMP03 12 Volt Tire Inflater with gauge and light,"The tire inflator is exactly what I was lloking for. Fairly compact and easily fits in the trunk spare tire well of my vehicle. Nice having the light if I ever need it for night time use. Hope I never have to use it. Great little product. The gauge appears to be a couple of lbs of pressure off from my other tire gauges, but certainly not enough to worry about."
1,Piece of Junk at any price,"Woke up and saw my tire was flat....almost on the rim...went to another low cost store(Sorry amazon) to get an inflater.well to make a long story short it took longer then 12 mins to pump up one tire to 32 PSI when the tire needed 45 PSI and it started smoking,made a poping sound and started loosing air from the tire through the compressor...I lost the recipt so this went in the trash after 1 tire....NOT a good deal!!"
1,Broke within 30 seconds of first use,"I'm surprised how these companies can make such a piece of garbage and put it on the shelves. After taking this out of the box and plugging it in to the 12V outlet, the compressor didn't turn on at all. After messing with it, it started to work but promptly began to smoke heavily and shake around. When unplugging it from the outlet, the part to plug in was so hot it burned my hand. Never will I buy another Slime product."
1,Not a good compressor,"I bought this compressor because of the Slime name, which I expected to provide a quality product. This compressor is weak. It only pumps up to 30psi before it stops pumping (not 300psi). I still have to finish off my bicycle tires with a hand pump.15 years ago I bought a $20 compressor and it lasted until last year. Last year I bought a super-cheap $8 compressor. It lasted a few months. I thought by spending a little more I would get more, but I don't expect this one to last very long either. It is just a cheap piece of junk with a name-brand that people trust so that you are fooled into buying it. What a waste of money!"
1,"I Got ""Slimed"" By This Purchase!","I bought this as a replacement for a compressor I had for many years. I used it maybe 4 times and the clamp interior was chipping off already. Therefore, it wouldn't inflate the tire because it couldn't clamp down tightly. I only had it for about 4 months before this happened. Now I have to buy a new one - I'm definitely getting a different brand. I certainly got ""Slimed"" by buying this cheap piece of junk. If possible, I would give this zero stars. Save your money!"
2,meh,"extremely cheap feeling. the gauge was not accurate and was not fully attached to the inside of the case. its quite loud and vibrates violently. light is not very bright. it does, however, inflate tires. its a little slow, but it works. i used mine for about 2 weeks and returned it. just didnt seem like it was worth the money."
2,Slimey all right.,Had it for about 8 months and I only used it three times. The third time was the charm %&*#@#*&! and it never worked since. Invest your money in a better quality model or another brand.
1,This is not worth buying even at this low cost,"This is a very low quality device. The part that connects the end of the hose to the valve stem of the tire has a plastic neck that breaks off very easily. Getting the hose to connect properly to the valve stem is also a problem since there is a rubber gasket inside the connector that grabs the threads of the valve stem and seems to get in the way. This also makes it very difficult to remove the connector from the valve stem and hence the ""breaks off easily"" statement above.This is really not worth the money since when you need it to work, you really need it to work. Spend just a little more money and get a better made unit. This was really a waste of money."
1,Not for inflating vehicle tires,"I bought 2 of these. I tried using one, it takes forever to inflate a tire...I had it running for 10 minutes. It barely inflated the flat tire. The instruction said do not use continuously for more than 10 minutes and wait 30 minutes before using it again. It will take hours to inflate a totally flat tire. I returned both of them.One more good reason to buy from Amazon...""returns"""
1,Nice pump....,"I like the fact that it has a long chord so it can be plugged into the lighter and has a long reach. Works fine. Great to have in an emergency kit.UPDATE!This item is JUNK!!!! I used exactly 2 times and it died. The 2nd time I was using it, it started smoking and the seized up. That was it. I wish i could give it ZERO stars!!!!"
2,Just a NO!,"It's very weak, it doesn't have much power to it! Very disappointed and wish I hadn't bought it!!!!! 2 stars (Only because it got here quickly)"
2,Tire inflator,it is very slow to fill a tire. the attachment piece to the tire is made of plastic and not very durable. it is much smaller than others so that is a plus for me cause i carry it in my car.
1,do not buy,"try another one, this stopped working after using 3-4 times.also it don;t have auto system.and measuring is analog. try digital one."
1,DOA,I bought this to replace my last pump that had finally died after 5+ years. The price was right... or so I thought. I made the mistake of not testing it when it arrived. I came up with a slack tire and found out the hard way that the pump was DOA. Brand new out of the box would not power on.
2,Too noisy,Takes a while to inflate a tire but can wake up entire neighborhood especially if you need to use it beside daytime.
1,Too Noisy!!,"It's way Too Noisy!!!It makes a 86 dbl noise, which means it WILL damage your hearing!!This is the only bad thing about this pump! Otherwise it's GREAT!"
4,I'll keep it but...,"I used the compressor to add air to 4 tires, approx. 5-7 psi per tire and it worked fine, didn't take too long. However, there are 2 problems with the device - 1. After adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem, after 4 tires it was very ripped up. 2. The compressor vibrates so much that you can't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over. I guess that's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor. While the rubber seal is a concern, it's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work. I only hope the seal doesn't get so bad that the nozzle won't keep a good connection with the valve stem."
1,What A Piece Of Junk!,I may have used this thing 2 to 3 times at best since I bought it back in May 2008 and the inside of the seal has already ripped up so that I cannot even get it to attach to the tire valve. Can I say 'Rip Off'? Look elsewhere and pass this one up!
5,Great product for the price!,"What can you say, every car should have one. I ordered two, one for my car and one for my wife's. Works great, no problems with it at all so far. The gauge on it lets me use it just to keep my tires properly inflated between rotations. Great to have in case of an emergency."
1,bad,"The team arrived defective, the light does not light, I am not satisfied at all, the compressor works well, too bad.thanksEnder"
2,"Good, but poor quality","I had this air pump for about a year now. I had use it about 5 time since then. The unit is now useless... it will not air up my tires anymore. It will start, then make all the pump noise like it use to, but no increase in tire pressure. I had to use my old beatup walmart $10 12v air pump to finish it off. I had that pump for about 10yrs now, and it's still working today. The only reason why I bought this slime air compressor, because it had a pressure guage and light. If not for these features I would not have bought this crap. My mistake was assuming that this would last as long as my old compressor.. wrong! Do not waste your money on this junk. Not very reliable."
4,Great deal on air pump,"After looking at this pump in stores I found it for less at Amazon. It works really well and is great if you need to air up your tire in an emergency. The light works great, too."
5,Great little emergency & non-emergency compressor,"I got this Slime compressor because of the company and a working knowledge of their other products. My intention was to give it to my daughter for emergencies, but also to use around the house. The tires on my riding mower and my little Cub Cadet tractor are always needing air, it seems.Having this little compressor sure beats the heck out of jacking up the unit, removing the wheel and tire & then taking it down to the gas station for air. I've even paid 50 for the privilege. In two to three minutes, I'm back in the yard cutting the grass. Adding a half hour to the lawn without this little compressor puts me in a grouchy mood.Since it has a built in flashlight makes me feel better when my daughter is traveling the two hours back and forth to college, just in case she needs illumination.I would recommend everyone has a COM-03 in their trunk. As Slime used to say in their advertising, ""Because Flats Suck!""."
2,"Handy compact design, but poor quality.","Pros: Handy and compact design: cable and pump fit into a compartment, the light is handy.Cons:- Pump was dead on arrival, the overall quality is quite poor and flimsy.- No adapter for bike valveI am returning this for a different pump."
1,Loud Noise! Takes long time to inflate!,"Once I purchased this compressor I thought that it would do the job. It makes a loud noise that even my neighbors noticed that. Secondly, it takes a long time to inflate the tire. Hopefully you don't make the same mistake that I made."
4,Good inexpensive emergency compressor,Bought this for my wife's car and I have only used it to air up a tire. Everything seems to work with no problems. It is cheaply made with thin plastic but that's what I expected.
5,When Stillness Is Your Path,"I am buying this book today after reading a copy from the library. I promise to avoid being profound or complicated... but the book is definitely for people who have a bit of background knowledge in not only Christianity, but in science, and perhaps universal consciousness. I obviously love the book enough to own it AFTER reading it! Perhaps that's all that needs to be said. The book does repeat sections for reflection/meditation... like another reviewer commented. They are worth revisiting!!!"
5,A Must Read Book for Those Who Wish to Deepen Their Spirituality,"Barbara Fiand provides the reader with the interpretations of the familiar Biblical passages. The provoking questions challenge the reader to enter into oneself to discover new insights which are more relevant to the world in which we live. This book is meant to be read more than once and to be the subject of discussion. Barbara puts her interpretations to us and leads us to some new meanings that we will discover deep within ourselves. Truly, In The Stillness You Will Know."
1,Do NOT do business with BargainCell!!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
5,BEST HEADPHONES EVER,Ok. so your sceptical about some 250 dollar headphones. GET OVER IT. these are by far the best headphones i have ever seen/heard. Top of the line professional quality. They were first recommended to me by a professional recording artist who raved about it over and over. They have the best sound quaility even out of a top of the line tube amp. They also are EXTREMELY comfortable over long periods of time aka don't hurt your ears even after 6+ hours of listening. Can also be quite compact if u need to transport. These are worth your money if u are lookin for some great sounding but not 600 dollar senheissers. Oh are also perfect for movie listening. Theres a reason it has surround sound in the name. I would recommend buying to anyone.
2,Great Sound POOR QUALITY,"I puchased about a year ago. They have only been used by an adult and they were pampered as the cost of these headphones is high. They sound great but the plastic keeps breaking away and now are held together with black tape. Now one of the ear pieces doesnt work at all so great sound is only half as good. I wouldnt highly recommend these because of the craftsmanship while good, the way they are constructed and materials used is not so good."
3,Review of Ultrasone HiFi 700 by John 11/07,"The sound was good but they were bigger than I expected and others could easily hear the sounds coming out of the headphones which is something I don't like. Also, they were expensive and I ultimately returned them. I was able to get smaller headsets, great sound, good outside noise cancelling and there was very little sound coming out of the headsets for people to hear what I'm playing and they were only $40.00. They are the excellent AKG-K26P Headsets. Very satisfied."
4,Affordable and sound exquisite,"I guess the affordable part is all relative, but they sound great and I do not regret the purchase at all. I am (re)experiencing and exploring my music unlike I have ever done before.Enjoy them!"
5,Great product!,"I am so glad someone makes a non-toxic lice killing shampoo! At first I used the RID stuff on my two-yr-old, then found out it has more pesticide than what people spray in the yard to kill bugs. (And we were putting it on our heads!?!) I then bought this gel for the second treatment. They shipped it fast and I was grateful. It worked - we had a bad case and are now free of lice! I also recommend the spray (sold separately) for mattresses, strollers, car seats, but you'll want a lot b/c the bottle goes fast. If you need to save $ I heard vinegar kills lice - my friend shampooed with that - you might try it. I used this gel, though and was very pleased. The comb is a nice one, too. They have a hotline (printed on the bottle 1-800-itching) that you can call with questions, which I used and they were very helpful."
1,Smells great but doesn't work great.,"I thought, sure, why not avoid the pestisides. It said to leave it in for an hour and I left it in for alot longer than that. It killed nothing and I'm not even sure if it did do anything. Smells like licorice though.LovLiv"
2,"Meh, Kino kind of disappointed me","I'm actually pretty darn disappointed with this show. I thought I'd love it, people recommend it and it gets great reviews. I don't know, I just couldn't get into it. Which kind of sucks, it was such a let down. The episodes are all creative and well written, they just din't do it for me. There's a lot of subtle elements to this show and I can see why everyone likes it. The best episode involves a town that warmly welcomes Kino and she befriends a little girl, I won't ruin it but that was a great episode. I'd give it a 3 star rating but I had to knock it down because of my disappointment. Ugh, maybe I'll have to re-watch it, maybe it'll grow on me. I really wanted to love this show."
3,detached lands (3.3),"In one land everything is done by robots, and another it feels like 13th century denmark or something. She takes a motorcycle ride and finds her self in a different time period each episode; pretty annoying for all the places to feel completely separate. Also a lot of the episodes just don't make any sense, or the moral of the story is so over bearing and over stated that it got on my nerves. Some good and some bad episodes, mostly meh, but Kino's Journey still manages to be a worthwhile watch."
3,Mediocre,"To the point... The anime definitely tries too hard to convey life lessons throughout the series. Most become utterly redundant and blatantly unnecessary which causes a ripple effect in regards to story progression. Most encounters were simply put to fill episodes and tried to relay some meaningless message, that could be simply understood through common sense alone. Perhaps if I was younger at heart and ignorant of the world, I'd find this journey to be more fulfilling."
4,Great Anime,"The premise makes for infinite plot lines, seemingly. Not exactly the deepest, or most action packed anime I've ever seen. However, a very quality addition to my collection, and really worth a watch for anyone who likes anime."
4,"weird, but lovely","I'm not through this anime yet, but I really like it. So far I adore it. I think it's weird and wonderful! It's not your typical action packed anime. It goes a bit slow for those of us used to fast paced, but it's more methodical/philosophical than most. It truly is an artistic storytelling, with lots of lessons entwined within the stories. (ex: living off of animals - one dies for the expense of another, helping others and then being betrayed, being a ""perfect adult"" etc...) It can be somewhat dark, but at the same time it's very cute! It's definitely a thinking person's anime. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Absolutely worth it,"wonderfully written anime. The characters are memorable, the stories are incredibly well written... you cannot go wrong with this one. The animation is spot-on, the soundtrack is pretty good, the voicework is great, and again... the writing is amazing. If you value story at all, you *must* pick this up."
3,Creative and Refreshing but Repetitive at the Same Time,"Perhaps I would have enjoyed this series more if I had watched it dubbed, but I chose subbed and never really got into it even though I did watch the entire show. The whole idea behind the show is simple: Kino travels around and witnesses bizarre lands with populations that live lifestyles that make no sense to us. There are definitely creative moments and also one hilarious episode in which Kino meets three separate men working along a railroad track, but overall Kino's Journey is far from riveting."
5,fantastic movie,"What a terrific movie. The music is just wonderful and fits the movie to a 'T'. I recently bought the CD at Borders, Books and Music (Dec 21, 03), because years ago I owned the LP!!! I was disappointed to find that the movie is only available on VHS though. Guess I'll reluctantly buy it because I'd love to laugh and cry all over again. Can't even rent this anymore, it's a shame. The good movies go and the junk is always rentable."
5,One of the rare cases of the movie being better than the book!,"I read the novel RAGTIME years ago and was rather underwhelmed possibly because of my prejudice at the time against books that mingle fiction with real historical characters and events - a literary style I have now come to accept and appreciate. Even so, the movie is much more enjoyable and emotionally moving than the novel. The sets and costumes look authentic, the acting is convincing and the film simply transports the viewer to the early 20th century. One caution, though the movie is rated PG, the version I saw on DVD had some scenes that would probably put it in the R category today and would definitely make it PG-13 though that rating did not exist in the early 1980's when the film was produced."
2,These cuts are moronic.,"What a stupid piece of vandalism to cut 40 minutes out of such a great picture! Fortunately the Region 2 version is complete, a good reason in itself to buy a multi-system DVD player."
4,Very Good Film,Milo Foreman Brought this Film really well together.I saw this Film recently again&remembered how much I truly dug it the first time but it had been a while.Howard Rollins was on Point here.Very Well-Casted&a Movie that truly makes you think&reflect.
2,not as good as i thought,musical parts were droped from the script... the story went to fast and was poorly directed....
2,Confusing Story Line,"I agree with the reviewer who said that the period detail was excellent, but if I hadn't seen the Broadway play, I wouldn't have known what the story was about. It was disjointed and difficult to follow. What was interesting about this piece was the number of recognizable stars who are well known now but were early in their careers like Jeff Daniels, Fran Drescher, Brad Dourif and Ethan Phillips (Neelix in Voyager).Howard Rollins, James Olsen and James Cagney were wonderful as was Kenneth McMillan (Willie Conklin). But I had difficulty believing Sarah as a love interest for Coalhouse.Unfortunately, the movie only held my family's interest because we had seen the play and maybe that's part of the problem. The play was so well done that we found the film storyline lacking and very hard to follow, especially at the beginning."
2,Have not yet received item,"I have not yet received this item. I have e-mailed seller requesting a tracking number or something that would help me locate the item, but to date I have received no response. Since I ordered this item in mid-June, it is my assumption that perhaps the item is not available for deliver. Please refund my purchase since I have not yet seen it. Thank you."
5,Underrated Classic,"A complex, engaging, colorful, masterpiece. Milos Forman has never disappointed as a director. Typical of him, he captures America better than just about any American director. The cast is superb. Howard Rollins, Jr. is nothing short of amazing as Coalhouse Walker, Jr. Elizabeth McGovern, Mary Steenburgen, James Olson and Brad Dourif also give great performances.I have admittedly not read the book, nor have I seen the Broadway musical. I don't know what EL Doctorow thinks about the movie of his book (I gather he is not crazy about it). But the film has a wonderful pace and the soundtrack is stunning as well.I think it is a crime that the soundtrack is not available on cd and the movie not available on DVD!"
1,Don't Bother,"Worst adaptation of a book since Marjorie Morningstar. Poor pacing, poor acting and the screenwriters and director clearly did NOT understand E.L. Doctorow's beautifully written, wonderful novel.Watch this only if you want to see how NOT to adapt a book."
4,Ragtime rocks,It captures the spirit of the age and is mostly true to the original book but has by necessity to omit several sub plots. I recommend reading the book first.
3,Ragtime,"I thought the begining of the book was confusing and hard to follow, but a it pogressed, I felt it was interesting how all the characters intertwined. The movie is definetly different than the book, but I think I appreciate the book a lot more"
1,"Great movie, bad delivery","This was my first time viewing a movie on Amazon. Not worth the effort, or the price! You need to do much work on that."
4,Cotton Club revisited,"""The Cotton Club"" revisited or maybe the other way around, this is another 20's period piece - which is not necessarily a bad thing. This, I believe, was James Cagney's last movie. It's easy to see why he's a master. Again, multiple stories unfold simultaneously. A little more sex & nudity adds some zest to one of the storylines. All in all, entertaining & worth the investment."
4,A Young Adults Book with Intelligant Morals,"I read this book first when i was tweleve and it is by far one of my favorite books. It is definetly geared at young adults, but it also tends to be very dark. The premise is a young boy who is incredibly brilliant but hides his talents. He lives in an oprhange near a secret tower which he uses as his secure castle. He becomes adopted by a man inprisoned by his orderly attitude and lack of affection. Their are many twists in the book which makes you keep reading. The greatest part of the book though are the charecters which could be seen as weak, such as a simple hunter who carries an unloaded gun. this man is a metaphor for Gilly, the young boy, himself. He has potential and protection with his talents but keeps them to himself, which is as useless as an unloaded gun. This is again, an excellant book with deep metaphors and morals"
4,Exciting...gets you pumped!!,"This book takes you to a scary place where you feel like Gilly will never get out. I love the characters, how they act, and the bravery from dear Mash...the beloved dog. I started this wonderful book and finished it in the same day, becasue once you get started you have to finish it!~Enjoy"
2,this book is not good.,"Julia Cunningham's book has little to offer. The premise is not unreasonable, and may appeal to readers seeking a story about overpowering and then insulting an abusive pseudo-father figure. But mostly I found this slim book thin on character, plot, and just about anything else one would find valuable in a story. The illustrations are also no good."
4,A little outdated,"Written in 2005/2006, it's a little outdated now that we have Obama/Reid/Pelosi governing in America.Still, good message about downsizing government and releasing people's individual initiative and creative energies."
5,Healing a Heart Ache,"This is a wonderful book to bring up someones spirits after a death of a loved one. I was given this book after my mom died and found it very comforting, so I purchased it for a friend when her father died."
5,It Fits,"If you or someone special has experienced a loss, this book ""fits"" the gap, the hole, that is always felt.The author has obviously experienced her personal loss or tragedy, and as everyone knows, any person's loss can be better understood by someone who has also experienced the same type of loss. That could be a death, an illness, accident, personal relationship--- any of life's tragic happenings.These few pages will lift the spirit and urge the reader to view the situation as an opportunity, rather than a reason to despair.I usually keep a copy on hand to give as a gift when the occasion seems appropriate."
2,depressing,This book is for someone going through a rough time. Not for people who are in a good place. I found it very depressing.
4,My Beautiful Broken Shell,"This is a perfect gift for a close friend or family member who has experienced a loss. It is well received by anyone I have presented it to, and I have always gotten very thought filled feedback from the recipient. It is not necessarily for those who are dealing with death, but for any loss, and especially for someone who in the process - or is trying to begin the process of healing.My Beautiful Broken Shell: Words of Hope to Refresh the SoulA very good choice!"
5,Beautifully written!!,This is a perfect little book for someone who has lost a loved one. The illustrations are just lovely and it is written in a way that is very meaningful.
4,Shell #1,"This was one of several copies ordered for close friends. Although four were ordered, one was found to be unavailable, though originally indicated being in stock; one alternate book was mistakenly sent, rather than the one ordered; but two arrived as requested and were quite impressive, especially considering the relative costs. This was my first experience in ordering hard copy books and although there were some inconveniences, I was still sufficiently satisfied and intend to continue to use the services. I have yet to contact Amazon in an attempt to exchange the book that was sent in error."
1,waste of money!,I bought it after reading all the reviews. What a let down. It should be classified under books for children. Check it out at the library before spending your money on it.
2,Cheap!,I bought this thing because my old one has screw driver like handles on it and it kills your hands. The firsd time I used it the handle came off when I tried to pull it out of the tire. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,It's a'ight,"For 50 bucks, I think you could spend your money better. I got this like 5 years ago and it was in my price range, so whatever. The screen resolution is pretty good. It looks like they cut a piece of LCD screen from a 19"" 1440*900 lcd screen, so you can get an idea of dot pitch. What's nice is the formats it supports, it supports a lot of picture formats, and Kodak picture CDs. Unfortunately, no DivX."
2,The drums got lost.....,"I have the original LP. The performance is excellent. However this CD was either processed from alternate takes or someone just screwed up. In some cuts the beautiful drum work (particularly the brushes) which supports and enhances Coleman's piano just isn't there. I haven't played the original recording in many years but I've always remembered the subtle interplay between Coleman and the drummer (Charlie Smith)as they end ""A Foggy Day"". The first time I listened to this disc was a real letdown when that ending just wasn't there. Further listening revealed a lot of the drum work gone. If you're interested in a good re-issue of the original recording this isn't it."
5,Much-Needed Encouragement,"Every woman who has been trapped in a terrible marriage out of guilt and fear, bombarded by all sides with the so-called statistics of divorce damage to society at large, owes it to herself to read this book. After all the dollars and angst I spent deciding to end my marriage, this book gave me the strength and support to finally follow through. I thank the author for helping me get my life back, and making me a stronger, saner parent for my children than I ever was while in the crazy-making hell of my marriage."
3,It is a bit dated....,"A lot of the information is dated, but I could make it work for me. I think it is a very empowering book though. I am not an advocate of divorce but sometimes it can't be helped......"
5,Life after divorce brings an exhilarating message of freedom,"What an enlightening book! One assumes that most women feel devastated after divorce; but here Applewhite interviews dozens of women who initiated their own divorces, and records their senses of freedom and accomplishment.She has taken a difficult approach--weaving the many stories into a coherent whole that makes cogent points, rather than just doing a chapter on each person--and she has managed it masterfully. The book not only makes sense and gives valuable advice, it's fascinating reading. By the end, one feels intimately acquainted with these women, their spouses and the author herself--and, most importantly, with what they learned.I purchased two copies of ""Cutting Loose"" for newly divorced friends, and they have thanked me over and over for its exhilarating message."
1,Thin on advice.....,I really didn't like this book because it's thin on any advice and long on stories about other women's situations. I couldn't find anything that really related to my own. It's also so loosely structured it's difficult to grasp the point of the book.Don't waste your money.
2,Father of four children,Cutting Loose is a collection of opinions from the exceedingly small minority of women who have found divorce uplifting. The realty is divorce for the large majority of women is a negative life altering experience. Readers should be cautioned that having a positive divorce experience is similar in odds to becoming an olympic athlete.
1,Head in the Clouds,"This author is not in touch with reality. I found her conclusions flawed. Her sampling method and technique is lacking and tends to overlook women who have made a mistake. She also tends to blame husbands for the problems that these woman had. They seem to be examples of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water."""
2,Trivialization of the romantic condition and love,"It is unfortunate that the author has not had a decent relationship in her life, otherwise she would know that some things are worth working for and not to just give up and strike out on one's own."
4,Eye Candy,"This book presents men in various settings that are sepia toned, many of whom are in an aroused state. That and good photography make this a must have for lovers of nude male."
2,Not so much,"As a photographer, I collect a wide variety of photo art books. Of all of the male figure study books I've collected, this would be my least favorite. To me, it seems far less about art and more about the photographer's obsession with very well-hung men and hangs closer to porn than art. I don't have a problem with porn, but it's not what I was shopping for and I probably won't be holding on to this book.That said, there are a handful of creative and intriguing photos in here. But not many."
5,Finding Funny in Fury,"Decoster's art of finding humor in life's spurs is an inspiration! If you care for the comedy of John Leguizamo, you'll love this book!"
2,Doesn't hold paint,I purchased my new home and attempted to paint my entire house. I purchased a set of these rollers and tried my best to paint. I do not understand for the life of me why ANYONE would paint with an item that has holes in the middle. I dipped it into the tray and the paint fell through the holes. I splashed some paint with a cup onto the wall and used the roller again - the wall got all cut up. Now I'm living in a home with paint splashed everywhere and metal tracks riding up and down my walls. Don't waste your money.
4,a little too wide,"This roller works great. Would recommend you use a large paint roller pan though. The 9"" pans are not wide enough to accept the wire frame of the roller."
1,Rubbish,"Thought this was a better quality roller, Its not, painted out 2 houses with it and now the spindels worn out on the frame end causing the roller wobble about, plus the thread in the hand is too big for( not only standard size)but thewooster & Sherlock roller pole as well! = Rubbish!"
1,Garbage,"My husband is a painting contractor and has used Wooster roller handles forever, these however are junk. Don't waste your money."
2,Motor Meltdown,"My husband bought me a Kitchenaid stand mixer quite a few years ago. I have used it about 20 times. In fact, I use it almost exclusively during the holidays, because gingerbread dough can be pretty tough to knead by hand. Yesterday I was making my yearly batch of gingerbread, and the motor heated up and started smoking like crazy! I know it's way too late to expect anything from the company, but it's a bad sign that this machine, which has not even seen much use, completed melted down when kneading cookie dough. Not sure I will replace this with another Kitchenaid!"
4,"Good, but....","I do LOVE my KitchenAid mixer, I have had mine for about 6-8 years now and use it regularly (it really gets a workout during the holidays!). The BUT part is that it leaks oil. Quite a bit. And has been doing so since about year 2 of ownership. KitchenAid will not help...when I called they said that it would eventually stop, and unless I had the receipt (which by then I didn't) they wouldn't do anything about it. So from time to time I do dream of getting a new mixer that doesn't leak oil, but until this one breaks down (because seriously, how MUCH oil can this dang thing have in it?! It may be producing oil now for all I know!) I will make do."
4,"Good, but avid chefs should get Artisan","I got this from my Mom as a gift 6 years ago. After years of abuse and multiple times putting more into it than suggested, I have killed it. I'm a little annoyed that it's no longer working, but I really did abuse the thing. I plan on getting the larger size. I have loved using this and hopefully the bigger motor and capacity of the next model up will make it last longer.For reference: I use this to bake breads, pizza doughs, pastries, cookies, and cakes. Many of my recipes are ""ovesized"" due to growing up in a large family."
2,leaking seal,I have had this mixer for 5 vyears and use it occasionaly. The seal on the mixer shaft leaks oil into the bowl. KitchenAid says this is normal and one should use the mixer at least once a week to stop the leakage. This is a poor solution to the problem! This seal on the shaft needs a redesign. Be aware of this problem. This is a common problem. Check the internet to find other comments.
4,Great except for daily bread dough kneading,"I love this mixer. I've had it for over two years, and I love how fast it whips cream, how thoroughly and quickly it mixes cookie dough, and I love how smooth and elastic bread dough turns out with this appliance. Be warned though, if you bake bread daily like I do, it will wear out the gaskets in about six weeks. I've had it repaired twice now due to this problem. I love the mixer, and I love homemade bread, so I think I just need one with a more powerful motor. I would recommend this mixer to a friend (and have!)"
4,Fun to have,It is a nice blender. I have used it once so far and it is great not to have to rest your hand in the middle of a mix. Very easy to use and easy to clean.
5,Attachments,"This review isn't really all about the mixer but more about the attachments. The best part that I like about the attachments are that I can operate and make Pasta, Sausage, etc, all alone. You don't need any help to make any thing you want. The attachments clean up easily."
3,SPLATTERS,"THIS ITEM , ALTHOUGH IT WORKS GREAT IT HAS A PROBLEM WITH SPLATTERS AS BEATING STARTS , EVEN ON SLOW. THERE NEEDS TO BE A COVER OF SOME KIND TO PREVENT THIS PROBLEM. OTHER WISE IT IS A VERY STURDY MACHINE."
5,What a great resource! Just what I was looking for.,"This book really lives up to its title. It answers all the questions anyone might have about the process of becoming a teacher. I found it interesting, thoughtful, and thought provoking in addition to being incredibly informative. I would recommend it to anyone thinking about becoming a teacher."
2,Disappointing,"Many stories in this collection are just ... or disturbing for the sake of being so. Several didn't even really have any plot to speak of. There were a few gems, some whose basic plot had potential to graduate to full books, but many lacked originality or taste. If I simply want erotica without much story I can frankly read ... forums. C. Tan should have read some more L.K. Hamilton's work and only let shorts that had somewhere close to that level of plot in to this collection (as I said there were a couple that really had potential). All in all, if you can find it cheap enough it would be worth it just for the few shorts that make the rest of the muck bearable. And don't forget that in short story collections you can always just skip 10 pages or so and read a totally new and unconnected story, as I often had to (something very unusual for me)."
3,"For the small, left handed coffee drinker","I got this coffee mug today and while it is really great looking the handle is very very small, and i have a very large hand so holding this mug is difficult. My other complaint is how the logo is only on one side and since i am right handed the logo is facing towards me when i drink it so noone else can bask in the glory of all that is Chicago Bears football anyway other than that it does its job which is to hold a cup of joe. so drink up and enjoy and as far as i know this company makes all of the teams in the NFL. And shipping for this was super fast it got to me in a week and im in Afghanistan."
5,Classic quilt patterns,I needed a quilt pattern that is printed in this book. The patterns are historic ones because they were included on the packaging of Mountain Mist quilt batts. They are famous and familiar patterns loved by many modern quilters. I would and do recommend it to my quilter friends.
4,Mountain Mist book,Good little Mountain Mist info and pattern book. Would have liked to have had more pictures of Mountain Mist quilts as I am more into history than piecing them.
5,Easy mini weather station,"This product was easy to install. You need to be sure to read the instructions regarding the installed batteries as they do have to be removed and reinstalled. The weather station has been extremely accurate with both outside and inside temperatures. It is nice to get up in the morning and know the outside temperature without having to open the door and feel outside! The weather prediction has also been acurrate, but you need to remember that it is forcasting 12-24 hours in advance and not the weather for the exact time you are reading it. It does give a chance for you to make tentative plans for the next day. It's nice knowing whether the barometer is raising or falling."
2,no backlight,The Idea of the product is good. However the product has no lighting at all on it. This has been troublesome considering you set your alarm at night (when it is dark) and you usually wake up when it is dark. Because there is no backlight you can't see the time or temp.
1,Worst documentary EVER,I bought this dvd last year. I agree with the other reviews posted on here. What a piece of JUNK!!! I am a U2 fan (music and film fan in general). The title is completely misleading. No U2 and no U2 music. Just a bunch of sad people telling boring stories about the good ol days in Ireland in the places where u2 atteneded school. Do NOT waste your time or your money on this DVD.
1,Horrible piece of junk that should never be sold,"I couldn't agree more with the other reviews. I went ahead and counted my loss on this one and moved forward. I felt so sick after watching this, that i decided to throw it away instead of having to put another diehard U2 fan through this misery. I hate this so much, and i wish it would just hurry up and be discontinued."
5,Not a single weak track!,"This one of the few perfect cds I have. You'll never need to skip a song because all are great. These women are top artists making a dream team, the songwriting is amazing and the production is absolutely on target."
2,Nice for a 2nd album..,Not as moved as I was with her 1st album. Don't think she is able to top that one yet.
4,Lost treasure!! Buy it!!,"I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD. It was available on Japanese laserdisk and video a few years ago. It is a video of a concert held in the late sixties in a warehouse or hanger in Britain. The cast of musicians is amazing. Colosseum ( tragically all but forgotten in the US)with Dick Heckstall Smith and John Hiseman, a throw together band with Stephen Stills, Buddy Miles and jack Bruce performing Black Queen, performances by Roland Kirk, the Modern Jazz Quartet and others. A highlight is Eric Clapton (ala Blind Faith era) on a Gibson Firebird getting cut by Buddy Guy. I'm giving it 4 stars only because of the slight hippy visual effects (not overly done) and relative poor audio quality of the video (which might have been cleaned up on the DVD version) as well as the omission of the Led Zeppelin track (included on the 2003 Led Zep DVD collection). If you want to treat yourself to a unique jam session, check this out."
1,An absolutely atrocious DVD.,"I cannot even begin to write an objective review of the material itself, because the video and audio quality are so incredibly poor that I was unable to view more than two minutes before I turned it off. An absolutely appalling transfer. Perhaps the worst 5.1 audio I have ever heard. DO NOT BUY THIS DISC."
4,minor correction,"Buy this if you like other performances of the listed performers. Buddy Miles, Jack Bruce and Buddy Guy playing together on the same stage? Priceless. But please ignore the review about Glenn Campbell appearing here before he crossed over to play country music. Both Glen Campbell and Glenn Ross Campbell play really well but only one of them makes an appearance here."
2,Not What I Hope For,"In 1987, I ordered the VHS version of this concert from a video club I belonged to. When the DVD format came out, I kept my eyes open for this title thinking that the sound and video would be cleaned up. I was delighted when I saw the title come available and ordered it. The quality of the VHS format was better than the DVD. The second disappointment was the Led Zeppelin performance being cut. Luckily for me, I still have the VHS version and it's still in good shape.The quality of the sound and video has as much to do with the crews that recorded it as it does the transfer, I guess. Still, this is a good show and worth the cost for those who can't get enough!"
2,showcases Buddy Guy's talent/ very little Clapton,I bought this to see another pairing of the great Buddy Guy and Eric Clapton. There isn't much Clapton at all. The audio is pretty bad. The only redeeming thing about it is the fact it shows several good performances by Mr. Guy
2,DAMN GOOD BUT...,This is a great performance marred by poor sound & picture. What a shame! If you can forgive these drawbacks this real treat includes a rare Rahsaan Roland Kirk playing with the great Buddy Guy which alone is worth the price. Could someone out there reading this please re-master this precious classic show?
2,A bit of background re Eric Clapton's performance,"This concert was filmed on March 17-18, 1969 at Stines Television Studios in Middlesex England. Eric Clapton was right in the middle of recordings for Blind Faith. Interesting that Jack Bruce is onstage with Clapton just months after Cream's breakup on Everything's Gonna be Alright, which features Clapton and Guy's blazing solos.An excellent concept but a flawed movie, as it was poorly recorded, syncronized and edited."
5,Excellent treatment of the myriad aspects of client/server,"We use this book as the required textbook for a graduate-level computer science course I teach at Boston University. It does an excellent job presenting a zillion different topics, and pulls them together better than any other book I've seen. I particularly like the Soapbox sections that are clearly marked as representing the authors' opinions. Server hardware architecture is the only critical subject area where one wishes for more. The Third Edition covers the latest technologies, e.g., XML, with clear, easily understood examples. This book is approachable enough to be useful in a graduate business school class on managing technology projects. Conversely, for the techno-savvy, it is not terribly detailed, but it provides a great jumping-off point for further research."
5,Pretty much the best on this subject,"I've recommended the second edition of this book to my students for a while now, despite the fact that it is several years out of date. I was thrilled when I found out they'd written a third edition.I've yet to find any other text that comes close to covering the same material."
5,"Covers A Lot, Easy to Understand","If you are not familiar with the Client/Server and Web programming jargon and/or are having trouble figuring out how all of the pieces fit together, this book is for you.You'll need to get past some of the 'cuteness' that the authors use to make their points. However, they cover the topic soup to nuts in a way that you will understand going forward.I picked up the first edition of the book by accident when I was trying to figure out fat client server computing and subsequently bought the other two versions to get more overview and to use as a desk reference (i.e. I had to explain the concept of ACID properties of transactions and needed a brush up)Lastly, if your manager is non-technical, do yourself a favor and get him/her a copy of this book."
4,Great thriller!!,"Good thriller. great performances from Eric Roberts and John Lithgow. Mädchen Amick, beautiful woman. Please, I want it on dvd"
3,Garybaldi - 'Nuda' (CGD),"Originally released in 1972, this was the Italian progressive band's first of two albums. Main two tracks that I personally got the most out of were the creative-sounding seven-minute ""26 Febbraio 1700"" and the three-part nineteen-minute epic ""Moretta Da Brescia: a) Goffredo b) II Giardino Del Re c) Dolce Come Sei Tu"". Some have noted that this first Garybaldi lp was heavily influenced by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Not sure if I would agree with that or not, but 'Nuda' is worth checking out. Line-up: Bambi Fossatti - guitar & vocals, Angelo Traverso - bass, Lio Marchi - keyboards and Maurizio Cassinelli - drums & vocals. A title to pull out every now and again when you're wanting to listen to something different."
5,good songs he sings,"I'm looking for his songs on CD. I reccomeded his song from Mr.K(He was a owner of record shop in Tokyo)about 25years ago.He reccomended me his LP ,R.F.D , Devil Woman , Drifter and others.This set includes my favorite two songs Melba form Melbourne and Devil Woman."
5,"Salsoul in 12"" format!","Am I glad I bought this one! A previously unreleased rare gem by the great Loleatta Holloway, ""I May Not Be There"" in a glorious 10:21 minutes. Besides that cut, 4 others were either previously unavailable or unissued. And as the CD title says, in their 12"" format. A must have!"
1,Not Good,"Even though the sound quality is good, there is only 8 track on the cd, which by my standards, isn't many!"
4,The only book to have!,"As a medical intern, I have utilized many different books/manuals in the hospital and outpatient setting. This book is by far, the most complete and satisfying source that I have ever used. The algorhythms are clearly written, and provide information on diagnosis and treatment based upon current guidelines. It is a must buy!"
4,Seems nice,"Hello,I have looked through some of this, but not read it all, i like its size and it seems helpful and will be added as part of my medical kit. I like how it organizes information into categories such as Common Illnesses and then other uncommon ones or something like that. Helps to know what commonly occurs and what doesnt. Information on drugs given in the table should be helpful i think.- Jason"
1,Where was the editor?,"This book would have been a lot better if the author had stuck to discussing the prophesies of St. Malachy (preferably in a scholarly rather than sarcastic tone). Instead he went off on a bizarre rant against the Catholic Church. It didn't seem to belong in this book. If he wanted to do a critique of the Catholic Church that should have gone in another book entitled ""My Critique of the Catholic Church""...I'm not even Catholic and I found his critique offensive."
1,A terrible book,This book is extremely offensive to Christians in general and Catholics in particular. His basic thesis is that the Christian faith is based on forgery and lies. He also singles out a few Popes who were flawed and makes claims about church documents which he claims were forged uses that to convince us that the Catholic Church is about to sink into oblivion. Curiously he claims that the prophecies of St Malachy were forged in the 16th century then admits that the forger was a great prophet because the prophecies are very accurate even after the date of the supposed forgery. At the end of the book he states that he thinks the Holy Roman Catholic Church is demonically possessed and he is happy to face the lake of fire for saying so. I feel sorry for the man because he has called eternal damnation on himself. If you are curious about the Prophecies of St Malachy please look elsewhere because this man is trying to lead people astray.
1,Zero scholarship. No academic merit.,More anti-Catholic drivel from yet another radical New Ager. An intellectually challenged one at that. Books such as this one deserve less than a one-star rating.
1,Another Bigot Bashes Christians/Catholics,This book was so hate-filled and dishonest. I lost count of all the lies and half-truths in this book. The author is such a brazen bigot and he desperately needs to take some history classes.
1,Worst book i ever read!!,"This is the only book i have ever purchased that i not only thought was horrible, but i also threw away in the garbage (I am not going to resell this filth to someone else). As other commenters have said, this book was an anti-christian rampage, not a book on prophecy. The author basically feels that anything old (traditional) is bad, anything new (secular progressive) is great, and that you must be a moron to believe as people have in the past, now that we are ""enlightened."" yeah right, things are getting so much better now!! Remember the Russians in 1917 and the Germans in 1930s who wanted ""CHANGE"" and got something new and enlightened? Look what they got, Communism and Nazism. News to the author (and others in America who just want ""change"" for change's sake), something New/Change can be good or bad....i wanted to read a book on prophecy, not get John Hogue's narrow opinion on the Catholic/Christian Church and how their ideas of 2000 years ago are stupid."
4,Radically Carman,"Carman knows how to put on a concert. And it even shows through the album. From start to finish, you can imagine yourself there, lights and all.There is a lot of classic-style Carman on this album. He has always known how to get his audience, even an audience of one, to let loose through his songs. From ""I've Been Delivered"" to ""Soap Song"" you will be foot-tapping and hand clapping right along with the concert audience."
1,Carmen Radically Saved,The item did not work too well when received quick delivery but product did not work I guess I got what I paid for it.
3,All Around Great Reference,"Provides in-depth material on all types of network topics, plus some good information on why to implement a network.Some of the diagrams are too small and hard to read."
3,Needs better cross reference,Index is lacking. Not every technical term is indexed nor defined in the glossary. A good general reference on all network conecepts.
4,Finally!!,"Cameron's hair books are more expensive than most of my books ever purchased at University-:). But, I finally managed to find a decent priced used copy on Amazon! All I can say is that this book is amazing styling for long hair. The pics are great and the instructions are easy to follow. It would be great if he'd do a book for short hair too!"
5,Great First Day Material,"This is a classic Kindergarten book worth reading on the first day of school...helps those little ones relate to each other and to Annabelle Swift! You may also like the ""Miss Bindergarten"" books!"
1,Piece of Junk-Don't buy it!,"When I first saw this series, (my friend had bought the dvds) it looked pretty cool. But I was soon to learn that this was not so. Big O was practically invincible, and the battles were pretty boring. Dorothy didn't have much personality, and was quite annoying. And The city's people were all insecure cowards. The series was just plain stupid. I know I cannot help those who have a low IQ and have actually bought the first DVD and liked it, but for those who are smart and read about all the consecutive DVDs (or VHSs) in the series, DON'T BUY THIS SERIES! For a much better alternative (along with a halfway-decent plot) I suggest any of the gundam series, preferably gundam wing-incredible plot, great action."
5,THIS IS ANIMATION AT ITS GREATEST!,"This animated, action packed, mind-blowing movie is out of this world! Not only is it a movie, but also a cartoon that aired on the cartoon network program, toonami. The cartoon series was just as awesome as the movie. unfortunately, the production of the cartoon was stopped. why stop such cool animation? beats me. Its terrible that they've stopped work on such an awesome cartoon. Let's hope the animators haven't REALLY given up on Big O and that they'll make more of his animation to be seen. But the movie is a movie for people who like action and mystery. This movie keeps you yearning to know more about the past-less city called Paragdim City, and makes you wonder what's around the next corner. All eyes are glued on Roger Smith, a negotiator, who calls upon a megadeus called Big O, when Paragdim City is under attack. This is almost like a ""virtual"" movie, only without all of the virtual-ness!"
1,pass on this yawner,"This is just another ""male comic book."" my buds and me had a good laugh over some of Meadows' claims to ""insider knowledge"" he makes in the story. He also uses a lot of technical jargon and technical descriptions in place of solid action plotting and dialog that has a real ring to it instead of words that sound like they came off any dozen action flicks. The plot and action scenes are what make or break a book of this type but five guys who are real-life versions of the characters in the story flung the book at the wall before they finished the first twenty pages. Come on, warrior brother, you can do better than this, (even if you have to make it all up). In the meantime I suggest readers get hold of a copy of Strike Force Baghdad by Mark K. Roberts, a much better book all around."
1,"Trite, Predictable and Boring as Hell","I honestly found this book boring and predictable. It just dragged along. It seemed like the writer just ""phoned it in."" The plot was nothing great, just the usual potboiler fare based loosely on current events (pilots on a mission are forced down into terrorist-infested territory and have to improvise in their fight to survive -- you've seen it all before) that tries a little too hard to get beyond the limitations of a pretty thin story. I enjoy reading action novels every now and then, and there are some I've read more than once, but this one fizzled out fairly quickly and never recovered."
5,YOU JUST FOUND THE CD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!!!,"This is an AWSOME Carman CD. It includes REALLY good soft songs, and REALLY cool rock songs. I listen to this CD almost every night as I go to sleep. If you are looking for a good Carman CD (or any good CD at that,) you just found it!"
3,Carmens Best,This is a collection of the best of Carman. I have never really been a fan of his music but if you had to buy one of his CDs this would probably be the one. He is a master showman and puts on rally great shows/performances. This Cd doesnt lack any of the bells/whistles he puts into those. He has some very powerful lyrics and some prais and worship songs on this CD. It has a mix of studio and live songs. Like I said he put a lot of production into these songs.
3,Ehhh...could have been better,"This is a decent compliation from Carman,although it's missing some other hits,and I could have done without so many ""live"" versions of some of these songs.I did love the last song on this CD though,""Serve The Lord"".Which was the previously unreleased track on here.But I thought there should have been more songs on this disc.Such as ""Witches Invitation"",""Our Turn Now"" and ""Satan,Bite The Dust"".But oh well.I guess you can't have EVERYTHING the way you want it.Overall.Just an ok CD...in MY opinion anyway."
4,"The Love Of Family, The Essence Of Life","All the props in the world to author Denene Millner for taking the screenplay and turning it into a hugely readable novelization.It is nearly an impossible project to pull off successfully, since the author typically cannot deviate from material written for the big screen. Millner surely was limited to the number of words for the book and - because of that - my only criticism is the chapters needed titles to better transition the fast forwarding of the years/settings.But she aptly covers the racism, rivalries, heartbreaks and redemption brilliantly depicted in the movie. This is a story as much about family as anything else. And if you can't love family - as difficult as that may be at times - how can you love anyone else?"
2,STATS The Scouting Notebook 2002,"Does not supply the type of information that any serious fan wants. Almost like reading the back of a baseball card. Theauthors do not reach for the type of info the serious seamhead wants. Typical comments such as ""has a good glove"" abound. Don'twaste your time."
5,Exact product match,We ordered and received the product which fit the machine and worked perfectly. The product arrived quicker than anticipated as well.
4,Old School Anime,"It was alright for an old school anime, serious but ridiculous at the same time - the animation is what you would expect from that time period"
5,Severely Underrated Series,"I strongly believe that this series has gotten the short end of the stick from many anime fans. I believe this is mainly because these fans attempt to compare it to the first series...which from what I've heard is something completely different. I picked this up at a local DVD shop and, having never seen the first series, had no expectations. I really enjoyed this series. It has drama and edge not found in any series I've seen before and the characters were very realistic and I had an easy time identifying with them (in stark contrast to the first series). I believe that if you're looking for an excellent drama, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for ""fun"", then you should move elsewhere."
2,Where the fun,"Got this as a present, I love the OVA and the manga but this was so different, wonder if by the same people who do Tenji over and over. The nuku nuku, I like is funny, where this is angsty teen love with mysterious stranger, I have no idea how it ends I got bored and never finished. Give me more of girl chasing mice, going crazy for catnip and crashing her bike because of cute cat in the window."
4,Memory Foam,The foam is indeed 3 inches thick but it took at least 4-5 days for it to fully expand and it is somewhat smaller than my queen size mattress. It is very comfortable and overall a good buy.
4,Pretty good,I've had this pad for about a week now. Its well worth the price. I found this to be the cheapest foam pad i could find from amazon and a few other sites. I originally had a latex mattress that is 4inchs from ikea. I still felt the slatted bed base below from just the mattress so i decided to buy a padder and this one has worked well. i sleep much better now that i dont feel the wooden bed base.
3,You get what you pay for,"This is very cheap memory foam (the price and quality). I can't really complain though, considering what I paid for it. The mattress topper definitely made my futon bed more comfortable, but the pillows I don't like. The shipping was fast and free, but in retrospect I probably would have shopped around for something a little better and paid the few extra bucks."
3,"ok if order larger size, but pillows are irregular at best","Pillows cut irregularly very roughly, very uncomfortable and seem discolored with partial yellow faded foam. Pillows look pretty oddly shaped like cut by a small child, and one is size for an infant, other child sized. Topper itself is ok but I ordered king size for queen size bed, and cut an inch or two off all sides, fits great. Can I return just the pillows?"
2,Expensive piece of fire hazardous foam - Stay away!,"As soon as I unpacked the package, and saw a warning label that this foam is fire hazardous, I was worried. It warns that the foam will burn quickly when contacts fire and consumes all oxygen in the room?! Any how, I gave it a try since I already bought it, but the foam is not really memory foam. I laid on it for only 5 minutes and it felt warm underneath. I tried for one night on top of my king mattress, but got terrible backache in the morning. Definitely not recommended! Save yourself trouble, and save your back, don't buy this product!"
4,Foam Mattress,"Overall comfortable, but expected it to feel a little softer. I still like it though and it fit the bed perfectly. I do sleep a lot better than before. Definetely good deal for the price!!"
3,Not impressed,"This is an improvement to my old mattress, but I'm doubtful that it's memory foam. When I press my hand into it, it's only memory is that it returns to its original state. I have had it only a month, so don't know how it will hold up. I'll look for something else when this gives out and not pay as much. The conyour pillow is more ""memory foam"" than the pad is."
4,Awsome,shipping was fast got the product in about a week. had been dreaming of this pad everynight sence i ordered it. i opened it up put it on the bed and was like laying on a cloud im in love wiht it i didnt want to wake up the next morning for work. the reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was when i opened the box the mattress was rolled super tight and had shrink wrap around it once i got the shrink wrap off the pad had a god awfull smell to it for a day or 2 from the wharehouse. i sprayed it down a few times with some odor killer to get ride of it. othere wise i would recommend this to all my friends.
5,Cool and Comfortable,"As a contractor in Afghanistan, creature comforts are rare. The military puts money into food, water and air conditioning, not nice matresses. Most of the mattresses here have been through several rotations, and have springs popping out everywhere!Let me start out by saying that any comparison made is between with and without this product, not between this product and competitors. That said, this mattress topper has me sleeping like a baby after tossing and turning on barely covered springs for weeks. I have found in the past that mattress coveres like this can get hot and damp, but I have had mine for a week and have not yet noticed that at all.Shipping was quick (for an FPO/APO address) at about 10 days."
3,Works for me!,I needed something fast to make a temporary bed more comfortable and this did the job. When I finish using it for myself it will go into the guest bedroom. This 3 inch memory foam mattress topper definitely does the trick and will make your bed instantly comfortable. I used it temporarily but you definitely could use it as the final solution for a hard or sagging mattress. I would have given four stars but I took away one star because I found the bed pillows too soft and thin.
5,!,This product is awesome! I have friends who have the actual temperpedic and i cant tell the difference at all!!
4,great memory foam enhancer,This memory foam enhancer turned out really nice. My daughter found it truly helped the hospital bed she was sleeping on. Getting it to the destination it was meant to be sent to was a completely different story. I have always been such a fan of Amazon but this has changed everything.....they were horrible to deal with and I will probably never purchase anything using Amazon again.
2,"Looking Back, Not Impressed","I purchased this my sophomore year of college and loved it at the time. That said, 2 years later I've purchased a 1.5"" memory foam topper from Walmart (Canopy brand) and I am NOT impressed with my one from college at all!1: the pillow is a joke.2: Everything turned YELLOW with age. My sheets were white. No joke, it's all yellow/orange now.3: The whole handprint thing? Yeah, you can't do it on this stuff because it's simply that low-density.My advice: buy a Canopy brand topper from Walmart instead. More options, w better, and slightly cheaper. Don't want to pay sales tax? Buy it from the online store. :) You can get their memory foam pillows, too, which are AWESOME."
3,Sleep Studio Mattress & Pillow Combo,"The set was missing the curvy pillow when it arrived. It also has a ""spine""caused from the packing method that looks as though it will never go completely away. The edges have no finish to them at all - they are simply cut off. Size is not very generous either. However, the memory of the material and insulation against bedspring poke-through is quite good - I'd say it's a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10."
4,Amazing difference!,I absolutely love this product...it has saved me from having to purchase a whole new mattress! I am very pleased with the product and the shipping and the customer service! WOW!!!
2,so so made.,Compared to serta memory foam topper is not good. Cheap made. Pillows are good for car seat's topper for my son.
2,You get what you pay for,"I have now had this for 2 months and it still has not decompressed from being shipped. It does not look like the picture, it isn't bad for the price, but I would pay a little more at a store next time."
2,This product is not like the others,"This product is not like the twin sized toppers that I purchased for my kids. My kids love theirs so much that I bought one for my queen size bed only this item is slightly smaller than my bed. Even though it is listed that is is customary for the topper to be slightly smaller is it unsightly and very noticeable. In addition, the topper slides off the bed while you sleep and no I do not have plastic on my bed. My husband complains all the time but because my body has becomed accustomed to it I cannot bear to part with it before getting a new one. The pillows are ok but not the greatest either. You get what you pay for. This xmas I want a new bed! Not this one."
1,"Cheap - will not last, caution on this one","Is not made well and the quality shows. If you have the money, buy a better on than this one."
2,don't fit,"the width was great, but the length was about 8 inches to short, so my pillow is going to be low or my feet will hang off. it would not be to bad and i would send it back, but i am in afghanistan and it takes to long to get here and the beds here suck, army buys cheap beds"
2,Not good memory foam,"I saw the reviews on this and decided to give it a try. I had a 2"" memory foam on our bed that I bought about 2 years ago. In comparison the old 2"" one is considerbly heavier than the new 3"". This is very cheap memory foam (the price and quality).This one is more like foam rubber. It is hard and not very confortable. We took it off this morning and put the old one back on.Tempur-pedic's density is 5.3lbs.I came up with about 3.05 lbs/cubic ft. for this pad. (Density = Weight / Volume = 13lb / 4.25 cu. ft. ).Go to Sams and buy a good one."
1,Memory?,"When you place your hand on it & take it away, it leaves no hand imprint for any amount of time. My neighbor is convinced this is not ""really"" memory foam, more like regular foam. (Are there different grades of density? I'm no memory foam expert.) For what it's worth to your purchase decision I am reviewing this on an old crappy mattress. We slept on it one week & our backs feel worse than without the enhancer. Unfortunately for me I purchased a queen size & cut it down to fit my full size bed properly (there were complaints that they make the toppers too small) so I can't return it. The pillows are also not for me."
3,Not Too Bad!,"Finding a decent priced Memory Foam Mattress out there is not only a journey but a price SHOCKER! My word this stuff is pricey EXPENSIVE! For the price you can't beat it! It arrived a little beat the heck up (THANKS UPS!!!) But otherwise its ok. If you are in the hunt for a NICE MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS GO FOR THE BRAND, QUALITY this stuff isn't up to par you know? The pillows are AWFUL and aren't comfy at ALL. The picture shown is NOT what you receive AT ALL. You get this YELLOW foam mattress and pillows.Its working for NOW but we will def INVEST in the real deal! If you are looking for an inexpensive quick fix this could be it... but not long term!"
3,sleep well,"good price on a combo deal. mattress pads are great, pillows are below par for a final rating of good."
5,Mattress Topper,I would like to buy one of these for every person I know that has trouble with any pain during sleep. I have had it for 2 nights and my hip pain is GONE. My husband says that I lay still all night long.
2,Not made to last,"I purchased this item on May 10, 2010. At first my husband slept comfortably and was glad we had made this purchase. By mid-November of last year the topper was less comfortable and the imprint of his body in the center was obvious. We turned the topper head to foot and front to back. It is now February and the topper is not comfortable; doesn't support anything. It is a big disappointment. I would recommend this to no one."
2,You get what you pay for,"This memory foam is very thick, but not as dense as I would like. For the price, its a decent buy with the two pillows but I intend to replace it soon with a denser model. A 1"" of higher-quality foam would be more effective than 3"" of this foam which is a bit too soft, squishy and prone to flattened spots. The pillows need often turning and I've already had to adjust the mattress once and I've only had it 2 months. You can't beat the price but you can beat the quality."
4,Would give it a 5 if it was a little bigger- worth the money,"This pad is soft and thick enough to make a real difference in comfort. We have a queen size, and the pad is too short on the sides by about an inch or two on each side. It takes a couple of weeks to really get comfortable and soft. At first I almost thought it was too tall, but after about a month, it is just right. I never toss and turn anymore, even waking up in exactly the same position as when I fell asleep on more than one occasion, which is a miracle for me, because I was a very restless sleeper."
3,Meh.,"It's soft, sure, but is hot as hell, and still retains that plastic smell a tad. The free pillows are less than useful - I wish there had been a way to opt out of getting them. Had I bought it for under $50, it would probably be a deal, but at eighty (now over one hundred!), it's not that great."
3,Is ok...,"I misread this and thought it was THE ""Memory Foam"". It works pretty well and is not as heavy as our double sized Memory Foam pad, but is not the same. Also the pillows are cheap foam pillows and do nothing to support my neck. They are not like the one Memory Foam pillow we have and still share. :) Overall a good product, just not as good as the Memory Foam."
4,"Comfortable, functional -- great add-on for the bed.","I had been experiencing backpain from my old mattress (and the very old ""eggcrate"" foam pad that was definitely past its prime), so I thought I'd try out this pad.I slept on a memory foam mattress recently, and this is definitely not the same experience. However, for a fraction of the price, this is a great bed accessory. I am experiencing less back pain, and just enjoying a more luxe sleeping experience, as I do feel somewhat cushioned in a focused, body-conforming way (tho, again, not nearly the same as with a whole memory foam mattress). Also, the pillows are a nice touch, and they've provided some nice neck relief and support.Although the pad is comfortable to sleep on, I've found that I appreciate it best for sitting up in bed for reading or watching TV. It makes a good sleeping surface, but an even better sitting foundation. Definitely worth the investment if you want to revitalize your past-due bed set-up for a lot more comfort."
1,Memory foam???,"Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered."
3,"Comfortable, but not the correct size",The matress topper made the bed much more comfortable and I can no longer feel the pressure points from the matress springs. The pillow that came with the set was not very comfortable however. My main problem is that the product I recieved was the length for a Twin bed depite the box's tag listing it as Twin XL.
5,Best thing for a Deployed Soldier,"This mattress is great! I've been deployed now for 7 months and finally was able to get a Mattress Pad for my bunk. This is the best thing since sliced bread. I've slept better in the past 2 week than the first half of my deployment! The 3"" mattress pad is just enough to give me support and keep my old spring filled mattress from stabbing me in the back. I love this mattress pad!"
1,Not what I thought,Just received my mattress pad and pillow. First of all it smells horrible and secondly it only came with ONE pillow that was gray not white and not the same material as the pad. I haven't used it but it has been sitting out for over 3 hours and hasn't taken shape yet AND IT ISN'T A TWIN XL. IT IS ONLY 72 INCHES LONG AND THAT ISN'T EXTRA LONG. I'M VERY UPSET.
4,Great for the price,"I've had my eye on a tempur pedic for years. Being a 23 year old with Fibromyalgia, sleep is very important in maintaining my strength during the day and although you can't put a price on health...A 23 year old wife and mother sure can! I did splurge on the tempurpedic pillows. I've had mine for almost 7 years and I'm just now wanting a bigger size. Needless to say, we didn't use the pillows that came with this mattress topper. I wasn't a fan of how dramatic the shape was or how it felt. My husband and I are both relatively small people, so for someone with a larger frame the pillow might not be so over the top. I watched the price of the mattress pad and got it for 80 dollars. I'm not sure I would've paid over 100 for it, but I'm cheap! It made our unbearably hard mattress great to sleep on and all in all was worth every penny I spent on it."
3,Not bad,The pad is soft but more spongy then my other one so flattens out faster. I love the pillow for an under-the-legs use.
5,Bliss,This product had many positive reviews when I decided to purchase it. I agree with everything good that has already been said. We sleep like babies. Love it!
2,not recommended,"Very disappointed in this item. barely two inches thick, it was suppose to be three. this pad is marginally better than a standard egg crate foam mattress pad. not really memory foam at all. the pillow looks like someone used a turkey slicer to cut it off the production line, and virtually no contour to it at all. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Total crap,"Not memory foam, at least not the density necessary to be of any use on a bed. The pillow is about 8 steps beneath a joke. I ordered twin XL and it is not the same dimensions as a standard twin XL. It is two inches too narrow and three inches too short. 37x78"" (the product on this page) vs 39x80""(standard). Also the under penalty of law tag isn't attached to the foam. It's attached to saran wrap around the foam which I had to remove in order to find out that the product was worthless. :( Really disappointed DO NOT BUY. I hope I will be able to return it."
1,NEVER RECEIVED PILLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The mattress pad is great, however, it was advertised w/ 2 foam pillows....which I still haven't received!!!!!!!!"
1,Very dispointed,This company is cheating..... I have receive the order but without the two pillows!!!!! this is NOT what they have said on the web....
4,See this film,"I bought this movie without knowing too much about it because of Dee Dee Ramone and Richard Hell. I enjoyed the movie immensely. In a nutshell, a young woman winds up homeless after the aunt she lives with dies and her creepy landlord expects her to pay the rent in sexual favors. Indignant, she winds up homeless, where she hooks up with a lovable yet dimwitted partner in crime. Together they help each other survive and fall in love along the way. They meet Dee Dee Ramone, a spaced-out Vietnam vet, Richard Hell, a Good Samaritan, and Nick Zedd, a hilariously angry young man who takes our heroine in for a bit and winds up stealing the movie. I won't spoil the ending but it's well worth seeing."
3,not bad for low budget indi film,"If you bear in mind that this is a low budget independent film, it's enjoyable. It's gritty, seeing nyc's lower east side before gentrification is pretty cool, many of the scenes seem authentic, and some of the characters are very humorous. The plot is a little choppy, the now-dead punk icons (thunders, nolan, dee dee ramone) make cameo appearances in scenes that have little to do with the plot-- but it's good to see them. The scene with dee dee is actually so dee-dee, if you've ever seen an interview with dee dee. Richard Hell is the exception-- he has something of a role and for once plays a nice guy (in 'smithereens' and 'blank generation' he played not very sympathetic character roles). You also get to see Maryanne Bracken-- who plays main character ""Lisa""'s aunt (Bracken is Johnny Thunders' sister). And the film is short enough that the weaknesses don't become too detracting to the enjoyment of the film."
1,Please kill me!,"What About Me is fascinating as an historical footnote of the East Village music and/or drug scene of the 1970s.However, as for acting skills, Rachel Amodeo's monotone voice could call forth bats from Hates.The acting was so bad as to be comedicAs for screenplay? You've got to be kidding.. . ?The best part of the movie are all the cameo roles from ghosted musicians victims of drug overdoses.On a positive note, the social commentary on Tompkins Park was memorable.What About Me certainly ranks as a cult film, right up there with Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes . . ."
5,Real nice faucet,Faucet came as specified--sooner than I thought it would and looked as described---new! We purchased this to go with our Kohler Georges IV clawfoot tub faucet assembly and the finish matched exactly---as it should for this kind of money.
1,Slime 300 psi BROKE AT 59 PSI,"I bought this product at a truck stop this summer for emergency inflation of 5th wheel tires and for my truck. The max I would need would be 80 psi. but when I tried to top off my spare starting at 30 psi up to a respectable 65 psi, the compressor sputtered, smoked and stopped at 59 psi. IF 300 psi influences you in any way to by this product, stop now and build your own. I could do a better job my self with a foot pump. If anyone finds a reliable 12v tire air compressor or horn air compressor and it is made in the USA, let me know."
5,TIRE INFLATOR,I had a chance to use this almost immediately after I got it. I came out from church and had a flat tire. I opened the inflator and read the directions and was able to pump my tire back up and make it to a place where I could get it repaired. It worked great!
1,Rubbish So Far?,"OK, bought for a motorcycle. So I have sent one unit back an await another. The hose pipe is flimsy for sure and the chuck is total crap. I wanted to add 2psi to a tyre that was sitting at 32psi. By the time I was done I was at 20psi and ended up going to the gas station. The chick did not stay on, it flew off when air came rushing out the tyre. The chuck gets stuck too and is made of some seriously crap metal. I am figuring the replacement is going back as well. You want a real bike pump? They cost 100 bucks...go search for it.Edit...The replacement showed up in a day, gotta love Amazon. Too bad the pump is crap. I'm not sure what all the good reviews are or if the manufacturing changed, but this one is cheap and crappy. No way the chuck will hold up.A pump is 100 bucks for a reason and not 30.Check out CyclePump"
3,so so,"well, looks very nice, but there is NO gage to tell you when tires are full. You just have to guess, or take out a whatever that thing is to measure the pressure. I kept it, but not wild about it. It is nice an small, I will say that about it."
1,Doesn't inflate much,Had this unit for about an hour (before I returned it)....took 5 minutes to put 4psi in one tire and the unit was dangerously hot during that process.It would not be possible to use this unit to fully inflate a single tire before the excessive heat shuts the unit off.
4,weak but reliable,"the good:i've owned this kit believe it or not, for over 5 years, used to put air into over 50+ tires. i never expected this to last so long, i've never did any maintenance or troubleshooting for any issues on this either. it looks cheap but keeps on trucking....the bad:it is weak. inflating my tires from 25 psi to 35 psi would take over 5 minutes. it heats up very quickly, especially around the connections. be careful when you are done with it, let it cool off. also instruction says to let it cool between heavy usage. also its very loud."
5,UFFF THAT'S WHAT I NEED,"Really i think for the pictures that this one could be larger, but i'm very impressed with it's size and it's capabilities. This is what every rider must have in the bag."
2,Extremely slow to inflate - received replacement,"I purchased Slime Power Sport Inflator in the Spring. Tried it to be sure it was working, but did not need much air at the time so did not test at length. About six weeks ago, a low tire pressure light came on in car, so I checked air pressure which was about 5 psi low in all tires, and used inflator. Took 2-3 minutes to boost pressure just 1 pound. Called Slime and was told that could happen, because the higher the pressure in the tire, the more resistance to the inflator, which they told me is not that powerful. I called a week later, was told that that rate was too slow, unit was probably defective so they agreed to send replacement at no cost. Just received yesterday so have not yet used. But if rate is too slow, your unit could be defective. If new one works at fasterrate, then it is worth it. If still too slow, it is not."
2,It works BUT ...(don't buy),"The Slime motorcycle tire inflator is a bare-bones minimal pump, lacking a crucial piece - the display gauge. Imagine spending so much and getting a pump shipped to you without a gauge. I need to use some other gauge to check the pressure. Also it inflates ok under 25 PSI or maybe 30 PSI, but after that I just can't get it upto 35 PSI - takes forever for higher PSI inflation. Should rate it a 1 really - guess I'm giving it a rating of 2 just because I bought it and don't want to feel too bad that I've wasted money on it."
5,"What a wonderful, tiny compressor! AAA+++","OK- I have a 1981 CX500C motorcycle and its a real hassle to get to the tires to add air. I succeeded in draining down to 20 PSIG of air in the rear tire on my bike- I HAD to get air into it. This compressor came in, I attached it, ran it by counting to 120 seconds slowly and it got exactly 42 PSIG- which is what the tire had stamped on its side. Very happy with it, would definately purchase again! A+ A+ A+ =)Oh, then I also got a valve stem get and a tire plug kit too- I hate the idea of being stuck having to call AAA for a flat tire :("
5,"Carman sets ""The Standard"" for the Contemporary Christian!","This CD is a must have for your Christian contemporary collection. It features different music styles making this a must have. Containing music with a joyful beat such as ""Now's the time"" To marchin"" and movin"" which makes you want to grab your combat boots -- to the stirring of every patriotic heart with ""America Again"". From music with a caribbean beat to a classic 50's type or rock n roll and more mellow music with plenty of harmony this has it all. This is personally one of my favorites."
2,This guy won a Dove Award for best hip-hop performance?,"I listened to ""Who's In the House"" once. They key word here is ""once""."
1,Madonna meets Adolf Hitler,"Anybody who's seen Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"" will immediately see parallels to Carman.Riefenstahl's documentary of the 1934 Nuremburg rally will set the stage for Carman's multimedia concerts, replete with evoking mass hysteria in the crowds.Carman's borrowing of the ""Maddonna Truth or Dare"" headset mike is the only new thing added.Songs like ""America Again"" are simply paens to religious bigotry.Luckily, this dreck is on the decline now."
5,Blacck & Decker steamer,I have had 2 B&D steamers in the past - gave one to my mother to encourage them to steam veggies and she decided she loved it. Recently gave my second one to my Dad and his wife as my Dad was discovered to have diabetes and encouraged them to use it and they love all the variations of cooking that can be done with a steamer - so ordered a new one for me. I'm a little bit discontented with the quality and desig of this B&D steamer compared to my 2 older models. It steams well and the oval shape is more user friendly- but if you are going to add any extra water to it through the spout on the side for that purpose - you must first lift off the very hot top part which is not a safe operation and empty the catch basin part because if you don't it will run over with the addition of the extra water steaming off! I wish they still made the older round model and am glad that I gave those to the folks I was encouraging to use a steamer because they are sturdier and easier to use.
4,perfect veggies!,"Many pros to this highly functional steamer. Vegetables are cooked to perfection enhancing their flavor & vitamin content. One drawback! If you aren't careful removing the cover it is easy to get a severe steam burn. If I was the designer I would have extended the handles on each side to procure a better grip! Otherwise, we are in love with it!"
1,Black $ decker HS1000,"The steamer was exactly what I wanted, however I had to return it as the lid did not fit. I was extremely disappointed. The item should have been checked before it was sent out. I did not bother to order it again too much bother for that disappointmentDianne Gilmour"
2,The basket cracked easily,"I love steamer but with other brands. I had this model for a year, one of the baskets broke after 6 months, and the other one won't last long, its cracking. I think they need to consider redesign the basket for long lasting durability. Otherwise, I won't come back."
4,perfect rice every time,"I've had this rice cooker / veggie steamer for several years now and have been getting perfect results every time. Although I've never used it for veggies - or for anything other than rice - the setup is simple and the outcome predictable. I only wish it took less storage space and had an option for cooking a larger amount of rice, since the default amount is excellent for 6 people as a side dish or for 3 or 4 as part of a main dish. Also, due to a strong preference for unflavored rice I've never used the Flavor Scenter Screen, but judiciously adding favorite herbs or spices to veggies or rice definitely could enhance the outcome. Highly recommended!"
1,Worst Steamer ever,"BEWARE. The steamer sucks. Timer times in 3 minutes segments vs the ""5"" on the dial so obviously timer doesn't give the correct time for cooking veggies. Lid comes warped and doesn't ""fit""or lock into top or seal steamer. Tray for large steaming bowl doesn't fit snugly on smaller bowl.And why would you want a scenter for veggies?"
4,Great little steamer,I bought this to replace a worn out steamer that was similar but larger. This time of year the main use is steaming asparagus which it does a great job of. The filling spout is unhandy. I just fill directly and then add any additional through the spout or through the screned area in the cover. This steamer is hard to beat for the price.
2,Cheap and flimsy,I love this product and have used the Black and Decker steamer almost on a daily basis for the last 15 years. This would be my fourth one over that time period. I ordered this when my last one stopped working. This product does not compare AT ALL to the prior versions. The clear plastic bin is very thin and flimsy. There is no longer a fill line inside and the new method for putting water in does not work. Half the time I end up spilling water all over the counter. I am expecting this to be broken within the next 6 months where the prior models lasted me over 5 years each. I am sad to said it is time to find another brand.
3,B&D Steamer,"Black & Decker HS1000 Handy Steamer with Flavor Scenter ScreenExcellent Steamer !!! It was bigger than the one I used before (8 Years ago). (That's how long the old one lasted.) This one is large family size, but can be used for smaller families. It works great to steam veggies, etc. Will cook most things in about 20 to 30 minutes. Put in Frozen beans (or anything) and in about 20 minutes they are ready to serve. Better than water on top of the stove. THE OLD SAYING: ""Try It, You'll Like It"" Applies ! ! ! !"
1,A poor example of a Black & Decker product.,Made with cheap materials. Not nearly as well constructed as one I bought several years ago. Hope this one holds up and reviews I read are not accurate.
1,Whaaaaat? $200!!! ???? Why?,"We've been using this steamer for a few years now, mostly for vegetables. I dropped the bowl section and it cracked, so we're looking to buy a new one. But NOT for $200!!!"
1,Do not buy this product: Black & Decker HS 1000 Handy Steamer,"I bought the Black & Decker brand because the previous steamer I owned was great! Lasted 3 years before I replaced it with this new one. The new one (referenced above) is terrible. In less than 2 months the center heating component started peeling. Personally, I strongly believe that's a health hazard. I will write to Black & Decker in hopes to get my $$ back."
3,Stopped working after 9 months,"I have used this steamer at least twice a week since purchasing in March 2011. I love it for steaming vegetables and making hard boiled eggs. I already own a rice cooker, so I haven't used that feature. Unfortunately, the heating element stopped working last night after only 9 months of use. I am very dissapointed in the quality of this product. My next steamer will not be a Black & Decker."
4,Perfect Steamed Veggies,"We purchased this steamer to replace one we've had for years. The old one finally gave up. It's a great appliance to have; no worries about over cooked vegetables, simple to use and easy to clean. My only concern was that the basket is a little flimsy and not as sturdy feeling as my old basket. Other than that, we got a great product for the price we paid."
3,Some disappointment since last model,"I agree with the other customer who said the clear basket on this model is a lot flimsier than our previous model. It really looks like it could break very easily. Also, the reservoir seems to hold less water, so when we cook something that requires a long time, e.g., brown rice, we cannot just put in the water once and leave it; we have to replenish when it runs low. Yet the more elongated design (our old model was circular) means it takes up more room on the counter and in the cabinet. So...not thrilled with this model, but it's doing the job so far. It still beats stove cooking rice or vegetables, no question."
3,Be carefull you can get burned,The mouth on the right hand side that you use to add water will have steam coming out of it. Plus the inside tray has no handles to pick it up like other models of this brand. Poorly designed.
4,good steamer,"we had a version of this that was about 13 years old. it lasted a long time and finally it began dying on us. i was glad to see that they're still making this guy. we use it mostly for rice, but we like that it's oval shaped so you can steam asparagus and other longish vegetables. if you need to make a lot of rice, this is not the steamer for you. you can't really make more than 1 1/2 cups (before cooking) rice. with the old one, you could do 2 cups. i imagine there's a better steamer out there, but the price is right on this one and if it's even half as reliable as its predecessor, i will have gotten my money's worth."
4,Soooooooo easy to use and very versitlle,"I've cooked rice, quinoa, hardboiled eggs and steamed vegetables and everything has come out perfectly. I had a similar rice cooker that lasted for over 20 years. It's such a simple mechanism that nothing can really go wrong.My only wish is that the inside bowl was larger. This is really suited to small portion cooking - not a bad thing all in all."
3,takes longer to steam than earlier models,"I bought this as a replacement for a 15 year old model that I loved. Unfortunately one day I turned it on without having put water in it first, and I must have fried it a bit because after that it took a long time for the water to start boiling. So I decided to replace it with this model. This one is no better than the broken one I was replacing. The old one said brocolli took 8 minutes, this one says 16, and my daughter says they're still raw. Also the basket seems to be in 2 parts, it's thin and flimsy. Unfortunately you can't get the older ones any more. I guess it's ok if you have nothing else to compare it to, but I'm unhappy. Maybe I'll donate this and keep using my old one."
5,like it. use it. good value.,we just started a new diet and this makes cooking vegetables more consistent. they always turn out just right. i'm not a big chef and i like that this is easy to use and clean.
4,great little rice steamer,"I had previously owned a Black & Decker Rice steamer-loved it & used it all the time. After amost 11 yrs it died.When I saw this one on Amazon it looked so much like my old one, I ordered it. This one works great too. Only complaint is they made the rice container smaller so it doesn't make as much as the old one did. This one makes 1 1/2 cups of rice unlike the one I had which easily could make 2 cups."
2,flimsy basket,"The steamer is Ok - but I think the basket could be improved - it is of very weak, and seemingly cheap plastic - it is not even fully attached at the bottom - just a few 'tags' to attach the bottom. I think it might break soon - my last one did - you cannot replace the basket, you have to buy a whole new steamer. The plastic is the kind that discolors and attracts oil etc - hard to keep clean. It just seems like there should be a better plastic out there."
2,I'm Looking for a MIracle!,"I absolutely love the Clark Sisters, I don't however love this recording. I bought the c.d for ""Simply Yes"", and I guess I should be happy for that, because these songs are totally locked into a 90's sort of time-warped, new jack R&B sound, unlike the classic sounds, of most of their previous recordings. ""Amazing Grace"" is done nicely, and so is the Dorinda Clark-Cole led ""Jesus is the best thing"". The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because it's the Clark Sisters, and when it's all said and done, they are some of the most talented, blessed, and annointed women I've ever seen or heard, they'll still remain that in my eyes, even with the lackluster production of this c.d Where in the world is Twinkie?"
2,Not Clarky!!!!! But I'm grateful for another effort to add to the collection.,"This effort was produced BeBe Winans.....and you could tell Twinkie wasn't anywhere around....she wasn't sitting in the corner....she wasn't standing close to the mic...she wasn't even in the room... We've already suffered the lost of Denise Clark, Mattie Moss-Clark, and now Twinkie...the least BeBe could do with the lengends was not to experiment. These songs don't really embody the signiture style at all. DLawrence also produced a couple of tracks...but I wasn't impressed with the work here....""Jesus is the Best Thing"" was great..... Amazing Grace was a little weird...but it is the Hymn of the Church. I would get this album only to have it in my collection...(where mine sits and doesn't move)...and it is at a low price....other than that....it's not a signiture Album......"
3,Dying to go to Tasmania,"There are rumors that the Tasmanian Tiger has been sighted on the Australian island of Tasmania. Nina, an Irish zoologist, believes that the mysterious tiger still exist. Her sister had came to the island looking for it. She had sent Nina a picture shortly before going missing. That was eight years ago and Nina and her group of friends go to the island to find the tiger, but then end up finding a group of cannibals.The first thirty minutes of the movie has slow pacing and I almost fell asleep because of it. Things start to get interesting when the Nina spots something outside in the bushes, then the blood and gore starts. Dying Breed reminds of the Wrong Turn movies, but only set in Australia. The acting is decent, but the plot is somewhat cliched. It's not the best horror movie, but it is better than some."
3,DYING BREED,"This movie was a welcomed surprise. This was definetely a horror flick. I would liken this to ""Deliverance"" on steroids. There was one very obnoxious character, however that this movie could've omitted. He was beyond over the top. Some viewers may have to have a strong stomach for some of the more gory scenes but it didn't bother me in the least. I'd say this is worth taking a chance on buying this one."
2,Nothing new,This is basically a concept redone before - group of people go to isolated town of inbred cannibals. Add to this the need to 'breed' with some of the incomers in case the bloodline is too intermixed and we still don't get anything new. It was done recently in The Hills Have Eyes 2The only differences here are the setting (in Tasmania) and the suggestion that an eight year old inbred girl is 'in heat' and is making herself available to be bred with. Fortunately (?) she's just interested in the end in feasting on human flesh
3,Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Tasmanian Edition,It led you to believe it was going to be a monster movie but it was really just a bunch of rednecks killing in the woods. Not bad but doesnt add anything original to the genre either.
4,Points you in the right direction,"Writing a book like this is always going to be a difficult task in an up and coming technology. This book handles it exceptionally well. Although being written in 2003 it manages to cover core web service security issues such as WS-Security, SAML and two options of identification softwre such as Liberty Alliance and the Microsoft .NET passport. For once it is refreshing to read a book that is concerned more with security for you and not trying to evangelise something down your neck. It introduces a good range of security issues that approach different aspects of web services security. This was a great start for me to start learning about web services security and the approaches to implementing it. So its a must read for any beginner in the subject."
4,Very complete,"This is a very complete reference in that it covers all the current standards that directly and indirectly impact web services security. I really appreciated the examples of how I would go about implementing various features. In that respect, it is a valuable reference for both architects desiring to design a secure web services solution as well as to developers who must implement the solution."
2,Not worth the price,"I would give this 3 stars if the price were around $[...], because that's about what these were worth. Very time-consuming to fill up all the little dumbell chambers; the dumbells themselves were a little awkward to use since the weight is distributed differently from regular dumbells and these are also bulkier.It's a great idea, and could be helpful if you're travelling to one place and staying there for a while, but it's too much trouble to empty and refill them if you're moving from place to place. Just do keep in mind that they're not going to match your regular workout."
2,Too bulky,It is a great idea to pack to take with you but these weights are way to big for a small girl like me. I would only suggest them to certain people.
3,Aquabells,1. So far no leaks2. Only can use 1 set of bells. 2 Sets and your hand cannot fit between them comfortably.3. Should be marketed to women only.
5,An Unconventional Thriller,"It's called ""bone pallace ballet"" so it's not a book of poems to read to your girlfriend under a willow tree at four in the afternoon, unless of course, she's got a wicked sense of humor. This book's hilarious, but chillingly realistic accounts of city life leave the reader dazed. It's like a high without the chemicals.He doesn't follow any modern patterns of poetry, but he reserves images for when they're necessary. We can only sense what he wants us to sense, when he wants us to feel it, see it, hear it, taste it. Bukowski takes you on a wild ride, leads you around, and in the end, you thank him for it.And if you're a writer out there, read ""The Word""! I haven't read it in a while, but I still remember certain lines, an image I could never have thought of, but he throws it in there, and it looks effortless like an acrobat, ""It can't hold your cigarette for you"" and then the rush of ""getting it down, getting it down, getting it down."" Read it, twice, you'll love it."
1,Scraps left behind.,This book is only a shadow of what Bukowski can do. I was very dissapointed with his wife being so hell bent on releasing his unpublished work. These poems are all ones that he would have never released had he been alive. They have no charm and show nothing of his talent. His wife I guess thought they were good enough to be released. I beg to differ. If you want a good collection of his poems from the last years of his life check out Betting on the muse which is an amazing book.
2,product never arrived then i was told it was on backorder,"well, i thought that the book was coming. when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder. they did let me get a refund which was nice. i would use them again for that reason alone."
4,Quilt History,"A gorgeous collection of quilts created for the World's Fair Contest sponsored by Sears. It shows the diverse backgrounds of some of the quilters involved, the scandal surrounding the winning quilt, and what happened to some of those quilts. It encouraged me to enter a contest with my first quilt."
1,Bankrupt customer sewrvice,I purchased this game one month ago. The spinner marker broke on the first use. I have tried repeatedly to contact Pressman customer service to get new part. They have promised 3 times to replace part but none has arrived. Poorly constructed and no help from company.
5,LMAO,"This right here, is definently for the Juggalos. Not many, non-Juggalos (or ""Fans"" of ICP or Psychopathic Records) are gonna like this, nor be able to watch thru it... Maybe Some Stoners, other than that, it's pure fun n comedy for those involved in that circle of life. Hate will be spread on Juggalos, no matter the forum. Just enjoy the random show.(Previously these were just internet video shorts....i wish more of Twiztids mini shows and segments were to be made into a Purple SHow vol. 2)"
3,Depends on what you like...,"I'm a HUGE Nicolay fan, but I like people with actual skills rhymin' over his beats, such as Little Brother. Don't get me wrong, alotta these cats have skills on this album (LB,Supastition,Living Legends,Common), I even liked Von Pea's joint on here. Overall though, if you don't have Foreign Exchange-Connected....PLEASE BUY THAT FIRST. You should hear an ALBUM by Nicolay with a real emcee (Phonte) before you buy this one. I'd hate for you to cop this album and say it was ...ok, and not have heard Connected...I think you'd get a better picture of this guy's prowess with the beats. My favorite joint on here hands down is the remix of ""All That You Are""...one of my favorite songs from Connected. Overall, you should get this album if you already own Connected, if not....GET CONNECTED FIRST."
5,hoping it works!,"as a family nurse practitioner, clinical hypnotist, and lifelong soldier in the ""battle of the bulge."" what drew me to this was the fact that nothing else works, so why not? I essentially gave up trying to lose weight several years ago, commiting myself to healthy eating, walking and enjoying life. over the next 4 years I lose over 60#. ironically, once I started ""trying"" to lose weight, I stopped. I see patients every day in my clinic who struggle with their weight. I've used medications and seen many go to surgery. sometimes this steps work, but often not. It's hard to get people to believe that just because they want to be thin and see themselves as thin that will be all it takes.time will tell."
3,Inspiring with lots of food for thought!,"It does seem pricey for what you get, however, this video has given me new ways to look at and approach weight loss. That's why it has earned 3 stars. The jury is still out...I'll see how it works over time, and update my comments and rating accordingly.I believe that the video needs to be viewed over and over again to be effective, and supplemented with follow up at the various speakers' websites to reinforce the concepts. I am disappointed that I have not been able to download the dvd to itunes so that I can view it on my iTouch. If anyone has any ideas on how I can do this, I would like to have your comments."
4,Wonderful DVD.,This was a great purchase and I believe in every word that was said. I don't know that I will want to watch it over and over again..... but it was good.
2,What am i missing,I did not gain any viable knowledge about weight loss and green tea.Vague and redundant.
5,Cool Software,Easy to use - easy to install - easy to manage - One of the few software products I have worked with that allowed me to back up multiple systems across multiple platforms to one media - and restore that information. If all software were this easy to use everybody would be doing it!!
1,Not Happie,"At this time I have nothing nice to say at all about Amazon.Maybe its not there problem but I never got the CD that I bought why I dont no nor do I understand because I but all my information in like it should have been and I never got it even though it was said to have been deliverd to me I never recieved it and could not get refund because it was deliverd but not to me.I wish the next person the best, but for me it was not a good thing. I cant rate this item because I never got it but Ive had this CD once befor and its beautiful I only wish I had got what I payed for."
4,"A Gentle and Easy Read, Excellent for Relaxing.","I've read a lot of travel essays and anthologies, and this was a fairly good one. In this collection, authors remember various places; their childhood home towns, their favorite rooms in the public library, grandma's back porch. The reminisces are sentimental, and that's fine, because thats what fond memories are. Its an easy book to read, and good for relaxing between more challenging literature.If you prefer something with a bit more meat to it, however, the ""Best Travel Writing"" series may be more your to your liking."
1,Knock-off,"The item pictured - a Purdy brush - is actually a very good product. Every Purdy brush I've ever owned performs well and holds up well through several uses and proper cleanings. But if you think that's what you're going to get when you order the above-pictured brush from APIAMERICA, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. You'll get a brush with no Purdy logo on the handle, a brush that has a soft-wood handle with a clear coat of finish and a red-colored tip (Purdy brush handles are unfinished hardwood, with the Purdy logo on them), and a brush that can't be used more than once. In other words it's a dressed-up version of the disposable brushes you can buy for a couple of dollars in any paint store. Lesson learned? If I want a Purdy brush, I should buy it from Purdy, a Purdy-authorized distributor, or from Amazon, not just on Amazon's site."
3,"Pretty good brush, but not great","I was told by a worker at a home improvement center that this brush is the best, and would avoid brush strokes. I tried it and wasn't too thrilled with it. The handle is raw unfinished wood, and the bristles were not fastened very well. I imagine that with natural bristles it would be expected to shed some, but I had to pluck off several bristles off my freshly painted cabinets. Their synthetic brushes for all paint types are quite nice, but this one for oil-based paints just isn't worth the money. I bought aWooster white bristle brushto finish the job and it worked a lot better."
4,GOOD PACING AND PLOT,"Shadow of a Doubt was well written with believable characters and circumstances. The main character, Kali, was a fully-formed human being. I'm old enough to remember the days before cell phones, so I found it fun to reminisce. I also thought that the relationships were authentic and the dialog natural. I liked this book and will probably want to read more from this author."
4,Shadow of Doubt,"Really liked this book, very interesting how real this could be. good writer.Page turner, shows things aren't always w3hat they seem.LOVE THE AMAZON FREE BOOKS, THANK YOU."
3,one superhit wonder?,"While Tucker is selectively remembered for his widely covered title track, there are 4 or 5 more toe tappers here that make this collection a fun listen. It gets me from A to B but it won't be the album I take to the Desert Island."
3,Starts strong but runs out of steam,"The author deserves kudos for creating a main character who is not the usual ex-Special Forces guy with a broken heart/shady past. He also has a good ear for British English; there are however way too many scenes of people standing around desks glaring at each other. And the last third of the book devolves into a Clancyesque shoot-em-up against impossible odds. Without giving anything away, Chace's exploits while in Cairo are particularly preposterous."
4,A Gentleman's Game: A Queen & Country Novel,Simply brilliant. My only complaint is that the novel would have profited from an expansion which focused on the planning and logistics of the operations involved. I avidly look forward to the sequel.
4,Couldn't get away from it,"This book is very good with balancing the technical, personal, and historical development of the US spy satelite program. I read it straight through in about 3 days. I only say very good because sometimes there was more details about the personal lives on the characters than I wanted; however, I tend to lean toward getting excited about the technical aspects of this topic."
5,The things I didn't know about espionage!,"This is a really interesting book, especially for cold war history buffs. The author is a NYTimes reporter who has taken a bunch of material that used to be classified, and stitched together an amazing portrait of cold war espionage. Did you know the earliest U-2 planes could see stripes in a parking lot from 70,000 feet? I didn't. There is plently of political history, and Mr. Taubman does a good job of explaining Eisenhower's motives for various things he did at that time, especially things that didn't seem obvious from the unclassified information available."
2,"Sturdy product, but not enough traction","I desperately need a 'lap desk' for my macbook and unfortunately this product does not make the grade. It is pretty sturdy it seems, but for my macbook the Cushtop's smooth covering material and lack of a 'lip' mean that if it is held at even a slight angle, the laptop quickly slides forward. It is also a bit too high for comfort when working in my armchair. It seems ok if I am sitting completely upright, but I like to kick my feet up! I am sending this one back and will order an iLap. I've heard nothing but good things about those from other mac users."
4,Not bad at all,"Bought for my wife who really wanted a ""laptop stand"" but uses it on her legs in the bed also, so I thought this would help with the heat and discomfort. It does. Good product in my opinion for the price. Now I need one that stands like a tray or table."
4,Awesome accesory,"I love it. It was what I was looking for, namely, a confortable holder for my laptop. While I have my MacBook Pro protected by aSpeck Products MB15-CLR-SEE-V2 15-Inch See Thru Hard Case for Macbook Pro (Clear)if I hold it to inclinated the computer slowly slides. But, it is easy to prevent this and I don't consider it a problem. The inner pocket just below the computer is very useful to hold a small external HD that I use to store my music. While it is true that if you use your computer for heavy duty stuff (in my case, compiling software or compressing video) the computer might turn on the fans this cushion protects you from the heat. I recommend it."
3,made me break out with a rash after using it,"seriously, it did. hopefully this won't happen to many others.even if I wear a sweat shirt or put additional clothing below the cushtop to protect my skin, I still get a splotchy rash from the material of this product. Once I stopped using this product, rash went away."
5,Anti terge,Best product on the market for extreme dry skin. I work in construction and my hands crack and bleed from working around concrete. This is the ONLY product that heals and protects and I've tried everything on the market.
4,The Caxley Chronicles,"Follows two merchant families in Caxley, a thriving market town near Fairacre. As usual, Miss Read describes their ups and downs in vivid detail, allowing us to commisserate and rejoice with them. The reader gets a glimpse of small-town life in an England that no longer exists, and we are the poorer for its demise."
2,Spaceghetti Men,"Niche market DVD purveyor RCF's dubs are ""best available source,"" with quality that varies from only fair to very good..While everyone was (presumably) asleep at 5 am Sunday morning, I was watching a stinkfest of the first order!ASSIGNMENT: OUTER SPACE (aka ""Space Men"") (1960) has all the earmarks of a bad sci-fier--1.) A ""name"" actor trapped in a bad movie, in this case, Rik Van Nutter, who had a supporting role in THUNDERBALL (1966).2.) Made in Italy3.) Crappiest special effects that include toy rocket ships4.) Sleep-inducing story5.) Lousy voice-over actors for the American version6.) Cheapest of setsGet this plot:When a ship called Alpha 2 enters our solar system, there's concern that its overheated photon engines will destroy Planet Earth. :?oThat must be one big-ss motor! Probably made by Lamborghini...."
2,Alpha Two does not answer,"A reporter on a routine mission in the 21st century. Finds he is wrapped up in a mystery that will take him from nervous intruder to a heroic mission. On the way reporter Ray Peterson (IZ41) and botanist, co-pilot and all around cutie Lucy (Y13) find time to fall in love.In the process George the Commander (David Montresor) learns to be human and give a few rousing speeches about how man carries his nature to space with himself. Al (X15) (Archie Savage) find an opportunity to sacrifice for man kind and be remembered ""Alas poor Al""Turns out that humanity itself is being threatened. Will this crew be able to get along and deter the threat or is destiny too strong?The mechanics to tell the story are the use of models, old pilot helpmates and Italian 1961 concept of space fatuous. The analog interments add that space feel.Flight to Mars"
3,"Great material, okay selection, atrocious title","I have the 4-CD box of France Gall on the Phillips label (1963-68 or maybe 1969), and if my house caught fire, I'd grab it before leaving.Having said that, you can do better for the money than this compilation. Good lord, there are enough others to choose from by now. It seems like they recycle these songs into a new package once a month. And some of my favorites are missing here: ""N'écoute pas les idoles"", ""Nous ne sommes pas des anges"". Well at least they omitted ""Sacré Charlemagne"", which is a big plus. I suppose the inclusion of several of her jazz numbers here is a lame atttempt to justify the AWFUL title of ""Lounge Legends"". Who comes up with this nonsense?"
1,"Really cheap, I mean really cheap","My son received this toy as a holiday gift to complement his recent starter Lionel O-gauge set. While the scene is attractive and would be a nice add-on, it is so poorly made that we threw it out. It says in the directions that no glue is necessary. Hah! There is no way this stands without glue. It amazes me that this toy could not have been slight re-designed so the pieces actually interlock and stand up on their own, as promised. This is truly an example of a poorly made toy that should not be considered by anyone. Bachamann should be ashamed to have their name associated with it."
3,Sun Ra,"The music and live concerts and recordings of Sun Ra, have but two words. OUT THERE!!!!!!! Sun Ra is a musical Genius. You have to be in a certain frame of mind to be able to enjoy this music. When you feel like you need a change of pace from the ordinary flow of life and music, pop in this Dvd and see where it takes you. I was fortuned enough to be able to see Sun Ra perform several times when I was younger, so I know what to expect. You will have fun with this one. Your friends might look at you kind of strange though."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"I was anxious to read this book considering that the author was once a lawyer for the Johnson family/business. He undoubtedly has much to tell from personal experience and I find no fault with that. However, his text becomes mired in details that would probably cause most readers to not finish the book. I do take issue with some of the liberties he took in determining the actions of those of whom he had no direct knowledge. The book did a good job of telling the Billy Sol Estes connection. Considering the extensive detail in much of the book, I found details to be sorely lacking in other areas such as the New Orleans and mob connections.The book leads the reader to believe that LBJ was solely responsible for the assassination. There is ample evidence today to show that there were many more factions at work in the deadly plot."
5,After All these Years--Finally the Answer!,"This book carefully traces the devious rise to power of LBJ and his contemptuous associates in shame. Only one person stood immovable between LBJ and the White House--John F. Kennedy.LBJ must have despised the popularity and progressiveness of JFK, and this book carefully chronicles the escalation of evil behind LBJ's rise to power.Blood, Power & Money is the most poignant book on the conspiracy to kill JFK. The fingerpring of LBJ's evil associate only definitively confirms what is laid out in the book.The silence, as to the salient facts of this book, from doubters is deafening.The ""readers,"" who attack the author, obviously cannot attack the truth and the clear chronlogy contained in this book.This book should be a must read for every history and political science class in America.We must never forget--the Truth sets us free and keeps us free!"
1,An opportunity missed,Strange book; it starts off promisingly but then moves from factual data to 'faction' and at that point becomes riddled with errors and unnecessary speculation. If McClellan had just stuck to the facts of what he knew this would have been a far more credible book.
3,LBJ took the IRT down to 1st street USA,"This guy really doesn't like LBJ. He is also a lawyer and writes like one: 1. the book could have been at least 1/3 shorter with an editor who actually edited, and 2. he is writing to persuade to his viewpoint. All that being said, the book is a compilation of really nasty suspicions, the basis for the suspicions in Texas history and politics and LBJ's history and politics, and a few facts consistent with those nasty suspicions. As a theory, it hangs together well."
1,Beyond horrible,"Barr McClellan fails as an author, an attorney, and a historian with his indictment of LBJ as the real killer of LBJ. Even he admits his book relies mostly on something he refers to as ""faction."" The book is practically unreadable in terms of style, and the ""evidence"" he offers would never be allowed in a court of law. His history is undocumented and unverifiable. His proof for LBJ's murder of Kennedy more often than not is a glance, or a look, or an unspoken admission, that apparently only McClellan can decode.Readers would be better off picking up Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream"" or they might even try the Warren Commission Report (available for ten bucks), which few conspiracy theorists have actually bothered to read and the major analysis of which has never been conclusively rebutted.Barr McClellan certainly hasn't with this forgettable piece of flotsam."
2,"Unfortunately, rambling nonsense... but interesting?","Listening to the Audible version, I want to yell, ""Get to the point!!"" McClellan seems to have a particular grudge against his ex-boss Clark, and it detracts from the credibility of everything he says. Were they lovers? He also seems to be trying very hard to stretch his limited facts out into a book-length story. The result is rambling nonesense. Maybe he really knows something, but it's hard to tell. It all keeps coming back to how evil his former boss is.Stop wasting my time, Barr. Perhaps your son Scott McClellan could evade the point for a living as the White House Press Secretary, but we are paying you to get to the point.Oh well. My fault for expecting more. Skip this garbage. Bush Sr. and Cheney did IT for their Swiss Bank owners. That's all you need to know. We're all doomed."
1,Naive and foolish conspiracy nuts,"It takes a special type of naveté for a fool to believe something as monumentally stupid as the claim that LBJ killed JFK. These dopes believe they have special insights into the realities of power that the rest of us lack. In truth, they are stunningly gullible. Don't bother reading this crap. If you just can't accept the idea that a loser like Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK, have some guts and read Bugliosi's ""Reclaiming History."" On the other hand, rubes who believe LBJ is a killer probably believe that Bugliosi is just another member of the conspiracy and will refuse to read him."
5,Outstanding Documentary,"One of the most detailed, well documented and well written documentaries regarding the JFK assassination I have read. I've been a long-time student of the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers and thought I knew most of the details of both. Blood, Money & Power, however, provided me with new revelations regarding the history and facts of the emergence of the Texas Mafia, the conspiracy at the heart of both assassinations. I found McClellan's book both compelling and fascinating. It's a major eye-opener that I hope every American voter reads...and heeds!"
5,cwwhitnel2,I have been a buff since I was 8 or 9 and the teacher wheeled in a TV to 5th grade so we could see and watch what had just happened to our President in Dallas. For the last 40 years I have suspected conspiracy. Oliver Stones' Movie was EXCELLENT but this book filled in the last piece of the puzzle. WELL WRITTEN and very easy to read.
2,Research Walt Brown,"If you are interested in this book take the time to read Walt Brown's November 1, 2003 recant of his recommendation found on the jacket of this book. It has some very interesting information. Since it's not fair to quote the entire statement a little bit of effort is required. This is easily found on the internet and is titled ""clarification."" Hint; search on Barr clarification ""Walt Brown""From Brown""s clarification, ""I cannot, in good conscience, castigate the Warren Commission's work, on one hand, and widely endorse a mistake-laden, ""factionalized"" account on the other. It would be hypocrisy, and despite my LBJ beliefs, I cannot do it.""By the way, I do agree with Brown's assessment that LBJ was involved in the assassination."
4,How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K and Started the Texas Republican Party,"If you struggle through the tumbleweed and rusted oil derricks in the first half of Barr's book, you will be rewarded with the most plausible answers to questions you have been asking for forty-three years. Whether you choose to believe, or not, there is no better answer and the proof is there when honest and unfearful authority is in place.More importantly, reading between the lines, this telling and forthright unburdening by Barr exposes the birthing of the Texas Republican party. It is obvious from reading this book that the dirty business and politics that is Texas tradition, the oil-garchy and modus operandi that put LBJ in Washington, is the SOP of today's GOP. If you get nothing else from this book, you must recognize LBJ as the Godfather of today's Republican party."
5,This Book Reminds Us Why We Are Americans--the Truth!,"This book carefully connects LBJ's continuing rise to power with ever heightened corruption. LBJ's 'henchmen' and other power hungry people must not be let off the hook. Years later, this book reveals what must be--which is why the silence in response to the facts presented in the book is deafening.Do not fear the naysayers and the continued attempts to coverup a horrible wrong from our past. We must face the truth to not allow such corruption to happen ever again."
5,I always knew Johnson did it!!,"This is a fast paced and very readable book. Although a lot of the evidence must be taken with a grain of salt, and the conclusions are speclative, this is one of the few books where the author was on the inside of the Johnson gang.Much of this book also deals with how Johnson moved up through the ranks, and what the texas party 'machine' was capable of."
4,The dark side of a demented man,McLellan convinces you that LBJ was a key player in the assisnation. He convinces you that LBJ did it because he had to do it or his empire would crumble. Lyndon Johnson was a monster. Once he ordered the killing of one government employee he had to keep going. The impact of the book is blunted by the fact that Johnson is dead. There is no one alive to prosecute. Neither is anyone alive who could sue McLellan for slander. The thin part of the book is a lack of accounting for what went on in Washington before the murder. I can accept LBJ as a kingpin in the plot but I have trouble accepting that Oswald was a actually Marxist fool.
2,Ugghhhh,"By the time I write this, the book seems to be tough to come by, but a warning nonetheless.Being forced to read it for a theory of religion class, I must warn that while it breaks down the categories of religion in an interesting fashion, it fails to build them back up into any sort of recognizable order... there's nothing to study, just anecdotes.The theistic v non-theistic thing is pretty irritating as well, as previously noted."
3,Those Who Hunt Elves,"Although I was dubious about buying this Anime I thouht I would take the chance after reading other peoples reviews about it. I have now Watched it through and found it at times about as subtle as a heard of wild elephants, but I would as say it is definitly worth a laugh at times.Stupid, silly even absurd but a good giggle none the less."
2,Time for some balance,"There are two very big minuses with this series:1. The animation is lame, with lots of still shots, even in the fight scenes2. The English dub is poor, and deviates quite a bit from the Japanese.The premise was great, and I wanted to love this series, but did not. It will be better for those who watch in the original Japanese."
5,Possibly the hardest I've laughed in years!,"This series (especially series one) is now runner-up for my favorite anime series. If you consider my favorite has stood since it came out in 1992, that's saying something. (Oh, All Purpose Cultural Cat-Girl Nuku-Nuku is my favorite, tied with the Nuku-Nuku TV sequel series). If you like the humor style anime this one is a must."
5,LoL. All I could say,Story about heroes running around stripping every elf they come across by. I bought this thinking that the whole story line was in it. Should've researched a bit more since I hate being left hanging.
2,The teacher needs to know french!,"It was with great anticipation that my daughters and I awaited this book and tape set. We couldn't wait to learn French! It was a great disappointment however, when we opened it up and found not a word of English. The teacher needs to know French in order to use this product as there is no English to use as a comparison. The pictures are not very good and the words go way too fast. I gave two stars becuase I imagine this set will be useful once we know French and need some review."
2,A some-what useful book,"Even though this is a first edition book, it can still be found in some colleges. (That's where mine came from) I am somewhat dissapointed at what this book offers:1. The verbs aren't in kanji or kanas. They are in romaji only (a variant system. i.e. si for shi, ti for chi etc.)2. It goes in alphabetical order, not Japanese kana order. This makes it quite confusing and frustrating for the more advanced student who's used to looking up Japanese words in a Japanese dictionary.3. The verb list (espcially in the back) aren't clear in some places. (i.e., there's 3 translations for ""to change"", but it doesn't say what each one is used for)4. The grammer definitions in the beginning of the book are also confusing, and doesn't give a clear sentence example.It still gives a good listing of verb conjugations, but that's about the only good point."
2,Other 2 star Reviewer said it best,I completely agree with the reviewer who gave this book a 2 star - I should have paid a little more and bought the updated version by Barron's - the updated version only has Kanji at the top of each page for the main word - but that is better than this one that has absolutely no Kanji (nor Kana) at all.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was so looking forward to this live concert - especially after reading that any DVD of Marvin Gaye was rare, and virtually non-existent.This was a disaster. It should never have been released without the sound engineers fixing it.He performed masterfully, from what I could see. He seemed full of confidence, and projected very well, but you could barely hear him. The background music all but completely drowned him out.I had to return my copy, thinking it was defective, and that the channels were reversed, as happens on occasion, but after reading the other comments, it seems that every copy was the same.There is really no excuse for this to ever happen. It's beyond quality control - it just smacks of total incompetence.Look at all the trouble people are put to, or some, who keep it, are stuck with such an inferior performance that thay can't possibly feel good about it."
3,Great Performance - Bad Sound Mix,Marvin Gaye and the Band give a great performance of a good mix of soul and funk.I hope the sound the audiance heard was better than the sound on this DVD. At first I had to check the setup on my system and I tried the DVD on another DVD player. In the first track Marvin was barely audible and was drowned out by the band. Even the back-up singers were louder. The balance improved a little but Marvin's singing never gets the prominence it should.Three stars is the average of five for performance and one for sound.
2,Disappointing,"I love watching and listening to concerts on DVD. The sound and picture quality from a good DVD are almost as good as seeing the concert live. A couple of great examples are ""Nora Jones-Live in New Orleans"" and ""James Taylor Live at the Beacon Theater.""I'm a fan of Marvin Gaye so when I saw that this DVD was available and that it was a DTS recording, I had to have it. Unfortunately, the picture quality is only mediocre and the sound quality is poor. It almost looks like someone simply transferred a VHS tape into DVD format. I can't recommend this DVD to anyone except the biggest of Marvin Gaye fans."
4,Too close to home.,"I use to work for Mike Deichmann at his GM dealership in New Bern. I knew he was heavily involved with Shelby, but this book is a true eye opener! If someone ever makes this book into a film, I vote Mr. Deichmann to play himself. Truth truly can be stranger than fiction!His favorite slogan: It's all about Attitude."
3,"I haver to agree with beckyboy, it ain't that bad","The story is somewhat enjoyable and the action is good if limited. I barely give it a 3 stars becasue the fight scenes are so cut up, it does kind of ruin the viewing experience. There is one brillianly shot scene in the rain that I thought was some of the best cinematography I have seen in a kugn fu movie in a while. The ending, while not the best, is still enjoyable.I got this as part of the brentwood 10 pack that came with lighting kung fu and fighting ace. It is called fists of fire or something. Picture quality is not too bad, full screened of course. But this is not exactly a collector's item."
4,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu","Prior to buying this flick, I noticed noone had reviewed it via Google or Amazon.com,,therefore, I purchased it with some reservations and immense hesitation. However, after viewing it in it's entirety, I am sufficiently satisfied that this is not a bad flick at all,,,the fight scenes were are well choreographed and the cinematography not bad. I'm safisfied with this purchased and have no regrets. I usually have reservations giving out the plot/ details of a flick,,,but I will make an exception with this one: Accordingly,,this flick is about a kid from a rich family, who is desperate to learn kung fu,,however, out of fear for this kid getting hurt, his father refused to have him lean the art of kung fu,,therefore,his father hired a top fighter to protect his son from other thugs who wishes to beat him up. This is a similar plot to the ""Prodigal Son',,with some difference,,,the story is also quite different."
4,Pre-Achaemenid Iranian bronze work,"Collectors of Iranian bronzes, especially readily available Luristan and Amlash production will appreciate this work as a basic reference work. Look also for P.R.S. (Roger) Moorey of the Ashmolean Museum for an additional reference. Identification of swords, daggers and axes for the collector is very useful and adds to the value of your collection. E-mail me at JPisc98357@aol.com for additional sources on early Iran."
4,Life on a vacation island,"I liked the description of life on an island that most visitors never know about. There are ordinary lives that summer visitors aren't aware of. How Faith discovers the secret sewn in the quilt makes an exciting read. As usual food plays an interesting part, too."
3,A Pleasant Cozy Mystery,"I've always found the Faith Fairchild series enjoyable and better than the average cozy. However, in ""The Body in the Kelp"" too much time is spent on incidental facts instead of working on the major plot points. This causes the solution to be a little disappointing-the motives for the crimes were murky and there were too many underdeveloped story threads.One other major flaw is the high number of typos, on almost every page it seemed. Shame on publisher Avon Twilight for letting this go through. I wish publishers would realize how unprofessional this is and how it spoils the enjoyment of reading the book.But, even though this book starts out more promising than it finishes up, there are some clever plot devices, including clues placed in a quilt pattern. That was fun to see solved, and there is enough of a story overall to satisfy the reader.If you enjoy the cozy mystery genre, this book is worth checking out."
2,useless,"I bought this for a class and never even opened it. It's so useless I don't even know where it went. Unless its a required text, don't bother."
3,No comment,I purchased this book for my son for college and had to return it unused as the teacher changed the text at the last minute.
5,The only brush I'll use.,"I'm a house-painter, and this is the only brand of brush that I'll use. If taken care of properly, a Purdy brush will last a life time.The angle on this brush lets you get into smaller nooks and crannies with ease, and makes cutting fast and effortless (with practice). This is an excellent all-around brush to have."
3,Wrong information,"By looking at your sales number on the Purdy paint brush I just bought I thought I was getting 2 brushes,when my order came it was only 1 brush which I could have got anywhere cheeper."
1,dollar store,"save money and go to dollar store and buy a hammer and beat your foot for a few minutes to get the same feeling you get as listening to these terrible recordings.And why do they interview these bands,I want music if I want a narrative I will read a bookby a great author of expert.I don't care what they think about poverty I want music. If you have to buy Hawthorne Heights or New Found Glory . Why can't Thrice put out a good concert dvd?"
1,Disappointed,I was disapointed with this DVD..the fish do not look real and the soundtrack and natural sounds are less than soothing!
4,I Loved It,"I bought this DVD simply because it sounded a bit interesting and, as it turns out, it was well worth the money. The opening and ending animations are gorgeous and the plot ranges from serious to very funny. After all, what could be more amusing than watching a god dress up in a giant anteater outfit to pay his rent?"
5,The best show since Case Closed,"This is a great show. I bought the edition with the collectors box and it was great, the collectors box is huge. This is a great show about Loki a Norse god sent down to earth in a childs body. It is a great show full of mystery and comedy like no other. And it is a good idea to spend the extra couple of bucks for the box because its worth it."
2,Boring.....may be OK for young children,"Maybe it was the English dubbing, but this show really turned me off. I am a fan of both detective and spiritual anime but this show did not measure up. I hated the English dubbed version of Sailor Moon, but loved the subbed version. So if I had a chance to see a subbed version of The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok I would give it a second chance."
5,Great Product,"Product is what I expected. Fits great, fully adjustable. Already paid for itself in saved clothes two weeks after recieving."
5,Feeling Sane Again!,This book was a life saver for me at a time when the Dr.'s were at a loss. The recipes are clear to follow and the ingredients are easy to get. Anyone who's needing to get their stomach back in control would appreciate this book.
2,Not For The Average Person,"While the general information was helpful, the recipes were too gourmet, not what your average person would ever prepare or eat. I wish she would come down to earth and write another book and include down-to-earth recipes."
3,"Will be helpful to IBS sufferers looking for ""safe"" recipes, but not so much for with other digestive disorders...","Good, informative book, and has some decent recipes!I've been battling IBS for the better part of 15 years and there are some good recipes in this book. Not a big fan of seafood, and there do seem to be a lot of seafood recipes in the book.I'm also battling GERD (acid reflux) and some of the recipes will not be friendly due to some of the spices used."
4,4.5 stars - A top rating for reducing IBS,"It is about 70% for attacks of IBS when it comes to food for me; however that 70% is reducing. This IBS cookbook was a blessed find and money well spent. The recipes range from 'everday' meals to fancy dishes when having company.Some recipes I have tried and absolutely melt for are:- Louisiana Barbecued 'Catfish' sandwiches. (I followed the recipe and used the sauce on Tuna filets. Not a catfish person - those are 2 animals that should not cross breed)- Jamaican Chicken with Ginger Peach Dressing (yum)- Gingerbread- Fettucine with Creamy Butternut Squash SauceThe recipes are neutral, for additional special needs. They call for Soy based products, which is an added bonus for milk allergy.The recipes are sometimes time consuming, but indeed, worth the effort. Having a guide with IBS friendly food allows for your own personal creativity."
3,Easier Recipes Needed,"Hello-I really enjoyed reading this book. Heather's personal story and advice for IBS suffers is useful (at least for me). Although she does lay out the basic nutritional information on fiber and other trigger foods. Her recipes are far too complicated, I'm a graduate student with very little time for cooking. So the recipes are just too time consuming. I need easier and faster recipes. Some of the breakfast ideas fit into my lifestyle, but the dinners are complicated, although they sound delicious. Perhaps someday I will have time to try them. If Heather (the author) is reading this, please write a recipe book with easier and faster IBS safe recipes. I'd definately buy it! Thanks!"
5,Eating for IBS,"This book can give hope to people suffering from IBS. It is full of useful tips and guidance for a pain-free life. The recipes are fantastic and it certainly helps that the author herself suffers from IBS. Since I've read it and have been following the strict diet, I have been a lot healthier and happier. It is better to follow a strict diet and be healthy than to think you're eating ""whatever you want"" and being sick all the time. Even though the IBS diet is strict, this book has converted many fabulous recipes with safe alternative ingredients-- the meals are safe and taste great too!"
5,New lease on life!!,"The information in this book has restored my health!! Not only do I feel better I have lost 13 lbs. in 5 weeks. This food program, plus the peppermint oil gel caps, allows my food intake to stay with me and I am benefiting nutritionally. I am so thankful that Heather Van Vorous shared this information. I haven't felt this well in three years!!"
2,At first glance,"At first glance, and judging from all the reviews, this book seemed like the answer to my problems. Upon opening it and reading, I felt like I was getting a huge 'YOU HAVE TO BECOME A VEGAN TO GET OVER THIS' message. Some of the claims behind certain foods having NO nutritional value and being linked to some diseases seemed like a stretch that I myself want to look into just to see if there's really any claim to it. I'm very skeptical about a lot of the claims.However, I have found that several foods in here are listed as trigger foods that I am prone to, and it's good to be aware of what not to eat, and when not to eat it. I can be more aware of it in the future, but I'm not sure I'm going to give this book another look after feeling like I'm being preached to about becoming a vegetarian."
1,DOESN'T DELIVER THE GOODS,"I decided to write this review when I ssw that another amateur reviewer had given this book 5 Stars and a different book about IBS only One Star. (I haven't read the other book yet, but I plan to order it today.) ""Eating for IBS"" promises a lot, but doesn't deliver. Though I will say this for it, the cover is stylish and appealing. In the first part of the book there is a great deal of information about IBS, but nothing one could not find elsewhere. The author's premise that artificial sweeteners contribute to the symptoms of IBS turned out to be totally without merit IN MY CASE. I can't speak for anyone else, maybe others would benefit from the elimination of artificial sweeteners from their diet. All that happened to me was that I gained weight! As for the recipes - many are complicated and call for esoteric ingredients not found in the average kitchen."
1,This book was not helpful in any way,I tried several of the diet suggestions from this book and my IBS only got worse. It was a complete waste of time and money and now I have just given the book away.
3,Excellent Diet Book/Root Cause,"Just read ""Eating for IBS"" and thought that Heather did an excellent job at providing dietary tips and eating healthy foods for dealing with this miserable and very frustrating condition. Its important to remember that ""IBS"" is just a catch-all phrase that the Drs. use when they can't find anything to explain your symptoms. This being the case, the cause can be anything!Maybe you shouldn't have meatloaf and a vanilla shake for breakfeast? Or maybe the ""Root Cause"" could be an overgrowth of Bacteria in your intestines?? Its been proven that many ""IBS Cases"" started after having a bad case of Food Poisoning. I would highly recommend Dr. Mark Pimentel's Book, ""A New IBS Solution"" This is the ONLY book that discusses bacteria overgrowth and how to diagnose and treat it! It might be the best investment you've ever made!"
4,Wonderful Resource,"This is the first book I bought when I was diagnosed with IBS several months ago. Though I would have liked to see more tips on nutrition and how to cope with IBS, the recipes are awesome! It is mainly a cookbook with a bit of nutritional/coping advice for sufferers of IBS. I have tried many of the recipes, even cooked them for my family and friends, and they have all been very flavorful and yummy. (And none of them have provoked any symptoms!) My only complaint is that they are quite gourmet which isn't always convenient when you just want something the equivalent of mac and cheese. Overall though, a great book."
5,Never felt better,"> I have never felt better in my life, since that day that I was> searching the aisles in the library and stumbled onto this book. I> have been to a dietician, doctors and so on you know the story. But> I have been following your program and now I feel great."
4,Great book to read for IBS.,"When I was first diagnosed with IBS my doctor recommended this book. I am so grateful that she did! I feel that it is the most comprehensive book on the market for eating for IBS. She does an excellent job of explaining the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber, which is a key to understanding how to eat for IBS. THe few recipes I've tried have been great. I was so inspired, that I started blogging about my daily diet experience (no weight gain either!). You can check out how I eat at [...]. This book really helped shape my diet. Thank you Heather!"
5,Wonderful book,There IS good food I can still have. Thank you Heather Van Vorous for writing this. Please write more.
1,NOT low-residue recipes,These recipes contained MANY items which are definitely NOT allowed in a low-residue diet. We were very disappointed and put the book on a shelf! It did not deliver what it promised.
2,OK as far as it goes,"But once you get pass the first 20 pages which do contain some useful information it is a cookbook which is fine for those who cook but some of us don't cook, some of us will never make Linguine with Creamy Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Sherry Sauce for instance. How about some more buying advice. What can I buy at the supermarket? Which fruits and vegetable are OK and which not so much. What can I order from a Chinese or eat at an Italian or Mid Eastern restaurant. And what about those of us who just pop frozen entrees into the Microwave. We could use some advice also."
3,Is not compatible with the low residual diet prescribed by my Doctor,It may well be an excellent cookbook for IBSI purchased this book after a web search on low-residual low cholesterol diet cook books.The recipes in this book may well comply with an IBS diet but they do not comply with the low-residual diet prescribed by my gastro. Far to many exceptions to that diet to be practical for my application.
3,book review,"I learned a lot from this book, that no doctor ever told me. I was dissapointed that the majority was recipes. It was not listed that way in the preview. Not sure I would have purchased had I realized that 3/4 of the book is recipes, mostly vegan."
5,Lots of useful information,It was purchased for my wife who is getting a lot from the book. I see her taking notes and using them like a college student studying for a test.
5,Such a good helpful book!,"I LOVED this book, I rented it from the library before buying it because I've bought a couple books in the past that weren't too good. I loved this book so much I had to buy it. The tips are so helpful, and the recipes are delicious! This book made me so relieved that I can actually eat tasy things instead of just bland foods. My suggestion is renting it from the library first, make sure you like it before buying even though you can buy it very cheap here on Amazon.CHECKOUT HEATHER'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL!- There are videos on some of the recipes in the book, and she mentioned she will be adding more videos soon. =)"
2,Not the Right Book for Me,"While this book some good content and receipts - it is outdated. The book was published in 2000 and more research has been done over the past 11 years. Most of the receipts have food that people with IBS should not eat; foods such as soy, onion, garlic and wheat products. These are trigger foods for most people with IBS. I recommend that you find a book a little more updated for receipts. Use this book with caution and check with your doctor or dietitian before using these receipts."
3,Eating for IBS,I found parts of this book very interesting and pertanient but the recipes were of no use to me because I have diabetes and they didn't mesh with my diabetic diet.
4,Initial reaction,My wife has just started to use the diet suggestions in Van Vorous' book. She hasn't followed the diet at 100% but even so she seems to have improvement in the level of her stomach aches. This is the first improvement she's had in years.
5,Extremely helpful,"My IBS usually acts up from stress but I decided to adhere to the guidelines in her book to see if that would help me. It's amazing, my stomach has been great for the past 3 weeks, even with me having a tremendous amount of stress. I can't tell you what a difference the diet has made. I have been having flare-ups for 11 yearsand have never known what foods aggravate the IBS. I was always told to increase my fiber but nobody ever explained the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber, and there is a BIG difference. Thanks Heather!"
3,Did not work for me.,This book did not work for me and the fiber supplement gave me terrible gas. Maybe it will work for you.I give it 3 stars because there are some really good recipes in it.
2,Recipes not for Full-Time Workers -- Too Time Consuming,"I bought this book a while ago hoping to find some tasty, easy-to-make recipes for my touchy stomach. However, after reading through the recipes, I was disappointed because the recipes all require a great deal of preparation, and a large variety of ingredients that I don't stock in my kitchen. It would have been costly and time consuming to follow these recipes. Also, the author doesn't include calorie information or how much each recipe yields like other cookbooks do.Furthermore, like another reviewer said, these recipes may be good for those who suffer from diarrhea, but they're not for those who suffer from constipation. You wouldn't want to make the rice dishes if you suffer from constipation, because rice is binding.I think the author had the right intent when she wrote this book; however, the recipes should have been made more simple, and more fitting to all life styles. Definitely not for the full-time worker--too time consuming."
1,"Maybe for IBS, NOT for Chrohn's","Good read, interesting. I have Crohn's Disease, and this is decidedly NOT a book for the type of Crohn's I have. Many of the recipes are not low residue, which is helpful for me. A word of caution--my doctor keeps insisting that I have to figure out what I can and can't eat, and in what quantities. Everyone's digestive disorder is different--at least no one in my CCFA group can eat some things I can, and I can eat some things they can't. I found the low residue information online much more helpful than this book, and IMHO I do not recommend it for anyone with a Crohn's stricture."
3,acupuncture gave me short term relief,"Hi,Yes, many suggestions in this book works as prevention. But when IBS hits me, I finally found quick relief - via Acupuncture. Mayo Clinic's Dr. Sood listed Acupuncture as his top ten alternative medicine. Here is his write up: ""In this treatment from traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncturists insert thin needles into strategic, energy-balancing points on the body. Acupuncture can prevent and treat nausea and vomiting and help relieve many types of pain, including that from osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain, headaches and postsurgical pain. Patients who receive acupuncture typically receive up to 12 treatments, usually given once or twice a week. "" One word of advise - most acupuncturists are not good. Ours teach at a Eastern Medicine University in Sunnyvale, CA and he is honest and excellent."
3,IBS Book,"Wow! Received this book in no time flat! Was very impressed with how quickly I received it. HOWEVER, the book comes from someone who smoked as it has a strong cigarette smell. I definitely do not like that."
4,"Nice book, great ""to-do"" lists","This is an excellent book for people who have never been married before as well as those who are doing it all over again. The author's lists and ""worksheets"" are excellent. Since the book is spiral bound, it's easy to use. Ms. Tatsui-D'Arcy does spend some time on nontraditional weddings; alas, I did wish for a little more information on unique approaches than she offers. Still, this is a great resource for the money."
5,Helps you keep your sanity!,"I got many ""wedding-planning"" type book at my engagement, but this was by-far the best! My husband's aunt gave it to me ... It's a workbook type thing that takes you through everything step-by-step, and it's great to keep afterwards as a momento. We've been married 5 years now and I still look at it from time to time."
2,A disappointing planner,"This planner is pretty poorly organized. For example, the section on announcing your engagement (which one might expect to be in the first chapter) isn't until Chapter 4. Setting the date is in Chapter 3, after you've already read about selecting your wedding party in Chapter 2. It doesn't make much sense to choose your attendants before you even have a date, so why organize the book that way? There also wasn't much new information in the book that I hadn't read somewhere else before. However, the checklists seem somewhat useful; I've only used the budget checklist so far. There are no pockets to hold business cards or contracts or notes, a definite drawback. If you have State Farm insurance, you can get a special edition of this book for free through your insurance agent. It sure beats paying 20 bucks for a mostly useless planner."
3,"old school helper, etiquette included","This book is so detailed. My boss recommended it to me, and while I appreciated ALL the information, there is a LOT, I was a little turned off by the section reminding me to plan my wedding around my menstrual cycle ... it seems like a great book for a perfect, southern lady ... and i'm a bit more modern than that."
1,Too Traditional,I found this planner to be way too traditional. I got the feeling it was written in the 50's when I went through it. Also very 80's themed even though it was supposed to be redone in 2000. Good only for very traditional weddings.
5,celia hits...,"this is a great cd, however not all titles listed on page are cd. cd list 19 titles, only have 14 tracks plus a video...."
1,horrible,not durable at all! my dog destroyed it in under 15 minutes. very disappointed! i do not reccommend this toy!
1,Didn't last an hour,"My lab had pieces of the tread off in 5 minutes. Also if I threw it and it hit the wall, it'd leave a black mark >:( it is already in the trash can in pieces."
2,Not for aggressive chewers,My corgi is an aggressive chewer toy consumer. He had some of the tread chewed off in 5 minutes. But I would recommend this over the tire biter brand because he didn't get sick. This is made in China.
2,Pass on this for a different kind,"I ordered three types of popcorn to sample when I bought my Whirley Pop (which by the way is friggin awesome, get one, they are cheap and work so well!), all from Wabash. I got the baby white, the baby yellow, and the ladyfinger. Using 1/2 cup of corn and 2 tablespoons of oil in the whirley, both the ladyfinger and the baby yellow would pop up fluffy enough to fill the entire whirley. The white consistently only fills about halfway...it just doesn't taste as light and crisp either. Recommend going for the ladyfinger (tastes the best and the least hulls by far, but it's so tiny it's almost hard to eat without dropping a lot) or yellow if you're trying this brand. Hope this helps."
1,DO NOT waste your money !!!!!!!!,"I have thought about ordering this product for 2 years and finally did.I had 11 inches of my colon removed 3 years ago due to diverticulosis. I LOVE popcorn, but since my surgery I had been advised to not eat it, or eat it rarely due to the hulls. I was NEVER more excited after I ordered this product.What I can honestly tell you is this products has is the same amount of hulls as the popcorn I buy at the grocery store for 1/4 the price. The small white popcorn is tender, but the hulls are still there in high volume. So I will NOT be eating it.Order at your own discretion."
2,inferior product,"So not worth the price. The people who run this company must have spent too much time working the fields in the hot sun and lost their minds. The popcorn I received was stale and tough. There are no freshness dates anywhere on the bag and it's not even sealed. It comes in a plastic bag with a wire tie, like a loaf of bread. Obviously it's been on the shelf too long and dried out. Very disappointing when you pay top price. I sent the company an email and they don't even answer."
1,Disappointed,"I had previously ordered baby hulless from Riehl's Select but tried Whirley-Pop this time since it was less expensive. It didn't seem to be baby or even remotely close to hulless, as many hulls got stuck in my teeth (and one still stuck at the back of my throat). It was lacking in taste, too - better off buying regular grocery store popcorn for the taste (if you don't mind the hulls). Amazon was great and refunded my money, but I'm going back to Riehl's baby yellow popcorn."
4,ripped bag,"popcorn is very good, But as with most other reviews the bag was ripped vertically on the side spraying kernals around. Makes you wonder about the rest of their quality control!"
3,Not what I expected.,"The popped corn was very small and didn't seem to have a lot of corn flavor, Ok, but dissappointing."
1,Disappointed and downright angry,"I ordered popcorn on September 7 and delivery continues to be postponed. The company will not allow me to cancel, claiming the order is ""being prepared for delivery."" Balony. This us a disservice and affront to customers, for the sake of a twenty dollar bill."
2,Tough and chewy,"This popcorn was tough and chewy. I have tried other ""baby white hulless popcorn"" and found it to be quite tender and crispy. I am not sure why this is not."
2,Not what I wanted.,"I ordered it, but it wasn't what I wanted and I gave it away to a family member who likes white popcorn. I won't buy it again."
5,A very readable biography,"I bought this book in the bookstore at Versailles. After my tours of the palace and the gardens looking for ghosts and wondering what life was like and what was in the heads of the people at court of Louis XIV. This is a very readable yet scholarly history book. It doesn't get into the head of Louis XIV quite so well as Antonia Fraser was able to do in her biography of Marie Antoinette, ""Marie Antoinette The Journey"". Louis XIV doesn't quite become a real person in the pages of this book however it is a beginning. This is one of the better written histories I have found."
1,Harlan Ellison,"I thought it might be interesting, but lost interest. Even Robin Williams couldn't save it. Didn't want to waste my time to watch the whole thing."
3,Harlan Ellison,"Interesting DVD. Would no recommend it. Although he is a great writer I would have rather not now about his idiosyncrasies. You don't have to be mean and nasty toward the whole world. I understand Hollywood crowd is from a different planet, but there is a great portion of us who live in the here and now."
5,Inside the mind of an Iconoclast,Wonderful look inside the mind one of America's greatest fantasists. Harlan Ellison has written some of the finest short stories in literary history. This documentary shows him in all his brilliance and in all his crankiness. He doesn't suffer fools -- and maybe we all shouldn't. But most of all he's fearless in defending Writers' Rights. And for that he should win some award.Interviews with friends on colleagues like Neil Gaiman and Robin Williams. This film has more laughs than most big studio comedies.
1,Save your money and your good attitude.,"No matter what I did to get this little bugger to work, it would not cooperate.You may fare better, but buyer beware, 'nuf said!"
1,Doesn't work,"Was unable to get this to work in my PC at all. No support, nearly impossible to find out who really made the card and how to get support from them. Had to send back to amazon for refund. Try a different brand and design, this one isn't going to work for you."
1,"Works just fine in windows, all others may want to keep looking.","I picked up a pair of these adaptors with the intention of building a small linux powered wireless access point that could do adaptive routing between a wired lan, wifi, and 3g evdo. I quickly found however that the chipset used in these cards is not well supported under linux for pcmcia cards which require DMA since the card does something strange in the way it handles interrupts. I'm sure it could be fixed in software, but I'm not a great kernel hacker nor am I motivated to become one. That said, these seem to work fine under windows XP using drivers available through windows update. Your mileage may vary, but if you intend to use linux your pcmcia cards this is probably not the device for you."
5,"Best, Most Versatile in its Class!","I absolutely love this mic. It works great no matter how I use it, whether it be male or female vocals, acoustic guitar, violin, double bass, drums or whatever you need to record. I especially love its warm, transparent sound. Of all the mics I use for recording, this is by far my most used mic. If you're only going to buy one condenser mic for your studio, it should be this one."
5,Great for Acoustic Guitar,"I recorded acoustic guitar with metal strings with this mic, and did not hear a difference with same guitar recorded using a Neuman mic.Definitely a great buy. Very versatile."
3,shure mic good only for live band not for studio,rode mic do better job than this one. it 's loud enough and clean either...rode sound better and cheaper price....
1,Where is it?,Never received this product. Where is it? It received one star because I couldn't submit the review without giving some kind of rating. Since I haven't received the product I cannot honestly give it a positive rating.
4,"5 stars in 1993, 4 stars in 1999","When this came out over 5 years ago, this was a great live album showcasing where Steven was at that point. The amazing thing is he has become so much more of an artist since then. A newer and better compilation, ""Greatest Hits"" which came out in 1997 includes two Abbey Road versions of material from ""Signs of Life"" (""The Walk"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") as well as two great new songs (""Not Home Yet"" and ""I am Found in You""). The parts in this live album where Steven talks are very personal and touching, and the overall energy in the album is tremendous. However, the ""sound"" is really not as crisp and clean as his usual studio efforts, which loses something especially for all the guitar work. All of the really great tracks on this album are on ""Greatest Hits"" which I believe is a much better introduction to his music."
5,Great CD...buy yourself one,"I got this CD a long time ago (11 years), when it came out. The concert was awesome. Anyway, you should get your own copy, and not download it illegally off the internet. It's worth it. I've been a constant fan of Steven Curtis Chapman, and will continue to. Family talk is hilarious, and shows the honesty (or lack of) of childhood. My favorite song is Busy Man...you should have seen it...ah the styles of the 90s. Haha. Get this CD...get it now. CDnow."
5,Fun Family Game - great size for travel,"Rummikub is a game that my family has enjoyed playing for the past 20 years. The attache size is very convenient to use when travelling. This was my second purchase from Amazon of the attache size Rummikub game; this time as a gift for a friend. I have not seen the attache size in any stores, so I will probably order this again from Amazon for Christmas gifts."
3,The blue color of the tiles in photo image is off!,"I bought this game based on the customer review on Amazon. To my dismay, the blue tiles are not the light blue color shown on the photo image but instead the navy color. The game would have been a lot more fun if my mother and I do not have to spend so much time trying to find out the color of the tiles on our hand. Today while I am playing with the ladies in the Senior Center, they have a hard time to tell the difference between the orange tiles and the red tiles. As for the blue and black tiles, it is even harder. The game is a lot of fun when the color of the tiles is not a factor to hold you back on speed to play the game. We do have a very good time in playing the game. We had tried it with five players and inital number osf 20 to start and it worked out fine."
4,A Good murder mystery and love story with interesting twists and turns,This is a great read. Most of Fred's earlier books were westerns. This takes place in the tough East Texas oilfields around the1930s. I couldn't stop reading it but didn't want it to end.
5,Great read!,Wonderful tale of Texas in the early days. Bean does a great job of capturing the period and the people of the time. Characters are fun to read about and the plot kept me involved throughout the novel. Super book!
5,"Good, reliable battery","I bought two of these for my point and shoot digital camera and could not be happier with them. Both provide a reliable source of power, allowing me to take about 500 shots with a single charge."
3,"Ridiculous price, great item.","I agree with everyone here in that the Dark Shadows revival series aired on NBC in the early 90s was one of the best re-makes ever made. It far eclipses the original. However, the price for ONE EPISODE on an outdated vhs tape? Are these people insane? These days nobody pays HALF that price for a vhs tape of a complete full-length feature film. It's pretty rare to pay this much even for a DVD with ""special features"" on it. VHS is simply not a viable medium anymore and the price Amazon's quoting is four times what a single episode is worth."
4,Why is this not available on DVD ???,"This is one series I have never forgotten. To think I could own it but 12 VHS tapes in this day and age?? You must be joking! Someone out there needs to get on the ball and release this series on DVD. I would be the first in line to purchase, all the way from Downunder! The story was brilliant, the cast magnificent. Please do something about a DVD version! It is worthy of it. As such a DVD version would rate 5 stars."
1,dark shadows 1991,i give this a 1 star because its on vhs tape .until theres a restored dvd copy . i will have to copy my tapes to dvd that i have picture not the best better then nothing .the price on the tapes you have gett real iam not paying that price unless its on dvd . better tell dan curtis to get on the stick and give good dvd copy of it to us
4,"May be hard to find, but worth the look""","This book is now 7 years old and may be a little hard to find but perhaps you could find it in a used bookstore as I did. The plot is very easy to follow and the characters are all very believeable. Paul Bishop is a veteran homicide cop in Los Angeles (at least he was at the time of this book). The book revolves around the death of a woman who's fingerprints identify her as someone who was murdered 18 years before. The woman's ex- husband may or may not have done the deed. Fey Croaker the lead investergator on the case is one tough cop. The book has a lot of twists and is a pretty quick read. If you like police novels and who-done its, you'll really like this one."
4,One tough cop!,"This story has, hands down, one of the best foot chase scenes in print. Fey Croaker is a tough lady cop--which is different than a female cop. Bishop writes hard, real characters who come off the page and defy the reader to put the book down even to sleep. Start this one early in the evening, otherwise you'll still be awake at dawn."
5,awsome stuff,"i just started getting into emo and punk recently, my freind encouraged me to seeing fall out boy with dont look down and punchline so i went and im very happy i did.punchline played a couple of songs from action and they were great. i bought the cd after the show and got to meet steve from punchlinethe cd is great, it is a must have for fans of the genre"
2,What it sounds like to be unoriginal,"Fueled by ramen needs to give it up already. The only reason people even know their name is thanks to FaLLOuTBOY. Punchline is yet another pathetic excuse to cash in on the stale, dying pop-punk scene. As a guitar player of 2 years, I can safely say that there is NOTHING original about the music itself, and the lyrics are passable, at best. I had high hopes for this album after hearing Heart Transplant, but after two listens, I was bored and ready to move on. Another problem w/ ""Action"" (besides the music and lyrics) is that it seems to drag on endlessly, and while the songs are only 3 or 4 minutes in length, they seem to go on for a lifetime. I will give them credit for track 8 tho, they ripped a page right out of New FOund Glory's playbook and managed to pull it off pretty well. Overall, Punchline's ""action"" is just another lame attempt to ripoff other, more popular bands like brand new and Jimmy eat world. Two years from now, no one will remember their names."
1,"Boring, bland, stale and formulaic","There hasn't been a pop-rock album this stale and boring since simple plan and good charlotte tortured us with their 2002 releases of ""young and hopeless"" and ""No balls"". I consider myself a straight-ahead rock fan who loves FOB. It was only for that reason that I even got ""action"" (and to the reviewer below me, it IS okay to compare two bands on the same label and expect similar greatness. You don't make the rules about what one should expect from another's labelmate). Anyway, I felt like this album was a piece of s**t, and after two or three listens, i threw it in the trash. If you like The Academy is or the legendary FOB (both are labelmates) DO NOT GET ACTION! Buy ""Take this to your grave"", ""Deja entendu"" or ""Almost here"" instead."
5,WOW,"This is an AMAZING CD. I bought it a few weeks ago after liking their Rewind EP, and this is a big step up. This CD hasn't left my CD player since i opened the package. I just cant stop listening to it and im sure that you wont be able to either."
3,A treasure,Never thought I'd find this CD-Got it 4 my daughter-She was so happy.Thank -U .Great CD We got together and listened to the Songs in her apartment and the car.She called her mom in New Brunswick just to tell her she had the CD.
1,Pandering at its worst,"This album is typical of everything wrong with ""contemporary Christian"" music. Jumping from style to style, Carman attempts story songs, ballads, hip hop, and traditional gospel without doing any of them well.The lyrics are utterly juvenile, asking listeners to get ""alive with God- addicted to Jesus"" and dance the ""holy ghost hop"". His song ""Satan Bite the Dust"" reveals his black/white thinking- he evidently believes the alcoholism is caused by demons. How does he attempt to defeat such ""demons""? By being ""authorized and deputized to blow [them] clean away.""This is possibly one of the worst albums ever released, amounting to little more than religious cheerleading, sloganeering, and pandering."
1,Blasphemy,"""The Holy Ghost Hop"" is blasphemy. I can't speak for the rest of the album, not being able to get past ""The Hop."" These days you can yodel any foolishness in the name of Christ and people will buy it. I wish Amazon had a negative star rating."
1,Worst Music since anything by DC Talk,"I remember I was forced to put up with this cd when I was in grade school by stupid teachers that try to instill their values on every one of their students at my wonderful lutheran school. Addicted to Jesus has got to be the worst song of all time, We were forced to dance to it in front of the school like a bunch of ... cherubs to this music, I hate it and feel like crying when I remember it. I am glad I am past that part of my life and have rejected christian music and now listen to KMFDM."
5,One of my favorite Carman albums.,"A2J is a classic Christian album of the early 90's. It was the top selling Christian release of 1992. There are many different styles on this album, which Carman does well. Carman gets help from Petra, Ce Ce Winas, Gold City, Commissioned, and dc Talk on this record. There are many heartfelt, convicting songs on this album. Hunger for Holiness is one of my favorite Christian ballads I know. The title track makes you wanna dance, and The Third Heaven, which was written for Carman's father, is a beautiful, descriptive of a man entering heaven. I reccomend this to anyone interested in Christian music. Buy this record from the master storyteller."
2,What planes does it work on?,"I traveled on four modern, recently commissioned planes, including the Boeing 777, and none of them had outlets for the Apple Airline Power Adapter. I assume it would work well, if I could plug it in. For me, however, a waste of $50."
2,No good for car,"I bought mine in a store, and it appears to have a 12V cigarette adapter. I get the product home and pull it out of the packaging and read the fine print. Only usable on some airlines. Will not work in cars.Scanning the blogs, it seems that Apple isn't interested in providing a car adapter. They also don't seem to be interested in licensing the mag safe adapter so someone else can produce it.I guess this is just my fault for buying into a closed proprietary platform.I give it 2 stars cause airline adapters aren't very useful. And while it is not the product's fault, if you are looking for a car adapter, this is not for you!"
1,Don't work with macbook pro,"Beware don't work with macbook pro, I've tried in American, Continental and Delta even in my car, in the airlines blew the fuse in my car I get a green light but don't charge the battery."
1,Hey apple pay attention!,Would not even give it 1 star but had to or amazon wouldnt let me post. This thing doesnt work on many airlines!! 13 hours between Tokyo and New York and my Mac pro works only 2 hours because I cant use the charger at 85 watts! The plane only allows 75 and your magsafe doesnt work on 777's! This is a modern plane! Get with it provide a solution or you lose me and many business people!
5,NO OUTLETS,YES the PROBLEM is almost NO airplanes have a place to plug this in. The ONLY time I ever saw one was on United Biz class from Japan BUT of course I didn't have the thing with me. My feeling is if you need more than one battery you are computing too much. Shut er down and have a drink you geek.BUT/HOWEVER it seems to work in the car.
2,"wtf, mate?","Music is cool but not diggin the guys voice. Would be nice if I could understand a word he was saying. Plus i have no respect for the remaining ""Misfits"" and Jerry Only. Because of this I give it only 2 stars. While the music is pretty good, I wouldnt recommend this album unless ur a fan of words that sound like jibberish"
5,Fantastic,I saw this recording performed in concert a number of years ago. The music is phenominal. Anyone with an appreciation for Handel's Messiah living in the day of modern music will love this. I am on my 2nd copy of the CD because I wore the first one out. It gets me in the spirit for the holidays every year.
1,Horrifying,"Let's see. Take one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, and turn it into bubble-gum pop tripe? People need to learn how to appreciate good music, rather than dumb down great music and call it wonderful. If you want to write something new, feel free. Do it in the ""spirit"" of the Messiah, even. But don't destroy a great work of art just to sell CDS to an unsophisticated listening audience."
1,a tragic destruction of a sacred work,"as much as I love the Messiah, and as much as I enjoyed the fresh new arrangement of the original Young Messiah, I was horrified by this production.It is one thing to create new arrangements of old scores, but to trash the original and replace it with garbage is a tragedy.I had this cd, and I traded it in for other used albums - it was one of the worst pieces of music I have ever heard, and I cannot recommend it to anyone who loves the Messiah and the story it tells."
3,Went Free to Play (F2P),"This game went free to play, and in this market i doubt there is anything better at moment (only Sword of the new world).You only buy this game now if:1 - want support CodeMasters;2 - Dont got conection to dload the client via web (1,5 gigas btw);3 - want chantra (in game money).Update: After 7 months: ZU online (zu.igg.com) and ROHAN (playrohan.com) are far better choices that archlord."
1,"Sad, Bad, and painful","1. You can not change gender, race, or any true aspects of your character.2. How do you make a linear MMOG? Thats why we play MMOG's for a nonlinear game.3. Graphics are sad bad and choppy.4. Game controls are painful and weird.5. The game world is small6. The storyline in not inherently clear."
5,TJ for the Hall,"The drama of TJ's battles with Dallas Green leave the reader wanting more. A great book by a man who played the game with class and heart. Thanks, TJ!!!"
4,Tommy John has Hall of Fame stuff,Tommy John began his 26 season career in MLB when JFK was in office and ended it at the dawn of the steroids era in the late 1980's. In other words Tommy is a man who has seen and done it all. Along the way he won 288 games in his Hall of Fame worthy career. I recommend this book to any baseball fan who wants to see what the game is like from the inside. I learned a lot.
2,"not new, may not be real","the ""zippo"" i got, if it truly even is a zippo was opened when i recieved it. the orange sticker that is supposed to be on the lighter was instead on a plastic bag that it was in. because this raised my suspicion, as soon as i opened the package, i took the insert out and compared the date on it with the date on the bottom, the date on the insert was d 07 (april 2007) and the date on the case was c 07 (march 2007). this tells me that these pieces were not originally together... on top of that, the sound that a zippo should make when opened (a high pitched echoey sound) was instead a dull thump. this makes me think that it may not even be real!the only reason i'm giving it two stars is because it still looks sharp as hell."
5,The Ultimate Way to learn French,"I remember the first time I used Tell Me More. I was amazed by the quality of the product. I could not believe what I was seeing. Tell me more is the best software to use to learn French. This software transports to you to a whole new world in France. It enables you learn the French language and the French culture. This software enables you to improve your accent while improving on your vocabulary. As a result, the learner becomes fluent in the French language; while speaking the language with a French accent. In addition, the practice exercises are interesting and educational. As a French tutor in college, I will strongly recommend Tell Me More to you."
1,Not the same shoe as the first one I had,"I work in a factory on concrete 8 hours a day, I had a pair of these shoes that were great, wore them every day for work. So decided I would purchase the same one. Found that after wearing the second pair of shoes it would become painful to walk on my right leg, it seems the footbed is uneven. Not uncomfortable wearing around the house but on a long walk it is like my foot uneven and twisting when I walk. I don't understand it and maybe the next pair would work but will be staying away from these!"
1,No so much,wasnt exciting or interesting enough. I just couldnt get into very much it lack keeping my attention so not so much for me
4,Real love meeting real life,"Some of the reviews of this movie are simply pointless. This movie displays real situations and shows that love can overcome anything. Yes, indeed, one or two actors lack the connection with their characters but was their acting none the less insightful and left you wanting more...NO! We want to see the outcome in the future of this bright and promising cast of characters and the people who play them.Do I want a little more meat on the bone? Sure! Its the Young and The Restless on a diet. But what a great meal!"
5,Life's lessons,"It was provocative in every way, sexy at times, challenging, hilarious, melodramamtic, warm and sincere. It's the kind of thing that most people go through when dealing with romantic relationships;straight or gay. Living life and trying to hold down a realtionship can get very complicated at times and at other times, we could be the source of the problem of why it doesn't work out because of our own fears and insecurities. Overall, I've enjoyed the second ""Finding me: The Truth"" much more than the first one, because it kept moving right along from one interesting scene to another and there were very few slow spots, if any at all."
3,not the best/not the worst,it wasnt as good as the first but it was cool....the character growth arc wasnt there. didnt like the ending much either...acting lacked much to be desired. story line was weak. but it was worth watching i guess.
4,A Great Sequel,"In Finding Me, i got an idea of who the characters were, their personality, and what they stood for. However, it didnt hold my attention very long. When I found out that there would be a sequel I thought...maybe Ill just wait until someone uploads it to youtube and watch it there...and if its good enough I will support the film and make the purchase. I'm kind of impatient so i decided not to wait. I MUST SAY that Finding Me: Truth was in fact a great sequel! I saw progression in each character, was introduced to new characters, noticed better acting skills, saw more drama, and I laughed more. I truly hope that there will be a part 3, eventhough Jay, ""Maurice Murell"", passed away last year around this time. Its a shame that we don't have many (black) gay films out! Its 2012! and male and female actors need to grow some balls! I thank the cast,directors, writers, and everyone behind the scenes for their hard work :)"
3,Fun with a circle of friends watching over cocktails,"I enjoyed this sequel to Finding Me. Great to see another Gay Black fim that is not porn. Weonly get one release every 4 or 5 years (if ever). So, support GAY BLACK CINEMA. I do.R.I.P. Maurice Murrell. He is the scene stealer for this fun young urban tale of same gender loving brothers. I suggest showing this with a hip click of friends over strong toxic cocktails. Tip it!"
4,Hard to put down,"Starts with a fast plot and picks up speed, then twists at the end. The main characters are likeable as well--good reading."
5,FUNKY!,"AURRA was Tight.An OFFSPRING OF SLAVE THE FUNK BAND OUT OF OHIO which has had many Great Bands come from their.Make Up Your Mind,Are You Single,etc.. are still the Jams.THE VOICES ARE Great&THE MUSIC still Grooves."
4,Too Many Tracks,"Aurra is one of my favorite groups, but this anthology should have been limited to one CD instead of two. There are clearly some tracks that do not represent the best that the group has to offer. Other than that mild complaint its a great package."
5,Aurra's Music Is Timeless,"Unlike some who didn't approve of Aurra having released a 2 disc greatest hits Cd, I am pleased with both Cd's.I am a big fan of Slave also. The vocals from songstress Starleana Young and her male counterpart Curt Jones brings back fond memories of the year 1981 when music to me was really Slammin!,they really harmonized good! together And according to my opinion no one or any female singer today sounds better than Starleana,to bad she didn't get the recognition she so richly deserves, Oh yeah! just mentioning Aurra puts a smile on my face."
3,Essential songs missing,"Aurra has a great sound and this compilation makes that clear but I don't understand how, in this 2 CD compilation, they could have left out 'HAPPY FEELING' and 'LIKE I LIKE IT'!"
2,I WENT TO THEIR CONCERT IN 1982 .. BUT.....,2 HITS ARE BETTER THAN ONE.. ARE YOU SINGLE AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND.. BUT THE REST I NEVER HEARD. I WENT TO THEIR CONCERT IN SAN DIEGO AND LOVED THEM.. BUT I DONT FAKE THE FUNK.. 2 HITS AND THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO RELEASE A 2 CD GREATEST HITS.. WHAT A JOKE.
5,A rollicking reading adventure!! :-),"What an adventure this new novel is!! :-)I just got this new book and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down!! I'm now buying copies for all my girlfriends and demanding they read this book!!Jessie's midlife crisis, and the trouble and boredom of her marriage to the straight-arrow banker Turner, is like a cross between something by Ann Tyler & Sex and the City, & a movie by the Coen brothers!! It's laugh out loud funny, but with real heart.Buy this one ladies!! You won't regret it!! :-)"
3,Not Enough For Me,"I like this genre of book- middle-age woman suddenly finding herself lost in life & begins exploration. I just couldn't help but have a difficult time in finding a lot of originality within the pages.I wanted it funnier & there are parts I think could've been, but simply fizzled. I found it particularly amusing when our heroine went back home for a visit & had to share the same roof with her sister's many exotic, talking birds.Not much stood out in this book. It was okay, but I was expecting at least a bit more boundary-pushing going on. Not just a home visit spent looking back on first loves then finally figuring out that your present home w/ hubby is not so bad."
2,A False Sense of A Good Book...,"I probably should of listened to the reviews I read on this book before I started it. Most people here didn't care much for it, but I thought it sounded like great southern reading...well I was wrong. This was one of the dullest books I've read in a long time.The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is beacause of Wanda McNabb, the one character in the book that I liked. The rest of the cast was so one dimensional and drab that I barley made it through. Jessie turned out to be just a predictable bored housewife.Overall, this is definitely not a book I'd recommend. It's just a winey account of an upper middle-class wife who's tired of the normal hum-drum of her life. There's absolutely better reading out there."
2,And your point is???,"This is supposed to be a mid-life crisis book. Forget it. It's wrapped up too neatly at the end. So now Jessie thinks her husband Turner is a good guy. How did that happen? A couple of funny situations, a few poignant observations, but, otherwise a disappointing read."
3,Take it or leave it (I vote for the latter),"The gushing reviews on the back jacket from respected authors made me pick this book up, not to mention that I'm [drawn to] books from the ""woman in search of meaning"" genre. But you won't find a lot of meaning here. This is a rather meandering, pointless tale of someone who can't really put her finger on the cause of her malaise. There is no real satisfaction to be had here for the reader, either.Jesse Maddox drifts through this story, and we drift along with her (not always upleasantly, in all fairness, there are a few good moments). ..."
1,Thoroughly Disappointed,"I had a very difficult time getting into this book. The characters were shallow, the plot undeveloped, and overall a complete waste of time. I would expect ""searching for self"" books to be a little more deep and rich than this poor read."
2,Boring,"After 60 pages, i got the idea already: she's bored with her husband and most of her life. maybe something more interesting happens later, but i stopped there."
2,"Underdeveloped characters,","I found this book to be poorly written, characters under developed and the storylines dull. I find it hard to believe that this is an award winning book with obvious errors that any highschool english teacher would have marked in red. Example: Pages 68-71 the author describes a sceene with 2 boys and David throwing a softball. As the sceene progresses, the ball mysteriously changes to a football. Also, the final page, she is not waltzing with Calvin Thacker. Who the heck is Calvin Thacker???? I give this novel a D+."
2,It's OK,"The video explains the basic moves well, but when they go into the routine they do close ups of Scott Coles upper body so you can't see what he's doing. Furthermore he doesn't say a word in this section so even if you memorize the moves there's really no way of telling what you should be doing."
2,Frustrating,I was very disappointed. Every time my 14 month old tried to insert a shape the water would push it back toward him because instead of floating it kept filling with water and would half sink. The bottom won't stay attached to the top causing the whole thing to capsize.I ended up throwing it away after watching my child get more and more frustrated trying to use it.And the spout of water isn't a spout it's a pathetic little trickle. Hardly enough to notice.Definitely not worth the money.
2,Can be fun but not for what it was intended,"Not the best toy, I'd look for another bath toy.As other reviewer has mentioned, the ""spray"" is almost nonexistent. The only thing that gets accomplished is getting water in the toy which probably causes mold or biofilm in the toy itself to grow.The whale can be separated to remove the shapes that can be inserted into the whale. Unfortunately the toy tends to remain in 2 halves.Shapes do fit in the holes on the whale if the child is dexterous enough to hold the whale and the shape at the same time - otherwise, just use all the pieces separately. Not great but better than throwing the whole thing away."
2,Looks so fun but disappoints,"The whale looked so cute and colorful in the packaging. I bought it because I couldn't find the Fisher Price bath whale. Once I got it in the tub with my son I could see it was a bad toy. It sinks immediately and the water it supposedly squirts is a drop at a time. My son LOVES toys that squirt water and he was bored with this toy. He never reaches for it in the tub and ignores it if I give it to him. He'd rather play with his rubber duck. After he gets more bath toys for his birthday, I'm giving this lame whale to Goodwill!"
4,Fantasy novels are rarely this thought-provoking.,"As the first book of a trilogy, this works very well. After a slowish start, the story improves and the characters become more interesting than the average fantasy hero/villain. Putting the concept of reincarnation to use in a fantasy novel is a great idea. It's particularly effective because it leaves one believing that there are a lot more surprises to come in the final books. Fantasy series often leave the reader with the journey clearly mapped out after the first book or so; with this one, the future is a lot less obvious, and so a lot more intriguing. This book triggers plenty of philosophical thoughts, but they flow along with the action rather than distracting from it. The glossary is a good addition as it provides useful background to the ideas used. If you are bored with unoriginal fantasy, check this out for a refreshing change!"
5,An attention grabber. Non stop action.,"A great book if you like Sci Fi fantasy. From the past life karma to thier present incarnations the karmic twins battle for the fate of the tree of life, and the fate of the material plane."
2,I agree terrible,"It only gets two stars because its OKD, but Jon Peters simply does not fit OKD. It sounds like OKD changed their sound to noisecore just to fit him. If you want to get a sense of OKD, do not buy this album."
3,"heavier, but less impressive","The vocals on this album are intense, but the songwriting just isnt the same as Bloodlust Revenge. Not only are the lyrics below par for OKD, but the intensity of their music does not hold throughout the entire disc. The only truly exceptional song on this album is All to Gray. The rest are good, but definately not a step forward for OKD. Too bad this album had to be their last."
1,This album is terrible,"I loved Bloodlust revenge, but this album was a huge letdown. It has non of Bloodlusts good qualities. Just mindless masturbating with snapcasy lead guitar riffs."
4,"The epitome of convenience, with limited color choices.","I LOVE my cushtop! It allows me to conveniently use or set aside my laptop when i'm on the couch watching TV or in bed just lounging around. The laptop keeps cool, as does my lap. My only regret is that they don't come in very many colors, which I feel is this product's greatest drawback. It would be cool if the inner cavity was a little bigger, or if the inner cavity was made of flexible material. As it is now, it's really hard to store anything in there other than papers, flash drives, and other little, thin items. Mice don't fit unless you cram and jam them."
1,never received item,"I never received this item and have attempted to contact seller AccelleratedSales559 as well as amazon no reply from either in over 30 days, just a big waste of time and money!! Don't do business with them."
2,"Not as ""New"" as I expected","I received the item within 48 hours of it shipping. That part was great. I opened the box expecting to find a ""new"" Belkin Cushtop....what I found was a Cushtop that had obviously already been used. There are spots on the top and the bottom. It almost looks like someone set it in something and it stained. Have you ever seen detergent spots on clothing?? That is what this looks like. When something is listed on Amazon as ""new"" it should still have the factory plastic on it. If it has been used for even one day you shouldn't be marking it as ""new""."
2,great idea but,product is very good idea but not satisfactory to me because 1- my laptop iself still gets hot although my lap is protected from the heat 2 - I have a 8.9inch notebook so this is WAY! too large and finally 3 - again because of it's size not portable at allLove the colour though!!!.JAMAICA GRL
3,comodo...en las piernas,es muy comodo y funcional cuando estas sentando en el sofa por ejemplo pero puesto sobre alguna mesa o escritorio queda muy alto y es algo molesto si se esta usando un mouse externo.
4,Belkin Cushtop Notebook Stand - Green,It does what it says it does...COOL! The green is a bit noxious though.
4,Lovely and comfortable cushtop; storage... not so much.,"I recently bought this cushtop for my 17"" Spring Green Dell Inspiron 1720 laptop and I have not regretted this purchase. I was a bit concerned that it might look a little weird or if it would be too bulky at first, but its curve actually makes writing in my laptop easier -- the fact that it keeps my legs nice and cool is a big plus also. :)As far as storing goes, you can only put very thin things in there... my mouse won't fit in there unless I force it (but then taking it out is kind of annoying) and my big bulky AC adapter won't fit in there either. But if cables bother you, the ""storing space"" is definitively convenient because you just let them pass underneath you; it's like they're not even there. Actually, the main purpose of the storage space I've given it is for easier handling as I carry it around...Anyway, YES. Buy this."
1,More like a notebook slide than stand,"There is no traction on this notebook ""stand"" so my Macbook laptop slides right off the smooth angled top and onto my lap. Completely non-functional as a lap desk or stand of any kind, unless you want your computer crashing to the floor when you're not looking!Unlike other reviewers, I like the look and color options for this, but none of that matters if the darn thing doesn't do what it's supposed to."
2,Pure Description,"This book is a survival tale with a very predictable plot. Of course, if you're a fan of blizzards and want to read a 60-page description of one, this is the book for you."
3,Winter Thunder Review,"When reading ""Winter Thunder,"" I found the book to be just okay. I think the author, Mari Sandoz, portrayed the children and teacher well. Mari Sandoz showed each of the character's strengths and weaknesses to coming up with ideas to save them from the fierce blizzard. After eight days with barely no food or shelter, rescue teams come for help. I think this book is exciting to a certain degree. I would recommend this book to someone who likes to be a ""Survivor."""
2,Winter Thunder,"I thought this book was ok. there could have been alot more action andit also could have been longer, I don't think i would recommend this book to anyone."
5,Oh Come On,"The display of ignorance and Shah apologists on this forum is simply appalling. And while many here are pointing out that Kinzer's hypothesis is oversimplification (Ajax-Islamic Revolution-WTC) it really isn't. Imagine a world where the Shah didn't have to be ousted by Khomeini and his followers. Imagine a world where Iran still held the United States in good graces. What exactly did we gain by this coup except the result of the first Islamic Republic, one that was fundamentally opposed to our interests in the region, and in many ways the way we live. Oh, and one more thing. They don't hate us for what we've done and merely who we are? What are you smoking my friend? Do you imagine that our intervention in their homeland is just something they can shrug off, whilst hating us indiscrimantely based on what borders we live inside? Jesus. Anyway. Good book."
3,History as hagiography,"This book is very strong if you want a coherent and readable account of what happened. Another bonus is you can read it in a day. But I must admit that I found the author's tone vis-a-vis Mossadegh himself quite annoying. The portrait borders on worship. Mossadegh becomes an almost religious figure.Kinzer also makes the ridiculous if predictable claim that a straight line can be drawn from the 1953 coup to 9/11, explicitly contradicting his own caveats about how history should not be reduced to a linear series of cause and effect, etc.In sum, the guy's a bleeding heart, but that doesn't necessarily detract from his ability to report the story. Except that it would be nice to have a more realistic portrayal of Mossadegh himself, rather than this idealized angelic version."
2,A Well Told Story but One Sided,"This book makes the West look like all they care about is ripping off the Arab countries, taking their oil for the multinational oil companies. If only politics and history were this simple!"
5,Great Historical Read,"This is one of the best books I've read in quite a while. It is an entertaining history of former Persia and modern day Iran. I can't recall any part of the book that dragged along.Kinzer does a great job of staying objective. At no point did I feel the author's opinion was overbearing or even existent. I would suggest this as a ""must read"" for anyone interested in foreign policy concerning the middle east. Today's politics make much more sense with the history of Iran in mind."
3,All the Shah's Men,"An interesting and informative account of Iranian history in the twentieth century. Gives the reader a good understanding of how modern day Iran and its people were shaped. However, reader needs to be interested in political history as well because much of the history recounts political struggle. These in depth political sections tend to drag a bit if the reader is not very politically minded."
3,A sad tale,"Kinzer's is an instructive, gripping, and useful book (should anyone be paying attention), though the writing is often surprisingly amateurish."
2,Ignorance may be bliss when Iran is concerned,"While I respect Mr.Kinzer's points regarding the coup and Mossadegh, but once again comes another book that demonizes the Shah. Although he was not an ideal leader, why is it that the US condemned the Shah's SAVAK and human rights conditions when many countries in the West, as well as Turkey, have committed worse? Why does the US and other human rights organizations not fully condemn the Iranian government? It is frustrating to read another account by someone on the outside who had no insider's view of the real events. It is no woder that most Iranians believe in conspiracy theories that the US/Britain had a hand in establishing the Islamic government in Iran. It is a true tragedy."
4,What happend to Mossadegh?,"The topline in this book is quite simple, how does Kermit Roosevelt, working for the CIA, execute the role model regime change operation in Iran in 1953, replacing the Time Man of the Year, Mohammed Mossadegh, with Mohammed Reza Shah.I usually like Kinzer's writing style, having read his columns for years in the New York Times. He uses the same Graham Greene model of fast narration, time shifts and strong characterization to build the suspense in this novel.The couple of negative points are that he has not drawn much inference from this episode to other geopolitical events of the world and what are the cause-effects of this incident. Hopefully, we will wait for the sequel.All in all, well worth a read.Fred G. Sanford"
5,Insights to Iran,"This is a fine read; well written and quite enlightening. It should be required reading for high school history/economics students. Also, the subject leads to dynamic discussions for book clubs.SBA"
4,The Evolution of Persia into Modern Day Iran,"This book gives a fascinating history of Iran in the early to middle 20th century. It made the subsequent modern history of Iran much clearer for me, especially the embassy hostage incident and the anger at the US/CIA as an imperialist ""Great Satan"". My only quarrel with the book is that it would have been better if it were organized on a more linear timeline, rather than jumping forward and backward in time. Still, a very informative and engaging book to read. Also check out the author's ""Crescent and Star: Turkey Between Two Worlds"" and Robin Wright's ""The Last Great Revolution : Turmoil and Transformation in Iran""."
4,Essential reading for those interested in Iran,"I took a long time finishing this book primarily because I find the story of how two imperialistic, self-styled 'democracies' plotted to crush a very proud people's experiment in launching a democratic country very depressing. Kinzer isn't an Iranian sympathizer or closet communistic as some right wingers suspect. He strives to point out the mistakes Mossadegh made as well in trying to navigate what were very dangerous political waters, made more so by Churchill and Kermit Roosevelt."
5,Iranian blowback,"As an American who spent two years in Tehran during the 1950's, I was much aware of the impact of the coup and its immediate aftermath that is described Kinzer's book. It puts my memories of the time and the people into a excellent history and adds information about the coup that was not known to me. Working at the university I was aware of the bitterness of the people that I knew--students, faculty, business people and ministry employees. They were skeptical that any good could come from relations with the U.S., though they were always friendly to me and my family. Through Kinzer's book I have a better understanding of the events that followed the overthrow of Mossadegh, even unto today."
5,Understanding our dilema in the Middle East,"The author is able to make good reading out of the history of the west's multiple errors in diplomacy reguarding the middle east and Iran in particular. Almost a road map as to the cause of their mistrust and hatred of America.George Bush should read this. Sorry, I forgot he does not read."
4,Great intro and ending; deceptive title,"The majority of this book deserves three stars, while chapters 1, 11 and 12 deserve five; hence, my four-star review.The beginning and the end of this book are well-written, fast-paced and informative. What lies in between is slower, less interesting and can definitely be skipped if you just want to read the story of the coup, without intimate details of everything leading up to it in the preceding two years or so.Also, don't be drawn to this book for the second part of its title, which refers to Middle East Terror. That reference is deceptive, presumably intended to take advantage of the reading public's current demand for terrorism-related books. In fact, this book has little to say about terrorism and its relation to the coup of 1953. If that's what you're interested in, just borrow someone else's copy and read the fourteen pages from 202 to 215."
5,Understanding the roots of Middle East mistrust of America,"I read my copy of this book years ago and found it enlightening. This Christmas I bought another copy from Amazon to give to my Grandson, who has started college and has a new interest in the Middle East foreign policy. He was intrigued, found it a well researched and an exciting read. It engendered a call from a Grandson! Great.CC"
5,Terrific history of Iran coup,"All the Shah's Men is a terrific overview of the history of Iran and especially the details of the coup that the US (with British help and support) orchestrated to take out the very popular leader of Iran. The history drags a little bit, but the coup itself is very gripping. I had no idea that British Petroleum started out as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. And who knew the Eisenhower administration would be so eager to please the British and to take out a major leader in the Middle East. Kinzer is a good writer and does jump to some conclusions, but overall it is an excellent historical narrative and recommended to anyone who wonders why people in the Middle East aren't too keen on the US."
4,A true shame for the US foriegn policy,"The book is well written. Even as an Iranian I was not aware of many facts written and mentioned in this book. All in all it a true shame for the uS foreign policy and very short view and the small horizon of the US politions at times. Well we saw the same disaster recenlty that lead us in the senseless war in Iraq. One said; If you don't learn from the History, it will repeat itself! Like it did with George W."
1,blah..blah..blah...,"Yet another attempt to bash the Shah and the golden days of Iran under the Shah. Yes, the shah was not mother Teresa, but neither he was Changiz Khan! Ask any Iranian of 40+ years old living in Iran what is their greatest wish coming from heart, and they tell you to go back to 1979 and destory in the most brutal manner anyone who said ""Death to the Shah"".If you truly want to know what happened in 1953, read PALACE OF SOLITUDES by the Shah's first wife Soraya."
1,Left wing hack,"This book is written through a leftist perspective and is full of resentment for the late Shah of Iran and the United States of America. The author thinks the entire terrorism thing is a result of 1953 coup against PM Mossadeq but the truth to the matter is that the hatred for the west existed hundreds of years before the events of 1953 or even 1979 for that matter. Radical Islamic terrorists hated the western way of life way before the 1953 coup. And the author fails to grab this fact. Yes, the coup was a mistake but when we put it in Iranian historical context it was a wise and important decision. Shah put PM Mossadeq in power in 1951 and when he asked Mossadeq to resign, he resisted and it resulted in the ugly events of 1953. Had Mossadeq resigned, there wouldn't be any coup and there would not be any problem at all."
1,The Shah has been underestimated,"The Shah of Iran is siad to be a ruthless viscous dictator who suppressed human rights and Islam. Now this book wants us to beleive this is all because we helped the Shah overtunr a brutal communist Muslim who was about to take over the country.Lets examine the facts. The Shah gave women the vote. The Shah wanted ot modernize his country. Ask Iranians if they prefer to go back to the 1970s rather then live in an Islamofascist society where women are crushed and everyone is poor and people were used like cattle in the war with Iraq. This book is wrong. The Shah helped his people and it was necceary for us to support his maintaining his throne. Moossedeq was a brutal monster who wanted to abuse human rights as much if not more so then the shah and steal the money foriegners ahd invested in the country. Which was worse the Shahs torture chambers or Khomeinis??? Lets compare torture cchamber to torture chamber, thats rediuculous. They were both brutal."
2,Red Devil 3222 vs Stanley 28-100,"Length:: 2:45 MinsIn this video I compare the Red Devil 3222 Push/Pull Window Scraper against theStanley 28-100 1-3/16-inch High Visibility Mini-Razor Blade Scraper.Red Devil 3222 Window Scraper:Pros: Metal & Quicker to make safeCons: More annoying during operation, can't apply pressure, expensiveStanley 28-100:Pros: Smaller, lighter, brighter, can apply more pressure, cheaperCons: Blades can some times come out"
1,Terrible Product!!!!,"I cannot even fathom why this product was sold to me. It was old and did not work at all. It was so defective the razor wouldn't even stay in place. I had to stop trying to use it and throw it out. I'm not sure where they got this, but I don't recommend anyone buying it ever!!!!I finally found one at Home Depot that worked properly!"
1,POOR Customer Service,"We started with a PB8200. After less than 2 weeks, it died. BenQ immediately replaced it with an ""upgraded"" PB8250. (Apparently, they had MANY problems with the 8200 model). Well, something went wrong with the motor in our 8250 around Christmas time and it became very noisy. We sent it in to BenQ January 29. It has been in the shop for a month now! This is inexcusable, considering they advertise a warranty that guarantees a replacement within 48 hours if there are problems in the first year. (Thank goodness this projector is for home use, not running a business!) In a nutshell, we are disappointed that TWO BenQ projectors have failed us in less than a year AND we have received poor customer service. FYI - Picture quality was great when it was working."
5,Simply wonderful author,"This was required reading for a class I took. I was deeply moved by it. She shared her intermost feelings telling about her own grief and her own loss. She was also a guest speaker at this class. Clara Hinton is such a warm and caring person. Even if you haven't suffered the loss of a child this book can help you to help those that did. It made me cry, I truly had felt her loss. She really needs to go on the Oprah show."
3,A Very Good Book,"This book talks about all types of loss, from miscarriages to the death of a child. It is a very good book if you are looking for a general book on grief and loss. If you are looking for a book which main focus is about miscarriage, I would not recommend this book. Also at times the author does discuss faith and using faith to find your way through the darkness which is not for everyone."
4,Chicks'll dig it,"Of all of Bukowski's work that I've read (most all,) this fabulous heap of short stories is one of my all-time favorites. Buk's issues are all out on the table for you to pick at, unapologetically and spat right at you -- all with a classical soundtrack and a bottle of cheap booze."
4,good selection of bukowski's short stories,"a passage i enjoyed 'it was like any other impossible job, you got tired and you wanted to quit and then you got more tired and forgot to quit, and the minutes didn't move, you lived forever inside of one minute, no hope, no out, trapped, too dumb to quit and nowhere to go if you did quit.'good selection of work--not great but good"
5,Best short stories ever,"If you really want to get to know Charles Bukowski, this is it. Probably his best work. Grear short stories. Easy reads. Lots of dark laughs."
3,Gives a Good Overview,"Intended as an introduction to the wonderful world of orchids, thia book gives enough background to get someone interested in orchids without the use of intimidating technical jargon. As Orchids host at BellaOnline.com, I often recommend this book as a great starter for someone just starting out with orchids"
1,"Computer-generated, not living anything.Boring. Annoying music.","I rented this by mail. It wasn't described as a screen saver, but that is a very good description. Computer-generated butterflies, a CG waterfall, superimposed on a Photoshopped hill of blossoms. Very two-dimensional visuals, annoying music (not soothing or relaxing). Nothing ""living"" about it."
4,Great toy,"My five year old takes the carrier everywhere with him. The latch is a little cumbersome, but overall it is of good quality. If it can withstand everyday play with 3 and 5 yr old boys, and capture their interest months after purchase, then it's a good toy in my books!"
5,"""all in one"" swing","I LOVED THIS SWING!!! With all the baby items out there to buy for a child who really has no ""need"" for all of them this really hits all the things if you have limited space as we did. You can take the chair out of the swinging arms and have just a chair for your child to sit in and then when you want to put them in a swing just put it back in, and now you have a swing again. Now that my daughter is almost 2 we can put away the swing part and she has her own little chair to sit in."
5,Loved it...,"Reading Money Love, I was surprised to find out that some of the principles in Jerry's book were some that I already knew and believed in. The book let me know that I am on the right track. Kudos to you Mr. Gillies for writing such a fantastic book."
3,Kind of a let down,"Maybe I've just become jaded, but Quake 4 was a bit of a letdown for me. I'm a FPS fan, just read my UT04 and FEAR reviews and you'll see that, but I blew thru this game in no time. After the final cutsceen, I thought ""That's it?!"" The graphics are great, the controls are great, but there was something missing for me. Too linear and straight forward. It's not that I didn't like the game, it just didn't wow me like I thought it would. The big suprise was ruined for everyone long before the game hit the shelves, so you spend the first third of the game waiting for it to happen. It happens, you go on, no big deal."
4,Bad Brad,"I was generally pleased with the graphics and movement, but it did not seem that you had any chance to hide and defend yourself. they just come out of the wood work and it also id not seem to have a easy level so you could get used to the game play! but over all I'd recommend it to any first person shooter gamer it will keep you on your toes."
5,good game,"This edition includes Quake4 and Quake2. I haven't finished either, but so far quake2 has been excellent and quake4 has been decent. If you haven't played either of these I would recommend you buy this for quake2 and look at quake4 as an added bonus."
3,Doom3 Clone Delivers Decent Gameplay,"Probably what increases the replay value of this game is its multiplayer component with a decent amount of servers and a smooth enough multiplayer experience to keep you coming back for more. While the single player campaign offers nothing new from its engine's predecessor, Doom3, it does offer some Quake 2 fans another adventure following a similar storyline and chronology. If you enjoyed the horror of Doom3 and the story of Quake II, then Quake 4 is a good follow-up. However, gamers who aren't familiar with either won't find anything that impressive from this FPS other than an average multiplayer experience."
3,Great graphics and weapons,"Nice game, fun to play, great graphics, poo poo online gaming community.All I purchased this game for was online play. I don't really care for the single player stuff.As it turns out, the online community for this game doesn't really exist. No matter when I try to play, there are usually only a few games going at any given time.If you are looking for something with a great online community to play against, this is not the game for you."
4,Like quake 3...alot like quake 3,A little more eye candy but way too much like the predecessor. Worth a shot.
4,Really fun,"Great shooter, lots of weapons and vehicles and some really tough levels.Doesn't have the same visual quality as FEAR or HL2 but good enough to make you want to play it again. Can't wait to try it on the hardest setting!"
3,What happened?,"I just bought a new Dell XPS 700 so when I got this game I wanted to be blown away, but that didn't happen. After playing FEAR I guess not many first person shooters can come close to that. Do yourself a Favor and skip this game. The story line is good but that is all it has going for it. Half the time I spent walking around in circles and not getting anything done. I've played it three times and I can't get over how poor the graphics are compared to FEAR they came out at about the same time. I guess the producers just wanted to rest on the Quake name. They could have done better. That being said if you like FPS than buy it, but don't expect a FEAR like game. Three Stars."
1,Wish I hadn't Bought It,"I had to reboot twice to get this installed. 'Way too much work for a so-so game. Pretty graphics, boring gameplay. Shoot-it-up, fine. I started shoot-em-ups with the original Wolfenstein. It was immeasurably better than this. I wish that it was the old 'try-before-you-buy' days. I wouldn't have bought. Find another...better would be easy."
4,Dimitri is right,"I'm going to make a small review here. Quake 4 is an enjoyable FPS game for us SMART players. The graphics are highly reminiscent of Doom 3 but at a slightly more modified rate. The gameplay is fun as hell. Everything else is just good to the very least.The only drawbacks in this game are the high system requirements and it has a few bugs. In the case of the Xbox 360 version, the players are screwed with even more drawbacks. However, in the PC version, we can thankfully download some patches to fix the bugs in the game.Overall, a great but not perfect game. The PC version is better than the 360 version. Oh, and don't listen to the reviewers who give Quake 4 low ratings; they're either stupid Halo fanatics or losers who can't play a good shooter.4.5/5"
5,Superb Music and Story Telling,"As a fan of Martin's music for many years, I didn't know what to expect when I first purchased this album. At the time I purchased this album, I had only really paid close attention to his album Golden Vanity (now long out of print), and after one listening to this album I was hooked. Martin's guitar playing speaks for itself, and the stories contained within the songs are superb. The music contained on this album is deeply rooted in traditional music and will keep the listener begging for more. Do yourself and favor and buy this album."
4,Why dismiss an awesome collection of bugalu?!,"I've had no trouble whatsoever with the sound on this collection. There is so much CLASSIC material here that I still haven't absorbed it all. A lot of rarities too: Just to take a single example, the hard-to-find Grupo Folklorico's 'Anabacoa'. How can you go wrong with killer tracks and old skool grooves from the likes of Pete Rodriguez, Charlie Palmieri, Ralph Robles, the Lebron Brothers, Bobby Valentin, Tito Puente, the Fania All-Stars, Ismael Rivera, Joe Cuba, Celia Cruz, Willie Colon, Ray Barretto and the Gilberto Sextet. AND MORE! Worth every dime and then some!"
4,Hey,"I think this album is awesome. Even though, they're just demo tracks. But has some amazing killer riffs you've never heard before. But honestly, if you're a huge DP fan, you'd get it.I saw it. Got it @ a record store. But thought it was gonna be just junk. But man, was i wrong. Blew my mind & ears how the sound was perfection. Well Done DP.\m/(>.<)\m/"
1,Slow,"For some reason this computer is Extremely slow. It takes about 6 minutes to boot, 1 minute to shut down, 90 seconds to open ITunes, 30 seconds to open Firefox browser, 15 seconds to open a file, and it hangs up constantly!If anyone knows why, I'd like to find out.This is my first Vista, although my 9th laptop, and I own another 20 desktops. Definitely considered throwing out the window at times. Frustrating!!!"
5,Special little dog...,"Our daughter received an exact shining stars yellow lab like this from some dear friends while she was in the hospital for her cancer treatments. It has been very well-loved, as well as durable. She takes it on the airplanes with her & to all of her treatments & checkups since...it gives her comfort, which in turn comforts us as well! I bought this one as a ""spare"" in case we need it or for her to give to one of her children some day. (It says not to wash it, but after as many trips as ""Henry"" as been on, the poor little dog gets a bit grungy! Besides, we try not to expose our daughter to anymore germs than necessary. I've machine washed ""Henry"" on gentle more than once & then just air dried...the washing hasn't hurt it a bit.) I marked that I love the ""fun"" value of this toy because with the imagination of this little dog's owner, it has a lot of ""fun"" value at our home!"
3,"Decent product, but could be better...","I bought this product because it was listed as hypoallergenic and will result in minimal irritation to the skin. This was not the case for me. Though it seems I am allergic to almost everything and most tapes, adhesives, and other surgical things will break my skin out, I thought this might be different. I am not trying to say this is a bad product, but I can say that it did not work for me. Overall the tape was very adhesive and worked as described."
5,Fabulous Story -- Needs to be Reprinted!,"Spooky, enthralling, fabulous story. I read it so much when I was a kid, my copy fell apart. But I kept it with me through every move. I still have it -- minus the covers and the last page. If anyone has a copy, please post an image of the last page! I love the book, but there's no way I can afford $70-$100 to buy another copy. Publisher, please reprint! Or put it out on Kindle!"
5,Awesome book!,This book is just as good as I remembered it as an early teenager! My girls are able to really enjoy it now! They claim it is the best book they ever read!
5,Favorite Childhood Book,It took me years of searching to finally find a copy of this book. I really was lucky to get a hardback that was in excellent shape. I think this is an enchanting story that though it is filled with spine tingling moments (considering the age group for which it was written) over all it's just a well written book that offers a story that is unique. I wish some group like Disney would find such unique tales to use in thier new movies.
4,"Great model, but...","This is a great, nicely detailed model. It looks just like our real 2006 SRT8, except that I had to black out the chrome on the bumpers and our real one doesn't have the sunroof. Also, the seats and steering wheel should be black (the cream color in the model was not available), though the door panels (black on top and cream on the bottom) and instrument panel are correct."
2,Wrong Item Shipped,I did not receive the correct belt buckle but was instead sent a different buckle with the same band. I returned the item and was refunded my money without any trouble.
2,Absolutely love it but its completely crap,"My car does not come with a clock and I thought this is the best thing since sliced bread when I installed it. Autometer comes highly recommended by my frat of racing friends. I simply love the high contrast face and sleek aluminum bezel. I even custom made leds to replace the lamp so it lights up orange at night.However, the clock barely lasted 3 years. The hands just fell off, literally. For this price, which is more than even a voltmeter, I expected it to last as long as my car at least. Additionally, the clock loses 5 mins every month which is worse than my cheap watch. If you want something that lasts and keeps good time, this is not a product or brand I would recommend."
4,Recommended,"All star lineup, as usual, this time including Charlie Palmieri on several selections. Salsoul re-issue of a late 70's recording."
5,Andrew Jameson reviews Isidore Geld,"This is a specialist book for translators from Russian to English. It has examples from scientific texts, but the information contained is equally valid for informational and academic texts of all types. Most interesting are the General Omission Rules on pages 156-157 which lay out some general principles. The argument put forward by the author is that the structure of Russian academic discourse is such that, in order to carry the discourse forward, Russian inserts more ""dummy"" words and process words than is usual in English. With a little training, translators can learn to distinguish these words with confidence and eliminate them without losing the sense of the translation in English."
4,TRF returns with an m.c.A-T produced track!,"The last TRF CD single was back in Dec. 1996, so it was great to hear from TRF again.Having been busy with their concert tour in 1997, the group returned with ""Unite! The Night!"" and collaborated with Akio Togashi (aka m.c.A-T) and what a wonderful collaboration it was.In true m.c.A-T fashion, it was like another dose of adrenalin to the music of TRF.The group needed a fresh shot of something new and being a fan of the music of Akio Togashi, it was definitely a surprise to get something different.For years, we have gotten used to TRF ala TK style but here was a TRF song done in m.c.A-T style.The music video also brought everyone together and became another heavily choreographed music video featuring a lot of dancing.The coupling song ""Realize"" was written by DJ KOO and featured a mix by EDDIE DELENA."
3,not enough funny,"Very uneven and ultimately unsatisfying. Several of the comedians featured here were astonishingly unfunny. Several were very very good but we only see a couple minutes of them and then they're gone. Some on the other hand were very funny, and yet they overstay their welcome and become tiresome. A few here are brilliant. But watching this DVD is a frustrating experience. By the end, I wished I had simply bought separate DVDs of some of the better performers like Patton, Maria Bamford, or Andy Kindler. Except that I can't find separate DVDs. Why is that? Why does someone like Maria Bamford not have her own DVD?!Three stars on the strength of the better performers presented here, although we don't see enough of them."
2,Patton Oswalt was the only reason for watching this.,"Most of the comedian were just crap except for a very small few. A lot of crude or corny humor. Patton Oswalt was the most hilarious but he was just pulling jokes from his previous acts. Overall, I regret wasting my time and money on this."
3,Smokey Mountain Gospel;24 Bluegrass Gospel,"I enjoy most of the recordings, but some are not my favorites. Don't know if I would purchase it again."
2,smokey,I really was disappointed in the songs. I was looking for something like the Gaithers music. Got what I ordered. Service was fast and I like the no hassel ordering process.
5,Great product.,"There weren't many product reviews, when i ordered this so i was nervous. Upon receiving the pendant i was delighted to see that it was beautiful. The number was shiny, cleanly cut, and not too big or too small. It is functional for males and females."
3,FINALLY I'VE GOT MELLOW LOVIN' BY JUDY CHEEKS,"WOW! HOW LONG I WAS SEARCHING FOR MELLOW LOVIN' BY JUDY CHEEKS. FINALLY I'VE GOT IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER THE ENTIRE COMPILATION IS NOT GOOD, THERE WAS SO MUCH TIME I'D NEVER LISTENED TO MELLOW LOVIN' BY JUDY CHEEKS ANYMORE, I WAS THIRTEEN SINCE THEN (IT WAS ON 1979). SO, WHEN I FOUND IT HERE ON AMAZON.COM, I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE OTHER TRACKS - I JUST THOUGHT I BECAME A LITTLE RICHER WHEN I FINALLY GOT THAT PRECIOUS DANCING HIT FOR WICH I WAITED SO LONG AND HOPELESSLY. THEN, IF YOU MISS THAT SONG TOO, SURELY THE BUYING OF THIS COMPILATION WILL BE WORTHWHILE."
3,An acceptable travel map,"This is an acceptable travel map but don't expect the detail or accuracy of a Michelin map to more developed countries.As examples, road F985 (to glacier jeep tour) are not included on the map; neither of the bridges south of Lagarfljot are included. Some problems might be due to the date of the map. Better maps were available in Iceland but not in the US before we left on our trip."
1,"Springfield, VA",It is an okay stuffed animal but there are plenty of stuffed animals out there. This one is nothing special.
4,Very Good Beginning Tutorial,"The bodhran is an instrument that really requires a teacher. However, for an absolute beginning this book is a great start. I do not know why a previous reviewer complained that the CD tracks are backwards or that the selections do not repeat enough.On the contrary, each selection repeats a few times and many are set to music that plays for nearly a minute each. This is one strength of the book since it allows the student to practice exercises with music. On my CD the tracts follow the book precisely. It also provides a number of songs with transcriptions. This is a big plus over other books I have seen. A player needs a various patterns to practice with music to have any hope of progressing.The one drawback is that it really does not demonstrate how to perform the ""triplet"" which is an important part of playing.Finally, this book and CD is available directly from the publisher--www.melbey.com--at a greatly reduced price from what is advertised here: $12.95"
2,Bodhran Tutor,"The beginner,s manual is at first look an ""easy to use method"", however when you try to use the accompany of the CD, the beginning is at the end. This making it difficult to get started. Also, it would be helpful if there were more repitition with each section, as well as some pause for trial after each segment, as it is a bit difficult to operate CD and drum at the same time."
1,Do not hit on the MP3 Album Link associated with this page It's Not Her : (,"I Love ""Love is Contagious"" had been looking and looking for it to load up on my IPOD. I got happy when I found this page and link to THE MP3 ALBUM. I so wanted ""Love is Contagious"" . I hit on the link and it takes me to a whole Different ""Taja"" ! so Sad that Not Even ""AMAZON"" can get it right. There is only ONE Taja and that is Taja Sevelle! I keep tell'n everbody and now I am surprised that Amazon even messed it up. Gloom, Despair and Agony on me ....."
2,Okay for a start,"I had heard ""Them"" and ""Disappear"" and wanted to see what PfR was like in the beginning, so I got ""Goldie's Last Day"". I was disappointed. Now, don't get me wrong, the album has some good songs on it, but it doesn't match up at all to any more recent albums they've done. It has a very, very strong early 90's rock sound and is produced poorly so it sounds very cheezy at times. However, some of the genius songwriting comes through it all at times, such as ""By Myself"". I would suggest only buying this album if you're a diehard fan and really just need the album to be complete, or if the album is on sale for like 5 dollars or less (I got a tape of it for 3 dollars). If you want to start listening to PfR and are looking for a good ""first album"", try out ""Them"" and then ""Disappear"". ""Them"" is better when it comes to the music but ""Disappear"" is produced alot better (like a million times better), although both are alot better and more mature than ""Goldie's Last Day""."
5,Everywhere I go...,"People ask me about this camera. I have had this camera for over a year now and I am still very happy with the still pictures and video that I get with this very pocket size camera. It's looking a little worn from sharing the same pocket with car keys and coins, but it still performs like new. Battery life is real good. I carry a spare (the size of a book of matches) but is usually late in the day before needed. Macintosh users will like it because stills and video import automatically to iPhoto. No hassles! The dock keeps it charged and ready for action. For it's size it can't be beat!"
3,No power supply?,"I wish I had read the one other customer reveiw. For $70, you would think they would have been nice enough to include a power supply with it. Also, no directions are shipped with it, so make sure you read the Amazon webpage for instructions. Anyways, it is now off to Radio Shack to try to pick up a 5 volt AC to DC power supply."
5,An excellent reference book for Excel users,"As a advanced Excel user, this book is perfect for me, as I can usually look up exactly what I want to do. I've been able to find the answer to every possible Excel question I've had in this book, and it has been invaluable in terms of saving me time!This book has a great chapter on advanced work with formulas that is great for solving all kinds of problems. The book covers just about everything you'd want to look up about Excel. I think a beginner could easily start learning Excel with this book. Intermediate to advanced users will likely find this book a very helpful reference. The examples and screenshots that are provided are really helpful when you want to try out a feature.I highly recommend this book, as it's been a huge lifesaver!"
3,Somewhat useful,"The information is mostly there, but I found the design, presentation, and organization made accessing the information too difficult."
4,Excellent Paleo Reference,"A very good reference guide for Paleo items. This is an area that needed attention. The author, Mr. Hothem, admits that most of the artifacts featured are East of the Rockies. This was very disapointing for those of us out West, as we too have numerous Paleo sites and artifacts. I still enjoyed the read, which featured excellent photographs. I also believe that there could have been more details in the introduction sections of each area of study. Overall, I would highly recommend this text to all artifact collectors."
4,Paleo artifacts,"Covers all classifications of Paleo, transitional paleo and related tools. Not enough western stuff for me. Hundreds of great pics, I have not counted, maybe a thousand. More clovis than you can shake a stick at. Very very few obvious fakes.Well worth the little bit of money. Gives history when available, CoA's issused, auction prices when applicable. Best book out there for Paleo."
5,Paleo-Indian Artifacts: Identification & Value Guide,"Being a collector of Indian artifacts and coming from a family of the same, I think this book is awesome. It is informative and, with the pictures and values given, makes a great resource for the information I was looking for. I had great fun looking up and matching the pictures to the artifacts that I had found in our area of Wyoming. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in artifacts."
1,Truely a Plea for Your Money,"I was completely dissapointed in this book. On the pro side: it has a lot of pretty pictures and is hardbound. That is about it. It has no technical merit, nor is there any organization to it. It is simply a mosaic of photographs many of which are subjective as to whether they are truley paleo or not, and they do not represent all paleo tools equally. You will have to work to find examples of redstones here. It may be suitable as a coffee table nicknack, but as a reference or good read....Zzzzzz."
2,Mistakes,"As previous critiquer noted there is an error in the book RIGHT OFF THE BAT! Could ANYONE have proofread this and missed it? It made me not trust the rest of the book, valid as it might be."
3,Don't pinch your fingers,"It looks great and cleans easy. The straps work well, but the clasps are really hard to open and close and it's very easy to pinch your fingers. It hurts! They should redesign these. Otherwise we love it."
5,Beautifully sung,Steve Green does it again with his wonderful voice that he uses for the Lord. It really is quite evident that he loves the Lord in his expression with his songs. I've enjoyed listening to his music for several years and none of his music will you be disappointed with!
3,cute at first...,"I really love this phone charm its very cute, however, the ring that connects the panda to the string broke and i had to replace it also the paint is comming off of his face so much so that the eyes and nose have connected into one big black circle. The paint on the body is perfect it looks brandnew there. i would recommend getting this if you change ur phone charms often because then it will last longer. overall even with all the flaws i still love it."
5,Interesting look back in a time long gone,"Thurber Texas included people from many countries that came to a small town in Texas for work and to make a better life for them selves.As the railroads need for coal went away the people also went away.This is a classic book that tells of a time past,a industry in decline,and the way of the company town.I am from this area and for many years I drove past the smoke stack near the interstate and wondered what it was and why it was there.This books reveals the history of this area and gives good insight into a way oif life gone forever.I can reccomend this book to history buffs and people from this area of Texas with the question ""I wonder what that smoke stack is doing there?For history buffs a 9.8 out of a 1"
3,O Snap Kit Police Station,"This police station is very nice looking and adds a nice touch to my grandson's O guage train set. However, it really needs to be glued together to not fall apart."
3,Plasticville,"Judging by the other review, I lucked out with my particular building. I had some difficulty putting it together, but this was one of the few Bachmann buildings that I am able to put together and take apart each year with the use of tape or any other adhesives (the fire station, diner, and cathedral are of the other ones I am able to do this with, anything with two floors needs glue)."
3,Not bad but not my favorite,The jell like candy is covered with refined sugar; it is a little too much for my tastes but not bad.
4,I like these,"These are awesome, I had these a long time ago, and I loved them. I hadn't had them in a long time, so I came on here, and bought some. Tastes awesome, but takes a long time to ship. :("
2,A disappointment,"I found this version of Turkish Delight chewy, almost to the point of rubbery. It was a disappointment. The overall flavor was acceptable. However, with Turkish Deight, the texture matters a great deal."
3,All Show-No Go,"Product is beautiful in appearance, but falls short on performance as a heat retaining thermos. I filled the carafe with boiling hot water for several hours, then replaced it with hot coffee. The coffee was at the ""luke warm"" stage in less than three hours. The manafacture claims it will keep beverages hot for up to 12 hours. A ""stretch"" to say the least."
1,Would've been awesome,took this thing camping for the first time using this chair. One of the four foot posts that hold it up cracked and broke rendering the chair uselss. We had 4 other similar chairs that have been used many times before and since. Horrible quality.I was very excited to use this chair as the design is great. Too bad its a POS>
5,"Great book, BUT IT'S NOT IN SPANISH!","I bought this e-book because I very much like the writings of José Rizal, and the background of his life and heroic death. Everything is OK, except the fact that this book IS NOT in Spanish. Rizal's writings are interesting not just for the contents but for the Filipino Spanish too."
5,Philippine Mind set,To read Rizal (his books) is to gain a clear insight into the condition of the Philippines prior to American intervention. Rizal was executed by the Spainish prior to the Spanish-American War. He was truly a gifted man and one seeking a peaceful solution to a very tense situation of growing nationalism and colonial control by Spain.
2,Tassel Making,"I totally agree with Cora. As a complete novice I found the pictures and instructions very hard to follow. The pictures are too small to see the detail (no, my eyesight is normal) and, as an example, the instructions for making a ruff give no explanation about what to do with the thread - a critical element! I worked it out for myself but with no help from the book.I would agree that the book contains many inspirational ideas but on the whole it was a disappointment."
3,For soccer fans everywhere!,"Whether you play, coach,referee or are just a fan of soccer, this book is a must read. It takes you from his playing days to his foray into coaching carrying a tin of paint at Hartlepool to ""spruce the club up"" to his wildly successful campaigns into European football eventually winning everything. His story telling, personality and humour are contagious. Once I'd received the book from Amazon in a very timely manner, I couldn't put it down. Enjoy."
1,stinks,could not be more boring. no modern child would sit through this book. wasted the cash for christmas. My six year old said to give it away.
5,Belly dance music with an Aborigine twist,"The drum solos on this recording are suitable for bellydancing. They are more interesting than drum solos in general are because of the didgeridoo accompaniment, which creates an interesting mood. This CD is enjoyable for listening to as background music as well."
5,Start point book,"Apart from being a great book for all kind of reader, it was, for me (eight years ago!), a start point and it was probably the cause I focus my career nowadays in these small insects. It's quite nice for a child (then better with adult, not to read alone) or young people interested in natural sciences."
4,Buy It For The Pictures,"This is a good book despite being about Wilson and H?lldobler wandering around the world finding ants. Actually, the book doesn't know what it is. Sometimes, it's about Wilson finding army ants in his yard in Decatur when he was ten; sometimes, it describes species that force larvae to vomit cocoon silk (by squeezing with mandibles) to help build nests out of leaves and species where the queen nourishes herself on the blood of her babies just like science writers do. There are plenty of nice pictures, and it's well worth the read for the nasty things the ants do to each other, if nothing else."
4,King of Cool revisited,"It's always been a mystery to me why Lee Hazlewood is not recognized as one of the big songwriters of our times. His songs are full of pathos, lonesome cowboys & femme fatales and Lee got the voice to get away with it. This is the best compilation I've heard of him, it includes his own versions of the hits he wrote for Nancy Sinatra (""These Boots are made for walking""; ""So Long Babe"")as well as some rarer tracks from his 60's albums for MGM.On ""Summerwine"" & ""Sand"" he duetts with here Suzy Jane Hokom, as opposed to the later versions he did with Nancy. My personal favourite would be the haunting coming-of-age ballad ""My Autumn's Done Come"". Sadly his masterpiece ""Some Velvet Morning"" is missing, but this is definitly a great introduction for people who are not yet familiar with this forgotten genius."
4,Sin City II,Received poorly packaged. Items such as this need to be shipped securely in shipping box. Item was damaged and had to order a replacement since it was a gift.
1,Bandai Entertainment recall,"I encountered the same problems as with all the other folks around here. Even though I got a replacement disc from a very prompt response by Amazon, it still didn't play.So I tried using different players and even my computer to watch this DVD but the final chapters of the disc is just not playable. I even tried downloading a freeware player thinking it might solve the problem. It somewhat did the trick but the performance was very choppy to say the least.After browsing the web, I discovered that there was a manufacturing error regarding this DVD title (along with 3 other titles). Bandai entertainment has confirmed a recall and is willing to exchange already purchased disc with newly replicated ones. [...].I hope this helps a lot of frustrated folks out there a bit."
2,Go get FINAL Destiny--The Director's Cut,"I brought 3 of these Disk. All of them have problems. They do seem to work of a Toshiba DVD player, none of my others. That being said here is the review.The writers of this series thought they were allowed an additional 10 episodes. Many items were left out including the upgrade to the Atakasuki, the transfer of half the crew from the Arch Angel to the Eternal, and the final peace agreement between the plants and Orb/Earth Alliance. The final 2 chapters were very choppy. I was able to buy FINAL DESTINY the Director's Cut and it was a bit better. I will not ruin the actual ending for you but the final several scenes were very different which includes Athrun in the final confrontation. What also is important in the director's cut is some very important CLOSURE for Shinn including the hand shake between Kira and Shinn. I hope this episode will be release in an English version in an corected Disk 12."
1,Last episode dose not work,"All of the episodes are great, exept for the fact that you cant even watch the last one. When you finish the 49th episode the disk just stops working. Bandai was stupid enough to not make sure the final episode of a great anime even plays corectly!!!!!!!! Buy this at your own risk, if i were you i would wait for them to fix their stupid mistake."
1,Gundam seed Destiny 12,This DVD does not work. You can only play up to episode 49... Episode 50 does not work why is this happn?
4,Gundam Seed Destiny Volume 12 DVD,"Only one problem - the I received a first release, there was a recall of DVD's by Bandai Entertainment - recording defect with the last episode. The DVD was replaced by Bandai after about three weeks.Not knowing of the defect and recall, Amazon replaced the disk once, but could not replace the second (still defective disk)"
2,"Good, but Clearly not Worth the Wait","Upon finally receiving a working replacement disc from bandai I was able to watch the last 4 episodes. I started really amped and then that excitement slowly drifted into disappointment. The first episode on the disc was a cleverly disguised clip show episode,which I managed to overlook since I just wanted to get to the final battle, leaving the 3 episodes left to tie everything up, however the last episode was a huge dissappointment. The battle was ended and everything, but it felt as though no one learned anything in the end, especially Shin who spent the whole 50 episodes incredibly deluded. Not only that but we don't get to see the aftermath of battle, tie that in with Cagali only getting a few seconds of screen time in the entirety of the final volume with no speaking lines, and I'll tell you it was an awful way to end a series. I only hope they do one last thing for this series tie everything up for after the battle."
1,"Bad disc, no final plus epsiode","It is not amazon's fault, they promptly replaced my disc but it is still bad. I give this DVD 1 star because of another reason: it does not come with the final plus, which is the director's cut of the last episode. It could have easily fit into the DVD, but Bandai decided to milk this franchise and release it in 4/08 as a seperate DVD and charge the same price as a 4-episode disc."
3,Try giving it a little TLC.,"I bought the stand-alone disk not the special edition, but it wouldn't play in a Bluray, HD-DVD, or an up-converting DVD player. After I ran the disk through a Disk Doctor polisher/cleaner it worked fine. I think the disks were contaminated during the manufacturing process and just need to be cleaned."
1,dosen't work,"Yep i just got my copy of the DVD today and it dosen't work, i hope the recall goes fast, i have no idea what to do with the disk now, also the gundam seed collection one is also defective , the 5th disk does not read at all, just like this one....i sent a e-mail to amazon and i hope this gets fix soon, i dont want to send it back for a replacement that will do the same thing."
1,Wont work =(,"Yes, i am also having the same problem, tryed to play it on 3 computers plus a Dvd player, but still wont work, it lags my computer for awhile,I played on Dell XPS 420 Wont work for some reason, Dell XPS 1330 a laptop, it wont read and inspriron 1530 wont work either, and when i played it on my DVD player it gives me an error ><, i was waiting for all these weeks just to get a hold of GSD vol 12 >_>"
1,Unplayable; recall announced by manufacturer,"From Bandai's web site:January 9, 2008 (Cypress, CA) - Bandai Entertainment Inc. announced today that a number of its January titles were defective as a result of a duplicator's error which created playability issues on some DVD consoles and personal computers. The titles in question are: Gundam Seed Destiny Vol. 12 regular and special editions, Eureka Seven Vol. 11, Flag Vol. 2, and My Otome Vol. 4.(Read more at www.bandai-ent.com.)"
1,Mobile Suit Gundam 12: Seed Destiny,this is the last DVD and its not working... iv been waiting forever for vol 12 and i got it at best buy n the damn thing is not working. why? why bandai? do you do this again i thought they would have learned there lesson
4,Get the Booze out...,"there's something about certain groups that lead you do things. with this record, it leads me to the bottle. not saying the booze helps the music, but it doesn't hurt it. this is a solid record, that's worth the money. good ol' drinking tunes. That rock, and that roll. enjoy 4 stars"
2,Sorry I Read This,"This book was a waste of time for me to read.Like most, ""yay rah single girl"" books, it operates on the FALSE assumption that single women in their twenties and early 30's have amazing, complete lives.Life isn't Sex and the City and a lot of single girls (past college age) don't have a huge gaggle of single girlfriends to hit the town with every weekend. Most of us aren't yet settled into our careers and our friends have moved all over the place to pursue careers, grad school...etc.It's hard to just ""love yourself and your life while you wait for Mr. Right"" while your life is so full of uncertainties. Books written for single women always assume that you are awesome and have this great career and group of wonderful, supportive friends. That's just not the case for so many single women out there.Unless you have a great job, live in a fun city, have a group of amazing girl-friends, and have no kids, this book has nothing to offer."
4,Common sense for single girls who already know the deal.,"Schefft preaches to the choir in a book that is full of advice longtime single girls already know. However, if you have always had boyfriends, this book is WORTH it. It gives some heads up to situations you never thought about as anything other than typical. Nope, don't settle, Jen says! And get your parents to shhh about dating pressure. This book is for a girl who might need an extra confidence boost."
2,Ill-served by the editor,"A first time author, particularly, needs a good editor. What happened here? Aiming for a ""conversational"" style is fine, but titling a chapter Tell Mom -- to %$#* Off or calling a date an A..hole is not conversational, it's vulgar.Add in the contradictions, repetitions, padding, grammattical lapses and even typos, and the sum total is a poorly-constructed, poorly written and poorly edited book, Part Two, Chapter Six: Stop Believing You Can't Do Better"
1,change title to Can't Commit,"This girl will find any excuse to not commit. She failed at two Bachelor/ette shows and blew off the Apprentice guy. She is desperate to get famous. It's not a problem to stay single, but don't lie and say you want to get married, but can't find the right guy. Sounds like Liberace!"
3,FLAWED...but still worth it .,"The only complaint I have is WHY SO MANY VERSIONS OF ""Closer To Heaven"" ??? The only SAPPY Pigface tune Ive EVER heard and they do it 4 or 5 times??? Its done well and all but still...Maybe if it was ""Closer To Hell"" I'd like it, who knows. HOWEVER, ""King Of Negativity"" is absolutely wicked! Worth the full price of the disc...that depends what the ""full price"" is I suppose? I got damn lucky and got my copy at a pawn shop for two buck$, and it just happens to have God's ...ooops, I mean Martin Atkins autograph on the cover. BOTTOM LINE: Martin Atkins is an incredible artist that knows more about music than most people on this planet ever will, so I dont think he's capable of doing crappy music. With that in mind buy the disc and piss off, aspholes! Peace.P.S. Check out ""The Damage Manual"", another kick-ass band w/Atkins/Walker/Connely & the Mighty JAH WOBBLE on bass"
3,"As expected, but not enough","The meals are what you expect, one pot dishes with ity bitty bits of frieze dried everything. My only complaint is that they should say single serving, not two person meals."
2,Bleech.....,"I didn't care for any of the meals that came in this sampler. They were very bland compared to other brands I've tried. They are lower in sodium than most freeze dried rations and that's a plus, however, I think it's probably why they are so bland."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"This was required reading by my manager. I'm always skeptical in those situations, but it came highly recommended. And now that we've all read it and tried to implement the suggestions, I can say there has been a noticeable difference in the way each employee approaches work. People seem more motivated and excited about their jobs than before. I think every business could benefit from Coonradt's ideas which inspire and inject fun into the often-mundane job experiences."
5,Good companion book to her husband's book,"I had already read the biography of John Paton, and found it very inspiring. This book is letters written from his wife to her friends and relatives while they were on the mission field on Aniwa in the New Hebridies. In the days long before internet, email, long distance calls and such, Margaret W. Paton gave a up a lot for the message of Christ. The only sad thing is that they sent their children away to school (common for missionaries of the time). I wish they had thought to bring a tutor from their home country instead. I liked this book so much I ordered two as Christmas presents.."
2,"works, properly","works, is exactly as advertised, but it's just way too expensive, found one at a LFS 2 days after receiving for 4 bucks."
5,Her True Calling!,"Her true calling! Almost all soul singers start in the church,but are ""discovered""while singing worldly music.Deniece Williams was a backgrond singer for Stevie Wonder but herbig break was from Maurice White a lead singer for EWF,producer of her 1st. album which featured ""God Is Amazing"" Like Elvis Presley her greatest success has been singing gospel music,Is the this best collection of those songs? YES!"
5,This item was a gift and the receiptant was elated with the CD.,I gave this CD as a gift and the person was elated and pleased with every selection on the CD.
1,They Say,"I bought this CD thinking the song, ""They Say"" was one of the songs. It wason the CD, but not the version with Phillip Banks, so I was disappointed."
3,For BeeGees' Fans To Sleep By!,I love the BeeGees' music and find this album to be a special treat. I can hear their music as performed by a full orchestra without vocals. Very soothing and fun. Great addition to my collection.
3,Decent double feature,"If you into mummy's, then this is the disc for you. Some chills but idea of mummy chasing and catching people when he has little use of one arm and leg is a little silly."
2,See the original,"These two films are really rather poor. Even though they are mercifully short (Hand is 67mins and Tomb is 60mins) they have few redeeming qualities. The acting is at times rather wooden and in the case of the Mummys hand two of the heros are vaguely reminisent of Abbott and Costello. Whether this was intended I very much doubt.The Mummy itself is a pretty clever makeup creation (no CGI remember) and there are one or two moments in both films where the closeups of the mummys face must have been pretty scary back in the 1940's. However any tension created is soon lost because the films are largely confined to one or two sets and the plots are pretty contrived and disbelief settles in quite quickly when you realise that the Mummy can only walk at 1.5 miles an hour. Naturally the characters in the film don't seem to grasp this important fact!See the Boris Karloff original, which is one of the great Universal horror films."
1,Mummy's Hand Review,"Wallace Ford ruins this movie. He plays a comedic role as Babe and is featured so heavily, he turns Mummy's Hand into a bad comedy rather than a scary movie. One of the worse entries in the Universal horror frachise."
5,the Best of Daryl Coley,Some of Daryl Coley's Best Works. He has other Songs that was not on there but i am quite pleased with this CD
5,I am very satisfied.,"I'm from Brazil and I received the product, I am very satisfied. I was lucky to not be taxed. I recommend to all. :)"
4,Exciting,Very nice season. I felt they gave Dixon a big part in this season so I was happy about that. It was very interesting too!
3,Its a DVD,"It's a DVD I don't expect anything great or huge when I order a DVD, just simply that it works without skipping."
5,Wonderful,"His best book by far. Well-written, good dialogue, fully-realized characters, nice setting and backstory. A literate mystery which is a rare combination...buy and enjoy!"
1,Complete waste of a lot of money,"I own several Mystic Moods LP recordings on vinyl and I love them, they set a wonderful romantic mood. Unfortunately they are not available on CDs.These are not anything like those recordings, completely boring unless you are an insomniac. If these will not put you to sleep nothing will. Better than a dozen sleeping pills although maybe less expensive. See and hear them before you buy. I wasted my money. If it was not such a PITA to do so I would return them."
2,I think,"I think that previous movies had the gyonsi glide more than an out and out hop. And those were comedies, this is supposed to be taken more seriously.Also the hopping zombie and the hopping vampire are really different. The hopping vampire is what you get when the hopping zombie gets out of control. At least I guess that's the way it works. They also dress differently and have different abilities and weaknesses.The hop scoffers seemed to like the movie, so I'm not sure what the problem is.Me, I thought it was a little silly."
2,ZOMBIES INTO VAMPIRES???,"I don't know if this tale is based of Chinese folklore or if they just screwed up trying to copy American horror film. Zombies can become vampires if they eat enough human flesh. You can recover from a zombie bite, but will turn into a vampire if bitten. The zombies are waxed cover so there is no decay. And rather than drag a leg behind them, they bounce up and down as if they are on a pogo stick. The vampire engages the vampire hunters with typical anti-gravity martial art moves.There are 4 guys, their master and a girl and none of it is good. The translation was hip. Now the idea this is ""destined to become a martial arts/horror classic"" has somehow slipped under the radar for 10 years.No nudity, sex, or swearing. Fairly kid safe."
2,A stinker,"What a waste of film. Especially with a name like Tsui Hark appearing on the case. I wouldn't mind the illogical premise ( anyone who dies is a potential zombie<!?> which over time would transform into a vampire ), as long as it delivers on the action-- but unfortunatly, it exuberates an already silly plot, which in itself is jarring and lacking in direction. The narrative doesn't have the same charming aimlessness of say, Time & Tide, and features truly corny comic moments. The action is standard wire-fu, and it's compentantly done, though there's really nothing that stands out here. The monsters look like crap ( no, really ), and move like they've been out in the sun too long. Don't waste your time on this-- for some real good fun go get Vesus instead."
2,give me a break,"This movie sounds promising, but is pretty horrible.When I saw tsui harks name I grabbed it, dont make the same mistake.The story is weak,the effects are eeeeaaaaaakkkkkkk! but it does have one of the goofiest things ive ever seen in a movie....bouncing zombies.Buy your copy today!"
2,Hop Schmop,"Hop Schmop. It's a dumb movie. I can't believe reviewers defending the classic tradition of the hopping zombie. I mean are these people typing that with a straight face?You've got these zombies going around hopping and what we are supposed to NOT LAUGH? Okay childrens, sit very still as we watch the legendary hopping zombie of Calavaras Couty. I am so cracking up right now just thinking about it.If you want a true classic Asian horror movie, you want the impossible to find ""Kung Fu Exorcist"" with Kathy Leen. KFE predates Close Encounters of the Spooky Kind by at least 4 years."
1,makes no sense,"This movie has no central point. It jumps back and forth between the war between humans and vampires and the race for the gold. And what do they mean by VAMPIRES? The monsters don't even look like blood suckers. They look like grotesque zombies, which supposed to turn into vampires after eating humans. Well, they ate plenty of flesh but did not turn into vampires.I watched it untill the end hoping that it will get better but it didn't. Waste of time and money."
1,waste of money,"I expect a lot more more moviemaker such as Tsui Hark, especially I am a fan of his earlier films "" Once Upon a Time In China (kungfu-master)"" series (starring Jet Li). The story is mediocre, on top of that the music kind of kill the mood, where most of the time the music is contrasting the movie.the storyline kind of jumpy, especially in the first half.the actions is very amateurish. My girlfriend, whom I just introduced to ""Once Upon a Time in China (OUTC)"" could not believe that it was made by the same guy, especially the OUTC were made before the vampire hunter."
4,My youth revisited,"When Bruce Lee and Co. hit the shores of the US in the early 70s I was a gung ho 10yr old.Loved 'kung fu' movies.However,whenever someone would start flying around in a film,I'd regret the dollar I spent to get in.Over 30 years later I find myself watching a 'kung fu' horror movie with the very thing (the flying around,etc.)that I once detested prevalent.But this time it's different:the flying fits in because the movie is about the supernatural so I don't mind.It has a decent story.The acting is good,the scenery is beautiful,nice special effects,and best of all-a look at the legendary Vampire,Asian style instead of the same old eastern European version.Big difference.If you're not going to buy it at least rent it and give it a try."
2,Skip This One,"I rented this one, but found it to be a waste of time. The fight scenes were decent, but the vampire was more like a severly decayed corpse. I found it to be a letdown."
1,Can't believe Tsui Hark lent his name to this ...,Tsui Hark is an amazing producer and director who has trained many a great action director such as John Woo. But this film? Ouch! Confusing plot. Stupid dialog. Laughable zombies (they hop). Maybe it was meant to be a comedy.Check out the 'Once Upon A Time in China' set of DVDs with Jet Li for a better idea of what Tsui Hark is capable of and stay from this turkey! The HK equivalant of Plan 9 from Outer Space.
2,very strange,"I read about this in fangoria magazine and saw tsui hark's name on it,so I grabbed it.The box has a great description on the back,but its not even worth seeing on cable.There are plenty of fights,some gore,plenty of stupidity.It has zombies that bounce like tigger on his tail.BOUNCE.The vampire king zooms through the air like a rag doll on a wire,he never speaks and is mainly a pest with zero purpose.This movie is a major dud and I want my money back,I had no idea it would be this goofy."
5,Best cup of tea - ever,This tea maker is phenomenal! It is amazing how much different a cup of tea tastes when it's brewed at the right temperature for the right amount of time. No bitterness. The true flavor of the tea comes through - consistently. Well worth the money.
1,Waste of good tea,You cannot set this up the night before as the the tea gets steeped overnight and the next day after brewing tastes stale. I learnt that after a couple of bad cups of tea.The loose tea setting does not brew the black tea long enough or hot enough so I had to switch to the bagged tea setting.I have had this for the past 2 months approx and now the water reservoir is dripping which means I cannot fill that the night before .The water is also not heating to the correct brewing temp and the tea is cold and stale. This has more visual than gustatory appeal and since I use it once a day that has worked out to a very expesive cup of tea! Not recommended.
4,A fine cup of tea,The Zarafina makes a fine cup of tea. The only downside is that it is not dishwasher friendly and it is a little more work to put together but the final product is well worth it.
4,Zarafina Tea Maker,"PROS:-multiple settings for brewing different tea types (white, green, black) and different strength levels (strong, medium, light). If, for example, you select green tea, it will heat the water to a temperature typically appropriate for brewing green tea.-easy to use-nice design-can be used with loose leaf tea and tea bagsCONS:-only will brew two 8oz cups of tea at a time-has to be handwashed; not dishwasher friendly-water seems to get trapped in the bottom of the tea basketOVERALL: I would recommend this product to someone who really enjoys loose leaf tea. I'm not sure that it would be worth it if you only drink from tea bags from the grocery store. But a nice product overall."
5,Convenient and Classy,"I really love this tea maker! I shopped around for a long time looking for a quality automatic tea maker and finally decided on this unique combination of convenience and style. It only makes two cups at a time and you need to consume the tea immediately after brewing because there is no warmer for the teapot to sit on. You have to play around with how much leaf to use based on your personal preference, but once you've done that it steeps the tea perfectly and then dispenses it directly into the ceramic teapot. You do have to be careful not to get water on the implements when cleaning the steeping insert and be sure that it is dry before you put it back in. But once you are aware of that, it is no big deal. Use the ceramic tray for a very classy way to serve the tea. This is a product of very thoughtful engineering! I highly recommend!"
5,Great device,"Very useful machine. Easy to clean, has settings for different types of tea (green, oolong, black, white, herbal), bag or leaves, concentration (i.e. strong, medium or mild), and works fully automatic. Looks well built and trendy. I use it every day now.The flavor of the tea prepared with this machine is significantly better than using tea bags and a microwave, it tastes like a properly prepared tea. I have bought different types of tea and tea from different locations (i.e. chinese, english, indian, arabic) and it works with all of them.This is an ideal device for anyone who wants to have good quality tea at work. Using tea leaves in your office is a mess without this machine, but with Zarafina it is a very clean process. It also can stay on your desk because it dos not take much space, it is a fun gadget to show to your coworkers!"
5,Purchased for my office,"This item works well and makes great tea. I keep it in my office to brew tea daily while I'm working and it makes tea making easy and enjoyable. I love that it has settings for various types of loose teas, which allows me to put some silver needles in the loose tea container, move the dial to white tea, and forget about until later when I come back to pour a cup of perfect tasting tea."
2,it broke!,"The water heating element broke after just two weeks and ""made"" cold tea for us. I've had previous bad experiences with expensive electronics' water heating elements breaking (carpet steamer - two of the same model) that I didn't want to chance it on a replacement. The amount of tea it makes (two *small* cups) is not enough for what our household drinks in the morning either. I did like that it would adjust the temperature and not burn the tea, but I also would have enjoyed having a built-in timer so I could set it up at night for the morning. Oh well, it was nice looking as others have said."
3,Doesn't quite make the mark,"While I'm offended by the previous reviewers pompous tone I must agree with him that the water really must be boiled to get the most out of your tea. Your best bet is to get an electric kettle and a pretty tea pot. Electric kettles boil water more quickly than the stove top variety and brewing loose tea in a pot will give you the best flavor.So, Jeremy, no need to turn this into an anti-American thing. We are different, that does not make us lesser. There are plenty of Americans who appreciate a truly good cup of tea and many who couldn't care less. I've had some pretty bad cups of tea in Britain! And as for bad tea in American restaurants - Americans simply do not order it so most restaurants are not prepared to provide ""the good stuff."" Live with it."
3,"Good, but has it's flaws","I had one of these for about 1.5 years (it is currently not working). It was fun and I enjoyed the tea it made.Pro:quick and easy to brew a small amount of teaseveral settingsone - two cups (good for me)Cons:Use it right away, or it gets coldonly two actual temperaturesThe teapot lid has no indentations and the lid can be very difficult to open - especially if it is moist. It slips.at $99 it is expensiveBelow $50, I will replace it; but until that time, I will use something else."
3,"Entertaining, but lots of trouble.","Yes, it's fun to watch the basket with the leaves plunge into the hot water chamber and yes, it makes a very good cup of tea. However, it doesn't make enough for a group and there are an awful lot of moving pieces that have to be cleaned for two small cups of tea. I would not buy it if I'd known everything I do now."
3,Disappointed,"I had been looking forward to getting this for at least 6 months before I got it. It is fairly complicated to use it but that would be ok if tea tasted better when brewed using it. Alas, it does not. If you use bags, there is a distinct boiled taste. I don't like my tea boiled, just steeped. It did work well for loose green tea so it may be that you have to use it with loose tea."
4,Good tea - what kind of plastic though?,"I have the Zarafina Tea Suite and do enjoy my daily green tea. However, with all the growing concern regarding plastics, I decided to initially email the company and ask about this. Three times. I never got an answer to my email. I decided to call instead, and was told that it's 'propriatory information', but that the plastic follows all FDA guidelines and there should be no concern. Now, I am questioning how healthy my green tea is if it comes along with some plastic contaminants! The fact that they won't disclose the type of plastic it's made out of, has me concerned. Maybe I'm just over-reacting? You decide - just wanted to throw this out there for consideration."
5,Tea making with ease,I absolutely love my tea Zarafina. It's great to find a tea maker that actually has different setting for different teas like it should be. It's super easy to use - and perfect for one person (a larger model would be nice for some - but tea brewing is best in small batches). The instructions are simple and it's pretty quite over all (although as mention in other reviews a alarm that it's done would be nice) I drink a wide variety of teas and this machine makes it so simple.Over all it does what it states and makes it easy to brew a wide variety of teas. It's perfect for a tea lover. Adjustable settings are a plus. The machine is easy to clean and simple to use. Loose and Bagged teas are both usable. I love the setting for brewing strength since I tend to like most of my teas on the stronger side.On the downside of things - it is on the high end of the price scale. For some the tea pot maybe smaller than desired. But that's about it.
2,Short life,"I really enjoyed the tea suite but in just two years with very light use, the water no longer heated. Their customer supported didn't even know they were their customer support, answering for some other product name before realizing they also took care of the Zarafina Tea Suite. I was told they could give me the url to the website so I could buy another. I declined. I believe for that kind of money, they should last longer than 2 years."
3,"Brews good tea, but safety and durability are concerns","I received this as a Christmas gift a couple years ago. It has always worked well and brews delicious tea.Last night I brewed a pot of tea with no problems. I immediately brewed another and the brew cycle worked fine, however, only 1/4 c. of tea was dispersed into the pot. I emptied the tea out of the chamber, cleaned the machine and tried again to no avail. I phoned the company this morning and the tea maker has been discontinued. The agent put me on hold for several minutes and when he came back on he explained that he had been searching for a manual. He advised me to clean the unit (wash all parts and run a water cycle) which I had already done.Upon reading other reviews of the product there are also concerns about the plastic chamber containing BPA. At this point I will probably just throw it out and cut my losses."
5,"I will buy another if mine breaks, I love it!","I give this product 4 stars, I enjoy it so much, I can experiment with different teas making up my own special tea. If I know the tea is strong, I can adjust it to mild brewing, if it is a weak light tea, I adjust to strong brewing. The process is enjoyable and entertaining.Not all teas are of the same quality, if you are picky learn about all the different type of tea and experiment. Greene teas are the hardest to choose from due to the many varities, so do some research and have fun learning about teas.Another benefit is that one tea bag placed on moderate or strong saves money in that it makes two good cups of tea instead of just one cup.My only qualm is that I wish it could dispense one cup at a time and leave the second cup to stay warm for the next cup, but I still give it a 5 star rating!I love it and when this one breaks, I will replace it with a new one!Enjoy,Ponchan"
2,Zarafin tea suite,"I purchased one tea suite, it lasted exactly one year. Second one purchased lasted only 6 months. I loved using this tea maker, but they don't last, can't get parts, and too expensive to invest in another one. Have found other less satisfying tea makers. Very disappointed."
4,Like it a lot,"This is a good product. We only drink tea and enjoy the many different types and blends of loose teas. In the past, using only my electric kettle, I found it difficult to get the water temperature and steeping time right for the different types of tea. I frequently got the water too hot and steeped too long. Now our tea is perfectly brewed every time. My only complaints regard having to hand wash the components and also I would wish for the capability of making a larger amount of tea - 16 oz. only allows for one cup for my husband and myself."
3,Great Idea But VERY VERY SMALL,"This is a great idea for a product, and it works. The problem is unless your end user is two little girls doing a tea service for their dolls, the product is just too small. There is enough tea made for two small cups, and then you are just out of luck and need to start over again.What they need to do is clone this product idea in a product that is three times larger and serves an entire family or small office. That would make the pain of their setup and cleanup procedures worth doing."
3,Discontinued; parts not available,"I love this tea maker, but Zarafina has been sold and the tea maker has been discontinued. If you buy this you should know that you cannot replace the tea pot if it breaks, and it is very fragile."
4,"Breaks easily, but makes a good cup.","I had to buy a new one for my roommate after I accidentally broke it by washing it incorrectly. It does make a good cup a tea, but now I refuse to use it cause I don't want another 70 dollar mistake."
3,Heating element Failure after a few months,"I purchased this a few years ago and immediately loved the convenience and quality of the tea. However, within a few months of daily use (1-2 times/day) it just stopped working completely. Would not heat at all. I kept the tea maker away from water and used a GFI plug; was very careful about following all instructions. I was really disappointed that such an expensive tea maker would just fail.Even though it broke after only a few months, I have not been able to find another that is as convenient and works as well. I mainly drink black tea and enjoy a strong tea so I didn't have any of the problems that some others mentioned with green tea. I'm thinking about trying it again just because I can't find another tea maker that fits my needs as well."
4,Excellent Gift,I bought this Ceramic Tea Pot for my mother-in-law and she and her husband love it. They said that it is a little slow but the flavors of the teas are incredibile. They were very pleased. I would recommend this product for you or give it as a gift as I did.Thanks.S. Estep
1,Far too delicate for the real world,"While it worked it was fantastic. That was about two months. Then one day the element simply stopped heating. Everything else worked, just no heat. I never machined-washed any part of it, and always hand-toweled the heater tank. Digging around the internet it turns out this is far more common than reviews here on Amazon would suggest.It is simply unacceptable that such an expensive device can fail so quickly when ""babying"" a kitchen appliance. I'm looking now at the Breville One-Touch. With perfect hindsight I realize now I should have spent the extra $80 on a device with no negative reviews either on Amazon or the general internet. I need a looseleaf automatic machine for my office, something that can handle being a real-world appliance."
1,Pricey and complicated plus it leaks,"I've been using the Zarafina Tea Maker for several months and I find it to be an annoying piece of equipment. The first problem is that it will realistically only make one cup of tea at a time. The two cups it says on it are really small, 6-8 oz. cups. If you want a mug, it only makes 1 cup. It doesn't keep the tea warm, either. If you don't pour your tea right away, it sits in the cold ceramic pot and gets cold very quickly. The ceramic pot drips. You will have to wipe the table every time. Then it leaves a couple of tablespoons of your tea in the container unless you tip it toward the valve as it dumps into the pot after steeping. Recently, it has begun leaking under the heating mechanism and the ceramic plate under the whole machine fills up with tea. I use this in an office and I don't like having to clean up after it all the time. It's much too complicated and expensive for what it actually does and it does it badly."
5,Zarifina Tea Maker,"Easy to use and makes a perfect cup of tea. You don't have to worry about getting the water too hot and destroy the antioxidant properties of the tea, especially green tea. Another nice feature is that it bubbles periodically during the brewing cycle to mix the leaves, so you can be sure that it's never too weak or too strong. I'd highly recommend this tea maker if you're concerned about taste and getting the most health benefits out of your tea."
3,"Excellent, but ....","The best thing I like is the size. It's a small tea maker which can fit my limited kitchen counter top. The tea taste after brewing is awesome. Only one trouble is the cleaning! There's one part underneath which is flat oval shape. There are 2 parts stacking to each other. You have to seperate them apart to clean up, but it's so hard, I mean very hard to take them apart. I end up with cleaning the whole thing. I see some water in between these 2 parts which might make trouble in the future. But I don't want to hurt my fingers or my hands seperate them again."
2,limited production,I would not recommend this item for anyone who likes a full cup of tea. It makes an insuffient amount for two people to share.
3,A poorly engineered device,"I have always been a tea lover - and the ad for Zarafina, promising a perfect cup every time, caught my eye. As an 'early adopter' I paid $150 for it. The machine does make a good cup of tea but it has several annoying shortcomings:* it is small - 2 cups max, and then you have to wash it* When you do wash it, must remember to put a rubber protector onto a protruding part of tank. This is a primitive engineering solution.* I have found it 100% impossible to pour a cup of tea out of the machine without spilling some on the table. I am pretty handy with things, but the teapot is badly designed, a few drops always get on the table, and I mean always.So, after trying to use it for a few months and making 20 or 30 pots of tea, I am going to get rid of mine."
2,My list of negatives about my Zarafina,"I received this as a Christmas gift from my husband as a replacement for my Mrs Tea that finally passed away after probably 15 years of service. I agree that the Zarafina is pretty and looks nice on my counter and I will agree that it makes a good cup of tea (no better than my Mrs Tea!) but that's where my fondness ends. First and foremost it does not brew enough tea, and it takes forever! I get two cups of tea and then I'm brewing another pot, and another and another. I am a tea drinker. Give me some tea! I also do not like that there isn't a warming element. The brewed tea cools off fast and I'm forced to put the cup in the microwave to warm it up. Lastly, I use loose tea and each and every cup has major tea debri in it. Annoying. Oh, and another thing, the litlle tiny pot cannot pour without spilling. I don't care how careful you are. I'm in the process of searching for a new tea maker. I'll sell my Zarafina on eBay."
5,Zarafina Tea Maker Suite,"I was skeptical of whether this would really make ""the perfect cup"" for all tea types advertised: black, green, oolong, herbal, white, but after using the product for ~2 months, I am very pleased.The teas that benefits most from being brewed properly with the Zarafina, are white teas. White teas become horribly bitter if over brewed.I have tried all of the tea type settings and the loose versus bag setting and all perform well. I would highly recommend this product if you want the convenience of a coffee maker with the precision brew required for making ""the perfect cup"" of tea.For a lengthier review of this product by me, please see the following:[...]"
2,Struggle to clarify,"2 1/2Though the tracks do little more than supply a soundtrack to your favorite muted post-modernist high resolution documentary, their fly-over nature endures as mid-ground aesthetic."
2,Mediocre to the max,"The acting in this movie is highly questionable, the action moves slowly, the main character is just plain annoying and I wish I had those 90 minutes of my life back. No it wasn't horrible, but the film is supposedly about the chracter (Jeff Sanchez) finding himself, when I couldn't really care less who he was. As he breaks free from his shell, he is still annoying and not hot, rather than the wise butterfly the film would like him to be. Also, the film has a very B Movie quality, which doesn't really work since it's not that campy."
2,yawn!,"I kept waiting for something interesting to happen thru all the flashback and self-examination scenes. Sadly it didn't and I was glad I did not spend much for this DVD. It goes nowhere.Stereotypical over-liberal nutty parents, the fag-hag & nelly best friend. Somehow a super-hot guy from a coffee stand falls for our normal-looking, jobless, whining main character. Like Judy Tenuda would say, ""YEA...IT COULD HAPPEN!"""
3,Perfect for the sentamental metal head.,"For those of us who grew up in the '80's, jammin' to Twisted Sister, Motley, Bon Jovi, and Poison, and are NOT ashamed to admit it, this CD fits the bill. Who among us doesn't remember sitting arm in arm with our significant other, making out to ""Caught up in You"" or ""Ballad of Jayne""? I personally miss those days of BIG ballads and even BIGGER hair. As they say, if I have to explain, you'll never understand. This compilation is by no means comprehensive, but it is a small reminder of the glory that was 80's heavy metal. And hey, THEY have THEIR music, why can't WE have OURS. METAL HEADS UNITE! (and for the price, what have you got to lose?!)"
4,Cape Fear is great!,"Cape Fear is a wonderful murder flick! Nick Nolte plays a North Carolina lawyer who defended a convicted felon. He lost the case and Nolte's client Max Cady(De Niro)goes to jail. When he is released Cady terorizes Nolte and his family, Jessica Lange his wife and Julitte Lewis daughter. After being harrased and pursued by Cady enough the family escapes to North Carolina's real life location Cape Fear for and exciting climax. The film goes off course some and does kind of get boring but it really is worth it! I've liked this since I saw it for the first time when I was much youger. The theme is amazing! And De Niro's performance is not to be missed."
3,Trouble with video stream,Had trouble with video stream. The movie was fine. I was doing a review for a college course so it was convenient to get it on my computer without having to go out to a video store... but was irritated with the pauses in the streaming. since we have fast connections I don't believe the issue was on this end.
1,Horrible Movie,Jusy wanted to see a scary movie so rented this one on a recommendation. Not scary. Just disgusting. Don't bother with this one.
4,Slum Lords,"This is based on a true story of a freed con who stalks a family on welfare before raping them at the end. Several differant versions of Cape Fear exist, this is the 90s version."
2,How Can You Compare this to the Original?,"On its own, this film is alright. It has some good things, but its not fantastic. When compared to the origina 1962 version, its a different story. Its horribe! Part of the artistic vlue of the original was the difference in class between Sam and Max. In this version, Nick Nolte character is just as low and dirty and the real villain.People seem to think that more is better, but this has to much explicitness.This is an enjoyable film, but anyone who is too stupid to watch th original and compare them is just missing out on a great piece of cinematic masterpiece!"
3,Dissapointing for Robert De Niro,"Cape Fear is alright, but is dissapointing for a De Niro film. I didn't like the way we know who the killer is throughout the movie but it gives you an interesting aspect towards how things could really turn out. The final scenes at Cape Fear are awesome though, and it was about time SOMETHING exciting happened, it was pretty slow before these scenes."
2,Pales in camparison to the original,"Even though there are some VERY strong performances here, it doesn't create the tension of the original. Worse, the ending has been changed!!Stick to the original."
2,"The one Scorsese film worthy of being called ""bad""","Scorsese's remake of ""Cape Fear"" was just a poor excuse to put Robert DeNiro in a horror film. Even though the camera is excellent (as usual), the acting is simply atrocious. Nick Nolte gives one of the worst acting performances in the history of film, and only Steven Spielberg (who produced this ball of yarn) could've talked Scorsese into this mess."
5,"""Come out, Come out Wherever You Are!""~Cape Fear","Cape Fear is one of the best movies in the world! I absolutly love it! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys revenge movies, because this is the best revenge movie ever! I just loved this movie, thats all i can put into words, because this movie is just so magnificent that there are no words to describe how wonderful it is! I havn't seen the original yet, but i can't wait to see it!"
4,"""Cape Fear"" updated for a '90's audience","While serving time for a sex crime, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) discovers that his disgusted lawyer (Nick Nolte) buried evidence that could have reduced his sentence. Released after 14 years, he starts using a psychological jackhammer on Nolte and his wife and daughter (Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis) while becoming increasingly dangerous. Story and characters are expanded a bit from the 1962 version, and a terrifying performance by De Niro, but a lot of gratuitous violence and unpleasantness thrown into the mix. A nail-biter to be sure, but more and better aren't the same thing. Original stars Robert Mitchum, Martin Balsam, and Gregory Peck make cameos here."
3,"A good movie,","But don't compare it to the original; that's not fair. In some ways, they're almost 2 different films. This one has entertainment value, for sure, including DeNiro's over-the-top performance and the cameos by the original's stars. Nolte, Lange and Lewis are all OK, but ultimately not really believable in terms of the whole picture. Worth watching, but catch the original too, for sure.PS to a certain March 14 reviewer: First, learn to use English properly. Second, the original ""sucked"" to you because it didn't have enough violence or tattoos, right? Yeah. THERE's a legitimate reason....."
1,Fear This...Cause It`s That Bad,"A bad Martin Scorcese movie if there ever was one, ""Cape Fear"" starts well enough but soon falls into predictable, convulted, contrived and annoying territory. A morality play about a psycho (played by Robert De Niro) who wants to get revenge over an attourney (Nick Nolte), this movie is derivative and tremendously by-the-numbers. Disappointing, really, given that the director and actors deserved better than a poor script with a very flawed execution. The final half hour on the boat is particularly bad and insulting, delivering an unconvincing resolution. Anyway, ""Cape Fear"" has one remarkable scene, where De Niro and Juliette Lewis have a weird moment of seduction. Unfortunately, most of the movie is just a tepid and unimaginative thriller like so many others. Bland characters, average direction, uneven pacing, pretentious dialogue and unsurprising/ over-the-top cliffhangers.Avoid."
2,NOT THE BEST OF SCORSESE & DE NIRO,WE HAVE TO ADMIT IT BOTH DID MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ; HOWEVER IT MAKES YOU THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING ON A BOAT AGAIN ; JESSICA LANGE IS PERFECT ; & IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR JULIETTE LEWIS ; OK BUT NOT GREAT...
1,I Wanted to Walk Out,"Did Scorsese actually direct this film? If so, it is his turkey! Abysmal on all counts. There was nothing, not even technical ability, that interested me in this film."
5,Deniro is scare-Rey!!!,"The movie arrive quickly and in excellent shape. Though its an old movie, WOW, Deniro give a performance as spooky and warped as I have seen. I've seen a lot of Deniro films. His performance in 'Awakenings' has always been what I considered his best. This performance is a tie!"
4,The martin and bobby show,with martin having found his new muse in leo i found it particularly interesting to go back and watch his later work with his former avatar. i dont know that its as award worthy as some of there past collaborations but its still high quality and well worth watching
5,movie review,This is one of my favorite with Robert De Niro. It just scary enough without being rediculous. It has plenty of action and the acting is great.Much better than the original.
4,Incredibly Tense,"This is a white knuckle ride from beginning to end largely due to the creepy performance of Robert DeNiro as a tatooed bible quoting ex-con who is stalking the family of the attorney who had defended him before he spent 14 years in prison. As Jack Cady DeNiro gives one of his most bizarre performances, as he portrays a man who is both resourceful and obsessed with revenge.The family played by Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis are a bit dysfunctional and Cady zeros in on their weaknesses and vulnerabilities like a bird of prey. All of the cast members are extraordinarily good in their respective roles.The direction of Martin Scorcese creates a building tension from the opening shots through the final scene.I deduct 1 star for the ending which goes a bit over the top and might have benefited from some additional editing but all in all this is a great horror tale of revenge by a psychopathic killer."
4,counselor...where are you?,"Cape Fear is a heck of a joyride. Scorcese's remake is brutal, fast paced, and quite creepy. Deniro is mennacing, repulsive, and mesmerising in his role. Great cameos from the two original actors, (Gregory Peck & Robert Mitchum). The music is explosive and the performances are just as good. Good to see the wonderful Jessica Lange exhibit her acting talents, far much greater then the lame King Kong remake in 1977. The true diamond in the rough is Juliette Lewis's performance. Outstanding as the easily deceived and young daughter of Sam Bowden,(Nolte). This film at times may be predictable, but you honestly are glued to this film, and hoping Nick Noltle prevails and rid of this creep. Max Cady, (DeNiro), ranks up there with Freddy, Michael, Jason, but Max is human, and he can be stopped. If I was a lawer, I wouldn't have messed with this guy by any means. Have a good time......I did!"
4,FEEL THE FEAR,"Cape Fear is a very invigorating movie filled with suspense and terror. This movie is very realistic which gives it an eerie essence, where the original was not as relatable or frightening. Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis really get into their part and their performences are wonderfully astounding. The whole movie was dark yet exceedingly interesting. The thing I didn't like about the movie was Nick Nolte's performence, which I found to be very boring and uncomplete. But, all in all, I would definitly recommend this film to anyone who likes profound and suspensful Scorsese movies. GO RENT IT NOW!"
2,Over the Top,"Sam Cady (Robert de Niro) has just been released from prison, and wants revenge on Sam Bowdon (Nick Nolte), the prosecutor who withheld evidence and sent him up. Cady begings stalking Sam's wife and daughter, so the family decides to hide in their houseboat in Cape Fear.I found this film way too violent for my taste. Robert de Niro is so convincing as the sadistic con that I could hardly watch him. Nick Nolte is fine as the lawyer, but I thought Jessica Lange as his wife and Juliette Lewis as the daughter were unappealing and miscast. I prefer the original version of ""Cape Fear"" with Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck."
5,"Great cast, great director, unbearable tension!","I am a huge fan of suspense films, anything from low-budget indie efforts to big-budget hollywood thrillers, but 1991's ""Cape Fear"" is definitely in my top 5! Nick Nolte is superb and believably human as the strained and stressed southern lawyer whose family life and professional life is falling apart. But the real show stopper is Robert DeNiro as the menacing psycho, Max Cady. From the moment you meet him in his 8x9 cell in prison you know he is insane. And in the bravura finale on Cape Fear he goes gleefully over-the-top and lets all hell break loose. If you are squeamish or easily disturbed, this film is not for you. There is extreme violence in a few portions of the film and a hard-to-take scene where Cady mutilates a woman in her apartment. But if you are a suspense fan and are in the mood for an emotional and tense film, ""Cape Fear"" is for you!"
3,Good but not as great as I thought,"This was a good movie but the scene with the daughter and the killer in the school was too long. This movies wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Too dramatic for no reason, the scenes were taped at odd angles. I wouldn't recommend it.I wanted to set this for a while but I'm now disappointed."
2,WHY BOTHER WITH THIS FILM,"I thought this film was a really bad remake of the great 1962 version. The 1962 film was much more frightening and intense than the remake, especially the death of Kersek. In the 1962 version, Robert Mitchum drowns him in the river, where in the remake, Kersek is strangled with a piano wire, which was too gory for me. I could have done without this.Even though I like Robert DeNiro, he was not able to carry out the role of Max Cady in the terrifying manner that Robert Mitchum did.The only good thing about this movie is that three of the original stars of 1962, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam made cameo appearances in this movie. Robert Mitchum was especially good in the role of the police chief.I recommend the original 1962 version."
5,ALL CHARLIE!!,"I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THIS CD AS FANTASTIC!! IF I COULD RATE THIS CD HIGHER THAN 5, IT WOULD HIT THE 10 MARK!! WHAT A PIECE OF WORK!!"
5,Fun and though-provoking read!,"Through her new book, Ruth Pennington Paget takes us on a summer-long journey into a new culture (Japan) through the eyes of an adventurous and curious teenager. Twenty years after her exchange to Japan, the author recounts her time abroad and her vivid memories of the many experiences she encountered. The book is not a travel book as much as a book about dealing with differences, communication and human connection.It teaches us that at the heart of understanding a different culture, we learn most about our own self and come to understand better our own values.This book is a fun read!"
5,"So comfy looking, I want one in my size!","I borrowed this from a friend for several months. My baby was always happy to hang out in it. I didn't have the hanging toy bar (didn't know there was one), but it still was a great place to set her down safely. All the fabric was removable and washable and cleaned up nicely. I used this when I started feeding her solids since I didn't have a high chair, and she seemed able to swallow easily and her head was supported so it was easy for me to feed her without her bobbing around. I loved it. She seemed too heavy for it by 19 pounds. I had a regular (boring) bouncer of my own, but for the next baby I'll buy one of these for myself. Great bouncer."
4,Wish they made these for adults.,My 1 month old almost lives in hers'. It's easy to move from room to room and is easy to clean.
3,"CUTE, NOT PRACTICAL...","I RECEIVED THIS AS A SHOWER GIFT, IT'S SOOO CUTE AND WELL MADE. BUT, MY NEWBORN NEVER LIKED IT, IT DOESN'T BOUNCE, IT HAS NO LIGHTS, MIRRORS ETC. IT WAS A NICE PLACE TO PUT DOWN BABY IN THE KITCHEN, BUT DOESN'T TOLERATE IT FOR LONG. I WOULD RECOMMEND ONE A LITTLE MORE ENTERTAINING SO IT LASTS LONGER! SHE'S ONLY 10 WEEKS, AND I JUST ORDERED HER A LEAP FROG CHAIR THAT GOT GREAT REVIEWS ACROSS THE WEB!"
1,$149??,"I don't understand Amazon's price for this item. Babies R Us has it regular price for $54.99. I can always find such good deals at Amazon but I guess not this time. I will be definitely be buying it elsewhere. As I have not purchased this yet, the one star is for Amazon's price and not for the product itself."
4,Happy to Have It!,My son is almost 4 weeks old and we've used this bouncer since we brought him home at 2 days old. Most days it is the ONLY place he will nap (in fact he is doing just that right now! Going on 2 and 1/2 hours!) and the sounds are good quality. I took the overhead bar off since he wasn't interested in it (yet) and it got in the way but will reattach when he gets a little older. My only complaint is the battery died pretty quick but I've been using it without the battery for about a week now to put him down for naps and it works well. I'm definitely happy to have it!
5,The best bouncer ever!,"I love this bouncer for my son, and he loves it too. I love the fact that it's shallow enough so I don't feel that his head bobs up and down. It is very supportive. I can turn on the vibrate and/or the nature sounds, or I can have it on the floor next to me and use my foot to bounce it. He is almost alwsys calmed by this bouncer."
5,Great for reflux babies,"My daughter has acid reflux and was unable to lie flat in her baby bed since we brought her home from the hospital. She slept in her car seat for the first couple of weeks, but I wanted something more comfortable for her as I knew that she would have to sleep upright for a while. I call this the ""Cadillac of bouncy seats"". It is very comfortable and my daughter sleeps well in it. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Good But Not Great!,"This DVD gives a good ideas for some good hitting drills.It could have been better.Maybe not as realistic as I would have liked,I don't always have access to a beautiful field like Cal.""Hitting Drills & Techniques""Consider Marty Schupak's HITTING DRILLS & TECHNIQUES. One of Amazon'sbest selling DVDs on Hitting."
2,Not worth it,"Where do I start? Well all the speeches with exception of two are from his first term - his farewell address and the 2000 DNC speech. Many, including the later, are cut short! Why? It makes no sense! And I cannot see any reason for several of the speeches selected for this DVD to be on there. I was under the impression this was supposed to be a collection of his most important and/or greatest speeches to the nation. I was dead wrong! In addition to several others I was really hoping to see I couldn't believe they left out all the state of the union speechs and the 92' and 96' DNC speeches! For any true Bill CLinton fan this DVD is NOT WORTH IT!"
2,spin with Mindy,I was disappointed with the purchase of this product. I would not recommend it at all. The instructor has good intentions but I think she talks excessively throughout the training and it is not necessary.
3,Not very difficult.,"I got on the bike and pedaled steadily increasing intensity like she did, but she never really became challenging. I take a class once a week and do other videos and sweat my butt off. I am fairly new to this, but I kept wondering when is she going to go?"
2,Cheap quality,"Drum came out of the box bent, don't think it was from the packaging. I saw the same one at the local box store for 10 bucks. Just hope that it doesn't break in your drain."
5,awesome!,this worked like a charm for my bathroom sink. i got the clog fixed in under 5mins. cheapest alternative to a motorized snake or the plumber.i can't believe i never bought one before.
3,"good idea, but didn't work for me","good product for $15, should normally work, but for mine, it was just too tough. my drain's shape was so tight, and my pipes were changing angles so much that it was sooo hard to get in. i got it in probably 6 ft and pulling it out totally bent the cable and it was then garbage. the plumber came and fixed it easily. i would say get this, then if it doesn't work you for sure need a plumber."
1,doesnt work or too hard to use,"well if you ask me, this thing is no more useful than using a wire hanger to fix a clog. i guess you are supposed to use muscle power totry to force the snake wire deep into the pipe(which is hard to do). I thought the spinning part of the device might help you with that,but it doesnt- all it really is is storage area for the snake wire. oh and the snake wire part got wet(obviously) and soon after it was completely rusted!"
5,Good value product,"I purchased this product to perodically clean the drains in our bathrooms. I once paid a plumber nearly $ 100 for a visit to clean one drain due to the water going out of the sink slower than desired. Based on the cost of this product that I will be able to use multiple time, it is well worth the money. It is simple to use and it works. Excellent value for those willing to do-it-yourself."
2,Could not get job done due to drain cover,"It seems like it could get job done, but I could not get it down the drain due to the drain design/cover. I guess you should make sure you can remove cover on your drain before buying. I could not remove cover (part of drain design), so I could not use this product."
2,Guess I'm not so handy,"I had high hopes for this item...I really thought I'd be able to unplug my bathroom sink by myself. BUT after struggling to keep the darn thing from zipping up and smacking me every time I turned the crank (I was trying for 45 minutes), I finally gave up and called the plumber. This may be a quality gadget, but it's definitely not for me."
3,Does not fit into my drain,"My bathtub drain began draining very slowly so instead of using a chemical product to pour down the drain, we read several review on drain clearing snakes and decided to purchase this one. Unfortunately, this specific product did not fit into our drain. I never noticed how the holes in our drains were so small. Our drain also does not go down straight. When we tried to fit this drain clearing snake, we could not even put an inch through since the tip of the snake is thicker than the rest of the wires coming out. The part on the top that winds the snake back up also did not work well for us. I read the instructions a few times before manually shoving it back into the blue container. We had to return the product and our snake experiment was unsuccessful."
1,Poor quality,"end Broke during the first use - the snake cable end broke away from the inside end of the knob, so could not be turned to advance or retract."
1,This product did not work at all,"I read these good reviews and purchased this product. However, it did not work at all. First of all, the wire does not come out, though I turned the handle clockwise following the instruction. It was completely useless and I struggled with it for 30 minutes with no results. I do not recommend this product."
5,"Heck yeah, what up now, clog?","Yeah so this thing worked GREAT for the clog in my bathroom. I put the cable in there, gave it a good shove and a bunch of turns, and pulled it back out and daaang, it was gross, but it made the water flow without impediments. Forget the plumber, get this thing!My only caveat is that it is kinda hard to get around corners with the cable. I wouldn't use it for clogs that are far down the drain with lots of twists and turns."
5,Great value and does the job!,"This thing did what a plumber was going to charge me over 100 bucks for which is to clear a clog in my bathroom sink. Also, the product is larger and heavier duty than the images look so i think it will last well. I had tried liquid plumber and it worked, for about 2 days and then the sink totally stopped up again. I opened the catch at the bottom of the U under the sink and inserted this thing deep into the drain.It took some fiddling go get it to negotiate the turn from where the sink pipe goes into the drain line but once it got past that, i was able to pull up the most heinous hairball I've ever seen. it was actually wrapped around the snake like a kabob you see at an Indian restaurant.The hardest part of the process was getting the monster hairball off of the snake! Also, it was messy since the snake is springy and likes to squirm around splashing hairball gunk everywhere. I recommend you wear dark colors when fighting big clogs and maybe have a bucket handy."
4,Good Product,"Did what I needed it to do. Moved into a new house 8 months ago and about every month my bath tub drain would drain so slow (craw) that I needed to use some drain-o. The drain-o would do the job but within about 10 days I would always notice it was draining slower. Decided that I had something blocking the path that the drain-o wasn't getting. Used this product about a month and a half ago and my drain is still draining great. It was hard to work the turns in the drain (for that reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5). But it got the clog and my drain, drains like it should and has stayed that way."
2,"Poor design, non ergonomic","Have had this snake for years. After using it again today, decided to get rid of it and get a better one. The design of this snake is non ergonomic. It requires significant effort to keep the handle balanced while turning the small handle. Not recommended."
4,WU PRODUCER MAINTAINING THE WU-TANG REP,"This debut album by Mathematics caught me by surprise when it was released, upon hearing various wu albums he had always been one of those producers that had made great wu tracks outside of the Rza template and when I heard about this album I became very excited.I have not been let down, there are some serious beats on this album not to mention some great guests featuring artists such as Raekwon, Method Man, La the darkman etc.Although a solid album it has to be said that only one track (respect mine) truly stand out but they are all pretty solid and most people are bound to find tracks which they will enjoy in particular, overall this album is top and should be considered purchased if you are a wu fan and enjoy good hip hop."
2,Creative and Unconventional People Review,"None of her web links are working, and she is not reachable by e-mail! That is very disappointing! Hopefully someone can get it working, as I was really enjoying the book."
1,A Great Idea Poorly Executed,"I thought this book would be so helpful to me, an artist looking for a tolerable day job while I continue to pursue my career. Unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment. I took the quiz and it identified me as a type which I honestly don't agree with. Most of the recommended jobs were neither interesting nor creative. The rest were impossibly out of reach, such as symphony conductor or State Director of Natural Resources (I mean come on - there are only 50 in the nation and they are political appointees). The last straw was when it recommended my current position - a job in which I am slowly dying from lack of stimulation."
1,Is Mariah playing with us?,"Hello! I must start saying I really like Mariah, and I own 3 of her previous cds. With the perfect ballad ""through the rain"" Mariah promised us a new album like her old ones. But she came out with an album not very different from Glitter, with R&B songs, and rappers too. I must say I like one or two songs, but why can't Mariah go back to what she did in the past? This album won't be her comeback success everyone was waiting for."
4,"Not her masterpiece, but a very good album","The fundamental problem with this album is that though it IS a damn fine return to form for Mariah, that's just what it is - a return to the sound of ""Daydream"" and not a progression forward. Don't get me wrong, it's a GREAT piece of music, but I was hoping for something more innovative. That being said, it should also be made clear that it's not by any means a disappointment. I've played this album in its entirety a few times in the past week and I'm not tired of it. I guess what should be said is that ""Charmbracelet"" IS a Mariah album and NOT Mariah TRYING to be Mariah. THAT was the only thing I was afraid of happening. There aren't any really bad songs on this album, which is something that I thought I'd have to get used to after hearing certain tracks off ""Rainbow"". Most of them are relatively simple but not to a fault - actually, ""Yours"" and a few other songs sound pretty classic and almost timeless. Definitely worth checking out."
5,P E R F E C T !!!,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!MARIAH'S VOICE SOUNDS DIVINE!!!THE BEST SONG IS '' I ONLY WANTED'',WHICH REMINDES ME ''MY ALL''!!!HEAR IT!!!BUY IT!!!"
4,Wonderful,"Mariah is absolutely stunning in this album, and she has indeed made a fantastic comeback with tracks like Through The Rain and The One. This album focuses on her raw vocals, the tracks are not annoying to the ear unlike Glitter where she does her ""dog whistle"". A very laidback album which has a very personal touch to it."
5,Through The Rain,"I got a copy of Mariah Carey's album ""Charmbracelet"" and I must say this was probably one of the best albums to be released in 2002. Mariah has really proved that she can make it through the rain,and despite everything she has been through she was still able to produce an album that was off the hook! This is the MC we all know and love. Mariah has a beautiful voice which is why she is able to make ballads such as ""Through The Rain"". I loved this album and MC's collaborations worked well with tracks like ""Boy (I Need You)"" w/Cam'ron,""You Got Me"" w/Freeway,Jay-Z,and I also really like ""You Had Your Chance"",and MC's version of ""Bringin On The Heartbreak"". I highly recommend this album. It's worth the time and money."
5,She totally came back,"I think this is the best Mariah album ever.It is so romantic and spritual.As usual she used her amazing voice with those marvellous songs.If you want to listen some really good music you should buy it.Even f you are not a big Mariah fan,I guarantee you will love this album and you will be her fan soon.Especially The One,My saving Grace and Clown are the best songs in this album.Also there is a song called Lullaby which sounds like The Roof,but Lullaby is like part 2 of The Roof.The album is wonderful I loved it."
4,Nice Comeback,"Mariah had a rough couple of year, but now she's back. This effort isn't her best, but she's on her way. After the Glitter album, I was afraid that we'd last Mariah forever. I treasure her early albums such as ""Mariah Carey"", ""Emotions,"" ""Music Box,"" even ""Butterfly."" This CD is reminiscent of old-school Mariah with great slow songs that show off her vocal range and a couple of good up-tempo songs. The first singal off the album, ""Through the Rain,"" is Mariah at her best, recalling her earlier standout slow songs, such as ""Hero"" and ""One Sweet Day."" Other quality tracks on the album are ""Boy (I Need You)"", ""The One,"" ""My Saving Grace, "" and ""Bringin' on the Heartbreak."" ""Sunflowers for Alfred Roy,"" is a song dedicated to her deceased father. Overall, this CD is good and a must have for Mariah fans."
5,THE DIVA DOES IT AGAIN!,"awesome, awesome like always. very edgy with r&b and flash of hip hop style. also some amazing ballads that she puts her whole heart into like ""i only wanted"" (i love that one). what an incredible voice!"
2,"Where are you going, Mariah?","This album, in a word, is a disappointment.There is no outstanding track with huge commercial success possibilities, and even the whole album isn't consistent.Why can't she make good ballads anymore?Why can't she make cool, up-beat songs anymore?What is she trying to deliver in her new album, which is sure to determine her future career at this point?No clue.Except for some good tracks ( even none of them would reach TOP 10, I guess. Her first single, Through The Rain, could not even reach TOP40,and that is the best track in the album. Too Sad.), the rest is a series of boring, irritating R&B+HIP HOP hybrids.Some say her previous flop, Glitter, was the worst album. But it surely had some outstanding tracks which her loyal fans still could love, such as Lead The Way or Never Too Far Away¡ but this album has not even met loyal fans¡ expectation."
5,This CD is the best!,"The best selling female artist of all time is BACK! Every song on this album is AMAZING and worth listening to. Whether you are a Mariah Carey fan or not, whether you like rap or gospel, or whether you like ballads or upbeat songs, you will love this. Some rappers including Cam'ron, Jay-z, Freeway, and more are featured, and of course, Mariah, the woman with 15 number 1 hits."
5,INCREDIBLE-SHES BACK,"Mariah has never been gone in my opinion, and me, being one of her hardcore FANS knows how hard she works, and all the things she does for her fans, me being at her NYC Signing for rainbow and waiting outside for 19 hours for her..standing the entire time cause it was raining..she sent trucks of pizza, doughnuts, and then rain ponchos, it was amazing, and i love her, this cd, CHARMBRACELET is amazing, all of the songs are great, and she sounds better than ever! there are nice dance songs with HOT beats, but also VERY VERY nice ballads, like I Only Wanted, and My Saving Grace, this album is def. worth buying, and def worth adding to your collection, even if you are NOT a Mariah fan, it has something for everyone! Peace."
5,MARIAH CAREY IS THE BEST.,"REALLY ENJOY THIS ALBUM I THINK IS AWESOME.THE VOICE OF MARIAH CAREY IS LOVELY,UNIQUE & AMAZING.I LOVE ""YOURS"" WOW! VERY ""HIGH RANGE VOCAL"" ""AMAZING"".*****""MY SAVING GRACE"" PERFECT!.*****""THE ONE"" IS AWESOME. *****""YOU GOT ME"" *****""YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE""*****""CLOWN"" ****""OH BOY""****""I ONLY WANTED""*****""THROUGH THE RAIN""(REMIX)*****""BRINGIN ON THR HEARTBREAK"" WOW! VERY HIGH NOTE!*****""SUNFLOWERS FOR ALFRED ROY"" IS VERY ANGELICAL.*****""SUBTLE INVITATION""*****WELL,IS A PERFECT COMEBACK FOR MARIAH CAREY I LOVE THIS ALBUM,I LIKE ALL SONGS,AND I LOVE THE VOICE OF MARIAH MORE THAN EVER."
2,Very Dissapointing... What happened?,"I thought this would be Mariah's big come back but its a waste of money! She dosent any high notes on this album except on the end of ""through the rain"". Please, If your a fan of her early albums, then you will definitly feel the same way"
2,This is for Rico!,"I get all the critics like you. I didn't like this album too much either. But in regards to what u said between her and Madonna,Whatever. I like Madonna, she is talented, and top trend setter, but as an artisr, not any better than Mariah. Mariah has always produced her music ever since her first album, Mariah Carey. Madonna has just been out longer than she has. It doesn't mean she has always been ahead. That's in your head. Don't try to put that on everyone. While the first couple of albums she did from her label Maverick, they have only gone platinum in the US, while Mariah's Music box and DayDream have been selling 20 million records world wide, 10 million in the US. You kinda overlooked your reasons there just to let u know, but I do understand everyone just has their favorites."
5,"""Charmbracelet: A Charmed Return!""","Charmbracelet is Mariah's personal story. If you listen to this album closely, you will find her various emotional feeling. Opened with ""Through The Rain"" you will hear how she is shouting out to anyone who make her down last year. Inspirational ""My Saving Grace"" is truly her gospel deep rooted classic you will long to hear. ""Boy (I Need You), ""You Got Me"" and ""The Ones"" are some of her previous typical well-known cheerful songs. Listen how Mariah gives a very sweet revenge on ""Clown"" or how she grooves with 80's vibe on ""Subtle Invitation"". Anyway, still ""Sunflowers for Alfred Roy"" is the song that represent each and every track on this return album. And it's a charmed return!"
2,Rather disappointed,"For being a huge fan of Mariah Carey's ever since she first started, I was rather disappointed with her new album ""Charmbracelet"". I found that I only REALLY enjoyed 3 songs on the album: Through the Rain, I Only Wanted, and My Saving Grace. Through the Rain is the only song that shows true dynamic. Tracks 2 through 14 each have the same musical undertones, the raspy, whispery voice and a synthesized version of Mariah's voice. I honestly think her CD ""Glitter"" was a better demonstration of her vocal talents and creativity than her CD ""Charmbracelet""...sorry Mariah."
3,"Much better than ""Glitter"", but still not the best.","After having an extremely rough year, with the loss of her father & publicized breakdown, Mariah returns with ""Charmbracelet"". Now, I'm a big Mariah fan, but I feel that this album does not do her any justice. I know Mariah could probaly still belt it out, but she chose to use her ""whispering"" voice throughout the entire album. I personally loved ""Rainbow"". Even though she used her high pitched singing on the album, it wasn't as consistent as it is on ""Charmbracelet"". On some of the songs you can't even understand what she is saying. But even after all my ranting, I feel that the album is good, but it's not her best (""Butterfly"" is her best..IMO) or her full potential vocally."
3,"not so good,but not bad to buy",every song sounds good.but not brillMC shoule sing better songs.not these......
1,Old News,"I have all of Mariah's CDs and unfortunately her latest doesn't raise the bar. With the introduction of new artists (J. Lo, Xtina and Ashanti)-a new sound is emerging. Mariah nees to be inventive. Granted she has a great voice but it doesn't sound as fresh as in her previous albums. All of the 3 divas mentioned have great albums that leave a lasting impression-unlike charmbracelet."
2,Breathy Mariah,"Mariah's quest to come up with an album that matches her earlier successes is sadly not matched by her vocal quality. Gone are the days when she sandblasts her song with her 5 octave voice and it is now replaced by breathy, trying to sound sultry vocals. There are just too many cracks in her vocals that even computer splicing and dicing won't work. She needs a voice lift."
1,Her voice is gone,"If you are looking for new music by the used-to-be power ballad queen, look elsewhere because it seeems Mariah has lost most of her talent. I used to be a big fan but just when you think she will belt out a beautiful voice on this CD, she just whispers. What's with that? How did the producers let this happen? I was extremely dissapointed especially with ""Bringin on the Heartbreak"". I expected an awesome, powerful re-make, but it's nothing but whispering. They have background singers to try to make up for her lost voice, but it just doesn't cut it. Mariah, where has your voice gone?"
2,Mariah! What's going on with you?,"I'm not impressed with this CD. Thank goodness I got a copy of it free a few weeks before it was released and didn't pay for it.There are way too many slow songs and her voice is not what it used to be. Her first and second album, her voice had a lot more power. If you like a lot of whispy vocals and romance, than I would recommend it, and if your looking for a better cd, it's certainly not Whitney new one. The ""Divas"" are going through some bad times. Thank goodnes for Deborah Cox."
4,a great come back,i really liked this CD it is great. i like that she has put together the CD. you must buy it!!
3,Mariah grows up!,"Mariah Carey finally grows up. No more leaning on the rap community to give her street cred or gold booty shorts to show she's sexy. It's about time!The songs on this album are very catchy with good hooks (the exception being the insipid ""Through the Rain). She really lets them breathe on this outing. Mariah usually bounces from giddy schoolgirl love to melancholy ballads so its nice to see her actually express some anger as she does to Eminem on ""Clown"".My only real problem is that instead of wailing or using her low register she prefers to sing in almost a hoarse whisper. She saves all the ""Mariahisms"" for the background. This does not help some of the songs especially ""Bringing on the Heartbreak"" which crys out for the Diva-treatment.It's no ""Daydream"" but it is satisfying."
4,This One Is A Charm!,"""Charmbracelet"" is undoubtedly one of Mariah's best albums to date (besides ""Butterfly"") and she sounds better than ever. I have to say that the best songs on the album are these:Through The RainBoy (I Need You)The OneYoursYou Got MeI Only WantedClownMy Saving GraceLullabySunflowers For Alfred RoyThe rest of the tracks are just utter garbage, despite what others may think. I gave this album 4 stars because tracks 9, 11, 12, 13, and 15 were too overproduced sounding. But this CD is worth the money! Great job, Mariah."
5,pure pleasure,"Mariah Carey has done it again! Except this time people noticed. She has her classic ballads, great slow jams, and special hip-hop/r&b fusions that make this cd my favorite since rainbow. I love through the rain, oh boy, and the song (Clown) that supposedly refers to Eminem, the best right now. Yours is a beautiful slow jam that is great for relaxation. Overall i'd say you get the most for your money with this cd if you like variety."
3,"Just ok, expecting better","It seems like Mariah may be making her way back from the rap and imitation R&B she got so caught up in. Yes, she will always sing ballads, and sing them well. The thing that made her a superstar was her ability to write and perform fun, orginal upbeat songs.Think about Fantasy, Someday, even Honey. Now it seems that all of her songs that aren't ballads are her whispering and cooing, and very little vocalizing. I want to hear her let loose like Celine Dion, because like it or not, that is the kind of singer her fans want. I will say that Clown is a nice attempt on her part, but overall this CD could cut out 8 tracks and no one would notice because they all sound the same."
3,Someone outa tell Mariah that Charbracelts are easy to break,"Mariah is my favorite singer because she can bust out like a big black woman; however, Charmbracelt contains nothing but breathy vocals and gangsta beats. I know Mariah is a fan of hip-hop and she should keep it that way. This album makes it sound like Mariah is getting lazy with her singing. I don't really know why her album is dominated by breathly vocals and heavy rap beats when everyone of her fans prefears her old style. Charmbraclet has a few jems such as, I Only Wanted, My Saving Grace and Bringing On the Heartbreak but the list ends there. Buy this album anyway because Mariah RULES! If anything, it'll grow on you."
4,Give it a rest,"This CD is good. People as a whole are very fickle (one minute a celeb is on the top, the next at the bottom--ask Michael, Mariah or Whitney).Mariah has taken the time to put together a good mix of R&B, Pop, hints of jazz and gospel. Just put it in your player and RELAX--it's not that DEEP!"
4,Mariah Carey Is Back!,"This new album ""Charmbracelet"" Mariah shows that she can still sing. Mariah bounces back from her last album/soundtrack ""Glitter"" great ballads ""I Only Wanted"", ""My Saving Grace"" and the smash hit single ""Through The Rain"". But if want to shake it a little more to the music you can go for ""Boy"" and ""The One"". Mariah shows skills on this album. She sings a song for her late father in ""Sunflowers For Alfred Roy"". This song is one of the best songs on the album. Mariah is still the best and her voice is better than ever!"
5,Welcome Back Mariah!!,"Mariah Carey is one of the most if not the most talented writer & singer out there and many times she does not get the prop's she deserve by the critics.Mariah's new album ""Charmbracelet"" is amazing I would very much recommed it to everyone.I can listen to this album over and over,In my opinion ""Charmbracelet"" has @ lease 10 potential #'s 1 hits.My favorites tracks are:""Through The Rain"",""Boy"" feat Cam'ron,(her next single)""The One"", ""Yours"", ""You Got Me"" feat Freeway/Jay-Z, ""I Only Wanted""(I love this ballad),""Clown"",""My Saving Grace"",""Lullaby"", ""Irresistible"",""Subtle Invitation"",""Bringin'On The Heartbreak"" Hell I LOVE the entire album."
5,This is so far my favorite Mariah Cd!!:),This cd is definetely Mariah. She comes back strong and it shows. She is out to prove that just because you have one poor cd doesn't mean that your career will be over. I recommend this Cd because it is Mariah Carey!!:)
2,Not what I expected at all!,"The titles sounded pretty interesting and me being a big Mariah fan, I choose to buy the cd. I have been a big fan of hers for quite some time. But with this cd, I was not impressed. I don't like how she trys to be r&b and rap. She can't cut it well. I think her older albums are better. Rainbow is still better than this cd. I heard this was a good cd. Most of her songs in here has a little bit of rap in it. The noise of rappers covering her own voice isn't cool at all. Some of the lines the rappers make in the beginning and in the song sound terrible and make no sense. That fast talk whispering noise doesn't sound too attractive either. As a fan I still would say her older music was where she has impressed and gave me the approval of my taste of her music."
2,Not her best,"I was really looking forward to her new album, but was very disappointed. In general, the songs were OK, but none really stood out to me. It just seemed like all the songs sounded the same and you couldn't tell which one started and which one ended. I can't figure out what style or direction she was trying to go for."
2,Good artist; bad record,"Fans of ""Mariah: The Early Years"" should take caution before buying this CD: you will be sorely disappointed. Critics have reported that she returns to form on this album, but I certainly don't hear it. Sensational media drama aside, this woman has an AMAZING voice -- so it perplexes me that she and her producers fail to put it to good use. She seems to whisper a good portion of her vocals, and the majority of cuts are geared toward a rap-oriented audience. (This latter part is perhaps the most unfortunate blow to this long-time Mariah fan.) There are about five (out of 15!) songs that I would listen to again, the best of which is ""My Saving Grace."" Is that worth the money I handed over to give her a chance to recapture my interest? Not in my eyes. What I see instead is a great artist struggling to come back out on top by trying to please too many audiences. In the end, I don't think she'll end up pleasing anyone."
3,Charmed... a little,"This album is pretty good. It will do well in sales if she releases the right singles from this point forward. Through the Rain was a good choice for lead single and Boy was a good follow up. I would recommend Irresistible for the next single. She definatley jumped on the bandwagon of adding R&B flavor to previous Hip Hop Hits. Irresistible is a competent remake of Ice Cube's ""You Know How We Do It."" Carey also remade Snoop's ""Ain't Nothin but A G Thang,"" on her song You Had Your Chance. It's OK, something that will compliment the woofers in your trunk, but that's about it. Mariah's voice remains her savior... her ballads and mid tempo cuts are alluring; she has a beautiful voice and it shines through on this album. Why only 3 stars you might wonder? Well, I would have liked more in the area of production. Crisper sounds, more creativity. But all in all a good albumn. A must have if you're a Mariah fan."
5,Mariah Mariah Mariah,"All I can Say is ""Mariah."" Almost every album she releases seems to get better and better. I will say this album may be the new beginning of Mariah as far as experimenting with other styles of music like jazz. She has one track with a funky, jazzy number ""Subtle Invitation"" in which she does really well. Standout tracks would be (Yours, Boy (I Need You), Clown, and Sunflowers For Alfred Roy). This album is more soft R&B with a little Pop and most Mariah fans and others she had lost should be able to enjoy the selections. Charmbracelet is comparable to Mariah's first album but updated."
5,Classic Mariah,Mariah Delivers what fans have been waiting for. Beautiful voice used in a Magnificent way.
5,YOU GO GIRL !,"Welcome back Mariah ! Wonderful Comeback ! This album reminds me of her in 1990 with ""Vision of Love"". You go girl! You did it from the heart. This album has meaning. Mariah, at her best once again!Excellent Work.Congratulations!Highly recomend buying."
3,Mariah Carey- Charmbracelet,"Well lets see Mariah,Mariah, Mariah. This album is a compilation of Minni Ription/Dianna Rosses soft sexy coos high piched dolphin screams and in the middle of all that is Mariah.... and the colaborations!Don't get me wrong I am an obsessed fan but this album just doesn't hit me like the old Mariah. She needs to pitch the samples of everyone elses song and be genuine again. She needs to loose the rappers on every up tempo song and save that for the remixes. And she needs to sing, sing as she calles it, on this cd she uses too much soft sexy coo vocals which you can barly understand. This is a good comback cd but not as good as gold, more like a tarnished copper though I will continue to be a loyal fan but there has to be a change of heart and music. This is a nice developing work you should buy because it has an excellent story line like her Rainbow cd!!!!!!!"
3,It's Descent.,"I am a huge MC fan, but Butterfly was her last solid album, imo, she does have some very great ballads on here, maybe too many, but her voice seems to has changed, she sounds more like she whispering then anything. My fav. song on here is ""Bringing on the Heartbreak"". Any MC fan should get it, i think i was just expecting to much from it. It's defitnitley worth having."
4,Charmbracelet - Simply Charming,"If you're a music fiend looking for an album on which no two tracks are the same, ""CharmBracelet"" (Mariah Carey's freshman release on Island/Def Jam/MonarC records), is for you.Her first radio-single ""Through it All"" is signature ""Carey"" ballad-and harkens back to the ""Vision of Love"" days. But there is more to this woman's latest release than Ballads. With collaborations ranging from Jay-Z (""You got Me""), to (West Side Connection)""Irresistable"" the former Ms. Mottola continues to spread her wings and flex well-toned musical muscle by keeping things interesting, right down to the heavily-Gospel-tinged ""My Saving Grace"".I found this record highly encouraging and uplifting."
5,Marvellous Comeback Album!,"This new Mariah release is the comeback album of the year!Nobody sings like the way Mariah sings... GREAT!I love the tracks Through the Rain, Yours, My Saving Grace and Bringing on the Heartbreak!Way to go, Mariah!"
5,Top to bottom - very good album,"Her time off must have really gotten her creative juices bubbling, because this album is right up there with ""Music Box,"" and ""Daydreamer"" Mariah's vocals are as powerful as ever as evident on ""My Saving Grace,"" and ""Through the Rain."" She flexes her hip-hop flava on fun tracks such as ""Boy"" and ""You Got Me."" Then there are songs that showcase her neo soul side(Through The Rain (Remix), Subtle nvitation,lullaby), that provide something different and refreshing. But my favorite track has to be ""Clown,"" in which she lyrically demolishes Eminem, it's quite funny!!Good way to start off on her new label - she definitely still has it!"
5,A charmer!,"First she signs with Columbia,then Virgin and now with this album,Island. Did she get dropped again from Columbia? Maybe. Maybe not. Mariah might have willfully quit Columbia and moved to Island. This album's cover is BRINGIN' ON THE HEARTBREAK which was a hit for Def Leppard in the early 80's. THROUGH THE RAIN became a #1 hit. Other great-sounding tracks include BOY,IRRESISTIBLE and CLOWN. All the other songs are cool."
2,blah...,"This is OK. Nothing spectacular...I see no ""come-back."" But I see a transformation...to blandness. This bores me. I can't stand the breathiness. Mariah has one of the most beautifully toned voices in the biz...I wish she would use it!!! I'll just keep waiting I guess."
5,Mariah-CharmBracelet,"The new mariah carey cd, is Irresistible, just like the track of the same title w/ westside connection. This cd is very diverse, in category, w/ jazz, hip-hop, r&b, and pop all included! Not one song worth skipping, this cd is very good! The colabos w/ Jay Z, Freeway, Cam'Ron, Joe, and Kelly Price, w/ the rest of westside connection, are all great tracks, and lines like ""she just like honey, so she got me like winnie the pooh,"" fit mariah perfectly, if u dont have this cd, u are crazy, and i suggest you go get it!"
3,Just Average,"Mariah has more talent than what is demonstrated on this CD. She used to have a characteristic style, but this new CD is a collection of songs that mimic the bubble gum songs of Brittany Spears and Christina Aquilera. I prefer the mature sounding Mariah. Also, the lyrics of her first song ""Through the Rain"" are depressing and sad instead of uplifting because of the way she sings - like she's in pain and it's forced. If you are a fan, you will want this for your collection. But if not, buy her previous CD's, they are all better than this one."
2,Same old sound,She needs to stop singing already. All her music is the same and this album tells a lot about her but she needs to stop making all her songs sound the same.
2,fairly average,while there are some moments here&Her Voice sounds Good the Material overall is like a Carry Over from what She has been doing over the last few years.I'm still waiting for that Most Have Album from her.thus far She is more of a Really Good Singles Artist.
5,Charmed,"Mariah Carey is the most talented singer. She is one of the most successful women in the music business. She is also one of the most hardworking artist. She Put alot of effort into this Album and you can hear it. In her first single "" Through the rain"" she sounds much like the rain. Just close your eyes and you'll be able to hear everything she's thinking when she's singing. But it does sound as if shes holding back her vocals a little bit. But no matter, it's still one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard. Bringin' On The Heartache is really beautiful. She sounds just wonderful. Her vocals are strong. Her more up beat songs are mediocre compared to all the ballads on here. Shes Amazing. Just try this album out. You won't be disappointed."
3,Good for Mariah,"Well this album is not as good as Mariah Carey or Music Box, but its not too bad either, i am just a lil, disspointed coz for me (fan since 1990) this album sounds like a ""mix"" of RAINBOW and GLITTER... nothing really knew.My favotite tracks are:1) I only wanted (sounds like ""my all"", ""after tonight"")2) Brining' on the heartbreak (excellent vocals)3) The One (very r&b song, should be a single)4) My saving Grace ( sweet song)5) Lullaby and Clown (catchy songs)Mariah has a extraordinaty voice but she needs to rest a bit and come back with better songs ....I love mariah and i recommend this album , but dont expect too much from it..."
5,a must for every r&b fan,"I have to say that ""Charmbracelet"" is definetely one of Ms. Carey's best albums so far! If you always liked her ballads, you'll love the album, if you always liked her ability to mix HipHop and Pop you'll love it and even if you didn't like her too much so far you'll like it! As always, Mariah shows her amazing vocal range and there are really great vocal arrangements on the album, just as awesome lyrics. There are really strong ballads like ""My Saving Grace"" and ""I Only Wanted"", there are R&B tracks like ""You Got Me"" and ""Clown"" and there are songs which show a new side of Mariah. I have to say that I absolutely love the jazz touch to ""Subtle Invitation"" and Mariah did a great job with covering the Def Leppard song ""Bringing On The Heartbreak"". So, I think this album is a must for every R&B fan."
5,The Rainbow still exists.,"Mariah Carey has become a woman right in front of our eyes. Through the turmoil of an emotional breakdown and the death of her father Carey has proven she still has got it.Carey proves through this ""comeback"" album that she has what it takes to be on top, and rightfully deserves that title. No longer a slave to barely-there crop tops and mini-skirts she showcases her beautifully gifted vocal skills and soulful, heartfelt lyrics.With 'Through The Rain' Mariah pinpoints the true essence of inspiration and caries that throughout 'Charmbracelet' with tracks ""My Saving Grace"", ""I Only Wanted"" and ""Bringing On The Heartache"". She creatively flows the hiphop feel with her power ballads and thus the end result still remains to be the rainbow after a the storm of last year."
2,I think it's her worst,"I really love most of her other work, but these songs just seem to run together and sound the same. I was very disappointed."
3,Why people said it more good than her previous album???,"people always said that this album was a great album for a comeback. but i found that in this album, most of the song is boring. mariah whisper all the time. the only song that good is through the rain,boy,bringing on the heartbreak,i only wanted and the one."
1,This is Whack!,"This CD has not only an once of anything good on it. Except for an occassinal dime, there's nothin' but dead air! I only like ""Give it to You"" because Busta Rhymes is on it & ""Boy, I Need You"" because Cam'ron is on it.Get Ce Ce Peniston's ""THOUGHT YA' KNEW"" cd instead."
3,"Mariah, your fans expect better!","Let me start off by saying I am a fan of Mariah Carey. I bought Glitter when no one else did, and think it deserved to do better than it did. However, this CD deserves to flop. Not because the songs are bad. They are actually pretty decent.Mariah has always been praised for her vocals, and not her songwriting. It seems like on this CD, she is aiming for the other way. She has a lot of well-written music, like her ode to making it through hard times on ""Through the Rain,"" the he-done-me-wrong ballad ""Clown,"" and my favorite track, ""Subtle Invitation."" But her vocals are at their worst here. She has a whispery singing voice, rather than the high pitched vocals that tore even the [least] song apart. Whispery, breathy vocals may have worked for Aaliyah, but they don't for Mariah. Mariah should just take a year or two off. Rest her voice and then record some more. Making an album every year has taken a toll on her."
2,Overproduced!!,"I totally disagree with the Amazon.com editor with regard to his review. As an editor, he should know better!Charmbracelet is mediocre, at best! I honestly expected a more stripped down version of Mariah. What she has done on Charmbracelet is similar to what she did on ""Rainbow"", but with MORE drama.Mariah's voice is so GREAT I don't think she even realizes it. Her voice and her lyrics with very little, if any, instrumental accompaniment is all Mariah really needs! Her vocal power cannot and should not be confined to the COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION displayed on ""Charmbracelet"".Definately NOT vintage Mariah!"
3,Good album but...............,This is a good album. All she needs to do is stop dressing like a hoochie.
4,Mariah's Return,"Mariah Carey's Charmbracelet is a rather stunning return for the diva after the previous two ablums, which were'nt her best work. I liked this album because of the mixed influnces of the music; ballads, urban tracks, a gospel track, a jazz-esque track, and a spanish influenced track. One of the more delicate songs of Carey's career is a heart-felt dedication to her father on the album, called ""Sunflowers for Alfred Roy."" Although she is not reaching her full potential she still manages to produce a smash hit so far and a great album overall."
3,It's ok,"The songs have good lyrics, but in some of the songs i can't understand what she is singing. Ok Mariah we know you have a great voice don't over do it by whispering a stretch out note,I can't understand what you are singing. But anyways thankfully the CD has the lyrics."
1,Did not cut it,"A talent as Mariah - wasted on this CD and how sad is that.I used to love her music so much up to Butterfly. Even on Rainbow there are songs that I love such as Heartbreaker regular and rap version. Also - Cry Baby and many more. But this one was total disappointment. The one song I like truly is ""Bringing on the heartbreak"" and that is not even her song though she does a fantastic job. Mariah is such a wonderful talent and I hate to hear her wasting in music like this after her first albums. She surely changed in music style and I much preferred the pop/rock style. Perhaps this is because I do not get into R+B a lot - that is something that I cannot help! If you love R+B - this is the CD for you. If you love Mariah's old stuff - get ready for disappointments. :-(In any case, Mariah does not need a ""come-back"", she will always be a great musician."
3,Slowly going off the boil,"I have all of Mariah's cds. However, this is the cd that I've listened to the least. I can't quite explain it, because I love almost all the works she's ever done, but something about this, is off. I loved Through The Rain, and I was hoping the rest of the cd would be as good as that song but it's not. As I'm looking at the back cover again, I can't really recall how any of the other songs go, which is a sad thing to admit for a Mariah fan. Now with Emancipation of Mimi, her stocks have gone back up. Get this cd only if you are a true fan, or otherwise, stick to the newer release and skip this. It ain't her best."
3,WHY OH WHY???!!!,"If you're gonna sing, then sing, don't whisper! As the other reviewer says, where has her voice gone, and WHY OH WHY did she even bother trying to cover Def Leppard - Bringin' On The Heartbreak, why, Mariah you were remotely good at one time, but not now, and don't touch songs from artists who were only impeded on their path to greatness by tragedy, please if your gonna sing do it properly with at least some emotion, that perfectly good rock song sounds like every other woman's love song ever recorded now......"
5,WOW,Mariah Carey is absolutely amazing... I like her songs and her voice is still beautiful! Im giving 5 stars for her new album...
4,Listen to it more than once before you judge it.,"When I first heard this CD, I was like ""what the hell?"" but thats because I was listening to it very low and i had a headache and a bunch of other stuff going on. But once I sat down with earphones (the best way to listen to music), I really fell in love with the album. The only thing I don't like is that Mariah sings breathy and soft on basically every song. I miss the powerful voice that she showcases on her past CDs (Classic Mariah, meaning Mariah from her first CD through Daydream, possibly Butterfly, is the best). Lullaby, I Only Wanted, Subtle Invitation, and Irresistible are among the best on the CD (I personally think Lullaby should be the next single instead of The One but thats a good song also). Every Mariah fan should buy this CD. Its great and it certainly grows on you."
3,Good Album!,"Lyrically this album is BEAUTIFUL, I think MC was going for the laid back mellow feel for this album. She could have done a way better job ""vocally"" with this album, a little less whisper and alot more belting. I'm still waiting on another album from her that will blow me away she did it with ""glitter"" and i hope she do with her new LP which will be released later on this year.;-)"
3,3 stars,"3 stars for the only good song here, (Through the rain) And people call it a come back? She never left just had issues thats all. But I dont like this CD, she is not using her voice anymore all sounds like high wispers, Come on Mariah. Now for the record some of mariah fans need to lay of bashing Madonna. MADONNA IS STILL HERE, and always been ahead of Mariah and all the rest. Sorry to lay it on the line but ive read some reviews here, Madonna has nothing to due with Mariahs failing to chart (solo) that is, and low album sales. thats on you guys.... thanks!!!!!"
3,Pretty good but not really mariah,"This album is good but personally I feel that Mariah is trying to appeal to the masses instead of being herself as she was on Glitter. I really dont feel like she followed her heart as much as she has in the past! I enjoyed Glitter a whole lot more than this album,,but ""My Saving Grace"" is really a great song and really shows how beautiful Mariah's voice can be. Even though Glitter didnt do that well nationally I feel it was a much better album.."
1,Mariah ... we have a problem ...,"I don't know about you, but when I first listened to ""Through the Rain"" I desperately wanted to give Mariah an oxygen mask. The poor thing just kept on making those horrible noises with her throat and she seemed to be exhaling with extreme difficulty.But then, after a couple of minutes, she must have coughed something out because she could yell once again.Seriously, I know people get old and voices mature with age, but finding the appropriate tune to fit current vocal capabilities is not that difficult. Take Whitney Houston and her latest work ...Bad move, old girl! One more like this and there will be no ""Charmbracelet"" powerful enough to save you from your final decay."
2,I really didn't like it,"I really didn't like Charmbracelet all that much.. It sounded to reproduced and sampled. I actually failed to find much originality in it at all. I liked Through the Rain, but everything else just seemed blah.. ..."
1,she cant be considered as a real singer,"i dont like this album because its boring and not very good. she shouldnt sing anymore cuz she sucks at it.why dont she act instead. wait, hole up, she cant act either. lolDONT FORGET THE FLOP THAT GLITTER WAS!"
3,IT WAS AN ALRIGHT COME BACK,"I thought that this cd was an alright cd. I thought that Yours, Bringing on the Heartbreak, Through the Rain, and Saving Grace were the only songs that stood out. SHE NEEDS TO STOP USING HER HIGH WHISPERING STYLE, ALTHOUGH HER SCREAMING IS MAGNIFICENT. NO ONE SCREAMS AS GOOD AS MARIAH IT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT. I hope that next time she will sing with attitude and show the real power of her voice. Wish You Lots of Luck Mariah......"
4,A nice effort!,"I bought this today only because it was on sale at Target, but I'm pleasantly surprised by what I've found. I think it's a great mix of songs and it shows how easily Carey is able to work different styles of music. She sounds as at ease on the gospel-tinged ""My Saving Grace"" as she does on the more hip-hop influenced cuts like ""Boy"" and ""You Got Me."" And there are a couple of ballads too. A couple of tracks sound a bit more serious and reflective that Carey's usual fluff, and that was nice too. I'm glad she didn't over-reach trying to make some grand statement about where she's been. She kept it simple, but at the same time showed that she has real songwriting and producing potential. This is a nice blend of songs and definitely worth the [money] I spent."
5,"""I still belive that after every storm... a rainbow appears""","I think that Charmbracelet is the album of the year..everybody talks about it...and why? Because is Mc and her big came on.The lyrics are great Thought the rain, yours, i ionly wanted, clown, my saving grace,sunflowers....And i love the beat of lullaby, subtle invitation, irresistible, boy, the one... My favorite are: My saving grace and the awsome bringin on the heartbreak! This album should be #1!!"
4,good work,"it is a really good cd that you can just jam to in your car with your friends and the song ""through the rain is a song that lifted me up and make me realize that i can be strong in anything that i do."
4,A Good Album,"Tal vez no sea el mejor album de Mariah (dejemos ese lugar para Daydream) pero aun asi el cambio de productores y disquera le sienta bien y presenta una estupenda coleccion de canciones, que no se oia desde ButterflyBuen discoGrade: B"
3,Not Mariah's Best,"Mariah Carey is one of my favorite singers, yet I was a bit disappointed after listening to her new album Charmbracelet. Her lyrics are powerful however her voice is not. On most, if not all of her songs, she goes back to her back-up singer days using a wimsy, wimsical, and at times weak vocal tone. With a bit more heart, soul, and power behind her voice the album, in my opinion, would be a hit. Maybe she'll reinvent her song(s) through one of her many remixes she is so found of doing! I think that my favorite song on the album is My Saving Grace, the powerful lyrics and the heart and soul she puts into belting out the tune make it a beautiful and touching song (like Through the Rain). I would have liked to have heard more upbeat tunes, a more soulful voice, and less 'girliness' from Mariah, but I do give her props for writing the songs and moreover mad props to her for writing from her heart."
2,Overproduced!,"I totally disagree with the Amazon.com editor with regard to his review. As an editor, he should know better!Charmbracelet is mediocre, at best! I honestly expected a more stripped down version of Mariah. What she has done on Charmbracelet is similar to what she did on ""Rainbow"", but with MORE drama.Mariah's voice is so GREAT I don't think she even realizes it. Her voice and her lyrics with very little, if any, instrumental accompaniment is all Mariah really needs! Her vocal power cannot and should not be confined to the COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION displayed on ""Charmbracelet"".Definately NOT vintage Mariah!"
4,Definitely better than rumor says it is,"Detractors made Charmbracelet sound like one of the most disappointing albums in history, but Mariah Carey (in my opinion) glows here despite her critics. Her voice is in top shape--so what if she gets breathy at times? Even breathy she delivers some of the best vocals by any female artist out there. Despite reviewers, I think ""Bringin' On The Heartbreak"" is one of the best songs, though a cover, on the CD; the ending high part is magnificently executed. The record has its low moments, but at its lowest the songs are decent, just not memorable. Mariah Carey is one of the greatest singers in history, and definitely (in my opinion) one of the top female vocalists, and shows her brilliant singing abilities here. Surprisingly better than expected."
2,weak,"This is a weak comeback. MC does not break new ground and it is just an OK album. The problem with being OK is that OK is barely enough to get by, especially since MC is trying to come back from a fatigue, as she likes to call it, or as her critics say ""nervous breakdown."" She should have waited longer to work on it to make it better. Circulating it around her critics and then going back to the drawing board would have done it and then releasing it to the public would have been one way to get it right. MC said on Larry King Live that she doesn't know whether she has really been in love. Well, doesn't that say something? If she has never been in love, how can she write a decent song? Getting older she must be a bit cynical. sure, she is romantic -- she has to be, in order to write songs like this, but given that she has never been in love what does she know? She is committed to her work but the lack of sincerity in her product shows."
3,Not good! :(,"I got this album the day it came out and I totally regret buying it. It's hard to believe this is the woman who made ""Daydream"" (which would sadly be her last good album). This album contains filler only. ""Through The Rain"" failed on the charts and you can hear why. It's not good! If you want to get a good Mariah Carey album get ""Daydream."" It's her best album under Sony records. This is a waste of money!"
3,What happened?,"I'm a Mariah fan. I have all of her albums, but i was kind of disappointed with this one. I got really irritated with all the 'moaning' Mariah's doing in her songs, i was annoyed with the ad libs that Jermaine Dupri throws in destroying the beauty of the songs (i.e: the one, you had your chance), for mariah not experimenting with new styles, i'm giving the album 3 stars1st star for SUBTLE INVITATION...the most interesting song she's done for quite some time, loved the sound2nd star for LULLABY...nice lyrics, tight beat, simple yet sophisticated3rd star for THROUGH THE RAIN REMIX...the feel of the song is warm, inviting, hopeful and different from the other remixes she has doneMariah, don't worry i'm still waiting for your next album."
2,Her Weakest Album to Date!,"It is a shame to see her throw away her trademark sound & gravity-defining vocals for tracks that sound like J-Lo cast-offs and that annoying wispher. I would like it if she stops trying to keep up with the ""Ashanti/B2K"" crowd. I gave this cd two stars because of the decent song ""My Saving Grace"" & ""Throught the Rain"". Although ""Throught the Rain"" is a weak attempt to recreate the magic and power she showed on her earlier single such as ""Vision of Love"" & ""I Can't Live if Living Is Without You"". She had power & control over her voice but her voice is shot & has very little depth. The people that like this cd most is people into Hip-Hop..."
5,Mariah - sweet as always !,"I adore this voice ! It's pureness and the way the diva controlit is amazing ! No doubt,this girl is born to do it !"
4,back in form,"Mariah's new CD, Charmbracelet, is really wonderful. It's back to the Mariah we all love. She really displays her great vocal talents in this album and there is variety whilst still keeping to a theme. My favourites would have to be 'Through the Rain' and 'My Saving Grace' but they are all fabulous. Well done Mariah!"
1,Predictably Bad,"After I heard the first single, I had a gut feeling this was yet another forgettable Mariah record and I shouldn't waste my money. But I bought a copy anyway. Note to self: Go with your gut. This album is a continuation of the train wreck that began with Rainbow and it just gets worse with every release. Her vocal ability is clearly the bread and butter of her career, but that's no excuse for trite lyrics and incessant sampling of other hip hop songs. I only gave it 1 star because there's not a choice for no stars."
1,waisted effort for 2000's WMA millenium artist.,"World Music Awards hailed Carey as the Female Millenium Artist for 2000, and during that time, Carey has been occasionally flopping singles and album. ""Charmbracelet"" is a cheater. You thought you'll get songs more of like ""Through The Rain"" but then when you get this album, all you'll get are faceless hip hop collaborations with different rappers about to lose their sanity! I'll give one star for my favorite ""Bringin' On The Heartbreak"". It still shows that Carey can still carry a tune, get edgy and certainly shows a different side of her. That's about it! even ""Through The Rain"" is just another ballad off the garbage bin! Ditch this bracelet."
2,"Weak album...sadly there's no ""Wow"" left :(","I've been a huge fan of Mariah Carey since her Vision of Love release in 1989. Although she may never be able to recreate the pure vocal power of that album, she certainly can work on her material and singing techniques.The material on Charmbracelet is pretty poor and sounds more like material that would be on a newcomer's debut album. Sadly, she ""breath-sings"" her way through 95% of the album and fails to engage the full power of voice.Don't get me wrong - this review is OF THE ALBUM, not Mariah herself. I still think she is a fabulous entertainer, but how many more breathy ""do do do do doot doot doos"" can someone take? Come on Mariah...release a full vocal power album and ""Wow"" us once again..."
1,WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MARIAH?,"Guys, this is a horrible album. Exactly the same in sound and rhyme as her previous two. That is not the mark of a top pop diva. I completely agree with the review here which says ""What would have made a good album"" because Ms Carey definitely needs to get her act together.The song with Jay-Z is the only tolerable one!"
1,Disappointed - Not her best,I have listened to Mariah Carey since I was a little girl. This CD is by far at the bottom of the list. I just felt like she was lacking emotion and heart. Maybe this was made when she was going through tough times or something?!
2,An anti-climax,"This LP, although overtly anticipated by me, just does not deliver. With the exclusions of ""Through The Rain"", ""Boy (I Need You)"" and ""Bringing On The Heartache"", this album lacks the POP PUNCH of Mariah's latest releases. The near to silent vocals on this album do not compare with Mariah's ability. An ability that she has shown with great force in the past.I adore Mariah, I could hug her now, but I must not allow such a flat album to go without the proper critique. In trying to gain street credit, Mariah has become Jennifer Lopez's prodigy. I'm terribly dissapointed with this project. Having loved ""Glitter"", and the single ""Loverboy"", I would suggest the latter, as opposed to this LP. The rap has to go, Mariah's vocal should be the focal point of all tracks."
2,Poor Quality,"I like the design, display and functions of this clock compared to others, but it is poorly made. The buttons on the front that you will probably use every day to snooze, light the display and turn the alarm on and off are difficult to press. It sometimes takes several pushes to change the display. The alarm itself is a bit jarring and does not start quietly and ascend in volume, it starts loud and just beeps faster the longer you leave it on. I would have rated this one star but it is slightly better than my previous clock. I am still looking for a good quality atomic clock with an ascending alarm."
1,Controls are poor,The controls are horrible for this game. I dont know who decision it was for the player to constantly control the camera while fighting at the same time. The grapics are good as well as the transforming but I wouldnt go near this game due to the controls.
1,Camera DESTROYS this game for me...,Could have been a fun GTA style game... however the annoying camera just zoomed in way to frequently and just ruined the game for me... I'll never play it again. Now every time I look at other action games like this... I'm always worrying they'll have a problem like this.I was so upset that there was no camera handling options. 1 star.Lesson learned... read reviews or rent games first before buying.
3,Great spectations.... too hard to play for my kids,"I love transformers... love the program since I was 12 (I believe... don't remember exactly), I have a 4 year old son and I will like him to love the franchise like I do. This movie was his first time in a movie theater and he like the experience a lot... but the game is very hard for him to play it... I try it too but even I find it difficult to play it, the camera movement is very difficult to maintain and the game is too hard even for me."
3,Ugh...,"The camera is TERRIBLE.The missions are repetitive.Combat becomes almost entirely melee, which sucks.Each character is way to alike on the Autobot side.Has a high requirement for Wii Remote motion, in other words, it isn't responsive.Badly adapted to the movie."
2,Gratuitous eye candy,"The game will give some 7 and 8 year olds some ooh and ahh momements as they get to control some of the characters that they have seen in the various Transformer movies, but apart from that, it is really better rented, or bought as a used product."
2,They BADLY TRANSFORMED,"This game graphic is good compared to other Wii games. I like the fighting scenes even though they're short. It might be because I'm not a hard cored gamer. However, the frustrating control makes this game boring after 2 missions. For example, while I was in a car form, I could not reverse! I had to transform into the robot to go backward. While fighting, a lot of times I moved the Wii remote as instructed by the manual but I got no response!After playing it for 45 minutes, I gave up. I saved $27 dollars by renting it."
4,Boys love the game,My boys wanted this game over the other Wii Transformer games. They love to play this game and love te graphics better too.
3,Okay book,"Reprinted as ""The Tank Lords"" (see there) with a few extra bits thrown in. Reads easily, although I cannot help wondering how the regiment manages to survive, losing troops and material at such a prodiguous rate."
1,Former Bush-Cheney aide,"Written by former Bush-Cheney aide, this is more whitehouse propaganda. The author also hosted an online Q & A on the whitehouse website. http://www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20040130.html"
5,Great read--honest impression of working in the White House,"This was finally what I have been waiting for. A look inside the Bush White House from someone who wasn't trying to spin the reader. The other reviewer needs a clue. He hosted Ask the White House when he worked there, moron, like many on staff are asked to do. To me, that just makes him all the more credible. I can't wait for his next book!"
5,Nice for cooking side dishes,"I use this pan for side dishes like veggies or making gravy. Don't use this pan as often as my 2 1/4 quart dutch oven because the saucier pan is much heavier, harder to handle, and I don't have as much need for it as the dutch oven. With the 2 1/4 dutch oven you can make soup to serve 4. Still give this pan 5 stars because its a Le Creuset!"
3,2012,"Pros - Cooks fantastic. Feels great. Good shipping packaging and time in transit.Cons - Along the lip most of the area is a silver texture. There are some black spots and a line or two that run perpendicular to the lip which look like a clamp or the mold was in this area. Anyone know if this is normal with Le Creuset cookware? Or should the area on the lip of the pan be uniform and 100% silver in texture?Besides the cosmetic imperfections the pan is great. But, I am OCD enough and have PAID enough I would have expected perfection unless this is the way all Le Creuset pans are due to how they are made, as this is my first."
4,WORKS FOR ME,"I really have to laugh at some of the negative reviews of Hiromi. Seems like some people just want to put her in a box and say play THIS like THIS. What exactly is the problem with her doing what she's doing? So she might not be a jazz purist, BIG DEAL!! You stuffy types need to get over yourselves already. If she lacks soul or that extra something then give her time, she's still quite young and will only get better. The talent IS there! Does Ahmad Jamal not know a good piano player when he hears one?If Hiromi wants to add some electronic keys to her sound, let her, it's HER music. I don't think they detract from her sound. There are plenty of artists out there playing pure traditional jazz for the ones who want to walk around with their snobby attitudes. Dennis Chambers is one of the best drummers around and I've heard some people complain that he can't swing. Yeah, and?!?!?!?![...]"
4,Amazing Piano Player,"She is among the best piano players I've ever heard in my life. I like the track titled ""Joy"". I'm totally immersed on the music. As another Telarc release, the hybrid SACD has a very good quality. Really recommended to be played in 6 channel discrete."
2,Hiromi,"Her music with more guitar of late around 2006/7 is stronger as just piano trios are rather limited these days unless they're EST(Esbjorn Svensson)Nevertheless switches to one hand on other electric keyboards cleverly,and knows a good range of slower moods to go with the lightning fast,a great world artiste to add to the jazz range."
3,"Great chops, but not much jazz","This classically-trained pianist has an astounding technique on the piano. However, maybe because she is so young, she seems not to have absorbed some jazz essentials like phrasing, swing and rhythmic feel. If she does absorb these elements, she will have a limitless technique to draw upon to express herself.Her strength, rather than improvisation, seems to be in perfectly executing the written-out sections of music.Personally, much of the album, which occupies the smooth-jazz to fusion spectrum, is not to my taste. However, with the support of the Telarc label and the same booking agency as Ahmad Jamal and The Bad Plus, Hiromi will have more than enough opportunity to develop and grow in different directions."
5,Lego Candy,"Candy was a big hit at our daughter-in-law to be's bridal shower. Everyone got a kick out of the fact that the pieces fit together, especially our grandson. Five pound amount provided each guest with a nice party treat. Nice blend of tart/sweet proved to be quite tasty. Shipment arrived on time. Would definitely order again."
5,Absolutely excellent,"This album gives a picture of the cultural diversity Canada offers.I liked it all: musique quebecoise, music from the First Nations,country-like sounds, Celtic rhythms...a delightful trip through avery varied world of harmony."
5,Nice training board,"I really like this board's stiffness and design. The pool where I used to train had these boards freely available to use and I liked this style. When I moved to my current home the pool here had no boards at all, so after much research decided to stick with what I'm used to. Glad I was able to find one at a good price."
5,This is one of the BEST animal books I've ever read!!!!!!!!,"This is a book you have to read if you really love animals. It is a thrilling story of a half wolf half dog named Baree. He was accidentally seperated from his father, Kazan, and his blind wolf mother, Gray Wolf. He must then learn how to hunt and survive on his own. On his journey he encounters beavers, owls, bears, and more. He eventually learns trust, loyalty, and love when he encounters Nepeese, a young, beautiful, part Cree, part French young woman. You have to read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not for Heavy Cases,"I put two of these on a 70# Pelican 1650 case. One the third trip through the highly mechanized world of air transport, one looked fairly bent up. On its immediate return trip back home, it disappeared off the case. The case is intact (other than a constant addition of new scars), but the lock's gone.I've lost two other similar cable locks - off a much smaller/lighter case - and have come to the opinion that such cable locks aren't made robustly enough for actual TSA-based passage. I'm waiting on delivery of two larger, solid shackle models that, I hope, will stay put.I'm sure Godzilla's gastro-intestinal tract is less demanding than the conveyors & gorillas at the airports. TSA padlocks should be made to survive either. Either that or they should sell these in packs of a dozen..."
4,Pelilock,This lock was purchased for a hard case that is shipped across the U.S. every week. Normal hard padlocks were getting damaged and the combination cylinders bent so we couldn't get the lock opened. This type of lock was suggested and although we haven't started using it yet assume it will work to our satisfaction.
2,Whoa!,I say $5.95 to ship a $10 item is a bit steep for my wallet. I'd suggest Amazon carry this item themselves so that buyers don't get ripped off by this kind of thing.
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"Wow. I had a couple of TSA-access Pelilocks for years that were pretty sturdy. Unfortunately, one of them didn't make the last flight home with me (hey, thanks TSA!). Those original locks seem to be unavailable now - I searched everywhere including ebay. So I thought I'd try these. Obviously, any TSA accessible locks are going to provide only marginal security, but these seem to me to be exceptionally flimsy. I don't know what the alternative is, but you'd probably find a better lock at Walmart."
3,Not exactly what I ordered...,"When I ordered these, the wrong item was pictured. I thought I was getting the locks with the solid bar rather than the cable, and I thought they had four digits in the combination rather than three. To the seller's credit, he did call before shipping to let me know that they were the style with the cable, but he didn't mention that my combinations would be an order of magnitude weaker. On the other hand, I didn't specifically ask, so I suppose I can't slam him too hard.As luggage locks they are probably fine for travel - I mean the main point is to keep honest people honest. Unfortunately, I also wanted to use them to keep children out of certain containers, and probably won't be using them for this as the combination is a bit weak for that. Now I'm just getting a safe with a six digit combo."
4,Plays multichannel DVD-Audio and burned DVD-R's,"After reading some of the previous reviews, I wanted to state that this player definitely plays back multichannel DVD-Audio discs. If you're only hearing sound out of 2 speakers, then there must be a setting you need to change in the setup menu.Also, I've burned many DVD-R's on various DVD burners (not Panasonic branded) and they've all played back flawlessly on this Panasonic DVD-F87S player.Haven't had any problems with this player and I've owned it for 18 months now."
5,"Wow, What a Sound!","This Panasonic DVD player has the best sound I've ever heard out of a DVD player. The Multi Remaster feature is wonderful, allowing CDs sampled at 44.1 kHZ to be played at 88.2 kHZ (sounding almost as good as DVD-Audio) with my reciever. By the way, it also supports DVD-Audio 6 channel, but this is incompatible with the coaxial out (only stereo sound) and only compatible if your reciever has 5.1 inputs for each speaker. It also allows you to turn off the video circuitry for the highest quality sound with Audio CDs, MP3s, and WMAs.The worst part of this DVD player is its video quality. It isn't bad, it just isn't anything to write home about. With the drastic improvement in sound quality, you'd expect the same increase in video quality.This DVD player supports CD-A, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD-RAM, MP3, WMA, and commerical DVDs. It plays DVD+R great even though it is not listed as a feature."
1,Do They QA These Things?,"Like another reviewer, I had a Panasonic 5 disk DVD player but that one lasted 5 years. Based on that experience, I purchased this one. Unlike my previous model, this one's metal screw that holds/spins the turn table is raised above the height of the 5 DVD slots. If one of the DVDs pops out it will be ruined by that screw head...as what happened to a disk that is no longer sold. It is experiences like this that will prevent me from buying from a particular manufacturer like Panasonic again."
2,"NO DVD-A MULTICHANNEL, otherwise beautiful performance","The machine is well above average in terms of being an excellent progressive scan player. However, I received a slap in the face when I realized that my dream DVD-Audio player of over a year infact does not support DVD-A multichannel. This is mentioned only once in the manual as a miniscule note. I had been racking my brain trying to figure out why I could easily play DVD-A stereo, but not multichannel. I connected the unit via the ""5.1"" analog outs, which I now assume to be short for Dolby 5.1 only. If you own one of these, take some solace in knowing that your DVD-A multichannel discs are probably not poorly authored."
3,"Good, But............",This player has good sound and picture. It is comvinient to combine the cd & dvd players to save room. However like another reviewer said the manual sucks. I have had this 2 months and I still havent' figured out how to shuffle and program cd's. The manual says you can. But it doesn't say how!It also doesn't have a counter like every other cd and dvd player I have had. So for these 2 reasons I can only give it a 3 star rating.
3,I'nm just Not sure... Sony stink I know!,"After having every Sony Product under $1500 I buy fail and die, so quickly after their warranty is up, I've tossed my hands in the air, and bough this panasonic today.I was looking for a Yamaha.Anything, to get away from SONY!RRRRR!Literally, over ten grand, down the drain!Well, this Panasonic connected, and worked immediately, and seemed to have an instantly better picture than the Sony it replaced (whose original japanese remote batteries are still alive and well). We'll see.I'm seeing all these other complaint about Panasonic motor faults.I don't care.It CANNOT be worse than the SONY motor FAULTS!IT CANNOT POSSIBLY!I'll report back, if, there's anything to report......pete"
3,NIce unit but........................,Nice unit but it will only play DVD-R if they are recorded using a Panasonic DVD recorder or a camcorder. The description is a little misleading. But other then that nice picture and sound.
1,craptastic,"within a week of using this piece of shiznit, the dvd door opened and then jammed and wouldn't close. Pick a different product. this one sucks."
1,Hard to rate; didn't arrive in working order.,"It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box. The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would get 'trapped' inside the unit. And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether. Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should. If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully; a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one. Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances."
1,Defective design,"I am just another sufferer of the Panasonic H07 error. Unless you want to spend your cash on a player that is likely to die in a year, avoid Panasonic - especially the changers.Google ""Panasonic H07 error"" and you will know what I mean."
2,Decent when it worked right,"Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again. It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to ""reset"" and work correctly. It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working.Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand."
1,Panasonic MP3 playback,"I purchased the Panasonic DVD-F87 player in part because the literature said it played MP3 files. Unfortunately, the player inserted an audible blip between many of the MP3 songs, so I returned it and got the Panasonic S47 model. It had the same problem. MP3 discs that played fine on several computer drives, a Sony DVD player and a Phillips portable CD player would hiccup between songs on the Panasonic. Panasonic denied they had a problem, and tried to blame it on Roxio's MP3-burning software, but one of Panasonic's authorized repair facilities told me that Panasonic's MP3 reader is buggy and that Panasonic has not provided a fix (as of September 2004). So, if MP3 playback is important to you, steer away from Panasonic players."
4,"Excellent Player, terse manual, can't play DVD-MP3",I have had this player for over two weeks now and it has performed quite well. This is an excellent player for the price. It played some damaged DVDs better than other players I had tried.I am giving this 4 stars due to the quality of the manual. The manual is too terse and not really well laid out.I was also little disappointed that the player is able to show the MP3 files located on a DVD+R but can't play them.
4,"good, multifeatured product","Reviews trashing this item appear to be the work of a few diehards that got burned at some point. This is a good machine that has so many bells and whistles they can't be listed here. Poor manual given the ""bells etc"" but you can get there.I got mine for CD play primarily. DVD is a freebie in my mind. I used the $30 discount for signing up for a Amazon credit card. A no-brainer at $80. total!Panasonic is a good brand, other reviewers (Consumers Reports for one) give it good marks. And, yes, it does play DVD+R discs although not listed on the box.Made in Singapore vs. China so, hopefully, it won't be a 6 month throwaway."
3,"Great series, but defective discs.","I read the other reviews before purchasing this set. After seeing the dates of the posted reviews, I was hoping the problem would be fixed by now. Unfortunately, I am experiencing the same issues with disc 2. Its been a while since I have watched a Gundam series, and had forgotten how fast paced and engaging the series can be. So far I am very impressed with SEED. I would give it more stars if all the discs played."
2,Great Show Crap DVDs,This is the best Gundam i've seen yet. I really like the characters and the drama between the two friends having to fight one another. The story behind Kira Yamato makes it more realistic that he can just jump in a pilot the Gundam without any military training. It is just like every other Gundam series but this is one I would watch over and over again.The bad part is that Bandai is a terrible company in my eys (at least with the manufacture of dvds). I've read so many reviews of various other anime series that have defective discs. So far disc 5 will only work in my computer and only the first 3 episodes work. Disc 2 and 4 only read a few episodes in all my dvd players and my computer. I have had no luck trying to contact Bandai for replacments by e-mail or phone. I would have rated this a 5 because the series is one the best animes i've ever seen but because of Bandai and it terrible customer service and product quality I gave it a low raiting.
1,Bad Discs,Ok seeing the reviews here I can see why so many people are upset about this DVD box set. I have both sets of this series and I have to admit. I cant play them on my computer so I switch to a Playstation 2 and even then ONLY 1 DISC fully worked. I made it to episode 9 before I was told unable to read disc.How is it you can sell a faulty disc and not think about reviewing this issue. Needless to say I am unable to return the faulty sets due to the fact I finally recieved them the SAME WEEK the return policy went up. Guess that is just a defect of being stationed in Iraq.Either way I am out 60 bucks cause your company obviously does not think that quality is better than quantity.
2,"great show, messed up discs","Like my title, the show is great, but I have returned two sets with the same results. The discs are scratched and the shows stutter. I am very dissapointed. Please take my advice and steer clear of this set for now. You will regret getting an anime you can't watch because of such a horrible packaging job."
3,hmmmmmmmmmmmmm,"Well, this DVD set is a nice concept and all, but like previous reviews I to have had problems with the fifth disk. I got through all the other disks with no problem and even got through the first 3 episodes of the fifth disk but then it wouldn't play the last 2. Rather dissappointing when you're so close to the end.I would say pass this set up since bandai has faulty disks in this set. One idea for people to do is to buy this set and then just buy the fifth disk by itself but that would only be assuming that they don't fix this set up. For the most part the faulty disk is just the fifth one but a few people have had trouble more than just the fifth.The show itself isn't the best in the gundam series, it's filled with way to much drama for my tastes, but none the less is still a good anime. If the set didn't carry faulty disks I would say buy it but think about it before you do."
1,Disc Errors,"Just to confirm -- I too received faulty discs. Amazon was good enough to send me a replacement set of DVDs (thanks Amazon!) but because I think a significant percentage of the discs are defective, those discs too were faulty."
1,Discs still Bad,I ordered this item from one of Amazon's affiliates. I specifically asked that it not be shipped to me if the problems with bad discs had not been corrected. They shipped it anyway and the first disc I tried to play wouldn't even load in my player. How can Bandai get away with dumping a load of defective discs in the marketplace and not recalling them?
5,Adorable and engaging!,"This is a great book to read to infants. The pull-tab system is much less vulnerable to rips than lift-the-flap, and the very simple story remains clever. A spin in the washing machine for Teddy is my favorite part."
3,"Doesn't work with the 15"" Powerbook","The case is a nice idea, but it doesn't work with the 15"" Powerbook. The area inside the case is not wide enough for the computer to sit centrally with the power cord plugged in. If you leave the power supply inside as they show in the pictures, you will have an unsightly power cord emerging from the front of the pocket whenever the computer is charging. The case is also very large on the outside and is quite heavy."
2,Too bad about the zipper...,"I bought this item despite having read the reviews about the zipper getting stuck, hoping that it wouldn't be a problem on mine. The zipper was terrible, though - the material of the zipper is stretchy, not sturdy. The zipper got stuck the very first time I tried it, so I returned it. Too bad, because the case looks great and has useful features otherwise. Hopefully Belkin will revise the product's design in the future."
5,Very useful--a great start for the budget traveller,"I recently finished a road trip across the country. This book came in handy every step of the way, from making reservations for lodgings to finding places to eat once we got there.Understand that this book doesn't have eveything. There's not enough space in one book for too much detail on any one place. And it primarily (with some exceptions) covers only the largest cities in each state.But it's a great way to get started planning a trip. I made many of my best lodging and eating choices of my trip based on this book."
3,Interesting as a historical document but not as a novel,"This novel truly captures the spirit of the 1968 'revolutions'---the sheer narcissism and self-indulgence of the 'revolutionaries' is captured, although, one suspects, not intentionally. As a snapshot of 60s Paris and London, it is an interesting, but slight, novel."
2,Poor quality transfer but great music,The DVD quality is very poor. Most of the performances from the 60s can be found on other DVDs with superb quality. Don't waste your money on this!
4,"Amazing Grace - A Country Salute to Gospel, Vol 1",Very well done. I especially enjoy the variety of artists and singing styles. I'd recommend this to anyone.
4,"Not Bad At All,","This is a pretty decent cd. The music is beautifully done and it is awesome. It might be a little slow, but it is relaxing. there is only one song i really liked on this cd and it is, Wich Of Couse, Amazing Grace."
2,Huge Dissappointment,"I got this CD for Christmas after hoping for it for months. What a dissapointment! The tempo on this whole CD is *really slow* - it is draggy and depressing. Instead of upbeat and inspiring renditions of my favorite gospel songs, I got a too slow, morse recording. Where is the joy of praising God in these recordings? This CD is more like a funeral dirge than a joyful noise. I am very sad - such great artists, so much talent, but the songs just aren't very good."
1,Look elsewhere,"Great set of songs, poorly sung. Very slow. I wonder if the artists who sung on this CD want you to hear what they recorded? It certainly is not them at their best."
3,Not like new,"The CD had one small scratch so it was not ""like new."" The rest of the CD was okay. Disappointed in the one scratch."
2,Universal Sequels,"Universal was the premier leader of horror until the end of the 50s. They created seveal horror classics that have stood the test of time. One of these was the Wolf Man, which spawned these two sequels with several others as well. As for Werewolf in London, the transformation scenes are cool, but on She Wolf we don't get to see the werewold makeup/ transformation. I thought both were worth a look, but I didn't get my money's worth- don't think it was worth what I paid for it, but not really bad movies."
4,It is an Odd Pairing,"Unlike others in reviewing this strange pair of films, I liked She-Wolf of London better than Werewolf Of London. Both are Ok, neither are great but the story of the she-wolf engrossed me. It is not a monster movie but a murder mystery but I enjoyed all performances and June Lockhart was very engaging as the troubled young woman. Werewolf of London is truly a monster movie. A man is attacked by a werewolf in Tibet and then brings it home to his family. Werewolves in this movie always try to kill the people he loves best so he is very rough on his wife."
4,ONE GOOD HORROR FILM AND ONE OK MURDER MYSTERY!,This is deceiving double bill as only one film features a werewolf and they are not related to each other. The first one 'The Werewolf Of London' is an early werewolf story and is very good. The other is a murder mystery which is OK. Both these films can be found on the Wolfman Legacy Collection DVD set included with two other werewolf films. The transfers are very good and there are some interesting extras.
2,Nothing to howl about,"Werewolf of London/She-Wolf of London is a classic black and white duo. I'm a big fan of werewolf films so, it was nice to see where it all started. Werewolf of London was the better film. She-wolf was quite simply: a. too short, and b: not a monster movie.While I liked the feature, (Werewolf of London ), the film doesn't have much re-watch value. I mean, how many times can you watch the transformation scenes? Also, the 'hero' was rather unlikable. This film would be different if he cooperated with the other scientist and searched for a cure, instead of being a so selfishly boneheaded.I recommend these films for old monster movie buffs. But for me, I just forced myself to finish it."
5,wonderful book,"I read this book a long time ago, but it is a good book. Catherine Cookson is a excellent author. It is unreal the cruelty orphan children went through in the last century. They were treated like slaves."
4,Slow Awakening,I like any books by Cathrine Cookson (Merchant) She is a fabulous story teller. Too bad her booksare not widely sold in the US When visiting UK I always pick up what ever I can find
4,The Slow Awakening,This is a must read classic for all Cookson fans! Original book was published under her maiden name so it is not as commonly heard of.
2,Flimsier than it looks,"I was surprised at the flimsyness of this product. The sides are very thin. The pieces of the sides rattle. The lid is substantial, but I can't imagine anyone sitting on this.Also, our front piece arrived slightly damaged. Unfortunatly we don't have the time to return it."
4,Toy box,The address was given correctly but the shipper misread my address and there was difficulty in UPS delivering it. They tried 3 times but did not call the phone number given with it. When I realized that the item was late I called and made the correction and then it was delivered without difficulty. The product itself is very nice and exactly what we wanted. This inattention to detail caused me extra work and anxiety in the pre Christmas rush season.
3,"Mall Robbed, news at 11","This is a decent made for TV action movie. It takes lessons from Willis and Schwarzenegger on how to shoot enormous rounds of bullets, make lots of explosions, and kill bad guys in a number of ways. Dean Cain as the off duty suspended cop and Eric Roberts as the level headed leader of the heist team. The robbers are after a large amount of money transferred to the bank from the mall on Christmas Eve. All the actors are reasonably good at their roles. The acting is above par for most B actioners and the story is plausible and the characters lines are done well enough you don't feel abused with giving it the time to watch. For a price below ten dollars it will make a nice inexpensive gift for most men. The DVD is fair quality but does not include extras."
3,"Not good, but tries","In this movie (produced for cable network TBS, when it was still a superstation), Dean Cain stars as a Chicago cop who accidentallykills a Chinese businessman, and gets suspended. But, however,a team of robbers who are trying to rob money from a mall, putsCain back into the game, taking his wife (Erika Eleniak), anothermom and her two kids hostage, before Christmas nears. Has a fewlessons in between, but not so good as we thought it would be.You film buffs should know:There is a poster for ""The One"" (Sony, who distributed this,owns the producer of that film)."
1,waste of shelf space,"Technical quality? Terrible. Content? stupid. You're watching it and thinking ""this guy is hosting a TV show- how stupid."" It's just a bunch of TV shows with the commercials taken out all put together. Not very entertaining. Try ""Coral Sea Dreaming"""
4,migration policy,"This is an excellent introduction to ethical issues in migration and immigration. Almost all of the essays are of a high quality, and a number of different views are presented. A few of the essays are disapointing, and some are perhaps misleadingly labled, but over-all this is the best introduction to issues in the migration of money and people that I know of. I highly recommend it to people interested in political philosophy, immigration law and policy, or globalization."
3,Sexmagick 2 : Men Conjuring Erotic Fantasy,"This was an enlightening book, and without giving too much away, I can honestly say that it works! Simple, and at a point of view that everyone can relate too. Enjoy..."
4,Not Bad,"For the price, this product is pretty good. Yes, it is rather cheaply constructed, but if you're a beginner or even a pro looking for a cheap shoulder rest, this is a good choice. I can't find another on the internet that is this cheap. However, be warned: it is a bit flimsy, the adjustment nuts for width are plastic and can easily be stripped if you're not careful. I almost did that when I first got it. If you are looking for a product that will be durable and last a long time, consider another rest. But if you are just getting started, this is an excellent choice. Why spend tons of money outfitting a beginner if you're not sure he/she will stick with it?"
2,A slow-jam from TRF...so far off the mark of a TRF track.,"The 20th CD single ""TRY OR CRY"" was the first CD single not produced by TK or a famous music producer.The song had it's chance to become a full on slow-jam but with the mid-tempo bass going on throughout the song, the song becomes more of a mid-tempo groove that seemed like another YU-KI-centric song.Although ""Hey! Ladies and Gentlemen"" seemed as a major departure for TRF music-wise, at least the song sounded like a TRF song.For me ""TRY OR CRY"" doesn't.It's definitely more adult contemporary and it sounds more like something that I would hear from Nakamori Akina not TRF.Not to say it's a bad song but it's so different from any TRF song that I heard.It just strays to far from what makes their music so energetic and beautiful.Despite it being different, on it's own, it's alright but for a TRF song, it felt out of place."
5,H.E. Atkins,"He was an amatuer mathmatics teacher born in 1872, Leicester,England. He could have been a grandmaster and was as strong as Burn, Blackburn and Napier. His games were easy to understand and very logical. He was known for his fighting spirit and defeated such players as Burn,Marshall,Rubenstein,Blackburn,Yates and many others. I love this little old book. Anyone from ELO 1100 to 2200 will injoy this collection of games from one of the forgotton players from the past."
2,Plastic handles too soft for heavy use,I've had both the standard and metric sets for over a year now. The T handle is very convenient. But be aware that you have to be careful not to put too much torque on the handle. The plastic will give and the wrench (or key)just spins in the plastic. With care these are very good for light household use.
5,"Finally, real rock n roll.","In an age of reality shows and a music-less MTV, the Supersuckers are a rare treasure indeed. There are other bands out there that claim to be rock n roll, but none of them can hold a guitar to the guys from Seattle, via Tuscon.Admittedly, I was a smidge disappointed with ""MF's Be Trippin'"" in the fact that I found it kind of boring in spots, but my faith is renewed in ""Paid."" How many times can you say a bands umpteenth release may be their best? Not too damn many.The Supersuckers may have done it.Great songs, great musicianship, and with the e.p., an overall great idea.I rarely get this excited over a rock n roll band, but the boys deliver time and time again. Honestly, do yourself a favor.Don't buy the $13 mocha-latte tomorrow at CrapBucks and buy ""Paid.""You'll thank me for it."
1,"Don't buy this, wait until they put the songs on the LP","This is a joke. There are really only four songs on this ep. Five and six are different versions of old songs that sounded fine the first time and show an utter lack of creativity. The price, then, for four songs is outrageous. Besides, Eddie stated they were going to release about three eps and collect the songs onto one album. So you can spend $8.00 each for three eps and $14 on the LP for a total of $38.00. Yeah, right. Stupid releases like this are a big part of why people bootleg music. Wait for the LP and pay 99 cents on iTunes for any useful tracks they withold from the LP."
2,Not up to par.,"I hate to say this but this e.p. is a let down. They mixed in a couple ""country"" songs which I hate, if I want a country album (never will happen) I'll buy one. They shouldn't combine rock and country songs, I thought this was a rock record. Plus, the rock songs are weak, not even close to their prior releases. A major let down, buy a old cd, pass on this one. Let's hope the next record will live up to their high standards, not like this one which sucks, plain and simple."
5,five stars,when i first got the plane i was afrade that the black rod would slide out but it dident! i was amased when my brother smashed it into a house and it was barly scratched. it has a long wing-spand so it glids veary well. when i first got it i has some problems with the badery so i had to make 2 thrips to the store but other then that it totaly rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,#5 is One of the Best so far!,"I started reading this series 6 days ago and I just finished the fifth book and let me tell you that the ""The Sacrifice"" and ""Goddess of the Moon"" are the best out of the bunch. Ewing wrote each book from a different point of view. One moment Vanessa is the one telling her life, then in the next book WHAM! your in Serena's head. These books are awesome! I think that giving Stanton his own book really turned my mind. I enjoyed the love and the hate and most of all the magic binding everything and everyone. This book sort reminds me of ""Romeo and Juliet"". In simple terms guys this book is a must READ!"
5,Daughters Of the Moon #5: The Sacrifice,"This is the second best book so far in the series. I think all of us ladies wish Stanton or someone like him were real, and willing to do anything for your safety and well-being. Oh well, a girl can dream can't she?"
2,Not as great as it could be.,"I purchased the Sony ZSY3 cd boombox and was not at all impressed. The bass sounds ""tinny"" and over vibrates and sounds so unreal. Don't waste your money on this one. Overpriced and skimpy on features. You don't even get a cassette player on this one. It has a sleep timer function but no alarm function. No mp3 compatibility. The backlit lcd is so small. With each new model they bring out the lcd gets smaller and smaller. You are better off with last year's model CFD E95LIV. Now that one is a nice one for the price. Sony has discontinued that model but some merchants might still have stock on it."
4,Annoying without being the sellers fault.,"The item is nice... 7 tracks worth listening to, especially if you like The Streets...Item arrived the day after I waned it for which was slightly disappointing but hey, it came in the time frame suggested."
5,The frustrations of a Black-white collar worker,...as a Black-white collar worker have having willingly and concientiously taken part in America's leading social preoccupation..an experiment called 'Integration'...I am compelled to assess my total experience by saying ...Integration is a Bitch!
4,"Smaller than I thought it would be, but still fun!","I bought this for my 19month old daughter who LOVES horses. She's very pleased with it although it's smaller than I was expecting it to be. I think the 12"" must be measured from the nose to the tip of the tail while extended because the horse is shorter and thinner than I was expecting. It's a good carrying size for her stature though."
2,Very low budget,"I thought I would enjoy this film, because I have always like Brooke Adams. This movie was low budget and that really didn't hurt it until the end. They really should have shelled out a few bucks and at least provided some good effects during the last 20 minutes. What they has was just cheesy.The premise: a fertility clinic doctor is impregnating women with genetically altered semen in an attempt to create ""super"" humans. Bad part? The fetuses are prone to violence, starting with mom.I really can't recommend this at all. Very sad."
4,Excellent horror.,"Brooke Adams vs. psycho fetus created by wacko doctor James Karen in an attempt to breed superhumans. Good suspense, good acting and good scares. Docked a star only for the absurd fetus-killing-victims-one-by-one plot development. A must see if you like horror."
3,From the mouth of the brother of Jesus,"I love contrary stuff, and this is contrary in bulk. I'm sure that a Christian reader will ignore these quotes of Jesus and they will not shake their faith, but for non-believers...this is ammunition.To be born again is to die and be born as the opposite sex. Interesting..."
2,Unreadable,"Okay, I know Bandler and Grinder are the originators of NLP, but they can't write readable copy to save their lives. Unless you are a true NLP geek, don't waste your money on this unless you want to spend your time scratching your head saying ""Is there something I'm missing here?"" There are NLP books that are practical and helpful and can even be used by therapists. This is not one of them. I'm sure in person their classes are excellent and I am grateful for their contribution, but not for this book."
1,Voodoo Witch Doctor Kindergarten Hypnosis!,"I have been a professional psychologist and hypnotherapist for over thirty years. In my professional opinion, NLP as created by Grinder and Bandler, (which they learned from an M.D. psychiatrist named Milton Erickson) is the most misleading dis-empowering form of hypnotherapy ever created. You will not learn how to do hypnosis or hypnotherapy from this book."
5,Want to use language to your benefit? Get this book.,"Not only is this book entertaining, the authors can't helpbut employ the same verbal techniques that they are teaching.This way, you learn by example both consciously and unconsciously.The appendix has an outline version of the various patterns onecan employ.I borrowed this from the library and I'm justtired of not being able to refer to such a gem so as soon as Ifinish this review, I'll be purchasing it, too.Please feel free toemail me for comments or conversation."
4,"Top ""how to"" hypnosis info, easy reading, and humorous too!","If you're looking for a guide to the structure of hypnoticlanguage or techniques, and you need practical exercisesand loads of examples, this is for you! Compiled from theirseminars, Grinder and Bandler give an enjoyable performancewhile enlightening their readers with anecdote, metaphor,and example. Definitely a ""must have"" for beginning throughadvanced students of hypnosis and NeuroLinguistic Programming."
5,Brilliant book for those interested in learning Hypnosis.,"An excellent ""how-to"" book packed with loads of practical exercises. A very new look at a very old practice. After reading and applying the information in this book, anyone can learn how to hypnotise, and how to utilise this skill to help yourself, and others to get what they want.Top marks!"
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointed. I was looking for a book that would offer solutions instead of telling me how having children will make for a poor marriage. After reading the first two chapters, then you have read the book, the rest was just filler material. The book had an overall negative message."
1,Wrong.,"Sadly, this is not a catalogue of methods of contraception or abortion clinics.It thereby misses out on vital first steps in the babyproofing of a marriage."
2,"If everyone read this book, nobody would have children.","This book is heavy on the ""horror stories"" but offers few solutions. The authors seem to delight in telling you how horrible your marriage will become. You have to slog through pages and pages of negative, bitter, depressing anecdotes from parents to get to the one paragraph at the end that says, ""be appreciative, be affectionate, communicate, have sex."" See, I just saved you the time of reading the book.It would've been better if they had included more positive, helpful advice and solutions to marriage problems. Instead, they make all women seem like controlling, nagging harpies, and paint men as insensitive deadbeats who would rather do anything than take care of their children. You're left wondering if you should even have children, if this is the nightmare your life is going to be! I wasn't expecting (or wanting) them to sugarcoat it, but would a little encouragement and optimism wouldn't have hurt."
2,only for those trapped in tradition,"this book offers great advice if your marriage conforms to traditional stereotypes. (i.e. he works, she stays at home). nearly all of the challenges that are highlighted in the book deal with issues like ""he's working too late and is tired when he gets home"" and ""she's cleaning all day and needs a break when hubby gets home"". it was not useful for us at all. we both work and try very hard to distribute professional and domestic duties equally."
4,Great book and would definitely recommend it.,"Overall I thought this book was great for new moms/dads, regardless of whether you are expecting your first child, just had your first child, or have two toddlers (my case). There was so much I got out of the book, but mainly learning that we are not alone in our marital issues. I actually felt a sense of relief after only reading the first few pages (yes, I am a martyr, a scorekeeper, etc). The authors provide some good tips on how to not play these types of games with your spouse. Also, I enjoyed reading many of the quotes/testimonials from the men, as it helped shed some light into how they think. Again, good book...I think it's worth picking up or even buying as a gift for soon-to-be or new parents."
4,Anecdotal stories to make you feel better about being a new parent,"The stories in this book really helped me feel more ""normal"" as a new parent, and not so crazy. I also learned my husband is more loving and helpful than some others! A fun, informative book."
2,I could not relate... could not finish the book.,I read this book when my son was 19 months old so maybe i wasn't feeling the adjustment i felt when he was just born. I know that a new baby can put a strain on a marriage especially due to lack of sleep ... but i couldn't relate to this book. My husband helped.. and continues to help.. so i just couldn't relate enough. This is for the far end of the spectrum with husbands that hardly do a thing. i could not finish this book because i was bored. Maybe to people who can relate to this book it would be great! but not for me...
1,"Negative, Crude, and Not Helpful.","These ladies were excessively chatty, unnecessarily negative and crude! I didn't expect cussing in a book like this. My husband and I read it together and we both decided it was a waste of time and money by the time we got through chapter 3."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I am so disappointed with this book! I was really looking forward to reading it with my husband, but it is a one sided book written by three women complaining about their stereotypic husbands. I felt like the book heavily concentrating on the problems and not the solutions for marriage. We are expecting our first child right now and I decided to put it away on the bookshelf and not read it because I was getting irritated too much."
2,This book makes me not want to have kids...at all,"I honestly have started to reconsider having children. Based on what it sounds like in this book, it will be hell! I think I'll find something new to read- perhaps something more encouraging. I was looking for a little more balance in this book. It was a recommended read before having children, but steer clear if you don't have little ones yet! This book does not talk much about the upsides and definitely did not meet my expectations."
1,I Couldn't Finish It,"I feel very offended for all men who are stereotyped in this book. This really is a man-bashing book. It claims to have the male and female sides of the issue, but often the man's point of view is belittled. My husband and I are thinking of having children soon, and I wanted a book that would help us maintain our close and loving relationship while raising a child. This book is NOT it. While there are some helpful tips (don't keep score, communicate) I feel like much of it is common sense, and didn't add what what I already knew. I would never have my husband read this book, for fear that he might think I feel as the authors do towards their husbands. Waste of money. Don't bother."
5,Remembering your husband,"I really recommend this book for any new parents to be. I thought this book was so informative, yet hilarious. I totally went through a lot of things that was written. I didn't think that my son would affect my marriage, but he did. My husband felt ignored and didn't have a bonding with my son. It was very hard for him. This book really helped my marriage to get on track and gave me the ""Daddy's"" perspective. This also gave the mother's perspective too, so it's equal. We read this book everynight before we went to bed and took turns reading it. I wish there would be a part two! haha."
1,Incredibly Negative,"I definitely do NOT recommend this book!It was incredibly negative and degrading to men. As a woman, pregnant with my first child, this book made me feel like my life (and marriage) will be a living hell once the baby comes. It basically tells you that you will become a nagging, control-freak witch, your husband will be useless and will try to escape you and the baby unless he wants sex, your parents and in-laws will become raging lunatics and you'll wish you could have your old life back. Nothing at all about the love you will feel for your child or even a mention of the profound changes for the better that becoming a parent can have on your life. Save yourself the downer and skip this one!"
3,"Fun easy read, nothing you haven't heard before","I enjoyed reading this book, although it is nothing we haven't heard before, such as have a date night, don't nag, keep the love life alive, etc. It is a short, easy read that helps remind you of the basics of trying to work together and you MAY even get your husband interested in reading it too, but I doubt it."
2,Um no...,"I was anxious to read this entire book after receiving the sample on my Kindle as a mother of a 3 year old I thought some insight could be gained related to how to balance marriage and parenthood. The book started comical and seemed to be a voice I could relate to.But then it just got tedious.And the women (2 who are stay at home moms) just seemed to have a lot of mixed messages and expecting the bare minimum from their PARTNERS.Don't get me started on their views on sex. It was pretty much a ""grin and bear it"" solution...what a win-win for the men. And that ""5-minute solution"" was frankly insulting.The fact this was written by women I would have expected something a little more sensitive and realistic.Overall this book was a huge disappointment that I am actually being vocal in recommending friends and fellow WORKING mothers DO NOT READ."
3,Easy to read but a bit repetitive,"My mommy book club chose this book by my suggestion and I have to say I ended up a bit disappointed. On the positive side, it was easy to read and it had a lot of humor woven in and that was enjoyable. The thing I disliked most was that some parts were very repetitive and some chapters seemed drawn out unnecessarily. I think the authors also tended to over-generalize when comparing men and women."
1,Have not yet received this Item???,"Aloha, I purchased this Item SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY/DYING YOUNG on 7/17/09 and have not yet received it. Please advise on the date of delivery. Many Thanks Ethel Gills 808-699-5113"
5,An okd time favorite,"I love Julia Roberts. Sleeping with the Enemy ia a personal favorite. I had never seen Dying Young, so it was nice to see another of Julia's movies."
5,Great,I'm an elementary teacher and my students love this. I like that students are able to check their work and make corrections on their own. I gave this toy 4 stars for educational value because some of the cards aren't very clear about what the students are supposed to do; I have had to explain several of them to my students. I gave the durability 4 stars as well because the buttons that you slide sometimes get stuck and I have had one pop out. Overall I really recommend the Logico Board.
5,Frost King V447H Camper Mounting Tape 1-1/4-Inch by 3/16-Inch,The product was used to mount a truck cap to the bed of a 2000 Ford pick-up. Worked great and sealed prerfect. No leaks are present. Super price also.
1,Simply useless,"I bought this CD cause I am starting sound design for multimedia production. The first thing you see when you look at the box is : ""These sound effects are intended for home and private use only.""Do they think people need sound effects for their holiday's movies ?"
3,Simple air filter for monthly use,"This is an inexpensive first line home HVAC air filter used monthly, I use a HEPA filter for final air filtration."
4,filter,"Got here on time they look ok.The price was about what I used to pay. Alittle higher, but things go up some."
2,Beckers Grace,"This is a good Becker Cd. IT contains one of her best songs in ""Deep Callin Deep."" I just couldnt get into the Cd it just didnt do anything for me."
4,Great Place to Purchase CD's From,The CD I purchased wasn't exactly as described but Music For a Song was great to deal with to make my purchase FANTASTIC. They solved every issue that came up and I would purchase any other CD from them anytime!
5,A Great Movie!,This was a wonderful addition to my hubby's universal movie collection. He really enjoyed watching it and was glad to add it to his Franky collection.
2,So cute-- I wish we could figure it out!,"This alarm clock is sooo cute, and my 7 year old daughter loves it. However, I find it needs more buttons-- like a simple ""off/on"" button for the alarm. The only way to turn it off is to go through the whole process of pressing the display and setting buttons in the proper sequence so that the alarm icon eventually goes away. These are the same buttons for setting the date, time of day, 24 hour vs 12 hour clock, AM vs. PM, hours, seconds, minutes, alarm, and/or vibration, so we end up having to reset all of it every time we try to use the alarm. For a sleepy kid (and mom), this sequence is impossible. I have the manual sitting next to my bedside to read how it is supposed to work, and have my daughter bring me the ringing clock while it is going off in the morning. This is a poor situation for an alarm clock! It is cute-- but too hard to work it!"
2,It's cute but not efficient,"I bought this item for my daugther, it's really cute, but it needs batteries and I didn't know that and the time has already change on it and it's been only working 3 weeks so I am affraid that we are going to have to set it all the time so it works as an alarm. I would not get another like it."
5,I was impressed at the quality for the price,"I've read other reviews that are critical, but I thought this screen worked perfectly and was well thought out. I'm able to handle it myself, it's easy to set up and break down and it works great for in-home and professional use. I did a video for clients who were very happy with the result. I had company at home who set this up as a big-screen TV. If you need a wide aspect ratio, don't pull it down all the way. If you're doing 4:3, then go ahead and use all the screen's real estate. All in all, I think it's great value for the money. It arrived quickly as well. Now, I'd just like to find a cover for it."
4,"Nice Screen, especially for the price","I bought this screen to replace an old one that I had for 20+ years that I loaned out and never got back :(It is clearly not made as well as the old screen and won't likely last 20 years. Lots of plastic held on by friction instead of screws. But, otherwise it is a nice screen and it meets my needs. The price was right and the free shipping was even nicer."
2,Too flmishy,"I needed a screen that was lightweight as I travel with it. It is lightweight, but the materials used are very flimsy. One of the ""poles"" has a cap which has popped off. I'm very disappointed."
2,Good screen falsely advertised,"This appears to be a well made screen. But 71"" it's not -- at least the way screens seemed to be measured by every other screen manufacturer, by the length of one side of a square screen. This screen measures something like 50"" on each side, not 71"" It appears that Elite, in contrast with other manufacturers, chooses to describe its screens by their diagonal measurement. But they don't make that clear in their product description. I was looking for a screen between 60"" and 72"" on a side and this appeared ideal. Now I am forced to return it and look for a ""real"" 72"" screen. Good product, sleazy marketing"
1,poor quality,"I have tried this screen twice now and both times the product was delivered broken. Sorry, I just cant afford to try a third so I am going to look for something else. Reviews sound great and I figured that the first one was a fluke, but two in a row....The flip side is that Amazons returns policy have made it very easy for me to send this item back, so 5 star for Amazon but I cant rec'd this screen."
2,I Did Better on a Bare White Wall,"Performance of this screen was disappointing. In projecting my wife's childhood Super8 movies, running my digital camcorder behind the projector to digitize and edit the old film, the images on the screen were incredibly dim. I nearly went blind straining to see them. Before buying the screen, I had projected and digitally recorded the images off a flat-white wall in our living room. The brightness was much better, and made a better digital movie, than when using the screen. I wasted my money."
1,Terrible company to deal with,"Almost a month and no product. Typical excuse will be said, ""It had to go to all the way to HaWAII!"" Yeah it's a state right? I get products from China faster. I would not recommend these guys for anything!!!! Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Use caution,"I don't quite know how to ""rate"" this item with stars....The screen that I received was NOT the same screen pictured, Not 113"", Not able to be used with wide screen DVD's. The screen I received, even though was same product number was 50 X 50. Not even close to 113"". The screen itself was like any other screen...worked just fine, but again this item IS NOT as described. Please be very cautious. I did send mine back within hours. Amazon has promised full refund including return shipping."
4,NICE,The photo does not do the product justice. I was supprised to see it was much sturdier than it looked in the photo. It's easy to set up and the built in cary handle makes it super easy to transport. has good tension on the screen for holding it flat durring use and for easy retracting when putting it away. I'm impressed ! ! ! !
3,I didn't even think about.,I was pretty happy with the quality of the screen. It is large and flexible. The only problem I had was that I could barely fit the screen in my Linclon Continental. It does not fold into a straight package. You must work with a t-square of fairly difficult dimensions. I could not get the screen to fold even with the stand so I had to put the screen in the back seat and run the stand through the seats into the front passenger compartment. It would be difficult to transport this screen in a small vehicle.
5,Works perfectly,The screen is Great! Super fast delivery. It is a very big screen made of quality materials. This will help me teach for years.
4,For the price it works well,Easy to set up any portable. I thought it was 71 inch's wide. 71 is the diagonal measurement. (corner to corner)
3,So-so,"The screen is not bed for that money. It is big, looks good but not roll up smoothly. It was dented and it wasn't in transport, it was packed that."
5,Very good screen for the price,Very good screen for the price. Setting up is very easy & fast. I'm a happy customer.
1,Stinky screen,I opened the screen and smelled a very bad odor. It smelled like desiel oil or some other hydrocarbon. I am more sensitve than most peolpe to such hydrocarbons but it made me sick and gave me a headache. I had to open all the windows to get the odor out of the house. As a for a the other technical aspects of the screen it looked great but I am returning it.
3,Elite Screens Tripod (119-inch),"The product was delivered with 2 dents in the housing(Shipped UPS Ground). Apparently,the housing is strong enough to protect the screen inside, but I would have preferred to have received the item without any damage.There is a rod-like piece attached to the top of the screen. There are a few wrinkles where the screen is connected to the rod, but it seems minor considering that I didn't notice this while viewing videos the other night.Either the rod or the housing is slightly bowed, which is noticeable when the screen is retracted.I am satisfied with the product considering what I paid for it."
4,An economical solution,This screen is easily portable and quick to set up. Worked perfectly for my small presentation (10 people) with my Viewsonic PJD5111.
4,very good for a reasonable price,I bought this screen after using white cardboards purchased at the local office supply store for my home theatre. I wanted something affordable but good. I am very please with the price and quality. Also arrived fast from Amazon.
2,NOT PORTABLE,"This projector screen is not portable, as advertised in the description. It is very large and cumbersome. I recommend that you shop elsewhere."
5,Great Value,This item was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. It was easy to set up and use. It is a great value for the money; especially considering the free shipping and no sales tax. Thanks Amazon!
2,"Screen serves its purpose, Arrived broken twice",The screen itself meets our business presentation needs although a bit heavy and bulky to transport. Frustrated with having to return the first two screens which were damaged in shipping. Hoping the third screen arrives without incident.
2,Wrong dimensions in product description,"I purchased the item to travel with it for trade shows based on the product dimensions specified on Amazon.I have been a big fan of Amzaon and shop for personal and business purposes almost weekly, but this was the first time that product description was nowhere near the actual. The actual net dimensions was almost 60"" whereas the description says 32"". Product return was a breeze as usual."
4,Works perfectly,"Light weight and easy to use - once the controls are figured out. The perfect portable screen. But, could use directions."
5,Great Product for the price,I ordered this for a one time uses for my wedding. It was cheaper then renting one. It very easy to setup and and tar down in the middle of the ceremony. It takes up very little room in the house. No problems with it so far.
4,Really portable,"I bought two of these, and they work great. They're lightweight and portable (for those complaining, you just have to lock it into place with the pin at the top). The only problem is that one of them lost a piece on its second use that makes it slide around a bit when being transported."
4,Good Screen,"This is a very good screen for presentations. I have used mine for 4 years, and with normal care and caution, it will be a good choice for a projector screen."
4,Great Screen For <$100 bucks,"Need was for a screen that would be used 1-2 times monthly, durability, ease of transport, and good visibility. I was really quite surprised to find a screen of this apparent quality for such a reasonable price. Would be even better if carry case had been included with purchase, but not a real big deal. Have only used twice thus far, and find that unfolding tripod legs/feet so that screen stands properly with pole behind visual serface takes some practice. Hopefully will master after a couple more uses. I still believe this purchase was a good deal."
4,"very good, but will not fit in toyota corolla w/o folding back seat","Good quality, but will not fit in toyota corolla 2007 w/o folding back seat, i.e will take trunk and some back seat space. I would not recommend it for a person who needs a lightweight screen.I travel in Toyota Corolla 07 and I need to use it for PowerPoint presentations and would prefer to have screen that would fit in trunk w/o folding a back seat. This screen is too big for Corolla' trunk.I just bought it from Amazon MarketPlace and will try to replace with a smaller version.I removed one star for size and weight."
1,the cane mutiny,"abigail continues to rush in where more sensibly people would not go in the cain mutiny in her current mysterious hit and miss by luck investigations, she discovers a few bits and pices about her own family"
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Let me say first, my low rating would be because of the description posted. The deminsions are given, but not clarifying height and width. It should read ""7.2 D x 12.8 W x 16.2 inches HIGH. Unfortunately this an an inch too high to fit under my overhead kitchen cabinets. So bummed! Also, the product description does not clarify color. It is dark BROWN. Which is fine with me.Otherwise, the product is sturdy, attractive, and very useful. May just have to put it in one of our bathrooms."
4,Towel Rack,The thing i truely liked about this towel rack is that i comes just like how it looks in the photo. It a little expensive compared to some others also avaliable but its worth the few extra dollars... it can be used in the restroom as a towel rack and also in the kitchen to hold the roll of paper towels and some towels which i really liked... It came on time and looks great in my restroom now i just need a few more pretty towels to put on it
4,IMAX Iron Towel Holder,"I ordered this towel holder for a guest bathroom it looks great there, so glad I ordered it. Thank you"
5,Iron Towel Holder,"This is absolutely beautiful! Does not look any kind of cheesy at all. Very substantial, stunning."
1,hard to make stick,"I had a real heck of a time getting the backing of the adhesive so I could stick this stuff on. I thought I had gotten of the backing on a small piece last week, but when I went to use it again yesterday, I got so frustrated I gave the task to another person. We both ended up deciding the backing wasn't able to come off and I was just being sadistic giving this task to her. However on reading the product description again it does say ""self-stick tape""."
4,A unique dinosaur book,My son loves this book about dinosaurs. It gives a unique perspective on what dinosaurs could help us do if they came back now. The back page lists many different types of dinosaurs with line drawings of them and their names. This miniature sized book makes it great for travel.
2,Dinosaurs fall flat,"We picked up ""If the dinosaurs came back"" because of its beautiful and clear-cut illustrations. The visual impact is very enjoyable.However, the book falls short on its contents. ""If dinosaurs came back"" - yes, what if they did? In this book, their return would be very tame indeed. Dinosaurs could become buses, we learn, dinosaurs could be used as ladders, they could do timberwork in wooded areas, or people could own them like pets and take them for a stroll on a leash. But where is the dinosaur essence here? Where is the rampage, the nutsized brain, the carnivorous jaws, the giantic appetite? If dinosaurs came back, oh what happy mayhem it could be! But in this book the famed old lizards display about as much characteristics as a forgotten chair on a street corner.Verdict: Too infantile - even for the young set (ages 3 and up). But nice pictures."
2,Thriller Double Feature FRANTIC AND PRESUMED INNOCENT,"I am a great fan of Harrison Ford BUT...FRANTIC was a mishmash of nonsence involving drugs and unbelievable characters including Ford. Ford's character came off as pretty pathetic and the supporting roles were without merit (no wonder, the dialogue was silly). Not a keeper for me. PRESUMED INNOCENT was carried by Ford and watchable. The plot is about Ford who is investigating a murder when a series of events puts him under suspician of committing the crime himself. Worth watching once, only because of Harrison Ford. Just my opinion - others may like it. I can't remember FRANTIC being in the cinama houses at all. I am sure it was paired with PRESUMED INNOCENT on dvd to make some money. Sorry folks!"
4,Finally found Paul Stookey's version of There is Love (The W,"Finally, I cannot believe after 2 weeks searching that I finally found a CD with There is Love (The Wedding Song) sung by Noel Paul Stookey, the original artist, whose sweet, sweet voice makes this song complete. His version of this song is like no other (sorry, Petula) and it was worth holding out to find. God gave him this song, and the ability to sing it like intended at the joining of two. Thanks amazon for helping me find it."
3,An OK CD,"This CD is OK and I did like the fact thatThe Wedding Song is on it.I also was glad to finally find on amazon""A Song For My Son"" for the mother groom dance and""A Song For My Daughter"" for our father bride dance.I could get these songs as singles or onThe New Wedding Traditions Volume I CDThanks amazon.com"
1,Historically a howler,"Despite claiming extensive research, the content of this book bears little resemblance to the history of the era. He quotes out of context and ignores any evidence that doesn't support his notion that guns were not a part of everyday life in the eighteenth century. For example, Bellesiles sites the rarity of privately owned arms in Massachusetts ignoring the documented fact that, after the revolutionary war started, Massachusetts bought hundreds of arms from private citizens to arm the militia. This book is an example of revising history to suit one's one notions. Skip this one."
1,"Bias, Ignorance or Both?","I could not make it all the way through this biased, poorly written, purpose driven piece of wasted paper despite my best efforts. It is not so much an examination of guns in America as it is a perfect example of the left's dishonesty and eager willingness to leave all facts, integrity and truth behind in order to arrive at a conclusion chosen ahead of time by either political or emotional motivations. A perfect example and proof that many (most?) of the liberal left are perfectly happy to misinform, misrepresent, distort and lie about any subject necessary in order to sway the ignorant, stupid and easily led to support their positions."
1,satisfying to see debunked,"I'm not a member of the NRA, I'm not a Republican, but I do own a gun for self-protection.Anyways, it is somewhat refreshing to see that some of the academia and the mainstream media are actually criticizing a beloved leftist professor's blatantly false merde. This book and the limited expose it has received lately is a testament to that."
1,Attempted Dis-Arming Of America: A Political Fairytale,"If there were a negative 5 stars, that is how I would rate this!How this work could not be considered a work of fiction instead of a scholarly thesis is beyond me. How anyone, even the most ardent ant-gun activist, could consider this work to be anything other than a purely political piece of propaganda is amazing. How the publishers could have presented this book as non-fiction and how the media could have extolled its virtues really gives one pause. Such a blatant attempt to incorrectly rewrite American history in order to further the author's own political agenda with the full support of most of the major print journalists is a major abuse of the first amendment.Lastly, the author doesn't even tell a good story, even if it is fictional and he's used his non-artistic license to its fullest."
1,Columbia University rescinds Bancroft Prize.,That pretty much wraps up the sorry saga of this book. First time the prize has been taken away in 54-year history of the award.
1,Tainted history,"I read this book due to my interest in early American history. About half way through I started reading reports of how the author totally concocted his findings - using records that don't exist and blatantly misreporting others.So this book has lost absolutely all credibility with me. Trying to accept anything in this book as fact would be like trusting an encyclopedia that reported that WWII was fought in the 50s.Bellesiles allowed politics to get in the way of true history. If he didn't like the results of what he found, he should have shelved the project."
1,Bogus History,This author has been proven to be a fraud in all his obversations with regard to the so-called American Gun Culture. Anyone who reads this book should understand that it is a complete work of fiction. Research the author on the internet if you don't believe me...
1,Bogus!,"This book has been proven to be not just inacurate and poorly researched, but blatent fiction. Bellesiles has been hounded out of a job at Emory University for this bit of fakery."
1,"Whatever it is, it isn't history","Potential readers should know that this book is loosing credibility rapidly. A few days ago Columbia University rescinded the Bancroft Award, and asked Mr. Bellesiles to return the 4K prize money. Save your dough, unless you think the author and publisher deserve to be rewarded for passing Arming America off as history."
1,Fraud,"Michael Bellesiles resigned after a panel of scholars from places such as Harvard and Princeton concluded his failure to cite sources for material in his book, Arming America."
1,This is a work of pure fiction,"Mr. Bellesiles recent work is pure fiction at best and deliberate falsehood at worse. According to Mr Bellesiles a search of probate documents shows that very few if any guns were listed in wills. His premise then is that there were little or no guns in use by our ancestors. Thatis simply wrong. What he himself wrote in a previous work about the ""Green Mountain Boys"" belies everything he postulates in this latest work. A strict search of probate records would also ""reveal"" that our forefathers also hade very few, if any, clothes since these were not passed down by wills. By his interpretation then, our ancestors hunted for their food bare handed and bare naked. Michael A. Crognale Dallas, Texas"
1,A Loaf of Lies Justifiably Condemned by Bellesiles' Peers,"The absurdity of the intellectually weak and ineffectual claims about lack of ownership and application of firearms in colonial America has been powerfully underscored by academic peer condemnation (after intense and impartial investigation) of what is clearly lazy and grossly inaccurate so-called ""research."" The shrill and strident voices of the hoplophobes have been shown again to be based in nonsense and lies. Although editorial reviews originally touted the book for its provocative results, we see now that Bellesiles lied through his teeth, wrongly accepting the Bancroft prize from those gullible enough to bestow it. Shame on any academic for such sloth and deceit! Too bad we cannot rate ""No Stars."""
1,What a joke,"This book is a complete joke; read it sometime if you ever need a good laugh. But even funnier is the Amazon.com review by Lesley Reed, above. It is typical of how the liberal press swallowed the author's lies and distortions hook, line and sinker simply because they wanted to believe it. Now that Bellesiles has been disgraced (he was disciplined by Emory University for his chicanery), the liberals are strangely quiet. Crow, anyone?If you want to read a factual book about the ""gun wars,"" read ""SHOOTING STRAIGHT, Telling The Truth About Guns In America,"" by Wayne La Pierre and James Jay Baker. Yeah, I know, they're NRA guys, but unlike the Bellesiles book, every statement is scrupulously documented and backed up by verifiable facts. The book will open your eyes to what's going on, and the battle we face to preserve our freedom."
1,Changing the Culture?,"From the tone of the book Bellesiles has fallen in lockstep with President Clinton's idea, that to do anything about the ""gun problem"", the ""gun culture must be changed"". (Clintons own words.) Change our existing historical culture? This is scary. And the attempt might succeed. After all it takes some work to read and verify this books sources. Will ever reader do that? (It is obvious some here have not.) Reading the source material shows Bellesiles is doing some ""creative interpretation"". Why? Even reading the ""Laura Ingalls Wilder"" books leave one with no doubt that firearms were owned by most ordinary people."
1,Difficult to Reconcile with other Historical Writings,"This book is very difficult to reconcile with other historical works. After all, the relevant time period is only a few hundred years ago when, believe it or not, people were able to write! As a result, there are many, many, documents which conflict with the author's conclusions. For an enjoyable opposing view, I suggest one read Undaunted Courage by Ambrose who describes the use of firearms during the Lewis and Clark expedition. Or consider the writings of Jefferson, Hamilton, and other historical figures as another source.My overall impression is that the author's methods need to be questioned. There is too much conflicting information that we know to be accurate to declare this book a credible work. Who should we believe - Bellesiles or Thomas Jefferson and Meriwhether Lewis? My suggestion is don't bother to buy this book unless you enjoy the irritation of someone trying to prove to you the earth is square based upon esoteric records."
1,Vivid Imagination,"This ""research"" is so full of holes, Dr Besilles might have just as well used a 12-guage as a word processor to create it."
1,Excellent example of academic dishonesty.,"This book is one of the finest examples of academic dishonesty currently in existence. Good to have as a student to judge how not to write history, not something to actually be taken seriously."
1,Fraud,"What will it take for liberals to use fact? When will they avoid the Menchu version of history?The gentleman author here has been exposed as a fraud, yet we still see laudatory hosannas telling us he is a brave fellow who exposed what liberals thought was evil--yet they are the same liberals who probably praised Pol Pot, Stalin, and Daniel Ortega--and think he is a nice, progressive person. Liberals would further their cause if they removed their believing minds from serious issues, and spoke the truth."
1,This book was debunked almost the day it was published,"This author wrote this to conform to a left wing agenda and it was accepted by his peers and publisher as solid fact, when it was mostly invented. I will not list the huge amount of evidence to the contrary, as it would take too long. I will say that, like most hard core religious people, liberal anti-gunners will stick to their opinions as solid fact and will denounce those who say otherwise. So, if this is your bent, here's more fuel for your fire. And if you need SOME proof, I have a diary from the 1740's by an ancestor, who detailed shooting contests, hunting and skirmishes, from the time he was 14. At one point, he jumped in a river to escape a bear, and held onto his rifle, when the rest of his gear and even clothing had been torn away by the current."
1,Arming America:The Origins of a National Gun Culture,"In a very short time I was able to see that the research that the author conducted was flawed. I researched the Mayflower ship records and I came up with an entirely different view of our American forefathers. They depended on the gun for food, defense, and entertainment. Paintings of the day show Americans with the weapons of the day in prominant views whether they are outdoors or indoors. The militias of the Revolutionary War were instumental in keeping the British Armies out of the South and it was the guns in the hands of the civilian population that sparked the Whisky Rebellion. Muskets were used in warfare at the time, however the rifle and the shotgun were the guns over the mantel piece. Using this book as a research tool would be a waste of time and genuine scholars would do better to read the dairies of the men and woman of the era."
4,This astonishing book should be widely read,"Every now and again comes a book which keeps history honest. Like any historian, Michael Bellesisles may not have found the complete truth, and of course he won't please every reader. But anyone with a mind still open to inquiry and open debate (another Constitutional guarantee, remember) will be amazed by the evidence debunking earlier assumptions about guns in America.This is an important book, and it deserves better than kneejerk, partisan dismissals."
1,Author is very deceptive,"Bellesiles stretched the truth more than once in trying to prove his point in this book. In checking his sources, often the ones he lists, even the particular pages that he lists, contain evidence that contradicts his claims. He quotes parts of sentences from those sources and ignores the contradictory information on that same page. While he was correct that ""sport hunting"" didn't catch on until after 1840, most frontiersmen and families did utilize hunting as a means of supplying food for their table. His quotes of George Washington's complaint about SOME of the militia being poorly armed and trained when his letter complained of ""the odd behavior of the few militia"" from certain counties ignores the fact that Washington indeed found this odd! While an interesting perspective, this book is exaggerated and incorrect in many respects. I'd encourage anyone reading it to check the sources carefully before taking any statements made as truth."
1,"Cooked science, crooked facts","It's amazing that Amazon chooses to keep its earlier reivew posted, now that the author has been terminated (allowed to resign under pressure) and an independent commission has found gross ethical and professional lapses in his research. There is no one, anywhere, any longer defending this book as knowledgeable. I suggest that Amazon either pull its review as misleading or re-write it until it is no longer so."
1,This book is based on false data.....,".. and as a result, his bancroft prize was taken back. Michael Bellesiles has followed in the footsteps of the gun cotrol crowd, who will go to no ends to fake data to try and win a point. Any credibility that the anti's might have had has now gone out the window."
1,Bellesiles - a liar and a fruad!,"(1) ""NEW YORK (AP)--Severe doubts about a book on guns in the United States has led Columbia University to rescind the prestigious Bancroft Prize for history.``Arming America,'' by Michael Bellesiles, had received the award in 2001. ""(2) ""Bellesiles resigned in October as a professor at Emory University, after an independent panel of scholars strongly criticized his research. In May, the National Endowment for the Humanities withdrew its name--although not its funding--from a fellowship given to Bellesiles. (pronounced Bell-EEL). ""The book is a fraud! To gun-control advocates, any means justifies their ends. It doesn't matter if its the truth. As Joseph Gerbils, Hitlers minister of propaganda used to say: ""Tell a lie often enough and people start to believe it!"" That fits this book to a tee!"
1,History prize rescinded for controversial book about guns,"This book should be moved to the ""fiction"" category. Here's an article on 13 Dec 2002 about the Bancroft panel rescinding their award for this book (the first time in their more than 50 year history they've rescinded any award):History prize rescinded for controversial book about gunsSevere doubts about a book on guns in the United States has led Columbia University to rescind the prestigious Bancroft Prize for history.""Arming America,"" by Michael Bellesiles, had received the award in 2001.http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/ny-bc-ny--bancroftprizeresc1213dec13,0,5791557.story?coll=ny%2Dap%2Dregional%2DwireZERO stars!"
1,This book has been exposed as a [fake],"The author has been forced from his academic post in disgrace after other academics reviewed his work and found that much of his information was either demonstrably false or provably not drawn from the sources he claimed to have used. For example, the author claimed to have reviewed records in San Francisco -- records which were destroyed in 1906. When called to produce his notes, he claimed they were destroyed in a ""flood"" in his office. When other cited sources we checked by other academics, they were found to contain very different information from what the author had claimed.I recommend you search on the internet for more information about the extent of the author's deception, but it suffices to say this book is not the pivotal historical expose promised by Amazon[.com] and the author. It is somewhere between a work of wishful anti-gun fiction and outright [fake]."
1,egregious misrepresentation,"Robert A. Paul, interim dean of Emory College, announced that Mr. Bellesiles would resign effective Dec. 31 after 14 years at Emory, and said the university considers ""authoritative"" an investigative committee's report about charges of research misconduct against Mr. Bellesiles.The three-person committee - composed of scholars from Princeton University, Harvard University and the University of Chicago - found that Mr. Bellesiles' work showed ""evidence of falsification,"" ""egregious misrepresentation"" and ""exaggeration of data."" ""His scholarly integrity is seriously in question,"" the committee concluded in its 40-page report."
1,Does not deserve a single star,"If you are going to tell a lie tell a big lie. This book would have us believe that citizen militas did not win the revolutionary war. I would like to know who then were those guys at Kings Mountain in the Carolinas, who was at Lexington, who crossed the Delaware. This book shows how revisionist tripe is destroying the study of history in this country. As to the affectiveness of citizen militia in the modern age I point to the Viet Cong, the Mujahideen, and the Tamar Guerillas. They fought professional soldiers and did quite well."
1,"Disgraceful ""research"" exposed as lies","Prof. Bellesiles ""research"" did not stand up to the review of his peers. His book attempts to serve the gun-ban agenda by inventing ""evidence"", but fails miserably because the real evidence supports the opposite of his claims. OOPS! If you are anti-gun and like reading anti-2nd Amendment screed, buy this book. If you are seeking the truth, avoid it. Disgraceful!"
1,Discredited,"There's an interesting dynamic to the reviews here. The early ones are glowing, the later ones are decidedly less so. The explanation is that ""Arming America"" did not withstand the process of peer review once it had been released as some historians raised questions about discrepancies within the book relating to Bellesiles' source material. To make a long story short, Bellesiles' employer Emory University empaneled a review committee of academic professionals to review the book, they concluded that there were serious shortcomings in Bellesiles' research, Bellesiles resigned from his position at Emory and today the committee responsible for awarding the Bancroft Prize at Columbia University voted to rescind the Bancroft Prize awarded to Bellesiles in 2001. As it stands right now, ""Arming America"" and Bellesiles himself are in a state of disgrace."
1,Desperately needs the benefits of the peer review process,"I am sympathetic to the desire for a safer society and an end to 'gun violence', and passionately support Mr. Bellesiles' right to attempt to influence attitudes and beliefs he finds objectionable. I am, however, disappointed that a Professor at Emory University apparently felt he needed to misrepresent his own primary research material in order to support his thesis.There is a lot of interesting, even accurate, information in this book, but I fear it demands too much from the reader to have to separate the facts from the fiction.Let us hope Mr. Bellesiles produces a revised edition where the criticisms noted in the other reviews are sufficiently addressed. I, for one, would be very interested in an objective examination of the ""origins of a national gun culture""."
1,"revisionist ""history""","Bellesiles says in the introduction to his book, ""nor does this book seek to pull out a few quotations scattered through America's long historical record to strengthen a current political position"". I would agree with that. Bellesiles pulls out EVERY quotation that will serve his end and creates others by ommission or misdirection. I wish I was still teaching history as this book would serve as a good illustration of ""the big lie""."
1,Gross misinformation!,"Emory University, Bellesiles' (ex)home, convened an investigation and has declared this book to be fraudulent, and has forced Bellesiles to resign. A national committee is now being formed to investigate Bellesiles further. If you want valid information, this is not the book you want. The resource information was found to be fabricated, and his conclusions to be a fantasy."
1,Shoddy Scholarship,"Bellesiles's new book Arming America is best understood as an example of monumentally shoddy scholarship. Filled with errors, misquotations, and outright falsehoods, it is a wonder the book got published at all. It is clear that Bellesiles's political ideology was more important than empirical fact. Clayton Cramer, a historian and author of ""Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early Republic,"" has conducted a nearly paragraph by paragraph refutation of the book. I suggest readers interested in the gun debate in America read Bellesiles's book as well as the myriad criticisms of it."
1,Debunked and disgraced,Bellesiles work has been thoroughly debunked and he has been forced to resign in disgrace. Don't buy this book.
1,Important Background Info On This Book,"In 2001 ""Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture"" received the prestigious Bancroft Prize for American history from Columbia University.In October 2002 the author, Michael Bellesiles, resigned as a professor at Emory University, after an independent panel of scholars strongly critized his research, saying that he was ""guily of unprofessional and misleading work.""In December 2002 Columbia rescinded their award to Bellesiles; in a statement issued by the school's trustees, they said that Bellesiles' ""book had not and does not meet the standards ... established for the Bancroft Prize.""An online search will quickly and easily verify that the above information is true - something that sadly cannot be said of many of the ""facts"" contained in Bellesiles' book.Whatever your views on gun control may be, avoid ""Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture"" like the plague - it has clearly and widely been discredited as bad, bad, bad history."
1,Columbia U. withdraws award for poor & misleading research!,"Columbia University announced that the school's trustees had voted to rescind the prize because Bellesiles ""had violated basic norms of acceptable scholarly conduct."" Arming America ""had not and does not meet the standards they had established for the Bancroft Prize,"" the trustees found. Columbia also requested that Bellesiles return $4,000 in prize money.It is the first time the prize for ""distinguished works"" in American history and diplomacy has been withdrawn since it was first awarded in 1948.Can't get much worse than that."
1,Sources of reliable information on the topic,"Bellesiles and his thesis has been discredited, but for those interested in pursuing the subject in more depth, and with more reliable sources, start at http://www.constitution.org/cs_defen.htm , and see particularly the collection of books by James B. Whisker, a Professor of Political Science at West Virginia University, the Whisker Militia Treatises, at http://www.constitution.org/jw/jbwhisker.htm , which shows clearly the falsity of Bellesiles thesis and supports the high level of militia activity and firearms usage with an abundance of evidence that Bellesiles conveniently chose to ignore. Any serious study of the subject needs to begin with Whisker's work."
1,The problem when 'research' is dictated by prior assumption,"The perfect example of worst-case research: 1) Determine exactly what you want to find. 2) Look exclusively for details that support it. 3) Ignore all other evidence, no matter how great or predominant. 4) Manipulate, misrepresent, and misconstrue all evidence you find. 5) finally - simply make up ""evidence"" and state that it is old so that no one will bother to verify it.This book illustrates this perfectly - partly why Bellisles (Having a PhD, I refuse to call anyone who so blatantly abused his position and ignored all research ethics and morals a doctor) has received so many admonishments and even punishments for such a crass and unscientific bashing of something simply because there was an audience and he had a personal ax to grind.Academia at it absolute worst. No wonder Joe and Jane Public have no confidence, no regard, and no respect for academics."
1,"Buy the VHS, not the DVD!","I tried 3 times to order this DVD, and each time I get a defectuous version, and each time the defects were the same: unable to read the ending of the movie and unable to access the only featurette that interrested me (the Karen's interview)!I tried to watch it on others DVD players with exactly the same results. I also had reports from people experiencing the same problems.That's why I'm telling you: do not buy the DVD version of this movie! You might get angry.I will try to buy the VHS version. After that, I will write a review on the movie itself."
1,It could have been a lot better,"The story was classic B-flick. The execution(no pun intended) was weak. The skin element was truly lacking here. Nudity was minimal or no long enough. The only love scene was not intense or engaging at all. A bath/shower scene should be added and better acting would have made a big difference. The fighting was okay, standard fighting, nothing special. Karen McDougal (who was great as PMOY 1998) was not acting here at all in this movie and she does not bare enough skin to make up for the lack of acting skills. A tighter script, more skin, stronger love scene and better dialogue would have made this into a truly worthy flick."
2,Not my cup of tea,This film is a low budget skin flick. I will not say that it is low quality and I certainly can not say it is high quality. The actors are good looking and the script is average at best. I ordered it thinking it was a different film. It is not one I would recommend.
2,How many times?,How many times you can read that:She is not a kid but a 'big' girl.Albeit she is a 'big' girl she doesn't know how to write.Even though she is a 'big' girl she always made the same mistakes.
2,Stupid,"I like Mary Roberts Rinehart, but this is one of her worst books. It is about a 16-17 year old who wants to be like her 20 month older sister. ""Bab"" gets into too many stupid problems. I found nothing funny about this book. I kept reading it thinking it would get better. It never did."
2,Pretty slow...,"I did manage to finish reading this book, but it certainly was not memorable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,Wild & Sensual Tarot Cards - a treat and a perfect VALENTINE,"Now, I collect Tarot Decks but have never seen one like this -- a wild and wacky, fun and free-spirited reinterpretation of the cards, complete with sensual games and erotic suggestions -- but at the same time, the text really lives up to expert and timeless traditional meanings of the cards, as well. A perfect blend of old and new. Delicate and well thought out, not at all obscene. A playful and imaginative modern spin on the cards. The accompanying book really was complete and throught provoking. A treat."
