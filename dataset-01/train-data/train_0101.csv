1,Reagan administration propaganda,"The lies of the Reagan administration just keep coming in this book that attempts to justify the terror of the U.S. proxy Contra forces. For people who want a serious analysis of how the U.S. empire has brutalized Nicaragua, here are a couple resources:Washington's War on NicaraguaandSolomon's House: The Lost Children of Nicaragua."
1,nothing worse than psuedo artsyness,"Ya know, I really hate it when I see an actor I like doing stupid movies. I could care less if heather locklear does a made to video, thats her bread and butter. But Steven(Crying Game) Rea is really annoying here. He's supposed to be some hard core killer or something, but in his attempts to put on a southern (I think) American accent, he sounds more like a nerdy android. Oh yeah- they try to be arty in this drivel and use every stupid film school trick to give this tripe some kind of ""edge"" Terrible."
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this item 30 days ago, and it is already malfunctioning. The microwave turntable has stopped working, the microwave no longer gives off heat, and the toaster does not shut off automatically. I called Samsung, who advised me to return it to the place of purchase. I will not exchange it for the same unit--it's back to a separate toaster oven and microwave oven for me, even though they will take up extra room in my tiny kitchen. PS, in my case, the Samsung rep was pleasant and helpful."
3,decent Microwave but no toaster,Bought this Combo Microwave/toaster in order to eliminate multiple appliances but unforntuately it is a mediocre microwave and the toasting elements did not work well (when they worked). The toasting elements no longer heat up enough to toast and Samsung seems to have forgotten that this unit even exists under the Model MT1088SB.Hard to clean as the heating elements cover the inside walls to the point you can't really clean unles you remove the elements. Replacemen t parts are so out of line its ridiculous. 60.00 to replace the toasting rack and tray. I guess Samsung hadto make a profit quickly on this model
4,Surprisingly long-lasting appliance,"I've had this model since 2002, almost ten years now and have never had any problems with either microwave or toaster. I still use it on daily basis. Based on poor performance of my previous toasters and microwaves I expected this to die a long time ago. It is not as quick as a regular toaster but then again I've never had burnt toast with this. The inside looks still good, no chipping/peeling whatsoever and it's easy to clean. I'd given it 5 stars if the toaster elements heated up a little quicker and the unit did not take up so much counterspace depthwise."
5,A must for serious Poker players,I was advised that I should read this book at a WPT poker camp and was that right I make more sense in the way you have to look at cash games in respect to small advantages that you may not take in other games of skill but the author really know his stuff..
5,Understand your opponents (and yourself).,"The strength of this book is in helping you understand why you play the game (it may not be what you think), and more importantly, why your opponent is playing. Understanding motivations can help you understand and predict the actions of your opponent. In poker, knowledge is power, and this book will help you to win pots you may have folded, and lay down hands when you are beaten. The chapters on various playing styles are especially important. Following Dr. Schoonmaker's tips has helped me to get out of the way when beaten, and jam the pot when I had the best of it. Thanks Dr. Schoonmaker for helping make my poker play more profitable!"
1,Deceptive Title: NOT about sporting weapons,"I award one-star because this book, its title notwithstanding, is NOT about Mannlicher ""SPORTING and Military Weapons"", it only concerns Mannlicher MILITARY weapons.Of the 240 pages in this book originally published 50 years ago, exactly THREE pages concern Mannlicher sporting arms; EVERYTHING else in the book concerns Mannlicher MILITARY arms.I cannot comment otherwise about the book; I purchased the book to learn more about the Mannlicher Schoenauer sporting rifles and returned it immediately upon learning of the book's demonstrably deceptive title.P.S. Other than a handful of B&W; line drawings, the book is unillustrated."
3,What the hell is this....,"The best of both mixed in one cd or them two in a total of 10 duets, I'm confused. Someone please rate this cd and fill in the blanks !!"
4,good shoes,"nice solid shoes for rugged play. I play a lot of pick up games and playing conditions can be quite sloppy - especially during the rainy season in Northern Cali. these are excellent shoes for the price as the leather comfortably hugs your feet for good ball control. however, for game conditions on a quality pitch, I go with the mercurial vapors - feels like you're wearing latex socks with studs!"
1,A Lot Light on Detail,"I bought several books on full-timing in an RV - and this was the least helpful. While they touch on many topics, none are explored in depth - I learned nothing new from this book. In fact, I felt they kept telling me things that are simply commom sense. For example, in their section about waste water, they don't tell you how to deal w/ frozen waste lines - but they do advise you not flush disposable diapers!This book was a disappointment - and will be returned."
1,There are better resources,"90% of what's in this book can be obtained from any of the various first timer websites.If you never owned a vehicle, went camping (of any form), made or lived on a budget, had to figure out how to get health care while on vacation, cleaned out your closets or bathroom, then you may find this book of use.So much of the material in this book is very common sense stuff. Out of the 189 pages I did find six sentences that were informative. Unfortunately none of the comments went into details. I had to look elsewhere for details on the comments.I'd suggest one of the inexpensive used copies if you feel you really need this book."
1,Don't spend your money,"I would not buy this book. It may have been a very good book when written, but not today.It is dated: It has not been updated to reflect the technology that is currently available today as far as e-mail, electronic billing and payment, cell phones, mail forwarding services, and banking. The unfortunate part of this is that a significant part of the book covered this kind of information.In general, the deeper I got into the book, the more elementary it got. The advice got more like it was written for someone that did not have a clue about what to expect if they were RVing, or living in a house, or driving a car for that matter.You can get all of the information from other sources, that is probably more up to date."
3,A good place to start...,"We are going full-time this year, and I've bought several books on the subject. Sensible and down-to-earth, I found this book reassuring, but not particularly inspiring. Nevertheless, for anyone who is just starting to entertain the idea of living aboard a house on wheels, this is a good place to start."
4,Secret,"Hya Ji Won, she's still very young and still have baby fat, she's cute but I like her acting. It's heart-breaking. The main characters did their best to portrait the story."
1,I bought this for the Title song.,"Sadly, ""Christmas in the Northwest"" is the only song on this CD worth listening to. Just buy it from Itunes or Rhapsody for $.99 and save your money."
4,The spongetones show their style,"The Spongetones can be criticized as being a Beatles sound alike band. True, the concerts they've had are monuments to the Beatles music. And, true, they do play the power pop that other groups such as Badfinger and the Raspberry's played in their hey day.This Band is much more than that, however. In terms of enjoyment, they are a wonderful 60 minutes (more or less) of joy. But, rather than taking the Beatles style and aping it, they have taken the Beatles style and have molded it into something that is more of their own.Songs like ""Skinny"" and ""Rattle My Chain"" clearly fall into the Power Pop catagory that I grew up with and still enjoy. But, where do you place ""Spirit World""? This band had (has?) the potential of becoming more than a passing thing... let's hope they continue to progress and grow.If you're into power pop, and want to expand your horizons and explore the possiblities pop this CD into your player, put on your headphones and drift away..."
3,Got out of knights,"It was pretty good, but it was kind of showing out of the knight period. They wrote a lot about castles and it was titled knights. This bothered me. I really liked how it showed what a knight has as his duty."
4,Captured his interest for days! He keeps going back to it.,"My 10 year old son is fascinated with all things midevil. This book shows the armor, weopons, and lifestyle of knights. The photos are excellent and the copy is interesting. Your child may need a little help with some of the vocabulary."
1,Not the best.,"Boring, boring, boring. This book wasn't good. It had anlmost no imfo. I didn't like this book."
3,"Good, but ""Dirty Love Songs"" is better","This is an infamous 1988 compilation by GG Allin. But compared to ""Dirty Love Songs"" the songs sound unmixed and it definitely needs remastering. It features all the classics of course, of later GG. I'd suggest getting Dirty Love Songs and then going from there like I did though."
1,Most likely the worst album ever made (NO stars!),"Songs from the bottom of the Punk barrel, sloppy playing, ""lyrics"" barked by a man with no vocal talent at all, unbelievably bad sound quality and the most juvenile and lavatorial subject matter ever- all imply that this sorry album has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Anyone who suggests that the legacy of GG Allin is a gutsy example of extreme counter-culture has a far greater love of social anthropology and artless misadventure than music. You want primal musical extremity? Check out early Swans or Einsteurzende Neubauten - give this pretender a miss."
2,The shocking thing about GG Allin...,"Is how non-scary and non-frightening he really was. Ooo, he really shook society's pillars, didn't he? Allin was basically an obscure walking train-wreck who simply was a little more noisy about it. The extent of Allin's threat to society only ranged as far as his throwing arm could...Nevertheless, if you *must* own one of his records, this is a good one. Allin's various back-up bands all sound like the same bad Stooges cover band, but the song intros are hilariously stupid."
1,I've heard better,"This is truly a sad & disgusting CD, filled with vile and degrading lyrics that anyone with a four-letter vocabulary could easily write. Amazingly, a label produced it and people buy it. Don't waste a nickel on this noise."
3,Bad Scope,"Liked the gun and everything that came with it, but really got it for the scope and that DID NOT work at all."
5,GWM/ISO Michale Thomas Ford!,"Loved from cover-to-cover. Once again I was made to feel that I'm not the only one who thinks like that, does that, and has a thing for Olivia Newton-John! The further in the book I went, the more of a crush I developed on this guy. If I were to sit down now and start my own book of essays, it would be mirrored by the thoughts and experiences of this very talented humorous man. Such a quick read, laugh-out-loud, book to never lend out to others (cause they might keep it themselves! )! Thank you, can't wait to read more..."
1,"Shallow, ""looks""ist humor","I know many who enjoy this book; I found it not only shallow but downright offensive, particularly in the way its humor, about the protagonist's mother or about others, turns so often on shots at appearance."
3,What Queer Life?,"To name this book '...Other Trials of My Queer Life' seems something of an oddity itself. Only two chapters in the entire book even mention the word 'homosexual,' but then do nothing much with that information. Even the title essay about Alec Baldwin's hairy chest reveals more about obsession than anything about being gay. Still, just reading the chapter on Ford's dinner with the Von Trapp's was worth the price of the book alone! Hilarious! You can't describe the chapter; you just have to read it yourself and be prepared to laugh for the rest of the day. Ford is a master of the short form, but the longer pieces just go on and on. I await his next book. It is tough to find truly funny books that are not David Sedaris rip-offs. Ford has a voice all his own."
2,Very disappointing,"Not only did I buy this book, I also bought ""That's Mr. Faggot To You."" on the advice of these reviews. Looking for something light and entertaining, what I found were ""whoa is me"", predictable, ridiculous (why rag on poor Kim Bassinger; she got there first) stories that did not make me laugh. Fortunately, they were short. The author also is inconsistent, contradicting himself from story to story on everything from his love life to Christmas. If you haven't already done so, read the Unofficial Gay Guide by two lawyers out of DC. Now that was funny!I couldn't relate at all to Michael Thomas Ford and the very thought that he actually gets paid for this is very encouraging. If he can make money at it, so can I. I know I'm lots funnier! Back to the real literature for me..."
4,Satire at it's most satirical,I've seen the movie and decided to read the book. The book is a tad more satirical and a tad less funny. Somehow it seems like it is making more fun of the characters and they are less likeable. Everything is tied up in a nice bow at the end except we never learn what was nasty in the woodshed.
2,Abridged Version,"While I imagine that this book, in it's complete form, is very enjoyable & I love Ms. Gibbon's works, I was left disappointed as I learned that this publication is not the complete text (a fact which I checked with the publishing house). If you are looking for a quick read, this is your best bet. However, you will find the ending somewhat abrupt and many of the characters and plot lines underdeveloped at best."
5,Cold Comfort Classic,"I am a big fan of the movie, but I'd never read the book until recently. It left me laughing out loud at the eccentric characters, the wry wit, and the send-up of certain novels, which the author managed to do without being mean or petty about it. I loved this book."
4,nice story,"The weak point of this story is it's not quite clear. At the end,we don't know ""what's the something nasty in the woodshed"". However,I strongly recommend this story for everyone who is down and frustrate."
2,Silly,"I found this book was written like a comedy but because it only made me laugh once it was just silly. Comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it, and love it or you don't. I didn't. I found the dialect frustrating: It was supposed to be set in Kent but the dialect read more like northern England, you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you're not even aware that humour is present. At least that's what it was like for me. Whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn't explained in the end but you're left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn't really suit the book, being or trying to be a comedy, hence the lack of explanation. I've given it two stars because when Gibbons takes a step back and looks at the overall picture she has a great way of describing scenes."
4,House of Doom and Mirth,"This book is a very funny parody of the Gothic pretensions of D.H. Lawrence-style rural melodramas. In this Gibbons is continuing the Jane Austen tradition of comparing reason and emotion and contrasting her works with Gothic novels. The characters at Cold Comfort Farm are hilariously stereotyped ones from Lawrence and others. Gibbons is very good at puncturing the insufferable misogyny of male intellectuals of the period (Mr. Mybug being the main example) and showing how it covers a craving for some kind of connection.Although there are parallels with Austen, in Austen's books the heroine would have a moment where she realizes that she has also been wrong. That moment never comes with Flora, who is always right and reasonable all the time. She is thus almost a symbol rather than a character that develops over the novel. Still, it is a very funny novel from a woman's point of view. Definitely worth reading."
3,Enjoyable - but not the original text,"I read the book as part of a book club. We all found it amusing and entertaining. Be warned - this is not the same text as originally published. I ordered this edition because it would ship sooner than others which appeared higher on the sort list. While the story arc is the same, and the characters as quirky, it became apparent that my version misses a lot of the descriptive prose my friend all read. Skip this edition and get the full deal."
1,"ABRIDGED EDITION, BE WARNED","This is probably a very lovely book, but BE WARNED: The copy on this page is the abridged edition, not Stella Gibbons's original text! There is no need to read an abridged version of this English classic. The publisher should make more clear that this is not the real text."
3,Cold Comfort Farm,"Read this book for our bookclub but was not able to participate in the discussion. I felt it was interesting but took me awhile to get through it. I didn't feel the heroine was realistic, even for that time period."
5,Spectacular Writing,"Every once in a while you come across a book that is so well done you just have to marvel at the spectacular writing. Cold Comfort Farm was that type of book for me. Oh what I wouldn't give to sit down for an hour with Stella Gibbons - or listen to a long lecture given by her.The humor is so unique: A fight over a lost cow leg, Seth lounging and undoing buttons, Agony and the jazz band, and ""My liddle mop"". Oh my. I'm still chuckling.I read this one in paperback form and wished I'd purchased it with my Kindle. I love using the dictionary function of that device to be sure not to miss anything presented by the author. There's no doubt I will reread this title and next time, buy it in ebook format.A unique, fantastic classic. Perfect in so many ways."
5,Outstanding Wit,"Cold Comfort Farm is a superbly written parody of the typical 1900's novel of English country life. Flora after being educated and raised in comfortable affluence finds upon the death of her father she is pennyless. After much deliberation and advice to the contrary from her friends she decides to become a parasite on her relatives. Her relatives the Stackadders are a strange collection living on Cold Comfort Farm deep in rural england ruled by an old woman who once saw ""something nasty in the woodshed."" Flora intrudes and moves the stackadders lives firmly into the 1900's. A brilliant satire that is so rich in description and humor that you appreciate more each time you read it."
5,Wuthering Heights meets Oscar Wilde,"Wonderfully witty. Imagine if Wuthering Heights were written by Oscar Wilde, and you have Cold Comfort Farm."
5,Extremely funny,"Cold Comfort Farm is a really comforting novel that kept me laughing from start to finish. The names of most of the characters are hilarious and their problems equally so.""spoiler alert"" Aunt Ada Doom saw something nasty in the woodshed and uses this as an excuse to control the rest of her family. Flora Poste, her niece descends upon the gloomy farm they inhabit and sets about to liberate her cousins from the iron grip of Ada Doom. There's depressed Judith Starkadder, her self-righteous husband Amos, their sons- lustful Seth and anxious Ruben, wild Elfine, senile Adam, perverted Urk, unmarried Rennet and a host of other interesting characters.Read it and enjoy not just the humour, but the satire and the psychological exploration of human longing that makes this novel unputdownable. I enjoyed it more than the film."
5,delighful vacation reading! a book of great good cheer,"The heroine of this book, Flora Poste, notes that she has enjoyed many Victorian novels because, ""they were the only kind of novel you could read while you were eating an apple."" That's how I felt about this one. Plenty of irony and humor to overshadow the sentimentality."
3,1st time the movie was better,"I am first and foremost a book person. I rarely see a movie that was a book without having read the book. And 99% of the time I prefer the book. However this is one time when the movie tidied up a lot of the loose ends that were in a book. It is worth a read but this is not a classic I would rush to give a re-read ; I was expecting to be much more enthralled given the lauditory introduction. There are some exquisite moments and some fabulously understated humor but all too often I found myself wishing that sections had been omitted. I have also read a ""re-telling"" of the book but that was much worse."
4,Cold Comfort Famr,"This writing tells of Flora Poste, knowledgeable young woman from London who goes to live with some strange relations in Sussex that she had never seen before, the Starkadders of Cold Comfort Farm. She knows their people who live on farms in Sussex are bound to be deeply unhappy, Amos about religion, Judith about her son Seth, Reube about his muddy fields, Elfine about her poetry and Aunt Ada Doom with something can never forget that she saw something nasty in the woodshed when she was two. The Starkadders are a mad, violent lot, very rustic in that farm, and Flora would like to tidy up their very untidy lives. The writing tells how she finally succeeds in doing, against all the odds and with many funny incidents. Stella attributed much of the success of Cold Comfort Farm to coming at exactly the right time."
1,Abriged Edition,"Pay attention that this book is an abridged edition. When we got to our book discussion group this evening, we found that we had completely wasted our time reading it because we didn't have the Foreword and Introduction, therefore we didn't realize it was satire and a parody. I cannot understand why the publisher would publish an abridged edition of this book."
4,Cold Comfort From The 1930s,"In 1932 Stella Gibbons published Cold Comfort Farm, a comic novel describing the adventures of a modern young woman plumped down on some distant relations' Sussex farm. In the 1930s novels idealizing rural life were very much in vogue, and Gibbons wished to satirize them. She was highly successful and Cold Comfort Farm remains in print 80 years later, still cherished for its witty language, bizarre situations, and surprising plot twists. Inevitably the writing seems a bit antiquated here and there, and deciphering the Sussex natives' dialect must have been a challenge even back in 1932, butCold Comfort Farm is still well worth the effort."
2,Dumbed-down for Americans,"I ordered this edition of my favorite book on my Blackberry, so didn't bother to read the fine print that explained that it had been re-worked for American audiences. Considering how popular Jane Austen is in the US at the moment, I fail to see why the Sussex dialog and other British-isms need to be changed. I know the book so well that I thumbed through this edition and found that it wasn't only the Sussex language that was changed- EVERYTHING is watered-down, so the piquancy and charm is totally missing. I am grateful that the bookseller was very accommodating when I requested to return it for a refund. Back to the British publications for my fix!"
1,Do not buy this edition,"As many have stated, this is an abridged version and lacks a great deal of the novel's descriptive prose. It also alters some words to make it easier to understand. This version might be useful if you'd like to cut corners in one of your classes, but if not, go with the Penguin Classics version."
4,A laugh-out-loud funny novel,"I really enjoyed this book, it is written with such extraordinary wit and humour, it cracked me up on every page!Though I couldn't relate to the Hardy and DH Lawrence insinuations since I haven't read anything by them yet, I still found the novel utterly charming with its obvious parody and ""making fun of everything""-way. Stella Gibbons' style was fantastic, it was a hugely enjoyable novel."
4,"It is a book that I recommended,Cold Comfort Farm.","Cold Comfort Farm is a comic novel by Stella Gibbons. Original edition is published in 1932. Cold Comfort Farm is now regarded as a classic of parody. It parodies the romanticize,doom-laden accounts of rural life in some novels. I enjoy reading it because it is very fascinating,interesting and attractive. The charm of this novel is the contrast between the extremely rationality of Flora and the autocratic rules of Aunt Ada Doom in Starkadders family. The dialect is mavellous and the description passages show a brilliant grasp. The scene is suitable and every performers are appropriate. I think it also suit for everyone who love a comic novel. Furthermore, it makes me acquire the idea which is the great determination that brings all of accomplishments. Finally, I think it is a novel that the readers do not miss to read it."
3,good shipping,"the product is what i ordered, came in time for christmas and wrapped the way i liked! :) now my only problem is my ipod classic quit working..."
3,"Nice Case, doesn't quite work out in the long run","This is a nice iPod case and I still use it. However, the stand function of the case isn't all it's cracked up to be. This is mostly due to the fact that it is a leather and fabric case and not a hard shell.It's still a good case, but not for the stand."
2,Danger - the belt clip connection is fragile,"The first day the belt clip broke loose, and my 80GB ipod fell to the concrete pavement. On the plus side, the leather case protected the ipod on impact.Its an attractive and useful case without the clip, so I continue to use it."
4,Well thought out!,"This product has been very helpful to me. I use my iPod for music, videos & audiobooks so I'm constantly accessing it. If I was to suggest any changes, it might be to abandon the Velcro in favor of magnetic closures. Other than that, this case is excellent!"
4,"Great product, but awkward clip","This was just the case I needed -- the leather flap and plastic screen cover protect my 80GB iPod, and the kickstand makes it easy to watch videos. The belt clip works fine; my only complaint is that there is no access to the click wheel unless you let the leather kickstand flap hang down from the belt clip. This looks strange and can be otherwise annoying, but nevertheless the product works great and does what I need it to do."
4,Dig it,"Works well and is very stylish. The only downfall which isn't all that noticeable when watching a vid (as I believe someone mentioned) is that the soft plastic screen cover scratches fairly easy if you're not careful with it. Otherwise, great cover, mine is an 80gb video."
5,A true triumph!,"This Bjork CD is quite the triumph. I really like it and I appreciate the icelandic language, so it was really no obstacle for me to get used to this.One thing first- this isn't so much a 'jazz' album persay, but then again, there is a lot of jazz bass present. I would call it more icelandic folk jazz since a lot of it has some pretty folk, non-modernized sounds.Overall, I'm a big fan of Bjork, and anywhere where she can just show off her raw vocal talent I think is a triumph for her when she isn't droned out by loud electronic beats, as much as I appreciate them. That's why I enjoy Next to Last Song from Dancer in the Dark because there is no music in the background.I think that this is one of the most interesting albums that's out on the market, and I think its wonderful that Bjork made an album that shows her roots and a new side of her. I love it when she tries something new because its always interesting.[....]It's a great album..."
5,Great for Bjork Fans of All Ages including Babies,"I'm a huge Bjork fan and didn't even realize this existed until I saw it on Amazon. It's jazzy and a lot fun. If you don't speak Icelanic, look for the english translation on the net as the lyrics are great as well...I was listening to this with my 1 month old who really seemed to respond well to it although that could be my imagination. The title track, Gling-Glo, could be on any World Music Soundtrack for children."
3,It has a good beat and you can dance to it.,"""In the Mood"" is a great great song. Its one of those that sneaks up on you and raps you right upside the head, like ""take that, stupid"", and you know it feels good... I need a good one every now and then I think we all do. One that just jumps right out and says ""take this joy that I feel and and feel it too"""
1,"If you like his 1987 self-titled release, don't buy this",His most recent work is on an self-titled album called Tiny Town. He shares lead vocals with the former lead singer from the Subdudes. If you miss Pat's music in your life...this recording will do your soul good.
3,"Something wrong,but still good.","There is no tense atmosphere. But the music relaxed me. This is't so good album compare with his others. But you know,this is still good."
1,POOR SHREDDER,I just got this shredder becuase it was recommended by the one review available. The machine did not work for more than two minutes before it broke. What it did shred was done poorly. If you need a heavy duty shredder I would look somewhere else. Mine is going back.
5,"Fresh, original","Fresh and original sound from a midwestern group. Several tracks left me humming, and others made me think. My favorites were ""my mistake"" about the despair experienced after seeing the pain of infidelity, and ""drift away"" which is a lonely song about a developing relationship rift. The harmony of these three new performers is tight, and production quality is good."
4,Real Phat,"Real phat scent. Not as fly as I remember it being like 5 years ago when I first came across a sample tiny bottle of it....but almost as phat as I remember. Very unique, I gotta stay flyyyyyyyyyy."
2,Cleverness and little else...,"I like Tim Powers' books. I don't like this one too much though. Powers love of the grotesque is in full force here, but what you've really got here is two stories that don't need each other. Post holocaust LA and the mysterious evil thing don't need to be in the same story, and one basically distracts from the other. Also, what's Powers' deal with mutilation? Why ask here? Might as well here as anywhere."
2,Carter crashes and burns in this one,"When I saw that Carter released a new CD, I was quite excited and quickly snatched it up. Unfortuantely, Carter spends the entire album flaunting his skills by constantly screeching his horn, popping the reed, and all other assortments that, by themselves, give a solo an added touch, but when together as a complete solo, just make it disgusting.Though I still really enjoy James Carter as a musician, I feel like he could have done much better. Carter really disapointed me here. Instead of spending the album showing off to his audience, he needed to just concentrate on making music."
3,"A great collection of recipes, although trapped in a limited software","I bought this CD online over a year ago and is the best collection of Weight Watcher recipes all in one place. It's the WW SlimWays collections(Mexican, Italian, Grilling), the NEW Complete Cookbook..10 in all.Regrettably, this CD is no longer supported by the orginal publisher and tech support has ceased. The ingredient database is limited and I haven't been able to update some of the ingredients. The email function no longer works as the software was written for Windows 95. It will work in XP on some computers, but I would consider it solely a virtual WW recipe collection(pre-POINTS era-no POINTS on the recipes) with limited software features.With the resurgence of the Weight Watchers brand, this CD has resurfaced and contains many good recipes.It would be nice if another software company could license with WW and update this software with some XP functioning and add the POINTS to recipes."
1,A major waste of money!,"I wish I had know how horrible this book was before I bought it! A major waste of money! Out of all the examples of ""good"" photography there was maybe one actually ""good"" photograph in the whole book. The information is just plane NOT informative. Spend your money on The Best of Wedding Photography: Techniques and Images from the Pros by Bill Hurter"
5,These are perfect,"I use these for securing cables behind the computer, entertainment center, as well as looping unused cables and securing them with these. these are the thinner ones but work great. what else can i say....???? it's velcro."
2,Made for kids who know long words....,"I watched this with my little sister, and neither of us were impressed. It didn't tell us much of anything, acting like it was really cool. It seemed like it was made for kids (ones, my sister points out, who know some long words), and the quality almost indicated it was made BY kids. The commentator is a young girl who's not much of an actress, and sounds too excited for things not that exciting.Eyewitness videos are much more entertaining and informative."
3,Not the Best from Otis,"I have been a big fan of Otis Spann for years and have enjoyed his solo work and with Muddy. This album however has never struck a cord with me. I think its the fact there is too much organ playing and not enough piano. Overall sound quality is poor and due to the chessy organ it sounds a bit dated. On a positive note, the band is tight with Luther 'Guitar' Johnson on guitar and his wife, Lucille, shows up on a couple of tracks belting out the blues. Overall this album kind of blows. Check out 'Biggest Thing Since Colossus' for an excellent Otis Spann solo album or Father and Sons to explore his work with Muddy."
5,Intriguing Ideas,"I've purchased several books by this author and so far Visual Music is the best. If you like math and geometry, you'll probably find this book offers an interesting viewpoint. The author relates basic numbers to their meaning in ancient Egyptian culture and mythology. Some of the ideas seem radical but do make sense. The author claims that the 3-4-5 triangle originated in Egypt, not in Greece with Pythagoras. Egyptian mythology is argued to be the source for the 'trinities' in Christianity. This book makes you rethink everything you've been taught in and about Western culture."
4,Impressions of a B Player,This book was recommended to me by a player who had improved rapidly by reading it. It deals with specific elements of attacks and helps to build familiarity with the patterns that lead to those attacks. My only concern is that the openings emphasized are not the fianchetto openings I play. The patterns covered will apply more often to players who do not play fianchetto openings (though fianchettos are not ignored).
5,The Best Manual of Attacking Chess Hands Down!,"If you want to be a serious chess player, you have to master the art of chess tactics especially chess tactics that support a successful attack of the king in either the uncastled or castled positions.STOP LOOKING NOW! You've found the right book! Buy it, read it, understand it and watch your winning percentage soar into the stratosphere!"
2,TOO MUCH HYPE,"From the reviews I have read , I thought this book would improve my play . Note this is my interest -- I want to win games . I could care less if my attacking technique improves if I end up losing the game . I hope anyone reading this agrees with me . This is exactly the fault of this book . It teaches you ONLY attacking techniques that if not properly undertaken may cost you the game . Reading this book actually made my play loose . I had to look for desperate ways to get at opponent's king as my own position had too many holes . Needless to say I was under lot of pressure in my games due to aggressive attacking play . My verdict -- this book could decrease your rating in chess . Please take the reviews you read with a grain of salt . One man's meat is another man's poison ."
5,Great!,"This book is a masterpiece. Redone in algebraic notation, everything from the font and the diagrams are supberb in this fine edition. Besides the Typeset and Format of publishing. This book provides the reader with a lot of insight on attacking the vile king. The books introduces focal points ( very usefull), ways of weakining the king, the bishop sac, open diagonals, and much more BUY THIS BOOOOOOOOOOOOOKKKKKK"
4,Best Display Quality,"I have a setup where I use two laptops and a desktop, so I thought it would be nice to share a monitor/keyboard/mouse so I started shopping for a good KVM switch. I even tried a generic docking station as part of the configuration, docking station was junk but the IOGear KVM is a decent replacement of the docking station.For the KVM, I actually tried one from Best Buy and if was decent but the response from the mouse was a little slow and it got annoying. Then I tried a Tripplite that I bought online. The mouse response was good but the display quality was horrible. By horrible I mean everything was blury like I forgot to put my glasses on. It would be fine for a server but not good for a constant use pc.The IOGear is great the display is as good as if it wasn't through the KVM and the mouse response is good. The OSD (On-Screen Display) is a nice addition too, but not really something that I will use too much."
3,Really nice album! Nice sound!,"It's very Ney Matogrosso, a brazilian singer with a great background, of songs and interpretation. Every track is carefully worked, taking out the maximum power of sound and expression. At the sametime you can trip around differents brazilians rythms, Baiao, Samba, pop. The participation of Pedro is a very important point in this album. He sings in some tracks but not in all, and in none of the tracks he is in solo. Every song is a result of a research and we feel it pleases the singer. I love the track called O Mundo, from the brazilian band called Karnak. Very good album. But I don't reccomend if it's the first you are listening Ney Matogrosso. In this case buy one of the others albums, like a Best of. If you know his work, and know the brazilian music go on. You'll be pleased."
4,Very good washboard,"This works very well for smaller items but is not quite big enough for larger ones. I use it a lot though and it seems to work good for socks, and t-shirts. It is nice having the delicate side that isn't as abrasive."
5,Perfect For My Needs,"I'm so happy to finally have found the size washboard I needed. I wanted a rather small washboard that would fit in my bathroom sink. I live in an apartment and in order to do a wash one must lug their basket of dirty clothes to the laundry room, plus pay $1.15 to wash. But now with my new washboard I can do laundry less often because I can do many items in my lavatory, getting them scrubbed clean using my washboard. It is ideal for ladies nylons, anklets, types of underclothing, ring-around-the-collar and overall washing of (ladies sized) camp shirts, and other smaller clothing/items. For towels, washcloths, sheets, large items, they go in the laundry room washers. This washboard is well made, and one side is for scrubbing substanially sturdier cloth items; the other side for more delicate items. It works so well. I Have NO regrets about purchasing it."
3,Smaller than I thought,This board was alot smaller than I thought. Once I figured out how to hook it to my washtub so it won't slide around (I added a hook to the back and hook it on the lip on the tub) it works fine.
5,Lifelong friend,"So here I am once more...These haunting lyrics are the start of an amazing lyrical and musical journey which any Prog Rock fan should embark on. In the 26 years since I first heard to his amazing album, I still love to listen to it."
4,Marillion - Script For a Jester's Tear (Bonus CD),The disc is quality but not the best in my opinion. This remastered version with bonus disc and ennobles the work and worth having for those who like progressive rock. The phase of Marillion with Fish is undoubtedly of great value to the rock. Excellent!
1,Poorly written and not very comprehensive - stay away from this one,"Richard Klosterman's Community Analysis and Planning Techniques is a poor example of how Professional Planners conduct analysis. Besides being overly wordy and perhaps never to the point, this book depicts quanitative analysis backwards. The combination of Statistical methods, Data processing, Urban economics gets lost in translation and is dated. Stay away from this book unless you are a helpless victim to being taught by Prof. Klosterman - I would imagine this is required material for his classes; and if that is the reason why you need to purchase this book, I feel sorry for you."
4,Great Resource For Projecting Population And Economy,"This is a one-stop-shop how-to for projecting population and employment figures, as well as developing location quotients. This is a great resource for city planners and those interested in detailed location analysis. It explains how population and employment projections are made as well as what methods are appropriate and when they should be used, so as not to misrepresent data. Though some of the text itself may be a bit technical from time to time, the mathematics are sound and chart examples are very easy to understand. The population projections, cohort population projections, and employment projection techniques were very easy recreate on spreadsheets with own data. This is a useful reference for any planning office."
5,Good Review for AP Bio,"This is a good resource for reviewing for the test--loads of multiple choice questions and free-response questions, with answers explained."
4,Amazing Book,"I bought this book around February, giving me 4 months to prepare for the AP test. I took these tests and, boy, were they tough. They really tested that you know the material, and know it well. Having taken the AP test I must report that the actual test was MUCH easier than these tests, but that's a good thing (in my opinion), makes the real test look like a piece of cake.My only complaint is that I found a couple of mistakes in the essay questions. But other than that, a really good book."
4,"Great performance, easy to set up and use.",What's Hot:Cute design with great performance. Speedy! Easy to set up and use. No software installation needed for Windows 2000 and Windows XP system.What's Not:Draw power from external AC adapter instead of USB port directly. Bulkier then other card reader. Read CF cards only.
5,Jon Wiederhorn??,"I think Jon was not in a right state of mind or something when he chipped in his review of this album. More than likely he decided to give U.D.O.'s ""Solid"" album a listen and think twice about whether or not the Tank's age is in question. And a comparison to ZZ Top??? I'm really stumped on that one. He might as well compare Slayer to Shania Twain. It was a real treat to hear Peter sing again. The duet with Udo on Crossroads is a fan's dream come true. Hard Attack and Take Out The Crime make any ZZ Top song sound like a nursery rhyme."
1,Horrible!,"I had to read this for a school report but it bored me so much I didn't.I simply gathered information off the back,the first page of every chapter,and reviews from this web site.*Yawn*"
4,"Not quite there, but good....","As electronic music progresses I get more strict on the weird offshoots within the genera as it continues to grow, STS9 is trying hard and is talented, but seems to have a chip on their shoulder.....I still like it, but not great either....."
1,inside baseball,"if all you want is a lot of boring inside baseball about the new york times, then by all means read this book. if you want a serious look at the state of journalism today, try something by someone else."
1,Read something else,"Boring and very thin. Blair's book is a better read and magazine articles, including Mnookin's in Newsweek are more informative."
4,a nervy thriller set in a newsroom,"I'd followed the Jayson Blair saga and Howell Raines's resignation pretty closely, and I didn't think I needed to know any more about the scandals at The Times. But still I picked up Hard News, and I surprised myself by finishing it in two sittings. Mnookin has an easy, effortless style, and he tells a fast-paced tale we haven't heard before -- what happened inside The Times as it was chasing one of the most important news stories in its history. Hard News is really a detective story with a cast of characters -- Times reporters -- who make you feel that the paper as an institution will long survive. My only quibble is with the subtitle -- this book doesn't tell us what the scandals' meaning is for American media. And it doesn't need to. It stands on its own as a smart, well-researched and above all entertaining story about an exceptional American institution."
5,"Compulsively readable, memorable characters","""Hard News"" is an unstoppable account of an editor's abuse of power and a reporter's abuse of trust. People may say that a book was ""hard to put down."" In the case of ""Hard News,"" I picked it up, read for a few hours, went to bed, and then actually woke up at 4 a.m. thinking about the book and had to read it to the end. That has never happened to me before. Mnookin's feats of reporting, fast-paced style, and gripping and insightful yarn are impressive, but not what makes the book stand out. Rather, what kept me turning the pages was the way the characters of Jayson Blair and Howell Raines emerged, developed and then seemed to coalesce into two sides of the same coin of egomaniacal dysfunction. Subtle, devastating, and incredibly fun to read."
3,A tale of what went wrong at the Gray Lady,Hard News is a peek into the New York Times at a moment that was one of its lowest points in the paper's history and explains how the Times got there. We've all heard of Jayson Blair but Hard News shows that he was a timebomb from the very begining not only becuase of his own problems but because of the vile atmosphere at the NYT.Most of the book centers on Howell Raines and it slowly but thoroughly explains what Mnookin thinks went wrong. Raines may have been right--the NYT had been resting on its laurels but the way he went about shaking up the old Gray Lady turned the staff against him and by the time Jayson Blair imploded blood was in the water.This isn't a thrilling book and it's occasionally long winded but when the author finally gets to the point it's worth the wait.
2,Not much there,"This book didn't do much for me. I'm a journalism student, so typically ""insider stories"" about the news media fascinate me. But this one just laid out everything I had already learned about the Blair incident in my journalism classes. And the one real interesting character in this drama - Howell Raines - wasn't even interviewed for the book. The writing, at least was decent, but overall it was kind of a waste of time. There are many, many far superior books out there about the New York Times, I suggest readers try one of those."
1,Yawn,"I had hoped this book would provide some real insight into the culture at the New York Times that gave rise to the scandals of the past few years. But instead its a rehash of events that have already been covered to death in magazine and newspaper articles, and, yes, several other books. While Mnookin's writing is certainly snarky and gossipy, as seems required these days for ""media"" books, in the end its tiring and, ultimately, just plain boring."
4,Sexy!,"This was the book that made me buy 4 other Thea Devine books. This is not a book for the timid, and those who are offended by graphic sex scenes & harsh language should stay away. The alpha male here, Lujan, is imperfect, rugged, and often callous to the heroine's feelings. I would probably take out the ""romance"" part from describing this book, but it is definitely hot & sexy erotica. I highly enjoyed it!"
5,Great!,It is a fantastic book to read especially on the kindle! I was referenced it from a friend and it was well worth the short time it took to read!
3,Strange but pleasing,"I love Dumas. I had never heard of The Black Tulip. It is a big departure from his standard fare. It is also very short. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that loves Dumas' swashbuckling heros. It is totally different. However, if you can get pass the fact that it is a Dumas book and contains no sword fights, then it is a sweet book."
4,A charming fairy tale,"The translator of the Penguin edition, Robin Buss, died only three years after the edition was published. His translation is very readable, and the introduction and notes are helpful. The story itself, although there are no supernatural elements, is essentially a fairy tale, complete with a happy ending. Dumas has an informal, naive style that would never pass muster if used in a novel today, but which I suppose was standard fare in those days. I found it all very charming."
3,Too Short,"I was disappointed in this book. Oh its an okay read, but its also very short. Not what I was expecting, especially for the price. As to the book itself, all in all I still liked it. It's a bit boring in places and the adventure is almost null. I love Dumas though, and I am a huge fan of the Count of Monte Cristo. It is my favorite book by him. As an FYI, the followup stories to the Count of Monte Cristo written by the ""Holy Ghost Writer"" are also good reads. Even better, they appear to be written in the same general style as Dumas' original. I have read both ""The Sultan of Monte Cristo"" (Book II) and ""That Girl Started Her Own Country"" (Book III). As for the price, I thought it was a good value for the Kindle Editions. If you are looking for the books you can find them: http://www.amazon.com/The-Sultan-Mont...... and at http://www.amazon.com/STARTED-COUNTRY......"
4,An Exciting and Romantic Tale,"In ""The Black Tulip"", Alexandre Dumas proves again his ability to mix adventure and romance to create an exciting and romantic tale. Although Dumas may have distorted history significantly in this story, the image of late 17th century Holland which he presents is accurate and vivid enough to give the reader a lasting impression of society and culture in this period.The execution of Jann and Cornelius De Witte and the romance between Van Baerle and Rosa are portrayed with such detail that readers are not likely to forget this book. I strongly recommend this tale to any who love adventure, history and romance."
3,tough trip through paradise,A little hard to read but worth the time. A good look at the west as it realy was.
5,"A story of culture conflict, love, and resolution.","Andrew Garcia was blessed with an open mind and a keen memory. He was fortunate to have lived in a time and place on the cusp of cultural interface, european/native american, native tribe to tribe, and spanish/native american. He obeserved it all from within and without and recorded it in a memoir filled with love and humor. The people he met in that time and place speak in their own voices, still strong and true after more than 100 years. Above all else it is a memorial to his Nez Perce wife In-who-lise, a suvivor who saved him more than once. We are priviledged to be taken along the trails of the mountains with them both."
4,"Good quick service. Simply put, no problems.","I purchased a copy of ""Tough Trip Through Paradise."" Simply stated - it was delivered on time with no problems in shipping or the quality of the book."
5,great bang for the buck,"I was afraid the grabber would not be strong enough to fish out slick or heavy objects. Far from it, this handy little tool is easy to use, flexible, and opens up about 1/2 inch to place a firm grip on whatever you're grabbing. Can't ask for better price/value. Only small con is that it could be a little longer."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this as a gift for a friend and when it arrived I thought I'd try it out. First of all it's not really what I expected, in the picture it looks like it has a flexible arm, it doesn't. It's a giant spring wrapped in a thick wax, so it's very flimsy and hard to actually pick up an object. The claw is very small as well. I wouldn't really recommend this product to anyone looking for a decent pick up tool, I would go for one that is bigger and easier to handle."
4,As described,"Inexpensive, but works well, and is as described, but feels a little cheap. Good value overall tho. I would buy it again."
5,Sturdy - Great Price - Not for Weak Hands,"I rarely have a need for this type of tool but it will come in very handy once in a while like when my kid drops a bottle cap in the garbage disposer.Pros: Sturdy. Mostly metal. 23 inches long with the claw out. Dirt cheap price.Cons: The spring on mine is very stiff. It hurts my (59 year old 6' male) hand to hold the claw open for more than say 10 seconds in the open position. A person with weak hands might not be able to use it. It might not hurt as much with gloves on. On the bright side, you might only need to open the claw for a few seconds for most uses."
3,Junkies will get fixed,"3 1/2Two tracks of extended live jams does little more than stuff listeners with prime cut 'Trane soloing, which is recorded deliciously here, and if you are exploring reviews for albums like these than that is probably all you can be asking for."
2,"That's ""Bye Bye Blackbird?""","I think that""Bye Bye Blackbird,"" to me, just sounds like a couple of people, all playing different music, put together to make a song. I think it sounds awful, to say the least, but that's just my opinion."
4,"judson spence, talented writer","I reviewed your songs on the cd by the request of your cousin Bruce Lachaussee, Please email me for information to contact him. I enjoyed the song, your very talented. God bless your life and your career."
1,Sweet smell of Chistmas,The whole reason I bought it for my granddaughter was so she could scratch and sniff-there was no smell. Very disappointed.
5,my kids loved this when they were young,We have enjoyed this book EVERY Christmas for over 20 years! Our scratch and sniff stickers are pretty worn out - that's why we bought a new one (a couple for grandkids too!) Highly recommend!
4,"A wonderful book, but scents aren't strong","Like others have stated, I was so thrilled to see this book from my childhood, but disappointed that the scents are weak to non-existent. It's a very cute book, though, and my preschooler loves it as much as I did. Perhaps we're all remembering it idealistically and the original was the same quality."
4,Nice Book For Christmas,"I had never heard of this book before,but based on the reviews on Amazon I bought this for my 26 month old granddaughter.She likes to rub and sniff the ""smell circles.""She seems to like the scents except for the pine.She says YUCK for that one.I think the scents are good except the gingerbread could have been a little spicier smelling and the scent areas a bit bigger."
5,I Spy an Eye for Good Books,"Well, I saved just about all the Christmas books I had as a child so that I can read them to my kids. Every year my daughter chooses The Sweet Smell of Cristmas as her favorite. The bind is torn, probably from opening it so much and all the scratch and sniff stickers are gone, but, I can still smell the pine tree and the orange. Maybe because its been in my head all of these years. She now reads it to me and as she goes on each adventure with little bear, her face lights up. I only wish she can smell the pages like I did. What a wonderful book!!"
2,The scents last 1 month,The book alone is fine... the scents literally lasted for ONE month.. every single last sticker has absolutely no smell anymore. I feel bad when my 18 month old is sitting there scratching the stickers and trying to smell them. I would not recommend buying this book.
5,Sweet smell of Christmas,"I loved this book as a child and I know my children would love it too. I have often looked for it and cannot find it. Please consider re-publishing it! I think parents and schools, today,would love it too."
5,Fun Christmas Book,This is a fun story with scratch and sniff scents of Christmas that I had as a child and my children had and I just bought for my Grandson. He loves it.
4,Five Senses,"This book is a charming story about a bear who smells Christmas coming. I am impressed that the author came up with so many smells to include. Both my girls (ages 18 mos and 3) enjoy listening to this book and sniffing the scents. Not only does the book include a variety of smells, but it incorporates the smells in the scenes of Christmas and the sounds of Christmas. It seems to enhance the traditions of Christmas. A drawback to the book is that it has quickly lost its smells or maybe we have simply sniffed the smells all out too quickly. Another drawback, like most children's books today, the author uses passive, lazy verbs when more vivid verbs could have been used, such as the author's writing ""had"" instead of ""ate"" or ""gobbled"". Overall, The Sweet Smell of Christmas is a worth-purchasing book."
4,Classic Scratch & Sniff book,"I had this book as a child and loved it. A sweet story about Little Bear and his parents preparing for Christmas. Getting a tree, decorating, baking, waiting for Santa. Features 6 scratch & sniff stickers. Apple Pie, Pine Tree (my favorite), Candy Cane, Gingerbread, Hot Chocolate, Orange. Just as I remember from my own book as a child, the Gingerbread and Hot Chocolate are a bit faint compared to the others. However, I still love the book and I'm hoping that my niece will love it as well."
2,Can't smell the stickers very well,I wasn't happy with the scratch and sniff stickers. It's hard to tell what the smell is. I wouldn't purchase this again.
3,Very cute book for preschoolers,"Very cute book... My two year old really got a kick out of the scratch and sniff aspect of the book, but the story is only so-so..."
3,Sweet Smell of a Book,"I ordered this for my son for his first Christmas, based on a recommendation from a parenting website that I respect. I agree that it is a nice Christmas story, but ours has absolutely no scents at all. My 5 year old niece read the book and complained that it ""just smells like a book"". Sorry folks, the stickers are stale. If they sold a replacement pack of stickers for it, I would buy it. In fact, that's why I came on Amazon tonight, although nothing appears to fit the bill. The scents you need for the book are: apple pie, pine, peppermint candy cane, gingerbread cookie, hot chocolate, and orange. If the scents worked, I would give it 5 stars."
2,DIsappointed,"I thought the concept sounded really nice, as scratch and sniff can be fun for children. The book is colorful and the sniff spots are all themed with Christmas baking traditions which is nice, however the main event of the simple story is Saint Nicholas arrival to bring gifts to the little bear and the other associated myths, rather than the true celebration of Christmas as Jesus wonderful arrival."
5,The Sweet Smell of Christmas,I am 28 years old and a mother of two small children. I would love to be able to share the memories I have of this book with my children. However my copy has a few pages torn and the scratch and sniff stickers no longer smell. I would love to see this book back in print.
5,Sweet Smell of Christmas,I too have this adorable book and enjoyed it so much growing up. Now that I am a mother I have read this book to my children. Sorry to say it wasn't taken care of like it should have been and we could really use a new one. PLEASE share this wonderful book with us again!
2,Sweet Smells of Christmas,This book is part of my family's Christmas traditions. My oldest daughter is 14 and she has scratched the scent completely off of the book pages from enjoying it so much. I now have two younger children and they are missing out on a wonderful book and Christmas memory for my daughter and myself. I hope it will be back in print before my children are too old to appreciate it. PLEASE PRINT MORE COPIES AND PUT ME ON THE LIST TO PURCHASE ONE OR TWO!
5,A must have for young children!,This was our children's absolute favorite Christmas book ever! What a shame it's no longer available to purchase for our nieces and nephews! We loved this delightful Christmas tale of a young bear who patiently waits for Christmas. Would recommend this book to everyone who loves Christmas.
3,Sweet Smell of Christmas,"My only child - who is now 37 years old - enjoyed this book so much when he was little (I loved it as well!)! Even though that same book is still in good condition, I wanted to buy his 2-year old daughter a NEW one so she could enjoy the wonderful smells of apple pie, gingerbread, etc. Unfortunately, I am VERY disappointed that most of the smells of the NEW book are very faint. The pine cone is the only strong scent."
4,reliving my childhood,I had this same scratch n sniff book when I was a child. I loved these books! I hope to see more of them on amazon. My 3 year old loves them too.
5,30 and reliving my childhood!,"This book is one of my favorites from my childhood. I remember sniffing the Hot Chocolate, it was my favorite. I didn't remember the title of this book until I searched for scratch n sniff books on Amazon.com and when I saw this book, the memories came flooding back to me. I immediately purchased it for my 2 boys. I hope they will enjoy it as much as I did."
4,Nice memory book,"I bought this book when I wanted to recall some of this book's scents from my childhood. The scented pads are not exactly as potent as I remember, they are less textured, but the scents of pine, oranges, peppermint, hot chocolate, and others do come through. This book was a very good purchase. I would definately buy it as a gift for children or adults who remember this book for Christmas."
5,I miss the 80's!!!,This was my FAVORITE book as a little girl and I just bought my daughter a copy the other day! She loves it! (she's 6) I am so glad this book is still being published...oh what memories!
1,I don't get it.,"If you're normal, neither will you. This book is nothing but filth that doesn't make any sense. My daughter gave it to me to read because the author was one of her college instructors. Don't waste your time or money!"
5,"Spectacular, full of beautiful reproductions, big size","This 11 x 12.6 inches (28 x 32 cm) book, beautifully published on crispy white glossy paper, contains way over 100 excellent color reproductions mostly of a big size. The color accuracy is as good as it can get. The book is divided into chapters reflecting chronological periods of the artist's life described in detail. The art works are accompanied by thorough analysis. There are also chapters containing life chronology, glossary, selected bibliography, and photographic credits. This is a spectacular book."
2,Missing Cheryl,"Cheryl has disappeared from Season 8, leaving Larry without a foil. There is no counter-Larry. This leaves an odd, gaping hole in the series. I loved seasons 1-7, but Larry without his usual buddies seems irrelevant. There's very little connecting one episode to the next in this season."
3,Not Quite as Funny---,"I have been a devoted fan of ""Friends"" and ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" w/Larry David himself.This particular season is not as good as the others. I believe that (almost) ""killing"" off the Cheryl Hines character, his wife on the show, has diminished the humourous situations.Suzie and Wanda continue being great additions, and of course great best pal Jeff, Richard, etc. A great cast, and worth watching, but I miss Cheryl.Th Eighth Season was not as funny or engaging."
4,Curb Your Enthusiasm,Great now I have all of the Curb Your Enthusiasm collections glad to now have the final DVD. The DVD shows well
5,Great!!!!,I love curb your enthusiasm and this season didn't disappoint!!! Would recommend this to anyone who loves Larry David and the crew
5,He's a comical genius.,This season was just as hilarious as the one's with Cheryl. I especially loved the Palestinian kebab vs the Jewish deli episode. No comedy today can hold a candle to Curb.
5,best show out there,If you liked Seinfeld you will love this show. If you do not like Seinfeld you will love this show!!
5,Best season ever!,This season was the funniest so far. Larry relocates to New York and it is good to see him on his home turf. Guest appearance by Robert Smigal (the voice of Triumph the insult comic dog) is the best. Bill Buckner is equally as funny in this episode.
5,awesome,it always makes me laugh excellent excellent choice I give it 5 stars because I love Larry David.. 00 did I say I really really love the show
1,New York culture not as funny as California,"I have always loved this show and watched all the episodes set in California. Season 8 tries to incorporate New York culture into the mix. Sorry, not nearly as funny.The psychiatrist is too boringly traditional/predictable and the baseball guy too over-the-top, stereotypical New Yorker.I went from loving this show to not being able to watch the entire Episode 1 of Season 8. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
3,big hands,This is ok- just like the other seven. Am I the only one to see that Larry David has the hugest hands ever?
4,Sarcasm Galore,"Larry David is in fine form this season. He is his usual obnoxious selfish self, with a cast of characters playing themselves, like Michael J. Fox and NY Mayor Bloomberg. Susie is her usual vulgar self, picking on hubby Jeff and Larry, who disgusts her, most of the time. Thus far, my favorite season."
5,Very Best of Fritz Wunderlich,"Fritz Wunderlich is still one of the Best. This CD is very good value for money, such a variety of songs, excellent tone quality."
1,Waste of $,You are NOT buying the whole series... just one dvd in the series for anywhere between 40 - 300 dollars! FOR A SINGLE DVD! Do not fall to this gimmic!
3,REQUIEM,"I've heard better performances, but since is one of the few sung in English, it is OK. Better to sing in German."
5,I Highly Recommend!,"I am the webowner of Mental Health Today.I highly recommend this book for any family undergoing a separation or divorce where the children are old enough to understand.The book is written for the child and easily gets your attention. The plot is interesting with ""Professor Skye"" as the ten year old boy's helper who is assisting him in understanding ""life.""It is common for children not to verbalize to their parents what they are feeling during a divorce, and the parents obviously are undergoing enough battles of their own.This book may answer some of your child's questions that you may not be aware that he/she has."
5,"One of the Most diverse, eclectic, exotic, fun bands around.",I have to say that Ozomatli is one of those bands that just makes you groove. I listened to them after a friend allowed me to and I was so incredibly impressed that I bought the CD. Ozomatli captures the essence of a latin-funk-reggae LA groove that I have never heard before. I am by no means latino nor a minority but I have to say that I feel like anyone who listens to them gets the true sense of community and the idea of any kind of UNITY. I think oZomatli should tour more and I would love to see them live. Email me if you share the same opinion. Ozo is some of the very best true music I have ever heard.
5,El Primo para Ozo,"I bought the Ozomatli complete output of 2 CD's backwards, first ""Embrace the Chaos"" and next their self-titled debut. Of the two, it's hard to say which is better...it's a toss-up. It's pretty much a non-stop party with a world tour throughout the album sometimes making disparate stops all within the same song...but it works wonderfully.There is hip-hop, ska, reggae, jazz, flamenco, funk, salsa, mariachi, eastern tinge, western energy, you name it, its here. The prevailing flavors though are a variety of Latino styles across the board and street hip-hop. The production and sound is actually better on this CD vice their second release ""Embrace the Chaos"". But the hip hop for me is more alive on ""Embrace the Chaos.""Standout tracks are ""Como Ves"", ""Super bowl Sundae"", and ""Cut Chemist Suite."" It's difficult to remain in your seat when these are playing. Ozomatli just has a good feel to the music. Go buy this and wear it well...all around the world."
5,Their music will take you into a whole other world!!!,"I have seen Ozo perform over 20 times and they are an incredible group of men who love what they do and are very good at it. Not only do they love music but they love the people. They are there for us and they are the voice for every single one of us. They represent us to the fullest and I love them for that. The diversity is amazing, their personalities are joyful, and their music will take you into a whole other world. If you havent heard their music, open your mind and soul to something new, something real, powerful, and best of all positive! Viva Ozomatli;Aztec God of Dance"
5,A True Head Nodder.,"Man, this is the type of album that you would cruise around in your car with and just bang your head away.Horns, drums, deep vocals.. YES.Ozomatli is dope.Ozomatli is: Chali 2na (from Jurassic 5), Cut Chemist (cuttin it up!), Raúl ""El Bully"" Pacheco, Ulises Bella, Jiro Yamaguchi, Jose ""Crunchy"" Espinosa, Wil-Dog, William ""Echo"" Marrufo, Pablo Castorena, Justin ""Niño"" Porée, and Asdru Sierra.BUY THIS ALBUM ON VINYL, CD, AND CASSETTE! BUY ALL THEIR MATERIAL!PEACE!"
5,East Coast,"My friend from Cali introduced me to this band and I immedately loved them. From start to finish it is a great album, to the point where I bought all of their cds. Definately new and original."
4,This has to be in the top 5 of Bowie albums!,"The only way I know how to rate an album is song by song. Here is how I rate the songs from top to bottom, 11 songs in total. 5,5,4,2,3,3,5,5,4,4,3. Total is 43 out of 55 possible points. A very solid 4 out of 5 stars. The now unemployed former East German Judge would be around 35 points(still not bad) with the U.K. Judge coming in around 50 points.Although I have enjoyed the last few Bowie albums, this is the one that really gets my attention. It is very good! Boy, a couple of these songs just can't be ignored by the radio stations-even the pop top 40 stations. ""Days"" and ""New Killer Star"" are bonifide hits if played. Mr. Bowie may not be striving for top 40 hits at the moment, but I sure think he has two of them. This album has rock and soul, a little classic Beatles, a little classic Bowie, and alot new Bowie. The album artwork is ""cool"", my favorite of all David Bowie albums."
2,Is everybody on this site on drugs?,"Station to Station, Low, Let's Dance; these are the classic Bowie albums. Heck, even Outside was great. But Reality is just a horrible album. It's not like I want it to be horrible. I wish it was a great album, but wishing won't make it so. The lyrics to Never Get Old are absolutely laughable. I love Bowie but not every album he's done is great. You guys should learn to accept that. The only readon I gave this two stars was because it has 'Days'. One of Bowie's most sincere songs. A song which many of you overlooked in your glowing reviews in favor of such turds as Never Get Old. Maybe ballads are what Bowie should be doing now. He still has such a lovely voice but he rarely uses it with any conviction any more."
3,Could take it or leave it,"Things looked really good with the releases OUTSIDE, EARTHING, and HOURS, even HEATHEN had it's moments, but as much as I love Bowie's music, This left me flat. I tried to let it grow on me even in altered states of mind but to no avail. This album is by no means horrible, but measured against the last decade of his work, this is the weakest link in the chain. Then again, maybe I'm wrong to hold this album against others. You listen, you decide"
4,David Loves New York,"Let me start by saying that I am an old school Bowie fan. My very first LP was Diamond Dogs. That said, Reality, DB's latest release is a fun ride through post millenial NY. As a frequent visitor and lover of NYC, I can hear the city woven throughout the songs. This is, however, not a concept album. Reality is also not nearly as dark as Heathen another 'NY album'. Reality is a collection of rock and roll pop songs, that do not pander to a particular genre or audience. Many reviewers have compared this album to various stages of DB's past. How could one not notice these references!?! But they are only references. Reality is the product of a skilled artist and entrepreneur knows how to craft quality music (and product).Why 4 stars? This is not a genre defining milestone like Ziggy, Diamond Dogs, or Heroes. If you are looking for groundbreaking work, lighten up or buy another album. This release is undeniably pop. But it's also a fun ride through Gotham with the top down."
3,Some New Killer Tunes (3.5 stars),"There are SOME songs on Reality that are quite good, including the first single, New Killer Star. Couple that with the stark, almost creepy, facade of Bring Me The Disco King, and you off to a very, very good start. Unfortunately, The Richman cover, Pablo Picasso, hits as the second track and is pretty weak. BUT the rest of the record is very enjoyable Bowie fare. The Loneliest Guy is another stark atmospheric landscape brilliantly painted by producer Tony Visconti. The same rings true for She'll Drive The Big Car (albeit a faster tempo). Long gone is the wailing of Reeves Gabriels' guitar, and what we're left with is another back to basics Bowie record. Much like, but ultimately much better than, Heathen. Reality sees our thin white Duke still creating the stuff of most artists' dreams."
3,Nothing new.,"I was bit disappointed by this highly anticipated Bowie album. It's not that songs are bad, but it's just that I don't ""feel"" anything spectacular about this album. When I buy Bowie's album, I expect it to be something special, something unique, but this one didn't do it for me (maybe I was expecting too much?) That said, I still like the songs in Reality, but don't expect too much. It's not Aladdin Sane, that's for sure."
4,Good Effort,"I ENJOY sitting on my couch and listening to this record. That can't be said about too many records these days. I hate it when people over analyse and try to compare it to albums he did decades ago. No it won't be remembered with his great albums, but who cares? If you have enjoyed Bowie's last few efforts (""Heathen"" & ""Hours"") this one should be no different."
4,Not my favorite but a great album anyway,"Reality is still Bowie quality; I think most fans should purchase it if they haven't already. However, I find that I'm not listening to that one as much as Earthling, Heathen or even Let's Dance (a timeless classic). Most songs on the CD are amazing, catchy and highly creative; in this, Reality is pure excellent Bowie. ""Looking for water"", however, is the reason why the CD stays on the shelf most of the time. It's noisy, repetitive and downright annoying if you ask me.One of the things I enjoy most about Bowie is that his albums are usually pure pleasure to listen to from beginning to end; no bad songs, it's success after success. For Reality, I have to actually get up and go skip that one song, which bother me."
3,Ha Ha Ha Hee Hee Hee. All the way to the Bowie Bank.,"Delivered by a band of experienced sessioneers we have mostly a big muscular Tin Machine sound allied to some retro Glam-Rock decorated with some pretty dumb lyrics.I stopped listening to DB after Tonight and Tin Machine 1, and haven't missed anything, so far as I can hear from this outing.The less seasoned DB fen should find this comparatively okay, but I think he needs to freshen it up a bit and get away from the Laughing Gnome lyrics."
1,Bring back Carlos Alomar,"There just hasn't been a good Bowie album since Bowie became as ass and stopped writing with Carlos Alomar. Where are the songs!!! Where is the invention!!! Where is the growth!!! David, admit it Carlos made your career!!!!!"
2,run of the Mill,David Bowie had a solid 70's run&then came back for a minute in the Mid 80's but since then He hasn't been able to find that touch at picking good material.this album follows a line of Half-Baked cuts that at best might be worthy of B-Sides but don't merit Album tracks.I got to Hear this set recently&just wasn't feeling it.
4,"he's old, but he's still good","David Bowie is a great singer and is hipper than other geezers like Bob Dylan and Neil Young. This is a great album of cool tunes. Bowie isn't as good as Justin Timberlake, but this record ain't bad for someone his age. Check it out!"
2,"Not the ""real"" thing...",Bowie has started making albums that superficially resemble his best old days. This is another one but there's really not much here.
1,Bowie finally sold himself out!,"At 56 years of age, Bowie finally became ""Rolling Stones-esque"" rocker, i.e. putting up albums just for commercial reasons and make few bucks off of them. DO NOT buy this album! It's so unoriginal, it's made up of teeny pop songs to attract younger audiences. Huge disappointment."
2,Bowie not at his best,"Being a huge fan of Bowie, I was looking so forward to his follow up to Heathen which was such a classic Bowie album. However, I was and continue to be disappointed by this album.It starts off well with the track 'New Killer Star' but even that song wears thin with it's insipid ""ready set go"" and wimpy chorus. The songs are very ordinary (which Bowie can do well - see 'Hours') and boring but with some bright spots. Bowie's version of 'Pablo Picasso' is an artsy rocker in the vein of 'Heathen's' 'Cactus', 'Fall Dog Bombs the Moon' is good and the lounge lizard tune 'Bring Me The Disco King' is interesting but otherwise a bit of a blip in Bowie's catalogue as far as I am concerned. Still love ya' though God - oops I mean David."
1,"Voice is gone, cd is a blur except for guitar","I hear so many sounds, calypso, harry connick jr, and a narrow range of voice on this cd. Not one song sent me and his artwork matched his music, chaotic and unoriginal, Sequieros eyes. Once I heard it I didnt want to play it again. I think a guitar instrumental would have been better. I guess his collage style of writing has run dry. That is why he shouts water, water."
2,Jeremy,"Reality is not as derivative as most of Bowie's music. Rather, it has a flat, generic sound that seems to be coming from several different places. The best thing I could say about Heathen and Reality is that they are boring, which is is an improvement from the awful music he made during the 80s and 90s. The serious-sounding cover of the Modern Lovers' ""Pablo Picasso"" is baffling. The only reason I even bothered listening is because Visconti is back in the loop, but not even he can bring Bowie's music back to life. Bowie's vocals sounds worse on every album. He used to have a versatile voice, but now he is only capable of a low murmur."
4,Bowie salutes the silent beatle,"Wow! Who would have thought listening to an obscure song from George Harrison's 1973 ""Living in the Material World"" on Bowie's latest Cd? This version alone pays having this CD! A kind of Spectoresque wall of sound is present on the version, but Bowie reinvents the song keeping the beautiful harmony (which somehow comes more alive in Bowie's version than in George Harrison's one), but covering it up with interesting layers of soundscapes that put you somewhere else from ""the material world"". The last song of the album is also exquisitely crafted; a totally unexpected fantastic surprise. Highly recommended!"
4,EXCELLENT WORK IF YOU CAN HANDLE REPEATED LISTENS,"In the context of today's music I would rate Reality a 5 star recording, but obviously compared to past Bowie classics like Hunky Dory etc I cannot. I bought Heathen a couple years ago and really liked it quite quickly. When Reality came out so soon afterward I had to buy it based on hearing and quite liking Heathen but I admit my expectations were low....Without being long-winded I'll put it plain and simple: this album requires many, many repeated listens. If you have the patience to do that, you will slowly start to love this album. Happy listening."
4,A different world,"Reality is a great escape. The vocals are amazing and the hooks are addictive. Bowie is a timeless legend and will always make great music. I love that this album is outside the box and that the songs hit you. The guitar rifts and editing are amazing. The songs all belong together on this album and the sound is intoxicating. The best songs are ""New Killer Star"" and ""Days"". ""New Killer Star"" has a driving beat and origanlity. ""Days"" is a song that haunts you and the chord changes are so fluent. The whole album is a detour from the usual. This is music."
5,An invaluable resource!,"As a mid-lifer, looking back over a 25 year span and trying to remember all of the situations in which prior learning had occurred, at first seemed impossible. Yet, broken down into bite-sized pieces, Roslyn Snow made it a piece of cake! Although the process was time-consuming, what could have been an overwhelming task became a simple one. This easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide shows how to earn the maximum college credits in an Assessment for Prior Learning Program. I couldn't have done it without this invaluable resource!"
3,needed for a class,"This book provides, in my opinion, a guide towards a valuable need- an online resume. The theory in the book is very valuable, but the technological info is dated- you can really tell the book was written 10 years ago. So that was frustrating."
5,five stars,"I agree. Good music, ultra good sound and very much ambiance. Since I am from the Netherlands, I can be proud. And that price! Do not leave this recording untouched because you will regret that! Five stars for everything: strings, percussion, horns, pace ..."
5,What a Bargain!!!,"This is one of the best recordings of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique. Mariss Jansons leads the amazing Royal Concertgebow in a knock-out performance. The winds, strings, percussion, they're all ultra powerful. Make sure you turn up your stereo for this one. If you want to hear Symphonie fantastique at a bargain price, this is your disc."
3,Great Ideas for Candid Photography,"PEOPLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT is another how to book from Pro-Photo. The purpose of this book is not to show studio photographs, but to take candid shots that have the quality of a studio photograph. The photographs are not simply snap shots. The photographs are taken in the natural setting of every day life truly tell a story. Like other Pro-Photo books, it is somewhat short on how to techniques, and since it was first published before the dawn of digital equipment, the technical information in this book issomewhat sparse. Yet Jonathan Hilton, the book's author and photo editor, again selects exquisite photographs that will inspire anyone who loves photography to take beautiful pictures."
4,Tattoo Blues,"Purchased used book through Amazon.com. Skipped past the 1-cent sales versions of the book to find one which the vendor rated the condition as ""very good""; not necessarily so. It was, however, a pleasant read. Not quite as good as ""Oyster Blues"" but worth the time. Mr McClelland is a talented writer who develops delightfully flawed characters and spins an entertaining yarn."
4,What fun!,"This book is preposterously fun! The author continues to introduce the wonderfully eccentric characters -- it's impossible to get bored and altho the end is somewhat predictable (reason for 4 and not 5 stars), it is enjoyable, completely angst free, entertaining and leaves one feeling happy -- not a bad deal. Anxious to read more from this funny guy."
2,ANOTHER EVEREST MEMOIR FROM 1996,"I expected a dramatic book about mountaineering (in the beginning), survival, and determination but got mainly a memoir about family problems, bouts with depression, childhood and earlier climbs. I really tried to like Beck and I do admire his ability to come back from death and recover; but does one need all this drama and trauma to make a man realize that his family and loved ones come first and are the main things in life, and you don't have to climb a giant mountain to understand? In my observations, I always find obsessions a bit weird and off-center in life. In fairness to Beck, the 1996 story has been professionally and strategically told by others, so maybe he and his ghost writer had to fluff up the pages to make a book. There was definitely enough for a great magazine story but a stretch to find over 300 pages to keep the reader interested. Enough said...Beck, hope you're back on the job and helping others like so many helped you. Mabuhay!"
2,Not much of an Everest book,"I read this book and was severely disappointed in the story. I've read a lot of the accounts from the 1996 tragedy and Beck Weathers story was particularly fascinating. I truly expected someone who came back to life to really have something good to say, lessons learned, but that was not what I got out of the book. He does not seem contrite that he left his family alone most of the time for years for his climbing pursuits, comes back half dead needing them desperately. The book makes me think he'd do it over again and did not learn much from his ordeal. His wife seems extremely bitter (probably not unjustified)."
3,Enough Already!,"By about halfway through I was bored with this book. I read this book because I thought it would be about his experience on everest, how he got off, and how it changed his life. If that is what you want to know about then read the first three and the last three chapters and you will have read just that. However, this book talks more about his life growing up and his wife. I think what bothered me most about this book is that the opinions of his wife, kids and friends are interjected. A lot of the time they all repeat what the first person had said. There are even times in the book where his wife and him are arguing within the text. It is almost like they sat down and told the story to someone else who recorded it and they wrote exactly what they had said. Disagreements and all."
3,"An enjoyable, non-technical read","I checked this book out of the library for my husband to read because he is interested in mountain climbing. Once I got it home, I started to skim through it, and could not put it down! I thought the first part about the Mt. Everest climb was very interesting and I wish there was more description of the climb and the experiences that happened on the mountain. After reading this, I cannot understand why anyone would want to climb mountains. Every climb Beck described sounded like hell. I cannot believe how terrible he was to his wife and family, and they still stayed with him. I agree that most of the family stuff was boring. It also made Beck out to be a very unlikeable person, not worthy of much sympathy. The person that amazed me the most in the entire book was Madan KC. Just reading about his selfless, heroic act was worth reading the entire book.."
2,Don't bother.,"It may seem unkind to trash a book written by someone who survived the terrible ordeal that Mr. Weathers did. However, I really think this is a dreadful book. It reads like a religious tract: man becomes separated from his family due to his obsession with (insert alcohol, gambling, work or mountaineering here), barely survives through miraculous intervention, and is a changed man from that day onward. There's almost no description of climbing here. The Everest expedition is over within the first few chapters! Instead, most of the book is a long history of Weathers' childhood and family life; why this should interest anyone is unclear. If you're looking for a book about climbing, adventure or the beauties of nature, avoid this."
1,Not for mountaineers,"If you like to read about real mountaineering, try a book by Joe Simpson or Jon Krakauer. If you want to read a book about a guy who blows off his family to climb, and all the damage he does because of it, then this book is ideal for you.I was hoping to read a survival story, instead I got family dynamics."
2,Give me a Break!,"This is definately no ""Into Thin Air"" or other excellent Himalayan climbing book. It dwells on Mt Everest for the first quarter of the book, and then we have to put up with the medical, amputations and problems with his wife. Virtually no photos, just a rambling tale of the aftermath of the disaster, I have all the sympathy in the world for Dr Weathers, but planning the story ahead of time would've mad it a much better read in my opinion."
3,Everest and beyond,"I've read numerous mountaineering books, particularly about Everest. This didn't disappoint from page 1, and the first 89 pages are as gripping as they come. The tone changes once Beck comes down from the mountain, and becomes an autobiographical, self-analytical tome about his life, before and after Everest.It was still interesting, and good to get to know more about the character who so nearly lost his life, but I found I wanted more excitement. It's why we city-slickers read mountaineering books, to get that vicarious thrill.But as I say, I enjoyed getting to know him, and now I want to go back the Part 1, to re-read the thrilling part. Because now I know him, now I care.Cheers and take care this coming Everest season x"
5,Left for Dead,Especially liked the story of his private life and the impact climbing had on his marriage and family along with the story of Everest. Would highly recommend.
1,Skip It!,"I have not read this book and will take the advice of those who have said to ""skip it"". I am still mystified why everyone of the experts ignores Anatoli Boukreev who was the only one to save anyone on the '96 expedition. Krakauer and the rest of them tried to point the finger at Boukreev as some sort of negligent and uncaring person and apparently have been successful in denigrating this heroic man. Weathers was in a spot he never should have been, Krakauer, Hall and the rest of them knew it before the whole thing started but did nothing. They were more interested in the commercial aspects of the entire journey. I am not interested in Weather's personal life."
4,And you thought you had read it all,"Having read just about all the books that are out regarding the 1996 Everest expedition I didn't have much hope that Dr. Weathers would have anything much to add. But I was wrong, I was surprized by his openness and surprised too to hear the rest of his story. It's an amazing story in more ways than one. Dr. Weathers has a way of writing that is very personal, almost like you could hear him speaking. I enjoyed his droll sense of humor, dotted though out the book and learing how his mountaineering career got started, the training that he did. I liked the comments from his wife and kids I though they added another dimension to the story."
3,The 1996 Everest Disaster through the eyes of Beck Weathers.,"Unbelievable. That's all I can say. There isn't a soul on this planet that could even begin to comprehend what Beck Weathers went through high in ""The Death Zone"". This man literally defied death, having been left for dead 3 times and surviving by sheer force of will and his love for his family. This side of the 1996 tragedy hasn't been told until now. Several books have been written about that fateful climb, but Weathers' account delves much deeper than that deadly storm. He gives us all a look into what drives many of us to reach for such lofty and deadly goals."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting more of an account of the actual Everest event, which I had previously read about in Jon Krakauer's excellent book. This was a poorly written account of the author's time on the mountain, with much more gratuitous writing about his relationship with his wife. While I ultimately did finish the book, I wondered why they felt the reader would be interested in much of the book past Part One, and why they felt compelled to share this personal information. Proceed with caution."
3,Worth reading but it could have been better,"I have been fascinated by the 1996 disaster on Everest after having read Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air."" I then read Anatoli Boukreev's ""The Climb"" and Matt Dickinson's ""Other Side of Everest"" before reading Beck Weather's ""Left for Dead."".I found the first part of this book very interesting but it lost me in the part about his recovery. Too long and just not as interesting reading for me.An ok read but doesn't compare to the other ones I have read about the tragedy.For other books that I found gripping and well worth reading, see my other reviews or my listmania list. I am an avid reader of true adventure and/or survival stories."
4,Some insight as to what happened,"You kind of have to dig to find out what Dr. Weathers really thinks about the whole Everest 96 disaster. Bottom line: He was climbing when he should have been husbanding. The most telling line in the book: Boukreev didn't stay with the people who paid him to guide them. When he did make his way up to the South Col, he only bothered to save the ones in his expedition."
2,Part One was GREAT....,"But the rest of the book was a big yawn. I really did not feel personally involved enough with the author to read through his tedious 200+ page life story. If you are after an account of what happened on that fateful climb, stick to ""The Climb"" or ""Into Thin Air""."
2,Not Climbing,"Porly orgainzed and scattered. About half way through I strted skipping over the family stuff. I got for the climbing story - don't buy - borrow and skim for the climbing (still weak, but it does give antoehr view of may 96 on Everest)."
2,expected more,"Somehow, Beck Weathers managed to write a book about the tragic climb and descent and death and coming back to life atop Everest totally boring. Enjoyed Beck and Peach's chapters on their cats more than anything."
4,Why climb a mountain?,"Pretty much the autobiography of how a man almost lost his life on Everest, but somehow recovered his body and soul in the end. This book has got some nice insights into what attracts a man to climb the mountains. But sometimes it wander too far off to tell us about the author's martial affairs that don't really concern with the main plot of the story."
2,Interest in Everest? Find another book,"All readers are intrigued by life and death struggles such as conquering Everest. If drama, suspense, excitement, and insight into a near death experience from a personal perspective are your interest, you won't find it here. Every chance the authors get to instill the feeling of what it must have been like to endure this expedition, they fall short. Its as though this book was written as an epilogue to ""Into Thin Air"". This book never takes you anywhere. The style of conversation-blocking with family members and friends smacks of a journalist transcribing tape-recorded conversations. If you want to taste Beck's emotional experience, you will have to hear him in person - there is no comparison. But if you want to know the fury of Everest - find another book."
2,A Brave Attempt to Make Up to His Wife,"Dr. Weathers clearly has undergone a terrible tragedy; however the tone of this book is clearly one of hopeful self-flagellation--""maybe if I beat myself up enough about what a jerk I have been others will stop doing so themselves!"" Let's hope his wife doesn't let him forget. Not very well written, but it is faily entertaining."
2,Too much family,"The parts about climbing were very good. But just too much of his personal problems to be a 'climbing' book - might be good for those who want to know about the problems of depression/etc.Seem he, like many other who wrote about that tragedy, did a book for self healing. Which is OK.But it did help me better understand somthing's bout Everest in May of 96. I have read most of the other books about that tragedy. Any one of which puts a different slant on what happened - read 'em all."
2,Beck Weather's Left for Dead,"I am an avid reader of mountain adventures, sailing adventures, caving adventures and the like. I like fast-paced, riveting stories, with a good balance between background information and excitement.I first heard about Beck Weahters and his ordeal when reading Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air."" So I ordered Beck Weather's ""Left For Dead."" I was disappointed.It was ok but not as good as others I have read. The part about the climb was excellent, the part about his recovery dragged on, and the part about how he has grown from his ordeal was ok. I became bored very quickly about his writings of his wife Peach.Ok book, but not great."
1,Absolutely horrible,"This book should have been fantastic. Beck Weathers went through hell on the side of the mountain and could tell one of the greatest adventure stories ever. Unfortunately what the book contains is a lot of self congratulating about past accomplishments, needless anecdotes,and most irritatingly, a lengthy argument between him and his wife about who is the worse spouse.If you want to read about the Everest disaster go out and get Anatoli Boukreev's The Climb or Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. Both of these books focus on the event itself, not boring filler."
2,good start,"All though a good start, the core and ending was thin.I expected more of a mountain story and less of a personal feeling thing i suppose, but i do appreciate the post trauma of a tuff climb. Krakauar's account entertained supreme, however after reading Lobsang's and Anatoli's points of view i think he may have somewhat missed the bulls eye. The I-MAX struck me as completely avoiding the great opportunity of recording this event. Weather's view is an introspective purge that i would not recomend paying twentyfive dollars to view."
5,A Man's second chance at life,"In this book called Left for Dead by Beck weathers, is an inttinse survival story. An experienced climber by the name of beck weathers is determined to climb mnt. Everest, his dreams are crushed by a fatal avalanche, trapping his team and hisself. After his team escapes and they aranged the the dead bodies and they left. Little did the know he wasn't dead! He wander around everest seeking life or the way out of the mountain. There are plenty of intense moment and thrilling parts of the book. Iwould reccomend this book to anyone.whritten by Josh g."
3,The adventure and the recovery,"When reading other books about the May 1996 tragedy on Mount Everest I got more interested in the man who was declared dead, but then miraceously escaped the maountain. So I was really happy to find this book. The first part of this book tells the story from his own perspective. The second part of the book is more about his life in general and the recovery. The book is definitely worth reading, but after such a thrilling opening the second half gets a bit of a transportation to the end."
1,"another ""96 Everest tragedy"" book ?","Yet another book on the 96 Everest tragedy....while an account by a well known (and good writer) Krakauer might be of interest, the story somehow looses any pigment when related for the 15th times by someone who should never have been there in the first place. Here is an account by someone who actually shares a responsibility in the so called ""tragedy"", someone who should be ashamed of his endangering many lives, and who managed to make a fool of himself on Everest. Instead of disappearing from the public eye in the wake of his pathetic performance on Everest, he decides to write a book and join the ""let's cash on it"" club. Sad....."
4,Great Shade but not rectangular,"From the 13x11 description, I assumed that it was rectangular. Its a hexagon! Not as easy to fit on deck but we made it work. Easy to assemble, needs no tools but definitely needs 2 people to set up. Took about an hour. Hardware provided to screw into decking to make secure. Shade is excellent but it isn't waterproof."
5,Tiny and works like a charm. Includes power supply!,"USB hubs are much like one another, and most work perfectly, so one must review them on just the subtle points. This one is inexpensive and just the right size (very small but with enough room between the plugs to avoid crowding). More importantly, it includes an AC adapter which you can use if you're plugging in devices that consume a lot of power. This is an important feature missing from some USB hubs.Despite the unfamiliar brand, I'm completely pleased with the product, and would buy it again."
5,travel DVDs,"Having been to some of the locations shown on this Rick Steves travel DVD, it was very enjoyable to see some of the features once again. These DVDs are broken down into 30 minute segments that make viewing them events that are refreshing and not tedious. We have several of these travel DVDs and really enjoy the visual travelog format."
2,Claypac V Cream,When the packaging for this product changed from the opaque white tube to the silver gray tube the product also changed. I have fine hair that doesn't get the needed boost from the new product. The new one is more moisturizing and less volumizing. I loved the old stuff. Why did they have to mess with a good thing!
4,One of the very few books that covers the design of Manual Gearboxes,"I wish this book had more practical design information on Manual Transmissions, but as it is there is some good information for the engineer."
4,"Daughter loves them, but could use some improvments","I got these for my 8 year old daughter. She will NOT take them off!!She loves them but I think they could be made a bit better.The material is a bit flimsy, not as thick as a shoe would be.The tongues of the skates dont stay in place, that annoys me but my daughter does not seem to mind that I have to untie and fix the tongue and retie the skate about every 5 minutes.She is a beginner skater and these seem to be doing alright for her, so they are a good starter pair. If they were a bit more thick for extra support these would be close to great.SIZING:My daughter wears a girls size 2 SHOE. I ordered a size 3 SKATE because that is what she wore at the roller rink when she rented skates. They are a bit big on her, but almost perfect fit with two pairs of socks on. So the sizing is NOT right on the dot, it might be hard for you to decide on a size, sorry!"
1,DO NOT EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS COMPANY,"I ordered a Christmas present--roller skates- from this company on December 13th. I emailed the company twice- they haven't acknowledged it. My status is listed as in process to ship...As of today, I have not received any notifications about my purchase except when I look at the status on Amazon it states that it was cancelled yesterday. After calling Amazon- who said it was not cancelled- I got the run a round from FROGDOG who finally told me they do not have the item. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY....I should have read the reviews first"
1,Terrible looking skates....,"I just received these skates and opened the package to make sure the skates were okay before giving them to my daughter Christmas morning. Much to my surprise, on the soles of these skates, the rubber is SEVERELY discolored (brownish-yellow), to the point they look like they are 20 years old. Them being jammed into the box and bent didn't really help them look very good either. Needless to say these skates are going back tomorrow...not wasting my time ordering another pair when there obviously is not much quality control at amazon."
1,Danger,"I ordered these skates for my four year old daughter. When the package arrived, the box contained a warning label that read ""this product contains a chemical that is know in the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects."". Needless to say, I called amazon immediately, and they were wonderful. Amazon is taking them back and investigating these skates to determine whether or not they nee to remove them from the site."
1,cheap,these look as cheap as something purchased in a dollar store....the kids are getting these for Christmas let's hope they at least last...but I having a feeling they won't
1,Poor quality control,Ordered these lovely looking skates and received two right skates. Pretty sad Christmas Morning for my daughter. Refund and replacement would take 30+ days. So Caveat emptor!The product may look good. I am disappointed in the manufacturer as the skates not arrive in the condition promised nor could they be replaced quickly.Too bad.
1,They sent me a replacement instead of the item ordered,I ordered this around christmas and they must have ran out after I made the purchase because they sent me a pair of roller rink skates not the ones I ordered. There was no note in the box or option to send back and get my shipping/money for purchase back. I kept the other skates which were valued for more than these but I don't know if I would trust this seller if buying a product that I would not want a replacement for.
3,granddaughter likes these skates,The skates are great for a beginner my only complaint is that it is hard to make them fit secure with only three lace eyelets.They are great for a beginner.
5,Great value,I bought these for my daughter's 9th birthday. They are great skates for the money. She loves the look and says they are very comfortable. Size runs normal.
4,skates,"I bought these skates for my granddaughter's birthday. She loved them and said ""they were exactly what she wanted"". They arrived in plenty of time for her special day."
3,Could Use Some Improvements,"Comfortable fit and works great. My daughter wears a size 4 shoe and these skates could easily be labeled as a size 5.The tongue slides to the size easily. This problem could be resolved by adding a tongue loop to secure the tongue with the laces, adding more eye holes, to lace the shoe all the way to the top, or increasing the length of the velcro strap to make the ankle tighter.Overall these are a great pair of budget skates and any younger girl would love to own."
5,"These are great, good quality skates.","The skates arrived quickly and were well packaged with no damage. The are very nice, good quality skates and my daughters love them. I'm happy with this purchase."
4,Cute and fun,"My daughter loves them. I think the material that the toe stop is made out of may deteriorate rather quickly (it seems to rub off fast; she has only used the stops a couple of times, and there is a significant amount gone), and we will probably have to replace them sooner rather than later, but we are happy with the skates in general."
4,Skating in the city,"Grandbaby asked for skates, I searched all of the known stores to get them and my final resource was Amazon.. Well Lo and behold I found them, and the shipper got them there before Christmas.. Thanks"
5,My daughter loves her skates,They are stylish and durable and my daughter rides her skates every chance she gets. Nice product !
1,Not the color which i have ordered,I have ordered this one for my daughter. the one which i got is the black one which is for boys. She refuses to use it.
5,Its an Honor,"I would just like to say that I was honored to have my family featured in this book. My father SMSGT Paul Buege was killed in the Gulf War, and my family went through many struggles and fights with the military to honor my father in the way we wished. This book is excellent in helping the general public realize ways in which the military handles fallen heros returning home, in good and not so good ways.Brian Buege"
4,"Not an entirely ""clean"" product","For those who want to eat clean, I suggest to use other Wasa crispbreads (eg, sourdough crispbread). While the sourdough crispbread only uses whole grain rye flour, rye flour, water, yeast, dry sourdough, and salt - the multigrain crispbread ingredients include malt extract and emulsifiers."
5,"Wasa Crispbread, Multi Grain, 9.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)","Best price for Wasa Crispbread, Multi Grain, 9.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)is to order through Amazon.com ""Subscribe & Save Items"""
5,Wasa Crispbread,"Healthy, low calorie, nutrient dense, all natural, crispy, and delicious. For me it's the perfect cracker."
2,Cracker Crumbs,"I order 2 cases,(12 packs per case), every 45 days or so. In the past, a few crackers were broken. No problem. In my last 2 orders, nearly 3/4 of the crackers werw either broken or totally crumbled! When Amazon shipped the packages, there was very little packing material to protect the crackers. I currently have 2, unopened cases. Crackers or crumbs?"
1,Way too hard,I tried one bite of this cracker and had to throw it away for fear of cracking my teeth. Buy the Wasa 7 Grain instead-- the 7 grain is light and crispy.
3,-,"the 1st time i listened to this, i thought it was one of the worst electronic album's i'd ever heard. but i listened a little closer, and for the second time, and really started to like it..very fun CD..happy, cheesy, bouncy basslines..for fans of old skint stuff, bentley rhythm ace, or tongue-in-cheek british goofball techno..check it. :]"
5,A Great Book for the Whole Family!,"My daughter and I read this book at the same time and enjoyed discussing the story. The book provides kids with adventure, cultural information, and a range of interpersonal relationships. Teaches kids to make the best of a situation that initially seems negative. We can't wait for the sequel!"
1,Not so good as all that,Ugh. Stereotyped characters. Banal dialog. I had trouble getting through the first few chapters before I put it down.
2,Can't Be The Very Best,"I'm an opera neophyte but even I can tell that this inexpensive 2-disk set is a low quality production. This is a collection of late-career live performances, late-career studio performances and a few studio tracks from the 1970s. Maestro Domingo's voice is not in top form on many of the tracks, in others the orchestra drowns out the voice, and the sound is unbalanced and muddy throughout. If there's any saving grace it is that this is a diverse and unusual collection (no 'Nessun Dorma' to be found here). In my opinion these two disks are not a good introduction to the great operatic tenor Placido Domingo."
3,Insulting,"This book was.. okay.. It's kinda' realistic, but I don't know, it really insults me. It's so obviously written by an adult who knows nothing about teenagers, because it just makes the protagonist sound so stupid! The way she describes Seventeen magazine and all. If you're into super dramatic books and want something a little lighter, but still with intense over blown emotions, this book is for you."
4,Great book for younger teen girls,"I am a 13 year old, and reading this book opened my eyes. The diary format makes the story seem real. Definitely a good book for 7th or 8th grade girls in the midst of all the identity anxiety girls experience today. It's also a good book for girls who have friends or classmates who are anorexic or bulimic. It helped me see what these people are going through and that there is a way out."
3,Bulimia,"Judi is an ordinary girl; except she's overweight. Judi is in love with Richard, a boy at her school. She envies Nancy, a stick-thin girl at her school. Judi tries and tries to lose the extra weight, but always fails. Nancy becomes Judi's friend, and shares with her the biggesr secret of her life. Judi then tries the most dangerous way of losing weight. Judi is sure that this will get Richard's attention. My opinions were mixed on this book, so I gave it three stars. It kept me reading but ended poorly."
4,Fat Chance,I enjoyed this book because it is easy to read and entertaining. I like how Judi's personality shows through even we only know about her through her diary. She is funny and has her amusing obsessions and quirks. But Newman still gets her point across in a very serious manner that eating disorders have to be taken seriously. I would recommend this book to anyone who knows people with eating disorders or anyone who is interested in them.
1,Fat Chance,"I am anorexic and bulimic. I, as well as my 2 other friends [both of which have eating disorders], found this book to be extremely unrealistic. It's portrayal of eating disorders is completely inaccurate. In addition to that, it's just plain boring and the characters aren't developed at all."
3,"Difficult setup, works after it gets going","I could not get the wireless portion to connect for a while. While searching for a solution, this site was at the top of the list so I decided to post my fix here.It seems that when the 311U is configured using the ancient-looking PS Admin utility, it has a small bug/feature. PS Admin converts the wireless SSID to ALL CAPS where as my wireless network name has mixed case. Talking directly to the 311U, via a web browser, I was able to set the SSID correctly and get m'self up and running.Hope this helps."
1,D-Link never again,"Had wireless running for a year with no problems. Purchased the DP-311u for my laser-fax, made sure it was compatible with the print server. got it hooked up and all went to hell. Called tech, spent 2 days with and went from a working network to a dead dls/router (another d-link product). they recomend I send it to them for a inspection and see if I can get a replacement (ha, ha I'd be paying for shipping and that's it, over a year you get nothing). Bought a new router by Bilkin went up and setup was a breeze. But the d-link print server could not be found by 3 other computers in my home, 3 more days on the phone. Finaly gave up and am returning the item, tech suppot has no clue, they have a limited time they are allowed to spend on the phone a any given call. I hope this helps any future buyers."
1,Poor documentation!,"My DLink router and WiFi PC card, installed over a year ago, worked fine, with no installation troubles. Since then, I installed an Ethernet bridge for my PS2 and now, wanted to add the USB print server. Similar to D-Link's bridge, documentation is incomplete. I made the mistake of jumping ahead and mistakingly plugged in the power to the DP-311U before turning the printer on. Now, I have to get an RMA, send it to DLink, and wait for them to reset it, as there is no at-home reset option. DLink has an advantage with this product as there are no similar products from the major router manufacturers. Unfortunately, this translates to an expensive product with poor documentation and technical support (who could not answer if the product is compatible with my Epson product)."
3,"Not plug-and-play, but works","It took me (a computer engineer) a couple hours to figure out how to get this working. After trying DHCP (since the default IP address for the router isn't compatible with my cable modem's private sub-net) I couldn't talk to it at all through ethernet and had to by trial and error, figure out how to hard-reset it (power cycle while holding the reset button depressed). Then I could talk to it again, and just set its default IP address to one on my network (192.168.1.1). It's now been working great for weeks although I occasionally (3-5 days) need to power cycle it for some reason.I was also irritated that they didn't include a bit of ethernet patch cable for the initial setup in the package ...Never-the-less, a very useful product, just needs some work on automatic configuration."
4,"Works Great, after you're done setting up it up...","The server works great on my HP 2200. It's fast, reliable and can be easily velcro-ed to the side. Downside, it's got to be the single most difficult piece of hardware I've ever had to setup. NO WIZARD! Anyway, I followed the instructions to the letter and after setting my network IP address back to normal, the box would cease to work. I tried a bunch of things to get it to work, but in the end it was something simple. I'm using a Netgear WGR614v6 which is set to be a DHCP server. The list of available IP addresses missed the default 192.168.0.10 so the computer could not recognize it. I changed the DP-311U's default IP address in the PSadmin program and BAM! Works first try! The morale of the story, if you're running a DHCP server, check the list of IP addresses."
3,"Solid, but tricky to setup","As several other reviewers have noted, this can be a beast to setup. The difficulty, I found, comes to trying to get the dp-311u to work wirelessly. After 50 minutes of fiddling with it, I started to suspect that it might not be wireless (a mistake several other reviewers shared).The steps given by s.banks below are better than the lousy manual. But even after following them I had trouble. I eventually found that it was the MAC address security filter on my router that was preventing this thing from working wirelessly. What you have to do is: add the device to the MAC filter list, then disable MAC filtering on the router, unplug the dp-311u, re-enable the MAC filtering, then turn on the 311-u. It then started working wirelessly.I'm subtracting a star for the majorly painful setup, and another for the very limited printer compatibility list.Other than that, it seems like a solid product."
1,useful for Macintoshes,"Having interfaced a QWEST ActionTec wireless DSL modem, a DirecTV satellite internet portal with a wireless router and then configured a Hawking wireless webcam, I figured I had a clue for getting a wireless printer server running for our Macs.I'm sorry to say, I failed. I couldn't even figure out how to talk with this box. You might think they'd give it a number like 192.168.0.10 and let you connect to it, but it doesn't even connect via a wire.While trying to figure out what was wrong, I found out the awful truth. The box doesn't even support IPP, so you can't use a Macintosh with a non-Postscript printer. I punted and returned the piece of junk.P.S. The hint for the ActionTec modem: Rename your Macintosh COMPUTER when you are wired up to it or it will forget your settings when it reboots. (No I'm not making this up. Maybe all PCs are named COMPUTER or something)."
2,Hard to install,"Although I'm not a computer novice, this unit was hard to install. While the green LAN (Ethernet) light came on when plugged into the router or DSL modem, it didn't work when plugged directly into my PC or laptop. Someone here wrote that in such case you need a ""crossover"" ethernet cable (or adapter). THANK YOU! I learned that routers have the smarts to figure our what type of unit is plugged in, and automatically assign transmit and receive signals to the proper pins. My PC and laptops didn't do that, and the DP-311U wasn't smart enough either. Hence I needed the cross-over cable (just for the one-time setup). Sad thing, before I figured this out, I spoke with 2 people at D-Link's technical support; we spent easily two hours. But neither one suggested the cross-over cable. They must have had tons of calls like this before. Of course, the manual says mothing about this either. Amazing how they waste time and money."
1,Not even worth a star,"I bought this unit over a year ago and still haven't figured out how to work it. I have used the D-link wireless router with no trouble, but no matter what I do, I can't get the print server to work properly. This is after hours with their customer service people and doing everytihing possible. Based on other people's reviews this unit actually does work. It just hasn't for me."
1,DP 311U does not work for me and the tech support is terrible!,"I bought this DP-311U print server. I set it up according to the manual and i can print from different computers to the printer. However, a few hours later, it stopped working. I disconnect then reconnect everything, it started to work again. But a few hours later this same thing happened again. I called the tech people at D-link and started to explain the problem when the line was disconnected. I thought this must be an accident. I called again. After transfering to a different number and waited for about 10 minutes, i was just about to describe the problem again, the line was droped again. I checked my telephone lines, they were ok. D-link's tech support is just a waste of time. By the way, i have other similar products which work fine.Mike"
2,NOT compatible with multifunction printers,After 3 hours of banging my head against a wall I finally called Tech Support. They finally figured out that this is not compatible with multi-function computers. You can learn that on their support website but no-where in the standard documentation that comes with it.
2,Configuration is big task,"I bought the product 2 weeks before and I have a thought this will work with all printers but not. D Link technical support is very bad I called at least 10 times to find my printer is compatible or not.User manual is not complete so configuration is very difficult. Changing the IP Address manually and re assigning the new IP Address is very difficult. And it cause problem for other wireless divices (Mouse,Keyboard,Wireless web camera and External wireless hard disk). Because of this product I spend almost 8 hrs to solve other wireless network issues.If you have enough time then it will entertain you."
4,Another great story by Ellis,"Warren Ellis's X-Calibre is perhaps the best contribution to Marvel's Age of Apocalypse. In many ways, the story is like the Elseworlds tales that DC comics run. Ellis has taken the characters we all know and love and placed them in a very different, darker world, which is perfectly suited for his style of writing. This is worth reading for the new spin on Nightcrawler alone. The art is also terrific (even for an ""X"" book, which is saying something). i think some people may have avoided picking up X-Calibre if they weren't fans of the Excalibur series, which is too bad because they missed out on the best written chapter of the whole Age of Apocalypse."
1,DEAR OLD DADDY,"This 1971 British ""horror"" film is certainly one of the most befuddling and confusing ones I've seen. Horror vet Michael Gough (BATMAN, KONGA, HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM) stars as a nasty abusive father and husband, and dotes only on his successful son Rupert. Mother Edith and daughter Jane conspire to kill dear old dad to get him out of their lives. They manage to do so when he goes off for a weekend of shooting at their cottage. But things go wrong when they return to the scene and find the body missing, or is it? The script by Olaf Pooley (who also plays the neighbor Reed) is so ambiguous, by the time the film's over, you don't know WHAT really happened. If it's an attempt to explain the decline into madness, Pooley isn't sharp enough to evince it. A real waste of time."
3,crucible of horror,was pretty good movie for the year it was made.good seller and in good condition.
5,michael gough is excellent and i like this film,"got this included with a 50 movie pack and is the first one.mg made a lot of movies to name one ""legend of hell house""with rody mcdowell might have mispelled his name. they use his likeness in that movie a very good ghost story with no holds bard."
3,Well written--but distant,"This is a book I want to love. The prose is precise and sometimes quite haunting. But it's hard to get fully immersed in the narrative. The author seems to be holding her readers at a distance--by giving us summary rather than scenes and reflection.That said, I am glad I read it. If you are a fan of Paula Fox, I think this is an important read. And if you are interested in memoir, again, this is a good book to spend time with."
1,Beautifully written - but didn't engage me,"""Born in the twenties to nomadic, bohemian parents, Paula Fox was left at birth in a Manhattan orphanage..."" What a range of people she had caring for her over her growing up years, what neglect at times, what an interesting range of geographic locations she lived in during her childhood. This ""memoir"" seemed to hold such promise, but really I found it a chore to read. A collection of memories, not always connected up, it never hooked me in, leaving me eager to find out what happened next. It also completely lacks any analysis - of the characters, events, Paula's reaction to them, the impact on her life, etc. Its main redeeming feature for me was its brevity - had it been longer, I may well have given up. Maybe if I was a fan of her novels (certainly her memoir is well written), or interested in other members of her family (apparently she is Courtney Love's grandmother), I would have been more motivated to enjoy rather than just tolerate this book."
2,so so,"Never got hooked on this book. Continued to read and finished the book because she is Courtney Love's grandmother and wanted some insight in that regard. I thought it was boring and all over the place. Best memoir I ever read is ""The Glass Castle."""
2,Confused......,"Although I have sympathy for Ms. Fox, I felt that I wanted to know more about her parents. For example, was she ever diagnosed as mentally ill or perhaps a personality disorder? She should have been locked up for her actions toward her daughter? I felt that Ms. Lock herself did not take what happened to her as a child seriuosly-she was quite abused and was treated in a manor not fit for a dog! The memoir seemed as if it were more fiction than anything-due to the writer's inability to write with any feeling about her life."
1,Convoluted writing style,Returned the book. Started to read the book but within the first cou0ple of pages couldn't get past the word-jams and author's long convoluted sentence structure.
4,Interesting what she leaves out,"She's Courtney Love's grandmother, Linda Carroll (famous therapist) is the child she gave up for adoption.Now her daughter Linda is going to write a bio of HER life where she mentions who her father is (at least that's the rumor), and supposedly Linda Carroll's father is none other than MARLON BRANDO!How's THAT for a bombshell that is missing from this book?"
4,Track listing of songs on the CD is in error.,"Many of the tracks suggested are not actually on this CD, i.e. ""Suppertime"", ""When the World Was Young"", ""In Spain they say Si Si"". Only 10 songs actually on this C.D. instead of the 12 advertised."
2,okay for a limited audience only,"This is a collection of academic essays on gay cultural products from Latin America, Latino America, and Spain. Unfortunately, the stodgy texts on ancient Spanish authors often drown out the cool articles about gay US Latinos. You may want to read it for the great essays about Reinaldo Arenas, especially given the success of the film about him. However, you are better off buying ""Eminent Maricones"" by Manrique or Cherrie Moraga's books."
3,A little too much!,"While I love James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, this much was just a little too much slap-stick comedy and FAST dialog. While I am glad I watched it, give me Yankee Doodle Dandy or The Public Enemy over it any day."
4,Haunting tale like only Lovecraft can bring!,"I don't really even know how to begin to describe this book. To some it may seem a little dry and long winded, but I found Lovecraft's description of the dilapidated town of Innsmouth to be captivating and he can somehow make things seem horrifying that don't really seem all that scary if you try to describe it to a friend. If you like a haunting story with a great deal of mystery and intrigue behind it, this is the book for you!"
1,Misleading Image,The image used for this book is the cover of the anthology of stories edited by Stephen Jones when in fact all that is offered is Lovecraft's story . This is misleading and I would not have purchased this had I know as I already have three or four copies of this tale in various collections.
2,I dont love it,I've been baking a lot more lately and thought it's time to really invest in some tools of the trade. I was sorely disappointed with the performance of this sifter. The holes are too wide. It doesn't sift well at all.
3,works fine,This machine works fine for sifting dry ingredients. Better than the smaller sifter also available. What else can I say?
3,good sifter,This product is exactly what it's supposed to be. It costs very little and gets the job done the old fashioned way.
2,Cheap phone,"This phone was cheap for an unlocked GSM phone and it showed. The user interface was now easy to use, features were very minimal, the audio quality from the phone was poor and hard to hear in noisy environments, ringer was hard to hear, etc. Oh, if you use an ear piece, your phone will not ring...only through the ear piece. :( Some good things about the phone? It is small, cheap, and it works to the best of its ability."
4,A Celebration of Great Music.,"I believe in leaving room for the best of the best, which is why I gave this CD a 4 instead of a 5. Having said that, the ninth track, ""Trouble in the Fields"" is so good it nearly brought me to tears, and for those who are ready to click on another link, this is NOT country music. A couple of the songs have a country flavor but this collection is largely non-country. Paul Hovda's piano playing is compelling and the recording itself is top-notch."
5,awsome game,this is one of the best medal of honor games ever and works on windows 7 very recomended to everyone
1,MOUSE LAG PERSISTS,"After installing the game I found it unplayable due to mouse lag. After hours of searching, all I could find about this issue is that is was noticed during demos and ""corrected"". EA support is worthless and says it has already been fixed and so there is no solution. I would not waste your time or money with this game."
4,I can't get it to run.,"i inserted the disk and added the 4 diget code, and it says preparing to install and then it just quits. i rated this so high because i played it at my friends houseHELP!"
2,Medal of Honor Airborne,"Not to sure on this game... I bought it thinking that My GForce 8800GTS Graphics card would be able to support this game. But I was wrong, you have to have a PhysX Graphics excellerator in order to run this game. I am not much of a computer Geek, but I think that the GForce GPU that I am using is way more than sufficient to run this game, more so than the PhysX GPE. A little disappointed..."
3,Nueva saga en MOHA,nos muestra ahora la dicision aerotransportada. con mejores graficos pero por momentos el juego se trona un poco lento. la ultima aprte si es muy buena.
3,Good Game on Drugs,"The Good:AI is excellent.Great graphics, especially the Physics Engine for the grenade blasts...you have to see these...AWESOME>I enjoyed jumping out of the planes and landing wherever i pleased.Great combat and general ""feel"" of the game.The Bad:The game gets extremely difficult at certain times. almost impossible.No save game. You have to wait for the ""check point"". this sucks when you have busted your a*s for an extended period and then get whacked at the last minute...start all over!You drive or pilot NO vehicles.The game DOES NOT realistically recreate WWII battles at all.The Ugly:The Super Nazis on the last 2 missions made me laugh. Where did they come from? So stupid. A disgrace to the original MOH.Overall, a fun game and I recommend it."
2,"Short, scripted and not much replay value","Could have been great. The visuals are very nice. The AI is pretty decent too. I completed the game on the hardest setting in 6 hours. There are only 6 levels. The multiplayer value has yet to be proven and with better games like COD 4 and another Halo, FEAR and Unreal coming...your money is definitely better spent else where."
1,Would Not Load,I probably would have liked it if I could have played it. Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor: Warfighter were terrific.
1,Didn't work!,"The user manual was missing; without the code printed on that, it is impossible to install and run the game."
2,Just a bit dissapointed,"Wow, thought they might get it right after Pacific Assault bombed...The multi-player was not ready for gameservers at the time of release, you cannot use symbols in your name, so if you are in a gaming clan, you will ticked off about that. The graphics are great, but you better have more than minimum hardware requirements to play the game and have any sort of fun with it. While we get the point that it is ""Airborne"" it shouldn't be necessary to Chute in every single darn time you get killed. (don't get killed, right ;)I do recommend the game. I have confidence that EA will meet the expectations of the gaming community and release the required amount of patches required to get it as good as they can; However, If your coming off MOHAA, you will probably end up going back to MOHAA as I did. It is nowhere near as personal as MOHAA. If they could only update MOHAA they would make millions...=[65th]=.:Rock:."
3,Okay WW2 FPS,"A lot of people seem to not like this and, while I can understand their points, I found this okay if a little frustrating a times.Basically you drop into the action taking a hard route or an easy one, then you go for your objectives via a variety of bad guys. Frustrations include a long time between checkpoint saves,the fact you have to keep parachuting in despite your checkpoint being on the ground, and the strange addition of hard to kill super-soldiers(?) near the end!On the plus side the graphics are lovely and it can be intense fun at times. My XP machine was top spec two years ago but managed to cope well, (apart from some occasional freezing) and still enjoyed this. Yep it could have been better but it is still an acceptable shooter that will entertain you for a few hours"
5,Medal of Honor Airborne,Medal of Honor Airborne is overall a very good wwII game. The graphics are excellent for 2007 if you turn the settings all the way up(everything on as high as it goes and screen resolution at least 1280 by 1024). The sound was made by recording actual wwII weapons and is great. The neat thing about the sound is that distance affects how loud the weapons sound(if an enemy is close to you the guns sounds loud and as he gets further away the gun sounds softer and softer). Some reviewers had trouble with the install crashing when it was almost done but I did not. I'm not saying you won't have trouble but I did not. I have one last point to make about the install. The game works on windows vista and xp service pack 2. Only service pack two for xp not service pack 3!
2,Can you hit me now? Good! oh....wait.,MoHA was so close to being good. A shoddy hit detection/shooting model really bring this title down. Also npcs move in an unreal tournament type fashion(instantaneus acceleration). If these two issues were polished then man this would have been a great game!
1,It just won't work.,"This game simply will not run on my machine. I more than meet the recomended system requirements, and I've tried just about everything I could find that might help. It still won't work. Three huge patches have been release for the game. But even with the patches the game still won't run anything more than the menu and the tutorial. I've given up on getting this game to run. EA support was useless. All they did was say that you had to meet the min. system req. and update your drivers (which I did).I gave the game 3 stars on fun level because I won't put down a game I can't play. It gets a 1 overall though because it simply won't work.(EA support gets -1 for being useless and making me sit for several hours to download and install over 5 gigs of patch info only to crush my hope when the game still wouldn't work.)"
1,A real disappointment,"Overall, I'm extremely disappointed in this game. After some odd ball installation issues (to which tech support was no use) I finally found a forum and some other players who'd figured out the fix themselves.I've attempted to play this thing for several days. I have a very robust gaming system and have tweaked, prodded, adjusted every available setting to get this thing to play well. No luck. Lots of lag, video delay, mouse delay, etc. After struggling through hours of this I finally quit, uninstalled it, and moved on to another game.Even if they offer to give you this game, stay away. It really stinks."
2,LAME,"Don't buy this game. You can't save except at checkpoints, so when you are killed, you have to play through almost the whole thing again just to get back to where you were. Even a head shot with an M1 Garand does not drop the enemy, COME ON!!!! The enemy soldiers have superhuman reflexes and can duck as soon as you pull the trigger. This game is boring and you feel like you are fighting with a pea shooter for all damage you can do to your enemy. First person shooters need to find another war to fight, (Korea would be cool) We have won World War Two too many times now."
4,Best Feat album since Feats Don't Fail Me Now,"Some great songs on this album and some new direction. This band will never go stale. Over Eden's Wall is one of the best songs they've ever written. Other notables - Ferocious Morning, Loco Motives & Calling The Children Home."
2,"Feat live still cookin', but new album not definitive.","Maybe I'm the only one, but I miss Craig Fuller's vocals. Perhaps dusting off the ""Last Record"", ""Feat's Don't Fail Me Now"", & ""Dixie Chicken"", reminded me what a singer/songwriter Lowell George was. This is still one of the greatest bands of all time, and recent live shows confirms that. ""Hoy,Hoy"" track is a welcome sound to us longtime Feat fans. Bill Payne is still the best. Hope for more"
4,good book for review,this is a good basic book if you forgot about your chemistry. it provides good examples to guide you.
4,Use it all the time,"I make a lot of presentations. This little unit stays with me no matter where I travel on business. The case makes it easy to keep the two components together when not in use and reduces the risk of loss or damage. Have not found a PC that did not work with it. Whenever some one else uses it, they want to know where they can get one.General use (page up/page down, and laser) are simple to use. But there is more that can be done, just not intuitive to figure out the more advanced features. But then again, not sure I need them!"
5,Exactely what I was looking for.,"I'm very pleased with this product, the proformance, the price, and the the service delivery time. Thank you and I'm looking forward to doing business with you again."
5,Works Very Well,"I make a lot of presentations for my job and wanted a more interesting way to present build slides while presenting. I had purchased one of those GYRO mice, but found it to be waaaaay too bulky to lug around. I stumbled across the Keyspan Remote Presentation remote and purchased it two year ago and it's worked flawlessly since day one. The product is lightweight, is a snap to set-up and the range is quite good - well worth the small investment."
1,It IS necessary to install software,"I purchased this specifically because it says on Amazon and on the package ""No software to install, just plug it in & it works within seconds."" But after cutting open the package I found that the instructions say that there is ""No software installation needed."" for Macintosh but for Windows you must ""install appropriate software."" Because my corporate-owned Windows PC is locked down I could not install the software so the remote will not work. Amazon's return policy says 100% refund for only unopened merchandise. Nice trick, I had to cut the package to get the truth about the requirement to install software. I'll make my case for a full refund but we'll see..."
4,Keyspan Presenter's Remote,The Keyspan Wireless Remote is a must for anyone who teaches or does presentations. It is easy to use and works well on a Mac or a PC. No additional software is needed. Plug it in and it is recognized by the computer. I highly recommend this product.
2,not as good as i expected,The product does not reach the distance it says on the package. that is why i bought this item. Will have to buy a better item.
2,laser failure,I've purchased two of these. The first time there were no other remotes with these features at the price. The laser failed after about a year. I bought a second one and the laser failed after about two months. Its awkward to turn the laser on to begin with. The scroll is very touchy and easy to advance a couple of slides instead of one.I see now there are other remotes available so I am going to try my luck elsewhere.
3,WOrks well.,"Works well. SOmetimes, it flakes out and i have to uninstall USB drivers, to get it to work again.ALso, have had problems with frequency connections. have to reset with paperclip.other minor problem: 40 ft range. That is the ideal. I see a lot less in a classroom with metal desks."
4,Works fine so far,"I just got this remote today. I plugged in the RF receiver to my laptop, opened up a powerpoint presentation and it worked! There was not much else to it. The instructions say that if you are a Windows user you need some kind of software and if you are a Mac user then you dont need the software but I think that might be the other way around because I am a windows user and I didnt need any software. I look forward to using it so that I can actually move around while I teach. Be careful... the switch that you use to advance forward is quite sensitive. I get the feeling I will accidentally moving forward more than one slide quite a bit."
2,Very flaky,I have had this remote for a couple of weeks and I've tried to use it in presentations twice. Both times it worked fine for a little while and then stopped working. I'm sending it back for a refund.
1,RE: It IS necessary to install software,"On a Powerbook G4 running OS X Tiger, the software is needed if you have any intention of using the remote's media functions. And good luck getting the software you need. The latest version of the presentation remote software is a corrupt file, and an older version of the software needed (that can be found only after some digging) will crash the machine and runs worse than if you ran the remote without the software. Ultimately, I just paid for a wireless mouse I can operate from my bed."
4,second one,"Bought first in 2003, second today. Great device. I talk for a living and have to have this. Considered others but scroll wheel makes it easy, fits my hand perfectly. Doubles as mouse. Could not be easier. Everyone that sees it wants one. Have to keep an extra battery handy though (or would be 5 stars)."
1,counterintuitive,"This clicker is counterintuitive. You need to roll a roller toward you to advance the slide, and away from you to back up. When pressing the button for the laser, it is too easy to move the roller on the side accidentally, unintentionally advancing slides. It is also inconvenient, and takes too long, to start the laser pointer, which also requires two hands. Who came up with this?"
2,Disappointing,"I had the Keyspan plugged into the back of my computer which is set up next to my entertainment center. I wanted to be able to control the mouse on my 46"" Samsung LCD screen from the couch, no more than 5-10 ft away, but it cannot even pick up a signal from that distance to the back of my tower. I had to buy a USB 2.0 extension cord to run it up the back and on top of my entertainment center where I thought for sure it should be able to pick up the signal with near lossless accuracy, but no joy. The signal is better with the extension, but is still sporatic a lot of the time. The media button is a plus though, which is the only reason for the 2 stars. My advice would be to go for a 2.4 ghz, which is why I just ordered a Hiro 4-in-1 2.4GHz Chrome WIFI Presenter, which I hope is far less disappointing."
4,I wouldn't train without it!,"This is my third Keyspan wireless remote. I wore out the first one and I replaced it with the newer model, then bought another of this model. I train professionally and wouldn't train without my Keyspan. (The same goes for my colleagues.) It works wonderfully well and the battery lasts a long time. It allows me to roam around the room (my training style) and run my presentation anywhere. Quite simply, it untethers me from my computer and allows me to focus on training/presenting--plus it makes me look good while I do it.p.s. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that the newer model has more features that I like, like volume control and blank screen. But I bought this one because I like the touch of the mouse better."
3,media mode does not work with Mac OS,"According to the manual (downloaded from Amazon), media mode does not work with Mac OS. This should be stated clearly in specifications as it says it works with Mac and says it has media mode, which implies media mode works with Mac."
2,Not user friendly,There are so few buttons on this thing. Who would have thunk you would need to keep the directions because the obvious buttons are not the ones you need to use to advance a slide on a PowerPoint presentation.I also still have no idea if it actually turns off or if I just have to take out the battery. You really get what you pay for here (very little).That is not to say it does not work. It works fine. It just has some major design flaws.
4,Batteries NOT included!!!,"This remote mouse is about the best on the market. Unfortunately, it takes a little practice to use it gracefully in front of an audience. The range of movement is great, I am a HS teacher and can easily walk around the room while presenting (30+ feet away from my laptop). Its small, light weight, powerful and the laser pointer pointer is very useful."
5,Wonderful!,"I have a computer in the bedroom for a tv so a mouse isn't ideal for use in bed and watching Netflix. This thing has been great and for the price it is a no brainer! The distance works anywhere in the room, and the battery has lasted years now too. Nice little wheel on the side from scrolling. It also has some sort of override mode that changes the function of all the buttons that I am sure does really cool things but I haven't really used that since it meets all my needs."
1,Worst clicker I've ever used,"This presentation remote is the bane of my existence. It presents a dizzying array of buttons, none of which you can click with confidence, knowing that you will advance to the next slide. Perhaps the designers of this remote thought of this as a feature: where will you go next? I've been embarrassed in front of large crowds, because the remote took me to the end of my slides, or wouldn't advance at all. In many, many presentations I've given up on the remote and just used the keyboard, since at least then I know what will happen.Anyone who gives this remote 5 stars has never used a decent remote."
2,Very limited value,"Worked sporadically, then the RF drive disappeared and it was useless. In our environment we have several people sharing a room and equipment. My staff give much higher ratings of the Kensington Presenter with Laser Pointer (Staples# Kensington - KMW33374) with the RF stores in the unit itself when not in use."
2,Worked Great & Then Stopped,"The presentation remote worked well. It provided good control of forward and backword motion for Powerpoint presentations. The RF technology did eliminate the need for line of sight operation. I really enjoyed using the product. Then one day, at the start of a presentation, it quit working. I assumed the battery had died, no one happened to have the special battery on hand, so I put it away.Later, I tracked down another battery for the device, put it in, and nothing happened. I checked voltage levels and the battery was fresh. So, I contacted Keyspan for warranty help. And after 3 weeks have not recieved any response.Hopefully, someday, they'll respond and fix the device. Without the service problems, I'd give the device a 4. With them, it seems your choice is to purchase and hope it doesn't break."
2,Not reliable enough,"I've given up using this product because it is just not consistent enough. It will work well for short periods, but then I have to click the button repeatedly for a slide to move forward. Sometimes only every third click will work, which is very annoying when you are standing in front of an audience and talking about what is about to appear. This has happened in several talks, so I doubt it is anything to do with RF fields in particular environments. Obviously, the product is not designed with a high-reliability wireless protocol.Other problems are the complex method for turning on the laser pointer, the rather low brightness of the laser pointer, and the non-standard choice of battery. Some things are very nice, such as the small travel size and weight and the fact that absolutely no setup is required (one of the only true plug-and-play products I've seen). Its too bad that this was taken to market without getting all the details right."
1,Great Device Poor Performance,"I first heard about this product from another instructor at the school that I work at. After trying it once, I immediately went out and bought it.I used it for one semester and experienced some of the same problems that others have; draining the battery in the carrying case and difficulty with the laser pointer. Now, after only one semester (16 weeks) the back button on the front and side is not working at all.I sent an e-mail to Keyspan, but have yet to hear a response. If this is the type of service and performance we can expect from them, then who is their competitor? My initial thought was to buy another one, but I don't want to give money to a company that isn't going to back up their product.I love the product and the idea, it was great when it worked, but I don't think that I will be buying any future Keyspan products because of the lack of customer support and the short life span of a workable product."
4,Fun PowerPoint Presentations,Easy to use. Much easier to control my presentations. I can keep my full attention on my students the whole time.
1,FRAGILE!,"The side button is not strong enough. I accidentally dropped this remote from a waist-height and the side button just broke off on impact, rendering the whole thing useless. Granted, I could reconfigure the other buttons to serve the same functions the side button performed, but the side button is INDISPENSABLE to reset the wireless signal in case of interference or when the battery is removed. It is unfortunate that I only got to use it for 3 days. I can still use the laser pointer though, but it is not worth it."
3,Roll and Rhyme Learning Elephant Toy,"I purchased this toy for my son as a gift and he really enjoyed it at first. He learned very quickly how to get the music to play, but he did tire of it very quickly. After about 2 weeks of playing with the toy, he now pushes it to the side."
4,Elephant and Lion BOTH excellent for 1 to 3 yr. olds,"These are great, and interact with the child. Teaches words, and occupies the child for long periods. Also teaches dexterity, etc. in spinning the tummy's wheel, etc. for younger children."
2,split even with proper care,"This board was highly recommended by Cooks Illustrated, which was why I bought it. It is nice looking, but split. I oiled it several times before using, and occasionally thereafter. I don't even own a dishwasher, and never soaked it. Even with all this, it split rather soon after getting it. The board also arrived with a rough, not fully finished-feeling surface. I now only use it for cutting bread. Eventually it will split in two length-wise."
1,In three easy pieces,"I also purchased this on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated. I read other reviews in which half were positive and the other half complained of warping and splitting. I went with the purchase, anyway, and it promptly warped, then began to split, and this weekend it came apart into three pieces. I can't even have a carpenter glue them back together because the warp makes it impossible for the pieces to fit against one another."
2,"great for cutting,but disappointing","love the board for cutting, but am very disappointed in its durability;I realize it's not an expensive board, however I did expect it to last longer that two months without splitting; I have handwashed it and oiled it according to the directions and it still split in two places; I guess you only get what you pay for;"
3,Split,Only after a few uses the ends split. I've been oiling it with their mineral oil but it's only helping for further splitting. Other than that I like the size and cushion for knife.
5,"clever iconds, handy size.","Meat and vegetable icons are winners.This is a very handy size,most often used in our kitchen."
5,A must read,"i can't rave about this book enough! Maurice Samuel is so eloquent in his discussion of Peretz that it is a pleasure to read his rendering of Peretz' stories. I have a much clearer understanding of Jewish transitions in response to the Enlightenment as well as a better and deeply satisfying entry into the variety and strangeness of Eastern European Jewish Tales. Samuel does a very lovely job of telling Peretz' stories and, then, when necessary, interjecting his own comments as the stories progress. It's worth it just to read Samuel's chapter on why it's so difficult to translate Yiddish."
2,HELLRAISER OR HELLPOSER?,"The first film is good. Not great, but good. Then theres Hellbound which is TERRIBLE. And then we get this one thats better then the first 2 but still laking in a lot of areas. First off is Terry Farrell's major OVERACTING and disregard for her character really puts a dent in the viewing process. She was sooo annoying I wanted to shut off the movie..But dident cause I love Pinhead. The second complaint of mine is Anthony Hickox laid-back directing which he put NO thought into whats-so-ever and the story has hardly anything to do with the first 2 films. Lets use a example of how a wicked scene is made rancidly terrible...""Demons are coming for me father""..""there are no demons child. Demons are a metaphore""...""then what the f*** is that?""....Bad, bad, bad. She could have said that wickedly but she just sucks. I swear, thank God the forth film was good. Cause this film will have to try harder next time."
3,good way better than the second,"much improved the best sequel done for the series. intersting plot, good gore, and special effects. but may not interest or apply to every horror fan. some elements can be ridiclous at times. but a good try for a better sequel"
2,Desicent,"this film is not that good. There is not that much of connection between this one and the first two. To much jokes from Pinhead and company. the plot isn't that well done, and the acting is not the best in the series by far."
3,THE ULTIMATE HELLRASER!!!,Barely escaping death from a more powerful demon at the gory end of HELLRAISER2 THE only surving cynobyte PINHEAD is trapped in a gothic statue but is freed by a not so wise young woman.Now pinhead is free to walk the earth realm to rip what ever flesh he desires and take whatever souls he desires.Also creating a new army of cynobytes to help him search and destroy for the one thing that will give him ultimate power the box.Now a young tv news woman must keep the box out of pinheads possesion guided by the good side of pinhead's soul.can she succeed? the world will never be the same after the wrath of all the evil powers of hell and darkness.
3,THE THIRD BRUTAL CHAPTER TO GOREY SERIES,THIS FILM WAS A HELL RAISER LIKE NO OTHER pinhead escapse emtrapment in a gothic statue into the earth realm to uleash his evil rath and it up to one heroin to stop this parade of evil...? watch and find out the ending tothis gory film
5,a SEQUAL WORTH WATCHING,"If you have seen any of the other hellraiser movies, tha you know that if you don't watch he'll ""Rip your soul""!, in this case watch the movieaction***** story***** gore*** unfortuattely not very goy total 13 stars"
2,One of the worst horror movies ever!,"I thought ""HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II"" was bad. But then comes along another sequel to give the series a bad name. Of course, there is plenty of gore to keep the average horror fan entertained, but the whole concept of what ""Hellraiser"" is supposed to be about has been lost. Even Pinhead has lost his touch as the ultimate prince of pain, I find him more funny than scary. So, overall it is just a complete waist of time and I think I'm being generous when I give it two stars. I'm waiting for another ""Hellraiser"" movie to give one star to."
3,Good for a few laughs!,"The third installment of the Hellraiser series is VERY bad. The Cenobites are what makes the Hellraiser movies so enjoyable...but they went very wrong in this sequel. I think one of the writers for this film must have previously worked at Mad Magazine. A Cenobite with a TV camera for an eye? One that throws CDs like ninja stars? How about the firebreathing Cenobite that uses a martini shaker as a molotov cocktail? Wow.In addition to ruining the cenobites, the acting is horrificcant. Yes, the acting is so bad that I just made up a word to describe it. This film really deserves a 2 star rating, but I bumped it up to 3 just because I got a few good laughs at the movie and, to its credit, there are a few good kill scenes. But I'd only recommend this film to the die hard Hellraiser fan."
4,Hellraiser III - finally on Region 1 DVD,"Finally, the only entry in the Hellraiser series not to have a proper DVD release, gets one!The DVD is widescreen(1.85:1),and is anamorphic. Runtime is listed at 93 minutes, and is rated R. The special features are announced as being:1. ""Clive Barker: The Art of Horror"" featurette2. 11 ""Extended""Scenes3. Theatrical TrailerEDIT: well, ahem, this review was wrong. ooops. there are no extended scenes at all, and the Unrated Cut(which runs a couple of minutes longer than this DVD)is not available. i guess it's back to the Unrated/Uncut VHS release of Hellraiser III. too bad i found out after purchasing the DVD. *sighs in frustration*"
1,Poorest of DVD quality,"I have seen this movie on VHS and it's one of the Hellraiser films that I enjoy. I liked the characters and the direction of the movie. When I watched this film on DVD last night, I was shocked at how poorly the DVD played. If the picture quality was like this on all DVDs, I'd still be watching VHS.The DVD has Lions Gate Home Entertainment on the label, but that must be a mistake. I wouldn't believe they'd release a DVD of this quality.A fun film to watch, but not on DVD. I hope they redo this DVD someday. I'd like to see it transfered properly"
5,Great Buy!!,"I have been looking for this movie everywhere, with out having to spend my life savings, and I found it through Amazon.com!!! This movie is no longer being sold in stores, and it was the only one of the series I didn't have, and everyone else wanted over $60 for it. This was a great find!"
3,It IS the R-rated version!,"To make it once and for all clear for all of you fans: This Paramount DVD features the R-rated cut of Hellraiser III.Since I still own the unrated Laserdisc version (which runs exactly 97 minutes), I was pretty much able to perfectly compare this DVD to the LD. And the DVD is definitely the R-rated cut. The advertised 93 minutes for this DVD-version are correct."
3,PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE SEQUELS,"THIS TIME, A CLUB OWNER BUYS A SCULPTURE THAT HAS THE FACE OF THE PINHEAD ON IT. SOON, PINHEAD BREAKS FREE FROM THE SCULPTURE AND GOES ON A RAMPAGE AND THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN STOP HIM IS A NEWS REPORTER WHO HOLDS THE BOX THAT CAN SEND HIM BACK TO HELL. WELL, THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST TWO, BUT THIS WAS AN OK SEQUEL AND THIS MAY BE THE BEST HELLRAISER SEQUEL OF THEM ALL. THE LAST 30 MINUTES OF THIS FILM IS INCREDIBLE."
3,And now for the let down...,"NO extended or deleted scenes. The film IS anamorphic widescreen, but it fails to mention it on the dvd case--it simply says it's ""letterboxed"". It's Dolby 2.0 sound with some rear speaker ambience. There's a ""Clive Barker The Art of Horror"" featurette that runs a half-hour and is an old, dated documentary.The picture looks better than on any of the previous bogus releases, but it hasn't been through any kind of restoration, so the print itself has plenty of wear and tear. Oh well. At least we can rejoice that it's an official widescreen release to include with the rest of the series on our shelves."
3,"Decent entry in the Hellraiser saga, which is getting a re-release in August.","Anyone looking to get this movie should know that a real RE-release of it is planned for August OF 2006, by Paramount Pictures. The re-relese will include a new Anamorphic widescreen transfer and Dolby 5.1 sound, along with a few extras.This is a decent entry in the Hellraiser saga, and the frist time that this particular chapter is getting a real release. I would suggest anyone wanting this move to wait untill August and by it from Amazon then."
2,Only buy to complete the series.,"The only reason I bought this DVD is to complete my Hellraiser DVD collection. Not that I don't like the movie, it's just that the DVD is pretty lame. First of all, this DVD is a special order from Canada. The cover dones a huge SPECIAL EDITION lable on the left side of the cover. Sadly to say, there is NOTHING special about this DVD. The movie itself isn't even in it's original theatrical ration (widescreen), which is a real bummer, and the picture itself is very gainy and not any better than the VHS edition. The only other feature it contains is chapter selection. Woopy (. . )! Every DVD has chapter selections; is this the feature that makes this DVD so SPECIAL! Again ONLY buy this DVD to complete your Hellraiser DVD collection. A real bummer compared to the special features on the Hellraiser 1 & 2 DVD's, but at least it's cheap."
3,It's about time they released this one in the States,"When I first saw this novie when it came out, I thought it was the weakest one in the trilogy. After seeing all the ones that came after it, (execpt for ""Deader""), and seeing this one again, I'd rate it 4 stars, but the DVD has no extras here except for the theatrical trailer, english subtitiles, and the featurette: ""Clive Barker, The Art of Horror"". No commentary, no deleted scenes, no bloopers, or other bells and whistles.Athough this DVD isn't just a glorified VHS copied to DVD, it should still have more. I'd rather pay more for something, than have a cheap barebones disc. AND I'M TIRED OF BUYING A MOVIE AND THEN A FEW MONTHS LATER HAVING THE DELUXE EDITION COME OUT!!!! (No wonder there's so much pirating going on, when they rip us off 2-3 maybe even 4 times for the ""EXTREME VERSION"")"
2,Not the worst in the series...,"First of all, I'd like to comment on the DVD. There are two dvds pictured in the description and they are both the exact same dvd with different artwork. I'm guessing someone decided it was a bit ridiculous to call it a ""Special Edition"", when there are NO extras on it. There really isn't anything ""special"" about the dvd. It has the movie. That's it. But it is hard to find so it's nice to be able to get for a decent price. The video quality is the same as a new vhs. Not bad but obviously not remastered or anything like that. I watched both ""versions"" on a big screen tv and they looked fine and sounded ok.As for the film... all I have to say is that a girl gets all of her skin ripped off, while she is screaming. And it's gross. YEAH!"
2,The weak point of the series,"THis movie is over all a horrid mess. Pinhead goes from a overwhelming Intimidating factor to a wisecracking Horror freak. There are some creative new Cenobites but thats it.the story revolves around a reporter who is trying to find out how this boy died. As it turns out he stole the Box and opened it. Pinhead himself is trapped in this statue that an art collector/ NIght club owner buys. After Pinhead is freed he kills everyone in the club, makes 4 new Cenobites (who die easily) and kills a priest just for good fun.This movie loses the flair that the past two entries held. Pinhead didn't massacre hundreads of people jus for the sheer enjoyment, he only came out when the box was opened and killed the person who opens it, plain and simple. THis movie oveall is garbage except for die hard collectors."
3,at least no.3 is available,wish it was widescreen or letterbox .It looked like they took it from a old video tape grainy like old low res video.hopefully they will re-release it from the original print in widescreen and add thx to the sound or DTS along with the extra footage.they might consider this an import just because of it being lions head a canadian company.all the video reviews look like they are for the same version so you can't tell what version they were revewing.The tech details don't say what company all the info comes from the reviews.mine is a 2001 release cat.no. 14556E region one.plot was ok but a little short.they need to release a box set after hellseeker.
1,I've gotta weigh in on this one...,"...because, truely, I found this one of the most maddeningly awful movies ever made. I've sat through worse movies, (second Crow movie anyone?) but what made this one so agitating, is the quality of the first two, just to follow into the lameness of this one.I don't mean to step on the toes of the people who enjoyed this one, but honestly, I don't even understand how this one could possibly be ranked over 1 & 2.1 and 2 had some really nice stories based around an interdimensional S & M cult. This one starts off interestingly enough, but spins off into a ridiculous straight ahead horror flick, with some ironic death/mutations on the characters (i'm not gonna explain that; i hate it when people ruin things for me; if you see the movie, you'll understand them; if you choose wisely to see something else, you'll do better to forget this mess altogether) that are just silly.This is simply a regrettable road for one of my favorite movie villains of all time."
2,"Stupid ""horror"" flick...","It's a horror sequel, so I'm being nice with the two-star rating. Horror sequels are rarely ever good and this is no exception. I honestly forget most of the plot, but I think it had something to do with Pinhead trying to get out of a concrete block and enlisting the help of a teenager. The gore is useless and vague, the dialogue makes little to no sense and the special effects leave much to be desired. The series only got worse with ""Bloodline,"" but the fifth is a real treat, as I've said hundreds of times before. ""Hellraiser 3"" just falls flat on the screen, dying in an embarrased blunder in front of the viewer. Somewhere, Clive Barker is angry."
4,Pinhead is back!!,"This one is not as good as pt. 2, but it stands good together with pt. 1. The one thing I don't like about the movie, is Terry Farrell. She doesn't fit in with the caracther. But as long as Pinhead is back as his evil self, what more can we demand. Since pt.2, all the other Cenobites are dead and gone, but Pinhead can just pick up someone else, can't he? I also think this have to be the film with the highest body count ever. The FX are real good, and brings the movie to a higher level. But they should have left it dead after this. It would make a nice trilogy!"
4,Pinhead Lives!,"Don't get me wrong, but as much a I liked this installment, I could'nt help feeling that this is the beginning of the end for Pinhead. He was just too talkative in this unlike in the previous films where he was dark and sinister and why is it just Pinhead who came back, where is female cenobite, butterball and chatterer?This was darkly humouress and had brilliant effects, but it did'nt have the same feel you got from the first 2 films, it lacked originality."
1,Pinhead Hits the Streets,"Pinhead gets released from his imprisonment in a rotating statue in a gothical night club. Once released he runs amok in the city killing everyone he comes across. Hopeless acting, hopeless plot, still lots of gore, still not satisfying to a fan of the series."
2,Pearls to Swine,"Like many horror films, and nearly all horror sequals, this was a bad movie with some very cool scenes. Buy it used, enjoy them, and lament what could have been."
1,rubbish!!!!!,"this is one of the worst films ever!its childish and full of silly ideas that no one could possibly find scary.is it just me or do the hellraisers just get more and more dumber?its a complete waste of money, but still buy it if you want to...."
1,This is the WORSE Hellraiser off the series!,"If you're buying this DVD to complete your set it's hardly worth it. The quality is poor(both sound and picture), there's nothing extra (it's not even letterbox), and it's just a ... movie. Look or wait for something better. ... As a Barker fan for years the first two movies are the only true Hellraisers in which Clive Barker had the most to do with and isn't embarrssed about. The first is a classic and the second was a special efx showcase. Hellraisers 4 through 6 are much better then 3. The cenobites are ridiculous and the plot [was unacceptable]. Oh, by the way, I've met Doug Bradley (Pinhead himself), and he personally said he thought 3 was far from the best as well, case closed."
1,"Decent Film, Horrendous DVD","Stay away from his cheap videocassette copy. That's right, this is a plain Video Cassette copied onto a DVD, it looks [bad] and the sound is garbage. A new, cheap ... copy is coming... It's gotta be better than this garbage."
2,NOT TOO GOOD,THE ACTING IN THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST IVE EVER SEEN IN A LONG TIME.IT GETS KINDA COOL IN ABOUT AN HOUR INTO THE MOVIE
2,An Okay Sequel,"There is a lot about the movie that I just don't really care for. The characters being probably the biggest problem of Hell On Earth. Terry Farrell was annoying as the lead and the slime ball club owner who you are supposed to hate just wasn't that interesting. If anything, he was just as annoying as Terry. The story itself isn't that memorable either. Out of the four theatrical Hellraiser movies, this is my least favorite."
3,"good Soundtrack, boring film.","This film is so far the lesser of the HELLRAISER films, but the soundtrack CD for this film is not bad. I like the music track for HELLBOUND the mote. i think that one is the best one."
1,absolutely the worst Hellraiser movie...,"now Pinhead delivers one liners? Cenobites weren't that easy to make (nor were they made on Earth) in Hellbound...let's play a game called ""erase everything from the first 2 movies!"" leave this one alone. don't even rent it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I love Hellraiser 3 but this new release is just horrible. I am so glad that they re-release Hellrasier 3. But this DVD is so bad. The movie is so fuzzy, and it is full-screen pan and scan. The last out-of-print edition from Paramount is widescreen and sharp picture, and has a very nice menu with English subtitle and 2 special features. This new edition has nothing at all. Just play and chapter selection.Very disappointed. Do not buy even if you love Hellraiser and it is only 5 bucks."
4,Hellraiser 3 Is Cool!,"Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth is really cool! The action scenes are cool, the special effects are very good, and even some of the laugh lines are funny (""Your soul is ripe for suffering, Joey. It's harvest time.). The only problem with it is that some things aren't explained very well (like how Captain Spenser has ""power"" in Limbo). All in all, Hellraiser 3 is a masterpiece of psychological horror."
1,this is where the series started its downfall,"to me this is where the hellraiser series turned more into an average horror series. first off why did they give pinhead emotions, i like the way he was in the first two where hed just stand there and say ""no tears please, its a waist of good suffering!""now in this one they decided to make him happy and make him laugh and make him buy his victims ice cream. to me the second one was the best, the imagry was unbelievable. but after that clive barker lost most of the control and peter atkins stepped in and ruined it by making a happy pinhead, cheesey cenobites, and a lousey, unimaginative story. dont buy it."
4,Good story- nice tricks- great actress!!!!,"This movie was clearly made for money, not because of any other reason- but it is pure fun. The effects are good enough to keep the story rolling, and the story itself is not like a Barker- story, but it works... The truly best about this movie is clearly- Terry Farrell, Ex- DS9, now Becker. Her Joey is unlike other women in horror movies- she`s strong, independent and clever! All thumbs up for Hellraiser III- and her!"
4,Hell of a Movie,"Hellraiser 3 may not be a award-winning movie but it's a good horror movie.I'm so glad it's being released on DVD. I don't even care if it has no special features or it isn't uncut. I just want it with good picture and sound ,After what I heard about the Top Media relaese of it. If you want to see the Hellraiser movies that are all linked together see 1-4."
5,A classic for the Classical standard,"My main composition professor at university was (and still is) a stickler for good, precise, consistent, and clear notation. He should know; besides his own scores (beautifully done, even though filled with many difficult and novel notations), he's also worked on the side for the last thirty years making clean beautiful copies of scores and parts for others. This book was what he insisted we all learn from, and is still considered as his own primary reference today. There aren't many questions of standard usage it doesn't cover (both current and historical), and it distills many of the more unusual indications that began to be used in contemporary music. Each composer will find their own usage and innovation, but thorough study of this book will ensure that a real, solid foundation of the fundamentals of notational clarity will be at their command for whatever they want to do."
2,Look elsewhere first,"Certainly one is entitled to praise this book if one feels it warrants praise. It is rather much, however, to call everyone who feels otherwise unserious and ungrounded. Well, this book is more extensive than most music notation books, and that is worth something. On the other hand, 1) it misunderstands rhythm--as the grounded and serious and often performed composer Paul Creston points out (much more often performed, by the way, than the author of this book) and 2) for most ""extended techniques"" there generally is no standard notation, as a glance at ""New Music Vocabulary"" by Howard Risatti will demonstrate.The supercilious composition student (or soi-disant ""serious, grounded composer"") can learn much about rhythmic notation from Paul Creston's ""Principles of Rhythm"", yet I recommend Paul Creston's ""Principles of Rhythm"" for all musicians of all temperaments. (I don't recommend his ""Rational Metric Notation"", by the way--another story.)"
1,deficient,"A reference book such as this--in contradistinction to an original music-theory exposition such as ""The Lydian-Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization"" by George Russell (or, for that matter, ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz-Rock Keyboardist"" by Jeff Burns)--, is made up of received matter--by its very nature. Especially where that matter is widely available elsewhere, as in this case, it is appropriate to judge such a book by its manner of presentation. I find ""Music Notation""'s manner of presentation deficient. It is difficult to use and difficult to trust, and its style is obtrusive and annoying. Again, although music-notation reference books tend to come and go, there are many alternatives to this book still available. I agree that one of the best is ""The Norton Manual of Music Notation"" by George Heussenstamm."
1,bloated and inaccurate,"Paul Creston in his authoritative ""Rational Metric Notation"" points out several of Garner Read's errors. Here is one:1) ""Chapter 10 of Gardner Read's book 'Music Notation', entitled 'Meter and Time Signatures,' begins: 'TIME, METER, TEMPO, RHYTHM--musicians often use these terms imprecisely. But the four expression are not synonymous, and only two are interchangeable. The analogous terms are TIME and METER...' The first sentence and the first phrase of the second sentence state a truism; the remainder of the statement vitiates the truth.""The more than two dozen dictionary definitions of TIME can be condensed into one synonym, DURATION, which is present in every definiton of TIME. The word METER is derived from the Greek METRON, the Latin METRUM, and the French METRE; in ANY language, it means MEASURE. In music, therefore, TIME means DURATION, and METER means MEASUREMENT OF DURATION. Hence, TIME and METER are NOT analogous or interchangeable."""
3,Helpful for VERY local concerns,"All in all I was disappointed with this book - it was helpful for VERY local concerns, as to where one might find a launderette, but it was, as another reviewer said, skimpy and a bit too fascinated with the ""trendy"". This book rarely takes you off the beaten path...and in Ireland, off the beaten path is the way to go! I bought 5 books for my Ireland vacation and this one I left behind in the glove compartment of the rental car - maybe the next renter will find it helpful! :-)"
5,Traveling In Ireland 101,"This book was the handbook that my son and I used to travel all over Ireland. We did everything we wanted to do with little confusion and fuss. We had backpacks and used this guide to easily find trains, busses, awesome B&B's, great restraunts, tours, etc.... But it was also helpful in understanding how to be a good ""guest"" in a foreign country. Outstanding!!!"
3,Read it.,I read it before going to Ireland. I don't think the book was what I was really looking for. I do love Rick Steves tv show and thought the book would be better.
5,I heart Rick Steves,"Rick's Ireland book is well organized by region and focuses on inexpensive travel that helps you see the sites but get in touch with the locals. I love that he provides his own walking tours of major sites to save you some money on paying for a guided tour that would only recite the information that Rick has already provided. I reccomend this book for anyone traveling to Ireland, and any Rick Steves book in general to anyone interested in European travel."
2,wimpiest ding,"Really cute but the wimpiest ding you ever ""didn't hear"". Bought this for a gift. At least it was cute and brought a big laugh when the little, tiny ding came."
4,Electric Shocks,"This was a brilliant album by Roger Ruskin Spear, and in the same way Fawlty Towers is more consistently funny than Monty Python, so it is with this album compared to those of the Bonzo Dog Band, of which Roger was a part. Every song is a classic."
2,Poor quality,This draw plate was manufactured with poor quality. Mine came to me with a large crack in the metal along it's primary surface.
1,Absolutely horrible,"I concur with the previous reviewer. This GPS is a piece of junk. I received it as a gift for my birthday, and it never worked right. Only about once in 50 tries does the Palm recognize the GPS, and even then, it ""disappears"" after about 5 minutes. I even did a hard reset on my Palm Treo 700w and installed only the Street Atlas Handheld software and the GPS driver and that didn't work.Bottom line is this: If you're trying to get this device to work with your Treo 700w, forget it and look for a GPS that's (a) better built, (b) has better drivers, and (c) actually has a tech support dept that cares.Amazon really *does* need a 0 rating --- especially for this product."
1,Doesn't work at all!!,"Where's the zero star...? I bought this to use with my new Palm Treo 700w with CoPilot Live 6 software. After uninstalling, and playing with the thing for way to long I have come to the conclusion that the thing just doesn't work. The SD card is very slow at accessing the information placed on it. Can't even run the GPS software from it! I can't even get a signal...The website doesn't have any troubleshooting and the CD it came with has no info what so ever! Guess I'm going bluetooth for a GPS reciever, save yourself lots of time and aggrevation and DO NOT get this product!"
4,Works Excellent - No relevant documentation,"Make sure to enable LPR byte count when setting this up in windows. Without this, the windows spooler goes nuts.Printing directly to the printer is an option, to bypass the windows spooler all together, but is extremely slow.Lots of trouble getting this to work, but once I enabled LPR byte counting on windows, this thing works like a dream.It will not share your multifunction printer devices, though it will share the printer portion of such a device (no scanner or fax server - just print server)."
3,"Good enough for most, except HP, printers","The unit was relatively easy to easy to install for me. I am technically competent to a fair extent. I was disappointed that it could not connect with a 3 year old model, HP Officejet AIO printer. HP seems to insist that I use HP's own product, Jetdirect unit costing twice as much! :("
1,Utter garbage,"I've installed a lot of print servers in the past, mostly HP JetDirects. They all just work. This, on the other hand, is utter garbage. It is ridiculously difficult to set up, it crashes all the time, and never prints anything right -- on my laser printers and ink jets both, every printout comes out off-center or even running off the edge of the page. Avoid, avoid, avoid. I didn't even bother returning it for a return, I threw it straight into the e-waste bin. Yeah, it's cheap, but save yourself the time and trouble -- this thing is nothing but abandoned orphanware (hasn't even had a firmware update for years, and doesn't even mention Vista or MacOS 10.4 or above in its FAQ or online knowledge base!) that D-Link continues to sell only because they have a warehouse full of the things that they need to get rid of before they can ""officially"" discontinue it."
3,"Works, but setup was a little cumbersome because of its IP address of 192.168.0.10. wireless router gets disconnected","The setup instructions are good. However, you have to first connect to its default IP address of 192.168.0.10 -- which can be a pain because most default routers are on 192.168.1.xChanging the 1 to a 0 is theoretically fine, but you will lose connectivity in the middle several times.I just bought the print server, so my experience is only for a few hours. It's working for me currently. However, I'm noticing that my laptop is losing its wireless connectivity frequently. Not sure if the print-server is the cause. However, it has never happened in the last several years that I've been using this wireless router and laptop."
2,Too much trouble,"After several hours of trying it finally works. You must have an XP machine, it won't load on Vista. Lots of problems with printer driver on the machine that had the printer on it! Looks easy, it's not!"
5,Great wired print server that is USB 2.0 compliant.,"Reconfiguring my home office, I needed this to serve my Epson Photo R2400 printer which is now across the room from my desk. The installation went flawlessly. Just carefully read the instructions step-by-step. They are well illustrated and straightforward. I looked at other home network wired print servers, almost buying one of them because it was also a small hub. Reading the fine print, which was buried in the tech specifications, I found that the others were only USB 1.1 compliant, not fast enough for my USB 2.0 Epson R2400."
2,Not easy to set-up,"I'm pretty advanced with computers, but I could never get this print server to work right. It wouldn't work when I tried to print through the network -- only when I was attached directly to the print server. The setup was just too long and had some complicated steps that didn't make much sense. I'm sure if I called technical support it would have eventually worked.So I finally went out and bought the Netgear WGPS606 -- a wireless print server that costs a little more. But it was worth it. The entire setup was automatic and I was up and running on two computers within minutes. That's the way it should be."
1,Didn't Work,"I have lots of experience with computers and networking, but could not get this print server to work. Tech support finally told me it wasn't compatible with my printer. I finally got my printer networked by installing the driver on my Windows Home Server (WHS) and connecting the printer, via USB, to it. I had read that it's best not to install software and drivers on the WHS, which is why I ordered this print server. Then, I figured that since WHS is based on Server 2003, it shouldn't hurt anything. No problems after 2 + months. Another option is to connect your printer to a computer, share it, and leave that computer on when you may be printing. A lot cheaper, more reliable, and fewer headaches."
2,Where Did My Doc Go?,Easy setup but the little beast is really slow. Some print requests never were completed.Terry
1,Will only print to postscript printers on Mac OS X,"Sounds like a great product, but the manual clearly states that printing is OS X requires postscript compatible printers. My inkjet is not postscript, so I have to return this. I wish this had been clearly written before I purchased."
3,Not compatible,The above listed item does not work with multi-function print-scan-copy-fax devices. So I returned it for credit. This was not known to me when I ordered it.
1,Does not work with a multi-function printer,Check this site to see if it is compatible:http://support.dlink.com/faq/view.asp?prod_id=1263&question;=DP-300U%20/%20DP-311U%20/%20DP-301U%20/%20DI-704UP%20/%20DI-824VUP%20/%20DP-311U_revB
1,"There is two dp-301U models, not one","Reviews are very different on this item. It is because there are two very different models of it. The old one, in the bottom marked ""HW Ver: Ax"" is the old really bad thing. It came with firmware up to 1.1, and can not be upgraded to version 2 or 2.1. This is becaused the firmware 2 and 2.1 is for ""HW Ver: Bx"" and is about 4 times as big as the firmware for the older model. The model ""B"" contains all the menues that was removed from the web interface of the old model, and works a lot better (still having some problems, but not close to the problems of the old model). The old model is more or less worthless. It is strange the difference in models is never pointed out when having contact with D-link.--- Mats ---"
5,Another great Hairy Maclary book,"Great rhymes, wonderful words (""bumptious and bustly""...) and a fun, simple tale. A real favouite of my two year old. Another great children's book from a superb author. Highly recommended."
5,Awesome Book,"My 3 year old daughter loves this series, with repetitive words that make it easy for her to remember the story for when she is reading to herself. Characters from previous books can make a appearance, which I find nice as it links all the stories to each other.We brought this one, to add more Hairy Maclary Stories to our little collection that we have, and have not been disappointment."
3,sd normal...,"adquiri esta sd para ser utilizada con una camara kodak z812 is,pensando que utilizar una sd de la propia marca ayudaria a mejorar el desempeño de compresion de una toma;sin embargo el tiempo de proceso es igual a una sd estandart e inclusive un poco menor que una panasonic 1gb que tambien he utilizado regularmente.sin embargo,cumple su trabajo como la mayoria de las sd comerciales hoy dia,en ningun momento se menciono que tuviese ningun performance especial. espero que mi reseña les oriente a tomar una mejor decision. saludos."
5,better than season 1!,one of the few comedies on television that is laugh-out-loud funny and truly smart at the same time. the second season surpasses the first in that it is less scattered and the each of the characters' stories begin to build and acts in parallel to the crime-of-the-week.
1,is it possible to give less than one star...?,"... because that is what this album is worth. i would get rid of it, but i haven't yet found anyone tone-deaf enough to be willing to take it off my hands."
4,AN EARLY SET FROM A SCOTTISH MASTER,"This early album by Dick Gaughan contains some of his best work, and is a nice mixture of his self-penned political songs and more traditional selections, including works by Robert Burns as well as songs dealing with the work and plight of coal miners, a cause near and dear to his heart (He released an entire album of mining-related songs to benefit the miners strike in the UK during the Thatcher years). Gaughan is (as usual) in fine voice here, and his guitar work shines nicely as well. 'Bonnie Jeannie o' Bethelnie' is a classic example of the sheer beauty of traditional Scots song. This album is a classic of the Scottish folk revival -- it's nice to know that it's still available. Those who are interested should also seek out his 'Handful of earth' album -- that and 'A different kind of love song' are must-haves for anyone who enjoys his work."
3,Gaughan - Dick Gaughan,This is a pretty good Gaughan album. I would recomend this to anyone who is into old Scottish and North of England folks songs. His dialect is pretty strong so I imagine anyone from North America could have trouble understanding what he's talking about. There are some pretty interesting tales in here so its worth perservering. If you havent heard Dick Gaughan before I would recommend you buy Handful of Earth first.
3,There's a better instructional dvd out there...,"This is mostly entertaining and demonstrative, but not really instructional. Although Mel is obviously an accomplished caster, his ability to teach does not come across on DVD as well as it probably does in person. Too much of this DVD is given over to wand-waving antics with superficial coverage of technique. He does not focus on such things as the importance of the wrist and forearm, arm position and angle, etc. I do not find the exaggerated antics of his alter ego, Joe Schmokopo (or whatever his name is) to be helpful at all, and it wastes valuable video time. Plus my copy skipped or omitted several chapters. I find Joan Wulff's DVD to be much more thorough and serious, with a tone that is much more consonant with the sport. Or, to put it another way, nothing personal, Mel, but I would rather fish with Joan than with you."
1,OUCH!!!!,"I wish someone at Amazon would have kissed me first just to get me a little excited first! this guitar is untunable all six strings buzz out from the nut to the 12th fret it was supposed to include a digital tuner I didn't get one the amp does nothing but buzz (Oh wait that's the distortion, huh? THAT'S THE DISTORTION?) stay as far away from this one as possible I'd return it but I can't afford to ship it back I don't have the cash so I'm stuck with it! I repeat do not buy this guitar pack from anyone!"
4,Great value...,This guitar set was bought for my son. I'm impressed with the quality of the item. I'm not a musician but friends who play and have seen it think is pretty good for a beginner. Decent sounding amplifier. I would recommend you to get headphones!!! And get a different gig bag (very poor the one included) and cord.
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"We tried TWO of these! The first one arrived damaged, but it was clear from the packaging that it was already damaged when it was packaged to be sent to us. The second one had a bent neck; so badly arced that the music store said that it was ""unplayable""! Both of them cruddy. Amazon made good on their guarantee and we are getting a refund and were able to return both at no cost, but what a mess; it was a Christmas gift. Stay FAR AWAY from this manufacturer!"
2,Great book if you can read it,"The author knows the subject well; two problems: - I cannot read it without a magnifying glass (and it is not my eyes; I am a commercial pilot and pass a physical every year) the use of point 6 type and smaller in screen shots makes an otherwise good book unreadable.- the instructions are for computer illiterates: ie page 113:""1. Type for2. Type {3. Type $i=14. Type ; ""Come on, anybody buying a book of that nature deserves better.Otherwise I would have given the book a 4 stars rating."
4,Good Introduction to Perl for CGI Programming,"If you want to add dynamic content to a web site and you're not a programmer then this book will give you a good introduction to writing CGI programs in Perl.It's one of a very small number of beginners books which cover important features like the CGI.pm module and ""use strict"". It even has a chapter about security which many books ignore completely.This book won't make you a Perl expert - but it will help you take the first steps. And it will give you a good foundation should you decide to become an expert later on."
2,"A somewhat general guide, not a tutorial or a step-by-step","If you're seeking to learn how to write scripts, this isn't the book that will teach you. It is a guide only to basically understand Perl and CGI (what certain groups of characters mean, how it basically works). It is a beginner's book, but learn html before you buy it. Early in the book Castro uses terms (w/o any explanations) that only someone familiar with code might understand. The more you know html before reading this book, the better.Even after reading it, you still won't be able to write a script on your own. You should be able to use others' scripts though. Although there is no CGI/Perl reference/glossary in the book, it is well-organized and most of the language is simple and easy to understand for the average reader. However, if your vocabularly is a little weak, keep a dictionary on hand. The book is certainly something you should have in your library, but don't be misled as to what it provides."
2,Disappointing,"After Purchasing Elizabeth Castro's HTML book I figured her PERL book would be a sure thing. It is marketed as a 'first programming book, and is tailored at perl for the web---A great concept. ""For the essence of space"" she has left out details, writes Castro. Unfortunately, I am discovering that I am unable to make the leap of faith she assumes to produce results. I think the book has value for learning how to set-up scripts, but you had better look for a second book as a strong reference on the actual perl.If her book had full-blown examples of the concepts reduced for space in the book, I think the book would be more complete.I hope the 2nd revision made marketed improvements. It was unavailable on the prjected release date in the Netherlands."
2,I'm up to chapter 14....,"and the majority of her scripts don't work on my host's unix server....I called the sys admin, who looked the scripts over and said they wouldn't run unless some changes were made. Mz. Castro fails to mention this in her book. Even downloading the scripts directly from her site didn't work. I get the feeling this book was written with the Mac in mind. Her HTML book was great, but she really bombed on this one. I think she should read UNIX in a Nutshell to get a feel for servers that run unix."
1,The worst,"This book is one the worst computer book I ever read. It states that it teaches ""the easy way"" to me it was more like the sensless way, This book is 200+ pages of confusion leading up to download other peoples perl scripts from the internet. If you want a good book on perl consider one written by Ed Tittle, his explainations make sense plus he holds practically every certification available."
1,Very Poor,"Apparently, Liz had wasted a lot of her precious time copying and pasting those nice, colorful screen shots into that book.I'm sorry to say it is very shallow and instead of concentrating on the core of Perl as a stand-alone scripting language, she paid extra attention to the thing that she knows better, HTML. She also didn't forget to incorporate very obvious ads about her other HTML title in almost every chapter.At last, I have to say she is very brave. She wrote a whole book on HTML and in her second one on Perl, she admitted that she just knew the usage of the HTML <BASE> tag."
1,Pictures of Words doesn't count,"I'm a beginning Webmaster and I was naive enough to buy this book thinking it would be a simple guide I could follow. For anyone out there that is like me(20,Beginner in Web Design and Perl) this is not the book for you! On the cover it claims it, ""...uses pictures rather than lenghty explanations"" WRONG, Pictures of Words do NOT count as pictures. If someone is only using this book they are limited to its examples of doing things. Remember that before buying it. This book allows for no customibility on YOUR site."
3,"Decent, but not great","I purchased this book solely on the name of the author, whose HTML book I found immensely helpful. This one was good, but not exactly what I needed. Some of the examples were hard to follow and they didn't all work on my server, even when I typed them (I thought) verbatim. Overall, it's not a bad book and it does do a decent job of teaching CGI scripting, but it wasn't complete enough for my needs; I had to buy another book before I felt comfortable with writing even basic scripts on my own."
2,"The Content is good, but the lay out is too bad","There are too many reference like ""you can do this, see page 57""; ""for details on running this, see Chapter 3"". About 4-6 per page. and when you go to that page, you got more references, it won't go to an end, Then you geting lost, forgeting what you want, where you were and became mad.The content is fine though. I have to ask my frind if I got question. Then usually I found that there IS an answer in the book, but the lay-out makes it too hard to get it."
5,"I have not read much about it, so can not have a good and a good review yet. May be later","I have not read much about it, so can not have a good and a good review yet. May be later"
1,Wrong Edition,I thought I had made a mistake and ordered the wrong book. Now I see that I had originally ordered the 2nd Edition and received the 1st Edition. It has made it extremely hard to learn using Perl and building CGIs. I'm not a happy camper.
2,Way too many errors.,"The diagrams are great. The book is easy to understand. However, it is riddled with errors wich are (still) not corrected in the latest printing. I find that unprofessional. This book should have delt with the CGI.PM module also."
1,Don't buy this book.,"The book purports to be a visual quickstart guide. However, you will need a microscope to view the examples; which after close examination, you will find to be the same examples you can get for free on-line. The extensive use of deprecated code is more than just annoying, especially the code that was deprecated prior to publishing. The publishers should have caught that. Get the O'Reilly book instead: the one with the mouse on the cover."
1,My dog would've liked this,"I needed this book like I needed a bad case of hemmrhoids (excuse the spelling.) This book is a joke, and that's aside from the fact that Castro teaches Perl on a Mac (because she doesn't know anything else.) This book had lots of nice pictures which made me feel good about myself inside, however it didn't teach anything. Get a book by the people who wrote Perl (read Learning Perl, Programming Perl and the Perl Cookbook in that order) and accompany that with a unix tutorial (i recommend Unix Complete.) I also strongly urge you to take this book down to your local petstore, because dog's need books too."
4,essential dictionary,"This is an excellent index of scripts that are often used on the WWW. As all Peachpit publications, it lives up to the fast paced times in which we currently live. I use it quite often, more or less like a dictionary. If you would like to understand the actual workings of Perl, this book is not for you. I then recommend ""Learning Perl"" by O'Reilly Press.But as a indexical no nonsense reference, this book is essential for the novice."
2,"Not worth the money, even free.",As a book rated for beginners and the intermediate I found this book to be rather wordy with the use of bad examples thoughout.I am a beginner at PERL and CGI and I found this book hard to swallow for my first real attempt at grasping how to make my web deisgns better.I would recommend O'Rielly who would be nortorious for in-depth over the head by most.
3,Not well worked out,It's a good book for beginers but they did not finished all of the details. They jump from one place to another. Don't really finish explaining the topic.
2,Not my style,"I found both the layout and the text of this book difficult to learn from. With its small visual chunks, my eyes had to jump around the page excessively in order to take in the information presented. The font size and colors didn't help readability.Also, it seemed like important points were glossed over while trivial details were belabored. For example, I couldn't find explanations of some of the perl syntax used in examples, yet anchor tags were explained step by step, where the first step was to 'type an opening angle bracket <', then 'type a href= ' ...and so on. This just seemed absurd to me, but I guess some readers aren't bothered by the uneven levels of coverage.I have since switched to ""Learning Perl"" by Randal Schwartz and ""CGI 101"" by Jacqueline Hamilton, and am much happier with these books."
2,Not for programmers....,"I bought this book as a reference to learn how to start programming in Perl & CGI - but have just found this book ill written and simply hard to follow. Other books in this set, such as PHP and MySQL, are wonderful resources - but this one just isn't. Not to mention I still havn't found the downloadable scripts that the book advertises. I am going to pitch this book when I get a better reference."
4,Decent resource for beginners,"I got this as a resource to learn a bit about CGI and Perl. I have done some very minor editing and setting up already made scripts, but I wanted to be able to do more.The book is not as detailed in some areas as I would like, and some very simple, basic details are left out.However, overall, the book as a resource, is useful and helpful and I do recommend it for that purpose. I also like the examples and pics of how the code is used."
3,"Not bad, but a little too simple...","The problem I found with this book was it's simplicity. It was easy to follow but it spent a lot of time on the basics of cgi/perl, and unfortunately didn't crossover into deeper waters. If you want to learn to make a guestbook, poll, or any other half-decent script, don't bother with this book. If you need the basics of cgi/perl it's a great place to start."
4,Ignore the Moron from Seattle,"I had been using databases for about two years, HTML for one year, and programming in a Unix environment for a living for just six months when I bought this book. I read it practically cover to cover, and was writing CGI programs immediately. If you have less experience than me, it might be a bit harder, but still very accessible. With more experience, but not with Perl/CGI, this book will be an excellent starter. The only way I don't see it being very useful is if you're already an experienced Perl/CGI programmer. It's biggest downfall is that the coding examples aren't really all that practical. You will definitely need a more advanced book to start writing robust CGI applications, but at ANY price, not just this book's comparatively low price, this book is definitely worth the money if you want to get a good basic grasp of this topic"
2,Two Days,"I've had this scoop for 2 days, and it's already showing signs that the handle might snap off. The handle is attached to the scoop in a very weak bond. Other reviewers have suggested just ""choking up"" on the handle, but that hasn't been enough for me.It needs to be stronger, plain and simple. The way it is now, it's not worth the dough."
3,"great design, but does it have to be this big??","i was attracted to the scoop's wire grid design, but when I received it, I was surprised how huge it was.I use corn litter, so the litter is light, and I don't have the problem with the scoop handle breaking, like a lot of the reviews do here.But I do not have a jumbo litter pan, and the scoop is simply too big to maneuver around in the pan, a lot of the times the scoop hits the panside, and the dirty clump falls back into the box. Quite frustrating. Unless you have a jumbo pan, otherwise don't bother getting this scoop."
3,Potential wasted,I liked this scoop. Really. Until the plastic handle promptly cracked. The only thing holding it together is the rubber cushion. Evidently it doesn't do well with sifting full loads. Right now I'm just waiting to see how much use I can get out of it until the rubber gives way as well. A metal handle would have created a sturdier product.
2,The best I've found,"Using the usual hard plastic scoops found in the local store was difficult. The back where I gripped the handle was sharp and dug into my hand while I sifted through the litter. THIS litter scoop is well padded so one does not get any sharp or deep pressure when sifting through the sometimes-heavy litter. It has 2 screens so the smaller bits that fall through the usual scoops is caught and can be disposed of. However, after only about 4 months, the front started coming apart, where I dig into the litter opening up so that litter bits get stuck, thus widening it further. If you choose this product, scoop from the side, then it will last longer.However, I've now found the best litter scooper ever, the Litter-Lifter which is easy to use, light, durable and gets all the bits from the pan, small and large, it handles them all well. This one has wedge-shaped tines that do catch all the clumps better than any other. Too bad it's not yet on Amazon, I hope to see it here in future!"
3,"Big, but why give all that room for litter when it can't lift it w/o breaking!","I was so excited that the scooper was so big and it looked like it wouldn't make my hand ache either (I have a bad wrist), so I got a big scoop of litter the first time I used it, and I heard a snap.Welp.. the first time I used it, I cracked the handle all the way up. I have kittens, so it's not like their litter is extra heavy, but if you fill the scoop up with solid (dirty) kitty litter, it can't handle the weight. I'm very disappointed. I'm still able to use it, but I have to be careful not to pick up as much or else the handle will break all the way."
4,Best scoop I ever used but....,"Scoopwell is the best scoop I've ever used because it picks up even the tiniest pieces. Unfortunately my handle snapped off last night after only five months. Maybe five months is considered a long time in the scoop world but I think it's too soon for what it cost (I paid more at another site which is why I'm purchasing this one at Amazon). Yes, I'm even surprising myself by getting another but it really is the best. If the design hasn't changed to make the handle stronger I'll just use it as a second scoop for the fine tuning and leave the initial scooping to a metal scoop."
4,"Love this scoop, but could be stronger, I broke two but will buy again.","It's not a shovel. I broke two trying to push it through 3-4 inches of clumping litter. I love the grate, it gets bits the others can't. Metal blade cleans the bottom of the pan nicely."
4,Good product,"It is a strong product, but it is greater than I have supposed. Unfortunately, it is very large to my cat litter box...Maybe it would be good when you have more than one cat at home and a big cat litter box too."
1,Not for heavy use,"We have three litter boxes for a number of foster cats. After about a week or so of daily scooping, the metal edge just came off, and a few days later the handle snapped. Not a good buy."
2,In search of the perfect litter scoop? Keep searching . . .,"The money I spent on the ScoopWell Premium Litter Scoop was not well spent! Although this scoop has two nice features--the extra long handle and the metal edge on the front end--the design is otherwise poor: litter granules get caught where metal meets plastic and the smaller sifting screen does not catch small-sized bits of waste. I end up using the front corners of my $1.99 plastic scoop to pick up all the little bits the ScoopWell leaves behind! Oh well, the search for the perfect litter scoop continues . . ."
3,A great scooper but flawed,This is a great scooper but it breaks easily and doesn't last as long as it should. If you are lucky 3-4 months. The screening part is perfect for getting the small bits but the handle where it meets the scooper is weak and breaks. You can see the seam and the weak point. How disappointing. You would think they would make the scooper out of steel as others have to make this the perfect scooper. If you can afford to buy one every 3-4 months then I highly recommend it. You might as well buy a few at a time.
3,"Great Scoop, Poor Handle","I have just broken my 4th Scoopwell. No matter how I try to remember that it will not hold up to scooping too much litter at one time, I always end up forgetting and breaking them. It seems that the handle is not strong enough to keep up with the rest of the scoop. I will buy another one, because I can't find any other scoop with the wonderful screen to pick up small bits of clumped litter; however, I wish the makers of this scoop would do something to improve the strength of the handle, like make it out of metal."
4,Litter scoop,"Great product with nice LONG handle and two sizes of mesh in scoop. Wish the mesh in the front (toward the outer edge) was a little ""finer,"" but works very well ----- MUCH better than traditional ones sold in stores."
3,Handle Breaks,"I scoop up buried treasures from my two cats everyday. This scoop is a great tool with two different sized mesh screens for sifting, a metal scraper edge, and a nice long handle with a comfortable grip.The only problem is, the handle broke off after about 10 months use. Still, it's a a great scooper and I'm going to buy a replacement until I find something better. Hopefully before 10 months!"
2,"Good with Solids, No So Good with Liquid","It's a litter scoop, so there's not a whole lot to say about it.Works great with solids. However, because it relies on a kind of sifting action, it's not so great with solidified liquids. The sifting causes the clumps to break apart. So you're left with either tossing out ""clean"" litter or having ""dirty"" litter break apart and fall back into the box.I've tried many scoops. This one is nothing special and it's expensive. That expense is what lost it one star."
2,Great scooper but handle breaks easily,"This was a super scooper until the handle broke. The metal edge on this scooper was great for scraping the bottom of the litter box, the screen is great for filtering out smaller particles - the litter really gets clean. The handle has a nice grip and is long, but it is weak. After four months of use the handle snapped off right at the scooper. I bought a second and it broke after three months of use at the same handle location. I ended up replacing it with a Duranimals DuraScoop Cat Litter Scoop - it has a shorter handle and doesn't filter the litter as well, but it is solid metal that scrapes the litter boxes well - it will last forever."
5,Great product,This product works just as described. The litter is cleaner and scooping takes less time.
4,A great product,"This is the best scoop that I've ever used. It does an excellent job of sifting out the little bits as well as the big pieces and has a very generous scoop size so you can get a lot done quickly. The metal edge on the front of the scoop is very useful for scraping, but does get clogged and needs rinsing now and again - yuk. Very sturdy, I can't imagine how others have broken them, unless they were trying to use the metal edge to press things that weren't meant to be pressed. I only with it had one additional layer of fine sifting available."
3,Dooped by a Scoop,"While I do like the longer handle, the 'quality' of the scooping is not much better than my inexpensive plastic scoops. I do use it, but am not sure it was worth the extra bucks."
2,"Does the job, but...","2 medium-small indoor cats. Clumping litter, tried multiple brands litter same results.I think the design is flawed in that it only has one ""sifting"" surface on the scoop and the metal grating seems to get ""overwhelmed"" every scoop and require much ""tapping"" on box side to try to free up, which in turn cause considerable ""solids"" to just ""jump"" right off the front of scoop and back in the box.Seriously, I was spending 3x as long with this chore and went back to my old cheapie plastic scoop, essentially the entire scoop is grated (sides, back, bottom), and tossed this one aside."
5,arabic-english dictionary,FAbulous book for me who knows no arabic to try to convey words and ideas. It also has arabic to english so our friends can communicate with us and english to arabic so we can communicate to them. Love that it is all alphabetical. Easy to use.
2,Does not offer enough information,I was disappointed in this dictionary- it's really not comprehensive enough to be of use.
2,Rationalistic,"Though this volume is in the Tyndale series, don't mistake it for a conservative commentary. It has all the signs of liberal conclusions drawn by rationalist scholarship. Though Cole admits the numbers in the Bible lead to 1446 as the date of the Exodus, he rejects this date and opts for the reign of Raamses II (1290-1224) (see p. 42). Furthermore, he thinks that the ""sea of reeds"" the children of Israel crossed was dried overnight by an east wind, thus being only a few inches deep (see pp. 121-122). Of course, he fails to mention how the Egyptians could have drowned in a few inches of water.In the above-mentioned instances, the commentary is more an exposition of Cole's preconcieved notions than of the text of Scripture. Perhaps other parts are better, but the commentary's primary value lies in its presentation of alternate views, and thus it provides discernment practice."
3,reply to simba,"Though he did not like the book probably because he did not write it. He should have at least given the author a chance to reply, I see that he hides behind a pen name but does not reveal who he is. The book was written because of a love of a country that is no more. There were a great number of errors in the book many not due to the author but to bad editing, had he read the other book he might have seen a slight improvement. With no one to edit the book the author being her first book did not know how to proceed, perhaps Simba would like to edit the next one.Mrs V A Elderkin the author."
5,Insane power...,"If you arent a power user, such as gaming, video editing, or just someone who wants to brag...then move on. This processor is overpriced, overpowered, and made for entusiasts. However...if you are like me, this may be worth the cash!I have this processor in my Dell XPS Gen 3 computer system. It is pURE power when running games, multiple applications, or whatver it is you'd like it to do. It doesnt stall for a second. It's Intel, and its their power chip, here if ya want it."
2,This is not real Feng Shui,"I purchased this DVD in the hopes of having a visual guide to what is sometimes a complex process, Feng Shui.In my opinion, this video is not genuine Feng Shui, but a very light overview. She talks about the elements and how they can be arranged together, and that's as far as it goes. What she fails to address, and more critically, is the placement aspect of Feng Shui - directional or positional, the Ba Gua is never mentioned.She teaches you to arrange something, anywhere, using symbols and colors of the elements. In some demonstrations, I believe she gets her Feng Shui symbolism a bit wrong.I emailed them via their website, asking about their particular view of Feng Shui, about placement, etc., and I never received a response.Unfortunately, I do not recommend this video. It's not a good guide for authentic Feng Shui, it's not even real Feng Shui at all."
4,Good introduction to Gould,"When it comes to popular writings on Evolution, the two names I most often hear are Dawkins and Gould. While I've read several books from Dawkins, this is my first one from Gould. This one is in the essay format which it seems is the norm for Gould's books. Overall the essays vary in quality but for the most part they're good, although some are a little dated (which happens with any science books published 35-40 years ago). My favorite ones were the first section over Darwin and a section which looks at odd organisms. In this later section, you get some interesting essays such as one over the Irish Elk and my favorite essay about the lampsilis mussel, which makes itself look like a swimming fish in order to get attacked by larger fish, then it shoots spores into the larger fish. This book makes me want to read more of his works."
5,I just had to replace my old separate editions,"I owned each of the audio books in separate edition on audio CASSETTE. This should tell you how long i have had them. When I found them in this collection, on CD, I just had to replace my old set. Who has a cassette player in their car anymore?"
5,I wish it would never end!,This CD collection is wonderful! It's easy to get submerged into the storyline of each tale. We've been listening to a couple of chapters during dinner each night & will be sad when we've finished them all! The stories are appropriate & interesting for animal lovers of all ages.
4,Brings Some Life to the Piece,"For me, as for many classical music lovers of my age (same as Kalevi Aho), the music of Gustav Mahler played a big role in getting me excited about classical music, but it took a long time for me to appreciate the music of Anton Bruckner. Even after getting to really love some of Bruckner's symphonies, I found it hard to sit through No.5--until I listened to this crackling live performance conducted by the young Franz Welser-Möst, who manages to bring excitement and clarity to the score in equal measure. For those who are fond of say, 4, 7, 8, and 9, but have never been able to get into 5, this is definitely the disc."
3,Nice overview but lacks in useful examples,"Unfortunately, this book suffers from the same affliction that most programming books suffer from. There are absolutely no useful code examples in the book. Yes, as an experienced engineer, I can substitute my own code where the book prints to the screen or searches for monkeys, but hey, I paid for my ticket, sometimes I'd like to be told exactly what to do. If I wanted to figure out everything on my own, I wouldn't have purchased a book in the first place."
1,Molly Hatchet?!?!?!?!?!,"Fans of the early Hatchet, PLEASE BEWARE!!!! This is NOT Molly of old. I don't know what these folks who are raving about this are coming from. I have seen southern rock cover bands kick this ""Molly"" all to hell. They are also a very disapointing live show with this lineup. I am all for the band to continue but they never were the same with out Danny Joe Brown."
1,WHERE IS MOLLY HATCHET?,"I really don't understand why these guys named this band Molly Hatchet. There is noone from the real Molly Hatchet in it. Any former! Let me tell you Molly Hatchet is David Hlubek, Duane Roland, Danny Joe Brown, Steve Holland, Banner Thomas, Jimmy Farrar, Riff West, Bruce Crump, John Galvin. I think Molly Hatchet died on 1985. I don't accept anything Molly Hatchet after 1985, these guys must change their names. Buy the real Molly Hatchet albums. From 1978 to 1985, do your self a favor."
4,Just picked it up...,"last week, and I'm glad that I did, this cd smokes! A must for any classic rock fan who's too old for rap and too young for country, find yourself a copy and enjoy the hell out of it!"
4,A great record,"When the ""new"" Hatchet emerged I was quite skeptical. Was not sure if Molly of the latter day Hatchets had the stuff. Mos def was not gonna gamble import prices on them. Lately however my interest peaked and I pick up a used copy of TSROH. Its is a great record. 9 of the ten tracks blaze. Sort of a Judas Priest meets Lynyrd Skynrd type sound. Good singing good playing. The only clunker is the semi aciustic remake of Fall Of The Peace Makers. The big guitar rave up at the end with an almost Moody Blues type of take on things. Cost this effort a star 4 instead of 5. Otherwise a great effort."
4,This is what Christian music should be!!!!,"Wonderful music!! Forrest offers and eclectic rock sound that has matured from folk James Taylor-style earlier indie albums. Not only is his music inspiring, but his lyrics send a greater message to us all. His messages are rather blunt yet he delivers them with such humor, ease, and compassion that it is rather difficult not to be inspired by him. Great, great album!!! Keep it comin', Sean!!!"
3,"""Green Acres...""","While still plowing the acres in defining their sound and songwriting, the sophomore effort is a mixed grab bag of strange, evocative pieces...and utterly forgettable oddities. Dave Lawson really shines on ""Sunkissed You're Not"",displaying his distinctive voice while dueling with Greenslade in a formidable keyboard exchange. Also beautifully eerie is the title track which opens the CD, setting the stage for the unique brand of aural originality that follows. Still, this disc is not the achievement of either ""Spyglass Guest"" or the final, ""Time and Tide"". Interesting, if rather uneven."
3,"A happy, but uneven album.","Mid-seventies Greenslade might very well be the mariachi of progressive rock. Just about all of his songs are bouncy with catchy, interesting keyboard solos. The lyrics tend towards tight one-lined cleverness, but are never overly sentimental or bitter. The title track and ""Pilgrim's Progress"" are fine vehicles for some awesome keyboard solos. ""Time To Dream"" is made exceptional for Dave Lawson's vocal and another keyboard solo. ""Drum Folk"" unfortunately is too long cumbersome for the needless drum solo, which spoils and detracts from the extended organ workout afterwards. ""Sunkissed you're not"" begins with a weak vocal, but builds to a redeeming funky jazziness. The last track, ""Chalkhill"" is the third instrumental and, despite the fact that it is the most propulsive of the three, seems to lack the imagination of the former two. In all, the Bedside Manners Album may not be the most progressive of rock albums, but it is a wonderful time piece of mid-seventies music."
4,Entertaining and excellent,I very much enjoyed this book. The writing style made it a pleasure to read. I downgraded it one star because it doesn't much cover the newer neodymium magnets nor how magnet manufacture has shifted to Japan and primarily China.
4,"Initially segmented, then brilliant, eventually annoying","Imi has got one of those voices you either love or hate, sometimes both within the space of a song. After hearing her earliest work before she was signed up, I can't help but feel she has got a little carried away with clever electrical production. However, this doesn't detract from the brilliance of her song writing. There are some really spine-tingling moments in songs such as 'oh me oh my' and 'rake it in' and I wait with baited breath for her next album."
4,Almost as good as Speak For Yourself...,"Yes, almost as good as her well-known ""Speak For Yourself"". Again, not thrilled about every songs, but all have something to offer and she is very talented. This album doesn't seem as polished, but at the same time that's not necessarily a bad thing. This is a good album to pick up!"
4,I Megaphone,"This CD is a decent introduction to Imogen Heap, although I much prefer Speak for Yourself to show off her skills. The CD is piano heavy and has some great tracks like ""Come here boy"" which never got radio play. I recommend it for those trying to see the different sides of Imogen Heap."
3,based on one song,"This song (Come Here Boy) has been driving me nuts! The first few times I heard it, it seemed as if it was an artist I was already familiar with..like Tori, Fiona, Sarah...similar, but not quite...qualities of each, but with something original brought to the mix. Will definitely get this CD."
2,Editorial Missing Part,"How can you write an Editorial about Imogen Heap- EsPECially I Megaphone without a nod to Tori Amos? They could be sisters...And~ Love them both. I just personally tend toward Imogen's, like Tori's, more Melodic pieces from other cds.But~ everyone's got their own taste. Great Artist, though, always."
2,Nothing Special. Frou Frou and the Speak for you self are all you need,"Im writing this review as a lover of Details, and Speak For Yourself. I Megaphone has a very negative, and bitchy tone to it. Imogen sounds very angry throughout the album,complaining about not recieving enough attention, or love. Much of the subject matter is the same throughout. She is copying alot of Toris style a bit to much. The songs are dry and thin, with the exception of the final two tracks. If you really want to discover this artist and her true talent, which wasn't realised on at this point in her creation of albums, check out Speak For Yourself."
3,Do you hear what I hear? Imogen Amos,"Many vocalists and bands get their start sounding more like someone other than who they become. (That is if they ever grow.)I'm listening to this album right now, and I keep thinking: Tori Amos. The cascading piano, the short-breathed vocals, the dark and brooding lyrics and the atmospheric intros.Check out the album cover. What do you see? Long red locks. If that isn't the icing on the I-wanna-be-a-piano-playing-vocalist-like-Tori cake, I don't know what is.Not that it's bad to emulate Tori. Imogen does a great job with the genre, but I already own every Tori Amos album. So I'm tremedously happy Imogen grew into a style all her own. Beyond expanding my collection with yet another female voice, her new style broadens and diversifies it.Summary conclusion: Unless you've heard this album and really like the sound, don't spend $30 or more on it. It's quite unlike Frou Frou or ""Speak for Yourself."""
4,Get It Now!!,"My roommate bought this album when it first came out. I was immediately in awe. The ""hit"" singles are Come Here Boy (in immi's words, ""the story of an almost affair with a married man."") and Candlelight. Here lyrics are interesting, entertaining and poetic. After a listen or two to this album, I had the opportunity to see her live in a very small venue. Thus ended any questions I had about her talents as a musician and performer. With just a piano and her voice she filled the place with a passion and presence rarely seen in the music world today. Though she was quite young at the time she held her own and put on a great show. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of her second album with a project called FrouFrou, due out sometime soon."
2,Dishonest Run Time Info...Why Lie?,"As a consumer, I feel cheated because I paid for a video that was advertised as 35 minutes run time, but this DVD & ""Let's Go to the Ocean"" is actually only 25 minutes including beginning & end credits. That's a big difference for such a short video. The 35 minute run time is printed on the DVD jewel case & on the DVD itself. I went on ""kidsmusicalyoga.com"" & sent an e-mail asking for an explanation or even an apology, but my e-mail was ignored.As far as the content of the video, my kids do like it for the songs which are catchy for pre-schoolers. However, I was disappointed by the lack of actual activity/yoga/exercise the video asks of the kids. It's more of a sing-a-long video...I was just expecting more movement.I just want to give other moms a ""heads up"" so you know what you're paying for & aren't disappointed."
1,Really Feel Cheated,"I ordered this video and Yogakids at the same time.Kids Musical Yoga is pretty much just a sing along. The children get to do almost no yoga at all. It is especially misleading since the cover shows a girl in the tree pose. When the video was over, I thought that was just the introduction and that the REAL video would start soon. It is a complete scam.Meanwhile, Yogakids is a fabulous video with real yoga poses, footage of real animals and a wonderful explanation of how to use the poses in our real lives. My 2 1/2 year old loves it. I recommend Yogakids as an excellent alternative to this non-yoga video."
2,The Wayne's World of Yoga,"Ai yi yi. My kids (3 1/2 & 2) actually really liked this DVD, even though they weren't interested in participating themselves. Maybe it is because they had never seen actual mental patients before? I am hoping that I can grin and bear it so that I can get them to start doing the movements as well, but I might need a lobotomy first."
2,A little weird and disappointing,"I agree with a previous reviewer that Yoga Kids (vol 2) is far better than this series of yoga videos for kids. I found this series (Kids Musical Yoga Lets Go To The Ocean/Jungle) to be disappointing. I like the original music and found myself singing the tunes later (any may consider getting the CD). But there was very little yoga - maybe 6 poses or so (and odd ones at that). There was a lot of talking, way too much talking, by the instructor who had a condescending manner or was just a little weird.This video had potential if it has way more poses and songs, and way less talking."
1,"Please, do not waste your money","I wish I would've read the 1 and 2 stars reviews, they are 100% right, this is a very short DVD, only really 15 to 20 min of a very poorly made sing along dvd, the songs are really not that great, there is no yoga at all, not excersice, for example you will find that they go to the jungle and they see a monkey, so you imagine they will do a yoga pose, NO they just get bunch of bananas that pass along to share.... my kids just look at each other like what do we supose to do now, go grab bananas??? Even the kids in the DVD do not look like they are having a great time, not blame, the teachers are not very energetic happilly conducting them. I just wish I could get my money back.... Good yoga DVD is the ABC yoga made for Yoga Kids with Marsha WenigYoga Kids, Vol. 2: ABC's for Ages 3-6, best yoga Kids DVD, my sons love it"
5,Can't pull kids away,"Our children have been captivated by Kids Musical Yoga for an entire year - the jungle is their favorite! They love singing along and learning the poses. They also enjoy incorporating the yoga and music into their daily lives - singing along with the CD on car trips and recreating the poses in their room. It teaches sharing, breathing, exercising and musical development. WE LOVE KIDS MUSICAL YOGA!"

5,Highly Recommended,Loved this book. Great pictures. Love the side captions. Wiliam Sonoma does it right with these books. I own the entire collection and plan on having them for a very long time. Hopefully one day will be able to say I made every recipe in the book which seems possible. Some people my not like the limited number of recipes but I feel this is a great example of quality over quantity. Somebody really put some love in this book and it shows. Everything I have made so far has been great. Once you buy one you will want them all. Makes me want to travel to Italy!
5,Amish Society,"This was the most informative book on the Amish lifestyle that I have found. The author opens up the life of the amish to his readers. It is easy to understand. He takes you through the history, culture and beliefs. I have a deeper respect for the amish and understanding of their customs since purchasing this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a look into a different way of life. This book opened my eyes and my heart to respecting the amish lifestyle and their privacy."
4,Nice Read!,"For such a long book, it was a decent read. I little boring sometimes, but did provide a wealth of knowledge and history to someone when needing it. I got an A+ on my research paper and have suggested the read to others."
3,Could be better,"It's a good book, but any adjective stronger than that would overstate it. The first chapter is nothing but sociological bombast that does not advance the reader's understanding of Amish society. The book improves after that, but Hostetler relapses into sociological jargon every several pages."
3,"Er, uh, good!","Quick Smoke is like any other bands b-side collection: some of it is gold while some of it borders on negligable. But still, a church fan, like myself, would like this."
3,This is not essential,"The songs of this CD are demos plus some acoustic performances from the Starfish/Gold Afternoon Fix era. The sound is not great and they are full of drum machines, but if you are a hard Church fan you should have this or the recent releases of Starfish and GAF which have these songs on a bonus disc. Some songs are so so, but there are others which have a great potential and should have been re-recorded properly. I guess there was no money to record discarded songs."
4,Boot shaft unlined,This is a great boot and it fits well. The foot is leather lined but the shaft of the boot is unlined and is very thin leather. I bought and returned them because of the unlined shaft. Boots are supposed to be warm and that unlined shaft would not be as warm as the average boot.
2,I don't like it,"I bought the spiral bound edition for ease of copying the patient eduction materials. However the binding is too flimsy for the weight of the book and was torn upon delivery. I returned the book. The guidelines are too basic for practical use for an experienced practitioner. Possibly helpful for a beginning family nurse practitioner student. Book does not include the most current, critical evidenced based guidelines for advanced or complex care. Half of the guidelines are for pediatric well child care."
3,OK for the Price,"I recently purchased these lenses to use with my Sony DSC-W7 camera.So far I have only used the 2X telephoto lens. It gave me ok results,but not exactly what I expected. You have to extend your zoom all theway out, or you will see a tunnel effect from the adapter tube. All inall, it helped me get closer shots of my son playing T-ball."
3,Control,"I don't always control the direction of my valve or logsplitter, but when I do, I always use this item."
4,Easy way to learn to recognize constellations,"A simple but effective approach, ""Stikky Night Skies"" teaches the reader how to recognize six constellations, 4 major stars, a planet, and how to always determine north in the night sky. Besides showing the constellation pattern and describing how to recognize it the book contains multiple pages of actually night skies to practice on. After completing the book it is fairly simple to locate each of the constellations mentioned.I did have one problem with the book. The gluing method used to attach the cover on my copy was of such poor quality that the cover came off with just one reading. Of course it can just be glued back on with good quality hot glue, but you would expect it to be of better quality from the beginning.Other than this one caveat, if you want to know how to recognize a handful of constellations that you can use as a base to learn other ones, you can't go wrong with ""Stikky Night Skies""."
2,Pitchy-ness,"To use a comment from the judges on American idol - the singers in the leading roles suffer from a little pitchy-ness. I've very much enjoyed Angela Gheorghiu's solo recital disks, but when the Alagnas sing together, they have a tendency to sing on the sharp side. I wonder which one drags the other off pitch?I've been enjoying live-performance recordings lately that really draw you into the opera house and onto the stage. The image I had while listening to this performance was of soloists standing behind music stands turning the pages of their music."
5,First class Carmen,"As much I don't like the Guiraud version of Carmen, just finishing this CD set I have to give a five stars rating: great conducting by Plasson and an excellent cast leading by the fabulous Angela Gheorghiu, that provides a magnificent performance. Alagna, Mula and Hampson second her in great shape.As a curious note, the inclusion of the original version of the famous Habanera give us the oportunity to judge as a whole Bizet's full creation.For me, pairing this one with Abbado's version (DG, with Teresa Berganza) and I have a complete experience of one of my favorite operas."
3,gloves,"The gloves are light, warm and comfortable but they pick up dirt very easily and are very expensive to dryclean."
2,pretty but cheap quality on major parts,We bought this shelving unit and the tv stand. The unit and wood is pretty. My complaint is that the company uses plastic clips for the shelves which break easily. Also the cabinet has metal handles that come off every time you try and open the doors. The wood is such a great quality that it's a major disappointment that little things like clips and handles can mess up an entire unit. We have to use pliers just to open the doors! :( I called home decorators and they gave me the run around and offered no solutions as of yet. I wouldn't buy this unit again.
3,Lots of info but hard to find,This book has lots of information in it but is hard to find unless you already know the answer. Not a beginners book at all.
3,"Good many topics covered, but individual coverage thin","Good book, lots of topics covered, but the coverage on any one topic is thin, too thin in my opinion. He explains how to set up and configure an FTP server via the GUI. I don't use the gui and wish he would give step by step instructions on how to do this. An integral part of setting up an FTP server is to show how to add users, this guys doesn't even come close to even thinking about how to set up users.Bottom line--If you want a little bit of information on practically all opics this is your book, if you want detailed information as to how to do something, well look elsewhere."
3,Fine for beginner,"I found The Complete Reference not very complete. If you are a PC user and making the move to Linux you will fine this book very helpful. If you are a Unix user (Solaris, AIX, HPUX etc...) and are transitioning to Linux you will find this book severely lacking. For the most part it only shows you how to do things using the GUI. The book gives no reference to the underlying files/commands that are being edited/executed. Most Unix users prefer command line which allows for automation through scripting not to mention the ability to troubleshoot."
3,LeapFrog Rhyming Lion,"I bought this item for my one-year-old son. When I first took it out of the package, I was a little disappointed because it was so small, and the ""rhymes"" that the lion sings are rather annoying. (The songs get stuck in my head, and I end up humming them all day at work.)However, much to my dismay, my son LOVES this toy because it is easy for him to control. All he has to do is spin the lion's belly, and the lion lights up and starts to sing. He gets very excited about it and roars back at the lion.As for the educational aspect, I don't think this item rates very high. The lion does ask about colors, but the pictures are too small for a parent to actually point to the color the lion is asking for. As for language development, if you don't talk to your child and you would like him/her to grow up speaking to mechanical toys, then this is the toy for you."
4,OK so far,"You may be wondering, as I was, who is the manufacturer of the drive inside the Iogear case. It is an IBM Deskstar 60GXP (model IC35L040AVER07) - 7200 RPM, UltraATA/100, very quiet. The USB drivers work natively under Win 2000 and XP, very easy to use. It is a nice system and I'd like to see Iogear sell it with a better power supply, because the first time I plugged it into the drive, one of the cheapo pins bent and had to be bent back -- so be careful about that. But otherwise it's been fine."
2,Does not fully work with Macintosh computers,This drive does not work as advertised. It comes formated as FAT32 for DOS and cannot be reformated for Macintosh unless using OS X - the box says it will work with Mac OS 8.6 and above. This is straight from IO Gear's technical support!
4,"Good product, but rebate was a scam","I'm enjoying having the flexibility of the external hard drive, but disappointed that the rebate turned out to be a scam. I cut out the only code on the side of the box and mailed it in, and they said that I did not send the right bar code. It is the only one on the box. I assume this is either an Iogear issue or one with the company that handles their rebates. It's a shame, because I know I won't buy a product from them again due to their exercising poor faith in following up on the promised rebate."
4,No Problem with Windows 2000 Professional,"I wrote this review in response to another review about the ""problem with Windows 2000 Pro"". I had this IOGEAR GHE135U enclosure with my old hard drive (ATA66) with Windows 2000 Pro SP3, it has no problem at all. The Windows 2000 found it and installed it as ""Disk Drive"" at very first time when connecting it. About this, it is also clearly stated at its manual...""no driver need for ME, 2000, XP"". The only thing I don't like is the extra external power adapter; however, I beleive it is a must in order to provide the extra voltages for the regular hard drive (12 Volt/5 Volt). I like the big switch in the front panel, which allow me to just turn if off (after I 'Stop' it at the OS) without need to unplug it."
4,stagerlee wonders,"Stagelee wonders how white folks think black folk make it and survive while they colonize, pillage, and plunder the rest of the world. Baldwin lays out with specificity, the ""crimes"" of the oppressor and warns with wit, sarcasm, and passion, that we hold the secret and wisdom to the world, as well as a promise of eternal life. He ""prophecies"" hell as the eventually resting place of the oppressor. Two other poets that seem to form a trilogy with ""Stagerlee Wonders"", are ""A lover's Question"", and ""Song (for skip). I had not heard of his poetry; what a wonderful collection on passionate gems!"
4,Johnny still the best!,"Having been a Johnny Winter fan for the past 15 years, and having seen him several times, this album is a great collection for any Johnny Winter fan. It is not his best work, but a good CD non the less. Since it is a 3-piece band, which Johnny prefers, he makes the most of the songs albiet they are cover tunes. I especially like his version of Bob Dylan's ""Like a rolling Stone"". and ""New York New York"". The atmosphere of the album seems to be Johnny just having fun, which as we know is when Johnny plays his best guitar!"
3,Does not use the roller ball in normal mouses,"A computer mouse can be a chocking hazard for a toddler if they take it apart, as there is a chokable part inside that little hands may find. I got this mouse for my daughter which functions differently than a normal one. There is no chokable part inside. It is a little less precise but it is also a little less dangerous. It is also cute looking for the playroom."
1,Not a very good design,"This isn't what I expected or wanted at all. The case itself looks nice and my Zire 72 is held fairly secure. However, the front of the sleeve covers up the sides of the buttons making it unwieldy to work with. And the case will not open completely to lie flat when using the PDA so I end up taking it out anyway. So I might as well go back to the slip-case that came with it.This 'wallet' isn't something I would buy for myself. Looks more like a man's.Since the 'wrapping' was destroyed getting the case out, I can't return it, but it's going in the next yard sale I have."
1,Doesn't Fit Palm's Zire 72,"The wallet looks nice. However it doesn't fit the Zire 72 very well. The leather that frames the screen is off center and covers the left edge of the screen, this would drive me crazy. My Zire 72 also easily fell out with a slight shake. The wallet does not open all the way either, This would mean you have to hold it like a book at all times. You cant flip the left cover all the way back and hold it in your ""PALM"" as you should be able to. This product's design is attractive but in no way functional with any device in my opinion as it doesn't allow you to use your palm in a comfortable position. This item is on its way back to amazon right now.Amazon however is the best online retail store, hands down. They get me my stuff, usually shipped for free, very quickly and are willing to accept returns."
1,Great Content.....Horrible Format,Though this is a great book all ebooks should come with a linked table of contents of which this edition is missing. Otherwise the book is unnavigatible.
4,"Here Piggy, Piggy!","I purchased a Korean DVD of this movie last year and thoroughly enjoyed it. It doesn't measure up to The Host in sfx or plot but is a fun popcorn monster on the loose romp. There is the usual Korean-style humor throwm in with a cast of characters you've seen in most modern creature on the loose productions: earnest/troubled young hero, cute female scientist, crusty wise old expert, brash hunter, etc. Better than a Syfy Channel cgi monster of the week with good actors, adequate if not spectacular sfx, and a tried and true plot."
5,"Funny, Entertaining & Scary!","This movie is great! It's funny and scary! There are some really funny, laugh out loud parts and then suddenly you're jumping out of your skin from being scared! Unique and very well done! Very refreshing movie!"
3,10th Inning,"I bought this book for my son and he seemed to enjoy it--there are plenty of great photos and some interesting, if wordy, stories--but what is the obsession with sports writers to divide all baseball books into nine ""innings""? Football writers don't feel any need to split their books into four ""quarters,"" golf writers don't limit themselves to 18 ""holes."" In this book, as in so many others, it is a clumsy cliche."
5,"My First Exposure To Old English As In The King James Version. Children's Rendition Of Sir Thomas Malory's ""Le Morte D'Arthur.""","Enter into a world where knights battle for ladies fair of fortune and beauty, where power-hungry kings and lords fight for honour, glory and evil is always present to be ultimately vanquished by the noble King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table. This book was my first exposure to the Old English pronouns as it appears in the King James Version of the Bible. This children's rendition of Sir Thomas Malory's epic ""Le Morte D'Arthur"" is an excellent and indispensable introduction to the timeless tome of chivalry, honour, love, lust, power, glory, honour and belief in God Eternal. I highly recommend this book & ""Le Morte D'Arthur"" (the Keith Baines rendition is most excellent)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"King Arthur and His Knights by Sir James Knowles is a nicely illustrated and approachable version of some of the Arthurian legends, with the younger reader in mind.i.e. Have cool pictures of guys in armor with swords to go along with the writing. As far as that goes, reasonably well done."
4,Entertaining -- But So Wrong,"As is true of so many westerns, this movie is entertaining -- but so wrong. Scenes involving saguaro can't be filmed in Texas. Texas was never a U.S. territory; it went from Mexican to independent republic to U.S. state. And the Brazos doesn't flow through a desert.On the other hand, the plot is a jovial little tale. The story progresses slowly, but has a few twists which keep it entertaining. And the climactic gunfight near the movie's end is actually more easily believed than most gun battles in movies."
4,once upon a texas train,Willie Nelson to me makes a great western movie star for he has the deepvoice and that bad guy look. I would recommend this movie if you like old westerns. TR
3,A movie for even non-western fans!,"I'm not a western fan, but I enjoyed this movie! Country & western singer Willie Nelson does a great job portraying his villainy character, John Henry Lee, a person that tries to blow up a railroad. Former 70's teen rock idol Shaun Cassidy's acting has improved since his work as Joe Hardy on T.V.'s ""Hardy Boys Mysteries"", even though he still pursued his acting career after the show ended in T.V. and national theatre, and is now a T.V. producer and writer. He does fairly well playing a young gang leader named Cotton. For a T.V. movie, this is made on a good budget and still gets played on T.V. stations. Check it out if you see it advertise on your local T.V. listings!"
5,Used but works great,"I ordred this cd. It arrived fast. It looked very old as its age. However it works great. I like most of the songs in this cd, especially mona lisa. I like Nat king cole warm voice. He's singing like he's is talking to you."
2,A weak effort I wasn't expecting...,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but my viewing last night was not without disappointment. Mastroianni gives a beautiful performance in a film that is somewhat awkward and uneven and doesn't really know how to connect the dots effectively. It throws themes at us and situations that don't entirely gel, and that's a pity because the idea behind the film is compelling and could have been truly moving. The film centers on a widower who makes a strong connection with his granddaughter when she is basically left in his care through the immaturity of her parents. Just when life starts to feel somewhat `normal', the girl's mother shows up and throws everything off kilter. It just doesn't all work, and the poor production values make this feel very low impact and cheap. Mastroianni explores deeper emotions, but the screenplays lack of depth keep him from truly transcending."
5,review,Famed Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni (LA DOLCE VITA) plays a widowed man who has to care for his young granddaughter--who has been abandoned on his doorstep--in TOWARDS EVENING.This is the only Sandrinne Bonnaire video. Stars also making their debut in this video: Zoe Incrocci.
1,This movie is garbage,Do NOT buy this movie if you want to be entertained. It is the WORST movie I have ever seen. Its obvious the positive reviews on here are from friends and family of the producer. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
4,Humor and Horror Bruce Campbell style.,"Evil Dead Regeneration is a hit with any fan of the evil dead movies or games. Although the game is a bit repetitive, it has all the elements that an Evil dead or gaming fan needs at an OUTSTANDING PRICE. While other games sell at 49.99$ first day you get a whole lotta' game for your price with this one.Humor and horror with a great story and laughs. They took away the ablity to throw out your own one liners.. That's fine. The action is packed. IF you haven't gotten this yet, your missing out. First person shooter fans will not be dissapointed as the game is mostly a 3d carnage fest."
5,Killer action game!!!,This game rocks!! It is much better than 'Hail to the king' by far!! The action is solid for a EVIL DEAD game. Graphics are awesome! Everything is awesome! BUY THIS GAME!!
1,Broken Cap,"These bottles have a wonderful ""patent pending"" cap, which consists a toothed base and top separated by a spring. The problem is that the two halves of the cap are joined by plastic butterfly tip, which means that any bump that snaps just one side of the rod will render the cap useless. Now, why brunton decided to patent this mechanism is beyond my understanding, since a monkey could have designed a better mechanism, and why the cap is made so that it can be carried by the cap is ridiculous, since any bump will break it. Either do yourself a favor and get a different bottle, or know that you will have to spend extra money buying a different brand cap."
5,Great book!,"Working as a tutor in my college's writing center, this book is not only fun, but very practical. Recommend for everyone!"
2,Not for me........,"After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a cute movie; however, my grandson and I lost interest and were quite bored with it and I am a big fan of kid movies. Evidently, it does not appeal to everyones tastes so know your movie before you buy."
2,2 stars for the comic aspect,"I rented this for my kids and I don't think they enjoyed it. I laughed hysterically over the bad acting and the huge, hairy boar. I still laugh thinking about it (if you've seen it, you know what I am talking about:)). So, I give it 2 stars, because it made me laugh but I don't think that I will ever, ever waste money on it again."
5,Family,I think is film has a heart worming story about Christmas and Magic.It is truly for the whole family.
1,I can't understand anything over one star!,"As the owner of approximately 150 Christmas movies, I only have one that is worse than this one! The plot was stupid, the acting was terrible; my one star is for Danielle Nicolet's character's acrobatics - don't know if it was really her or a stunt double, but it's pretty awesome."
3,Who knew...?,"These pedals are way cool lookin. I can't tell you how many people complimented the look of them in my car. The issues started a month after I had the pedals installed. They started to rattle and on the way to the shop to have them looked at, the accelerator pedal came loose and was barely functional enough to make it those last few blocks.Now, the shop guy told me thatthe pedals were stripped and couldn't be saved. So after a couple months use, I lost all my money invested in the pedals and install.He climaed it was because the pedels were flat and the pedals parts on the car are cured, not allowing a tight fit.Not sure where to put the blame, but it might be good if Razo had a matrix on their site that showed what cars miht have issues."
4,Check system requirements before ordering,"Looks like a great product, and it's a lot cheaper than the 5-port ones. Be sure you can meet the requirements listed on the manufacturer's web site, which I have copied here. (IOGEAR...)For PC users:* Windows 98SE, 2000, ME, XP* 300 Mhz or greater* Available PCI slotFor Mac users* Mac G3 or better* OS 8.6 to 9.2 (supports only USB 1.1)* OS X (supports USB 2.0)* Available PCI slot"
1,"Bug in chipset, IOGEAR is investigating",After installing the card it would instanteously reboot my Windows XP machine with no warning or proper shutdown. Escalated to IOGear and Tech. Support responded that they have a major bug on the last chipset on the card that they have not fixed. Recommended I return it for a refund.
1,why does amazon.com still sell this product?,"Here's what I got from tech support from IOGEAR:I would stay away from that particular card. We do have some drivers that fix some machines, but I would rather go with the GIC250U for now. Also just a tip. Dont buy any cards made by ALi. Stick with the NEC."
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD from the infamous Aussie band. Features the song, ""Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again"""
4,"Cute illustrations, great message","Everyone knows what it is like to have a bad day. This story follows Norbert and his really bad day at school. Even though he rides a roller coaster to school, he had no one to sit with. And at school no one picked him for a team, or sat with him at lunch. When he comes home sad, his mother shares a blessing with him. My 3 year old and 6 year old both enjoyed this story. The illustrations are absolutely wonderful, and the story has a very special message for both children and adults. I love the idea this story portrays, of blessing your child. I was also intrigued by the ""write your own blessing"" page at the end of the book. A good story for both parent and child"
2,Mediocre,"The title ""Creating 3D Comix"" would excite anyone interested in either graphics or 3D animation. Unfortunately, Mr. Mortier's book does not fully deliver on this exciting premise. Why are all the comics in this book so infantile? I was expecting something on the lines of a slick Heavy Metal cartoon. What I got instead was silly children stories. Some of Mr. Mortier artwork could be deemed original, but it is not very practical. Why does he have an obsession with distorted and morphed figures? What use would I get out of a character with large ears and a pointed nose? Some of his images also have a disturbing hallucinogenic look. For example, on page 364 there is a strange three-headed bug man. It is interesting for a few seconds, but what the heck I am going to do with it. With this book, Mr Mortier seems to be playing around like a child with a toy. However, playing with toys is something we all eventually grow out of."
1,Written by a 12 year old!,"3D comics is a speciality topic, and what a book on such a topic requires is an author with the proper speciality experience. Mr. Mortier demeonstrates quite clearly that he knows very little about the topic (or about writing). I, myself don't know much about 3D comics, should I write a book and try and sell it too?The images and characters in this book are distored, ugly aliens. Why? For one, I'm sure that Mr. Shamms really likes screwed up alien creatures, but this might also have to do with the fact that warped faced creatures are much easier to make, and require far less artistry/exprience/knowledge then anything photorealistic. A child could make Mr. Mortier's 'art'. Dumping your money into the sewer would be much more satisfying than paying for this book, and would essentially be the same thing."
5,Important work for all activists,"As an admirer of Avi Weiss for his actions and deeds, this book was just one reason why Rabbi Weiss is an amazing man. This book is for all activists who are frustrated by the failure of the establishment to enact true change and fight for justice. If you are part of the AMCHA -- the grassroots -- then this book is for you!"
2,Full shows not highlights I was looking for.,"I was looking for highlights of Fred Allen, not full shows with commercials and not Jack Benny, the stereotype of cheap Jewishness. I wanted to play Allen on my college radio show and don't have the know how to cut them up."
4,One bad puta,"Over the years I have read all, and posess all, of Louis L'Mour's books. Lonely men takes place in the Apache strong hold in the south west. Tell Sackett is persuaded by Orin Sackett's wife to go into the Apache strong hold to recaputure her son a five yr. old. Unknowing Tell tries to find his nephew (who does not exist)and his sister-in-law hopes the apaches kill him. this is a good story but it is not action packed all the time."
4,Works great for me!,Have two of these products for my laptops which do not have parallel ports. They work great and contrary to the folks above work well with all (that's 4 HP) old style printers I have that only have parallel ports. Suggest you install software first without being connected. Shut down. Connect mini port and printer. Then reboot. Printers install automatically on XP.
1,Don't waste your $,"I bought this belt from another website, but it is in the same packaging & same thing as listed above. It is very poorly made and if I had bought it in a store I would be returning it. It looks like something you would get at the dollar store but worse. It looks like it was made in a bad mold, and then quickly sewn on velcro & snaps which look like they might fall off. I would agree with the other reviewer, it smells funky. Save your $ and get something from the store instead."
3,Good!!,"This was a pretty ok movie. I watched it to kill the time so it proved it purpose, probably would not watch a second time."
1,Terrible Movie!!!,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time and I watch a lot of movies. It's terrible, a waste of money and a waste of time to watch. There is a reason why there's not many reviews and the price is so cheap because nobody buys this movie and for a good reason!"
3,"I Bought It By Mistake, Actually","Pretty standard alt-metal, radio ready and non-threatening. Pleasant to listen to but not exactly revolutionary. Think Alice In Chains, Big Head Todd or Stone Temple Pilots. Stand outs are `Pusher' and `Where'."
2,Far from the Nickelback we now know,"While this album lacks any true standout track, it still manages to be easier to listen to than ""The State"". That's why I'm giving it a 2. Buy it used if you simply have to hear it. Just don't expect too much in the way of impressive songwriting."
2,Hated it,"Delivery was quick but I was dissapointed with the music. I usually like Nickelback, just not this CD."
3,pass on it,"I like Nickelback , but this CD is not their bestpass on it and buy the ""three sided coin "" CD"
1,Disappointment,I'm not sure which CD the other reviewers were listening to. Chad and the boys should have taken longer that a half hour that it most likely took them to put the stuff together. If anyone can understand Chad's vocals on any of these tracks let me know. I would hope that they'd take more time putting out there next one..
2,I don't get it,"I'm sorry, but this just doesn't sound so great to me. If you like grunge, try Pearl Jam or Nirvana -- they're so much more original and... convincing. Sometimes Nickleback sounds like they're trying way too hard (or not hard enough?). Seriously this is kid's stuff, man. Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,It's a RE-RELEASE.,"""Curb,"" contrary to belief, is not a new album. Nickelback re-released its FIRST album. the album that started it all. ""Curb"" was initially self released in 1996 in Canada.To be burtally honest, the album, as it it should for a new group, sounds like unpolished demos, and their many one word titles reflect that fact as well. While several songs have more potential than they seem, most are simply rugged demos.I wondered how Nickelback released a album so soon after ""silver side up,"" so I researched before I set my opinion in the proverabal ""stone."""
2,Really Monotonous,"Ok, I like Nickelback, but after hearing this album, I understand why it wasn't until their second album that they got famous. I literally got a headache from how repetitive and monotonous Chad Kroeger's singing was.The album really wasn't that expensive, which was good, but I still don't think that spending money on it is a wise decision. It's probably a better idea to go out and buy Theory of a Deadman instead."
3,"Excellent clarity, maybe overly bright for some","I own the 0.5M cable connecting a VPI Scout TT to a Creek Destiny integrated amp.The detail and separation are quite good. I will caution however, the overall sound is fairly bright. It's funny bc I had read that somewhere else and basically blew it off. I'm pleased with how it's working out with my present cart (grado sonata) but honestly I would prefer a more neutral interconnect. As with most gear, buy used and see how it works with your setup. I will probably move onto something else."
3,A good little cable,"No, they are not the King Cobra; if you can afford twice as much, then by all means do so. If your budget does not allow, then use these. If not, at least get the snake. They are still better than stock cables.It sounds crazy, but cables matter. I have used a dozen different ones and they have gotten better and cheaper over the last dozen years. Note, they are directional. You will see arrows pointing in the direction of the signal.But it is all to no avail if you do not keep the ends polished, and then lubricated with a little oil to finish the connection. This goes for polishing the sockets on the components. It even goes for the power cords. Try it. Take everything apart, polish all the ends on every component and cable and finish with oil and see how the sound improves."
1,Bad connectors,All the 'snake' types of interconnects from AudioQuest that I have used have broken. The solder job on the connectors is very weak and seems to wear out quickly. This has happened to me consistently with both the Diamondbacks and the Copperheads (no longer made). Email to AQ goes unanswered.
4,A Civil War tale for everyone.,"This book accurately and vividly details the life of the common soldier in the Union army during the Civil War. You follow along with Nathan Clark as he lives through the travails of Antietam, Fredricksburg, and Gettysburg. The story is rich with the description of armies on the march, great battles, and the longing for loved ones.Mr. Filegar, aside from being a promising new author, has also been deeply involved in Civil War re-enactments for years, and this is obvious from his writing. Nowhere, have I seen a better, more thorough description of camp life. He has captured the essence of the everyday life of the common foot soldier and set it before the reader to delve into. The humor, the tragedy, the frustration, the hardships, and even the victories overcome you with an emotional impact that leaves you wanting more.The subtitle of this work is ""Book One"". Let us hope that the subsequent works are not long in coming."
2,very interesting,"I had to read this book for a class a few years ago, and I found it to be extremely thought provoking. At the same time, though, it was very difficult to read, and I found myself nodding off unintentionally. Great on the subject of evolution though! Broken down into several distinct essays."
5,The only book you'll need.,"I have taught elementary math for over 20 years, and have a master's degree in math education. I found this to be the best book on teaching basic concept of addition and subtraction I have ever had. There are numerous activities which require little preparation, group and individual activities, all of which will teach your students to understand the real meaning of the concepts and help them develop fluency with numbers that will make a significant difference in their futures with math."
2,Disappointed,I was well up for this DVD and the first 15 minutes or so didn't let me down but the rest was so so and ended up leaving me quite disappointed. Cedric was good but didn't appear in it enough. What was it 2 or 3 segments? The other guys were OK and had some good material that created a few laughs but no bellyache and u gotta get a bellyache to really enjoy a good stand-up show. Although I think Cedric is funnier than Harvey I actually rate Harvey's stand-up show more than this because he was the star of the show and had 2 separate performances on his DVD. A serious let-down that has left me in doubts about the sequel.
4,You Got That Luther,"This DVD was not exactly all that but at least it gave up and comer's a chance to shine. The 1st, 2nd and last guy were the funniest. The 3rd guy could've stayed at home. He won't live long in the comedy business. And then you had Cedric with his jokes. They were funny but not Kings of Comedy level. My opinion is its worth buying and watching."
2,"Many parts were painful to watch, they were so bad","I loved Cedric the Entertainer in the Kings of Comedy. I initially thought this was a tape of just Cedric, but only after buying it did I realize that he was essentially the MC for a bunch of lesser-known comics. While Cedric did a bit of stuff between comics, I felt that even he was not on point. And as to the other comedians, while I got a chuckle here and there, overall this was not funny, at least IMHO. And the first comedian in particular... I found it painful to watch him. I thought he was pretty bad. Anyway, I'll be donating this tape to my local Salvation Army. Not even worth trying to sell it on Amazon."
1,defective scooter,this product has a defective battery. Battery runs out after a few minutesRazor A Kick Scooter
1,this thing stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this scooter is a horrable deal. my son bought it 1 year ago and when we got it, the stupid thing didnt even work!!! i hate this product. never buy it!!!!!!!!!! oh ya one more thing... it still doesnt work. we've even tried to fix it but it still won't work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont buy this scooter!! ... ever!!"
2,Initially thrilled,"Found it fairly simple to put together. Declared as the best present ever until it broke after the 1st week. Perfect fit size and speed wise for my 10 year old. However, the 1st day she drove it we were told they were illegal in our city. After it broke within the motor part of it, we were unable to return it as I did not keep the huge box and packaging it came in. It would have been a great deal if we were able to legally drive it here and it worked longer than the 1st week. Hugely excited turned to majorly disappointed in no time flat. Nearest repair shop for these is an hour and 45 minutes away. Not sure it's worth going to the expense but just hate to throw my money away like that. Bummer!"
4,excellent scooter!,"We bought this scooter for our 12 year old son. He loves it and is constantly riding around the neighborhood. It has worked well on hills, long walks, and just riding around for fun. It has no problem going up hills even carrying his 130 pound frame. I would recommend it. It is not a dirt bike, but it is a lot of fun."
5,Crustacea Guide Of The World,"Crustacea Guide Of The World, althought written for the lay ""marine biologist"" is none-the-less scientifically correct. The book is divided into two sections, Atlantic decapods and Pacific decapods, giving the reader the ability to more acurately and quickly identify the animal of interest. Included within the text are short stories illuminating interesting behaviors of decapods. Paired with a photograph of each animal the author has provided, along with a concise description, the geographical distribution. For anyone interested in marine life I highly recommend this book to be added to their library."
5,Incredible Creepie-Crawlies,"This is an incredible achievement - stunning photographs of shrimps, crabs and 'prawns' from all over the world - more than any diver could hope to see in a lifetime. The quality of the reproductions and the wealth of biological information makes this a must-have book for anyone who likes to see more than just a few coloured fish when they dive. It is particularly accessible to the non-scientist and I can't imagine anyone with an interest in marine life reading this and not learning something."
3,Lovely Book,"Lovely book, full of pictures and information.My criticism is there are more critters out there and so could be a much bigger and better book!Some better books out there."
2,"Not so ""real""","I got two of these ""Fur Real"" toys for my niece and nephew as gifts. They did all the things the box said they would but when their legs or necks moved there was a very loud popping noise. I thought that since both toys did it that ""Fur Real"" didn't seem worth the price. Later, I saw another relative who had also gotten the toy from another source (not online) and it worked perfectly- no popping noises. I was disappointed with my purchase."
3,tiger cub,"I like the looks of the white tiger cub...I am not impressed with the sounds. It definately doesn't sound cat like, but it is cute...I think kids will like it. I bought it for me as I collect tigers..Laura"
2,Not Robert Jordens best work.,"Not as good as the first 2 books of the Fallon series. Unlike the first 2, that showed the build up and then how a Fallon took part in first the revolutionary war, and then the war of 1812. The Fallon legacy leads up to both the civil war and the battle of the Alamo, but never gets into them. Also the book leaves allot unfinished. Let me put it this way. If the wheel of time ends the way this series does, the dark one will be set free, Mat will still be trying to get the daughter of the nine moons to marry him, and Rand will be wondering if now would be a good time to save the world. Oh and a forsaken will be waiting in the next room to kill him.Over all this was a let down. I'm really glad that RJ dropped this series and wrote the wheel of time."
1,This edition misses the point,"With Shaw's plays, the point is in the preface. In the case of Androcles and the Lion, the preface is Shaw's disquisition on Christianity -- he explains it and the Gospels, in his inimitable way -- for over a hundred pages. The preface to Androcles and the Lion is one of Shaw's masterpieces...and is MISSING from this edition. Could it possibly be that this is because those putting this travesty of Shaw's work out do not want Christian readers seeing Shaw's explanation?"
2,too creepy and scary for young ones,"I think this is inappropriate for young kids, because in this original story, the parents abandoned them in the forest, and the old woman used ""graphic"" details about how she is going to eat the kids! The art is very groomy too."
3,"Hensle and Grettle, not for kids?","When you think of kids stories, fairy tales, even fable what comes to mind? Cinderella, snow white, Hensle and Grettle maybe. Although these stories all have happy endings on a mutual basis. We try to tell our children that killing is wrong, but in the 3 above listed storis for ""kids"" atleast 1 person dies in each. The child like factor is in this book, a house made of candy and all that, but so is the violence that we try so hard to not teach. Although this book is entertaining, and fun to read so I give it a rate of 3 stars, i hope this review is found helpful as well as informal. thank you."
2,True to the original -- but creepy,"The back of the book explains that this retelling of the Hansel & Gretel story is consistent with an early version of the same first published by the Brothers Grimm. I have no doubt that this is true. The pictures are beautiful, and the story engaging. But this is not the version of the story where the old crone is a witch who turns children into gingerbread. Instead Hansel and Gretel, abandoned by their parents, find the house of the old crone in the middle of the woods. The old lady has plans to cook Hansel for dinner. Near the end of the book, Gretel pushes the old lady into the hot oven, locks the door and listens to the old lady's screams until the old lady is reduced to ashes. Then Hansel and Gretel loot her stuff. In the shadow of 20th century Germany, I found the story just plain creepy, and I put the book in a pile of things going to charity just to get it out of my house."
4,great,this book was great. it was sad in some parts like when hansel and gretel were capture by that old woman. then i liked how they found the beautiful jewels. that was cool. my favorite part is how they found the woodcutter and when home. this is a good story tale for kids.hansel and gretel by the brother grim
3,Concern,"My 2, 3 and 4-year-old loved this story, and asked me to read it again and again. The language is beautiful and evocative. The illustrations are just gorgeous. It was on the fifth or so reading that I noticed a rune and two pentagrams tucked around the witch's house. Not surprising because she is, well, a witch -- but I do prefer my children's literature without occult imagery. We are getting rid of this one."
4,"Surprisingly, I liked it","I agree with some reviews, that it was a western without rotten language, sex etc., but still had the true western violence (without being over the top in it's graphics). When I saw Randy Travis had the main role, I was like ""really? another grade B, cheap western"" but it was a Saturday afternoon, I was alone in the house and saw it listed on netflix. I have to be honost, that I actually liked it. Randy Travis was not the greatest actor I have ever seen, but turned in a prety good performance. The story was pretty good and was well filmed and pretty realistic. I will buy this from Amazon. They could have found a better kid for the part....his acting was not very good, but overall, this was a good western throughout and worth watching. Randy surprised me. He acts better than he sings. (my personal opinion)."
3,Its an ok movie,"This movie was OK, it took a long ride to get to the point on this movie.But Ernest Borgnine and Randy Travis, fans will like this movie.Thats why I bought it"
2,"I'm a Travis fan, but this movie not worth saving in my collection",Gift for my husband--we're both Randy Travis fans--but this was a waste of a good man's talents. Just couldn't hold our interest enough to complete watching. Trashed it.
1,Couldn't finish it...,"This was a complete disappointment as a Western. It was like 90 minutes of Vacation Bible School. If you like Westerns a la ""Lonesome Dove"" you won't enjoy this."
5,A Long Way fromHome: Growing Up in the American Heartland in,"A very interesting book that brings back a lot of memories for me, growing up in North Dakota during the same time period. I guess we were pretty much raised the same in this area. I am just now realizing that we were all pretty much in the same boat (we didn't have much, but we didn't realize it)."
4,"A Warm, Winning Memoir","This informal memoir of Brokaw's formative years tell us much about the man who brings us the news today. The focus is on his parent's lives and the first twenty years of his own life; it's clear that this was the time and place that shaped the values that govern his life--integrity, honesty, a dedication to doing things right. Although the tone is warm and nostalgic throughout, Brokaw does not view the past exclusively through rose-colored glasses; he's quite frank about the discriminaton Native Americans have suffered in his homeland; and he's quite open about a period of his own youth when he strayed off the right path for a while. Casual, nostalgic....a great read!"
4,Roots are essential,Brokaw gives a seemingly honest and direct account of his formative years. His respect and admiration for his parents gives him guidelines for a life in the limelight where it may be easy to loose one's footing.It is interesting to get a glimpse of the life in the heartland of the U. S. in the forties and fifties when so much of my own perception of the U. S. from a Scandinavian viewpoint was formed.Congratulations to Tom Brokaw for a fine book!
1,Half a Book,I don't know what the publisher was thinking. The spaces between the lines in the book look almost twice the size as a normal book. What has been done here is to offer a small book as a large one. It is funny that Mr. Brokaw is writing such a small book about his life. Is there nothing new to share with readers? Like bubblegum that has been elongated the book lacks flavor and zest and is really nothing more than text with Brokaw's face plastered on it. Next time Tom give us the whole story with a real book.
1,Boring,"This book was written for simpletons by a simpleton. Reading from a teleprompter is not exactly brain surgery. But if you want to hear more from a self-important blowhard, then read this intriguing book about an egomaniac who pretends he doesn't have one. Seriously, there couldn't be a worse book."
5,touching,"In our hearts we realize that wherever we lived in those days we were basically raised in the same manner. My heart swells when he speaks of Mother and father and their familial guidance. Those were the days you were taught any adult that speaks is in charge, when you speak it is Yes Mam, or Sir. I was raised in Detroit Michigan, being the same age as Mr. Brokaw the book spoke perfectly of our upbringing. I believe that our strength as a nation was shown by all ages after 9/11. Those values came charging back though some of the younger ones didn't know exactly where they had arrived from. We elders know. As the youth now say "" We are all on the same page"". I think we always were, a lot of us just didn't know."
1,South Dakota Boredom,"Tom Brokaw's fame make him a potentially fascinating subject for an autobiography, yet such lofty expectations will only serve to increase your disappointment in this book. It doesn't take long to discover that Brokaw's upbringing is so mundane and ordinary that it's almost painful to tread through this book. I suppose there may be some ardent fans of his or maybe family or friends of Brokaw's that would want to know the minute details of his early life, but otherwise you might as well be reading about any random person from mid 20th century South Dakota. Nothing out of the ordinary at all happens in Brokaw's early life and this book deals with none of the latter half of his life (where he actually became noteworthy), thus unless you have insomnia I don't recommend bothering with this book at all."
3,"Why, Shout Factory, Why?","Final Sacrifice is one of my favorite episodes. I've been waiting a long time for it to be released on DVD, and now that it is, I'm probably not going to buy it, because of the episodes it's boxed with. The Blood Waters of Dr. Z is okay, but not exactly one of their best. The Crawling Eye is one of the very early episodes back when Josh Weinstein played Dr. Erhardt and voiced Tom Servo. I'm getting sick of Shout Factory including one of these in every box, because the show hadn't really gotten funny yet. The Beatniks I haven't seen. Maybe it's great and makes up for The Crawling Eye and Dr. Z, but I'm not counting on it."
1,Only for small seats!!!!,"Be Careful! I ordered these thinking they would be great, but they did not fit! I tried both in my mini van and my mini cooper. And the material and stitching are thin and weak, a slight stretch of the material caused an immediate ripping sound. Yikes! Anyways, I sent them back and only got refunded for 1 because of the tear! Total jip!"
1,CHEAP!!! and I don't mean the price,I would recommend against buying these seat covers. They are cheap and do not fit correctly. Upon trying to put them on I could hear ripping sounds and further when trying to connect the fitting loops they ripped and broke with little tension put on them. My advice would be to look for different seat covers.
5,Best $32 Spent!,"One of my co-workers has this ring from Tiffany's. I loved it so much, but wasn't ready to spend $250 on it. Instead, I found this ring from Eve's Addication. The ring size guide makes it easy to determine, which size to select. The ring came in a small blue velvet bag and matching box. It is .925 sterling silver, which is the same quality of Tiffany jewelry. The back is hollow so it is not solid, which does not bother me because no one ever sees it. I actually compared my ring to my co-worker's and you couldn't tell much difference! Eves Addiction also included a pair of CZ princess cut earrings since my purchase was more than $75 and I received free shipping. This is the best $32 I have spent!"
1,Patriahs and Prophets,"It was not the book I wanted it was Volume 2 in a series of books, but my second order was the book that My Mom wanted. Thank you."
3,A Great Value for the Casual Fan,"This may not be the greatest of the Rick Nelson collections, but it's a fun album and a great value at the price. All of the biggest hits are here, and the band is really tight. There are a few short but exceptional jams, especially on ""That's Alright Mama"" and ""Believe What You Say."" The only downside is Rick's voice. He's not in top-shape here, but he can reach most of the notes. On the other hand, the background vocals are terrific and cover for any shortcomings Rick might show. There's a particularly interesting version of ""It's Late."" I would have preferred a more expansive version of ""Fools Rush In""--it feels like he rushed through the song. Rick clearly shows more interest in the songs that weren't his teenage hits. Still, you can't go wrong if you're looking for a Rick Nelson sampler at an inexpensive price."
4,My boyfriend enjoyed it.,"My boyfriend loved playing guitar along with Jack. We like hearing his stories, especially, when Arlo Guthrie was talking to him."
1,Worthless,This book contains nothing but unadulterated psychobabble based on old psychological theories that no one respects anymore. I have read the book from cover to cover and did not find one word that was useful. I do have experience in counseling and believe this book will not help counselors to do their job any better.
1,Sorely Disappointed!,"Ordinarily, I do not review films. However, this one was SO bad - I feel compelled to warn others away. As background, I LOVE films like Devdas and Asoka, even Bride and Prejudice was fun. I was hoping this movie would fall in line with the feel good, Bollywood genre that I so love. That did not happen here! There was zero chemistry between Harry and his lady love, Teresa. The supporting cast couldn't even save this flick- Harry's father was a horrible cliche about fat, old men who have a thing for young, hot models. His mother was a bitter, unhappy harpy of a woman while his friends were walking dirtbags who wouldn't understand manogomy if it smacked them in their faces! Really, there was not a single redeeming facet to this mess of a film. Sorely Disappointed!!! Skip it, skip it, skip it!"
1,One star is generous...,"If you are looking for a fun Bollywood flick then THIS IS NOT IT. The acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and all the sensual innuendos are not at all what I was expecting from the previews. I couldn't finish it and had to turn it off. Stay away. Save your money."
3,Its ok for a low budget movie,"Its ok for a movie, but the theme behind it is good, its about marriage, old fashioned where the parents decide for you who to marry, or the new modern approach to marriage."
2,who will harry marry,I love Indie flicks and it had a taste of it with the colorful costumes and visits to India. The script was poor and those that stated a family movie??? It is not with main character's father being a womanizer for most of the flick.No..not a family flick. It could of been so much better both acting and script.I wish I would of read the other reviews because I wouldn't of bothered to rent.Do yourself a favor..and look for another movie. Wishing I rented a true Indie flick. oh...well.
1,VERY POOR OVERALL,"I donno who and why are rating this movie 5 stars!VERY POOR plot, storyline, and acting.Total garbage!Rahul, you are better off dancing!"
4,JERRY HERMAN'S FIRST SHOW ON BROADWAY,"A little rough, a little ethnic, but a good, solid score with good performances. Plus, the opportunity to hear the great Molly Picon. Hummable tunes and clever lyrics, always associated with Jerry Herman, are here in his first Broadway effort. Some of the selections are ponderous, but they can be forgiven - the others are wonderful."
1,Crude Writing and Concepts,"Don't waste your money on this title. The concepts are common sense and the text reads like an rambling under-grad term paper. There is nothing original here, or if there is, it faded away long ago."
5,An honest & understandable look at Online marketing,"Marcia Yudkin opened up many new doors for me with this book for online marketing. I gave me a quick broad understanding of the internet and the world of marketing online. I have since gone on to expand my knowledge by my own adventures online, but this book I read early on and it truly helped me get started. I managed to take a great deal of the data I learned in this book and apply it to my own business's new ventures online, and developed my own unique niche and identity for my website though some of the tidbits I found in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to learn some basics of online marketing."
5,Off the Hook....Cop this release!!!!,"This CD is the best independent CD i have ever heard. Jimmy's flow is relaxin n' mad tight. DRD ""my boy Mr. D"", drops mad phat beats. One love.....COP IT"
5,wiring harness,"Great product, cheap, plugged right in no problem, came in the allotted time and is in my jeep now. Saved time and money by buying it online."
4,Deja Vu all over again,"This is a great book. Written in '80 (pub date 81) it analyzes the underlying economy that gave rise to the late 70's 'stagflation'. It does not give a prescription for investing in such a period (which appears to be returning) but allows the astute reader to study the economic policies put in place in the 80's that ""cured"" the country.The author has a wonderful, positive voice that makes reading this economic text a pleasure."
4,Merman Hidden Treasure,"At first glance, this compilation would seem like yet another in the series of Merman collections from her work in the 1930s and 1940s. However, the hidden treasure here is that several of the cuts are taken from her studio album for Reprise, recorded in stereo in 1961. This was perhaps her best studio turn at the microphone, with driving arrangements by Billy May. Ethel is at her best vocally, and is the greatest presentation on CD of what made The Merm such a big star. At the low price, this is a real bargain!"
2,"Pale tiny print on non-white page, unreadable","When books of a spiritual purpose are sold via internet, readers will assume that the print on the page is readable. This books print is tiny, not black, but rather some diluted shade of gray. In short, unreadable.Doesn't Amazon want to purvey books that can be read without a microscope?Puffy cover is no excuse for being unreadable.I would not buy another publication from this publisher.Wanted to have the Alan Cohen book, wish I'd been warned before wasting money."
3,Decent,"Wish I could say I watched this video to the end but Rick is too nice and didn't hold my attention from other distractions. We love his books, their info, and his website but his videos could use a little more oomph. If you have time and a DVR, you can catch many of his shows on PBS."
5,RICK LOVES ITALY & IT SHOWS.,"If you are planning a trip to Italy, or, have already been and wish to experience the joys of this facinating country again, this is a great video. Rick loves the country and its people, and his joy and enthusism show throughtout the 4 hours on this dvd. The video takes the viewer to such 'biggies' as Venice, Rome and Florence. And it addition it takes you away from the tour-group crowds to experience less visited areas. The Hill Towns, Sicily and the wonderful Cinque Terre villages are among the other locations explored. Plus, the well-traveled host offers tips on transportation, food, language, hotels, meeting the people, and lots more - all aimed at helping the traveler in Italy to achieve maximum enjoyment during limited vacation time. My daughters and I have been in Italy the past two summers and found Rick's tips accurate and helpful. Wonderfully satisfying to view again upon returning."
3,Wearisome,"Multiple narrators and a non linear narrative in a rambling, disjointed remembrance, far from scintillating.Whether it be the translation or the original, The Axe is a wearisome novel - potentially of interest to any analysing ethical dilemmas of cadres and functionaries under communism but otherwise very forgettable.The brilliance of The Guinea Pigs is nowhere to be found here."
3,Worth Keeping,"This text provides a good, basic overview of methods for measuring several physical phenomena. The treatment of most of these is average. However, thermal measurement is given an improved, more thorough coverage. Personally, I have primarily used this text as a reference and guide for Chapter 3: Assessing and Presenting Experimental Data. I have found the sections on Error and, especially, Uncertainty to be very instructive and practical for use during college and post-graduation (as a mechanical engineer in research and development)."
2,Try another measurements book.,"This book was assigned to me as part of a college mechanical engineering course. This book was hard to follow and strayed from the course description. It contains aspects of electronics and mechanical design where the math problems are not fully explained and worked out and the machine descriptions are extremely brief. It is possible to get an education out this book, but a person would really have to strain. If you buy this book, I recommend that you get a generic study guide to accompany it."
3,Eh,This was just an okay book. It wasn't great by any means. Part of the problem was a bad professor so I had no desire to learn from this class anyway!
1,pathetic,This book is absolutely useless for college level students. It DOES NOT explains problems in detail and you would have to spend hours in understanding what they are trying to do.Absolutely CRAPY book. I WONT recomment this to anyone
4,Close but not Quite,"Sound quality is nice and the cabinetry is well designed; however, the remote lacks a few essential features as well as the LCD on the CD player leaves room for improvement. The remote does not have the ability to power on and off the CD player making it only somewhat helpful in remotely adjusting your CD listening, but not fully featured. Another disadvantage is that the LCD screen is not as clear as you would want and for a dim room the angle of clear viewing is slim at best. The best way to get this product is in a bundle... Don't misunderstand the review though, this is a nice product, but don't think that there are not a few shortcomings."
1,Would have gotten a higher rating if it worked at all,"I would imagine it was the cheap, crummy power supply, but mine wouldn't even light up...dead...One wonders why a $200 component can't run on 110 volts? I'd try it again if they re-worked the power supply, but not if I have to use a DC adapter like a $3 item."
2,Problems Problems Problems,"This is a great idea: a small CD player to match the rest of the Tivoli line. Unfortunately, the quality of the units I tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the Tivoli line. All in all, Tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems: one wouldn't play the disc, one wouldn't eject the disc, one had an LED readout that would go blank, and one had variations on all of these problems. The Model One is a great product and the PAL and the others are close behind, but the Model CD needs a lot more work."
2,Sounds Great / Looks Great - When it Works...,"My first Model CD would not play extended play CDs. I contacted Tivoli, and they very graciously sent a new version of the player that resolved that software problem. I received a new one, which didn't play at all. Called them up again, and they very graciously sent a new player with a pre-paid return slip. The new one they sent worked for about a week and has since stopped playing. I'm very sad about this, and though the people at Tivoli were so helpful, I'm not sure I'm going to continue owning this product."
5,Just what we wanted,"My brother and I were looking to replace our mother's broken CD player. We wanted something that looked and sounded good and that was also easy to use. Finding something with the last attribute, simplicity of use, without giving up the first two attributes was the hard part. The Tivoli CD player was ideal: One CD only, play-pause-stop, forward-back, that's it, and that is all that is necessary - and it is very attractive and sounds great. It was the perfect gift - she loves it."
3,"It is warm, but the pockets are limited and the zippers stick","Someone else posted that they run large, so I purchased the short and it fit perfectly. I am 5' 9"" and 178 lbs. Besides the sticking zippers, I found the snaps along the legs to be totally unusable. They are just too hard to snap.The pockets are like regular side pant pockets. They are tight. For me, this is a problem because I like to put my 2-way police radio in a pocket when I walk the dog.Besides those complaints, I find it comfortable and warm and I do wear it frequently on colder days. We haven't had much snow yet, so I cannot be sure how it will handle when wet."
2,Size,"The size. The inseam was 26 inches. Stated 30.The waist to shoulder was to long.the crotch hung down,had bund over to reach the pocket."
4,Waiting for the cold weather,"I purchased this for cold weather riding on my motorcycle. The cold weather has not yet begun, so I do not yet know for sure how warm it will keep me. However, the fit is good (I am 5'9"" and 180 lbs.) and there is a little extra room for additional layering should I need it. I can move comfortably in it and the zippers and snaps all work very well. From what I can see so far, I think it will do the job I need it to do."
2,"Nice, if it worked right","If you can get a fully working item, this is a nice TV for the money. However, I've had two and returned them both. Both had problems with loud squealing or buzzing inside the cabinent. The second also had geometry problems. The lower left corner picture was noticably bent. I'd have to recommend avoiding this model, or at least be sure you can return it."
1,Worst Ever - Stay Away,"The Phillips 27PT643R is the worst television ever based on over 10 televisions I have brought in the past decade. This television craped out on me in a 2 1/2 months prior to the factory warranty expiration of 90 Days. The tv auto shutsoff in 10 minutes. Took 10 days to schedule an appointment with a Phillips Technician. When onsite, Phillips Technician was unable to repair it. So he brought it back to the Factory Store. It's over 3 weeks and the television have not been repaired. I called every 3 days and they told me that it's 'in transit'. Since I got my Television on November 29, 2003, half of the time is in the shop. As of now, I still have not gotten my television back. Just today when I call in, the customer service rep told me that the parts is in back order. It's not in transit. Go figures. First Phillips Television. It will be my last Phillips Television. Stay away from Phillips Television if I were you!"
3,A terrible translation of a beautiful play,"Friedrich Dürrenmatt's play Der Besuch der alten Dame is a milestone in German language drama, one of the most significant pieces in the twentieth century. The Maurice Valency ""adaptation"" is barely a suggestion of the original. Obviously some things must be lost in the translation, but Valency makes unjustifiable decisions: entire scenes are excised, a great deal of dialogue has been trimmed from scenes that didn't need it, Valency has written his own scenes in, he's moved things around, and then on top of all of that he changed the main character's name for reasons that elude me. If at all possible, find another translation of this play, whether you intend to perform it or just to read it; the Valency version is a sin."
2,Difficult to get my child in to jumper on my own.,"I find it very difficult to get my son in by myself, however he loves jumping in it. I have since purchased the Graco Jumpster and like it much better."
4,not bad,"Worth $75? Not really, I dont think so. $50? Probably. All the jumpers we found were only up to 25 lbs, this one is max at 28 lbs. So its not a huge advantage, but when you have a 7 month old at 23 lbs, you dont want to spend $75 for him to only use it for 2 more pounds. But 4 stars cause it could be just a tad larger (from top of head, to blue bar over top his head) and over all height (big baby) cause theres not much room for adjustment since hes already 29 inches long. But he absolutly LOVES it."
4,Great fun. Few suggestions...,"Great jumper, easy to ensemble.Big frame that makes switching rooms difficult. It's not easy to break down.That said...My baby loves it and it is safe. Lots of fun for baby and you! Gives baby independence to watch, turn, observe, jump etc. my baby is entertained for 30 min easily.A jumper of dome sort is a must buy! I've used doorway jumpers with trays with my last baby and i prefer them. But this is a good jumper if you have the space and don't mind a giant white bar in site!"
3,"Not for ""reading"" but worth the examples for a quickstart","A bit ""gratuitous"" in it's example scripts followed by line-by-line, over-explained annotation of the scripts; the ""introduction"" to applescript is tedious; but for those with some prior context and the need to get a quick-bead on applescript, the samples can be ""tried"", ""modified"" and further ""glorified"" to your heart's content.At this price, the sample scripts pay the freight."
2,"Lots of examples, but not a good tutorial","I'm very unhappy with this book. I've done tons of scripting in many other languages and after reading this book, I still am unable to write an Applescript to do the simplest task. The first few chapters are for stupids and the rest of the book is all examples - many of which may not apply to you since they are about specific applications. Definitely look at this book in a bookstore before buying online to see if it will work for you or if it will be as useless as it has been to me."
4,Wish it Had More...,"I really wish this book had more material to offer. Nevertheless, I found that this book had most comprehensive material on MacOS 9 era of scripts. I needed something to get started on older Mac OS 9 supported desktops, and this book helped immensely.Some of the cool highlights that there was coverage of configuring OpenTranspot (TCP, AppleTalk), which is great for IT folks, coverage of adding user interface with FaceSpan, and using email programs like Outlook Express or Eudora Pro."
3,So so. I'll know more when I finish this book.,"On page 20, Item 4 should read: Set item 4 of k to ""me"" . On page 29 Code 3.2 after end repeat should read: get myList . If you don't make this correction, you'll never see ""the result"" and you'll quit in frustration. I've had this book for only a few hours, but these mistakes on the first 15 pages of code don't bode well."
2,"Waste of time, won't teach you much.",This book is mostly lame examples. Who needs to script the TCP/IP control panel? Even if you find something usefull in it you'll never find it again because the index is so scimpy.
3,nothing special,the fact that none of the exercises have solutions is bothersome. i also had difficulty determining which ideas/equations have more emphasis than others. this book shouldn't be used as an introductory course due to its mediocre-at-best layout.
1,Bad presentation,"This book explains linear programming concepts using tableaus. Tableaus are obsolete. If you want to solve a linear program, you use Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, GNU Octave or some other computer program. If you want to understand the simplex algorithm, you should study the linear algebra approach, and not tableaus.The book is badly organized, the font is ugly and the theory is spread over zillions of examples. Definitions are hard find. The algorithms are presented in a very cumbersome manner. The exercises are so many you don't bother even to read them. I would be nicer with a few, carefully selected, exercises.The book would not be nice for an introductory course since everything is presented in such an obfusacted way. For a second course, it's not useful either, since instead of solid theory it contains only the mentioned zillions of examples."
1,American Legend: Hank Williams,"This product is a sham! The CD purports to be songs written and sung by Hank Williams, when in fact most of the songs are sung by other ""artists,"" none of whom compare will Williams. Three songs are by Willaims and the others sung by various other singers. The quality of the recordings is good but it was a great disappointment to hear lesser singers attempt these songs, some of which are rare, such as ""Singing waterfall""--I ordered the cd because of this song, which is sung by a woman, whose interpretation is nothing like Williams', nor is the instrumental interpretation of the music itself. Beware, Beware!!"
3,Slight burning,"Nia 24 Sun Damage Prevention 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 applies smoothly without streaking. It takes some rubbing to get rid of the ""white look"" on your face. My wife has red-brown hair, blue eyes, and pink skin and I have red-blonde hair, blue eyes, and a florid complexion and both of us noted a slight burning to our cheeks shortly after facial application. For me, this subsided after a few minutes with no further discomfort. As for my wife, the discomfort lasted somewhat longer. As far as sun protection goes, it worked as advertised. I am not sure where the slight burning came from as mineral based sunscreens with titanium or zinc salts should have far less adverse skin reactions than the chemically based ones. Still, I think it is a good sunscreen with no major problems but I would not put it at the top in its category."
1,Horrible :-(,"After reading reviews on this I was really excited to try it. Unfortunately I do not like it at all. After putting it on it leaves a ""powdery"" feel on your skin. I think I will stick with the spray cans of sunblock."
1,Not a Good Choice,"After reading many favorable reviews about this sun product, I decided to try it. Unfortunately when I applied the cream to my face I noticed my skin became much redder than usual. I tried it again on a different day and the same thing happened. A friend of mine who is a dermatologist told me it was because of the niacin--some people who are very sensitive to it will have a red, inflammatory reaction and should not use any product containing it. When I called the company to ask about a refund, they told me they could not refund my purchase because I had opened the container.Of course, I'm now saying to myself, ""How else would I know that I couldn't use it??"", but the woman was very curt, abrupt and didn't have anything else to add. Never again will I order any make-up- style product from a company I've never heard of. Sephora would have readily taken it back--no questions asked--just show us the receipt. My loss this time ($50)--never again."
5,Fantastic sunscreen!,"I love this sunscreen. It goes on great, doesn't clog up my pores and actually makes my skin look better. And they don't test on animals, which is a biggie for me. So this is a thumbs up all around!"
3,It's okay,"I've used this for about two weeks, I don't know if it is working or not but don't like the white residue left in my wrinkles."
3,Nia24 Sunscreen,It was hard to get the white look to disappear. It burned my skin a little bit. I use retinol and that may have contributed to that.
3,"Beware, the tube has shrunk","I have been buying NIA24 each spring for about four years. It has always come in a 3.4 ounce size. What a shock this year when it arrived and the tube looked so small. It looks smaller, because is is smaller. The tube is now 2.5 ounces. Since I wasn't expecting the size to change, I didn't check my old tube to see how many ounces it was. The product is wonderful, but I am not happy paying more money this year than last year, and getting less product. NIA24 deserves five stars, but I give it only three stars due to the surprise of the smaller tube."
2,Definitely not fragrance free,"I purchased this product because it is labeled as fragrance free. Upon opening it I was overwhelmed with a perfumy smell. I called the company and questioned them. They told me that what I smell is called a ""masking agent"", to cover the bad chemical smell of the product. It smells like strong perfume to me, so I'm not sure what the definition of a ""masking agent"" is. Whatever it is, it is not fragrance free. It seems like very deceitful advertising to me."
2,King Arthur,"I usually enjoy King Arthur/Merlin stories. I was very disappointed in this book, however. IThis book is boring, boring, boring."
3,"A bit slow, but it's good :-)","This book was a bit hard to read because of the language, and I found also that it is a bit slow. Still it is a good read."
1,Arthur - not the one I want to read,"Camelot is currently one of my obsessions. So I read this in the hope that it might be more historically relevant than some of the fantasy series I've been reading. It isn't. I'd rather tackle Mallory head on. Personally, I thinkLancelot And The Wolf, the Knights of Camelot, captures the essence of Arthur, Lancelot and co with much more verve and vigour. It is certainly more entertaining. I'm sorry but I was disappointed by this book."
3,Fair,"Found the old English interfered with the flow of the tale, otherwise was a fair reflection of the accepted versions of this period"
2,Do not know what you want here.,The old english was a bit slow to read.0K OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK .
3,Not as good as the movies,"The story seems to go from event to event to event, (not really the same as the stories you have seen repeatedly in the movies) with limited connectedness between them. I wanted to know the whole story, as I enjoy the Arthur stories in every version I have seen, but much prefer the movie rewrites over the book, which is completely off for me."
2,much is lacking,"There is no personality development of any of the characters! It's basically just a dry reporting of jousts and battles - non-stop slaughter & cruelty, leaving me wondering why it's recommended as a children's version (or how there were any men - or horses - left at all after such goings-on). The Arthurian legends are fascinating, but there are many more detailed and interesting versions than this one."
5,Literature at its' finest!,"I have loved these stories since I was a child, and I take great pleasure in handing them down to my own children. I highly-recommend this!"
3,The Legends of King Arthur and his Knights.,"Too much violence contained for me. It was not what I expected to read. True to how they lived thier lives back then, but too raw for my liking."
2,King Arthur,It was overall an okay book. It was very confusing at times and the ending did not make any sense.
2,This version sucks,When I was still in grammar school I read the legend of king Arthur. This book skips to many details including the tales of the colored knights and how Arthur came by Lancelot. Pass on this poor rendition.
5,Incredible music,"Lee Galloway's rendition of Canon in D is worth the entire CD's price. I have never heard a better rendition, and, if the other songs are anything like the Canon in D, this is one very wonderful work of music."
4,Spider Sparrow - Great book for everyone!,Spider Sparrow was a great book. I only wish Spider could have lived longer because he had something special about him. Everyone would enjoy this book - kids or adults!
3,GOOD BUT SAD ENDING,THIS BOOK WAS VERY GOOD I LIKE HOW SPIDER PARENTS WHERE HAPPY THERE SON COULD NOT BE SENT TO WAR BUT THEY WE SAD HHE WAS NOT NORMAL.THE NDING KIND OF SADDEDEN ME I WISH IT COULD OF HAD A HAPPY ENDING.
5,Blast from the past!,"This was actually the first CD I ever purchased back in the 80's. I listened to all of the songs over and over and liked most of the songs on this album. I bought it because of the song ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" but there are a few other catchy tunes."
2,"Babylon, the only song I like on it","and that is only because Im a Grace Slick fan.She could sing the phone book and Id love it.This song was performed awesome at Radio City Music Hall when I saw her in the Summer of '87.Her voice soared there on that song but was obvious she wasnt comfortable being ""an old person on a rock and roll stage"".Her Dad was very ill at the time and passed soon after."
4,Overlooked band that rocks... what's new?,"After buying the Life & Times EP I decided to check out this band. (Since John Meredith plays bass in TLAT). I was really blown away with this album. I didnt expect to like it at first, but it rocks. The whole band works so well together and even though they are a 3 piece you couldn't tell from the excellent musicianship. The time changes are a little strange at first but they make the songs so unique. The chord progession in ""Live Through This Record"" is just beautiful. Highlights include ""The sun will burnout"", ""Live Through This Record"", and ""Not Ok Computer"". This band has so much potential but I have heard that they have since broken up."
2,Do it yourself: no need for this book,"I have not read this book,but if you are really serious about arbitrage you should be able to write a program, that simulates the Black-Sholes model using discrete mathematics and random walk.In short, you should be able to, from first principles, derive all you need to know about arbitrage.But for those of you that prefer canned solutions, this book is OK I suppose."
2,Not Very Good,"This text was purchased for a newly developed 400-level advanced organic chemistry course (the professor had been teaching the two semesters of regular organic chemistry for years, and is an excellent instructor).About six weeks (or maybe less) into the semester, the instructor dumped the book and taught the rest of the class from her own notes, apologizing profusely to the students for the sorry excuse of a textbook. (But this was not her fault, and she did a great job of rescuing the class from the frustration of attempting to use this confusing and dismal text, and proceeding on with the course.)I would not recommend that anyone select this text for the study of advanced organic chemistry."
2,Door is Hard to Open,"This lid comes on and off the tank easily, but the little sliding door sticks almost every time I try to open it (seems like a design flaw, not just my particular unit). It does provide nice ventilation (I use it for a hamster cage.)"
2,The Life of William Gladstone.,"This is the political life story of the Grand Old Man of British politics (GOM). William E. Gladstone certainly did influence British politics for over fifty years, and was elected to the Prime Minister position four times. This short book (or thesis) explained his political development through those fifty years. He moved from a Conservative on social issues to that of a Liberal or even Radical position. His championship of Irish Home Rule kept Ireland within the British Empire for thirty more years. This man and his political position kept the radical left from many popular positions.The unfortunate part of this book is that it reads like a thesis. It probably was a thesis and as such will not attract much interest from the general public. I did learn a great deal about this most influencial of British politicians."
4,Works as expected,Had the drive for a short period of time and works as expected. Easy installation and fast.
2,Confessions of St Augustine,"The delievery came on time, but the item was not a good choice. The box only contained the cds and a table of contents or written guide was not provided of what book was on each cd.I had no idea which apologetics I was listen to and not sure if the item was missing or the producers never provided one. Needless to say, I did not use it! Now it just sits on my shelf. :("
2,"Review of the edition, not of the work","This review addresses not the work itself, but this particular edition of it.First, the translation uses older English words to which I am unaccustomed. E.g. Thee, Thy, knoweth, hast, Thou art, etc. Speaking for myself, I wanted to dive into the material right away and having to mentally translate the material into modern English is an obstacle.Secondly, this edition does not display the chapter headings as in other (paper) editions. I hoped to use this edition for meditation, but because the material is presented in large and undifferentiated chunks, (and needs to be mentally translated as noted above), I see that this edition will not suit my purpose.For those readers accustomed to older English language and interested in the work as a whole, this edition will probably work fine."
4,But which edition is this supposed to be?,"Readers of this page will note that it is utterly confused. The details of date of publication and information of 'limited availability' imply that this is the first printing of the classic F.J. Sheed translation. But the 'Book Description' and some of the reviews attached relate instead to the Chadwick translation first published in 1991. Amazon's habit of copying reviews -- and in this case books descriptions as well -- onto different editions of what is supposed to be the same book leads to confusion when, as here, we are dealing with quite different editions and translations.My 4 stars relate to the 1943 Sheed translation, which I consider to be still the best, but I would advise getting the new revised edition (edited by M.P. Foley and with a new introduction by Peter Brown), chiefly because it gives both systems of chapter numeration."
3,DISAPPOINTING OPTIMIZATION,"The claim of being ""optimized"" for Kindle is misleading. There is no Table of Contents, so if you want to read a given chapter, as I was assigned to do, you have to guess at about what page number it may be, and then page forward or backward until you find it.The book itself is interesting enough, and worth examining, since it presents the thinking of one of the early intellectual leaders of the Christian Faith."
5,Excellent,THe book gives much t6o think about. Supports our faith.Not a particular easy read but well worth the time and effort.
3,St Augustine,I wish that I was smart enough to follow this Book. I don't have the attention span for this King James type writing but God Bless thoes who do.
1,horrible,"Bernard Mayes mutilates the reading of this wonderful book. He sounds like Gollum from the Lord of the Rings. His reading is just horrible. Some word pronouncements are barely audible, the sounding of the letter s, makes it sound like he has some teeth missing. I am continually having to adjust my sound dial as he is up and down with the sound of his voice. I have no idea why blacstone audio went with this guy."
5,An informed and informative descriptive analysis of Chinese capitalism as practiced today,"In China And Socialism: Market Reforms And Class Struggle, co-authors Martin Hart-Landsberg (Professor of Economics, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon) and Paul Burkett (Professor of Economics, Indiana State University) provide the non-specialist general reader with an informed and informative descriptive analysis of Chinese capitalism as practiced today. Chapters cover China's economic transformation, as well as contradictions both domestic and international to this transformation. Tables, figures, and a wealth of research back the history, theories, and projects with solid data. A ""must-read"" especially for political scientists, economists, and businessmen seeking to better understand the changes that continue revolutionize China's economic model to this day."
5,Excellent Stuff,"This is the type of Rommony music one hunts all over the place for. A rare find. Good, rowsing, earthy stuff with excellent instrumentation."
4,"Undeniably romantic, yet somewhat disappointing read","No question. This tale of love between two lost souls is very sweet. Olivia Bond feels unworthy of love because of the year she spent as Darcy Lankanal's sex toy. Reclusive Noah LaCroix feels unworthy of love because of his severe facial scars. When Noah rescues Olivia after she gets lost in the swamp while on the run from Darcy, they begin to care for each other. Wonderful idea, yet two things bothered me. First, two such appealing characters in a romance novel deserve far more in the way of a sexual pay-off. More should have been made of Noah's loss of virginity. The build-up in tension between Olivia and Noah was never given a decent outlet. Second, and more serious, the last part of the book spent way too much time on Darcy and a shaky attempt to clean up his image in preparation for a novel of his own. I'm sorry, Jill, but Darcy is no hero."
3,Interesting characters and setting but...,"Set in the 1820's when Illinois is on the frontier, Blue Moon has the potential to explore some new territory in the romance genre. For starters, the main characters are a refuge from a brothel and a man described as the ""oldest living virgin in the territory."" The obstacles to their love (because there must always be obstacles) are even fairly original. And certainly, Landis can write a terrific romance (Sunflower and Come Spring are permanent members of my keeper shelf). Somehow, it doesn't all quite come together in Blue Moon. I'd lay the blame on too much time spent on the threat posed by Darcy, the brothel owner. The time could have been better spent on more interaction between Olivia and Noah.Also worth noting, this book is the sequel/spin-off to ""Just Once."" I went out of my way to read them in order but that probably isn't necessary to understanding and enjoying Blue Moon."
5,Excellent and original... I couldn't put it down!!!,"I've always been a big fan of historical romances, it's about 95% of what I read, for some reason those times capture me and I can imagine being there myself. After reading this book I couldn't stop talking about it and nearly drove my husband crazy with my enthusiasm about the originality of this book. If you like historical romances and you're looking for something that's different from your typical characters (who in most other romances almost always seem to be the same people in my opinion) this is what you need. Jill Marie Landis did a great job. This was the first book of hers that I've read and I'm looking forward to reading more of her works! An excellent read!!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped...,"I am usually a sucker for romances with men that are the outcasts in some way, so when I read the reviews for this book, I thought I would love it. However, I found it fairly predictable. I found the main female character rather dull actually, and I didn't find the obsessed pimp character all that believable either."
2,Not my favorite,"This book seemed to have so much potential but it just didn't come through for me. I'm just not sure if it was the writing style or the characters but I was left with the feeling, that was it? Then at the very end he takes Livvey away from her family that REALLY needs her, to live in a swamp and have lots of babies?? Come on! What was wrong with building their own little cabin over by the woods and stream? Why not live near the people that love her? It's not like he had anything actually waiting for him in the swamp, Noah was very selfish and self centered. I just hope all those babies sprout wings or they are in for more heartbreak."
2,Buy Gottinger's book instead,"This is a very interesting book that covers the full range of network industries - and is in many ways a welcome addition to the literature.However, I found the pitch of the book to be not quite right. In an attempt to satisfy a student market, the presentation is a little simplistic in places. Although there are IO courses everywhere, there are few solely devoted to network industries - so it is surprising that the publishers risked producing a paperback.As a consumer, the price of Professor Shy's book is an appealing factor, but I found Hans Gottinger's far more up-to-date, rigorous and analytical book of the same title (Routledge, 2003) more stimulating."
3,"Decent price, but not without problems","I purchased two of these microphones as part of my PC karaoke setup, and while pleased with the price as well as the feel of the microphone, I encountered problems with microphone loudness - the mircophone is just not that loud. Even with the input volume maxed out, you have to put your lips right against the mic and speak fairly loudly for it to register.I tested the mic on multiple computers and compared it to other microphones (namely the headset that came with Dragon Naturally speaking) just to be sure it wasn't specific to the Karaoke PC and had the same results."
1,Horrible,"This book is awful. I had to force myself to finish it. The author spends an inordinate amount of time describing events and characters that actually have very little to do with the story. The main characters are not developed nearly enough. There was a lot of potential in the character of Jack Miller, but he was, ultimately a disappointment, as was the entire book. this book sucks. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Definate runner up for the worst movie of all time,"The all too often out of breath American militia Leader (Dan Haggerty) gives a painfully mind numbing performance as an uninspiring Military Captain during the revolutionary war. Rick Washburn also joins this rag-tag team as a British Commander attempting to provide some comic relief but ultimately leaves you begging for relief from this hopeless movie. On the back of the DVD it says it is much akin to the spirit and theme of Dances with Wolves and to which I can only respond by quoting the ninth commandment, ""Thou shalt not bear false witness"". Heaven help us all that this movie may never find its way into our DVD players. It's only saving grace is that it's rated PG. If you have children that you don't mind making dumber, buy this movie for them. It's a great sedative."
1,Good plot - one of the worst acted movies I've ever seen.,"I paid $5.00 for this movie. I am trying to figure out if I can at least reuse the disk for a road reflector.Honestly, The script could have been good, But I just can not get past the poorest acting and filming I have ever seen.As a Native American, I can appreciate the sediment it is trying to convey, but it just misses the mark for reality."
3,Don't look forward to much...,The acting is pitiful in this movie. The story could have been better. There is some language but for the most part it can be a family movie. I don't recommend it though. It just does give much for entertainment!
2,Not much more than a writing exercise...,"While I appreciate the attempts to entertain, these were not much more than empty story lines and characters which failed to entice me into wanting to know more about them."
5,excelente,"Muy buen producto, fácil explicación y bonito para llevar siempre puesto. Fue muy buena esta compra"
2,I had no idea I am an elite athlete! (cough cough),"This is probably the monitor the President used to determine his heart rate is that of an elite athlete because I can't seem to record more than 35 bpm (in spite of having a resting pulse of around 60). Well, except for the time it told me my resting heart rate was 135. I tried applying vaseline as others have mentioned but still can't seem to get an accurate reading. Recommendation for the manual says to make sure the strap is snug but it has to be uncomfortably snug for me to get a reading at all. I've tried all sorts of tricks and re-read the manual several times but appear left with a bulky (thick) digital watch."
2,Inconsistent Heart Rate Readings,The watch is okay but the heart rate monitor is anything but accurate. 240 bpm is a regular reading for me. I have tried water and heart rate monitor electrode cream. At times it is accurate but there are too many times when it isn't and I spend my time trying to get an accurate reading.
5,"Years later and still working like a ""clock"" - Very Durable","I'm proud to say that I was reviewing my purchase history on Amazon and that I purchased this watch such a long time ago and I still love it and that it still works to perfection. I'm a runner and use it all the time, it is light, simple, stylish and it is still like new even though I bought it so long ago."
3,review on heartrate monitor,It wasn't clear until I got it that it was designed for women - the description as provided should be clearer.
3,It's for girls,"Silly me -- the word Midsize did not register. When I got it, it was easy to see that it was a GIRLIE watch. Amazon was good with the return/refund process, though. Then I ordered a watch for a DUDE."
2,Midsize? Not in my book!,"IF this is midsize, a toyota corolla is a luxury car! This is a small watch and because of that it is difficult to use. The chest band is barely adequate for a man with a 44inch chest, the watch band is short and NOT replaceable. The controls are small, sequences complicated and hard to use. It does appear to be accurate for land aerobics (why I gave it 2 stars) but NOT when swimming (apparently the water interferes with the chest sensor.)"
3,Iron Man Watch,This product is extremely difficult to figure out. I can't understand the directions. It has many features but no one I know can figure how to use them. I am looking for someone who has this watch who can help me. It seems to be reliable and keeps time. . . but the rest I have yet to figure out.
2,"inaccurate, poor strap","I am a fairly serious runner; I run 50 miles/per week. I bought this HRM as a basic model to monitor my training. I've been using it for two or three months now.Pros: Decent looking watch, 30-lap function, easy to set up and use.Cons: The actual heart rate strap you wear around your chest is very uncomfortable and does not have a secure and easy to use fastening system. Furthermore, when I review my data after a run, 9/10 times it registers my max HR as hitting 240. Obviously, this is wrong.Would not recommend this one."
2,Poor calorie counter,"It is stylish, it is comfortable, but it NOT and accurate calorie counter. For a 30 minute walk with an average HR of 140 bpm, it calculated a calorie expenditure of 366 calories. Oh, that it were so! I contacted Timex customer service, who actually gave me the formula for how they calculate calories burned. The formula and the HRM gave entirely different numbers. I was pleased with how it measured HR only. If you are looking for a HRM only with no calorie counter, it's OK. If you want an accurate calorie counter, look further."
3,Button fell out!,"Product worked as described; however, on my second day of owning the watch the STP/RST button fell out while I was riding my trainer.I was able to find the small black button on the carpet and place it back into the watch but it won't stay in. I have since shipped this back to Amazon and re-ordered another Timex with a different styling...On the plus side, the HRM and Watch features worked as expected. I am guessing that as with everything, there is a certain % of defects in manufacturing, and I just got unlucky..."
5,THE VOICE is amazing,"Was making a compilation CD and uncovered this CD and TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE also by Mavis and Prince.Both CDs are exceptional and couldnt help but think PINK is doing now, what Mavis and Prince were doing in 1989 and 90!Find them! They ROCK!"
1,Side by side TV [VHS],"I bought a Side by Side TV $48.20. But I received only one tape of ""Demo Video"".As of July 27, 2010, I have not yet received refund from Carod 60."
2,just OK,"I ordered this DVD thinking I could learn some new moves for the Body Bar that I recently purchased. Upon watching the workout for the first time, I learned that I needed sliding disks to follow along with the workout. I managed to improvise and used paper plates on my carpeted floor for a similar sliding effect, but overall, it was more of an annoyance to try to do the same workout without the proper equipment. They should either include the disks with the DVD or make it very clear that the workout involves the Body Bar AND the slidling disks.As for the workout itself, it was OK, pretty challenging, but I was not really into it and had different expectations."
3,Was this paid for by McDonald's?,"I got the impression this movie was sponsored by McDonald's. Their images appeared there so many times and the entire first half was just to counter the negative publicity done by ""Supersize Me"".The info. in the second half was pretty good and some parts were humorous, but I still got left feeling like I'd watched a long commercial for McDonald's."
1,Not worth anyone's time.,"First off, my complaint is not about the premiss of this documentary, yes you can eat fast food and still be healthy, and that yes you do need fats in your diet. The problems that I have with this horrible film is all about the presentation. Our narrator/film maker is a whinny self righteous suburbanite talking down to me then entire film. To be convincing, I have to like you, Tom failed right from the start. The writing is substandard, the facts are thin, any arguments from the 'experts' are at best, a reach and very very poorly threaded together. I could have dealt with the home-made aspects of the film if it was worth watching, but the crummy camera work just grated on me. Sadly the only reasoning that I can see for Tom Naughton to make this movie is not an altruistic effort on his part to make my life better, it seems that for him he just wanted to make a movie to say that Super Size Me was stupid.This movie is not worth any one's time."
1,It's not funny!!!,"I couldn't finish watching the whole documentary on Netflix instant play. What a waste of my time. Tom has his points but I am not buying them. How would I know he was not manipulating his weights by exercising or eating diet pills off the camera if he thinks Morgan Spurlock was manipulating his weights as well. Personally, every time I eat at McDonald's, the food just made me sluggish. It's not good and quality food and we all know it as a fact. People eat at McDonald's only because they don't want to spend too much money on eating out, but still want to eat out. Mr. Tom Naughton, it is your choice to eat fast food, even though you claim it actually helps you lose weights. Best of luck living your life being sluggish and cranky. Meanwhile, I will stay away from fast food chains as much as possible. Clean and healthy eating is the only way to go to live a good life."
5,good,"took a little longer than i expected to receive the dvd but otherwise no problems with the service. this was a good movie which was a bit low budget, but once you get past that it's very informative and challenging. kudos to the director."
3,Couldn't get through it all,"It was an OK Documentary. Basically bashing ""Super Size me."" I was hoping it would be more informational, but it was basically an argument. I didn't finish it, well I couldn't."
5,Great Job,What a wonderful combination of health giving information and entertainment. Everyone should know about this
2,Flawed Logic,"Tom Naughton enjoys a month of eating fast food while improving his personal biometrics. He goes on to tell us that eating fast food isn't bad for us. Later he goes on to say we Americans eat out too much and consume far too many calorie from fast food. So let me get this straight...Tom can eat fast food for an entire month and improve his biometrics, but we eat too much fast food as a nation which is why we are over weight. Huh? Tom also shows us how it is next to impossible to take in too many calories at a fast food restaurant. He contradicts himself a lot and I just don't understand his logic. Perhaps my favorite line is one he borrows from author Gary Taubes...""We aren't fat because we eat, we eat because we are fat"".I too improved my biometrics in a very short time, but I took the radical approach of eating vegetables and fruits and cut out any animal products."
5,Challenging institutionalized nutritional beliefs,"The subject of nutrition is presented in this video in a light-hearted and straight-forward way. It starts off a bit slow, but it soon gets to the facts and opinions regarding influence of fat and carbs in our diet on our health and weight. It exposes the guilty parties, that have caused suffering and death of American public. It shows the evidence as to what substances the human body needs to stay healthy and lean.This video is recommended viewing to anyone with metabolic syndrome, struggling with weight or someone wondering what facts tell us about *proper* human nutrition."
1,Skip the first half of this movie.,"The nutrition info in this movie is pretty on point, but it was almost negated by the downplay of the obesity epidemic and an incessant rant on Morgan Spurlock... Yea, we get it; our government along with media sensationalism has betrayed us. Are we then supposed to pardon negligent business practices?... It seemed like Tom Naughton (the writer/ director of this movie) felt somehow personally attacked by the accusation that the Fast Food industry has played a part in the surging health problems we face in America. How about not turning this into a whiny political movie about your right to eat fries and cut to the chase about finding a solution. Btw, based on the attitude this guy has about food addiction, I really doubt he's even read Gary Taubes' book.Since you can't edit Tom Naughton's meal plan segments and annoying commentary out of this movie, i'd suggest just skipping to the more substance-based 2nd half."
5,The Best Intro to Healthy Nutrition,"Fat Head is the best resource to introduce people to paleo and low-carb ideas. It is especially valuable for exposing the error-ridden conventional wisdom, and for showing how political incentives distorted the science and led us down the low-fat dead-end. In addition to being highly informative, the video is funny and enjoyable to watch. Give this DVD to people you care about. It makes a great gift."
5,Great way to get the point across,"I was amused by Tom Naughton's rebuttal to Morgan Spurlock's annoying movie SuperSize Me. He pointed out so many of the things Spurlock did in order to ""prove"" fast food made you fat within the time period he gave. Even more important, was showing he could lose weight by eating fast food for the same amount of time simply by smart choices, without eating just salads and started walking a bit more. He showed why watching your carbs rather than fat would help you eat healthier, lose weight, feel better, even be more satisfied with what you did eat. He did not lower his carbs to an extreme amount. He kept them around 100g a day, more or less. His health actually improved while eating nothing but fast food during that time. He even showed the science behind it."
4,An interesting rebutle to supersize me.,"I'll admit that some of the humor was a bit obnoxious, but you don't usually watch a documentary for laughs. The first half is a bit slow (and I would seriously advise skipping the way to long CSPI guy bit! Sad, sad attempt at humor) but the second half has some excellent information not only on the roles of fats and starches but also on how they help or harm the body. Most fitness and weight books and videos try to over simplify the bodies processes, like the whole ""calories in, calories out"" system. The system descriptions in this video are more detailed than most while still being simple enough to understand. Over all I really enjoyed it. I think I'll try a diet based on these concepts, however I'll cut out all the fast food places (I don't like the meat they use or where it comes from) and do it home cooked, with naturally grown products. I will update later.Overall, I thought it was pretty great."
5,fathead review,I gave this video 5 stars because it really opened my eyes to nutrition. I first watched this movie on netflix about a year ago and I've been cutting trans fats and carbs and eating saturated fat and vegetables still to this day. I've been under my average weight I feel fantastic. This movie reveals how health-threatening lies can become common place myths in out society because money is involved. First half of the movie is a bit slow but sets the scene for the second half which is packed with valuable health/nutrition information. I've had to watch this film at least 6 times to absorb everything fully.
5,Great Viewing!,"This is s great documentary done in a somewhat humorous way. This does a good job debunking the ""scam"" that has been perpetrated on the general population regarding ""what's good for you to eat"". The ""food pyramid"" (should be inverted), the Center for Science in the Public Interest (not science, just a stealth-vegan organization), and, of course, the alleged documentary ""Supersize Me"" are all debunked. And, Naughton's conclusions work for me......"
2,If you hate Super Size Me you will love this movie,I could not finish this. It was a bash session on another persons presentation. It was frustrating and had a vengeful feeling. While I have seen Super Size Me and I can't say that I loved it but I also did not love this clear attack on that movie. I would skip this unless you need to watch something that is angry and vengeful. Then you should watch this.
2,This is a comedian?,"I could not get through half of this. Maybe got a quarter or a third of the way through. Can't listen to that much whining sarcasm at once. Although anyone can lie in a documentary, including Spurlock (whom he demonizes), this guy purposefully ignores the points made in Supersize Me, which were not all about math, etc. For example, when I quit, this guy was talking about how patronizing Spurlock was about the poor. I don't remember if he was or not. But the point to me is that poor people are sometimes fat in part because McDonald's and grocery food that is cheap is also often high calorie food. Good grocery or restaurant food is not an option. Whether or not I get this guy's points, I couldn't hack it any more and bailed."
1,"Snarky, biased, and obnoxious movie","It really seems like this guy has a personal vendetta against Morgan Spurlock. Or maybe he's just bankrolled by McDonalds?Either way, the tone of this movie was snarky, snippy, childish, and petty. I had no pre-judgements before watching ""Fat Head"", but was almost instantly turned off by Mr. Naughton's overly simplistic and obnoxious retorts to Spurlock's claims from the movie ""Supersize Me"".Truth be told, I couldn't even make it through the whole film. Naughton's whiny tone forced me to shut it off and walk away about 3/4 of the way through --- I simply had enough."
5,A Must See Movie -- Timeless Classic,"This was an excellent movie/documentary/comedy about how the American Public has been taken down the wrong path in the search of a healthy diet.While I realize that Tom Naughton is a stand-up comic, and not a Dr or Dietician, I understand the science that he is trying to prove, and it makes perfect sense.Everyone who is struggling with losing weight, controlling their cholesterol or Blood Glucose needs to watch this video.I especially enjoy how this movie goes after some of the fundamental flaws in the SUPERSIZE ME movie.You will be entertained and educated while watching this movie. WATCH IT TODAY!!!!!"
1,Misleading,"In trying to make a point about personal freedom and responsibility, Naughton not only seems to miss the point entirely, but he's misleading in doing so. His critique of Super Size Me being sensationalist is fair, but that's the only truth I could discern from this (completely un-funny) movie."
1,BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME!,This guy needs to stick with his geeky computer life and eat McDonalds the rest of his life. Then we'll see if he still thinks eating controlled fast food calories is ok. Do not watch
4,IT'S NEVER TOO LATE!,"Like the Move, the Small Faces were much more popular in England than in the USA. Unlike the Move, I never listened to many of the Small Faces' recordings. I purchased this CD more out of curiosity than anything else. But what a revelation!I knew Steve Marriot was a great singer, Kenny Jones joined the Who, Ian McLagan went on to play with many notable musicians, and Ronnie Lane was a fine songwriter but I didn't know how wonderful they were when they were together. Some truly great songwriting and performances from these gentlemen - powerful pop, soulful instrumentals in the Booker T vein, psychedelia,and so much more.While much of their output remains timeless some of these tracks sound dated,hence the four-star rating. However, more of the material rates five stars. I recommend this collection without reservation to anyone smitten by the 'British Invasion' of the 60's...or if you simply enjoy well-crafted tunes."
4,replacement for OEM,"I purchased this to replace the factory idler arm which went out at 80k (!!). It was very easy to locate this and similar parts on Amazon's parts finder for my selected vehicle. This moog part K8283 seemed heavier duty than stock + had the necessary grease fittings to help this part last longer (IMO) than the OEM which was a non-serviceable type. MAKE sure you pay attention to which way the old mounting bracket is attached to your car frame and I needed a tie rod ""pickle fork"" tool to separate the old arm from the steering stabilizer bolt. A small fine blade wood chisel will prove helpful to drive the old sleeve UP AND OFF the stabilizer's bolt. It took 2 hrs to complete job."
3,Excellent abbreviated guide for high school students but very overpriced,"For the last two years I have had my Pre-AP freshman purchase this book for their research papers. It is much more concise that the full MLA Guide, contains the essentials, & its reduced contents makes it more student user-friendly.However, it is very overpriced -- $16+ for a 48 page book? Come on. In fact, it is so overpriced that I believe I will begin looking for another choice this summer. Many students have difficulty purchasing school supplies, & I'm starting to feel guilty about having this one on my purchase list."
1,A Guide To Mla Documentation,"I was expecting a book, but I received a pamphlet instead. There was nothing special about the content. So, because of the price and lack of content I returned the order. It wasn't worth the price."
1,1950's style history,"If you prefer your history written in the style of the 1950's, then this book is for you. The ""Indians"" are variably described as 'hostiles' and ""banging on their war drums while they screamed their defiance"", their battles described as ""massacres"" the US army response as ""vengeance"", ""the punishing hand of Andrew Jackson"".One has the impression that the British and the Spanish are dastardly characters who deserved to lose the battle of New Orleans. There is some reasonably nice history of the city and the battle, but I must confess I hadn't the stomach to finish this book.What I read of the book is too black and white, heroes and villains, good guys and bad guys for my taste. I would have returned it if I hadn't accidentally torn the dust cover just after receiving it."
4,The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,I read this book years ago...It is funny but also hasa serious side to it. I love the humor but also thelesson in seeing the Christmas story with the eyes ofchildren who have been denied the right to go to church.I bought it this time as a gift for an inmate at our County Jail.It gave him a big smile.Kathy in Las Vegas
1,Not what I expected,"I thought it was an illustrated version of the full story. I was disappointed and will now have to order the novel. A waste of money, in my opinion.."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is an awesome story and the narration was incredible. The raspy voice of the narrator made all of the characters come alive. She did a great job changing her tones and voices to make the characters fun. We listened in the car on a long trip to San Diego over the holidays to visit family and it was the fastest 1.5 hours of the trip for us! It has a wonderful story about children and the true Christmas story. My family would recommend this to anyone, great entertainment, great story!"
3,Not Same Impact as the Longer Book,"This version is fine, but not a substitute for the longer version. The actual book is much funnier. But this is just fine for a short, read-aloud bedtime book for younger kids."
1,You are kidding me?,"I paid $28.78 for a new, hardcover (library binding) book. This is a cheap paper back! It says $3.50 on the corner. I am returning it."
3,The Best Christmas Pagent Ever,"The Best Christmas Pagent Ever was an ok book. It wasn't the best book I have ever read but it was sort of funny. I would reccomend this book for anyone who likes funny books, or some one who likes books that have people who get in trouble."
3,Great book but poorly packed.,"The book itself is great....a classic christmas story that my nephews will read for years to come. However, the book jacket came ripped, probably because it was shipped in a box that was much too large and no packing filler was used, leaving the book to be bounced around inside the box. Very disappointing as the book was meant as a gift."
3,A good book to read.,The Women that runs the Christmas Pageant Broke her leg so she hires a women to do it all the maen herdmans get the big parts in the Pageant and all the rehearsals go rong Butwhen the real play comes it shows the true meaning of Christmas. The seting was ain the gim.
3,The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,The setting of the story takes place in the church where they pracite for the pageant.The main event is that they are doing a Christmas pageant.They ask people that go to there church if they would like to be in the pageant.THhe Herdman famiy wanted to be in the pagent.
5,The best Christmas novella ever!,"Even at the ripe old age of 18, sometimes I just have to pull this book off the shelf and spend an afternoon with it, regardless of the season. The characters and the situation are just so real, and many passages about past pageants do call up memories of my own childhood in the church. The narrator's youthfully practical point of view is natural and unforced, and her observations are subtly insightful. But in the end, it's the Herdmans and their revelations that really make this book a classic, and it's in characterizing them that the author really shines. There's really not much that needs to be said about this book when you get right down to it. It's pure, thoughtful entertainment."
5,This book was a exciting &&&&& heart-breaking book.,The Herman kids were the worst bunch of kids you ever laid eyes on.They did everything they knew was wrong or cruel.Most ofthe town was terrified of them.Iliked this book cause just cause you are bad does not mean you can't change.
4,funny and thought=provoking at the same time,"Whether you have kids or not, this book is a must-read. Not only is it hilarious, it will give you fresh insight into the traditional Christmas story."
5,Great story,"If this book does not make you laugh, check your pulse.Lots of fun. Great for the whole family."
4,A Christmas classic for all ages,"Timeless book that can be read again and again. My kids never tire of hearing the Herdman's call the wisemen ""dirty spies,"" or Gladys Herdman crying out, ""Hey! Unto you a child is born!"" Amidst the name calling and the cigar smoking lies an important reminder, to kids and adults alike, as we celebrate Christmas: Jesus came not to call the righteous, but sinners.""He said,'It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire compassion, and not sacrifice,' for I did not come to call the righteous but sinners.'"" (Matthew 9:12-13)"
5,Very good read,I had seen the movie years ago and loved it. My 7 year old has to read every night for school so I got it to read for December. We all loved it.
3,Interesting,A different kind of Christmas story from what we've been used to but a nice message for everyone at the end of this querky book!
1,FUNNY,So funny!LOLI love this book I read it 3 times because it is so good. The Herdmans turned out to be good.
5,Hilarious,"I am a 10 year old reader from Japan. This book was hilarious, specificly the part about the califlower in his ear and the almost made me cry."
5,The Horrendous Herdmans!,"In school, this was a favorite around holiday time because it was sure to please and often used as a read-aloud treat. Each day as I read it to the class, I would laugh hysterically, but on the last day, no matter how hard I tried, I could not read it without choking up. I'm sure the kids thought I was nuts!"
2,It was an okay book,It was a good bookI would recommend this book to a teacher or a friendBarbara Robinson you did a great job on this book!!!!!! Lol
5,C's Book Review,"The Best Christmas Pageant EverBarbara RobinsonThis book was great. I am glad I got it for Christmas. From blowing up buildings to plants growing out of ears, this book is funny. The Herdmans are like mini twisters and live in an abandoned parking lot garage. They have a deadly one eyed bobcat. I strongly recommend this to kids who like other hectic kids. I thought it was perfect. This book would probaly be realistic fiction."
4,Cute story. Fast reading.,"Nice story to read around Christmas time, about a disruptive neighborhood family the traditional Christmas pageant. Cute story, fast reading."
3,Wrong book,"I had expected the book version, not the children's PICTURE book version. Not explained well in the desription. The kids saw it so I kept it and ordered the BOOK version this time."
5,The Best Christmas Pagent Ever,A laugh out loud story about staging a Christmas Pagent. Absolutely delightful! You'll enjoy every page. Buy the movie too.ASIN:0064402754 The Best Christmas Pageant Ever]]
3,What's a Pageant?,"I, personally, loved the book! Great story line and beautiful illustrations, but my 3 grandchildren (ages 6, 7, & 9) didn't get it!! They don't have the Christmas story at our schools anymore, and even though they go to church, it is usually a late night service with baby Jesus.Sadly, my children don't read the Christmas story to their children as Christmas approaches. Now ""The Night Before Christmas"" is read over and over while looking forward to Santa coming, but, Jesus is left in the manger. This year the retail stores had Christmas decorations out before Thanksgiving!! So what's Christmas really about?"
5,I've loved this little gem for so long,"I'll be brief, since everyone's covered the subject matter ... what makes this little book so remarkable is how it makes you feel. Our family has been reading it for years now and it wouldn't be Christmas without it. Everyone has their favorite character and we quote lines from the book throughout the year. I favor Imogene.As another reviewer has said, order extra copies to give away. Spread the word."
4,That's what I'm talking about.........,"This is a solid 4-song ep from a group that has a big future ahead of them. I got this on a recommendation from a friend and am very glad I did. The packaging and the sound quality are world-class. But the songwriting is what really stands out. Check it out, you won't regret it...."
5,One of my favorite pre-adolescent reads!,"I've been an avid reader since childhood, and this book was one of my favorites during my pre-adolescent years (late 70s). I've always thought of it as kind of an obscure book, so I was shocked when I stumbled across it on a list of favorite children's books. The kudos are well-deserved, though: as others have said, this is a wonderful, unique mystery story. As you read the book, various clues are provided to help you solve the mystery of Leon's (I mean Noel!) disappearance; two twins, a boy and a girl, work to solve the mystery along with you. I re-read the book many times, and it was just as enjoyable even after I knew the answer to the mystery (which I had NOT been able to figure out on my own!). A great, timeless read for girls and boys alike."
4,The Mysterious Appearance of this Book,"I have been searching for this book for approximately 10 years. I remembered reading this book in elementary school, but could not remember the full title nor the author. I stumbled across it while looking up The Westing Game, also by the same author. The Mysterious Disappearance of Leon... will be entertaining while allowing children to use deductive reasoning skills to find the wearabouts of the title character."
4,"This is a silly, confusing, and mysterious mystery book","I really liked the book that I read called The MysteriousDisappearance Of Leon (I Mean Noel) by Ellen Raskin.It was a silly, ridiculous, funny, confusing, mysterious mystery.This book is very funny, although the part near the end may bekind of possibly a little bit shocking, it's only temporary, trust me.In the end everything (well, not everything, just almost all the thingsinvolving almost all of the characters in this book) is alright, andall of the major characters (with the exeption of Leon, I mean, Noel of course)are fine. If you like silly mysteries, you may want to read this book."
3,Easy to Use but uncomfortable after 1/2 hour,"Product is very easy to use, but after 30 minutes of wearing it it becomes painful..I can hear the other people fine but they tell me that they hear wind/static on their end even when I drive with windows rolled up."
3,Good headset but uncomfortable,"This headset is decent for the price. The microphone works well but the problem lies in the comfort. Its alittle tricky to put the headset on quick, and after about 45 minutes it becomes painful. I would recommend the Sony Ericcson HBH-IV835 all day over this. Its alittle more but worth it."
2,"decent function, lousy construction","this is my second logitech set. my 1st was a mobile freedom which its ear loop broke after 6 months. logitech replaced it with this one 12/06. now 2 weeks prior to one year the ear loop snapped off of this one. POOR design which outweighs the otherwise very reasonable functionality of the device.called logitech and they are refunding my money, which is ok as i do not want another one!"
2,Excrutiating,"This headset works well - I don't hear any static nor do those to whom I am speaking. I use this primarily with my laptop and Skype. The range is a tad better than my BlueAnt X3.However, this earpiece is extremely painful! Beware! I have tried various positions and it really, really hurts."
2,"Functionally OK, breaks too easy",I've had two of these Logitech headsets and both broke. Functionally they worked fine and were nice and small. But due to their limited lifespan I've switched to Motorola.
2,No compatible with Logitech bluetooth hub??,"i think that logitech make the best accessories. I have the camera, the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer. The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public.It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub. Don't you find that strange? Aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model). In addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you."
4,Can you hear me now?,"I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product, but that's not to say that that the product is not without some flaws. The reception, clarity, and battery life is quite good. Also, my hearing isn't the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don't have to strain to hear. My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit. I've gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on, but it's still very annoying at times. Even with this slight annoyance, I would definitely buy this product again"
1,"Most uncomfortable headset ever, bad reception","Avoid this product at all costs!! I used this headset for only 2 days before giving it the heave-ho. When you first put it on, it does not feel all that uncomfortable...however, after 30 to 45 minutes of use, your ear feels like it is in a vice! Plus, the reception is fine when sitting in a car, however if you stand up it gets crackly and is extremely hard to hear. I repeat: Avoid this product at all costs!!"
2,Dissapointment,"I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant."
3,"Good sound, okay transmission, fair battery, poor comfort","The title sums it up. The sound in th earpiece is pretty good, better than the phone in my case. However, if you have the volume turned all the way up, the other party receives a fair amount of feedback. This can be troublesome during calls with poor connections. The tramission to the phone allows you about 25-30 feet, which is not too shabby. The battery life, however, leaves something to be desired. I generally get about 3 hours talk time total, and find I have to put the unit on the charger more often than I care to. Lastly, the earpiece becomes quite uncomfortable, even when shifting it around. I can only stand it for about an hour and then my ear hurts; it hurts even worse when you take it off as your ear tries to take back its normal shape.It bears mentioning that I received this unit as a replacement/upgrade to the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset, which was defective right from the package.My next headset will probably be a Jabra."
2,Very uncomfortable,"The sound quality and functionality of the headset are fine, comparable with others. However, the comfort is just terrible. Not only is it tricky to put on, but after an hour or so of wear, it is very painful.Since I use a headset for hours a day, this one was no good for me."
2,"Good sound good life, too bad it's a cheap piece of rabbit dung","I've had two of these. Both sounded and worked well for a few months. then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second. When this happens, you're perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery. While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of ""memory titanum"" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet) Skip by this one if you're smart. I've been had twice."
2,Uncomfortable,"I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller.Unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts.Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine.But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that? Then when the phone rings, I don't hear it.Then the clip broke on this one as well. Logitech again replaced it. But how long will this one lsat?Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
4,Works good in noisy areas.,"I've used this model headset for 6 months, and the sound quality is great. I drive a truck for a living, and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck. The ""windstop"" technology works good. I wear it about 6-7 hours a day. The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort. Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at ""rest"". It beeps when it disconnects, and reconnects automatically, usually within a minute or two. Would (and have) recommended to friends."
2,Beware ... NOT the original versions of the songs,"The album has a fine track listing. Just be warned that these aren't the original versions of Bill Haley & The Comets' hit songs. Those were recorded in the mid fifties with Decca, but when Haley switched labels (to Warner, I think?) in 1960, he promptly re-recorded all his old hits for the new label. (Roy Orbison and many others of this era did the same thing.) So what you're getting here is the 1960 re-recordings, NOT the originals. If you're just looking for some fun music (or are a Haley completist), this disc will provide it; but if you're looking for the original versions, this CD is a ripoff."
2,Cry for a Shadow,"Buy this CD only if you are a very serious Beatles fan and have everything else. The tracks on this CD are mainly sound bytes of people recalling the Beatles' early days in Hamburg -- mostly acquaintances. The music on this CD is mostly the Beatles backing up Tony Sheridan. There is only one track which shows the instrumental ability of the Beatles -- ""Cry for a Shadow.""There is no singing by Paul, John, George, or Ringo. In fact, I think that Pete Best is the drummer here. This is not an authorized product by the Beatles, etc, etc., etc. I bought it for $3 in a clearance bin -- only for the instrumental. I don't think I would pay more. Unless you are desperate to collect every single piece of Beatles memorabilia available, give this one a bye."
5,Wow - one of the best trackball device ever,"I used to use keyboard with trackball and then over the years moved to mouse. However I bought Slimball and decided to try track ball again. I was extremely disappointed by Slimball. Then started looking up reviews and expert track ball was recommended. I exchanged slimball with expert track ball. Boy the difference between the two products is that of night and day. Expert trackball is amazing, it is so well engineered that using it is a breeze, buttons are just 'there' . Scroll ring is fantastic.I would highly recommend this product to anyone.Regards,Purvesh"
3,"Great Trackball, if it worked on windows 7.","I've used this model and the one before it for years. I love it, which is why I am so disappointed I can't use the features on Windows 7. They have a driver, but it won't work for me. I contacted support and they said that sometimes it works and sometimes not. If it does not, then you don't get to use the features, but it's still a good mouse. I would rate it 5 stars if it worked. I still use the mouse, but all I have is right & left click and scroll."
2,Misleading,"This ball mouse does NOT work on a Mac! The ball works, but the programmable buttons do not. It gives a nice ""break"" from the normal mouse, but don't expect to be able to program the extra buttons. Save your money."
2,Kensington Expert Mouse,Kensington products do not seem to be as good as they were a few years ago. I have been using a Turbo ball from them for at least 15 years and this one does not live up to my expectations.
5,First trackball,"I am a recent convert to the trackball. I've always teased my friends who used one until I had to use one at work. Going home and using a standard mouse just didn't feel right anymore so I am glad to pick this up. While I do feel it is a bit pricey, the precision and available button options is great."
1,Useless in Windows Vista,"Having used this trackball and its predecessors for more than 10 years, I couldn't believe that Kensington no longer supports it with software for Vista. Believe it! Tech Support quote (05 June 2007):""There will be no Kensington MouseWork software support on windows Vista and there is no way to program the extra buttons of the mouse or trackball in Windows Vista."" This invalidates just about all the features of the trackball, and you get no more functionality than you do with a mouse. Beware of the advertising for this product."
3,Turboball is better,"I've used the Expert Trackball for a few years. It has a lot of great features, but the Kensington Turboball (which I've used at home for 6 years) gives you the same things (except for the cool scroll circle) in a **MUCH** better ergonomic design. Kensington needs to come out with an OPTICAL version of the Turboball, as it is the BEST trackball design I've ever used. The only real problem with the Turboball is that it is non-optical and thus hard to keep clean. KENSINGTON: Optical Turboball, please!"
2,Disappointing - Poor design,"As mentioned previously, great trackball, poor design.I took a chance anyway and I now still have to try and find a proper trackball mouse since this one has a dreadful fault making it unusable.The design makes your wrist bend backward too much as the ball is too high, guaranteeing RSI in no time. The supplied wristrest is useless (too short for big hands) and feels cheap (not silicone).A shame as the trackball itself has a nice size and feel to it.The ball should be inclined forward, not backward. If that means a smallerball, then so be it. Users serious about their trackballs should look elsewhere.Note to Kensington : the wrist should never bend and the hand should always be in the alignment of the forearm ! Hint : look at the first Microsoft trackball design...What a waste."
2,Feels cheaper than my $40 thumb trackball,"I am a web developer and I use a mouse actively ALL day long. After reading the reviews I was disappointed when I actually got my hands on this mouse. Feels cheaper than my $40 thumb trackball and puts much more strain on my wrist. It has a very sloppy/sticky action compared to my Logitech thumb trackball. It is over priced, over complicated, not very precise, nor very ergonomic."
3,Don't buy if you are left handed and use Vista.,"I've had one for three years - loved it. I recently ""upgraded"" to Vista and found that Kensington doesn't have a driver for this trackball that works in Vista. The good news is that the trackball still works, that bad news is that you can't reprogram the buttons. If you're left handed, this makes the trackball virtually unusable. Kensington should have released a Vista driver."
4,Kensington Trackball,Very happy with the optical trackball. The past trackball mouse that I have all developed problems with the rubber rollers making them stall and skip. This one is so smooth and responsive there's no comparison. The upper buttons are a bit tough to reach at times and take a while to get used to.
5,Kensington Does It Again,"A superbly designed trackball. Especially the ring (acts as a wheel). Works great, no software needed, just plug it into an available USB port and start mousing."
1,terrible for scrolling,Pros: It feels nice to use your fingers on the roller if you have finger pains from clicking so much like I do.Cons: The scrolling ring is terrible. The motion is rough. You have to first turn it some for the computer to see it then it reponds normal. Not good for small motions. I think they allowed their electrical enginners to do what they needed a mechanical engineer for.
2,NOT AS GOOD ANYMORE,"Kensington Expert Mouse used to be A-1. Not any longer. It has four buttons, a ball and a scroll wheel. Only 2 buttons are programmable so 2 are just duplicates or non-functionable. It has excellent pointer speed, but nothing between very fast and almost stop. Most important is that it is so sensitive, the slightest touch can lose what you're doing or working on. THIS IS VERY BAD! It seems there is no calibration made on this mouse--just slap four buttons around a ball and sell it to long time users. If I hadn't thrown out my older one, I'd return this one.I need a good mouse because of manual problems--this is not it, even though Kensington advertises it's ergonomic qualities. Because of these deficiencies price is too high. Would NOT recommend it."
4,Warning! Does NOT work w/ Vista 64,"I have used Kensington trackballs for 22 years. If you have a Mac, or never intend to go past Windows XP, it's almost a perfect device.BUT! Apparently Windows Vista does not support ANYTHING with more than two buttons and a scroll, including their own 5-button mice. I am mutiply disabled--and am lost without it. Kensington says they will not write software to be compatible w/ Vista. I am dismayed and disappointed."
4,"Good, but still hoping for better","It fits my hand well and all of the movements are smooth. The scroll wheel on mine does not have the problems others have described nor do I have a problem placing the cursor. The acceleration panel in Mouseworks allows fine control. I believe the large size of the ball is also helpful in this regard. However, though this is the best I have found, I believe that the four button design could be improved upon by replacing the upper two with 5 to 7 smaller programmable function keys and possibly one along each side."
4,cheap feelin' but good,"The Kensington Trackball is nice, but I'm a little dismayed at its cost. The scroll-wheel is very sticky and chunky for it being close to $100. Otherwise a great replacement for the standard cramp-inducing mouse!The scroll-wheel on the demo unit at the store was smooth, so maybe it just needs a few million turns for the plastic to wear..."
1,Not Vista Compatible,"The ExpertMouse has been a great product for many years. Unfortunately, contrary to the Kensington website and even the information on the ExpertMouse package, it does not work properly with Windows Vista systems. Kensington MouseWorks software does not work properly with Windows Vista, and according to Kensington Tech Support, they will not be making it work with Vista. This means that all those extra buttons will not work. Kensington has refused to resolve this issue. If you have a Vista computer, this trackball is a rip off."
4,The king of trackballs,"If you like track-balls, this is the way to go!I have owned two of these--the first (bought many years ago) didn't work after a few weeks of use and I felt totally ripped off, but this one works fine. I decided to try it again because of the ergonomic benefits--I am happy that I did!"
5,Better than I expected!,"I was in need of a trackball mouse because of lower arm pain due to a death grip I was using on the regular mouse. Since using the new Kensington, I have noticed a significant decrease in the pain. The trackball is super easy to operate. It may take a little getting used to, but not enough to have that be the reason for not getting one. The ball moves very smoothly and the ring for scrolling up and down may be a little stiff at first, but that definitely goes away with use. The Kensington proved to be better than I expected! So glad I got one!"
4,"Great, but scrolling broke after a year","Excellent trackball, easier to clean than the Orbit and feels better on my wrist. Only complaint was that the scrolling mechanism broke after a year - that's the black circle surrounding the ball in the center, which is supposed to scroll pages when you turn it. Big fan of Kensington though, having tried so many with my Macs. Still going to continue purchasing Kensington trackballs because others don't work as well on a Mac."
5,Best one yet.,"Everything I wanted, especially in game playing since the ball is right on top and not on the side. Great item for the price."
5,great mouse right out of the box,"this is a great mouse right out of the box. we opened it, plugged it into the USB port on our mac, and it worked like a dream. Smooth rolling and very easy to control."
5,Simply the BEST mouse made!!!,"I would never own any other Trackball/Mouse! I am thinking about buying a few of these in case they should quit making them available. This is my second the first one is still in use, I just moved it to my office. Bought the first one about 5 years ago."
4,An Easy Touch,"I needed a trackball to work in a limited horizontal space, and was surprised at how few are still on the market, especially if you don't want to control the ball with your thumb. No model had flawless reviews. I finally chose this one and have been delighted. The ball itself is smooth, light in action, quick, and precise. The buttons are fine, the ring is ok (I can't really compare it to anything else), and it works immediately and flawlessly with Vista. The only negative is that Kensington has not invested in updating its software so that the top two buttons can be configured in Vista. So two feature buttons go to waste. For my purposes, however, this trackball is well-made, a joy to use, saves my wrist, and looks good in a solid sort of way."
5,Great for Carpel Tunnel sufferers.,"Amazing product, easy to use, very comfortable, responsive for games and precise for high resolution work. Use them at both home and work. Does need to be cleaned each month, but so easy to do. When was the last time you cleaned your mouse? Removes so much pressure from the wrist too."
1,"Nice hardware, horrific product support","I have a a kensington expert mouse pro for about 5 years now, and while the product is of great quality, hardware wise, I'm extremely displeased with kensingtons lack of support or interest for their customers who use a 64 bit systems. Everytime I do a system upgrade I have major hassles getting this device to work properly (if you are ok with two buttons, no problem, but then you wouldnt buy a four button device), no word from customer support whatsoever, and absolutely zero support if you happen to be using Linux. Handle with care, if possible choose an alternative with better support."
1,"Not worth the money, better spend your money on good mouse!!!","Low Quality control, scroll wheel is not good, scroll wheel is not smooth, it's rough almost all around. My intention was to use this trackball with drafting program like Sketchup and ACAD but turned out that I am missing a middle button, so I had to program one of the 4 button for that function but it does work well like the middle button on the scroll wheel of a mouse.I would not recommend this trackball."
2,You're not paying for durability.,"I want to and should be able to love this trackball: right size, right feel (though the scroll ring feels coarse and cheap), right usability, excellent tactility, great software.But the deal-breaker on this trackball is its utterly lacking durability. I am on my 4th replacement from Kensington in a year now. In all cases, clockwise scroll ring rotation and primary button clicks became erratic. Kensington dutifully sent a replacement unit every time while under warranty, but now that warranty period is over and I again have a barely-usable device. Note that I'm not a gamer, nor have I subjected this device to any other ""hard"" usage.Kensington charges too much for something that is clearly not meant to last. I am now looking to Logitech and lesser-known ""ergonomic specialist"" brands for my trackball needs."
5,Love this Trackball!,I've used a Kensington trackball for the past 15 years at my places of work and at home. I was leery about ordering the new one after reading some of the reviews but I needn't have worried.I installed it at work and was immediately productive once I got used to needing a lighter touch when using it. I still have an Expert Trackball 5.0 at home and see (and feel) the big difference between each of them in how they are handled. The new one wins hands down!
4,Great trackball,"I switched to trackball mice after I quit gaming, and have been unable to go back. That said, I missed having a scroll wheel, as this is ubiquitous among modern mice. This trackball cures that problem. The large ball used in this trackball is great, allows you to throw the pointer across multi-monitor displays with ease. There are only two flaws: it has a pretty steep slant built into the housing, so reaching the bottom two (which happen to be the right and left click) buttons takes some adjustment, and the scroll wheel isn't smooth. it's easy enough to grab the wheel with multiple fingers, however, and this seems to deliver more consistent scrolling. While these two flaws are a slight nuisance, this is still the best trackball I have used."
5,Best Trackball Bar None,"Simple and elegant - this is the best trackball out there, and I've tried many. I have bought many Kensington track balls over the years, and I have 4 of this model or my various machines. It is easily the best combination of ergonomics, solid performance, quality of build, and usability.And their customer support is second to none.Do your wrist a favor and use this instead of a mouse!"
1,DO NOT BUY FOR VISTA/7,This turboball does not provide functionality with Vista or Windows 7. The worst aspect is the disgusting customer support from Kensington. The company has no intention of providing software for the current Windows OS. They simply state that it can be used as a simple turboball with no additional functionality. The packaging for this product clearly states that the turboball requires ... Windows XP OR LATER!!!!!!!. Talk about misleading advertising! I would suggest that purchasers refuse to buy any kensington products.
3,Track Ball from Kensington,"The wired track ball from Kensington is easy to use and comfortable. I am however disappointed that they discontinued the wireless model, it had more features and the obvious, ""IT WAS WIRLESS!"
4,Nice Scrolling,"The big trackball is really nice. It takes some time to get used to it but once you get the hang of it, it's better than using the mouse.And unlike the normal mouse, you don't have to move it around so you take up less space.The wheel shaped scroll is also very nice. It's really clever how they put it around the ball so that you don't have to change the position of your hand to scroll.The small drawback is the wheel shaped scroll is a little bit flappy and unstable. I wish they made it more tighter.Also the software which come with it does not support Vista so you can't use the utilities but I don't have much problems without it."
1,I expected A LOT MORE from this one!,"I'm a mice dispositives fan. I've always been, and in my lap top I always have a mouse/trackball connected as well as my Wntuos3 Wacom tablet.Right now I'm using the Wow Pen Eco as a mouse instead of my ""ex-a lot much desired"" Kensington Expert Mouse because the simple reason that it doesn't respond when I move the trackball!! It is not possible that when ever I try to move my cursor or pointer, I have to wait moving the ball until it finally decides to reaction!I am SO desapointed with this. The sistem would be very comfortable if only it worked as normal as any other mouse.I couldn't send it back because I broke the box when it was packed, otherwise I would be rid of it immediately!This is my experience with this device!"
1,Tonka Toy Junk,"I bought this mouse after reading rave reviews. I have had surgery for Carpal Tunnel syndrome on both of my hands and was looking for a trackball that was smooth and prevent hand and wrist fatigue. I was willing to spend some money and excited at the prospect of this mouse. When I received it, right out of the box it felt light and cheap. Once I hooked it up the wireless aspect worked fine but the ball was not smooth at all. My hand was really fatigued after 5 minutes. I immediately boxed it up and sent it back. Note, if you are returning an item to Amazon because you don't like it, they are going to charge you for the shipping. Anyway, I am glad to be rid of that junk. The Kensington Trackball Model #64327 is by far the smoothest trackball I have ever used. My only complaint is its lack of a scroll wheel button."
2,Dangerous device,"Earlier reviews rated this highly for ergonomics but I found that as it's higher in front than the back you have to bend your wrist up in a very strained position. I had to make an angled tray to compensate but, as the ball is not secured, there's a risk of it falling out when properly angled to avoid wrist strain.It's software is disappointing & doesn't seem well integrated with Windows XP - unlike Logitech's Mouseware, the device only shows as a generic HID in Control Panel Mouse. Its pluses: the scroll wheel is very comfortable & having 4 buttons is good. Overall, not recommended - avoid if you have wrist problems."
3,Comfortable but high on maintenance,I give my mouse low scores in quality and cleaning ease simply because it frequently stops working and resolves with a cleaning. I've used many a mouse and trackball for decades. Never have I had one so needy of cleanings. I use a high performance mac and find the Kensington MouseWorks software lacking as it seems to suffer from latency. Maybe Kensington should hire some software engineers to update their drivers.
5,Still a great mouse/trackball!,This is my third Expert Mouse. I LOVE it!The one at my office is about 9 years old and still working well.I bought this one to replace the one for home I lost while moving.
5,Kensington Trackball,"This is a great trackball for newer computers. I have two older versions of it that I still use with my older computers. This is perfect for people with finger, wrist, or other repetitive stress problems. It's ideal if you have very little room to move a mouse around, because the base just sits there while you move the ball with your fingers. I've tried a number of other types of trackball, and this is the only one I liked."
5,LOVE'EM,"use it all the time and has kept my files safe,as said in the add ,and very fast delevery,thankz would order again,use all time"
2,"Good design, needs Vista drivers","I was terribly disappointed when I tried to install this trackball on my Vista laptop. There is no driver for Vista, which meant that I could not program the buttons at all, and 2 of the four had absolutely no purpose. So, I returned it. On the good side, the design is quite comfortable (I am a woman with smallish hands but long fingers), and I love the placement of the scroll ring. If Kensington writes a Vista driver, I'll get another one, but until then, my hunt continues."
4,works well,"I like this product. It has a big track ball and six programmable options from four buttons. I knocked off one star because the scroll wheel is easy to use once you get used to it, but makes this grinding noise (which is normal as I have tried two of them). The wheel could operate better if designed better, so I don't think they should call that feature ""award winning""."
5,Expert Mice are Wonderful,"I have both the Expert & the expert pro and have found them to be fabulous! I bought the Expert because of a project that benefited from having the programmable buttons so I could run the entire show from the mouse!The Pro was my step up because I'm a gadget freak, but I've returned to just the expert based solely on the ring scrolling. the Pro may have all the additional buttons, but it has the typical scroll wheel and I've grown to love the ring on the Expert that that was a deal breaker. the Pro now, as big as it is, has become my travel mouse.The best of both worlds would be if the Pro had a ring scroll wheel and was white to go with my mac! Kensington please be listening..."
4,Expert Trackball,I love this trackball. The large ball makes movement smooth and effortless. Once you program the four buttons and the movement rates (very easy to do) you will never go back to a regular mouse. The one drawback to this trackball is the slow response with the scroll ring. You have to move it several times to go from top to bottom of a page. It is rather jerky compared to Apple's Mighty Mouse. It will scroll only vertically. If Kensington can come out with a single button horizontal/vertical scroll on this trackball they will have the perfect mouse.
2,Disappointing,"Too much drag on the roller. The scroll ring movement feels like a partially failed ratchet. Button action is acceptable. The older model with mechanical rollers was much better. Less expensive, too."
1,Do Not Buy - No Support,"I've had the Expert Mouse for a couple years. It works great on Windows XP, and the hardware is reliable and easy to maintain (especially cleaning is very easy.) However, the drivers for this trackball are not supported under Windows Vista, and Kensington's support department will tell you that they never will be - if they ever respond to your support request. And, both the Expert Mouse and Vista are current products! This means that on Vista, you can't use the two top buttons, or any of the chording (double-presses) that Kensington advertises, and that I bought the Expert Mouse for. The arrogance of Kensington is unbelievable. You really can't count on them to be there for you when you need them. It's like they're *trying* to go out of business. Avoid this product."
1,Will not work reliably under Vista,Just be aware that Kensington will not be developing or supporting the software supplied with this unit unit vista - Their web site has this confirmed!
2,not fully supported in Vista,"Thank you for contacting Kensington Technical Support.We regret to inform you that, our Kensington mice are compatible with vista as a normal mouse but it will not give the capability of programming the buttons.There will be no Kensington Mouse Work's software support on windows Vista and there is no way to program the extra buttons of the mouse or trackball in Windows Vista.We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused to you.If you need further assistance, please feel free to reply to this message or call to our technical support toll-free number (1-800-535-4242) from Monday through Friday anytime, between 7:30am and 4:30pm Pacific Time, and we will happily assist you with your problem.Regards,Rinki KumariKensington Technical Support"
1,Poor Ring Tracking,"I have been using Kensington Trackballs all my life. But I was very disappointed with the tracking ring on this one. While all the other features are terrific (regular mouse tracking is great), this is no longer good enough when comparing to other devices like Apple's Wireless Mighty Mouse.I also found that the elevation of the Expert Trackball was higher and at a different angle than previous trackballs, making my wrist tired very quickly.Overall, I don't recommend this. The one I purchased I have already given away."
1,I'm sincerely disappointed . . .,"I purchased the Kensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball about 4 years ago to use on my Mac workstation. It is wonderful. I liked it so much, I recently purchased a second one to use at work on my PC.What a disappointment. The new one LOOKS like the first one I purchased, but it sure doesn't work like that one.The trackball is ""stiff"" - it doesn't feel like velvet under my fingertips like to older one. Maybe it just needs to be ""broken in"". But the scroll ring, mentioned in other reviews, is simply unacceptable. The new one feels like it has sand in it. It moves very roughly. My older model absolutely glides - like on ball bearings.If this is typical of the quality of this product, it has certainly been compromised since I purchased the original one. I don't think I can live with this. I'll probably pack it up and return it.Acco - are you listening?"
4,a valuable addition,"i am a graphic designer and depending on the mouse i either have pain in my wrist or my pointer finger. So my fix is an array of options, the wowpen, the evoluent, the wacam tablet, and now the kensington trackball. I generally use one for a week then switch off, and the kensington has been a valuable addition to the suite, especially because i can even switch off and use it with my left hand. It works perfectly with my mac, and it's easy to use and well built. I'm just waiting until we can use ESP."
4,USB Trackball Mouse,"I have been using this mouse for about a month now and I am very happy with its performance. The programability of the buttons coupled with the scrolling feature make this trackball one of the best I have tried.I do have to agree with a previous review, the wrist pad does not adequately support the hand in a position that would make using this mouse more smooth, however, after using it for a week, it seems to be un-noticable as I get used to using it.Overall I am very happy with this purchase, but I hope the manufacturer, changes the angle of this mouse in the future to be downward sloping away from the wrist instead of an upward slope. If that happens, I will be first in line to get the new version."
3,Kensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball,"First, if you are using Windows Vista this mouse is next to useless, unless you have a major disability that prevents you from using a different mouse. I have used this mouse since 95 and boy has it been wonderful. Drop and dray, copy and paste, right and left click, scroll were all designed into it. However, I called Kensington and they believe that Microsoft has all this and more in the new Vista program. Vista does however it is very costly to add every piece of hardware on to your machine (and find enough USB ports) that it takes to do what 1 piece did. Logitec just is not designed correctly, sorry. I have called Microsoft and wrote them, they sent me a CD that shows the wonders of Vista and the ""Enable"" site.Keep on with Kensington I think they'll change their minds about Vista the as they did with Windows ME."
1,Lame. I returned it,Poor build quality. Herky-jerky ball rolling... Ring around the trackball is noisy plastic against plastic. Software to change horizontal scrolling is poorly implemented. My hand hurts after two days.
1,No Windows-7 64bit support,"The the trackball does not come with software, you have to download it from their website. The software comes with a six page PDF doc with instructions on how to install this on Windows 7 64bit. I printed these out and followed the to the letter, it will not install because Kensington does not have a digital signature on their own drivers, which I find somewhat concerning.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU RUN Win7 64bit!"
2,Don't but it to scroll,"I've been using Kensington Trackballs for a long time and I was looking forward to the new Expert Mouse, especially for it's scrolling wheel. I've been terribly disappointed. The new mouse is cheaply made and I know because I took it apart to try to lubricate it and make it work properly. The track ball itself is ok once you polish it with some wax. But the scroll ring is hopelessly cheap, has no bearings and is impossible to improve. It's stiff and hard to use. I honestly think that if they spent a dollar or two more on parts, it would have been marvelous.I will no longer buy Kensington products sight unseen."
1,Unreliable piece of junk,"I can easily use either a trackball or a mouse, but prefer a trackball because I have large hands and the trackball gives me greater control and sensitivity in both my work and my personal computer usage. The Kensington USB trackball seemed ideal, as the ball is larger than usual. I used the trackball continually for a year after I bought it, being careful to clean it regularly. Today, for no apparent reason, the trackball stopped working reliably -- sometimes not working at all and sometimes giving bizarre responses to my attempted use. Rebooting my computer, cleaning the trackball, reseating the cable, and all my other attempts to make it work were no help."
4,"A good trackball, but the slimblade is better","I was debating between this mouse and theKensington Slimblade Trackball USB 2.0 for PC and Mac, K72327US, so I decided to get both and compare. The Expert Mouse is a good trackball overall. I like the scroll ring, it definitely is better than mouse scroll wheels. The buttons are nice and the software makes them easy to configure. The movement is fairly good. However, I feel that in every area the Slimblade is an improvement. So definitely consider it if you're looking at this trackball."
5,Almost Perfect...,"Nobody makes a better trackball than Kensington -- absolutely no one! It took them a while to get on the optical bandwagon so I had to get by with Microsoft & Logitech products until the wired optical trackball came out. The wired version is perfect except that I keep running out of cord or I'm always tipping something over. The wireless model goes through batteries every couple of days and it's response time is slower and jerkier than the wired one. Hopefully, with time they'll make a wireless one that responds like a Microsoft or Logitech while keeping that sweet Kensington ""feel"". When that happens I'll be the first in line to purchase one"
2,No Vista Support,"No Vista 64 support. their website states ""do not install software on vista operating system."" dont know why that say that. it works fine on vista 32 with the ability to program buttons. 64 bit vista you can use the lower 2 buttons and the scroll wheel. they are too lazy to write the 64 bit drivers. go with logitech trackballs cheaper and work with everything including Ubuntu (Linux)"
2,Very disappointed,"My Kensington Expert Mouse (of the previous generation) finally bit the dust and Kensington was nice enough to give me a replacement - only since they didn't make the Expert Mouse Pro (64213) anymore, they sent this one, which replaced it. I hate it. It KILLS my hand, which suffers from RSI. I had no problem with the previous version. I blame it on being optical. Sure, less moving parts, but they move so weirdly. No matter what setting I used (you can change speed, etc. with Kensington's Mouse Works software), it still was like pushing that trackball through molasses. Didn't feel responsive. Plus, they got rid of the extra 6 macro keys that were handy for launching my favorite apps. Still searching for a good trackball that won't kill my hands. Now I'm wary of all ""optical"" ones."
1,Don't buy if you have a laptop running XP,"The mouse was great until I took my Dell laptop out of its docking station (which of course disconnected it from the Expert Mouse). At that point I had no mouse. The Kensington driver had apparently inserted itself in a bad place in the driver stack. To add insult to injury, the mouse was also gone when I returned the system to its docking station. To add further insult, the mouse buttons were not right even after rebooting. I had to navigate with keystrokes to the Control Panel Add/Remove programs to unload the Kensington driver.Too bad. I was hoping that this product would help me with over-use problems in my hands."
1,Not for the things I do,I could not use this for my graphics........I need precise and the ball did not give me that effect.......its to loose.........it is a very good product for other things .....but not for me
1,HORRIBLE,"This mouse is terrible. I bought this when Microsoft discontinued the Trackball Explorer and mine stopped working. First of all, it is not comfortable or cool, its like a cell phone from the 80's 2) programmable buttons is a joke. If you want to program stupid buttons like ""back"" maybe, but if you are a hard core graphics person or a gamer, forget it. You can't program ""enter"" as a button, COME ON??? 3)The ball falls out, all the time. You basically need a separate desk for this thing is sit on....and maybe another hand to use it. 4) It is non-responsive, you set the sensitivity, it doesn't care, it forgets and does whatever, jumping around, stalling. DON'T buy this, I will sell you mine for $1 or give it to you if you have a Trackball Explorer. BAD BAD BAD 0 stars"
2,Might be fine for others,I bought this due to the fact that I am somewhat disabled and thought it might help. My condition makes clicks difficult to control. It is sometimes worse to use. The box came with no software. I tried to find something on line from them but kept saying not recognise device. Any way I am not saying a bad product just my experience was
5,Review of Kensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball,"This has been a great accessory for my PC. Easy to install, and setup. Modifiying the buttonsis a snap. The wrist pad makes a huge difference in comfort for long periods of use, and the scroll ring is awesome."
1,Software out of Date,Kensington states that Mouseworks software (the driver for this trackball) does not work with Intel based MacIntoshes. Elsewhere you will find critiques that say it doesn't work with Vista as well. Look at the dates on the other reviews here. One star is generous.
3,A great place to start,"Using this trackball has decreased my wrist and elbow pain greatly. However, in setting it up and using it I discovered that I need to have my wrist and lower arm supported in order to avoid pain altogether."
5,Great Mouse,"Works great on my system, makes things alot easier for me and is; in my opinion, better than the everyday run of the mill mouse."
1,"Disappointed, not for small hands","First of all, the buttons didn't work at all. This is on an XP machine where my other Kensington track ball works fine. But even if the buttons had worked there was no way I could reach the left click button with my thumb with my fingers on the ball. Just not possible and it wasn't even close. Disappointed and returning."
3,Review,Appears to be a very sturdy item but is way to big and bulky for me to handle. I bought it based on a recommendation without seeing one. You should actually use one to be sure it is what you want.
1,Disappointed,"Purchased the Slimblade model and have had no complaints. Purchased this model for a friend and it was nothing but trouble and was returned. Tried to install it on a computer running Windows 7 and first it would not work at all. Windows tried to download the appropriate software and was unable. The trackball works software, located at their homepage, would not download(error messages such as unable to copy or unable to locate) hence I was constantly getting multiple error messages, one atop another, and constantly being told to reboot the computer.I'm not a tech. type, but I went into the program files found the related files and erased them and then tried the process again. No changes. Very frustrating. As mentioned product was returned."
4,Kensington Expert Mouse,I find the use of the Kensington mouse very easy to navigate. I've had the older style before and I really like the wheel on the new model that allows you to manuever through documents.
1,Track ball,"Uncomfortable and works poorly on a MAC. Hate to say it, but it is headed to the garbage can. The ball slow to move, the buttons are not intuitive, and the directions poor. For a MAC I would stick to the track pad."
1,"good hardware, bad support and software","To protect my wrists after decades of keyboarding, I finally gave in a bought a Kensington Expert Mouse trackball with scroll ring and 4 buttons. I figured I could easily configure the upper two buttons for internet forward and back given the vendor's assurances of total configurabilty.Wish I'd read the forums instead of the product listing which said this is Vista compatible. IT IS NOT. Though the trackball, scroll ring and two primary buttons work quite well as a regular USB mouse device, the Kensington software installed on Vista will crash if you try to configure the buttons or access any of the advanced functions you pay so much for on this pricey mouse.Short story: If you have Vista, or plan to get Vista, avoid this product and vendor. Their short-sighted and confusing refusal to support Vista says they aren't a good future bet for hardware."
2,Ruby Ball Issue,"If you clean the lint and lose one of the 3 pin-sized ruby balls, the whole unit must be replaced. Save your receipt as you will need it. Otherwise, the model K64325 works very well."
2,From glad to sad,"A couple of years ago I would have highly recomended this product. Last year I bought a new 64 bit computer with Windows 7, and the problems have never ended. The software is unstable with Windows 7. Kensington technical support has gotten to the point of being useless. No fix in sight. Sad."
5,Outstanding,"It does not matter if the world is perfect, some people will always find a fault. I had a kensington track ball back in the eighties, great product and still works. I have just acquired this new model and I am delighted. Precisied, smooth, four buttons (programmable), scrolling capabilities (what noise?), fast and most of all very comfortable. Trust me, I have been in the IT hardware business, maufacturing and sales, since 1975. Well before PC's and mice. Well done! Strongly recommended."
5,Kensington Roller Ball Mouse,"A fellow co-worker had used this mouse and I thought she was crazy. This isn't necessary, I thought. When she left the company, I inherited the mouse and thought I would give it a try. Now I won't work with out it. I have since taken a new position and am now working from home and needed to buy one for my home office. It is awesome. Highly recommend!!!! You'll never go back to the tradtional mouse."
4,Great product!,"Great product, the best trackballs out there. I had a customer support issue that was resolved after I escalated it a bit. If you have any problem with customer support, make sure you contact the US office, as their off-site support can be spotty. They need to improve the drivers for Windows 7, but I understand it is in process."
4,Kensington expert mouse,"I do audio editing. I spend as much as 10 hours a day,using a mouse. I average probably 4 hours every day.I always use a track-ball type of mouse for control. I started getting hand pain,and needed to get the most comfortable mouse I could find. This may be it.If somebody knows a better one, let me know ! I still have some pain,but it has helped. It is a very big unit,and takes a bit to get used to.The attachable pad is a good feature. I like the assignable pads,and the scroll wheel."
2,Bad ergonomics,"Great Trackball, poor design. Using the Trackball makes you bend your wrist backward too much. The top of the ball is quite a ways above the table making it awkward to use. The Trackball system is excellent. The pad supplied does not raise the wrist anywhere near the right height to use this comfortably. You need almost a 2 inch thick pad. You could raise the area in front of the Trackball a couple of inches, but the unit is expensive and that shouldn't be needed."
5,Best pointer device I've used,"I have used what seems like every mouse and trackball on the planet in my 15 years in IT, and this is the best one yet. Taking the lessons from earlier trackballs, they designed this one with laser optics instead of the standard rollers, and the change is noticeable. It has excellent precision contral, the extra-large scroll wheel makes scrolling even more effective, and the large buttons are easy to reach and click. I have bad wrists and with this device I keep my hand still and just wiggle my fingers - much better than a standard mouse.I use this trackball to game with as well as real work, and it's great for that too. Someday they'll make a pointing device that's better, but they haven't yet."
3,Do Not Buy,"I thought after reading other comments about this item that I'd give it a try because it is just the type of trackball I need. I would say that was a mistake. DO NOT BUY. The scroll ring is not very smooth to operate, the scrolling is jerky, and when I called tech support, they said to wait a couple of weeks and it would work itself in. That is crap. For this kind of money, it should be smooth as silk out of the box."
5,Yeah Buddy!,"I just unpacked my expert mouse and my life is already better. It changed my life with in the first ten minutes of using it. I do a lot of work in Pro Tools, Logic, and Reason and its going to significantly speed up my work flow. Also its much easier on my hand. Great product!"
2,Go with the Kensington Orbit!,"I ordered both theKensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball for PC or Mac 64325andKensington K72337US Orbit Trackball with Scroll Ring for PC or Macand I will shortly be returning the expert mouse. I have trouble with my wrists and thought a trackball might help to alleviate some of the computer stress I get from working all day. The Orbit Trackball is shaped perfectly and keeps your wrist in a nice neutral position. I like its ambidextrous design so I can easily switch between my hands. While the trackball on the Orbit was sticky at first, there is no need to grease it as some of the previous reviewers suggest. I used it for about 15 minutes and now it moves quite freely.My complaint about the expert mouse is that it puts your hand in a really awkward position. After a day of use I felt like I had been using a regular mouse for a few days. I would definitely go with the cheaper option here, this mouse is terrible on your wrists!"
5,Great relief for carpul tunnel,"I have one at work and at home now. My right hand was going numb, so now I use the roller ball with my left hand. Not a big deal, like it very much never will go back to a mouse."
5,ball mouse,"Gave this product 5 stars, if I could give more, I would. This mouse is the only mouse anyone should use. Other mouse's you have to move around should be abolished. Why anyone still uses them is beyond me. You want a really good mouse...the way a mouse should be...get this one."
1,not Vista compatible,I got really excited about the four button feature but it does not work on vista. I can see that angle of the hand would have given me problems too.
2,Not compatible with Vista; Angle makes my hand hurt; Loud Clicks,"Let me begin by saying that if this product cost $20 I would give it one more star. The price at $80 is outrageous for a product that has software that hasn't been updated since 2006 (and that's from the Kensington website).Mouseworks will not work with Vista so don't try it unless you check on their website for an updated version of the program. The mouse works without it but you won't be able to program the buttons.The ball is at an odd angle where my hand is constantly strained even with the wrist support.The entire mouse looks outdated, clunky and cheap in my humble opinion. It looks like a mouse you would use with Windows 98 back when it was a new OS. The fact that Kensington doesn't bother updating the product driver and software makes me think it's a rip off to ask for such a high price. I returned it and will try theLogitech Trackman Wheel Optical (Silver)"
5,Kensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball for Mac 64325,"Quality merchandise at a very attractive price. Item showed backordered at first, but then arrived only about 3 days past its original expected date. Communication from seller was also excellent; I received both e-mail and phone-mail messages confirming order specifics."
2,Does NOT work with Microsoft VISTA O/S,I have been using Kensington trackballs going back to the early 90's. The quality and workmanship has always been outstanding. I just received the USB trackball and it does NOT and is NOT made to run on MS Vista. The web site has some song and dance that it does and shame on their management for posting that it does. The shipping box and appliction CD does not have the MS Vista compatiblity LOGO. The application program that maps the buttons and allows full functionally was written for Windows 2000/XP. When loaded it is not reconized as a Kensington Trackball and only partial use of the feature set are usable.
5,Great Mouse!,This mouse performs all necessary functions. This unit is as described. Iwould definitely recommend this model. Very easy to use.
2,Surprisingly Cheap Feeling for such an expensive device...,"I know many on here love this trackball, so please don't flame me. I bought this today and set it up. I was shocked at the flimsy, cheapy feel of the scroll ring, and of the motion of the trackball itself. I was not at all impressed, for 100 bucks. I'm returning it."
3,Great hardware - Horrible software,"I run Windows 7 64-bit. The software stinks. I use it without the software.I love the scroll ring and that it has a right mouse button. Some applications require these. Though, the scroll ring moves a little rough, and when you scroll, it goes rather slowly. Also, when you press a button, the clicks are very loud.And why did they get rid of the extra buttons on the top with this newer model? Those are selling used for like $400 now. Why did they get rid of that?The price is too high. It's made out of plastic. Come on. Keyboards have more plastic and parts and cost less.Note: I had to plug the mouse into a high-powered USB in the back of the computer because it wouldn't recognize it in the USB hub."
1,junk,I don't know what happened to Kensington - been using their trackballs for years - now the i have lion i'm stuck with this poorly made and badly operating piece of junk
4,Kensington Expert Trackball,I bought this as a replacement for an older Expert Trackball that I finally wore out. It is a nice upgrade.
5,Worthy Product,"My wife is a heavy mouse user and she has wrist problems. Had this for two years now and she loves it--worth the cost, we had bought cheaper ones and they barely lasted a year."
2,Vista Owners Beware!,"The requirements say: ""Windows 98, XP or later"". What they DON'T tell you is that the software that makes this trackball so special (by being able to asign VERY cool actions to individual buttons) will NOT work with Windows Vista. So...you pay a hundred bucks for Trackball with a vast array of features, and what you get is a very simple, very basic, Right click/Left click mouse with a scroll ring. PLEASE save your money if you're running Vista."
4,Great Trackball,"I love the smoothness and precision of this mouse. It's the best I've ever used. One star off, since I'd prefer a slightly smaller version for those of us without giant hands."
2,Not up to the traditional Kensington quality.,"This is my third Kensington trackball in the last 15 yrs.It's the worst one too. Kensington also doesn't support MouseWorks for the Mac anymore and no plans to update it for Leopard. I didn't try to install it. The lower buttons work right as a normal click and right click. The upper left button does something odd with the scrolling that I find irritating. The upper right button... well I don't know what it does.The scroll ring is very nice and it's nice not to have to clean the rollers of the old trackballs (this one uses the red IR LEDs like modern optical mice do). Beyond those two points, there's nothing nice to say here--If you're buying this expecting 1980s/1990s ""TurboMouse"" quality, you'll be disappointed.But if you're like me and need some varied input devices to keep your hands from aching with RSI from a single type of input device, this might be an OK purchase. Otherwise, you'll probably wind up returning it."
2,Not a worthy sucessor to the Turbo Mouse,"I thought this was going to be the perfect input device. After all it looks like the old Turbo Mouse (v. 4 &5) and it does have that ingenious scroll ring. But after a few hours I packed it up and returned it.While it does look right, it doesn't feel right. The old Expert and Turbo mice had a steel ball bearing movement that felt great: smooth and steady. While the new Expert Mouse 7 may have better technology (optical tracking) it doesn't feel the same at all. Upon closer inspection you'll see plastic nubs that support the main track ball where there used to be steel rollers. While I'm not advocating that they lose the optical sensor I don't see why they couldn't have kept the steel wheels that gave the unit such great feel.That being said, it does look great and the scroll ring is also very nice. I just wished they hadn't changed what made the old Expert/Turbo mice so great."
1,Vista incompatable,"this does not have the Vista Compatable logo, and is not recognized by the operating system. It appears none of the Kensington trackballs are.The Kensington software does not run on Vista, the Kensington website indicates the Mouseworks software is no longer needed because of Vista.However, this mouse is not recognized. So, if you are a Vista user, stay away."
2,"Seems acurate, but is stickey, flimsy","I had just bought the Kensington Expert Mouse. My first impressions were that it was huge and bulky, but since others gave it good reviews, I decided to buy it. The unit is flimsy and feels very cheap. The ball sticks (not high resistance, it sticks). The scroll wheel also needs much improvement; I can hear it grind when using it and the resulting scroll is very jumpy. Also, you have to push the buttons much past the point where it ""clicks"" in order for it to register the click. I would not recommend this product for others."
2,way overpriced for such a plasticy flimsy item,"I bought this mouse with high hope as I played with an older Kensington big trackball mouse several years ago. This mouse, in contrast, is much lighter. The ball has good weight, but the body feel very light and flimsy. The worst part is the feel of the scroll ring. It is not smooth. You hear it and feel the friction as you move the ring. The wrist rest is comfortable though.Overall, it's a workable mouse. But it cannot justify the price. I am not sure where you can find the older Kenginston mouse which felt more substantial."
4,Mac users beware!,"Kensington driver for the Mac has not been updated since 2006 and is not compatible beyond OS 10.6. Compatibility may be obtained for OS 10.7 by installing Rosetta from the OS 10.6 disk. To install Rosetta insert your Snow Leopard disc, open the Optional Installs folder on that disc, and double-click the Optional Installs.mpkg package. The Installer will open and you'll be prompted to click Continue a couple of times and then choose a destination for the installation. Choose your startup volume and click Continue yet again. In the Custom Install on ""name of volume"" window that appears, enable the Rosetta option and click Continue. In the next window click Install to do just that. If you're using OS 10.8 Rosetta will not install.The Track Ball is 4 Star great ( only the scrolling ring doesn't work well) but disappointed in Kensington for dropping driver support on newer OS releases by Apple. I personally would not buy anymore Kensington products."
3,Great product with no software,"This is a really nice product that has been around for many years, it has a lot of fans and rightly so.However the supplied drivers are soooo old its unbelievable, so if you have Win7 [or Vista] you cannot install the old Win2000/XP drivers. This means you cannot program the buttons rendering them pretty useless and limiting the overall functionality of this relatively expensive input device.However there is hope as there are beta drivers out there that look pretty good and have to be close to release now. In fact if you search forums hard enough you can find them to download without waiting for an invite from Kensington [which I still do not have]. With the new drivers installed this product makes sense again and can be recommended."
3,Not quite what it used to be,"From a standpoint of hardware, this has always been a terrific trackball. The used to produce really award-winning software to drive this thing. Not so much anymore. I use the basic Windows Mouse Driver with this gadget. For those of you suffering from repetitive motion syndrome of either the wrist or shoulder, this trackball is wonderful. I only wish that they hadn't cheapened up the software. I am using Windows 7 and the supplied software is so buggy as to be useless.Sincerely,MM"
3,"Good for some, not for others","I'm sure this trackball works very well for many if not mostusers. However, I find the placement of the buttons awkward,making dragn-n-drop problematic. I've used trackballs before, thisis the closest to being a good fit, but it still isn't there.After a week of heavy use (mostly code development and navigatinga graphical database in a Linux environment) I've retired thewidget.a) There appears to be no convenient place to put MB1. Thedefault position (lower left) means that the thumb is the MB1clicker. Bad choice for me. YMMV.b) The placement possibilities for MB2 (the most frequentdrag-n-drop in my environment) make moving the ball and holdingMB2 at the same time a bit of a trick. It can be mastered, butthe ergonomics weren't good for me. YMMV.c) My thumb started to hurt. YMMV.If not for the fact that I click buttons often, this wouldbe a good fit for me. Alas, it isn't."
5,Perfection,"Anyone that needs a track ball mouse should definitely take this one into consideration. It is easy to use, easy to customize, and carries the Kensington brand name, one you trust. I give it a thumbs up!"
4,Great Pruduct,"I've been using this trackball for about a month, and love it. I bought it to alleviate RSI and so far, it's working. I've tried it with WindowsXP and Ubuntu Linux 8.10 and it works very well in both. I was a little afraid that it would take a while to adapt form a mouse, but it took no time at all. In fact, after using it for a few hours, I didn't want to use another mouse ever again. The only complaint I have is that the scroll ring (which is a REALLY useful and intuitive feature) feels...well... cheap. That being said, the ring is still quite functional."
5,"Works fine, just like previous models","Just like the Kensington Trackballs sold for the last 15 years, this new model works just fine, albeit, using a new and different technology. Time will tell if it is durable as the 12 year old unit that the new unit has replaced.The new unit has a scrolling ring. I will need to practice to get used to using it, as one can still scroll using the old method."
5,Enjoyed Greatly,I really liked this book. Had so many twists and turns that I didn't see the guilty party till the end. Enough said. THanks
3,A very basic screen with clasps on the sides.,This is a very basic and practical screen. It does not have a tasteful appearance at all. It does the job.
2,A MESS,"Best known for the teen anthem, ""HOLD YOUR HEAD UP', this seems like band without direction. Sort of a combination Pink Floyd, Redeye, ELP, The Boston Pops,... Another worthwhile tune is ""Tragedy"", which sounds great in surroundsound. But a band oughta have a theme. And this one doesn't. At least it doesn't show here."
2,One good song,"Argent's song ""Hold Your Head Up,"" is the only decent song they ever wrote. They lucked into the charts on that song alone, and the rest of their stuff was pure high school garage band puke. Take away ""Hold Your Head Up"" and you've got a band capabable of embarrassing an entire generation. I was part of that generation, and believe me, I wasn't the only one who was convinced that virtually all of their other songs stunk to high heaven. If you want to wallow in how baby boomers celebrated their own mediocrity as the ""new horizon,"" then buy this album. Otherwise save your money for something that's worth listening to."
3,Bonus cuts save so-so Argent reissue.,"Certainly not their best album, All Together Now contains the '72 hit, Hold Your Head Up - which is probably this CD's sole reason for existing. The album on the whole is an uncoordinated hodge-podge of musical styles, and certainly doesn't measure up to the outstanding first two albums, Argent and Ring Of Hands (which amazingly do not exist on CD in the U.S.). In fact, it's the inclusion of several digitally remastered Ring Of Hands-era bonus cuts that makes this release worth having."
2,As Tall As Lions Shirt,"honestly, this product was not that great for a few reasons. First: they only offered one size which was completely inconvenient because i had to pay twenty more dollars to get it altered. Second: i could not get tracking info. i really hate that i never knew when my shirt was arriving.the only good thing about this order was that i really liked the design. it is so cute and i absolutely love that it is pink."
2,Surprised at the quality,"I was quite excited to receive this album, but was disappointed with the quality of the recordings and of John's vocals. Perhaps he was attempting to affect a style that was a departure from the original music, but at times the departure is a little too much. I did enjoy listening to the great writing that John does (as always). John's unique songwriting skills will never be duplicated."
2,A too-reverent and bland swaping of words,"This reads like a search-and-replace exercise in taking ""offensive"" terms and replacing them with watered down versions. As such, it is too straight and misses opportunities to (even in good humor) have fun with the absurd new meanings excessive political correctness could have injected into the parables."
4,"Funny, but possibly too irrevent","I wasn't sure about this book when I first picked it up. Was it going to be blasphemous about our Lord's life and works? I found the book to be a funny look at how silly, and stupid being ""politically correct"" is. It is somewhat irrevent about sacred things of God, but I think unless you are a extreme Christian Fundamentalist you will find the book well within the boundaries of not taking sacred things too lightly."
1,Lid makes this useless,"The lid just sits on top of the bucket. It doesn't snap on, just rests. Rather than put the pieces through the lid, my 15 month old takes the lid off and then puts the pieces in the bucket. Could easily be done with rocks and a bowl."
4,Good Toy For the Cost,Let's face it - Our kids have such short attention spans that spending a lot of money on individual toys is borderline criminal. I feel it's much better to buy more inexpensive toys than fewer big ones. These blocks provide my child with colorful play-things that keep her occupied just long enough for her to be ready to move on to the next. You can't go wrong for what you get for under ten bucks. It's a no brainer.
3,OK Toy,I purchased this from Target. My son likes it but just takes the top off and puts the pieces in. I guess it taught him how to do things the easy way. He also pinched a finger putting the lid back on. So we have to be a bit careful with this one.
4,You can't go wrong with Building Blocks,"Been there, done that. Who hasn't spent hours as a child sorting shaped blocks into their matching holes. This toy is one that makes us all human and gives us a childhood history that's related. An old time favorite of kids everywhere, it hasn't lost its charm and appeal."
4,Block,I always like blocks that show kids their shapes. it is a good product i would recommend to buy this but she just plays with the box they all come in or just the blocks never together lol but i like it.
5,"Love, Love, love","it's such a simple toy but all of my nephews love it, ages 1, 3, and 7. We bought it for the 1 year old of course and he has enjoyed it, but his brothers have also had fun keeping him company. This is a great developmental toy and I'd highly recommend it!"
4,Grandson liked it.,I got this for Christmas for our Grandson. He is one. He likes it very much.Well made and came in a timely manner.
2,Not the quality I expect from Fisher Price,The top does not snap on leaving it to spill constantly. The plastic seems thin and cheap. This product did not meet my expectations for quality usually associated with the Fisher Price name.
2,LID DOES NOT STAY ON,"Lid does not stay on. I bought this toy without looking at reviews. If I would have know that the lid does not snap on, I would have not bought it."
3,Loose top,"The top comes off too easily. A simple plastic bump would make it a little less easy to remove and still be accessible when the child wanted to remove it. At thirteen months, the child looks at you like, ""Why bother working to put it in the hole when you can just do this."" And shows you how to take the lid off. I will order the one another reviewer recommended. The child loves to carry this one around by the handle.I am allowed to mention that I am also an Amazon seller."
3,Lid... yeah....,"My son has never used this toy as a ""shape sorter"" as the lid does not stay on. He tries to sort for about five seconds, gets frustrated, takes the cover off and just tosses the blocks in that way. Even when I hold the cover on and try to get him to do it he gets mad cause he knows the cover actually does come off so he tries to take it off anyway as I'm holding it down. I like the colors and the shapes, however the toy is useless as designed. I found another shape sorter at Kmart for much much less and bought it for another child's birthday. It seems much better and will be getting one for my son very soon because he enjoyed it at the party so much and he was sorting the shapes because he didn't know how to open it up and throw the blocks in."
1,Why does the lid fall off?,The concept of this toy is great the problem is the yellow lid wont stay on. So when a kid goes to play with it the lid just falls off. kinda makes the toy just a bucket! I say go for one on these that has a lid that slides on and off not just falls off.
3,NEEDS A BETTER TOP!,I really should have taken heed to the other reviews... Got this for my 15 month old son....and while it is amusing to him...and he loves putting the blocks into it... he gets frustrated when the top keeps coming off... being the mum that I am - I got my handy heavy duty tape - and taped down one side.. so he can flip the top open/close as he wishes... but when getting the blocks through the shapes - I have to hold it down and guide him.... if it clicked or locked into place.. it would be a MUCH better toy.... but otherwise.. I'm happy with it..as long as he loves it.
1,Very Poor Design,Poor design as the top doesn't stay on. Full for dumping but doesn't teach them shapes if the top doesn't stay on to fit the blocks.
1,Get a different shape sorter,It's fine for putting shapes in and learning shapes and colors BUT the lid does not stay on. My one year old isn't learning how to sort shapes but instead how to put things in and out of a box as the first thing he does is take the lid off. I wish I had bought a different shape sorter.
2,Lid does not stay on,"Not sure if this is common for this toy or not, but the lid does not fit tightly. It is so loose that if you turn the toy upside-down, the lid comes off and the shapes fall out of it. And the fitting isn't tall, either, so it doesn't take much effort to dislodge the top even when it is right-side-up. Kudos for the educational value-- it's just not as durable as I need it to be for my active one-year-old."
4,Fun!,My 9 month old had so much fun with these blocks. She hasnt got the hang of putting them in the right spots but she loves to dump them and play with them!!!
5,Loves to build towers and knock them down,This has been my 9.5 month old's favorite toy for about a month. Mommy and Daddy build towers and she crawls over to disassemble them--sometimes taking it apart block by block and other times knocking them over with vigor. Smiles everytime. A must have toy.
4,loves the bucket,"My son plays with the shapes and he LOVES the fact that he can put stuff in the bucket and carry it around. He really hasn't gotten into the ""putting the shapes in the holes"" thing yet but he does play with all the parts even the lid. He likes the colors and loves to chew on the shapes. This toy is VERY durable. My son has thrown the shapes and the bucket and top down the stairs too many times to count. We have hard wood floors and there is no damage to the toy or the floors even with all the tossing from the top of the stairs."
3,"Good, cheap first block set, useless as a sorter","I bought this set for my daughter when she was 6 months old. She has had endless fun banging the blocks together, banging them on things, chewing on them, and putting them in and taking them out of the box. They are kind of hard to stack, due to the different shapes, but I've made many towers for her to knock down. It's a nice, cheap, basic set, but if you're looking for a shape sorter, look elsewhere. There's no mechanism to keep the sorting lid on, and any enterprising baby is just going to follow the path of least resistance and remove it."
4,Great Toy and Great Price!,"My baby is only 7 months old but this is quickly becoming her favorite toy to play with. As others mentioned, the lid does not snap on, but she enjoys pulling it off herself (and nibbling on it of course). This is the first toy she's played with that really seems to make her think. It will grow with her!"
1,the lid doen't snap on,"The idea is good, but my son always dumps the block everywhere in the room since the lid dosen't snap on the box.. not recommend to everyone"
2,Super small for its price,The blocks are really small so is the box i get its their first blocks but at Wal-Mart you can get a nicer size for like $10.00 So if your are not looking for a very small blocks then do not purchase. I guess its a nice size for younger ages but its just not what i wanted not a good bargen in my opinion. Expected alot better from Fisher-Price.
2,Buy a better shape sorter - one that can't be hacked,My baby can't be bothered with sorting the shapes to get the blocks in the box when all she has to do is remove the lid and throw the blocks in. Educational value is lacking. This toy would have been much more effective if the lid snapped on.She does really enjoy throwing the blocks in and then dumping them and starting over.
3,I've seen better,"Not that I was expecting the most amazing toy in the world or anything, but I was slightly disappointed. My baby basically ignores the bucket and just throws the blocks around. The main problem is that the lid comes off too easily. Because of this he's never taken the time to put the blocks through the lid, he just takes it off. I've seen other similar toys that would work better."
5,my 8 month old loves this,My son is into this toy...it actually holds his attention for some time unlike other toys. It also helps him learn his colors and shapes. I would recommend this toy.
5,Great Toy,"Great toy. Light weight. My 18month old loves playing with it. Teaches shapes, and colors and how to fit things into the proper hole."
3,Not Impressed,I don't like it. It's small and the lid comes off way to easy. I know that babies play with it and they should be able to get their shape blocks back out but in the process of her trying to put the shapes in there she knocks the top off.I'm looking for a better shape sorter.
3,Lid is a major problem,"I wish I had paid more attention to the reviewers who mentioned that the lid does not stay on. I have 14-month old twins and both enjoy taking the shapes out and occassionally putting them back in, but it is extremely difficult to get them to use the lid. It seems as if the lid almost just balances on top, there is no effort required to take it off. Sometimes, I can get them to try the sorter for one or two shapes, but then they immediately pull the lid off to take the shape(s) back out. I love watching them when they actually use the sorter, it is great to see their little hands trying to manipulate the shapes, but those moments are few and far between. They like to play with the shapes and box, but it doesn't serve its purpose in my opinion. If only they had made it with a lid that you could somehow fasten in place."
4,A good choice,"This was given to my 15 month old for Christmas, and he likes it a lot. He can get some of the shapes in and is still working on figuring out the others. He is fascinated by putting other toys in the bucket, and taking them out, and putting them in, and so on. It seems very durable, and I appreciate the fact that it doesn't make annoying and useless noise like so many children's toys do. The reason I didn't give it quite five stars is because he enjoys it a lot but doesn't LOVE it."
3,Wishing the top snapped on...,"I agree with the other reviewers who wish that the top snapped on. My daughter received this for her first birthday. After just a few minutes of playing with it, she figured out that it's much easier to take the top off and toss all of the blocks in the pail than to put them through the holes in the top. Unfortunately that pretty much defeats the purpose. I do like the simplicity and solid construction of this toy."
4,Retro,"Wonderful ""retro"" toy. No bells or whistles, but simple education in the guise of entertainment. I Like that it's self-contained"
5,Shapes and Colors,"My little Niece loves this toy. She is a clever little thing and likes to take the top off, but together we are learning shapes and colors. I love having 3D tools to practice with."
4,Great first toy,My twins have loved this toy from a very early age and still love playing with it. It's great for many stages
3,Wonderful,"Got this for my one year old boy. The only problem is the lid does not lock on the bottom part. After my son puts all the shapes in and wants to carry it around it tilts and all the shapes falls out. That makes he very upset. He loves putting the shapes in & figuring it out, but when it spills it upsets him."
5,Grand daughter super smart,with in the first day on her 1st birthday she figured out it was easier to take the lid off and take them out and put them back and shake them to make noise.
3,Okay,"As everyone else has pointed out, the lid doesn't stay put so of course, my son doesn't bother sorting anything---he takes off the top and dumps in the shapes. He likes throwing the pieces across the room and kicking the bucket so, even though he's no using it for what it was meant for, he's still having fun."
4,Great for my 6 month old,She was able to learn sorting shapes rather quickly with this. Soon after she enjoyed stacking them one on top of the other. Not very engaging but simple enough to learn. She grew out of it quickly though.. Good beginner toy.
1,Not as expected,"The lid with the shape openings doesn't click or snap into place in anyway. My kid just took if off and had more fun dumping the blocks in and out. He does like it, but hubby and I were very disappointed. Would prefer he had to go through the lid to fit the shapes, since that's sort of the point..."
2,Baby takes the lid off and then crawls away....,"The quality and colors are greatMy one major ""beef"" is that the top doesn't snap on. So when my son gets this toy he immediately takes the top off, dumps out the block and crawls away.There is no longer a purpose for the toy. Maybe I can fashion some kind of snap on device."
5,My Baby Loves it!,"My daughter loves playing with these. She likes the different shapes and colors. This is such a simple product, but that's part of what makes it so great."
3,it's ok,"this would be a whole lot better if the lid snapped on. My 11 month old just takes the lid off and walks around with it. I have put the lid on the floor and showed her how the peices fit into the lid, but she is more interested in carrying the lid with her;) the blocks get a lot of play. i have found them in most of her toys. it's an ok toy, but i think a sorter that didn't come apart quite as easliy would be a ton better"
3,Ok but fundamentally flawed,So my 9 month old son enjoys the blocks but like most other people who have reviewed this I am not real thrilled about the fact the top will not stay on this thing. He basically tips it over and everything just falls out of it. This toy would have a perfect rating if the lid would just snap on and stay on.
1,meh...,"my son really didnt enjoy the benefit of the toy. the top is easily removable, so he was more interested in taking it off and putting it back on rather than play with it the way its meant to be played with. two thumbs down!"
2,Don't know whats so much fuss about,"It would be great, but theres one feature that irritates the crap out of me. When you close the top of it, it doesnt lock or anything, so when the baby is actually trying to play with it and then accidentally pushes it, it falls and everything falls out and you have to put the top again. Its so easy to take it off. So instead of trying to put the little shapes in , my baby just takes of the top (which like I said is so easy to take of, you can literally blow on it and it will come off) and GAME OVER.I wouldnt recommend it."
1,The lid refuses to stay on therefore the toy does not work,What's the point of a shape sorter if the lid will not remain in place? My daughter has zero interest because she'd rather take the lid off (and if you bump it if FALLS off)and hand it to me then play with actually putting the pieces where they go. We received this as a gift and if I could I would return it and get a similiar toy that actually works.
3,Lid doesn't snap on,"My son, aged 13 months, will humor me and put a few shapes through the slots... then will throw the lid off and dump the rest in one by one in the bucket. If the lid could snap on and STAY on this toy would serve its purpose. However, it was more fun for him when he was smaller and just enjoyed taking the lid off and carrying around the blocks. For the purpose of sorting it's useless since most babies will figure out how much easier it is to just take the lid off first!"
2,Why can't the lid lock on?!,"So far, mostly all my 15 month old son has done with this toy is dump all the pieces out. Sometimes he puts the pieces back, but certainly not with the lid on. Why doesn't FP make it possible to lock the lid on so he can spend some time trying the different shapes holes instead of just tearing the lid off (even when I try to hold the lid on)? If the shapes are different colors, why didn't FP color coordinate the shape holes?I'm giving this product two stars because there are pairs of the different shapes and he likes to pick up the matching pairs and bang them together."
2,Lid won't stay on,"My daughter enjoyed this for the first five minutes, but once the container was full and we went to empty it, we couldn't get the lid to stay on. It will stay briefly if you lock the blue handle over it, but then kids can't see all of the shapes. There are much more fun shape sorters out there that actually work for more than a few minutes."
2,We returned it...baby was bored.,"Originally I bought these as ""first blocks"" for our baby (6 mos old) but ended up returning them since they're not very fun and pretty pricey for how cheap they are. For younger babies who aren't sorting yet, I recommend getting ""HABA First Blocks Set""First Blocks, a bit pricier, but very good quality (safe wood, NOT made in China). These are captivating blocks that are very imaginative. True, they don't have the sorting qualities like this toy might, but are visually stimulating and can be stacked and use to actually ""build"" things."
3,different,I had one 30 years ago for my child and wanted one for grand child. the old one had a HINGED lid and several sides to put all different sizes and shapes. this will have to do. baby gets the toy tomorrow
4,Good toy for a wide age range,"I bought this toy for my grandson to play with while at my house. At 8 months he didn't do anything with it at all... I took the lid off and he did throw a few shapes into the open bucket. If you are worried about any chemicals, this would not be the age to give it to your child. I am not too concerned about that, as he really hasn't put the pieces in his mouth much.Now, at almost 14 months, my grandson is just starting to try to fit the shapes through the holes in the lid. The lid does not snap on.. and doesn't stay on well if the child knocks the toy around at all... however, it sure isn't a problem for him to take the lid off of the bucket when he wants to! I believe later on he may like to carry the bucket around with toys in it.. So, I think we will get a lot of use out of this toy. Definitely worth the money."
3,Nice toy,Purchased for a one year old girl. The child was not really interested in it. The toy was made well it just didn't go over well with my daughter.
4,woooow,my son liked it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ......
3,good,"good but could def get something better, doesn't really catch.her attention as much as it should... She just likes to carry the bucket like a purse lol doesn't care much for the shapes"
5,A classic,My daughter loved these when she was little so I though it would be a great gift for my nephew. Even if they are too little yet to put the shapes in the box they still really enjoy playing with them and my daughter would remove the lid and just carry around the bucket.
2,Lid doesnt stay on....,"This toy would be much better if the lid stayed in place. As soon as 9mo old touches it it flops off. Therefore she can't really experiment with fitting the blocks into the holes properly....Mine could be a defect. I'm not sure, but I'm disappointed."
5,my son loves it,"I ordered thos toy for my 19 month old son. After I ordered it, I read reviews about children just taking the lid off and putting the shapes in and out. After I read them reviews I thought for sure I would be returning this toy. But my son loves it. Yes more than not the lid is off but if I sit with him and put the lid on he will put the shapes through the lid. Also I have caught him putting the lid upside down on the floor and placing the shapes in the correct whole which makes the toy still serve its purpose. All in all I am happy with the product. Do I think the lid should maybe be a bit of a better fit to the top so it is not so easy to pull off...sure. but for the money I can't complain"
3,Not as exciting as I expected,"The lid doesn't stay on at all, so my daughter just carries around the pieces. I was thinking they would have something to secure it instead of the lid just setting on top."
2,Lid doesn't stay on,My biggest complaint about this toy is that the lid is EASILY removable. I bought this for my 6 month old and the first thing she does is takes the lid off and bangs it against the base. I was hoping there would be a latch or some way to secure the lid to the base so that she would focus on putting the blocks through the holes but we end up just playing with it without the base.
3,Ok for the price.,"This product was ok for the price but the plastic lid does not lock on, and for a one year old that means she just dumps the blocks out and throws them back in without getting the benefit of learning the shapes. It was ten bucks but I would not buy these again."
3,"Bucket of fun, but has a flaw...","This is a great toy for shape sorting, but I wish the top/lid would click onto the base/basket to really encourage sorting and matching of the shapes. It's too easy for the baby to just pull the whole lid off and throw all the shapes in the basket. Then, take the lid off to dump them back out. I like it, but I wish the lid would click on safely, somehow."
3,the toy wont close,this toy is nice my son really likes it but the lid wont stay close while he try to insert the blocks and its really annoying.i would send it back but my wife said she will deal with it
5,My son loves it!,Didn't think there was anything special to this toy but since my son is in speech therapy she uses one and I decided to purchase one so he could practice at home and he loves it! He plays with it a couple times a day and has gotten so good at it! It also helped him learn his colors!
4,Love this toy,My daughter loves this toy but the top comes off very easily. Wish it was harder to take off .
2,Nonsensical design,"This item can easily earn an award for the worst design. Seriously, whereas FisherPrice has many nice products, they seem to design this one without any thinking. The flaw is that the lid doesn't snap, so the child just takes the it off and plays with this sorter as with a bucket. Why would anyone try to figure out the right hole if the blocks can be easily put in and out after removing the lid? As a sorter, this item is completely useless."
1,**Major Lid Issue**,The lid does not fix to the body of the basket. It just sits on top with a notch over the handle connectors. The lid comes off at the slightest touch. As such it is close to useless.
1,Lid won't stay in place!,"Horrible design, lid won't even come close to staying on. He loves putting the lid and all the shapes in his mouth, but that's all it's good for."
3,wow...the lid doesn't want to stay on!,my daughter has no interest in putting the shape through its designated area..but bc the lid comes off with a feather touch she takes the lid off and puts them in..kind of defeating the purpose here...maybe a better design like..the bottom unlatches for the shapes to come out...and the lid is permanent?...
4,A Christmas gift,"I brought it for my grandson's first Christmas, I have not got to give it to him yet.He lives in another state. I like it and believe he will. It is a great gift to give a child."
1,Top does not stay on,The top comes off so easy that my 12 month old refuses to sort the shapes but simply takes off the lid and put the pieces in the bucket.
4,My daughter loves it.,I bought this toy orignally for my daughters [who's 8 months] first x-mas. I desided after to give it to her sooner as a toy. she loves it. yes obviously she throws and chews on the blocks but when she matched the shapes she gets very excited with herself.... however to many other reviews the lid on my daughters is fine fits and stays in place. i would suggest this toy for anyone who wants a small cheap entertaining toy for thier child
5,My Boy Loves It!,We visited my brother-in-law and his new baby had this block set. She really liked it and my 6 month old like playing with them too. So when we got home we picked one up. He plays with the blocks everyday. We are all pleased with this purchase.
3,Not The Greatest.,"We received this as a gift, and honestly, I am not impressed. My daughter is still a little young to be actually sorting the shapes (13 months), but she does like to play with the pieces. I wish they were a little bit bigger, because I am forever fishing them out from under the couch for her. I also dislike the fact that the lid doesn't snap on or attach in any way. If there was just a hinge, I would be a huge plus. It's hard to put this set away without having it spill everywhere when my daughter bumps it. I hate the fact that I put it up high a lot just so I don't have to deal with it.I think this toy would be better for an older child who could handle it more gently and use it for learning shapes, colors and spacial skills... particularly one who could find the pieces themselves! :)"
3,a nice addition to the toy box,Our little guy is only thirteen months old now so he doesn't yet understand getting the shapes into the right holes but there is time for that. So therefore to date this item is only used to occupy his attention playing while my wife and I try to get things done around the house. Just like all his other toys that he has in his toy box.It would be nicer if the top more securely attached to the box so that our boy would be more likely to try to place the blocks into the box through the holes rather than to just remove the top of the box each time.
4,A Truly Classic Toy,"Without question, this shapes box is a classic. For whatever reason, it has become our sons favorite toy. I'm subtracting one star because the lid shouldn't come off so easily."
2,How to fix sorter easily.,"So this sorter is okay, but has a MAJOR PROBLEM, fortunately, it is easy to fix.The major problem is the lid won't stay on, at all. Here is how you fix it:You will need: 8"" of twine or cord, 1 elastic hair band.Cut the twin in half. Tie one length into a loop with a knot going through the triangle and circle holes.Loop the hair band in on itself through the twine so they are now connected.Put the other length of twine through the hair band and blue plastic handle of the base box, and tie it into a loop going through the square and plus holes.Now the lid is held securely to the box by the tension of the elastic, and can easily be pulled open to removed the shape toys after the child puts them in.See pictures."
3,one problem,"The one problem with this toy is that the yellow lid will not stay on the box. It comes off so easily. My baby is not encouraged to try putting the shapes through the lid, since it falls right off. I wish it latched on just a little bit."
4,entertaining,"My 9 month old is more interested in chewing the shapes , tossing them in the bucket and pouring it out than to shove and sort the shapes into the correct mold. Overall, it's a fun toy and he enjoys it."
4,Serves its purpose,It is a simple toy that gets the job done and serves the purpose. It is nice that there are 2 pieces for each shape. I'm sure we will continue to use as language skills are acquired.
4,Decent Sorter,"My 4 month old daughter likes this toy, not so much for the sorting function yet, but because the blocks are easy to handle and she can carry/flip/throw the bucket around. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the lid not snapping on. Just to make it clear, when an adult is carefully carrying this by the handle, the lid can pop off. Every time I show her how a block won't fit in the wrong hole and then put it in the right one, she tries to interrupt me by taking off the lid to make it easier. Funny at first, but I wonder if this will delay it's true functionality until she's old enough to value the 'puzzle' aspect. Overall though, it's durable, easy to clean, and she seems to really like it."
4,Great Buy,I am really pleased with this toy. My son really enjoys trying to fit everything in the right place. I would recommend this to anyone with small children!
4,Blocks,I bought this for my grandson. My daughter had one similar when she was a baby & was very helpful in her shape recognition. I'm sure when my grandson is alittle older he too will have fun with it instead of just a chew toy.
2,"Great idea, but the lid is not well thought of","I bought this for my baby when he was 6 months old. He loved putting the shapes in and dumping it out. The lid only sits on it though so it becomes more of a game to keep the lid off. If the lid snapped on instead or latched or something it would be awesome, but since it doesn't it's just a bucket with shapes. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks,"BORING. My son will play with this for a few minutes and then he is done. It didnt take long to learn how to make the pegs line up and go in. It got too easy too quick, but for the price it was worth the lesson it taught him"
5,Son loves it still at age 2.5!,"Got this for my son when he was about a year. He has known colors and shapes since 18 mos. Not necessarily due to this toy, but it didn't hurt. He loves it still. It's a classic for a reason. Buy it!!"
1,Pointless,I am very disappointed with this toy and wish I had returned it immediately after opening. The stacker has practically zero functionality as the lid comes off almost immediately without any way to secure it to the base. Any child will just take off the lid instead of fiddling with stacking holes. Major design flaw!!!
2,Flimsy Lid Makes This A Joke,"I would avoid this toy. The lid falls off so your kid will just take the easy route and pull the lid off to put in the blocks. We have another one with a latched door to remove the blocks and no lid, and it makes it much more fun and actually makes my daughter do the sorting. Just skip this one and save yourself from more useless plastic junk in your house."
4,Manufacturere's photos aren't exactly to scale...,"This item is a great learning tool because of all of the shapes and colors and it helps a child work on spatial reasoning. That being said, the manufacturer's images make the toy look bigger than it really is when you receive it: when I looked at the images of the toy next to the babies, I thought this was going to be a little bigger than it truly is. I wish I'd bought it from an Amazon seller who had previous customers upload photos of the actual toy with their children, because those show the toy's truly compact size. My kid still likes the toy, so I'm not overly upset, but I probably would look for a bigger version of the same if I had the purchase to do all over again."
3,dissapointed,The lid came off too easily. Had to force the kids to leave it on to put the shapes in the holes.
5,Very Versatile Toy!,"My son got this toy for his 1st birthday, but at the age of 2, we are still having fun with it! When he was younger, he enjoyed watching me stack the shapes into a tower, and then he would knock them down. As he got a little older, he could stack a few of them (some of the shapes are a little difficult to stack). Eventually, he was old enough to tell me what the shapes are, what color they are, and where they go. And now that he can do all this at age 2, we have made our own game of sliding the shapes into each other up and down the hallway (the blue cylinders are EXCELLENT at getting great weebly-wobbly spins)!!! If you've got an imagination, you can get a LOT of use out of this toy, and your child will learn lots, too!"
5,I can see her wheels turning...,"As my 14 month daughter works on getting the right shape in the right hole. It's true that sometimes she just gets frustrated and picks up the lid and throws the shapes in the bucket instead of sorting them, but when I play with her talk to her and ask her where each shape goes she really focuses and we get them together. She looks so proud of herself when she gets them right, too! But even when she is playing by herself and taking the lid off, it's still a very fun toy for her to put them all in, take them out, and do it all over again!"
4,"Fun, but lid doesn't stay on!","My 8 month old has been playing with this for 2 months, and she LOVES it. She feels the shapes, chews on them, throws them, bangs them together, etc. However, she doesn't actually put the shapes through their correct hole. The lid comes off way too easily! She rips the lid off, bangs it on the red box, throws it, chews it, but never uses it as it is intended. Perhaps if the lid snapped on somehow she would learn how to put the shapes into the holes.I do use this toy to say the name of the shape and the colors, and I try to show her how they fit into the holes, but she's not interested.One good thing is you can wash them in the sink with soap and water very easily. You can't do this with a lot of toys."
1,Major design flaw -- I returned it,"I wanted a shape sorter for my 14-month old niece. I was excited to watch her play with this, but the yellow cover has absolutely no way of attaching to the container other than simply resting on top, so the minute my niece touched the toy, the cover fell off. I'm amazed that this toy was made without any sort of latch to hold the cover on while the toy is being played it. I returned this and am looking for something with a more intelligent design."
2,"Gets old fast, doesn't it?","I choseSmart Snacks Gingerbread House Sorterinstead because it's more versatile. It has a Christmas motif, it's prettier and may still be of some interest to an older child when they are playing cooking."
