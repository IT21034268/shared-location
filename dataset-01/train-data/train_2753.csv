3,A few bugs to work out,"This is a fairly cheap, good quality scanner. Mine, however, has one little problem: the little ribbon of wire that connects to the light bar often gets tangled when the light bar moves the full length of the tray (which it must do before ""starting a new scan"") . When it becomes tangled the light bar refuses to move and the motor makes a horrible sound. The only solution is to take it apart and untangle this jumple of wires. The images are otherwise high quality, just seems that the engineers were a little short sighted."
4,Better than the Sensitive Skin version,"Having tried the sensitive-skin type before, I ordered a pack of these after seeing that the sensitive-skin type was sold out, and have to say that I prefer these much more. Not only does this type have a cleaner feeling, my skin has never looked better since using this and it has pretty much eliminated the need to use a moisturizer after washing due to the dried-out appearance that you get with so many other types of soap. While the sensitive-skin bar doesnt necessarily leave you with dry skin, this type does a better job of moisturizing from my experience. On top of that, it has a very pleasant, very mild scent that is absent from the sensitive-skin bar and one bar of this seems to last quite a bit longer as well. I'd give it a 5-star if they weren't as expensive but the value is fairly good for what you get (really good-looking skin)."
5,great cleanser for sensitive skin,"Love, Love, Love this soap! I have extremely sensitive skin, oily, and I also have rosacea. This is the only cleanser that I have ever used that doesnt cause me to react to it.If you have very sensitive skin, try this cleanser. It leaves your face feeling clean and fresh and doesnt dry it out."
2,Plan On Some Moisturizer,"I ordered some of these Basis Vitamin Bars on the premise they would be less-drying than the Basis Sensitive Skin Bar I had been using for approximately the prior 4-5 days. Unfortunately I found the Vitamin Bar to be even more-drying than the Sensitive Skin ones. After 3 days of them I had to discontinue use and return the remainder. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy. Between the two Basis products (used only once AM/once PM) my skin is a dried-out, broken-out mess and it has never looked worse. They sure don't seem to be made for sensitive skin to me and I would proceed with caution using them. On the up-side, they both lather up very well and rinse very cleanly."
4,Good pitch pipe for practice,"This pitch pipe is great for individual practice. It's really nice to have such a great range of tones. The volume is loud enough to hear when I am singing to make sure I am not losing pitch. I had hoped my chorus could use it in place of the ones which are falling apart. Unfortunately, the pause button does not keep the pipe silent while changing pitches and makes it unsuitable for that use. Otherwise, the pipe is great and nicely priced!"
3,Don't Buy This (It's now a Free download),This software (Sharepoint designer)is now a free download from MS. They also said that for people that had bought it they would give a free copy of Expression web but they never said how to get it.Anybody know how to get the Free expression web?BTW Sharepoint designer can edit any kind of web page but only sharepoint designer edits Sharepoint.
2,"Good video, terrible narration","The video clips of construction machinery were pretty good but the inane narration plus the hard rock music detracted from the content of the video. 'Better (similar) video would be Fred Levine's ""Road Construction Ahead"" or Sandbox Video's ""Trucks, Tractors, and Trains"", which treat the subject in a more mature manner. My two year old also turned away from this one, mostly from the irritating sounds it made. 'Would have been better to hear the equipment sounds instead of the narrator and rock music."
5,Mighty Construction Machines,I have two toddler boys who love this movie. They ask for it every day. It seems the movie was made just for them.
5,good fun,"Mighty Construction Machines is a wonderful example of a video that engages the sight, hearing and imagination of a child. I have given several of these videos to friends with young children and all have loved it. Even the parents report that they enjoy watching it, especially to see their child's reactions and discoveries. I enjoy the sounds of the machines and the way the video naturally presents this childhood fascination with construction machines in a way that engages both girls and boys. This video is lively, interesting and just good fun. I highly recommend it."
2,I've seen better,"I've seen better children's videos about construction and trucks. The narrator of this one, a cheerleader-type apparently on one too many espressos, is quite irritating. Plus the presentation and titles look like they were done by a first-timer trying out every option the camera offers. My 2-1/2 yr. old -- who adores trucks and machinery -- avoids this title. We like ""Gus and Sam's Construction Adventure,"" which we found at Toys R Us."
4,Best Nintendo Game I've Played,This CLUE game is without a doubt the best ADULT sort of Nintendo game I've seen to date. It is much better than the original board game and it is designed for adults more than children but children enjoy it as well. CLUE keeps you guessing throughout and it can literally be played for hours and hours. IT IS A GREAT GAME!
5,love it,I love the game. it takes me back to when i was a kid. got here with in days and i play it almost evey day
1,"Play the Board Game instead, because this game is not even close",This game tried and failed. there is nothing about this game that would make you want to purchase it and play it even once. the Board Game is a million times better then the SNES version avoid at all costs. 1 star.
5,"Easy, enjoyable and immediate results.",My flexibility has decreased over the past two years due mostly to two car accidents. Physical therapy helped but I am still plagued by pain and find it hard to bend.I used this video for the first time today and felt immediate results. It was fun and easy. I want to use it every day. I haven't felt this good in quite some time.
3,"Different, not that bad though","I do not hate this album it shows that bone thugs have changed styles a little. fire, do it again and dont stop are all solid songs. only buy if you are a huge bone fan like me."
4,THE WAR IZ ON ( WAT U GON' DO),"FIRST THIS CD IS NOT THAT ALL BAD.SO YALL HAVE TO STOP HATIN' SAYIN' BONE SOLD OUT BCUZ THEIR BETTER THAN HAVE THA PEOPLE IN THE RAP GAME NOW. THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY SOLID. BUT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE SAYS IF YOU ARE STARTING TO GET INTO BONE THUGS. THEN U SHOULD FIRST GET EAST.1999 ETERNAL, THE ART OF WAR,BTNHRESSURECTION. AND SO ON. BUT PRETTY SOLID CD COULD OF DEFINATELY BEEN BETTER WITH LEGENGS LIKE BONE THUGS BUT PRETTY SOLID NO MORE NO LESS"
3,I Still Got Luv...BUT...,"I listened to this CD the 1st time and I was like ""what is this"". So then I attempted to listen to it again and I've come to this conclusion... Bone has talent and their style will always be there own...but maybe it's time to upgrade the production. Krazie's appearances on various artists' music shows that they can advance with the change of different production. I just felt like this CD was not their best and I know they can do better. Naturally I am always going to support them because they're from my city...hell my neighborhood! But I think with different beats and production Bone can shine like they use to."
4,The Schernoff Discoveries BY Gary Paulsen,I feel that the book was one of my favorite books. I don't like to read but the book kept me reading no matter what was going on right next to me. The was an all around funny and entertaining book.
4,Shernoff discoveries,"I rated this book four stars not five because it skipped around too much. I mean don't spend 50 pages on one thing, just develop them more. I understand why it was short in areas because it is a childs book, but for the most part the book was funny; like when they went fishing and Harold ate worms. It was sad like that narrator's parents were drunks.I also liked that in a way it reflected Gary Paulsen's life and thats what I liked about it."
3,Geek Dicoveries,"1. In this book there was about five different chapters/discoveries and they were all kind of hard to get interested in.2. This book when I got finished with it I was kind of like happy that it was over. Sorry, Gary but this book wasn't very good.3. This book was a book that was mainly for the less popular people, (science freaks mainly) one part was how to get girls to like you, I thought if you can't get a girl to like you without you being yourself you shouldn't get one.4. The reason why I gave this book only three stars was because it was really hard to get into it."
3,a very intresting little musical for kids,"I saw this program on the Disney Channel, and I am a big fan of Alice, so when I heard about this I had to sit down and watch it. I thought it was so amazing and so wonderful to see the Disney Channel actually broadcast a musical like Alice Through the Looking Glass. Although I do have to regret that Julie's Rolan needs some singing lessons, and then she could sound like a nightengale. I think the guy who played the jabberwocky was pretty weird, but he was okay for a beginner. Tweedledum and Tweedledee were okay, but not the best. Still, your movie is not really a success, but if I were Siskel or Ebert I would give it one thumb up or two."
1,Terrible,"Horrible sixties TV musical of Through the Looking Glass, complete with terrible acting, cheesy sets and special effects, forgettalbly silly songs, and a complete butchering of Carrolls masterpiece. I thought that this would be a movie based on the book and was disappointed to discover that it was a cheesy sixties musical. Avoid this movie at all costs if you are looking for a movie based on Carrolls book. This is just a tepid sixties TV special, not a movie."
5,"This man sings ""MAGIC""","This man sings ""PASSION""...""LOVE""...and the list goes on. I fell in love with my daughter's father off his first cd ""COMPASSION"", ever since then i've purchased every cd he's ever put out. I am in touch with Mr. Taylor through his website ""Morningcrew"" and I knew of the cd being released. It is a must have and my sister ""HA_ZELL"" has her own copy too...*smile*"
4,same ol same,"I've just purchase Gary Taylor's latest effort. is it just me or does all his songs sound the same.NOW I must confess I have everyone of his Cd's,Theres just something that drives me to buy them.On Electic bohemian I Love the REMIX of women of color featuring The (voice Will downing) & Scotty Scott Of the whispers .And the instrumental version.Is just wonderful and for this reason I'll give it 4 stars"
5,ELEGANTLY COOL!!!,"This cd is as cool as they come. Simply smooth all the way through. I love every song here. If you are thinking about getting this cd, stop and go get it. You'll love it. Ta ta..."
2,ok,"I was a little disappointed but cd isn't to bad, I think maybe because its christmas music. then again I have only listen to it 1 time because I ordered right after holiday."
1,not good,"Open box missing parts, I have to go to the hardware store to get the missing parts,. Not happy at all."
2,land of oz?,"I found about half of this book helpful to me in thinking of equine relationships in a more open way. There were some interesting real-life stories and theories presented for consideration. I thought the other half of the book was a bit too ""new age""y for me. The author's alleged connection to ghost horse ancestors was a bit much for me to swallow, but interesting to read about anyway. There seems to be alot of plugging her ""equine based therapy"" and patting herself on the back for having so many unusual and amazing experiences within her world with horses.....perhaps I am just envious of this transcendental level she has the ability to frequent....or perhaps I'm not as evolved...or maybe just looking for something a little more ""earth based""."
5,Reading is Believing,"One of the best books I have ever read. And I've read a lot. Exquisitely written. Profound in it's simplicity, and simply profound. Get it. Read it. Experience it. Love it."
5,Fabulous insight!,"Within this book you will find information about horses and spirituality and tools you can use to work toward freeing yourself from fear and inner turmoil. This book is worth it's weight in gold and after reading it, I could not wait to apply its insights to my own life and spirituality."
5,Best book ever read!,This wonderful book is the result of very thorough in-depth research of a woman who knows what she is talking about. It provides an insight of animal-human relationships and how people can use their encounters with horses to develop their own personality. It helps horse people to understand the specialty of interactions with horses and how horses reflect our feelings and attitude. Linda Kohanov is a great horse woman and has provided us with a very valuable book with plenty of further references to explore. Reading absolutely recommended!
4,Pretty good,"Very good, insightful & helpful book on horses feelings vs abused womens feelings. The stories are the best. The author has done her research well. She does go overboard intellectualizing the horse myth type things, though I imagine the rich white yuppie folk eat this stuff up daily and somehow feel better for it, which is probably why she can get such astronomical prices for her ""training"". Still it's a 4 star and I would read others by her."
5,Evoking Our Human Potential Through the Equine World,"Tao of Equus is a book that truly offers new possibilities for our understanding of ourselves as evolving human beings as well as our relationship with and appreciation of horses as intelligent, sensitive, intuitive partners in that evolution. After 15 years of personal and spiritual development, I gained new understanding of my human and spiritual potential and tapped into the power and possiblity of being facilitated on my journey by these amazing four-legged beings. Linda Kohanov has offered us a bridge between human beings and the other species of our planet.In reading through Linda's book, I became a more compassionate, mature, intuitive human being. As a result, the work I offer to my clients has deepened and become more potent for them, thus creating a positive ripple effect in the world.If you would like to discover more about yourself and the power and true inner beauty of horses, then The Tao of Equus is for you. Good journeying!"
5,Kindred spirits,"It was a pleasuring reassurance and detailed explanation of all the emotions, intuitions and love I have had for and about horses my whole life."
5,Powerful Beauty,This book was recommended to me by the owner of a horse farm and I am ever so grateful! The spirit of a horse is beautifully detailed in this book. Some of us are touched by the spirit of a horse and understand completely that a horse is indeed majestic. If you understand the horse/human/spirit connection then you will enjoy and appreciate this book.
1,I should have came here first,"To read the reviews. I thought I was going to get a really insightful look into horses, based on the title, the cover. There's not a lot of it about horses really. It's an autobiography and I think misleading about what it's about.So this isn't a well-written review but if you are wanting to read about the Tao of Horses in a spiritual way this isn't the book for you."
3,Anyone for an insight sandwich?,"I gained some very valuable insights into my horses' behavior through this book. Unfortunately, the insight was sandwiched between layers of complicated metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and shameless business-plugging. I completely agree with the idea that a close bond with horses can send one on a life-changing journey that transcends the physical world, but the descriptions in this book of such phenomena are so heavy-handed at times that they become hard to believe. Ms. Kohanov is an excellent storyteller, and I very much enjoyed the accounts of her personal experiences with horses. Epona Equestrian Services is performing a valuable service through equine-assisted therapy, but some of Ms. Kohanov's prose reads like an advertising brochure.All things considered, I am glad I read this book, and the positive insights outweighed the negative aspects. Should the author choose to write another book, I would recommend more storytelling and less advertising."
3,Thoughtful but vague,"This book is intriguing as it encourages the reader to consider a deeper communication with the horse, but somewhat vague in terms of just how this communication works.Claire Dorotik, author, ON THE BACK OF A HORSE: Harnessing the healing power of the human-equine bond"
2,Neat Ideas but...,"This book presents some fascinating ideas, but lousy arguments. Kohanov argues that horses have a healing ability because of their special ability to see auras, communicated across distances, and similar reasons. I was extremely annoyed by such reasoning. Auras have no reliable, emperical data that I have been made aware of (if such evidence exists, please show me) The idea of morphic fields strikes me as silly, once again, no data! However, on the up side, the idea that horses are valuable as therapuetic tools, I agree with, but the argument can be made substantially stronger."
1,Couldn't Get Into It,I got to page 49 and went in search of other horse-related material. I just couldn't get into this one. It wasn't my forte.
1,great!,wonderful book. highly recommend. i love horses and spirituality and psychology. this has it all.
2,Reader Beware!,I was very disappointed in this book. It seems to me that anyone can write a book these days! The author has no formal education in psychotherapy. Am I the only person that is a critical reader?
5,Into the Horse's Mind,"Learn how your horse thinks in this spiritual guide to horse training. You'll have a greater understanding of horse psychology and thus, a deeper relationship with your horse."
2,Very misleading title,"I had to get 1/2 way through the book until she made any reference to Tao. Plenty of research and facts, and plugging her business, but she is also very down on men (I'm female). For me the book doesn't deliver what the title led me to expect."
2,The Tao of Equus,"I bought this book hoping that I was going to learn something about communication with my horse based on the authors own experience and personal journeys but as it turns out it is more of her own difficulties and it seems like the horse is more along for the ride. I think the book has the wrong title. It should be the Tao of Linda - then it would make more sense and be helpful to people who are trying to deal with inner problems. The title is misleading in that you think it is about the way of the horse itself.It is well written, but not what I was looking for or expecting to read."
2,"Enough of the preachy, repetititve stuff","I picked this one up, based upon the mostly favorable reviews. I enjoy reading accounts of people who have been able to connect with their spiritual natures, whatever the medium.And there is some interesting material -- maybe 50 pages of interesting information. The other 300 pages are extremely repetitive, and sadly, just like many other new-age books, preachy. This could have been a wonderful book, had the author simple recounted her experiences with horses. But, unfortunately, she launches into tirades. It's just not worth sorting out the gems from the weeds."
4,Untitled Review,I am not a big fan of psychoanalysis so some of the psycho-talk is boring and over my head. But I really relate to the emotionality of her stories and the people and horses involved.
4,Pretty Solid Watch,"This is a great watch. Good looking and has all of the gadgets and gizmo's that I needed in a watch. The only thing that would make this watch even easier to use is if the button that lights up the time would have a bit of a glow so you can find it easier when looking at it in the middle of the night. Other than that, a fabulous buy!"
3,Very Nice Watch,"I bought this watch specifically for my workouts and to be worn as a casual accessory. I use the stopwatch feature and that is about it for now. Setting up the watch can be a little tricky. The world time on my watch is wrong and is difficult to fix.Other than that issue, I love the look and feel of the watch. I would recommend this watch to anyone who is looking for a sleek casual sports watch."
3,The clear jelly stripe became yellowish,"I bought this as a present to my little sister. She loves it at first but as time flies, within a year, the watch's stripe turned yellowish. The clear jelly stripe obviously is not clear now."
3,DON'T GET THE CLEAR MODEL!,"I bought this watch for my wife a while back. I love G-shock watches. They work great and are extraordinarily tough. The problem with this particular model is with the clear material that the case and band are made out of. It turned yellow very quickly. My sister-in-law bought the same watch, and hers turned yellow also. The solid colored g-shocks don't have this problem.I highly recommend this watch, as long as you don't get the clear model."
4,My Wife Loves Her Watch!!!,"Casio Women's Baby G Shock Resistant Clear Sports Watch #BG169-7VI am a huge Casio G-Shock fan. I purchased this watch for my wife and was a little worried that she was not going to like it. I am happy to report that she loves it! Good size and weight. The watch looks much better in person. Has more white and silver accents. One of the more cute features is that when you turn on the back light a little dolphin animation pops up in the upper left hand corner of the watch face. Very cute, the kids love it."
3,Not as good as the others,This book wasn't as good as the others in Mary Jo Putney's series. I found I was uninterested in the characters and simply finished the book just to see if anything interesting would happen. Still an okay read.
4,Comfy little sneaks...,These are pretty comfortable shoes. I like the style and materials used as well. It's a shoe that I can wear all day as long as I'm not on my feet all day. I wouldn't spend an entire day shopping in them for instance. But they're cute (I got the gray ones).
4,Seems OK,"The case is stylish, but not as secure as some sort of zippered pouch. It closes with a magnetic snap, and I did a few shake tests to see how well the camera will stay in there - and the snap WILL come loose with moderate shaking - and the camera flips right out. I don't think I would jog with this case on my belt.It feels solid enough to provide a cushion for the camera if it is dropped while in the case. It will probably protect the camera fairly well, but the sides are open, so using the case inside a backpack or purse will provide less protection for the camera than a zippered pouch would.I have not had any trouble accidentally hitting the camera power-on switch while inserting or removing the camera as one other reviewer noted."
3,"It's ""OK""","Nicely made, and I like the pockets inside the flap for extra SD Cards. It would be better if the elastic on the sides were higher. On one occasion, the camera fell out when I bent over when the flap wasn't smapped"
3,"Ok case size-wise, leather doesn't feel real","The size of the case is perfect for the camera alone, but if you want to add any other camera accessories to the provided pockets (I only tried to add a memory card and a very compact spare battery), the case cannot be snapped shut. The so-called leather does not smell or feel like real leather, though the material does not scratch."
2,"Looks great, doesn't fit (EX-Z700).","This case does not fit an EX-Z700 very well at all. You have to really force it to get it to snap closed. I wish I would have tried other cases before buying this one.It says it's for the ""S-Series"", but Amazon said it would go with my camera and I trusted them.On the plus side, it looks nice. I would be very happy with it....if it worked for my camera."
2,"Looks great, doesn't fit (EX-Z1080).","Nice looking case, but doesn't fit my EX-Z1080. Nice pockets for credit card and 2 spare memory cards, but it is a real struggle to get this camera to fit in the case. I was hoping the leather would stretch a bit after squeezing the camera in, but the magnetic closure won't hold it closed long enough to stretch it. Give me good old easy-close velcro any time. I decided to spend a few bucks more and get a roomier hard case."
4,Perfect S Series companion,"This is a great case for the S-Series Casio Exilm Camers. There is a belt loop on the back, so you have to undo your belt to slide the case on, but you will be sure it won't slide off accidently. It has 2 little pockets for extra SD cards. Nice case."
2,weak closure,The magnetic closure wasn't strong enough to keep the case from coming open accidentally. The camera kept falling out. I had to put in a velcro closure.
2,Too bulky...,"The case is great quality and fit to Casio s600 is great... However, the leather is quite thick and item is bulky which defeats the point of having an ultraslim camera. I ended up returning item and searching for something smaller..."
1,Make sure you have a Mac. Will not work on a PC,"Since there is not an adequate product description for this item, I figured I would save some people the cost and hassle of returning this item by quoting the package ( Which I did not open since I would not be able to return it if I did ). The package reads ""Video to USB for the Macintosh"" and the system requirements call for ""Apple iMac or Mac OS Clone"" I hope this helps. Since there was no information, I took the risk and I guess I got burned."
1,what a piece of garbage!,"I have a Mac G4/400, well within the requirements of this device. I hooked up my analog camcorder and tried to import to my Mac - choppy audio and slide-show video. This is not how the device is advertised and I was extremely perturbed.I used the software included, tried it in Classic and in OS X, and tried iMovie and any other type of import software I could find, and all results were the same.I threw it in a drawer and finally invested in a product that works as advertised, the Dazzle Hollywood DV-bridge (sold here on Amazon).Don't waste your money on this glorified dust collector!"
3,Are you sure it doesn't work on PC?,"I do not own this exact piece of equipment, but I do have a different one, and it works on both Mac and PC. All it really is is a way to import video from an RCA out device to USB. Win9x has a generic driver for this type of equipment, and it seems to work on nearly any device of this type, so, by not opening the package and trying it, yes, you did get burned. This is a great prie for one of these!"
5,The Artist,"Heart-rending, sorrowful, absolutely devastating. Her own sad, painful last years aside, this gifted singer could pack more controlled emotion into one phrase than many operas do in 3 acts."
3,Not nearly go good as Edith Pargeter,"AN EFFORT TO READ. MILITARY SEQUENCES DESERVE 4 STARS; BUT PERSONALITIES NEVER GRIP MY INTEREST NOR EVOKEANY INVOLVEMENT ON READER'S PART.A GOOD HISTORY LESSON, BUT DRY."
2,Disappointing,"The acting in this movie is truly lame. I was very disappointed when I saw it. Hawthorne's story is so interesting, but don't expect the movie to convey that interest. The accents are goofy (to say the least) and there are a few gaps in the story. I do NOT recommend this movie."
5,Very true to the story,"After seeing this movie, I had to read the story as well. The movie follows the story, and was very nicely done. The acting was superb, in my opinion, and the story grows on you the more you watch it. Overall, I give it 5 stars, for a beautiful love story set against a wonderful background."
2,Disappointing copy of a good production,"This is a wonderful production, which I have seen before, but this DVD looks like a bootleg. The picture is incredibly dark, so that what should be a colorful production, looks like it was filmed at night. I was very disappointed. If anyone knows where I can get a good copy, please let me know."
5,INCREDIBLY FAST SHIPPING!!!,"Home Gym Central ROCKS! Fastest delivery on the planet, even before Christmas. Ordered on the 18th and item deliverd on the 21st."
3,Needs some work,"""Machine is cheaply made cosmetically but gauge of the steal is fairly decent. The pad is barely stapled on to the flimsy particle board and it's very narrow for anyone who has a bigger body they may want to consider another option due to the fact its hard to stabilize because of its narrow pad surface. It was however shipped promptly and with all parts."""
4,Great product...Poor Packaging,"The GHD machine is an outstanding tool for flexibility & core strength. A good value for those wanting a mid-class machine. The package itself took 21 days to arrive and there were only scrap pieces of the cardboard box left and the white straps holding the equipment together. There are a couple square plastic cups that broke in shipping, but not a deal-breaker in it's ability to function. It's not difficult to put together at all and was done in about 20 minutes, we were missing several of the hex bolts & lock nuts from the package. Just be ready to get some extra hardware from your local Lowes. Still an excellent piece for any gym and mobile but still sturdy for use. I definitely recommend it."
4,Pretty good,"Aladdin is a pretty fun game, but it is meant more for littler kids. It is easy! It has good graphics and is really cute, but is more for ages 7-11."
4,good game,"I would recommend this game for anybody who has a Super Nintendo and likes Action/Adventure games. It has good graphics, sound, and it's alot of fun. The only thing i don't like about it is that it's somewhat easy. But it has enough replay value that I like going through the game over and over game. It would be a solid addition to any Super Nintendo library."
5,ALADDIN'S FIRST!,"I had this game for a long time.The music and graphics are still pretty good.This game is for every one.The one for Sega I think is more harder and this one is medium.The game gives you lives,bonuses,and cheats as you go along.You can throw apples and jump on the bad guys!With the help of Jenie,Abu the Monkey,the Flying Carpet,and the pretty Princess Jasmine beat Jafar in 1,2,3!"
3,All right...,"Nintendo made a slew of video games based off movies back in the 90's, and Aladdin was one of them. This game does not follow the movie to the letter, but gameplay is fairly smooth and entertaining. it's an average game, nothing too spectacular about it, but the graphics were pretty nice."
4,sm,I really like my watch. It's stylish for work and yet durable for yard work. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's difficult to read the digital display wearing sunglasses.
5,Very Good,I recieved this product just as it was listed. It is a great book. I would recommend any mother to be or father to be read it. Very haplful!
5,I love it!!!!!,"If you are looking for a new flavor, you gotta check them out!!! They bring a totally refreshing sound to the music scene...."
1,NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE,"I PURCHASED THIS GAME ON MARCH 7, 2007 FROM WAL-MART. I AM USING VISTA 32 BIT ON MY COMPUTER AND THIS GAME WILL NOT LOAD. I CALLED THE COMPANY PERSONALLY AND THEY TOLD ME IT IS NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE. ASKED THEM WHAT TO DO AND THEY SAID BASICALLY THAT I HAD SPENT $10 FOR NOTHING. ONCE THE GAME HAS BEEN OPENED YOU CAN'T TAKE IT BACK WHATEVER THE REASON. SO ALL OF YOU OUT THERE WITH VISTA BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN PURCHASING ANY NEW PC GAMES OR PROGRAMS IF YOU DO HAVE VISTA. MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND GO ON LINE WITH MICROSOFT TO CHECK THEIR COMPATIBILITY LIST."
1,Galaxy of Games 3001,"CD is not compatible with Windows Vista. Galaxy Games 3001 will play fro a few hours then stop working completely.There is no support for this pc game from the creator. It is listed as compatible with Vista, but the cd states only upto XP."
3,As well as it could be,"I have only played the card games, it ok so far for the price. I wish the graphics were better."
3,galaxy of games,"galaxy of games looks good but so many of the games are not thtat great, better to have purchased a few games and not tried to get everythng in one package"
5,Games 3001 for PC is very nice full of fun !,"I purches this PC Games 3001 for my sister because she was home from worke sick in know she would be home for about 3 weeks, so I gave her this game to cheer her up in It work CeCe love this game. Now CeCe is back to work in she said she can't get nothing done she can't put the games down. Since it made my sister happy it made me happy too ! The price is nice, shipping was fast so please give it a try ! THANK YOU ! have a nice day!"
4,The best upgrade cards for Mac,"XLR8 makes the best G3/G4 upgrade cards for the Mac, but don't buy them at Amazon -- the prices here are higher even than the manufacturer offers."
5,Our Soldiers are Second to None,"Second to None is an excellent book showcasing the integrity, the sacrifice, and the emotions of our soldiers as they served and defended the rights of the USA in the war in Korea. As one who only reads by getting 'into' the book, my heart was touched and my emotions stirred as I came to know the men who came home as survivors and those who did not. If you like/love history, if you know a soldier, if you are indifferent to our soldiers who are giving their lives for our freedom, you need to read this book."
5,A closer look,As a daughter of a Korea veteran I have to say this book is a must for every bookshelf. Gripping stories of the men who fought for our country and our freedom. It makes you want to get on your knees and thank God for these regular men who did extrordinary things for the sake of the American people. Thank you Barbara for putting this together so beautifully.
4,A Wonderful blast from the past,"A wonderful volume. I had read all the books many years ago, and had worn them out...So it is a great treat to re introduce myself to the witchworld. Personaly a "" must "" for any sci fi fantasy library . Good characters, an interesting world with great details, and best of all, the storys are just as good at over 50 as they were when I was a child."
4,A strange but good game...,"Spectre is perhaps the strangest SNES game ever. Like StarFox, it is polygon shape based and involves shooting down enemy tanks. The concept and gameplay is simple to grasp but tough to master. It is like the common tank shooter only with tank customization, ammo select, the ability to jump, level warps, and mines as well as flag rally in every level. This is a good game to grab if you can get it cheap..."
1,Beware ... Bad Manners,"I ordered this movie because I'm a dedicated fan of actor David Manners. Instead of receiving the Gotham Distribution version pictured here, I received the Alpha Video DVD release of ""The Moonstone"". This version of the film is *not* worth adding to your collection, at least as presented on this DVD. The original running time of ""The Moonstone"" was 62 minutes; here it runs only 47 minutes, meaning that one-fourth of the movie is missing! And the footage that remains is scratchy and jumpy, with grade Z contrast ... not even remotely worth watching for a glimpse of cult actor Manners.The Alpha Video DVD does contain a second feature, a creaky 1931 mystery named ""Murder at Midnight"". Unfortunately, it also is a bottom-of-the-barrel transfer of a film that wasn't any too interesting to begin with. Best to avoid this selection until a better, more complete version makes it to DVD."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR: MUTILATED VERSION!!,"The good news here is that the sound and image restorations are very good. The bad news, it was a worthless effort. This specific DVD comes in at 47 minutes, 15 minutes short of the film's actual 62 minute run time. Avoid this turkey like a cursed jewel."
5,Great undiscovered artist / cd,"It's too bad this collection was made in 2007. In 2012 internet radio is really hitting it's stride. When it's up to the people running radio stations to filter what you get to listen to, sometimes good music gets left out...just like this great audio disc."
5,Just what I always wanted!!,"You know, it's not easy finding rotisserie forks (prongs). I should have known better and looked for them on Amazon in the beginning!! Often we like to rotis a chicken and a nice pork roast at the same time. Impossible without two sets of forks to hold the meats. I am one happy customer - as always!!"
5,BBQ tools,"This was a confusing order. The item contains 2 prongs. I ordered 2 sets of the two prong item. I only received one set and had to call in the order problem. I email to shipper and was helped promptly. There was no problem receiving the balance of the order. It was handled nicely, with no questions asked."
5,Great Camera/Camcorder combiation !!,"Perhaps not as good as a dedicated Camera or a dedicated Camcorder, but as a combo device that adds very little weight to the AV300 series, it is an must-have option. Pictures are bright and clear. Video is clear sharp and very good frame rates (25 to 30 fps). Don't be misled by the negative reviews here. This is a great optional accessory for AV300 users. Not too mention that it comes with a vey nice travel case that fits the AV300 AND the AVCAM together. Nowadays it is kinda hard to find, but if you get a chance to get one, grab it. Alot of these were sold when they first came out and now very few are put up for sale, which should tell you alot about the quality of this unit."
5,"The title is kind of cheesy but the book is Simple,clear,full of useful information","I did not liked the title but I loved the book!Simple and ""full"" o information and clear examples.A good surprise!The Simple Secret to Better Painting"
5,Useful For All Types and Styles of Art,"The ""One Rule of Composition"" is actually three easy to remember and implement rules that will benefit any type or style of art. Pictures that accompany the text reinforce and demonstrate how the rules work."
3,Basic Information on Composition,"Like all kind's of book that proclaim to solve the problems with one ""secret"", this book is full of basic information about composition. It may be helfpul if you don't know anything about the subject, but if you are an serious art student I don't think that this is a great choice."
4,Well presented book,"It delivers on what is set out to do ...and explores the topic well.It shows and explains well. I only wish it had a resource guide to additional books and information that the artist could benefit from.For that I would say...find a good teacher and paint , paint, paint and just do the work."
5,Simple and effective.,"I had read reviews of people complaining about the title, or how the artist draw, but never judge a book by its cover. The theme of composition its really complex. It will take books for each topic, about contrast, gradation, patterns, repetition, armony, balance. Went to many seminars just to hear them talk for hours of just one topic.Composition its a thing that takes years to master, if painting were easier everyone will paint.Why i think this book its good?, its because it touches things they didnt explained in other books, and make things simplier, for me a book were you learn a couple of tricks its worth the buy.Any book that teaches something its a good book, and this book was an interesting reading, with lots of information.I recommend this book if you want to learn a couple of tricks to add it to your arsenal.The book its well written and not confusing."
1,I won't buy it again,"I read through this one and initially felt it was OK.I painted a landscape after reading this book and my painting was awful!If you really sift out the noise... there is very little content to this book.Then I downloaded Bob Rohm's Painterly Approach.... And I saw what a great book should be like!All the paintings in Bob's book are his own and they are fantastic!I did 2 paintings after reading Bob's book and loved them both!Greg Albert is simply not in Bob's class.Many of Greg's works have no ""atmosphere"" no ""poetry"".... so why did he bother?To be a great teacher you have to be a great painter first..!"
5,A book to enjoy,"Compared to Pablo Picasso by Ibi Lepscky, this book gives children a much better idea of the circumstances of Pablo Picasso's early life. This book makes for a wonderful first introduction to Picasso the artist."
5,Simply the Best!,Ms. Postolov obviously put a lot of thought and love into the making of this marvelous collection. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who can use a little extra 'push' from their higher self. A recording that can be listened to over and over and I still come away with a fresh outlook with each session. This CD just very well might have saved my life. Lucy Postolov is a force to be reckoned with...may be the Deepak Chopra of Oriental Medicine. The production value of this recording is unlike any meditation CD I have heard.
5,Too long neglected,"The Four Knights were a popular vocal group of the 40s and 50s somehow neglected by the companies who rushed to reissue work of much lesser groups.Smooth harmonies and the beautiful voice of lead tenor Gene Alford set them apart from other groups. They are at their best with simple guitar backing. On later recordings, including the hit ""I Get So Lonely,"" orchestra backing was, to me, intrusive. After Alford was forced to leave the group for heath reasons, the group never was the same. This album presents them at their best and the quality of the remix is outstanding."
1,What about ducts?,"This stuff sucks - it doesn't even work well on ducts! I mean, it may be just the thing for your punctured hose or for your nagging wife - but it isn't useful for its intended purpose!"
1,Shaq Fu,"This was the worst fighting game on the SNES system. Even worse than the home version of SNK's ART OF FIGHTING and FIGHTER'S HISTORY. The game is not only stupid, it's easy and the characters are really lame.Granted yes, this game was released when Shaquille was really, really big in the mainstream, but after this game, notice how things started to go bad for him. After all, he did KA-ZAAM. But anyway, the controls are bad, the graphics are bad, fights are really predictable (ex: you know what the computer is going to do) and all in all not a fun game.Seriously, SNES had all of the better fighting games so I'm sure you could find one that you like because there are several to choose from. For instance, STREET FIGHTER II series (New Challengers, Hyper, etc), MORTAL KOMBAT II and ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT, FATAL FURY 2 SPECIAL and even BALLZ. Skip SHAQ FU, it's a waste of your time."
1,Shaq Fooled,"He's a basketball player, yet Shaquille O'Neal made it so big with his basketball career that he thought that he could expose his name in the mid 90's.Shaq Dieselanyone? That was hilarious. Now look what Shaq came up with: a fighting game. Just by having the biggest name on the front of the cover tells enough what the quality of this game really comes out to.The video game consists of bad punchline dialog before the fights, a plot that's just predictable and stupid, lame graphics, and controls that are so agonizing to handle that it's just completely pointless.This game was voted one of the worst fighting games for a reason. No need to waste your time on this when there are far superior games released on the SNES with much better plots and controls."
1,A truly awful gaming experience!,"Legendary basketball player Shaquille O'Neil is in Tokyo as he goes into a Chinese store where an old man whisks you away into another dimension where you must combat enemies like a cat-lady, a mummy and other baddies.One of the worst games of all time! this game is a complete disaster that i remembered thinking the game has an odd yet wacky concept as it has to be fun and rented it from one of my local video stores. The music is ok and the graphics are cartoony but this game has lousy controls that feel like they have been busted, you keep getting killed without a fair chance.No wonder this has been a waste of rental money for those that rented it, in fact there is a site that is dedicated to destroying this horrible abomination of a game. It's as bad as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, X-Men for NES and E.T. for Atari."
1,I agree,"Shaq Fu was voted one of the top 5 worst SNES games two video game magazines beaten only by a barbie game. I played this game for a while and it is the worst! The play control is horrible, the characters are stupid, and the graphics are grainy. And the corny part is the story! I was laughing so hard when we heard the story: Shaq finds a Chinese antique shop and goes to another dimension to save a little boy, beats the crud out of a voodoo lady, a catwoman, and a living mummy and makes it back in time for the basketball game! How cheesy can you get! Buy it for laughs only!"
2,The Genesis Version is better,"I love Shaq Fu,and I don't care what anybody else thinks.It's just so bad,that it's good.Funny characters,terrible ridiculous story...it's great.This game has become something of a cult classic,but the SNES version is very watered down compared to the Genesis game.It is missing characters,backgrounds and a few other things as well.The storyline is pretty much the same,but since characters are missing,some of the storyboards will be missing too,through the story mode.Graphics and sound are a bit better than the Genesis version,since this IS on SNES,plus the controls are easier,although that wouldn't really matter,just as long as your using a six button controller on the Genesis.Overall,if you love a good laugh at something awful,enjoy the FULL experience and get Shaq Fu for Sega Genesis instead."
2,Impossibly Hard,"This is one of those SNES games that makes me wonder how hardcore gamers were back in the 90's. It's freakin impossible. The idea is hilarious, but Shaq has terrible moves, and everyone else has amazing moves, and super intelligent AI.Don't pay too much for this game, but it's good for a few laughs."
2,Reviewer For The Masses,"Roger Ebert is a movie critic. Gene Siskel was a film critic. Ebert is truely a movie reviewer for the masses. He does a good job pointing the common mind toward the all of the movies made for them to consume. After all, it was Roger who said that ""Three Kings"" was one of the best movies of 1999 (#3 to be exact). Need I say more? For the rest of us our only filter was Gene Siskel who was a far superior film critic to Ebert, and everyone else for that matter. If you are a movie fan then this book will help you with your movie rental search and keep you from wasting money on the real mind numbing garbage. However, if you like film, search elsewhere."
5,great train video for kids,My son is in love with trains. He loves this video. He has probably watched it 35-40 times in the last 2 months. It was even interesting enough for his big brother the first 10 or so times.
3,Trains,"I bought this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old son who loves trains. I wanted to get away from the Thomas and Friends to show him the real trains and the model trains. He enjoys watching this movie while playing with all his trains. However from an adult standpoint, its a bit dull. No fancy graphics or special effects. Its fine for the younger kids."
1,Amature DVD,"This DVD is soo bad! It looks like it was made by a 12 year old with a home camcorder. MMy son, who loves trains, and watches the shows constantly, will not watch this DVD for more than 10 minutes. Do your self a favor and buy a different DVD."
4,All about trains for kids,My son loves it except the part on the dog story. If the whole DVD is only about trains will be perfect
1,Beware!!!,"This booklet is included in Swissmar Raclette grill equipment. The list price printed on the book is $7.95. It is a tiny booklet, not worth buying separately."
1,Big rip off!,"What a rip off for a tiny book, which I could have picked up for free somewhere!Don't get fooled by this US$13.00 booklet, which would be worth $2.00 or less! Don't make the mistake I made!"
5,old but more pertinent than ever,"When my husband and I began to read this book, written so long ago we were stunned. I do believe that this information is more pertinent than ever."
2,Not As Helpful as the Title Suggests,"If you are interested to see what other companies are doing, who have no relevance to yours, this book is for you. If you are looking for practical guidance that you can use in your own situation, buy something else."
3,Vibrant!,"Very (I mean, extremely) vibrant illustrations and simple text depict a young girl's exploratory meanderings though a barnyard. Along the way she sees farm animals making sounds, and meets a friend. A map on the front and back covers charts her course. I was not particularly crazy about this book, but my toddler (bedazzled by the bright illustrations, perhaps?) absolutely adored it."
3,Seems like a solid piece of machinery,"But, it won't work for an NES or Genesis 1 like I was led to believe from the product ad. Label on the packaging inside says it is for newer systems. Might work for an SNES, though, but that wasn't what I needed it for."
5,Truly Illuminating,"Although lavishly illustrated, this title has more than just pretty pictures. Frank Lloyd Wright Glass offers a close up examination of some of Wright's greatest achievements, structural and decorative, discussing what they have meant to those who have followed. It looks through the window of architecture to see the broader cultural horizon, profiling specific sites to illustrate Wright's ideas and his legacy."
3,Held only minimal interest,"Like many cat toys, it always SOUNDS better in the description than it actually plays -- at least when it comes to my three fussy boys. This held the interest of Max the longest. And by ""longest,"" I would say about two days. Now it just sits on the floor, all alone and untouched (along with the catnip mouse, the crinkle sack, the jingle balls...) You get the picture. Next week, I'm packing it up and donating it to the poor kitties who have no toys to play with."
4,A thriller (not a police procedural) that could have taken a different turn,"A killer released after five years due a witness's revised story goes on a crime spree accompanied by his sister and his idolizing nephew. Encountering an author who the killer intends killing as a possible witness, he instead on a whim takes the writer with him, and Alex Kava could have taken a different turn here. Imagine what could have been done had the fictional author treated the real life experience as one of his stories and reacted as one of his characters might have reacted.That's not the route Alex Kava chose to take and so she's come up with a highly entertaining and incredibly fast moving summer type thriller. However, I kinda wish that she had allowed her character to have more of a writer's imagination and let us watch to see what might have developed."
2,Will Pass the Time but Nothing Memorable,"Kava has written a novel with a pretty evil main villain, Jared who was let off on a technicality from death row. He is accompanied by some limited intelligence followers being his sister Melanie and nephew Charlie who after a bungled bank robbery flee across the middle states of America. Successful author with a serious injury to his collar bone, Andrew Kane is taken hostage by the bumbling trio and Melanie soon realises nothing will stop the bloodthirsty rampage of her brother. Even worse he son seems to be following in his footsteps.Nothing spectacular happens in One False Move, what inside has been done quite regularly before and the ending is extremely predictable but if you get this book for a really cheap price in a second hand bookstore or for free from the library it will pass the time."
2,mundane,"Although it did feature two unexpected developments in the final pages, that does not overcome the predictable nature of most of the book. Unless the author was writting as a paradoy, she went too far in her foreshadowing. The ending was very sudden, and I think it lost a great deal of its possible impact by placing the only two surprises in such a short span of pages. This is not one of the better novels I have read recently."
4,One False Move,I liked it. It was the first time I have read this author. It was well written and kept my attention awaiting the climax. I will read this author again.
4,Very enjoyable,"Reading this book is a great way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon. While it was a quick read, it was still very intriguing and suspenseful and I never lost interest. The story came together quite nicely and I was pleased with the outcome (including a nice little twist at the end.) This is the kind of book you could read while waiting in line at the DMV. Definitely recommend this one."
3,"Tarja, a Finn in Spain","Having been an enthusiastic fan ever since I accidently got a hold of her first book I now have to say that I was somewhat disappointed on her latest book.The characters were ""ok"", but the entity certainly lacked certain elements of suspense and thrill. I really look forward hearing more of Maggie!"
4,A tense and wild ride...,"There is a difference between ""not guilty"" and ""innocent"". Crossing that fine line releases Jared Barret from prison, returning him to his sister's life, drawing Melanie and her son Charlie into a crime spree that results in murder. Now the three are on the run, guilty of murder, bank robbery, and hostage taking. Behind them, the police search for the truth, and nothing but fear lies ahead.**** Going in a new direction from her Maggie O'Dell stories, Alex Kava takes readers on a tense and wild ride. Fans of Grisham or Turrow will appreciate this new dimension to her writing. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews."
3,wrong description,"This looks to be a good quality replacement part, however the description makes it sound like it will work if you have ice and water in the door ""ice maker and water valve"" it only has one valve so it did not work for what I needed. It was cheap though so I was only out $10.00. The company I got it from said I could get a refund but it would cost $10.00 in shipping to return it, so I just kept it and put it in my parts bin in my garage, maybe my neighbor will need one someday."
4,Improve your catalogue,"A faithfull illustration is the only way I can select such a part. The illustration did not match the delivered product, but was suitable with some modification. It has been working well since installation. Product arrived on time. This is more of a complaint with the catalog process than the product itself."
2,Je K'a Ka Yoruba book review,This book is the second in the series by this author. This was not clear when I purchased this book. This would also not be evident by the title of the book for non-Yoruba speakers.My best friend is Nigerian and they were confused by this book. It seems to be for more advanced speakers and those who are interested in learning how to write or the details of the language. This book is not for beginners.
4,"nice cd, but what is with that cover art?","This is a nice cd for the price. If you want a solid (and inexpensive) introduction to Brahms' 1st, look no further. Haitink knows Brahms inside and out but he avoids making this symphony sound too familiar. The two overtures which seem to be standard additions to any Brahms cd are equally satisfactory. Recommended to anyone on a budget or anyone looking to start up their classical music collection.But why on earth does the cover of this cd look like an ad for my local community college?If you want to try more Brahms symphonies, check out the Harnoncourt or Mackerras."
2,They could have done this watch a good deal better.,"The features of the watch are great, dual time was just what I was looking for since I am an ""analog"" guy. I'm old school so I tell time quickly by glancing at the hands but I use my watch as an alarm clock so like it's digital features.The bad part is the chrystal must be made out of some form of transparent cheese or really cheap soft plastic cause it has scratches and pock marks in it from which it should have withstood. I mean it wasn't abused but the lens just can't take much and it's a shame cause it is a great watch.The hands on the watch are adjusted with a forward and a reverse button and unfortunately the reverse button quit working in about 6 months from new.You see it is a great watch except for these shortcomings. I love the subtle blue face and it's features but I wish they would have put a little more quality in it's components."
5,great watch,"I ordered this watch for my husband. he absolutely loves it. he wears it every day. at work, at home at the beach, at the gym, in the ocean, the shower, just simply all the time. I have the feeling that this watch will outlast any other watch. it s great."
3,"Works great, but with a few design flaws","I've been using the G300 for the past 1.5 years. it runs flawlessly. The only things I really don't like are:1. You have to set the digital time and analog time separately. Why can't they make it so that when I set my digital time, the analog hands sync up?2. There's a ""REVERSE"" button, but there's no reverse function according to their manual when you are setting the analog time. So if you overshoot your minutes, you'll have to forward the hands another 12 hours."
3,good watch,"the only problem i have with this watch is, when you want to use the light i have to press and hold the button. other than that true g shock value."
3,A FINE ALBUM But Didn't Meet My Expectation,"I purchased this recently after reacquainting myself with DM's work through a couple of studio works. I have never seen him perform live, and might feel differently if I had. I will see if this CD set grows on me over time, but my initial reaction to it is that it's just Okay."
3,Ok cup with a few small flaws.,"Overall this cup is alright and it seems to keep the coffee warm, but there are two issues I have with it. (1) The lid doesn't line up correctly. When you are holding the handle to take a drink, the opening is too far to the left. No matter how you screw the lid on, that's how it ends up. (2) It's top heavy. This cup has fallen over or almost fallen over several times because it's too top heavy."
4,Gets Me Through The Day,"Having a nice 8 hour T-TH schedule for classes, this allows me to tote around my coffee in the morning to get me much needed caffeine, and easily fits in my side mesh pocket for bottles once I am done with it so it doesn't become cumbersome to find a place to put it in an ever full backpack. Although as other reviews said it isn't a perfect 100% spill proof, that wasn't really what I was looking for, and this has now survived for over two years and is very well made (having it so long is probably more accountable to me not loosing the darned thing, as usually happens, so I am very glad that it hasn't shown any real wear after such long use). Much recommend for price and design, and if your not looking for a 100% spill proof, this MiGo travel mug is perfect!!!"
3,decent design with decent amount of flaw,"This coffee mug is design to fit well in cup holder in a car. However the narrow base makes very very easy to fall over. I've had occassion that I put it on the roof of my car as I picked up my stuff, a wind just knocked it right off the roof. The lid is not spill proof either, very inconvinient."
1,poor quality recording - only for the deep enthusiast,"When, where, and how was this made? With wax cylinders or possibly pressed directly into a 78 rpm, 80 years ago? Sounds awful!"
1,Huge Disappointment!,"Let's be clear: Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in the world, and my one-star review is in no way a comment on it. My criticism is of this particular recording -- and, in particular, of these MP3 files. Another reviewer noted poor sound quality, but the samples I listened to seemed fine to me. Only after I bought this album did I discover how defective the MP3 files are. All three of them cut off before the music is finished! This isn't a minor problem. With Part III, the Allegro scherzando -- the grand finale -- the recording cuts off a solid 20 seconds before the music finishes. It's such a huge disappointment. I ended up having to buy the Second Piano Concerto on iTunes (the Lang Lang recording with the Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre & Valery Gergiev). It cost twice as much, but it's a perfect recording. Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,RACHMANINOV PIANO CONCERTO # 2..FANTASTIC,I LOVE IT...THE MUSIC IS FANTASTIC..AND CLEAR...AND BEAUTIFUL A WONDERFUL CD TO BE DRIVING IN YOUR CAR AND LISTENING TOO.....I.THANK YOU...JOHN GODDARD
3,Not a 2003 recording,"While the performance of these two works is excellent, I was very disappointed that it was apparently a recording from 1972, not 2003 as noted in the disc information. The sound is definately not up to today's standards."
5,Russian Gold,"A dark, snowy night in St. Petersburg. A concert is being held in a magnificent venue. All of the Russian aristocracy, including the Tsar and the Tsaritsa, and the entire Imperial Court, are in attendance. The room is a study in glitter. The conductor raises his baton. The audience falls silent. And then, for a brief span of time, the world is a beautiful place...I'm no expert on classical music, but: this concerto, Andre' Previn, the London Symphony Orchestra - what more do you need?"
5,CD of Rachmaninoff Piano concerto #2 in C minor;rhapsody on a theme of Paganini,I received this CD in a few days and have put it in my CD player in my car. Listen to it daily and smile in sheer calmness as the melodies flow. This one is superb.
2,"I'm beginning to think ""Poses"" was a fluke.","Yet another disappointment with this album. Several times, I yawned and rolled my eyes in embarrassment at the overwrought production and stylistic bombast. What the hell? What happened to the sublime, beautiful simplicity that was found in spades throughout ""Poses""? I'm not asking for a duplicate of that wonderful record - but at what point will Rufus let up with the overly dramatic acts of vanity? If this is the direction he's going to carry on with then his time is up with me. There are moments - just barely - on this release that still hint at the amazing talent he has in him (thank ""Sanssouci"" for that, which I like). But I'm sick and tired of being hit over the head with the needless stuffing and hyper-orchestration he's unwilling to give a rest. Enough is enough. I'd love to hear some actual songs from him sometime again."
4,Surprising,"Starts off gloriously with ""do I disappoint you,"" then counters with contemporary concerns on ""going to a town."" So glad ""tiergarten"" sooths, before kicking it up ""between my legs."" And so it goes, this music inspires me to ponder other vocalists. Imagine Karen Carpenter singing ""not ready to love."" This music is fierce. What would k.d. lang do with it? This album's got legs, and struts a broad stage (since Hollywood is over)."
2,Disappointed,"After becoming a Rufus Wainwright fan from his last album ""Poses"" in which every track was wonderful, this album was a big disappointment. The songs on this album really lacked his depth and even his mellow voice seemed unsure of the songs he was singing. In short, it just seemed fake. I ended up giving this one away."
3,Release the Stars,"I like Rufus Wainwright. His ambition is something to admire, certainly, and his musical skills are imposing, to say the least. The orchestrations throughout this album are very well done, and I like how it sounds. But I can't say the same for the songs themselves. The muscles and the flesh are impressive, but the skeletons are beyond lacking.There is a brilliant four-song EP in here. Opener ""Do I Disappoint You?,"" follow up ""Going to a Town,"" mid-album ""rocker"" (It's Rufus, the song only rocks so much) ""Between My Legs,"" and the closing title track, are astounding pieces of work, worth hearing. But the rest of the songs are disappointing. They're all limp. The melodies are accomplished, but the way Rufus slurs through each and every one, and that they are all sung at that same, languid pace, keeps them from being involving. But those four songs are beyond belief."
5,Rufus sings to my soul.,"I am a middle aged man, 55, who was closeted for many years and now am out at bisexual. The pain and longing of having to hide away was almost too much to bear. Listening to Rufus just grabs my heart and soul and it is like he is reading me. He is young enough to be my son but he touches so many of my own feelings and experiences. I first knew Rufus for singing on the Brokeback Mountain sound track, specifically ""The Maker Makes"".Release the Stars is like a choral work that is all connected. I predict that Rufus will go down as one of the best."
4,Deliciously Fun,"I attended my first Rufus Wainwright concert in August and almost bought this album before the concert...and definitely bought it as soon as I got home. It's wonderful. If you're like me and see color when you listen to music, then this would be like watching and post-modern Fantasia--beautiful chaos. The songs are original and filled with so much emotion. Rufus is a gay Sonatra then brings something unique and bold to the table. Many songs are infused with messages not only about pain and frustration but about the problems with American politics. Nice work, Mr. Wainwright. You have yourself a new loyal fan. Keep up the great work!"
3,3-1/2 stars -- Up in the air,"Although I've known about Rufus Wainwright for a number of years, I never got around to listening to any of his albums. I got my hands on his latest album Release the Stars, and it's above-average, but...I'll just say that there are two songs that I can do without. One is ""Slideshow"", and the other is ""Between My Legs"" -- no, it's not about sex, but it's still quite bizarre (""I shed a tear between my legs?"" WTF?). Actually, another song that's a little questionable is ""Leaving for Paris No.2"" because although it flows well, Rufus sings the words in such a way that I had no idea what he was saying, and I had the lyrics right in front of me.Everything else is okay. Since I'm not as big a fan of Rufus as most of these other reviewers seem to be, I can't give five stars to Release the Stars. It should satisfy lovers of contemporary music, but there's really nothing here to run and tell a friend about. B.I.F.Anthony Rupert"
3,really a drag...and not the good kind,"This cd hit a really sour note with me. I've been a fan since the beginning of Rufus's career, and when I say fan I mean **FAN** I named my cat Rufus and only wished that I had a first born son to christen instead. But to be honest I don't think Rufus has had quite the same verve as he had in his first two cds, though even Want 1 and 2 are better than this one. Every song seems so lackluster and sloppy - like no effort had been put into it. It's just not the same rufus! I've listened to this cd over and over, hoping it would grow on me, but it only makes me more upset. He sounds like a bitter old queen - and a tedious one at that. Where's the frivolous, fabulous, flippant Rufus of yore? I'll stand by my man, but this cd was not worth the three year wait or the money spent. Hopefully the next time he makes us wait so long it won't be such a sloppy work."
2,Disappointing,"I love Rufus Wainwright - especially his earlier, sweeter music - but was profoundly disappointed by this album. ""Between My Legs"" was much, much better live when he was trying it out and the bootleg versions of the Cowboy Song (a bonus on iTunes) were also better than the less emotional version here. I think that Rufus still has it (""Do I Disappoint You"" is the proof)and could still receive the fame that he desires and deserves but it won't be because of this work."
4,Planet Wainwright,"The voice is one of the best in pop music. The arrangements can be over the top, but usually perfectly showcase the voice. The problem remains that the lyrics that voice delivers -- Rufus's life, loves, views on America, oblique Daddy issues and other plights -- are a whole lot less interesting than he thinks they are. His masterpiece will come -- and it WILL come -- when he belatedly realizes that the sun rises and sets each day on a whole lot more than just himself."
2,He has gone down hill since Poses,"I loved Poses but his music has gone down hill since. His last two CD's had a few good songs on them but this new one is completely horrible. I can't stand a single song on it. There is too much going on with this CD. It's become too complicated and I actually get a headache from listening to it. Hey Rufus, you don't have to try and top yourself with each album! As a result each album since Poses has become more and more over produced. Go back to simplicity."
5,There is a bit more ...,"Just to let you know that there is an instrumental version of ""Do I Disappoint You?"" at the very end of the British version that I really, really like."
5,You will be swept away!,"""Sails the Wind Left Behind"" will transport you to a poetic landscape of love, loss and lyricism. The collection has the three things I look for when reading poetry: flair, beauty and surprises. Ms. Lynch speaks to the tremblings of all our souls but leaves the reader with hope and inspiration."
3,"Great idea, but too small","I bought these in order to bathe our elderly dog without having to emmerse her completely in water--they worked great, and did help alot, but they are just too small--if they had been larger in size they would have been far easier to handle while using them on her."
3,"I LOVE THE BANSHEES, BUT....","Man, I was excited to see this DVD. The band is great, the filming is superb, and the performance is brilliant. However, even though it pains me to admit it, Siouxsie's voice almost makes this DVD unwatchable. I spent a great portion watching this DVD with a cringe on my face, as it was obvious that live, Siouxsie is completely tone deaf. I can't believe she could be that far off after singing for so long. This is definately for fans only, I would never show this to someone if I was trying to turn them on to the Banshees."
1,Is the title an amagram?,"Think about it.. This album is unlistenable. What a depressing thing to have to write, as a Banshees fan since Join Hands - and how the mighty have fallen (listen to ""Nocturne""). I can't understand anyone giving this more than a single star (maybe two if I was feeling generous... but I'm not). Way to trample all over your legacy guys. If your singer can't sing anymore, then my advice would be - do something else. Sorry, horrible."
2,Siouxsie sings off-key,"... Siouxsie's deep and off-key voice was not at all pleasant--it turned my stomach. It seemed to [take away] from the intensity of the rest of the performance (hence my 2 star pity rating). I was ecstatic when I first saw the track listing (some very old, obscure, but really great tunes). But I could barely watch! ""Monitor"" live I was hoping would be great. No. Couldn't Siouxsie have hired a voice coach or maybe have taken some steroids or something? I didn't (couldn't!) watch the whole DVD. I had to put in my ""nocturne"" videotape just to detox from this performance. Purist fan or not, this is not a DVD-worthy perfomance. (Budgie, of course, as always, totally rocks on them drums!) I don't know, I think I must be getting too old..."
3,THIS IS WHAT WE SETTLE FOR,"Rabid Banshees fans like myself have waited YEARS for a live DVD. The Nocturne set ( which featured The Cure's Robert Smith on guitar ) was released very briefly on VHS years ago ( 1983 I think ) and is something of a Holy Grail for frequent visitors to used record stores. I have that on CD and would KILL to have it on DVD. They should have released that instead of this . Although the band SOUNDS great, and looks great, as usual, Siouxsie's voice is just a MESS. To call her singing off key is a compliment."
4,interesting ideas!,"I liked this book quite a bit. It doesn't all apply to me, but I feel like I learned quite a bit from it. It gives great advice on how to share Christ in non-threatening ways with your neighbours.I don't necessarily agree with everything in here, but I would still recommend the book.The book is more targeted toward married couples/families, so if you are a married couple that desires to do more to reach the community around you, get this book!"
1,Don't be duped into buying this non-movie!,"While the product description gives you the impression that it is a historical documentary, the film or rather this slide show is nothing but a collection of old drawings which appear to have no direct connection with the topic, since no captions or commentaries justify their relevance. Besides not being a cheap dvd which you can put aside without much regret, this dvd is ridiculously short (21 mins.) & its inferior content/format does not qualify it as a true historical documentary. I've seen much better free slide shows compiled by amateurs in U-Tube & much better documentary dvds for a third of its price. While this slide show may be of interest to a few, in the least, this product was definitely misrepresented in its description."
5,really good book,"I really love the way Barbara Moore expresses things and has so much knowledge. I love the Tarot and always find such wisdom in her books. This book, I think, is great for any level of knowledge because her words are always inspiring and solid. Thanks Ms Moore."
5,Short and Concise-Good Book,This book got me animating after the first chapter. I like the way it's organized. It made it very simple to learn Flash. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has never used this program before. It's also not boring. Thumbs up
1,the game music is the only good thing,"The worst one-on-one fighting game I have ever seen or played. The only good thing about this game is the game music which was composed by the incomparable Brian May (of Queen). Other than that, it blows chunks."
2,boo,"Usually, I love the Magic books, but this cycle of books was one of the worst I read. The plot wasnt that bad initially in Onslaught, and even into Legions it still made sense, but Scourge completely ruined it. All of this just happened to result in a thousand something prophecy with ancient gods? The best things I really liked about this book, besides the end, and why I gave it 2 stars was it reintroduced other forgotten characters in the series and went back to a few familiar places, and it ended where Mirrodin began. Other than that just read it if you like Magic as a whole, not for this book specifically"
1,creepy (in a BAD way),"Nathan was a sniveling and pathetic character. His relationship with Nina was creepy and repulsive. My ""creepy"" has a negative connotation, as opposed to another reviewer's use of the word.Marcus' menage et trois, however, was hot. Maybe if a story or five were left out I would have enjoyed the book more. Lots of unfinished business."
5,"Complete, insightful and inspiring","Mr. Hadden is right on in his review. As a 76 year old Anglican and lifetime user of the 1928 BCP, the Commentary has been invaluable aid to understanding and more fully appreciating the meaning of everything along with historical context. I'm only sorry I did not own a copy when I was confirmed at 15.Although scholarly in approach, it is easy to read and understand. On the left side, a page from the Prayer Book is reproduced and on the facing page each prayer, psalm, exhortation, rubric, etc. on that page is examined and explained in ordinary English. Nothing is omitted except the Psalter. Even the title page, lectionary and tables are covered.It is tragic that the book is out of print and likely to remain so. It belongs in the hands of every practicing user of the 1928 BCP and certainly ought to be required reading in every Anglican or traditional Episcopalian confirmation class."
4,get this book and take off for an adventure.,definitely a must for a n.z. bound cycling adventure. this book keeps it all simple and clear without what you don't need. i cycled 4100km in n.z. by mixing and matching routes from the book and found it very useful. the only down side is the not very convenient format and the lack of good route maps which is not a big deal altogether. good luck.
3,Useful book for trip,"Useful book, although not essential. Basically biking in NZ is easy because there are only a few roads, once you get out of the cities. The book doesn't have enough detail in it to eliminate the need for maps.... I'd say that reading blogs and getting maps would be a better use of time than getting this book, but it is nice to have a few itineraries suggested."
1,To the 1st reviewer here ---,"Wot a stupid review. Doesn't even mentione the fact that it is all 4:3 aspect ratio, probably crappy VHS transfers HA HA HA... and in English dub!I mean, seriously, where is the technical information about this release?I rated it ""1"" because ""0"" isn't an option here."
1,can I make a return???,"I as well was really looking forward to receiving this book, when I did receive it, I was completly disapointed. I found the costumes to be horribly tacky and cheap looking, the craft area was way too small and rather useless. I am a serious Halloween goer, appreciating anything to do with the holiday, so maybe I could use the book to stand a pumpkin on..??????All in all don't waste the money"
2,car keys,"Defiantly not the quality I would expect from G E. The locking mechanism with the combination lock is very low quality. The stickers they provide to number the hooks do not stick to the surface, if you plan on using the numbering system be prepared to glue the numbers to the metal fixture."
5,key box,this key safe is very solid and secure. They keys hang on a metal hook that is well attached to the box insides. It looks nice and is made of heavy metal. there were extra key tags provided for future needs.
4,Great Value,"After years of keeping an increasing number of keys in my desk drawer, I finally purchased the GE TouchPoint Key Cabinet. It is a solid piece, not flimsy at all. It was easy to install and program the key code. Now everyone who needs to get to the keys can be given a code to open the cabinet. I only wish there was room inside for they key code list. I have to put it outside of the cabinet."
5,Black Tiger is the best,"I've had the Keurig machine for almost 2 years now and have tried a lot of the flavors and Black Tiger is still the best out of all of them. I like my coffee strong and flavorful and tried others with ""extra bold"" in their title and they are not as strong as Black Tiger. It is the one I re-order more than anything else and I thought it's about time I give credit where credit is due."
1,"nice and strong, but too much carbon","I do like dark roasted coffee -- but there's a thin line between dark roast and burnt to a crisp. Maybe it was just the box I got, because so many people seem to like it -- but I tried several times -- and never got past the carbon ash taste."
3,A good cup but problematic cups,Good strong coffee. The problem is with the kcups themselves. In my keurig these are the only cups I've ever had a problem with. After making my second cup of the morning there were coffee grinds in my coffee cup. Happened a couple of times. No other brand has done that...might have been a bad batch in my box. Nevertheless 3 stars for you.
5,Strong and smooth,"I love the Black Tiger from Coffee People. This is a very bold, strong flavor, and yet has none of the bitterness that usually comes with boldness. It's about perfect."
4,Strong,This is not my favorite coffee but I'm still giving it 4-stars. To me it taste a lot like the Starbucks coffee that hotels and conferences put in those giant coffee pots for the public.
5,Good Dark Roast,"If you like a Dark Roast and lean to the bold cups then you should give this one a try. I have several I like, and will buy again, and this is one of them."
4,A little bitter,Not bad but a little too bitter for our taste. Enjoy Coffee People extra Bold better.
3,Taste?,"I really enjoy Donut Shop Coffee from this same brand, but I thought I'd see what their darker, bolder roasts had to offer. After tasting this I don't understand the appeal. I was looking for rich bold taste and found bland generic coffee. Worst yet you can't buy it in stores so it isn't even convienient to purchase, and I bought so much of it I was stuck drinking it for quite some time."
5,Awesome!,I consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur and I think this coffee is awesome! I have compared it to other K-cups and this is by far the best I've had.
1,Bitter,I ordered this coffee for my Keurig brewer and I was very disappointed with the flavor. It was very bitter and acrid. I like strong coffee--but this was just unpleasant to drink. I ordered 2 cases and we managed to finish off one of them... I'm giving the second one away as I can't bear to drink another sip of it. It tastes like burned rubber. Blech! I can not recommend this product.
3,COFFEE TASTE,A little less than I expected. It tends to have a muddy taste - not what I expected since they said it was the favorite of the company.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,This is the absolute worst coffee I've ever tasted! I love strong coffee and this was awful. One reviewer said it tasted like burnt rubber...YES..that's it! I'd also say it tastes like rotten sour garbage. (Not that I've ever tasted that!) But the way old garbage smells in a dump or that's been sitting in a garbage can outside in the hot sun for several days...that's what this tastes like. Don't waste your money on this!
2,"Great coffee, way too expensive here.",This is one of my favorite k-cup coffees. Bold and assertive but smooth and without bitterness. Unfortunately it's out of stock at Keurig.com where a 24 count box sells for $13.90(for members)and includes free shipping. I considered ordering a box here until discovering the unreasonable price plus shipping of this item from this seller. Buyer beware!
1,"not exactly green, is it?","I have only seen one Keurig brewer here in Japan. Don't those little plastic packages generate an awful lot of non-degradable waste? Do we really need more, especially for the sake of saving a few seconds making morning coffee???"
5,Nice strong cup 'o joe,My wife loves STRONG coffee. this is the only K-cup that did the trick for her. Makes a good bold cup of coffee.
1,Didn't like it,Didn't like it... I like strong coffee... but this tastes smokey. Just didn't like it.... Don't mind the Green Mountain Bold Magic... but this... just can't choke it down. Sorry.
4,No Lie!,"When the labled this product ""extra bold"" they were not lying! So far, it's the only coffee I've used in my Keurig where I changed the size of the cup so that I had more water.Perfect for Monday morning's or travel mugs! Daily coffee I prefer something not quite so strong. My housemate added hot water."
4,"good, strong coffee","We like bold coffee and we liked this just fine. Nice dark, bold coffee....still need 6 words to complete the review."
3,"Black Tiger K cups, decent dark roast","Purchased to supplement regular subscribe & save shipment, which would be coming too late to replenish my supply due to heavier use over the holidays. This is good but I prefer Emeril's Big Easy Bold."
4,Nice strong taste but .....,It has a nice strong flavor but I get a few grinds in my cup which is a first for all the k-cups I have tried. I ordered Timothy's Midnight Magic along with this which I like better and would order again. I probably wouldn't order this one again due to the grinds.*** update: 3/6/08 - I have had grind problems in other brands as well so I wanted to edit this review to state that I would order this one again.
3,Okay coffee,I have this coffee. It is not the best coffee I ever had. It not as strong as other coffees. I would prefer French roast.It does not give you much energy.THE END
5,love this coffee...,was not sure I would be keeping my machine since I really love a dark roasted cup of coffee. This one fits the bill and now I love my machine AND the coffee it makes.
2,poor packaging,"I received a 25-count box of Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast that had 3 packets with unsealed tops. In fairness, I don't know if this was the result of poor quality control in production or damage during shipping. My order included a box of Gloria Jeans K-cups which did not have opened tops so I suspect that the tops on the Coffee Peoples cups were not glued properly.One day after voicing my concern, I received a replacement. What great service - I'd give them 5 stars now!"
1,yick-- too bitter!,"I originally tried the variety pack that came with my Keurig and it had the Bold Organic from coffee people which was excellent-- I went online to buy some and saw all the great reviews for Black Tiger which steered me to buy it instead of the Organic. Boy, what mistake-- it was VERY bitter and I was stuck with two boxes of it! If you like your coffee with a bite then go for it. This is bitter even at the mug setting. If you like your coffee smooth avoid this like the plague! After two months of trying to use this up, I'm finally finished with it. I was the only one in my family that would go near it-- it was like swallowing a bitter pill every day. Never again! I thought I should warn those out there from being swayed by bitter-coffee lovers.David"
1,K-cups are defective,"I have owned a Keurig brewer for over 2 years and have never had a problem with any K-cups. I had previously purchased these K-cups as part of the Subscrible and Save program and had been happy. The last order I received has been a disaster, either the filter piece is missing from the K-cup or the K-cup is not sealed properly. Amazon customer service was excellent as usual and replaced the order, but I am having the same problem with the replacement cups. I know it is not my brewer because I have other K-cups that work just fine. It is very messy when the coffee grounds either explode all over the place or end up in the cup. It is extremely aggravating to go through 10+ K-cups to get one cup of coffee. Again, this is not the fault of Amazon, but rather the manufacturer of these K-cups. I will be canceling this Subscribe and Save plan."
5,My favorite K-cup coffee,"I love this coffee. If you like a bold and flavorful blend this coffee is perfect. If you've found the k-cups you've tried are too weak try this one. The coffee is bold, not burnt, with a complex flavor. We get this coffee on automatic delivery. We never want to run out."
2,Doesn't smell like coffee,"This coffee doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't smell like coffee. If I put non dairy creamer in, it has a bad smell that stops me from drinking it at all. Still looking for a good strong coffee that I can enjoy."
5,Bold Like the Package Says,"Had not bought this coffee before but have the kcup unit for it and wanted to try something new. It's been the first choice of coffees in the office and we're just about due to order more. For my taste, this coffee is perfect, dark yet not too strong."
4,A good strong cup...,"If you are a ""strong coffee"" drinker, this is one of the better roastsavailable in K-cups. Coffee-People's ""Jet Fuel"" is another good choice."
3,"Not bad, but we like Timothy's Midnight Magic and Green Mtn Dark Magic better!","Not bad, but we like Timothy's Midnight Magic and Green Mtn Dark Magic better! Please read my review under Timothy's Midnight Magic for in-depth comparison. Overall, not a bad cup, bitter smell, not as bold as the others listed above. In fact, I prefer the Diedrichs French Roast over it as well.#1 Timothy's Midnight Magic (see review)#2 Green Mtn Dark Magic (Target)#3 Diedrichs French RoastA lot of people seem to really love the Black Tiger based on the reviews, I have them sitting on the counter, but once my friends try the Midnight Magic from Timothy's, they never try anything else. Just my limited experience. :)"
4,Bold but strong aftertaste,"This is a decent coffee that is bold tasting up front, which I like, but then has a harsh aftertaste. It is cheaper than the others, I didn't mind it, but it was not my favorite."
5,Solid Dark Roast offering from Coffee People,"Coffee People Extra Bold Kcups are some of my vary favorites for using in my Keurig Brewer.I'm a Huge fan of strong , Bold dark roasted Coffee and Black Tiger delivers."
3,1 of 5 Kups Breaks,"Great rich flavor. Long time user but a 25%breakage rate-never had cups do this before.I noticed the cups seem to be more ""puffy""with air, perhaps this is the problem."
4,disappointing,"You may be wondering what is disappointing about a four star coffee.... This is a better than average brew, reasonably strong while not bitter (so no robusto beans), but the flavour, if ""intense,"" it is not particularly rich. If you love Timothy's Rainforest Espresso & Parisian Nights, this coffee is not in the same league. It is similar to Green Mountain's bold roasts."
2,Not the best cup I've ever had,"I'm sorry but my family and I did not enjoy this coffee at all. The box that it was shipped in was covered in coffee grounds for one thing. And to be honest, it really has no flavor to me. My husband and son literally love a strong cup of coffee and they did not like it. I read the reviews before I ordered this because I wanted to try something different. Some said it was very smooth, that's because it has no flavor. I will stick to Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso; there is no comparison as far as flavor."
3,Received Tree Hugger,"It's hard to say how the eye of the tiger would've tasted, because I received a box of tree huggers. Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience."
2,Black Tiger Dark Roast,"I thought it tasted funny, so I don't drink it. However, my husband likes it. And I'm the one who loves strong coffee!!"
5,I wake up thinking about this coffee!!,"I have been using a Keurig for a few months now and have tried lots of different K-Cups. The Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast Coffee is my favorite! It has a wonderful aroma and a deep, rich flavor and color. I definitely need a little push in the morning and this does the trick, just the smell of it in my cup helps to get my day off to a great start!"
2,Always compare prices,"This is a great product and often not always available in stores. Good to be able to purchase in bulk. I purchased this same carton of 12 Sweet and Low bulk boxes in March of 2011 and the price was $23.72. Now the price is over $64 for the same item, plus over $10 shipping!! Bottom line--as with any retail transaction, you need to determine whether or not the price is reasonable in relation to other sources of the same product."
5,Sweet 'n Low,My husband I like the product. We are now using our second 8 oz box. I have now ordered the second box of 12 8 oz boxes. We do not use any other no cal sweetner and we like the loose sweetner instead of having to open many packets a day. It is more economical and we do not have all that paper waste. Amazon is the place to buy this product. We also have a kendal reader from Amazon as well as many books.
2,Wow! These opinions are amazing about the game!,"I wouldn't dare insult people's opinions, but this game is my least favorite of the Super Star Wars Trilogy! Go and rent it at a store to see if you agree with me or not because this is the kind of game I think you need to know about in advance! Like all the Super Star Wars, it is hard to beat but is boring to me! I feel it in the force, it is not a good game! I love the classics, but they made it almost impossible to beat, even for a Brave, like me! ..."
5,The best And Still going...,"The Empire Stikes Back is a sweet game. In this game you get to play Princess liea, wich is cool. and you get to face darth vader for the first time. This is a sweet game. any Star Wars fans should own it.If you liked this game check out all of the star wars games"
3,The Kobayashi Report,I used to play this game quite often when I was a kid. But I was never really good at it. Though I used to like it I don't really care for it anymore.
2,Ugh,"It says somethign when even I don't like a book. I can take an abusive hero as long as in the end he apologizes or somehow atones. This guy was completely undeserving of the heroines love. He was cruel and indecisive and he doesn't know the meaning of the word ""fidelity."" Actually, even his father who is supposedly madly in love with his wife isn't faithful to her."
2,This Book is Awful,"Before this book, I had read about 10 Susan Johnson books and found them all well written and enjoyable. After I read this book, it took me about 2 years before I even picked up another S.J. book. The hero (and I use this term loosely) was sexy in the beginning, but after he's cheated on the heroine about 5 or 6 times he just becomes gross. I don't care how good looking a man is or how good he is in bed, a self-absorbed (...) is just not sexy. I do admit that Nikki is a realistic character, given the period and the fact that he is rich and spoiled, but he is not the type of man that I would base a romance book around. I just found him to be icky. The sex scenes were good though, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. S.J. has a lot of very good books with good sex scenes, so I'd skip this one and read another."
3,"Not a bad boy, but a spoiled brat","I realize that this was written back in 1979 and romance novels were a bit different back then. I am usually a fan of the older romances, I find them different and refreshing compared to the historical heroes that are invented in modern romantic fiction. I love how the heroes were written back then and I have no aversion to Nikki being a cheater, jerk, etc. That being said, I found him a spoiled brat and boring. I personally prefer the dark, dissolute heroes.I agree with other reviewers in that SJ wrote Nikki to be exactly what he is and that she wrote it well. It had some very memorable scenes but I will not be reading it again."
3,Don't Update the Classics,"I have the one of the original Moody Press Classic prints of this body of work and this modern day ""updated"" reissue. The original work done by Nicholson used only the KJV for his scripture references. I see this happening more and more as Satan gets the present day world to change not only The Father's Holy Word, but to water down classic works based on the only english translation without error, the King James Version! Why can't the classics that are KJV based be left alone and just reprinted!"
1,not available,"I think it really stinks to advertise your product then say, ""item is not stocked or has been discontinued. Please make another selection."" Well I would have if this wasn't the one listed."
3,It's not the greatest...but!,"I purchaced a Toshiba 3000 unit six months ago. It was connected to my Sony 53HS10 HDTV. It is connected to both a channel master roof antenna and a Directv HD Dish. The unit tended to flash the TV picture when network signals burst. I returned the unit for a second and the same problem occurred. I only get the flashing on the 1080i mode. After a Sony service call and replacement of the outdoor antenna and a readjustment of the Directv dish the problem continued. The picture 98% of the time is great. After $89 monster cable and no improvement, I will live with the occassional flashing thinking that perhaps the problem is really the experimentation of the networks. My feeling is that the Toshiba and the Sony are not 100% compatable. Potential buyers please be aware!"
2,not happy,"after about 6 months my toshiba dst-300 lost the video input ,I could hear the sound but the screen was black. technical support was not much help either. I had to spend an extra $150.00 to have it fixed.my old hughes receivers are 5 years old and I never had any problems with them."
3,Great HD signal......so-so STD signal,"Love the sat and local integration menu. The HD signal if fantastic! However, I have to say that the standard digital signal was not as clear as my RCA Ultimate TV receiver. Therefore, I found myself only using the receiver when I want to watch HD, which is about 10% of the time. Also, after having the receiver for more than a year, my video signal went out. I am currently having it serviced outside the warranty period. So consider getting the extended warranty."
1,"Nice, until it died a week later.",Very nice HD picture quality. Very soft and fuzzy picture quality on all non-HD channels. I returned it when it died a week later.
3,Let's read about Avril,"If you like reading, and if you like Avril, this book is absolutely for you. It has the biography of this skater girl for Napannee, Canada, plus some interesting facts about her. If you want to know about Avril's life, you must have this book."
3,cd1835,"I grow up watch this show,and this is the popular episode.part1 tells it all and therw out the jeannie series, it became barbra edens' tradmark. Althouth it was not a ground breaking series like ( all in the family) but it had it's monent's.Larry hagman hold up the series. If is was not for him,the show will not make it and he will not be the future j.r. ewing of dallas fame. When barara eden is temopar out of the story, larry action move's make the show to watch.part three throw of the plot of the series,part four brings it back.for fans and folks want to know about the series, this is the tape to watch."
3,Not as tightly bound as I would like,"Katie Long hates small town life and is planning to get out. She's fantasizing about Joe Carson, the new security guard at the Casino and the catches his eye by masturbating for him while he watches on the camera...Erotica is the first person is always difficult but Bound started out well enough, I read the first 30 pages in the book shop. Katie is a fine narrator, Joe not as clearly developed but we are seeing him through her eyes and hampered by her ignorance. The relationship progresses nicely, with sex and nuance. But then the entire book - plot and characterisations - fell down in the last third, which felt incredibly rushed. Huge issues were introduced and then swept away and the ending came way too quickly. I would read this author again, but hope she gets a better edit next time."
2,Eh. Nothing special,"When I bought this book, I was hoping to get a great story that focused on engaging characters with a believable view of BDSM. I'm sorry to say that it was hard to stay with the book, because the characters weren't someone I could care about. I don't recommend this book for anyone who wants a good story with their erotica."
5,Great read,I have owned this book for a really long time and it is one of my favorite bdsm novels. Its not like those sick ones out there. If you like a decent bdsm novel this one is for you.
3,Sarny,"Sarny is about a black women during Civil War and she was freed by some soldiers fighting for freedom.'' It was like BOOM! POW! BASH! CRASH! KAPOW! BLAMO!!!!! Oh Yeah. They won isn't that great? Her children were taken and she went to find them. She helped soldiers who were dying, and she finds her children. This is a historical fiction book and it is by Gary Paulsen."
4,Sarny,We really enjoyed this book. It was very emotional in some parts and very funny. It gives people the chance to see what it was like to be a slave and to change dramatically in one day. We give this book 4 stars out of 5.
4,What a great book,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly, I thought it was well written, and once you started reading it, you were shipped back in time. I thought it was a good book, and should be read more in High School classes. I believe I learned more about slavery than I had known before."
3,mark's review,"This is a good book. The time and setting are very interesting and the story is very easy to follow. It has also given me insight on parts of slavery iv'e never known. For instance that they secretly taught each other how to read and write. Another cool thing is that it shows the time period through the eyes of a slave going all over the south from Georgia to Louisianna. This book however isn't one of my favorites, but it is a good read. I would recommend it to History classes teaching about the slavery era. This book ;however, isn't on one of my favorite topics and its kind of so-so... So I'll give it a rating of 3 stars"
5,Great Book!,"This is a book written by Gary Paulsen. He's an interesting author. This book is about slavery,and how a man named NightJohn helped a little girl named Sarny teaching her how to read and write. NightJohn had two kids Delie and Tyler they were in New Orleans. He also tied to get to the North for freedom. After the slaves get a chance to leave from Waller (which is a white man who controlled the slaves) he drinks whisky. So NightJohn moved to the North and started searching for his kids. After all the trouble he went through with passing soliders by the border.His daughter Delie became a business type of person,his son Tyler became a doctor for 30 years,but also died happily.I like this book because for many of slaves many didn't know how to read or write.This showed that NightJohn was a very brave and smart person. This book also shows me the steps through the hard work they were put in to do during this hard period of time."
5,I:Cube - Picnic Attack,"PICNIC ATTACK is like a breath of fresh air in the sometimes stagnant face of house, and even though it was released in 1997, it still sounds new and urgent today. There are the obvious crowd-pleasers like ""Disco Cubizm"" and ""Picnic Attack"" that do disco house the right way. But I:Cube's careful merging of tech elements and a solid house beat can't be matched. ""Mingus in My Pocket"" and ""Strange Wax"" have darker elements to them, while ""Mighty Atom-Sub Aqua"" has squelchy electro hints to it. ""Yes Mama"" is simultaneously deep and twisty. My favorite tracks, ""11 Novembre"" and ""Comme Des Esprits"" have a surreal quality that leans towards a moodier place. Absolutely wonderful album all the way through."
1,broke easy,All 3 of these tips broke soon after I bought them I thought because they were expensive they would be super strong.They are OK on screws that are not stuck but on old rusted screws the screws won and these went in the garbage.I don't know why they are so expensive because the quality is not very high.
5,Mississippi: The Screwed & Chopped Album is the best chopped and screwed album I have heard!,"David Banner's 2003 debut studio album, Mississippi: The Screwed & Chopped Album with the help from DJ Michael ""5000"" Watts for Swishahouse to chopped up all 19 tracks on the album includes hits like: Like a Pimp feat. Lil' Flip and Cadalliac on 22's."
5,Tha South Iz Here,"thiz waz such a tight cd nuthin iz tighter than chopped n screwed banner tears up every song and with help from Lil' Flip, Lil' Jon, & Pastor Troy on some songs this is one of the best albums i've heard i suggest anyone who loves Dirty South music like i do, this album iz a must have"
3,THA SCREWED N CHOPPED OV DAVID BANNER,"I DONT KNOW Y THEY CHOPPED UP THA CD, IT WUZ ALREADY TIGHT. I LUV SCREWED, BUT U WILL GET BORED OV THA SONGS SO QUICK CUZ ITS SO SLOW, SOMETIMES U JUST WANNA FEEL A FAST HYPE SONG 2 GET U CRUNK. SO U PEPO OUT THUR CAN GO A HEAD AND BUY IT ON YA OWN WILL, BUT EARNS A 3 STAR FOR THE REASON DAT EVERY SONG IS SCREWED AND LATER GETS ANOYING."
5,"Guide Gear Non-insulated Deerskin Gloves, BLACK, M","The product is better than described.They are made from a thicker deer skin than those from Marks work warehouse, also about half the price as well. A good deal."
4,Good Quality,These are good gloves. I use these for motorcycle riding with a pair of padded neoprene cold weather bicycling gloves from REI underneath. The gloves are showing a little bit of wear after a few years of use including quite a few rides in the rain - but well worth the money.
4,Most famous guy I never heard of,"The subject of the book was amazing. Humboldt traveled and studied everything: geology, botany, sociology, geography, anthropology, archaeology, and astronomy. He created a new science, plant geology. He traveled all over South America and Central America. He was well loved everywhere he went. The book was a spellbinding read.The only minor downside of the book is it does drag in the middle. Humboldt travels to many places and the author almost does a day-by-day journal. The amount of detail and the hundreds of locations just gets boring, but I stress, on the whole, the book relates a fascinating story about the most fascinating forgotten man in history. Putting the book down is hard.To understand modern science, this book is a must read. This one man influences the development of almost every branch of science and contributes to the abolishment of slavery in several different countries. The book provides a glimpse into history that I thoroughly enjoyed."
2,Humboldt was much more interesting than this book is,"Humboldt was a universal scientific genius who was also a genuine explorer into the wild. He had a mercurial personality and progressive political views. He was, in short, one of the most interesting people who have ever lived. Unfortunately, Helferich writes like a committee. His prose is clear in the way a company's annual report is clear. As a study of Humboldt's South American journey, the book is 100% derivative but it provides some basic information and has the advantage of being readily accessible. Basically the book is a retelling of Humboldt's own narrative, with too-few asides providing modern information on topics to which Humboldt turned his curiosity."
5,First game I can remember playing...,"Still fifteen years later, the only game I can come back to and say that it may be my favorite game of all time. For the C64 this game had really nice graphics(which are completely outdated now) and great sound effect and soundtrack. Everything about this is suberb and nothing is shoddy. Just a tight well crafted game. Story may be a little cliched now, but it was executed very well. I cant recommend enough."
2,"not zelazny's best, ok delany","the zelazny half seemed pretty flat to me, a zelazny fan; like he just did it to finish a contractual obligation or something. the delany half was pretty good straight old style sf; i don't know enough delany to say how it compares with his usual work."
4,To the point,"Cory plays with images and puts it all on the table for everyone to see. In American Girl, Cory touches on almost all subjects dealing with being a female. She takes us through heartbreak, love, and even through gun rights. I believe that Cory put her heart into this book and the readers will see. A must read."
5,ana vingare fado,"excellent overall ,music selections carefully chosen,superb musicians.ana superb.recommend highly."
4,Ear candy for the thoughtful person.,Pharaoh of Mars is truly a concept album that takes you on a journey from beginning to end. This is one of those albums that is complete and stands by itself. All it needed was for me to own it...
3,"Very Nice, BUT . . .","Does NOT handle playlists; plays mp3s only in the order the files are stored on disk (standard computer file ordering). This is a major drawback for me, but I'm hoping for firmware upgrade to address this problem."
3,MP3?,I like the product. I don't remember reading that it will or will not record. I'm just not sure what the MP3 is. Sometimes I tend to use something and not actually know what the name of it is. So that is possible. But it is also probable that I've never seen it.
2,Only if you absolutely need MP3 playback,"If you really need an *MP3* boombox, this seems to be the best of the bunch: it plays MP3s well. The sound quality, though, is very poor compared to comparably-priced boomboxes (with regular CDs): annoyingly bright, hard, and distorted highs that make it unpleasant to listen to for long. The AM and FM reception is poor. There's no tone controls, no anti-skip protection, no way to power it in a car, and no audio out or headphone jacks for other speakers or dubbing.In short, you're trading off features and sound quality for MP3 playback. Without MP3 playback, this is a very attractive ... boombox.I bought this to provide background music for my massage therapy practice. On synthesized music without vocals, the sound is tolerable, and the ability to put 10 hours of music is very nice indeed. But I regret buying it."
2,Cheaply made file cabinet,"This thing doesn't live up to what I expected from Hon. Light weight, cheap, wobbles. Came without drawer dividers. I got some very cheap ones a few years back from Walmart but this time I decided to pay more and get better quality. This one was better but not a whole lot more. Cost more but wasn't as good as one I got at a local retailer a few months ago. Glad I only ordered one."
4,Very nice.,I did have a small dent in both cabinets when I received them. But the added bonus was I didn't need the racks to hold the hanging files.
1,Quality pays you back.,"I should of spent just a bit more money and bought the next cheapest carafe. This carafe is stylish and cool loking, however; it leaks out the bottom. Something that is brand new should not do that. I would not recommend this item. In short, quality pays you back."
4,Down Twisted,"This may not be the best movie in the world, but well worth a look at. A good little movie as long as you are not expecting an A+ Hollywood style movie, but a good B-Movie. Check it out..."
2,Pyun is his usual crappy self,"May be of interest for fans of Carey Lowell (who I wish I hadn't learned was married to Richard Gere), or for ""fans"" of bad-movie maestro Albert Pyun. A somewhat fun little romp with plenty of stupid."
2,cc movie,"if you want a courteney cox movie, dont buy this! shes in it for like 2 minutes!good to see her but stll not enough"
3,For diehard fans only,"To be honest, even though I loved the series and had alot of fun with this game, it's not much unless you really liked the mini-subs from the series. It's a good game, but I had been hoping for interaction with what made the series great, the characters.Still, fun, and if you want a challenge, go right for it. It's an difficult challenge, but if you can get past the second mission, it gets easier. Even my mom liked the game."
3,Great concept - badly executed,"I have been a fan of the series for years.I bought this game when it initially came out. Although I was enthralled, the novelty soon wore off. The game's difficulty spikes quite hard at the second level. As if nobody ever bothered to ask the QA people to make external beta testing.For the fans, go right ahead. It's a must play for you guys.For the others, you might want to skip this title and invest in a better game. Because, frankly, the interest fades quite quickly as you try and try to make that one mission, but you keep missing it; it gets frustrating really fast."
5,Fun!,"Great sound. MP3's play great. I have this at work and now I have something to look forward to when I come in. Philips website shows that it has a three band equalizer, but it only has bass & treble controls. Everything else about it is great!"
4,Super fast shutter speed! Average Image quility,"It can even capture my dog when she is running! I had a Sanyo MZ3 2.0mega pixel but seriously I couldnt see any difference on indoor pictures. Under flash/auto condition, both camera produce similar pictures. However, the sanyo makes a better focus in micromode and when flash is disabled.Z110's outdoor image is great. I use the best mode to take a lot of great sunset picture. This camrea is heavier than I expected but I really like heavy camrea since its more stable when you take snapshot.By the way, the CCD of this camrea is produced by Casio itself and its size is only 1/2.5 inch, while Casio EXZ110 is produced by sony and the size is 1/1.8 inch. So I expect Z120 will make a better image.I bought it online for $169. It doesn't fair to expect too much. I can say this is the best camrea under $170."
4,"Hooked on Left Behind, but there is better...much better","Okay, I'm hooked on this series. I've read 6 of the 9 so far and I have to admit it gets pretty unrealistic at times. I guess I'm just a sucker for a soap opera. I'm hooked on the story of the characters.On the other hand, while I'll keep reading Left Behind, I have to agree with all those that say that The Christ Clone Trilogy by James BeauSeigneur is really a better and much more realistic end times series. Besides since The Christ Clone Trilogy is a completed series, you don't have to worry so much that the rapture will come before you finish reading.;-)"
5,GREAT BOOK,"I bought this set for my wife, she says that it's a great set that really opens your eyes. She recomends everyone read it."
4,Ambiguous,"My wife loves this series of books, I however would prefer to undergo bowel surgery performed with kithen utensils and a one eyed rabid dog called satan. (it has four stars as this was only bought for my wife as thus only reflects her opinion)"
5,Inspiring.,"I was inspired by reading these books. Never has a series of books captured my attention as these. I am a Christian but even if I was not, this series would definitely make me think about my life, and which direction I was going. They bring to life the Bibles Prophecies in a way that anyone can understand them. These books will always remain at the top of my prefered reading list."
5,Left Behind Review,"Can't put these books down, it really holds my interest and it is an easy read. Now I am looking for 7 and beyond of these books."
5,Excelent Product,"Office Ultimate is an excellent product with all the tools needed to get the job done. However I would warn you about purchasing it from Nothingbutsoftware.com. I found out the upgrade version would not upgrade from the software I had on my machine, it was no fault of Office Ultimate. I returned the software to nothingbutsoftwar.com and they charged me $51.30 restocking charge. I paid $342 for the product and I think $51.30 is a ridiculous charge for restocking. I returned the product unopened and in perfect condition."
4,Disturbing,I bought this movie in spite of bad reviews from critics; reason - I am interested in the work of Steve Railsback. This is one of his earliest movies; the theme is one of revenge basically but there is a sub-plot which is not spelled out and is deeply psychological. It deals with the inherent violence of the human race and the battle to conquer these tendencies. Steve Railsback's performance as the vengeful soldier is chilling but at the same time he manages to portray some vulnerability in the character. I did not find it repulsive but it's not for the faint hearted.
1,This was a fad!!!,"This was a fad, where they were hoping to be the next Tetris and they came out on every system and every platform, people were hooked on matching colors of triangles with squares, then the people playing this game got bored of it and it was never heard from again. The point is that you must select a triangle from the middle of the screen and point it toward an isle of squares and shoot it off to destroy the squares. If too many squares get lined up, you lose!!!"
3,It does what it says it will do.,"This game is your biggest time-waster...just as it says! Yes, it's repetitive, but it's innovative...there's nothing else just like it. Sure, it takes its origin from Tetris/Bubble Bobble/Dr. Mario/whathaveyou, but it gets full credit for originality. (Dr. Mario doesn't even get that; it's essentially Tetris with pills.)Zoop has good sound and coherent aesthetics. Personally, I enjoy the music. Gameplay is smooth, even though it is repetitive. I do wish there were more than two game modes, however. One last criticism: the triangle does move a little bit too fast, so you might accidentally shoot into oblivion. Just make sure to watch where you're shooting!If you've got time to burn and aren't bothered by the fact that it's best for action-puzzle lovers, it's a decent game. Certainly not the best game, but certainly not the worst.3 out of 5: ""It's Okay"""
3,its okay,"it gets old fast, its kind of hard to play but is fun for a little while, i remeber playing it when i was young so thats why i ordered it. i didnt mind paying four dollars for it."
1,Good beginner overview,I purchased this book as part of an development project for a new ethernet linked product. I was hoping for some detailed insight into industrial implementations. This book provides a good overview of ethernet but does NOT go into enough detail to be useful for a real world project.
2,"Guide for sculpting in water clay, not Cernit -Sculpey.","This book shows how to model a toddler doll from head-to-toe as the title suggests, but the sculpting techniques presented are more appropriate for clays used in large masses, i.e. not polymer clays like Cernit and Sculpey. A better book for sculpting young children using polymer clays is Rotraut Schrott's ""Making Original and Potrait Dolls in Cernit""."
3,Still Have Questions.,"I agree with the previous reviewer - this is definitely a better book for people making porcelain dolls than dolls from polyclay. I am fairly disappointed and still have a lot of questions. However, it was very helpful regarding sculpting over an armature and gave me some what of an idea of how to then proceed to make a mold from my polyclay piece. I also have Rotraut Schrott's book and I honestly don't find that one all that much more helpful for my purposes. I am really trying to figure out joints and making mold at this point and I am having a difficult time finding a book that will help me as they are all geared towards porcelain. And the polyclay books all assume you are making one of a kind dolls. The pictures are good in this book though and I feel I have a little more grasp on what I'm shooting for now - so I give it 3 stars which to me means average. I wish I had thought twice before buying it. There must be a better book out there."
2,sculpting & Making a Toddler Doll Head to toe in water based clay,"The photos are good, the instructions good and easy to follow. What stood out more than anything else and spoiled the book for me, is that the expression on the face of all the figures is so wooden, that is, there is nothing at all that you would expect to see in babies and children's expression. Those in the book all look extremely bored.Marion Springer"
2,Little guidance,This was very basic and had few examples to choose from when trying to form a letter. What little guidance received was common knowledge. This is best suited for high school students.
2,Overly simplistic and not academic,"I recently used this text for a Counseling Addicted Families Class I was taking as a Graduate Counseling student. I found myself circling typos and writing in questions. Curtis does not cite references properly or nearly enough, with the exception of Steinglass(1987)who is overcited, causing me to think this is just a summary of his earlier book. Her explanation of family systems and family therapy seem simplistic and archaic. Since I was taking a Marriage and Family class at the same time as the addicted families class, I was learning much of the material more in depth (& more accurate) in my other class. Reading the book was frustrating, and I would not suggest anyone read it unless required for a class. There are much better Counseling Addicted Families texts such as one by Juhnke and Hagedorn."
5,"Deep cuts & the Hits, too!!!!!!","What a pleasant surprise, there is so much more to the Brothers Johnson than Strawberry Letter 23, Stomp,etc. The deep LP cuts we played in addition to the hits are here. Titles may not be familar, but the songs are!!!! Bravo & well done, collection. Also remastered to the fullest volume & includes a wonderful booklet with The Brothers history.Please Q produce one more CD!!!!!!!"
3,Still funky,Glad to find this cd of some of the best of ole school funk. The Brothers Johnson bring back fond memories of the 70's with a few classics on this cd. Only six cuts on here for me.
2,My first Brothers Johnson experience,"I bought this album for their two hit songs. They are great. The rest of the album, however a nice funk experience, is loaded with explicit language. I cannot play it around my kids."
4,Mandolin Self Teaching,I was able to use this product only briefly as I had surgery on my hand. I was able to play some simple stuff before having to quit playing. Planning to start using this soon as I liked the format and simplicity.
1,Not complete,I wanted to buy this but the show has 78 episodes not 56 as one reviewer says.So its not a complete saga.If it had the complete 78 episodes then good but its not even stated what episodes are included in the box set. For the mandarin version 13 discs make up the complete saga. So I dont believe 7 discs can be a complete saga.[...]
1,NO ENDING,"The box set only goes through half the episodes. English subs are only done through ep 56. I cannot locate the ending ep 57-60... great story, but you will never know how it ends! A total waste of four days watching! SIGH!"
3,"An interesting, enjoyable compilation","Münchener Freiheit is one of my favorite bands, and when I was first made aware of this compilation, it piqued my interest. Zeit Maschine--released in 2003--is a greatest hits album that is comprised of re-recorded versions of their most popular compositions. The songs on this piece of work, 14 of them, are drawn from albums that were released from 1984-1994. The disc is almost 57 minutes. I like all of these new versions; I even prefer a couple of them (""Laß mich nie mehr los"" and ""Du bist Energie für mich"") to the originals. The CD booklet includes the song lyrics and a black-and-white photo of each member of the group. Also, the album cover is nice. Actually, I rate this piece of work 3.5 stars. It is recommendable."
5,Great history narrative!,"This is free online, but having it in print makes it much easier to use. We home school and use this for history. I read the narrative and they supplement with biographies and historical fiction. My kids LOVE it."
3,"Good stories, but no table of contents or index","The stories are good, but it is very irritating that my copy of the book lacks chapter divisions, table of contents, and an index. I saw this title at the library and realized it was my copy that was lacking rather than the title itself. (Ours was published by Wilder Publications, LLC) We are using it for part of our homeschool history studies, and it is a real pain to match the stories to the topic we are studying."
1,throw on the recycle pile,"Like some other reviewers I bought this book due to the Ambleside Online recommendations. I got as far as the early explorers before I noticed the anti-Catholic bias. Then I looked for the section on the Mormons noted by another reviewer. Do not give this book to your child. Even if you are Protestant, do not give this book to your child unless you are willing to sit with them through every chapter and explain the author's bias. I am sure I can find a better American History resource."
1,poor homeschooling curriculum choice,"Personally, I was considering this book for use in my homeschooling curriculum using the Charlotte Mason philosophy. Though the literary style of this book maybe of sound quality and make for an entertaining read- those of us choosing to homeschool our children to give them access to better sources of information than they would receive in a formal school setting should reconsider reading such obviously biased takes on history to impressionable children.Reading a source like this may be of value once children have reached an age of critical analysis at which they can consider for themselves the bias (and as one reviewer pointed out - prejudices and hate-mongering-)inherent in works such as these- when they could conclude that propaganda to sway public opinion is a part of many nations histories"
2,Racist,"There is nothing left wing about the racism and bias in this book. Our forefathers also were mostly slave owners so I doubt saying that they would like this book would give it any respect. This could have been a good book. Unfortunately, I don't want my kids to learn racism is appropriate. I would suggest Story of the World, though I wish there were another American History storybook like this one without the nasty bits."
2,Feel Proud to be an American,This a wonderful book to read to children or to read yourself. It tells the history of this Country of Ours in story form. This makes the reading of it very fun and exiting. The book also includes some wonderful drawings in color. Don't miss. It will make you proud to be an American.
3,"Good book, not the best edition","Although Ms. Marshall is clearly a product of her time, I found that in many instances she could have chosen sides, but instead she took a fair position. That said, this edition of the book, should you choose it, is not the best. It does not have the illustrations mentioned in another review, and lacks any dates at all (I'm assuming that's how it was written originally) - making it difficult to build a timeline from it or to get a sense of the passage of time. I prefer to use the version online at Celebration of Women Writers, which has annotations in the margins."
2,"good book, bad edition","While the content of this book is a very good overview of American history, I do not recommend this particular edition by bnpublishing (ISBN 9561001985) as it is full of typos, misspellings, and misplaced punctuation (or none at all where there should be). I also don't like the page layout: the text is too small and the column is too wide for ease of reading. Better editions are available from Yesterday's Classics or Wilder Publications. (I promise I do not work for either of these companies; I'm just a homeschooling mom trying to help others avoid my purchasing mistake.)"
2,Good book but be careful of publisher,"This is a good history spine, but I just wanted to offer a review of this publisher. Wilder Publications, while producing texts cheaply and efficiently, has produced this edition (March 09) with MANY typos. There is no table of contents, no chapter numbers, and an average of about five typos per chapter. Not a huge deal if you are reading it to your child, but if you plan to hand this edition over to your child to read alone, it may greatly confuse them. Pay the extra money and buy from a more reputable publisher!"
4,Big Powderhound Rack,"I like the rack. Then again, I haven't used any other racks to compare against these. Great price from Amazon.com though."
3,Good for the Price,"We use this on our 2011 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport, and it does the trick. Installation is a bit more of a hassel that we anticipated, but once it's on it's definitely secure. Not sure why the instructions say that factory cross bars have to be much closer together than they actually need be; ours has been just fine. There is a decent amount of whistling from the rack when traveling over 45 mph, but that's to be expected, I believe. Took off two stars because the installation was more work than we would have liked, and definitely a two-person job."
4,Case for PhotoShare 2.4,"The case fits fine over the PhotoShare photo viewer. However, we seem to use the viewer without the case as it takes up less space."
4,Wonderful compliment to the PhotoShare,This handy carrying case is designed to both protect and aid the PhotoShare to travel in style. It is a little difficult to get the unit in and out of the carrying case but the level of protection is unmatched.
1,I didn't like the Photoshare viewer,"This case was not good at all. You had to squeeze the Photoshare viewer into it to fit. Once you got it in, you needed two people to get it out.This product was returned and I bought the Kodak, it also came with a case."
4,A masterful portrayal of an intriguing woman.,"This film is highly recommended as a way to learn about Pearl Buck and the world she lived in. Told with rare sensitivity and verve, this is the story of a brave woman living in an extraordinary time and place. It will be enjoyed by experts in her work and those who know very little about her."
2,Aptly Mis-named Book,"This book should be titled ""C# - A Beginner's Reference"" This book is far from complete. It offers very little in the way of advanced reference material, and has nothing on C# Web Applications. The book is okay for a beginner's reference, but not really worth its cost for programmers who already have a background in other programming languages. This book covers the basics, basically, and that's about it. The title of this book is very misleading. I'd give it three stars; it does offer a good reference for basic material; but the misleading title brings my rating down to two stars."
4,good..,"I have bought this book for my son, hope it will be helpful for him, my son is agree with other rewiers that it is not for proffesionals but good for beginers. Thanks to seller, very fast, next day delivery."
4,KAMACH' DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is another great release for 06', its the sophmore effort, followin up from his debut album: Cult Status.....It has the same blazin production like the 1st one had, his style of bringin raw grimey raps, mixed with a spiritual side to them is still in effect......Traks like 'African Boy' 'Holy Rollers' and 'Death Choir' are excellent examples of this.....The man's lyrics is still somethin no-one is ready for.....Well rounded album, 4.5......Kamach has to be one of Philly's most slept on emcees out there, but eventually this man will get the recognition he deserves in the indie market and in the game......this album is satisfying, more than the first, lyrics have improved from the first time, and has some classic material on here that never gets old......"
4,Decent Read,"Many of the stories in this volume were not to my liking. I was a little disappointed in the condition of the binding, but overall it's a good night table book."
5,Excellent distillation of a complex subject.,"With this fine book, Sir Michael Howard again shows his mastery of military history broadly conceived and his gift for distilling a broad and complex subject. Interested readers should keep in mind that this book is a volume in Oxford University Press's ""Very Short Introduction"" series, and not expect of a book intended to start readers thinking on a subject the massive, definitive study that has been produced by scholars such as John Keegan and Hew Strachan."
4,Good introduction but very slow,"Just finished this small book. It is exactly what it says 'A Very Short Introduction'. It did give a very general overview but wasn't as clear as I would of liked. I ofter was left wondering. It also isn't written cronologically so at times becomes confusing. The author, Michael Howard also seems enjoy using fancy words when not necessary, making it difficult at times. This was my first read on WWI and feel like I am readt for more detail."
3,Decent overview but too much information had to be cut,"I'm reading a few books on WWII right now, and picked up this short introduction to get a quick overview of the great war which ultimately led to the second. The book tries the ambitious task of trying to cover a topic as large as the first world war in 130 short pages. It does about as good of a job as can be expected, but far too much detail had to be cut. I'm still not 100% sure why the war even started (I know Austria invaded a country), most of the political and cultural environmental during that time is absent and this mostly focuses on the major battles. The last chapter which mentions the reparations and lost land of Germany did prove some of the details I was looking for as to the cause of Hitler. As for WWI, I'll eventually get a more through book."
2,Too slow paced for my taste,"I had a very hard time getting through the 154 pages and almost couldn't make it. Without a doubt Howard knows a lot about WWI, but he does not write in a way that I can enjoy reading him. It took me a long time to finish this book and came out pretty empty handed. James Stokesbury (A Short History of WWI) tackles the job superbly if you want an introduction to WWI."
3,It corresponds directly with the author's last name,it has a lot of relevant information yet it has absolutely no personalit
3,Two Songs for Me,"There are two songs that leap off of this album for me. Of course, they are ""Pennies from Heaven,"" sung by the wonderfully unique Reneé Olstead and Steven Tyler's soulful rendition of ""Smile."" I prefer Michael Jackson's version of ""Smile,"" and it remains one of my favorite songs of all time, but Tyler's version is wonderfully deep as well."
2,Terrible misleading packaging,"This product does what it advertises except that you NEED to know it is not a USB hard drive - the package text reads ""hard drive+usb2.0 hub & firewire hub"" which implied it was a usb hard drive. The package is also very generic, the only way to tell hard drive size is from a sticker on it which was very unclear. The manual doesn't mention the limitation with the firewire drive until the FAQ section - it is towards the back, after a bunch of information about retrospect."
4,A well executed novel (pun intended),"Cleverly plotted, well written, Val McDermid has written a taught suspense that deals not just with the disappearance of children in England, but with the emotions of the police officers tracking the killer.The only reason I couldn't offer five stars for this beautifully written book is because I remeber the real 'Moors Murderers' in UK in the 1960s and McDermid has mixed fact with fiction in this tale. At times, I wasn't sure if I was reading a factual account or whether it was, indeed, just a novel. Maybe that was the author's intention but, for me, it distracted me a little from an otherwise brilliant piece of writing.Don't let this put you off buying this book. It's an excellent read."
5,A Fine British Mystery,"I am an American who loves British Mystery writers like Peter Robinson, P.D.James, Margaret Yorke and the peerless Ruth Rendell. If you have read any of these authors books, then you will know that it is high praise indeed to add Val McDermid to this list. This book boasts wonderful characterizations, and a superb feel for life in a tiny, isolated English village circa the early 1960's, but the cunning plot is what really shines through here. I will not detail the events that take place in ""A Place of Execution"" because I fear that I might give too many clues and ruin the experience of reading it for yourself. It was a pleasure to read a book where I was genuinely mystified by the events depicted. I just had to keep on turning the pages until I found out what really happened in the tiny village of Scardale all those years ago and why those events continued to haunt everyone touched by them."
4,Murder Mystery,"I read this book a long time ago, and actually remembered it. Purchased it as a gift for my brother."
4,Gripping,This book grabs you from the very begining. You get caught up in the frenzy of a town trying to find a lost girl. George Bennett is in charge of the investigation of Alison Carter. He finds the dark town of Scardale to be very secretive and disturbing. Their resistance even harms his case. The characters come to life on the page. This is a quick read. The novel ends with all of my questions answered. The only problem I had with the book is the summary on the back page. I think it gives too much of the story away. But that's probably not the writer's fault. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,What a read!,"This was my first book by Ms McDermid and I hope her other books are as good. This book was fantastic. I loved the charaters, I loved the story. The plot was solid, the twists were superb and it was a first-rate mystery. After being disapointed by the last P. Cornwell books, I was relieved to find another author that I can now look forward to reading. I will for sure pick up her other books. If they are half as good as this one, that's still ten times better then Blowfly and Trace put together!!!"
3,Intriguing plot but wordy,"This book reminds me of the BBC version of soap operas: well very conceived, but executed in a neurotic fashion that uses five words for every one that is needed. McDermid's writing has its moments of perceptive clarity which push it nearly to beauty, but the bulk of it is plodding descriptive text. Scenes are inefficient - this author should read more Tom Wolfe - and there's abundant energy wasted trying to sidetrack the audience from a conclusion they probably will not see. I don't know the UK, so I cannot comment on whether the assessment of Scardale is accurate or not, but I'll say that the plot of small, rural areas controlled by abusive people is so hackeneyed, overdone and beaten to death that it has been relegated to made-for-TV-movies in the USA. Overall, I liked this book as each page compelled me to read the next through plot and strength of characters, including likability of the major characters. I would recommend this book to other mystery book readers."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"This book was recommended by a friend. I love Val's books. They are usually put together well, but this one was awful. The only interesting character was the newspaper man. I think his name was Smart. See, I can't even remember the names of the characters. The story line was so apparent that I knew who the killers were by the middle of the book.Fans can take a chance, like I did, but I'm sorry, Val, I do not recommend this book."
2,Great if you need a nap,"This glum book is about 6 times as long as it needs to be, and most of the denouement is telegraphed hundreds of pages in advance. Which would be okay if the writing were fun, but it isn't--in this case, ""police procedural"" means that you get to hear about every cigarette (different characters smoke different brands, isn't that fascinating?) and every cup of coffee or tea consumed in the course of a 37-year investigation. No joke! (And I do mean NO JOKES.) At the same time, you don't learn anything very interesting about the characters as people. I finished this book on a lo-o-ong flight and then began the other book I had with me, a P. D. James that's ostensibly the same genre as this one. But it was so refreshing to start a mystery where the sentences are full of intelligence, and the characters and situations full of surprises! I'd skip this one unless you're an awful insomniac."
5,Great British Mystery,"My favorite mysteries are British mysteries and someone on Amazon's mystery threads recommended Val McDermid to me. I immediately downloaded this book on my new kindle one snowy weekend when you want to stay home by the fire and be transported to another place where a mystery awaits you.Loved the great writing and atmosphere in McDermid's writing. You feel like you're there in this rather forsaken and forlorn English village where a young woman goes missing. You like the detective and characters and can't figure out what the village is hiding from them.The plot is well-placed and riveting, and the surprise ending catches you unawares. One word of warning--some of the plot is graphic--this isn't Miss Marple country or a cosy. McDermid is a talented author; you'll probably want to read more by her as I do after this taut thriller."
3,"Simplistic, Happy Ending","Not the most sophsticated book I've read - overly simplistic and a little too ""sugary"". I love spy novels, but this isn't one of my favorites."
4,Excellent Read,"From the very beginning of the book you know that all isn't what it appears, but while the author plays fair, she doesn't tip her hand. The plot and belivability of the characters keeps the reader engaged. I've read many, many books and this is the first one in a long time that has kept me engaged from beginning to end."
2,Am I the only one who figured this out?,"Now, I'm not tooting my own horn, nor do I think I was particularly clever...but the ""shocking ending"" was, to me, obvious by about halfway through the book. I found a previous reviewer's comments interesting - the reviewer stated that upon rereading the book, he/she was able to pick up on many little things previously missed...my problem was the ""little things"" seemed glaringly to point to the ending upon initial read! Maybe I've read too many similar books to be fooled, but it was a disappointment to me."
3,"It's good, not great - Give it a 3.5","When I think about the book, it had a very good ending - one that was a surprise to me. But I give it three (and a half) stars because it could have been written more concisely. I love a good murder mystery as much as the next person (Sandford, Connolley, Kellerman), but this one moved too slowly for me.I will try her again though, because I like her style. Her character development is thorough and story line is good too.I read the whole thing cause I did want to find out the ""whodunit"", so it kept me going from that point of view.I don't recommend strongly."
5,Compelling Reading,"A girl is reported missing by her stepfather who also happens to be the squire of the very insular village of Scardale, where she lives. The officer in charge of the investigation is a young Inspector named George Bennett. It is early in Bennett's career, so this could be a make or break case for him. Because of this, he is determined to find out what really happened, leading us on a relentless pursuit of the truth. Unfortunately, the villagers of Scardale are not very forthcoming when it comes to information, almost to the point where it seems they don't want the girl found.This is an extremely intriguing plot that relentlessly drew me in as evidence slowly came to light. I found myself guessing first one conclusion, then another and still found room for another twist in the tale."
3,Surprised after the great reviews,"I was inspired to read this book after a review on Sunday Morning, and after reading the reviews here. My actual reading of the book was somewhat disappointing. The setting was interesting and the characters had integrity, but the story line was somewhat slow. The general subject of the book I found harsh and disturbing, and I would rather read more interesting ideas on better subjects. The prose was not particularly enjoyable. Not the wonderful book I had been led to believe."
4,Amazing details,"The writing alone makes this book excellent, taking the reader to the winter of 1963 and letting them live it like the characters. Other than the plodding section about the trial (I'm just not one for reading court proccedings. I find them rather dull.) the story flows well. With the exception of Catherine, who's just a little too blah, the cast is fantastic. The story itself is dark and draws the reader in. This is a great read for a cold winter's night."
3,Above Average Procedural,This is a solid police procedural set mainly in early 60s England. The plotting is ingenious and the quality of writing is good. The characters are believeable with good attention to historical detail. Decent entertainment reading.
4,Whew! I FINALLY FOUND IT.,"I do a church newsletter and was using this software until my cd drive ate it. I had been looking and looking and even tried Broderbund but couldn't find it there. Then one day while browsing, I came across it here at Amazon. THANK GOD!!! Now I am able find those clipart images I used before. I noticed that a previous reviewer said she was running Windows XP Pro and wasn't able to use the program. I too am running Windows XP Pro and have no problem opening the images I want to use. When I am searching for a particular image, I open the directory in Windows Picture/Fax Viewer and have no problem finding the image I need. Also, the cd includes a copy of the manual which explains the program as well as a program that allows you to view and print a catalog of the files on the 2 discs. Very good program. I would recommend it to anyone looking for good religious clip."
1,Caught My Mistake In Time,"NOTE:This is old software. Will not run on 64 bit machines, nor compatible with newest OS according to the publicity on Parsons' own web site.Glad I looked into this more specifically in time to cancel my order before shipping."
2,Clickart,This product is not worth the price. Alot of the pictures won't work on my computer. It is an old product. Needs to be updated or something. Most of the pictures I wouldn't really want to use for church bulletins.
3,"Okay, but missed the printed book of graphics",When the product arrived I was surprised that the manual in previous versions wasn't included.
3,Good taste - poor quality control on K-cups,"The flavor on these butter toffee k-cups is decadent, and the first few my husband and I drank were great. Now we've have 6-7 cups in a row in which the filter seems to malfunction, not allowing all the water to drain out, but LOTS of grounds. The result is a half-cup of coffee full of grounds and a Keurig to clean up. May just be a crummy box, but beware! (The Timothy's brand k-cups never give us this trouble.)"
3,Smells better than it tastes,"It's aroma is wonderful, but the flavor is not very strong. I also find it a bit bitter. But considering the limited amount of flavors available in subscribe & save program, it will do for now."
3,Stick with Timothy's or Green Mountain,"I ordered this flavor, butter toffee, based on the reviews I read. This flavor sounded wonderful and isn't one of the flavors offered by either Timothy's or Green Mountain, so I thought it was worth a try. What a disappointment! The coffee is pretty weak and the flavor is just off - certainly NOT the rich, buttery toffee flavor I was looking forward to. I guess I've gotten spoiled by the rich coffee and wonderful flavors of Timothy's and Green Mountain, and there is absolutely no comparison between those coffees and this brand. From now on, I'm sticking to the brands I can count on to deliver a wonderful cup of coffee every single time."
2,Not so much,"Gloria Jeans coffee is a little weak for my taste. Not as much flavoring. I have found that the Timothys and the green mountain have a much more intense flavor, and the coffee is stronger."
4,Yummy!,Gloria Jeans hit it out of the park on this one! Why not a 5-star? There are only 4 k-cups that get 5-star from me:Timothy's KahluaGreen Mountain BlueberryTimothy's Parisian NightsGloria Jeans German Chocolate Cake <-should be a 10-star
1,Yuck. Watered down and artificial taste.,"I purchased this based on the reviews. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but, who knows? If you like a very light watered down coffee that's loaded with what seems to be an overpowering artificial flavor, you will love this. Not my cup of ""coffee""... I gave it a sincere try."
2,Overly sweet,"I generally like Gloria Jean's flavored coffee, but I'm not too thrilled with their Butter Toffee - it tastes too syrupy and sweet for me."
3,"High energy, fast moving","This movie is one i had wondered about finding for years. I was an extra in it when i was 17 years old back when it was filmed in Chilicothe, MO. in 1956. It is not as I remember but then that has been many years ago. I thought that I would not even be found in it but I was, just in one scene toward the end but it made it wortth every cent I spent. My best friend was also in the movie, she is in 2 scenes. We neither had speaking parts but that didn't matter. The movie is not a real popular movie but who cares, when they were part of it?"
2,Strictly Dullsville,"Yawn! I love JD films (and not in that annoying, condescending ""ironic"" way! Screw you Mystery Science Theater!)...Anyway, this is just below average. Everyone is far too polite. There aren't any hot rods or custom cars. The clothes aren't that great. No cool slang. The dancing is dull. It's sorta neat to see John Ashley before he went on to the Beach Party movies, but really this just doesn't have much going for it. If you're looking for some good JD/Rockabilly/Hot Rod 50's films, I'd recommend ""Running Wild"", ""Rock Baby Rock It"" or ""High School Confidential"" for starters. Enjoy!"
2,A Bad (and predictable) Movie...with a good sound track.,"This movie is so predictable and cheaply made, but Reggie Perkins did an excellent job singing ""High School Caesar."" He also sang the title ""Date Bait Baby"". Reggie and I worked in Miami Beach area during the 50's Rock n Roll days. His singing is good....(when he's good,) but it can be bad when he's bad. For instance, I played keyboard and Reggie had a terrible habit of starting a song in the wrong key. Once he got started there was no way of getting him in the right key. Our band, ""The Rockin Maniacs"" solved the ""off key"" problem by giving him strong introductions to every song he sang. That did the trick and soon his singing was very good. Like I said, ""Bad movie"" but I think Reggie did a good job in the opening credits singing ""High School Caesar"". Personally, I thought the music in ""Date Bait Baby"" was better.Chuck Y."
2,Small town mid-America youth meet young gang boss wannabe.,"A low-budget movie shot on location with local teens as cast and extras. This is a time capsule of the early 60s with a Hollywood idea of small town mid-America life-style. It has become a staple of high school reunions in our area (and yes, some friends have billing, and others of us appear in scenes) What fun, to see our hometown as it once was, and ourselves at that time. That is the greatest appeal for most of us, although there is some acting, a couple of chase scenes, and an exciting car crash (using a vintage auto owned by a local young man.) I'm glad ""High School Caesar"" came to my town."
4,"Thank you, Barnes and company!","Tight riffing, evil vocals and a distinctly Cannibal-esque sound to many of the tracks make this Six Feet Under's best album since Warpath, and easily their heaviest. The guitar sound is bone-crunching, and notorious vocalist Chris Barnes sounds deeper than he has a very long time. Even the guest appearance from rapper Ice-T is superisingly entertaining, as the rhythm remains just as fast and the lyrics become quite graphic with the entire home invasion theme. Also notable is the guest appearance from Karyn Crisis on ""Sick And Twisted""; very nice vocal arangements in the chorus. Still, nothing beats ""Impulse To Disembowel"", which comprises all the elements of death metal I enjoy (groove, blast beats, disgusting lyrics and an overall extremely evil vibe). Nice to see these guys bouncing back; I really thought they'd almost lost it with those last two records. Congrats!"
4,Standard Death Metal,"Although SFU doesn't really bring new ideas up front, these guys are extremely talented. This is an excellent DM CD. Ice-T on a metal album is not new. He did some stuff a few years back with Pro-Pain."
3,true carnage or true garbage?? YOU BE THE JUDGE,"Well this CD IS NOT hAUNTED OR EVEN mAXIMUM VIOLENCE BUT IT IS HEAVY GROOVE DEATH METAL THE WAY cHRIS AND THE sfu GANG SPEW FORTH AS A NEW RELEASE. APPEARENCES BY iCEE t AND kAREN cRISIS PEPPER UP THIS DISK, AND SONGS LIKE THE MURDERES AND THE DAY THE DEAD WALKED ARE A GOOD LISTEN IF YOU ARE EXPECTING EXTREME BRUTALITY DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH BUT IF YOU DIG SFU AND WANT A NEW DISK BY THEM THAT KICKS GRAVEYARD CLASSICS A#S THEN PICK THIS UP OR NOT CUZ I DID AND I DID ENJOY IT!!!!"
2,Very subpar death metal,"This CD now review site is soooo misleading! I swear people are just retarded or know nothing about music sometimes. This CD is very slow simple death metal. I mean...REALLY slow and REALLY simple. Sure, a few good riffs here and there, but it's just too boring for me to even want to come back to.The only song I really care for is the Ice T one ""One Bullet Left"" At least Ice T injects some hate and adrenaline into the music...even if it's rap. It just givs some life to things.Anyway...everyone says this CD is full of groove, but ugh...not interesting at all! Buy at your own risk! I much prefer ""Bringer of Blood"" for groove. It's like this one, only much faster and headbangingesque."
2,SFU went downhill,"I am a huge fan of Warpath, but I was very disappointed with True Carnage. Chris Barnes' vocal style has changed on this one, his growl is deeper, artificially so, and unintelligible, and in doing so it seems to have lost a lot of its viciousness. Deeper doesn't necessarily mean more evil!! Even worse, he intersperses some attempts at this kind of high-pitched shriek/growl that he just doesn't pull off at all. Musically, the riffs are boring and seem stale. I think some people like the way Barnes went with this one, but I didn't feel it at all."
4,Six Feet Under's Best To Date,"I thought Six Feet Under's previous release ""Maximum Violence"" was pretty damn good. ""True Carnage"" proves to be even better. I'm glad to see that Chris Barnes' vocals are now back to the point where we actually need the lyric sheet to understand what he's saying. Alot of the low vocals on this cd have a definate ""Tomb of the Mutilated"" feel. All of the songs on this cd are note worthy. My favorites include ""The Day the Dead Walked"", ""Impulse to Disembowel"", ""Snakes"", ""The Murderers"", and ""It Never Dies"". I figured most people would despise Ice-T's preformance on this album, but like me, most people didn't really mind it all that much. Pick this album up today. It's the most gruesome SFU album yet. Love the album art."
1,Worst Death Metal Ever!,"Wow, Chris Barnes has become a joke. I truely thought that after the dissaster called 'The Bleeding' Chis would have thought about changing back into what he used to be, a metal ledgend. It is really sad what he has become. If you want real metal listen to Nile, Necrodeath, Broken Hope, Baphomet, Suffocation, Death, Dying Fetus, Imaped, Imapled Nazerean, or anything like that. Not this bull..."
4,good metal,"I thought this cd was great. The reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it kind of gets boring. vocals also drain all the other instuments out. Overall though it was a great cd to listen to. To listen to some other good bands look her: Cannibal Corpse, suffocation, nile, obituary, death, and of course cryptopsy. If I were to pick one of each band I would pick tomb of the mutilated pierced from within, in their darkened shrines world demise human and none so vile.from a 14 yr old death metal fan!!"
1,"Good Music, But Terrible Vocals!!!","I'm suprised a metal band like Six Feet Under, is still making music. Don't get me wrong the music is great to bang your head too, but Chris Barn's vocals are beyond horrible. One thing that annoys me is grunting and moaning vocals like his. All bands like Cannibal Corpse and Obituary shouldn't even be making albums. Because personally they down right (arent good)and their frontmen show you no speck of talent with their voices. If I was in a band that had a vocalist this bad I would throw his (rear) out!!!"
3,When is the therapy going to start?,"Although I love this venue of music, I can only think of one thing to say, Chris Barnes needs to seek psychiatric help and soon. I found the lyrics extremely repulsive. I'm not easily shocked, I've worked prisons for the last 10 years and am also a war vet, but this ... is not art. Love the sound, hate the lyrics."
1,"Weak, generic, lame death metal","This album is VERY weak. I think Maximum Violence is solid (check out that riff on Victim of the Paranoid!), but this effort leaves me cold. Barnes tries to produce the most intense death metal vocals ever, but in the end just sounds like he's trying too hard. Ultimately, he can't hold a candle to any of the death metal bands with good vocalists (think Cryptopsy, Hate Plow, or Malevolent Creation).If blazing fast technical drumming is your thing, forget it. Unoriginal lyrics (perverse, yes; interesting in the slightest, no!), sludgy guitar work, and lame composition add up to one of the most pathetic death metal albums in years. Stay away from this and go by None So Vile by Cryptopsy..."
2,The well has run dry,"I've followed SFU from the beginning and felt that each album has gotten a little worse than the prior one, mainly due to lack of originality (don't get me wrong the first 3 albums are great). Now I feel the well has run dry and I don't find the material interesting anymore. The only track I cared for off this album was ""One Bullet Left"" which features Ice-T (the rapper Jordan's review was referring to, but he doesn't ruin the song as he's got metal cred, remember Body Count??). Chris' vox have gotten especially tiresome over the years."
3,Not as good as Maximum Violence,"This cd starts off promising with ""impulse to disembowel"", but that song falls short because it is way too repetetive, picks up and then gets alright. but then you start to realize that chris' vocals are completely undecipherable on this album. not only do they lack a punch, they aren't even like growls theyre like heavy breathing, which can get nerve racking after listening to maximum violence and loving that album. also, chris' rat screech just sounds ridiculous. ""the day the dead walked"" is one of the better songs, along with ""sick and twisted"", ""one bullet left"" and maybe a few others. but ""snakes"" is the worst death metal song ever written. ice-t adds some sweetness into the mix, and does not disappoint with his rap, which is more like the phrase ""mother f____er"" like 30 times in a row. a disappointment, i expected more from the guys who brought us ""feasting on the blood of the insane"""
1,Bad Company To Deal With,"Buyers beware when dealing with LaCrosse. When my new waders cracked and fell apart I contacted Lacrosse and the told me they could do nothing about it. Said they were made in America when my boots were made.If you are looking for boots, dont buy Lacrosse. You will be sorryHope this helpsDan"
3,Sensitive type.,"Received as described but for some reason, has an issue with derailing. My other engines and cars don't derail, so I can't figure out why this one does so and attribute it to the fact that it's just the sensitive type."
3,"Works OK, one flaw","Seems to work OK, video switches aren't that complicated. However, there is one flaw: the instructions state that you must use all composite-only (red/white/yellow plugs) or all S-video devices. I tried to mix devices (DVD player on S-video, game system on composite) and it didn't work.I was under the impression that since I hooked up an S-video cable to the switch as the output to the TV, all signals sent from the switch would be via S-video, not so. The input device also has to be S-video or you get no video. I.e. you can't hook up a game system using composite-only and have the video switch output via S-video.It's not a deal breaker for me, but it sure would have been nice to use S-video for my DVD player and composite for my game systems (that don't support S-video). Unless all of your devices use S-video, there's really no reason for this to even have the ports."
1,Bad Product,This product did not work at all. It would only allow one product to work. You could hook all the others up but only the first one would work. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,"This is not a ""mountain bike"" book!","Do not buy this book if you are looking for mountain bike trails and descriptions of such. This guy likes to tell you every minute detail of the fire roads and dirt roads that he took (including telling you where to stop for a rest, and weather or not to take a right here or a left there, as if you were taking the book with you on the trail!) and tells little to nothing of the single track that these areas may or may not offer. Anyway, the way he describes these back roads and the views from them, you have not need to explore them.Gnthi seauton."
4,A must-have for Laaz fans,"If you're a fan of Laaz, one of the best B-level metal bands of the '80s, then you're almost guaranteed to love this DVD. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because there's little of drummer Victor Agnello, because he wasn't able to participate in the making of the DVD. (He's now... a medical doctor!)"
1,Not as good as THE SKYPIRATE,"I read THE SKYPIRATE first, and absolutely adored it. One of my favorites of all time. So of course I went looking for the first book in this set. LORD OF THE STORM was a terrible disappointment to me. I found Shaylah's behavior just plain annoying, and Wolf's not much better. The best thing about it was seeing Califa (heroine from SKYPIRATE) as she is here, which makes a wonderful contrast.For my money, get SKYPIRATE and pass this one by."
2,Should have listened to Glyneth...,"Glyneth, a fellow reviewer of this book, was entirely correct - this book is far inferior to The Sky Pirate, especially if you read TSP first. Lord of the Storm would have made an OK reading if you like mild futuristics - low to medium amounts of action, angst, and attitude that are prevalent in TSP. Satinskper recited the plot perfectly, however there is not enough world building and side characters to keep the book engrossing. A few times it became too hard to suspend disbelief: Shayla alone flies a starcruiser that takes a whole crew to operate, Wolf - a slave king - is guarded by only one drunk... OK, I am spoiling the book, so I'll get to the point: Do not read TSP first and then try to read LOTS - Book 1 then 2, or just Book 2."
1,Interesting idea...,"This novel is about a spaceship captain, who during shore leave falls in love with a handsome slave named Wolf. It started off okay, but I was disappointed when the heroine uses a mind controlling device to essentially trick the hero into believing she was someone else and having sex with him. This is rape. This wasn't romantic at all and was quite squicky. I gave up on it after that scene.."
5,Great Scenery Book!,Bill McClanahan was a master of scenery and scenery techniques. This book was my first scenery book and certainly ranks among the best. Bill McClanahan used the materials and methods available to him at the time he wrote the book. It offers a good choice of techniques to add scenery to your model railroad. I recommend this book to anyone that is getting ready to add scenery or upgrade their layout.
1,I watched so you won't have to!,"I'm a pretty easy going guy, look at movies not for their reality content but for entertainment and enjoyment. I routinely disregard bad reviews by ""the pros"" and will make up my own mind-more often than not completely disagreeing with their assessment. With this movie, DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU!This was without a doubt the poorest, most juvenile, poorly acted POS I have ever seen. It makes ""Ishtar"" & ""Showgirls"" look like Academy Award quality movies. I was saying to friends that it looked like a art class project, but that was slanderous to student film makers."
1,Cheap Diamond....,"I got this in mail and returned in the next day, The diamond looks so cheap, a lot of black dots inside, easy for you to see by eyes. I'm not gonna buy any diamonds from amazon any more,kind of waste my time & money."
2,Fighter's History,"This game is a total rip off of STREET FIGHTER and a bad one at that. It's fun but only because you might as well be playing SF II. The characters are very similar and if some of you remember, this is the game that got people into an up roar because if it's vast similarities to SF II.I'd skip this one and just go with the original SF II. If you;re looking for other great fighting games, check out FATAL FURY 2 SPECIAL, ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT 3, STREET FIGHTER ALPHA 2 or even BALLZ. Really, do yourself a favor and skip this one!"
5,carter's keepsake box,"perfect for keeping all the little keepsakes, plus it has a drawer to put the memory book in."
4,Adorable Bos,"This box is really cute. It has great little compartments for all different size keepsakes. The baby book fits perfectly in the bottom drawer. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that there isn't much room for cards and full size papers. I like to keep all of the cards from the first year and if they are bigger than the average card, they don't fit. You can however take out the boxes on the inside and use that space."
4,Adytum Esoterica reviews Francois Linke book,"Art noveau interpretation of classical French Style can't be really bad. Butthis book needs multiple editions to knock the First Edition price to well below$2475 (WOW!!!) Only museums and a few private hands can afford this maker. To seeexamples get the Levy antique catalog from Palm Springs, Florida."
3,"Great, but too short","All the positive things the other reviewers have said are true. This is an inspiring book filled with positive values, and it gives valuable insight into how Bill Bradley thinks and feels.But the book is extremely brief -- it's about a half-hour read. It would make a terrific magazine article, and such an article alone would be worth the cost of the magazine. But there just aren't enough words there to be worth the cost of a book, even at a discount price."
3,"Great, but not quite a book","All the positive things the other reviewers have said are true. This book is inspirational and uplifting, and it gives good insight into what makes Bill Bradley Bill Bradley.Alas, though, there's not much to it. My complaint is that it's not substantive to be a book. There aren't many pages, the margins are big, and there's lot of space between the lines. This would have made a substantive magazine article, but it's hardly a book."
1,great sound - as long as you remain completely still,"With the mixed reviews here, I figured I'd give these the benefit of the doubt and try 'em. I hooked them up directly to my soundcard(listening to mp3s around the house) and adjusted accordingly. The sound was ok(no frills corded headphones) if I was sitting at the computer. But try turning your head or -god forbid- walking around and leaving the room, and you're quickly blasted with static and hissing. I should have listened to another reviewer, who recommended waiting for the 2.4 ghz models. Guess I'll give the Amphony model a looksee next."
2,"Acceptable while it lasted, but...","No wireless headphone is ever going to sound like a good direct wired headphone. I knew that going in, and I found the sound quality acceptable. Not up to a good direct wired headphone, but pretty good in the context of a wireless headphone. Wireless range is somewhat limited, I was not able to get a noise free signal in all the rooms of my house. All that would have satisfied my wireless expectations but...The darn thing crapped out after a few months. This unit is not up to Sennheiser's usual quality. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
3,Not that comfortable,"It is an handy & light weight earphone, but the ear pads are too small. For some people with big ears, Maybe it would not fully cover...."
1,Buyer beware...,"These are a waste of you're time. These headphones are by far the worst product that I've had the misfortune of procuring. They cut out during the first few minutes of operation, then stopped working completely. Nice. Without equal, the worst product i've ever purchased from Sennheiser. Most like it will be the last."
1,Didn't work for me,"These headphones were defective and I had to return them. For the 10 minutes they worked, they sounded great."
1,Do NOT waste your money.,"Frequency range is pretty good on these headphones, and they have a much better bass response than most open air type headphones. BUT, the amount of noise/static you have to put up with in order to listen to anything is nothing short of astonishing. Even after adjusting the headphones to eliminate the noise, just the slightest nod of your head will generate a pop/hiss/crackle that makes you wonder just what you spent your money for. Add to this the incredibly strange volume control problems as the volume significantly decreases over the course of playing a single CD. (This is not a charging issue. If you start playing a CD on the first track, but select another track to play, the volume will drop by more than 75% between the tracks--EVEN IF YOU'VE ONLY BEEN USING THE HEADPHONES FOR A FEW SECONDS.) I chose to return these and have to rate them as ultra-[garbage]. I'm only giving these one star because I can't give them a ZERO."
2,Not bad but dissaponted,First off I asummed too much in that [expensive] wireless headphones were going to be anywhere near the quality of even 100 dollar headphones. I was skeptikal in the first place but I couldn't demo them at the store because they had to be charged first. I decided to try them and I am dissapointed. Id say their worth about a 100 for the feautures and quality. I wouldn't by cordless headphones for about 5 years when the technology is signifigantly better. It had signifigant static reguardless of where the reciver or the headset was. It is not as comfotable as many headphones but it is not awful the quality is that of 50 dollar headphones. If the volume is turned up the bass becomes awful similar to that of a blown speaker. I do not reccomend the rs85s but I do reccomend sennheiser corded headphones of all sorts.Matt Katona
2,The first foot steps for cordless headphones,"The first generation of Sennheiser Wireless headphones was just about OK if you did ot leave your livingroom and faced the transmitter......The RS 40 is deffinitelly better, however if you leave the room where the transmitter is placed and dare to go to the garden or one floor up the noise becomes unbearable.Wait for the 2.4 gigahertz version - The RS40 is not worth it.The cheapest corded headphones sound better."
3,For Genre Fans,"Pre ""Stagecoach"" Wayne. Valuable for watchers of the actor learning his trade in a potboiler westerns industry. I enjoyed them as a fan of the westerns from the 30s. The production values of these 3 movies is above avg. for these films but still potboilers."
3,Early 30's John Wayne Oaters,"Welllll, it is John Wayne. And they are Westerns. And they do remind me of the stuff I used to watch Saturday mornings a long time ago. But Wayne really isn't very good just yet. And these really aren't very good movies, either.Although it's interesting to see Wayne while he was learning his trade, you'll only watch these once. If you're a collector, you'll want these for your collection. Personally, I doubt that I'll ever watch them again. And I really like many of Wayne's movies, like The Searchers, Liberty Valance and The Quiet Man.Anyhow, 10 years later Wayne's stuff was much better - try 1944's ""Tall in the Saddle."" It's a lot better and a lot more like the future Wayne. And if you like the movies from that era, you should take a look at some of Randolph Scott's stuff, too."
2,Slightly Disappointed,"I have used many Life Guide bible studies before and have been quite pleased with them. However, this one disappointed me. In almost every lesson there were a few questions that were very difficult to answer or confusingly worded. I had numerous ladies in my bible study group calling me asking for clarification. The leader's section in the back tended to dance around these difficult questions without giving specific answers. If I had it to do over, I would not use this particular study guide on Proverbs."
1,This is a joke,"This ""article"" is a joke. $5.95 for 1300 words and it does not include any of the mentioned figures or any information on NMR. Makes me wonder where the quality control is."
3,"Same old stuff, different book","These are mostly line drawings cribbed from photographs in the old 1950s Army hand-to-hand manual, FM 21-150. There is nothing really new. It is the ""combat Judo"" that was popular with armies after World War II."
5,Great Song Collection,"This album has many great artists, new and old to bluegrass music. These are all great songs, NOT like some collections that you might buy for one or two songs, the rest being songs you don't like or skip through. I listen to BLUEGRASS TODAY over and over again, at work, in the car, at home. I am very pleased ! I love it!"
2,Not your typical Bluegrass,"I had thought this would be a Bluegrass CD, but I don't concider most of the music on it to be that. More Country than Bluegrass. Not happy at all with most of the selection of songs."
5,Everything I expected and more.,I used this product at work. My husband is the one that spent the money for me to have it at home. I love it.
5,nice to have no problems,Seller was great!sent the product in a timely mannner.Just like you buy at the store is how the Outlook is.Worked with out user intervention.Real happy camper.
1,Infuriating to use,"Everyone uses office. Everyone is familiar with office. So why did MS change the interface to make it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get anything done? I am computer savy (I'm an engineer) and I find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating. Worst of all there is NO way to go back to the ""old"" drop down menu system. It honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word/powerpoint because they've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons. MS claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you're familiar with the ribbons. I don't know/care whether that's true or not. The learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new UI is immense. So much so that the time investment to become proficient FAR FAR FAR out ways any ""increase"" in productivity....not to mention that it's overpriced. Offce 2003 is a far superior product."
4,So So,Great product if you wanna drop the 500 dollars to get it!bad side if your working with people that have 2003 prepare for a headache
1,Amazon and office 2007,"I purchased product the 1st of February 2010 for 571.00 now amazon has it for 362.00 and a free 2010 upgrade. They have done nothing to even extend the offer to those who just spent over $200.00 more with no upgrade. Feels like robbery to me, last time I ever use Amazon. Amazon has taken advantage of their customers."
1,Microsoft Office Ultimate 2007 FULL VERSION [DVD],Never recueved the product. Waiting for refund for over 6 weeks.
1,Fake copy,The copy I received did not work. It was a disc with junk on it. If it seems to good to be true it is. I did get a prompt refund without reporting this seller to Microsoft. My rating is a ZERO!!!
1,I still have not recieved it,"I still have not recieved this product. I have sent emails to the vendor reguarding this and have gotten no responce. Please contact me and help me resolve this issue, or refund the purchase price"
5,Excellent Software,The software arrived within 4 days and I have had no problems with it at all. It has been wonderful for my new business.
5,Microsoft Office Ultimate,Product delivered as advertised. Came in unopened case with security codes intact. All applications of Office Ultimate loaded without issue.
5,WELL WORTH SPENDING THE TIME TO ADAPT,"It is well worth spending the time it takes to adapt to the different concept of the presentation. It is fun trying to find out how to do things that in the previous version were done automatically. When you find the solution, you see that the options the new version puts at your disposal are much greater than were available in the 2003 version"
5,This book changed the way I look at life,"When I came across this book I was looking for something to explain what seems to be happening to us as a humankind, and on a personal level, something to give me hope in the kind of world I want for my children. This book made me see the process of our ""Sacred Quests"" in a way that I had never considered before. It is a must for people who are seekers, who want to understand how to connect with life in order to derive meaning and purpose, joy and hope. I have passed this book on to my family as gifts in hopes that they too will feel the magnificent connection to something greater than themselves while reading it. It is absolutely an amazing work!"
4,"Fun, but not easy","We are making a bunch of woodworking projects for a club and found a number of likeable, mildly challenging woodworking projects to make around the home and for the club. For the money for a used book, this is a wonderful item. It taught my son a lot about measure twice, cut once, which is a very important skill to have."
2,Dated Book,"The book is very dated and the projects are not very interesting or unusual, but with children to think about, many of the patterns will have appeal. Surprisingly there are few books on plywood projects."
1,"""Ear Poopy""","Listen, I could sit here and write about what a big King's x fan I am and compare this album with previous releases. I won't waste your or my time... This album stinks- pure and simple. It sounds as if all the good material had been diverted into solo projects and all that was left was THIS stuff. There are, I would say, about three songs on this record worth listening to: False Alarm, Static, and Skeptical Wind. Out of those, Skeptical Wind is the only keeper. Ty must have been completely out to lunch. My hunch is that this is just further evidence of the decline of a truly great band. If you don't have the albums ""Ear Candy"" and ""Tapehead"", get those. They'll give you a much more accurate picture of what this band is able to achive. Oh, and just a quick note to Doug, Ty, and Jerry; The next time you plan on putting so little effort into an album, give us all fair warning."
3,trying to adapt,"well I bought the cd on its release date,and popped it in my cd player and at first I was impressed,but I still cant get used to their new expierimental sound.The drum loops dont seem to fit in anywhere and they're nothing but a earsore to listen to.And I can only can count only 3 or 4 good songs on this cd.""yeah"" and ""skeptical winds"" and""Static"" are just terrible songs for KX!!>This effort by them seems only half hearted and not to thier potential.""Mr. Boulbous"" was far better than this one.but they seem to be too distracted with thier side projects than with KX.""Manic"" seems like one of thier side projects.And I cant wait for the next KX cd side project to come out and see what else they come up with.But I believe they have one more SOLID effort left in them like times of old before they call it quits!!so......you die hard fans, have faith..."
2,Experimental Letdown,"This album just plain sucks. I love King's X and own every album they have ever released but this does not come up to par with all the other albums, not even Ear Candy. This album has a few good songs but the rest is almost unbearable. The grooves are here but the music and soul isn't. Really disappointing album by them."
2,My least favorite King's X CD to date,"I gave it 2 stars only because it's one of my favorite bands, I own all their CDs and this one stunk the most IMO.I HIGHLY suggest listening to the samples before buying this unless you want a complete King's X collection.The GOOD news is their latest CD XV is REALLY good!Noah"
3,Worst of the Best ?,"Let me say first of all that King's X is one of my favorite bands, but I have to be honest here. This seems to me to be their weakest album to date. While there are a few decent tracks, the album as a whole doesn't seem to seem to be up to the same musical standard that I expect from these guys.This album almost sounds as if they're just screwing around, which can work for some bands at times but not it this instance.I have only listened to the album all the way through a few times and maybe this is one of those albums that needs to be listened to many more to get the most out of it. This album was a little bit of a let down for me because the last album was in my opinion one of their best. With all of this being said though, this is still a good album compared with what else is out there today and it has a couple of good moments, (Vegetable, Jenna). In the end this is a King's X album and that's still a good thing"
4,keep on keeping on,"Anybody by now who would buy an album by this band is obviously a hardcore fan.So they should all agree this is not a masterpiece but a contiuation of another slew of consistently good albums by this band.""vegetable""cannot be denied by any kings x fan. Rock on texas soul brothers!"
1,Moon fever?,"It hurts to write this, but this album is frankly a huge disappointment. There are two - and at a push - three good songs: False Alarm, Believe and Vegetable. But even the last two aren't exactly earth-shattering. Where have they gone wrong? I can only guess that King's X are trying too hard to be different and wacky. Check Jenna - it starts brilliantly, then drowns in a morass of atonal chords and a chorus as uninspiring as George W Bush's IQ. They simply don't see this track through to a satisfying conclusion. So, what do you get for your money? Just a lot of avant-garde noodling and post-Seattle pretension, as far as I can tell. They've even thrown in some studio 'larks' at the end with 'Water Ceremony'. Laugh? I nearly did. Here's to the next album. And perhaps, some real songs."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!,"What's going on here guys? I was a big fan of King's X since Out of the Silent Planet and Gretchen Goes to Nebraska. I was eagerly anticipating this release, especially since it was released on the Metal Blade label. Ohhhh how my expectations were crushed. What the hell is with all this updated electronic looping (...)? You guys have lost all credibility with this mess. I won't even bother to review the songs since I only made it through six of them before I through the cd out my car window in complete disgust. Thanks for nothing!"
2,The Magic Is Gone,"Let me preface this by saying I have been a fan of these guys since day one. I named my son after Ty Tabor, such was my admiration and respect for King's X. I have seen them live several times and own every album.Having said all that, I couldn't wait for ""Manic Moonlight"" to get over with. One reviewer mentioned the ""subtle"" use of drum programming. PLEASE! Every song starts with a drum loop or some other concocted sampled sound. And they aren't even original. (Read the liner notes.) The first song is the only one I can stand. ""Static"" is a close second. The rest are just plain boring and void of heart. ""Skeptical Winds"" goes on for nearly seven minutes and never goes anywhere. I couldn't wait for it to end.There was a day when these guys were the best. But the magic is gone.(sniff)"
5,Great New Album,"Just bought the album and it's great! A true joy for any KX fan. A great new sound, with hints of ""Gretchen Goes To Nebraska."" Doug's vocals and bass are outstanding, Ty's guitars are edgy and full throtle, and Jerry's drums pound with the force of a true drum god. Buy this album!"
2,"Dull, Dull, Dull","King's X has always been hit or miss. Unless you're a devoted fan, take a pass on Manic Moonlight. I'd write more here, but it's been a very long time since I listened to it, and it's really a very forgettable CD."
1,Aaargh!,"I own every King's X release on CD and cassette.......except for Manic moonlight. I guess I'm not diehard like I used to be, when I lived for music. The only thing I can say is that King's X is my favorite band. Some of their releases I did not care for at first listening, but the more you hear the better it gets! Saw them when Mr. Bulbous was touring, and just found out they'll be in town in less than a month! I'll be there!Some moron I was acquainted with once made the statement that when you reached a certain age, your music preferences should change..........DOH! That could not be further from the truth. I'll celebrate my 47th year in Dec. Rock On!"
3,Definitely Different...,"If this was any other band, I'd give it 4 stars. But my expectations are much higher with these guys! I got this CD the day it came out & have listened to it every day since, so I've had time to chew on it a little bit. In my opinion, the best tracks are ""Believe"", ""Manic Moonlight"", ""Vegetable"", & ""Jenna"". The rest of the songs have some good moments in them, but the songs overall are not up to par with what I'm used to hearing from King's X. Like others have said on this site, it seems that if they had taken some add'l time to work on melody, arrangements, etc. it would be greatly improved. The production is not quite as sparkling as it has been on their recent releases. The bass overshadows the guitar at times, & I find myself occasionally straining to hear what Ty is playing. It's still a pretty good CD, but possibly my least favorite from King's X (and I have them all!)."
5,Back to Greatness!,"King's X has put out yet another great album! After the last record came out (King's X worst .... in my opinion) I believed that the band might be on a decline ..... fast forwarding to this album though, one can tell that this group is still one of the best out there, and they are far from finished. I never thought I'd hear drum looping on a King's X album, but it works ohhhh so well. Jerry's drums sound tight, Doug's bass sounds thunderous as ever, and Ty's guitar work shows why he is truly one of the best guitarist ever in rock-n-roll. Lyrically, not the bands best, but there's a lot to chew on. I can't take this cd out of my car; each day I rediscover how great the music on this album is!"
5,The truth about Jane and all of us.,"First time this film was played on tv, i must have had about a thousand ppl telling me ""hey! check it out!"" Sounded, for the first time, that someone had the right idea about what happens to a teen when they have to go trough the hard time of finding out who they are. This film should be watch by as many ppl as posible...This film shows the beauty of the innocent of a first love, the hard times one have to suffer to be who you really are, to be all alone and then discover that your loved by many, just simply by been you. A movie that any one should have in there collection."
5,The Truth about Jane,"Indeed, this movie expressed its point in a very clean and tasteful way. I liked how it wasn't raunchy like a lot of other movies that were giving the same message. It is a good drama, and I recomend it to anyone who might be looking for a decent drama."
5,*****A WINNER*****,"cool flick,,,,kept me interested throughout the entire film...check it out...you wont be sorry..."
1,BORING,"Of all of the ""coming out"" films I've seen, this has got to be one of the worst, in spite of the cast. Spend your time and money on something more worth while. This is a total waste of time AND money.Vendor was great, however, in getting film to me on time and in good condition, as advertised. Would recommend the vendor, just not the film."
3,not a good movie... but i liked it anyway,"pretty cheesy, with a mediocre script, variable acting (stockard channing & rupaul are ok though), and that afterschool special feeling. however, it hits all the important coming-out issues in a nice way. i like cheesy melodramas, and i have a soft spot in my heart for coming-out stories--or any gay stories, really--so i enjoyed it. but great art it is not."
5,I asked Jerry.,"Having never listened to Ted Leo until recently, I can't make any statements or express any opinions about this album's comparison to those prior to it. However, I can say this: this one is wonderful. The album's bright textures are evidenced on tracks like ""where have all the rude boys gone?"" and the listener gets a taste for Ted Leo's masterful lyrics and/or politics on ""The High Party"" and the title track, ""Hearts of Oak"" to name a few. Leo's powerful, and at times, wonderfully shrill, voice carries the layered, clean guitar lines in time with an eclectic array of percussive instruments, which can be found on almost every track. After giving this a listen, and a second, and a third, and a fourth and so on, I am going off as soon as I can to purchase ""The Tyranny of Distance"". ""Hearts of Oak"" hasn't left my CD player since the day I bought it, and I'm sure it won't for a long time to come. I recommend this to anyone who has a taste for great politics, great music, and great lyrics."
5,incredible,anyone who likes indie should get this cd! just buy it... it is so amazing and i love the lyrics! this band has become one of my favorites! diverse and highly melodic.... awesome riffs and voice variations!
3,Best when fast,"Decent collection of the slightly unique rocker's material does not work for me as an excellent album but merely as an appetizer to pursue Leo a little further for the few tracks when he does truly excel. And those three or four tracks that just absolutely kill their competition happen to be the ones that continue on at breakneck pace, substituting the album's majority of melodic and vocal floundering for subtle and concise touches which aid to obliterate with a catchiness that all but overshadows everything else."
5,I hope this album will land the top spot in,"everyone's TOP 50 albums of the year!If self-styled indie snobs finally came to their senses, they'd stop drooling over Radiohead (easily the most overrated band this side of the beatles...) and start raving about TED LEO.Forget your snobbery for a second: ok, Ted Leo is not ""experimental"" (but hey, by now neither Radiohead are, go listen to Oren Ambarchi or some Tzadik stuff if you want true out-there stuff) but he has a talent for catchy melodies that's almost beyond belief. His music is imbued with rock, punk, mod and even funk! It's an energetic listen, every second as strong as his previous album.Buy this!"
1,Save your money,This is one of the most unlistenable pieces of drivel I have ever put in my CD player. I literally could not bear to listen all the way through a single song (and I tried them all). The CD became a frisbee in less than an hour.
4,Another gem from Leo,"Leo again gives us another great album. It is certainly in the same vein as Tyranny of Distance as it doesn't depart stylistically, but this is good, because that was a great album. Moving in out of quick and fast tempos Leo and the Pharmacists calls upon bands like Thin Lizzy (which they give a great tribute on Treble in Trouble) as other reviewers sad Costello. The influence from Chisel preserves a harder twinge which blends well with the more mature style of Leo's Pharmacist days. What is fun about both of his Pharmacist albums is that they are fun, hard and pure rock. They avoid the over ""emo""-tional trend which makes some bands take themselves a bit too serious. From start to finish Hearts of Oak is about good rock, good feelings and uplifting. Summer music, and good!"
5,Another great album...,"I've been a fan of Ted Leo's songwriting ever since he fronted the legendary Chisel(gern blandsted records) and he delivers with another great album. Think early Elvis Costello, The Jam, The Who, Big Star... Although I wouldn't call this his finest work (that distinction going to the the two Chisel LP's and the Tej Leo? Lp) it's still a fantastic rock record and I highly recommend it.<if you want a real treat, try to track down the ""storm of the Century"" CD ep. I don't remember what label it was on, or if more than a couple hundred were pressed, but the Chisel track ""chiefs"" is absolutely brilliant.Once again, buy hearts of oak, and everything Ted has ever played on...if you're a fan of well written, edgy guitar pop, you won't be dissapointed..."
3,Just an Okay Camera,"Nigth pictures are not good (blurry and dark).No AF Assist beam (Auto-Focus Assist) which is the little light on the front of the camera right next to the optical viewfinder. It helps to ""see in the dark"" if you will. It trains on what you have the camera pointed at so the camera has better light to get a focus lock."
2,Sending it back,"I purchased this camera this month and have been very disappointed in it, in fact I am returning it. I wanted it as a small camera to carry with me in purse or pocket. The photos were disappointing. The colors were not accurate in any but scenic mode. There was a lot of noise on most settings. As a small problem some important buttons were placed exactly where you would hold it, making you hit them at any time. I would advise against this one. I just wanted to say that Amazon has been great about returning it. Still on the lookout for a small carry-round camera. Wish me luck."
4,Second best Compilation,If you really want to get a good overview of the career of this legendary get 'Portrait of a Legend' because the overall standard of that CD is better.Still this CD is worth buying because it has all the good songs and most of all has 'Yeah Man' (probably better known as Sweet Soul Music by Arthur Conley).The best reason to get it is because it contains a previously unreleased but great song that is also the title of this CD.
4,A moody collection,"Husky vocals and slow, sultry melodies are the highlights of What's Mine is Yours. The style is intimate, akin to something heard in a smokey lounge. Each track blends well into the next, but I'd have to say that the stand out is I Know Your Name. Its low rhythm glides along your senses."
5,Global Harmony,"I love this pendant. It is high quality, the chime is beautiful and I wear it very frequently. Shiipping was quick and packaging was secure and protectve."
4,introspective of Native American values,"I found this book while looking for material for a Native American literature/cultural unit. In a collection of aphorisms grouped by category (values, land and environment, women and men, etc.), it offers nuggets in the goldmine of Native American beliefs. Having read it, I feel I do better understand the values of Native Americans. The ""voices"" from the 1800s to today speak softly but eloquently of the need for harmony with nature, with each other. On a practical note, this book is great for busy people; I think it is best appreciated if read in small increments, taking time to think about what the ""speaker"" has said."
4,IS FUN!,"Super Runabout is fun for me and I've never get tired of playing it,This game let you drive anywhere you wanted and freedom to crash any cars you like,but don't crash to much if you did your car well not work again.Super Runabout has 6 mission that you need to complete and there's a 4 racing track you can race around San Francisco.There one thing I was disappointed that it doesn't include is a rumble compatiple.I don't know why they didn't have that on there game,my controller will shake alot crashing all those cars.I Wish Interplay make another Super Runabout 2.END"
1,Total Trash,"I've played the import and it flat out stinks. Too bad too, because conceptually, it's pretty strong, although unoriginal. Sloppy control makes this game zero fun. I don't know if the control is supposed to be realistic or not, but Super Runabout is far from either simulation or arcade-style fun. Mediocre graphics will not help you overlook the absence of playability and fun. Rent first if you really must."
5,Still sounds good after all these years!!!!,"Even though it's over 20 years old, Poet is still one of my favorite records. My mother had it on wax, and finally had to get rid of it. When I ordered the CD, it was like being transported back in time. As long as the oldies are on CD, I'll never have to listen to that noise they call music on the radio."
1,"an insult to the late, great Bruce Lee","This game is an insult to the late, great Bruce Lee. Actually, all versions of this game (SNES, Genesis, Game Gear, and Atari Jaguar) are insults to Bruce Lee. The graphics leave a lot to be desired (ever heard of a sight for sore eyes? Well, this is a sore for sight eyes), the gameplay resembles about a million other side-scrolling beat 'em ups, and quite frankly, there are side-scrolling beat 'em ups MUCH MUCH better than this...go with Final Fight or Streets Of Rage instead."
2,Nothing frothy here,"I guess I was expecting something different, this just tastes like flavored coffee, not even sure what the flavor is. Nothing creamy or frothy about it."
4,Delicious!,What else do I need say for coffee for my favorite coffee maker. The only thing else I need is some latte
2,Tastes like instant coffee.,"I purchased this coffee thinking that it would be creamy and slightly flavored. I was wrong on both counts. It brews like black coffee and has no hint of cream, and I don't add much cream to black coffee so I was surprised that I needed to with this. I could not detect the cinnamon. It also has a slightly bitter after taste, which reminds me of instant coffee crystals.The only way I could figure out to make this taste like a cappuccino was to add 1/4 cup steamed milk and a little ground cinnamon, and brew the tall cup (for a 16 oz. to-go mug). But I was expecting to just brew and go. I have to say, I'm quite disappointed."
2,Very disappointing- no milk or cream in this- just coffee,"I ordered this thinking it would be like the Tassimo Cappuccino with frothy milk in the coffee but it is just coffee! I brewed the first cup and it is absolutely black. A previous reviewer said this is just coffee with cremora in it, but I didn't get an inkling of any cremora at all- just black coffee with a slight cinnamon flavor. The taste was good when I added creamer, but just disappointing- how can they call it cappuccino when it isn't?"
3,"Decent, but not great","I like rich coffees from my Keurig coffee maker, like Timothy's Paresian Nights or Rainforest Espresso. The Gloria Jeans coffees are weaker...decent tasting when brewed for single normal cup size, but not full and rich like those named above. Gloria Jean's Cappuccino isn't great at making travel cup size large cups...too watery for me. For people who think the Timothy's coffees or Emeril's Jazzed Up coffee or Newman's Own (made by Green Mountain) are too strong, Gloria Jean's might be just right for you. Taste is smooth and nice, just not very strong."
3,coffee,A little weak compared to Green Mountain which is a little more expensive and richer in flavor.
2,Not Capp!,"Like others have said, this product is in no way related to cappuccino. The other Gloria Jean's have been good; but this product is more of a bland, mild coffee whose flavor is acceptable at best."
1,Nasty if you ask me,I have had other Gloria Jean's coffee flavors and have enjoyed them. The Cappuccino tasted NOTHING like at a real Cappuccino and was a poor excuse for a cup of coffee!
3,Don't Expect a Real Cappuccino...,If you are expecting a nice frothy cappuccino then don't get this. This is more of a slightly cinnamon flavored coffee with Cremora in it.
2,This is not Cappuccino,"Although this is a good coffee, I was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino. This coffee tastes nothing like it, it doesn't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests. If you want regular coffee, then this is the coffee to buy, but if you're looking for cappuccino, save your money."
4,What's Cappucino got to do with it?,"I'm not sure what cappucino has to do with this product -- It no more makes a cup of cappucino that Lipton cup-a-soup does. But -- the coffee it makes is very nice. Smooth, not overwhelmed by flavorings -- just a 7.5oz cup of reasonable strength. (Though it is better at the 5.5oz setting on Keurig coffee makers.) Nice with lots of milk."
2,you get what you pay for,"Tried to save money by purchasing this griddle. Can't say I'm surprised but it doesn't heat evenly at all. Someday I'll learn. It will go on my ""giveaway"" pile and will now look for something of quality."
3,The Book of Rock Stars,"As a fan of Krull's phenomenal mini-biography series, I was delighted when I discovered she had written a book about rock stars. I sought the book from my local library immediately, and was disappointed.For starters, the book's illustrations are a different style. They are funky, but don't represent the singers very well. I miss the caricatures that filled Krull's ""Lives of the..."" series. These pictures are more of an abstract mosaic of relevant (or irrelevant) images.Secondly, I noticed several simple errors in the book's spelling and language structure.The last annoyance is the fact that the book is just so darn short. Each biography- excluding that of the Beatles- is only a page long and sticks to the most basic facts about the singers', their bands, and most famous songs.This book is a good introduction to rock music for younger children. If you're looking for a comprehensive rock history, I highly recommend ""Rock & Roll Year by Year"" by Luke Crampton and Dafydd Rees."
4,Great gift for my 14 year old grandson who plays guitar,"It is very difficult to buy a gift for my grandson who just turned 14 this month....of course, money is always the perfect gift with a gift certificate to Best Buy or somewhere similar being right up there. But, I do like to come up with something to add to that so he'll have something to actually keep. I felt this book was perfect for him. His Dad plays the bass guitar and I thought he would enjoy reading it as well and the two could discuss it together. I actually read a couple of the rock star ""bios"" myself and thought it was something he would enjoy at his age...not too long, just right and he could read through quickly and even re-read and learn something about them he may have not known before."
4,SPENSER NOVEL 25,"The twenty fifth book in the Boston PI Spenser series by Robert B. Parker, WALKING SHADOW, is a typical Spenser book. Spenser's love Susan Silverman, wonderdful character as always, gets him involve with mayhem in Port City. Spenser is up against tough odds and not only need Hawk but Vinnie Morris another very tough Boston guy. Then we throw in Mei Ling a cool under fire student interrupter and the stage is set. Not my favorite Spenser but a very good one. As always the great Parker wit and dialogue, tough to beat RECOMMENDED."
3,Walking Shadow,"Chinatown & stage actors in a waterfront town. So-so plot. Entertaining repartee, characteristic of Parker."
4,Uses a few grey cells...,"This Spenser novel is just enough of a puzzler to exercise your mind. Former stories in the series have looked at the mindset of the ghetto gangs along with the more organized crime sydicates. This one takes a hard look at the Chinese connection. Parker as always successfully stays clear of stereotyped characters. And as always, there's always a bit of sympathy...maybe empathy is a better word...for even the least likeable characters.Also, there is always the look at ethics and morality. At the end of the book, you might well be asking yourself which character was the true villain or villainess of the piece."
3,"Great story, great setting, so-so characters","Let me state it clearly upfront -- I love Spenser. I also hold Hawk in high esteem. And Pearl never fails to charm me. I always consider time spent with these characters time well spent. I enjoyed the twists this plot took me on and appreciated that Spenser and Parker both respected the Asian/American community depicted here. HOWEVER, most of the female characters in this book were more than a little hard to like. Susan seems almost oblivious to the danger she perpetually puts her lover in. And, while I don't want to give too much of the plot away, let's just say that a lot of the story hinges on the selfish, shallow motives of women, as well. The misogyny of this work almost gave me the creeps. Of the new characters, DeSpain is the most intriguing."
3,Disappointing,Not One of Parker's best efforts. A light plot that he tries to wrap with a bunch of danger that is sort of light as well.
4,book fan,"Story line was o.k., but the characters were awesome. Parker does a great job with his usualy characters and describes the new ones very well, I can almost picture them in my own mind. I am a huge fan of Parker so I always enjoy his work, although this story line was a little weak. I enjoyed the twists and turns it take and that's what kept my so engaged."
5,Another Great One!!,"Parker is back and Spenser and company are kicking ass!! Love it! Great story, great ending!! Highly recommended!!"
2,Who's Rudnicki?,"I love the Spenser series, I've just started reading/listening to them. The best audio book so far is ""Small Vices"" read by Burt Reynolds. I've decided that the successs of the Spenser audio books depends on who's recording them, because the guy who reads this latest one (""Walking Shadow"") in a word - STINKS!!!! His last name's Rudnicki and he sounds like a 12 year old, not at all like the tough but lovable detective we all know, not believable at all! Thank God I already love these stories, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars - otherwise it would've been 1 star. Don't waste your money, read the book instead."
2,The audio book reader,"The reader for this audio book was terrible, Stefan Rudnicki. He read either too loud or in a whisper where you couldn't hear at all. You could not tell who was talking half the time, whether it be female or male. The story was good I enjoyed it, so don't get an audio read the book, I think you will enjoy it more."
2,The Audio Book reader is terrible,"The narrator for the audio book, Dan Parker, is torture on the ears. He has a very distracting lisp. The plot is fine, but read the book, don't get the audiotape!"
4,"Good book, terrible reader","I concur with the comments of the previous reviewers about the quality of the audiobook presentation by Daniel Parker. The Spenser books are made for drive-time listening, but one wonders whether anyone at Dove actually ever listened to Daniel Parker's performance before releasing it. There was a significant disconnect between my mind's-eye image of Spenser (tough, laconic big guy with insight and intelligence) and Parker's high-pitched lisp. Imagine a not-quite Charles Nelson Reilly voice emanating from Spenser and you get the picture.The best Spenser voice: Burt Reynolds, who does all the characters (including Hawk) extremely well. After Burt, Joe Mantegna is very good, and David Duke is OK."
3,Good Spenser novel,"Robert Parker books are always a good read. Quick, snappy and entertaining, I enjoy them immensely and Walking Shadow is no exception. The book opens with Spenser and Susan, his girlfriend, attending a play in a nearby small coastal town where Susan is on the board of directors. During the performance an actor is shot and killed on stage. Hawk and Vinnie are enlisted to help Spenser find the killer. During their investigation, they discover the small town is not as placid as it seems and the rest of the story is vintage Robert Parker with a few unexpected twists and turns.I love Spenser novels for their humor and integrity; Spenser and Hawk always win, good triumphs over evil, Spenser is always faithful to Susan and Pearl the dog is always the darling."
2,Not well done.,"If you've played guitar for awhile this is probably not the book you're looking for. Most of music transcibed in this book is the single string melody of the vocal line, not the guitar riffs from the song. Might be more interesting to a new musician, as beginners can pick out the vocal melody easier, but rather frustrating when you want something a little more challenging."
3,Wasn't exactly as I expected,"Not exactly what I expected. Soundwise some of the songs aren't close to the original. There are a number of songs that it is apparent that the editor took some poetic license in redefining ""easy."" All in all, I rate the book as average in being easy and in song quality."
1,You probably don't want this book,"This book contains simple, easy to play melodies that sound somewhat like the song, but are not at all true to the music. This book is made for someone who has never played the guitar before. The whole series of ""easy to play"" books are patronizingly simple versions of the real songs. I bought this book with a couple others just like it and tried to return them, but they only gave me about 1/5 of my money back. Basically I lost 30 bucks and received nothing for it. Amazon charged me $12 to have this single book ""reshelved."" What a joke."
1,SONGS ARE NOT IN CORRECT KEYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GUITAR PLAYING DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!. Almost ALL of the songs are in incorrect keys! ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" starting with a e5- NO NO NO. If you are serious about guitar playing this book will severly hamper you- I am afraid some young guitarists will buy it and trying listening to the songs and play along and wonder why they don't sound like the record. Its because this book was hacked to gather and you are not playing ANY of the same chords as the recording. The only good this book would be good for is if you want to ""kind of"" know some popular songs to play for your friends."
4,Works good.,I used this to install a Pioneer AVIC Z2 in my 2007 Honda Element SC. It works just like it is suppose to.
4,Great customer service. Great product. But...,I order one of these and it never showed. I emailed customer service and they immediately shipped another one. The description says 2005 and up but it doesn't fit on my 2012 civic. If the relabeled the product it would be perfect
5,Exact Fit for Honda Pilot 2006 EX-L,Exact adapter I needed to connect Pyle Audio head unit to the antenna in my Honda Pilot 2006 EX-L. Just connect blue to the Powered Antenna connector from the head unit and it works.
3,Good equipment,This was the right piece for my needs and it worked great. You guys continue to do right by me.
4,Worth it,"This is my favorite post Jerry Dead related offering, at least as far as commercial releases go. Phil, Steve Kimock, and Jorma, you just can't go wrong with that combo. There are some very uplifting musical moments here. Unless you're a big fan of Jorma you probably won't find the vocals to be very inspiring but to my ears they are not a distraction. The music here is good on its own merits but if you're expecting to hear the Grateful Dead, you might want to look elsewhere."
2,Huh?,"With this album I find two problems, 1 his name is not Phil Lish, 2 is the music. Utter disapointment came to me when I listened to the sample of Dupree's. Why on earth did lesh sing a whole bunch of Jerry's songs. Their voices are so different. I was hoping that it would entail some of what came from Mars hotel like Cucamunga and Unbroken Chain. Maybe I concentrate more on vocals then I should, it sounds like easy listening music rather than a trippy voyage in which Lesh was once so capable of and probably still is. The first dead song that I heard the dead do and that I liked was Unbroken Chain. The Grateful Dead has come and gone. It faded in and faded out. Members of the Grateful Dead should not try to make a new Grateful Dead for it is impossible. Their creativity has run dry. What does this have to do with this album? All the songs fell drastically short of the real thing."
2,Dingles for Jingles,"I was listening to this ""music"" whilst I cooked the ham. My gatorade spilled on my cheese and I ate the silly peanut butter. When I finished the cd, I heard god's voice, and he said to me ""bite the molar and chew your food."" and my life goes accordingly, to the ebbing and flowing of the cheese wiz, which ever so much flows through my endless cavity and chasm that is my lack of musical appreciation. Chew my spirit and gergil my noun. No predicate to follow, and no torque to be found. Chill out on a frosty GB blerg, and gnaw at the mind of Phil Lesh, for he is so happy in his galavanting that I can only imagine his frame of game. Silly music...made me scream."
2,Not All I Thought It Would Be,"I made the mistake of ording this book and Lee Frost's Complete Guide to Night and Low Light Photography at the same time. They are very similar books, but Frost's is better. (I gave it a 3.)Whereas Frost's book is fairly balanced between landscape (sun afterglow, moon light) and city/building shots, this one is heavily weighted toward the city. (From the photos, I can't confirm that Carucci has ever stepped off pavement.) I guess if your specific interest is low light city work, you might prefer this one. Same thing if you're very interested in slow-sync flash and other flash techniques. Otherwise, both books remain a bit weak on technical substance. (The brief twilight section in Zucherman's Natural Light Photography gives you about 30% of what you get here.)"
5,My wife and I fight over these bowls...,"Perfect size for cereal in the morning. We put a set in our RV and the rest are in the kitchen. Well made, dishwasher safe, perfect.Edit: Now a few years later, these are still some of our favorite bowls. Used one this morning actually. Ordering a second set because we use them so often."
2,"Yellow bowls are developing cracks, the blue ones are still fine","We ordered 2 sets of these bowls (Lemon and Blue). The yellow bowls have begun to develop cracks after just 2 months of use. The blue ones which are used just as frequently and cared for in the same manner, are fine. The bowls are a nice size and good to use with kids. It's just strange that the bowls of one color are cracking while the bowls of the other color are fine. I would give the blue bowls 4 stars and the yellow bowls zero stars."
2,Don't buy them!,"I gave a two star only because of their durability and the fact that ice cream melts very slowly in them. BUT they say they are dishwasher top shelf safe. That is incorrect. They shiny top coat comes off in patches. Since the return policy said ""in the condition they were received"" I didn't want to bother with that hastle. I ended up using a black permanent maker on the outside to even the look out but the inside still looks bad. Don't buy them if you are going to clean them in a dishwasher. Oh, you cannot use them in the microwave either."
5,nice bowls,I like light-weight plastic bowls for cold foods and snacks. Its not easy to find! I ordered these bowls in lime green and its a fun color. Great price for 6 bowls. I washed them in the dish washer top rack and so far no problems. They are labeled made in China and I wasn't really sure if I wanted to eat from a colored bowl but I think for wrapped chocolates & some chips its ok. I wont eat any hot foods from these bowls though.
3,Reston lloyd azure bowl,I was dissappointed as soon as I got the bowls out of the box and saw the no microwave sticker on the bottom. Though they basically do what I wanted them to do after only a few months they are starting to show signs of wear and tear. I even hand wash them most of the time to save them from the harshness of the dishwasher.
3,bowls,"durable and cheap, but when it says not microwave safe i know why! I accidentally put on it and it was burning hot. so good if you have the food hot and ready to eat, but avoid the microwave with them"
1,Three of six arrived damaged,"Terrible damaged, not just scratched, but actually in pieces. Even packaged decently, three of the bowls were in pieces or split open. Not durable obviously."
3,Not what I was expecting.,"I bought these for a gift, and I was slightly embarassed by th gift. Just not what I was expecting."
2,melamime bowls,"the bowls arrived broken. and beside that, they are plastic. I did not know that. I thought melamime was part of the name. upon further scrutiny of the item specifics, it does indeed say they are made of ""sturdy melamime. it should clarify that they are plastic!!I should not be expected to know the chemical breakdown of different types of plastic to have been able to identify ""melamime!! 3$ per plastic bowl that I can purchase in the dollar store or walmart. :("
4,Great Bowls -- Durable,"I've had these bowls for a year, and I really love them. I love the green color, which is still vibrant after a year use, and the depth is great for cereal, salad, soup, etc. I have forgotten a few times and put in the microwave just to heat up leftovers == less than two minutes. Nothing horrible happened, but since they are advertised as not microwave safe, I try not to do this. Still I end up using the bowls for many things. Totally dishwasher safe."
2,"low quality, don't buy","the green ones are fine but the blue ones have broken apart and gotten grainy inside, and soap won't wash out of them now"
2,Tiny,These were tiny- ordered by mistake on my part. I don't like plastic - ended up giving them away.
1,Fit for a camel,"Model 21 False Eyelashes No. 08, 10 PairsThe way they were packaged left all of the lashes smashed flat, with no curve at all. The would have looked good on a camel.Certainly not a human."
4,Could triple the price if....,"only there was a song about listening to Mom and Dad. Otherwise, this video is everything the other reviews state: catchy songs and great messages. The day my 2 1/2 year old watched it, she started applying what she learned, it was a beautiful thing."
3,Keep it simple,Barney is a wonderful character. I only wish there were less people and more speaking from Barney. Definitely not for children under the age of 2. Too much going on and to many background distractions.
1,Acting Out Bad Manners & Making It Funny? Not Good!!,"This video has the characters acting out bad manners at the dinner table and they do it in a way that will have your kid laughing, then afterwards it shows good manners, but to make the bad manners funny defeats the purpose, your kids may end up picking up some more bad manners they didn't know yet and think it's funny. Not a good movie in my opinion, i'd recommend going with the Dora Manners Movie instead."
2,2 Years,"I can honestly not give it a rate at this time (I guess I have too)my daughter is only 2 years old and she juststarted to be a little afraid of person with Mask.And there is a part in the movie where the childrenare dressed up with mask, and she asks meto take it off.But keep in mind BARNEY in general is avery educational and entertaining movie for the kids."
2,My 16 months old doesn't like it much,"Probably she's still too little to enjoy it, but this one doesn't make her sit still for long, compared to ABCs and Numbers DVDs. Hopefully, that'll change when she gets older."
3,This voice has to go...,My 2 year old loves the story. Great songs to keep her in a trance!!! Although the voice is something we cannot get past...I am online now looking for older videos with the old voice!!!
1,Really Creepy,"I'm surprised this game got as good of a rating as it did. This game actually really creeped me out. I know it's ""haunted"" holiday, but I found it more a creepy kind of creepy than a fun kind of creepy. The areas are creepy, the music is creepy. But, if you like things like that, you might like this game, but I didn't. I also don't like that you can't save, so you're stuck playing for hours if you want to beat it. I do like that the backgrounds change, so it doesn't always look the same. There were some fun things, but mostly, I didn't like this game."
1,Not Happy,"Return policy is terrible...they do not have one. Costume was defective. Item said to be new was obviously used, packaging was old. Had Ruby's costumes stamped on packaging. I will not purchase from this vendor or Ruby's in the future."
4,Great product,Using this with Flexicose has made a HUGE difference for our Golden. He will be 12 in August and is still playful.
5,Perfect compact office tool,"I really like the stapler, it is strong metal and durable and it works great. After 500 staples not one staple jam, it is just a bit smaller than it is pictured. Unlike another review, this stapler works just like any other stapler."
4,Very Good Overall,"Small enough to easily fit on a desk, but sizable enough to do a professional job consistently, does not frequently jam like the small dollar-store variety does so often."
3,Don't use the staples that come with the item,"The stapler is small. Attempting to use the staples that were packaged with the stapler, I could seldom staple successfully. Staple would often jam, or else wouldn't completely close. If those were the only staples available, I would be pressed to give this even one star. I happened to have a box of EXP40022 standard staples, so I tried those. So far the stapler has worked just fine. If stapler were of a standard office size I would give it more stars, but it is a bit awkward with its small size. For occasional use with a few sheets AND a good quality staple, I'm happy with the item."
1,Not recommended,"Ordered for use at the library I work at, because it looked like it would be more reliable than the plastic ones. It jams all the time and breaks easily. Do not recommend, especially for high-frequency use."
1,No fit,"I brought this stater sometime ago like last year knowing that I would eventually need another one because the old one was an use part; well I do need one as this moment but this one isn't it. The holes that are use for bolting the thing on are to small in width. I was under the impression that the product fit because of the information Amazon provided, now I fear the to return this item for another one that actually lines up with the bolt holes may turn out to be a run around. I hope not but thats wha I get for buying early and trusting something that i can physically touch for the answers."
5,As good as the rest...,I have been hooked on Brian Lumley's Necroscope since his first book in the series way back when. This book does not disappoint.
5,BASED ON A TRUE STORY!!!!,I just found out that the husband who pretended to commit suicide in this movie..and then moved to a new city to start a new family actually lives in my city! The real woman who this is movie is based on was just interviewed on 48 hours. Although the news story I saw was only a short segment..this was a full-length movie on this lady's life and....WOW...what she had to go through! This is a great movie if you feel like becoming totally involved in a really enjoyable drama.
4,movie,pretty good movie sorry but ni do not like to do reviews as i don't like being told how many words are needed
5,Excellent,"I have not got to actually view this DVD yet, but sure it's ok. One of my favorite Lifetime movies and thank you for the great price on it!!"
5,Well Worth It,House MD is a wonderful season to watch and it is even better to be able to watch it at your own pace!! Would highly reccomend this show.
5,...and the show goes on,"I was happy my wife ""turned me on"" to this show. It is a great deal of fun to watch. The only problem I have with the show is Dr. House always has his subordinates perform procedures that in a real hospital environment would be done by others. I am an X-ray/CT technician. I have been working in this capactiy for over 3 years and never has a doctor come into my deparment to do one of the studies I am trained and paid to do. But I understand that this it T.V. so they cut corners for entertainment purposes. I truly enjoy when House has to deal with patients who come in for problems that are a result of their own idiocy. He explains to them in no uncertain terms just how stupid they are and why they have the problem they do. I frequently deal with people like this. But not being a Doctor on T.V. I politely answer the questions to the best of my ability, do the requested exams and go about my merry way. I look forward to the next season."
5,Good stuff!,"If you've ever watched House or even if you haven't and are just looking for a good medical drama that will capture you and hold you, this is it. Season 2 was excellent and even better in HD!"
4,Very Pleased,"The only worry I had was the packaging - it didn't come with any special wrapping that would prevent damage, but it DID arrive in perfect condition. I would order from this company again."
4,House !!,So good - I can't wait for the current season to cme out on DVD.House is a great mix of drama + comedy - thanks to Hugh Laurie + cast.I gave the dvd 4 stars due to the lack of notes about the episodes that season 1 had.
5,House,"This made a great birthday gift for my brother, who really loves the show. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I'm also a fan of the show, and have seen most all the episodes. Most audiences will be entertained by this even if you don't like Dr. House's demeanor."
4,Can't wait for series three,"I found the series extremely entertaining, with some misgivings about the direction the development of the character Dr House was taking, but by the end of the series all had been made good, if not better than expected. A fantastic enthralling series, with humour, drama, emotions...I have recommended it to me friends as I do to you."
4,House Rules,"Other than a broken piece of plastic which causes disc 5 to fly everywhere, I can't complain."
5,As good as season 1 if not better!,Was absolutely hooked to the show; watched all episodes in season 2 within 2 days. Definitely worth having the DVD.
3,Some good extras this time?,"The Season 1 DVD boxset was rather rushed into production for an early release before the Season 2 premiere and hence was not in widescreen, as planned, was on double-sided discs and the extras were a bit on the paltry side. This time, with a bit more time on their hands, it looks like TPTB have taken the fans' criticisms into account. No news on the widescreen issue but early reports indicate that the Season 2 DVDs will be single-sided and feature the following extras:""An Evening With 'House'""; Alternate Takes; ""It Could Be Lupus""; ""No Reason"" Commentary, Audio Commentary, Documentary, Featurette, Gag ReelAside from the fact that I'd be buying it anyway, it's gotta be worth getting just for the prospect of a House gag reel!! :D"
5,Season Two is Great,"Season two of house is my favorite season. I have seen every show thus far. The story lines are great. House is just House, and anyone who watchs House knows what I mean. House is the only show on TV that I watch. My whole family loves watching House."
5,"Good solid entertainment,...without the commercials.","First rate product. One of the best programs to come around in years.I have watched this program on tv with commercials, but nothing beats watching any episode, anytime, without them.Would recommend to anyone."
5,House Season 2,The wonderful dry humor and medical mysteries continue with Dr. House and his team. Not one episode should be missed.
2,House is Wonderful,"If you enjoy watching House, you will enjoy having the entire Season II at your disposal anytime you desire. How wonderful it is to watch without being bombarded by commercials."
5,No problems!,"The DVDs shipped out right away and are in great condition. No complaints, I'm glad I ordered them used ! Definitely would order from them again."
5,Excelente serie,"Me parece muy interesante y atarctiva la serie, que se aparta de las series del mismo tipo, donde se va mucho mas alla de ver como es el trabajo medico, sino que se involucra en el caracter heterogeneo de cada personaje y su interrelacion entre si. Sobre todo destaco la fugura o personaje de House, encuentro que la interpretacion del medico intolerante, soes, irrespetuoso, ateo, brillante como medico, pero sobre todo humano (bajo su forma de ver las cosas), es simplemente genial. Por supuesto que el resto del elenco tambien desarrolla una excelente interpretacion. Lejos lo mejo que he visto en series de TV de este tipo."
5,daughter is enjoying,My daughter was going to school in England and when she returned she wanted to watch this series. I bought the first 2 seasons and will have to buy more.
5,Even Better Than The First,"i love tv shows but one thing that always bothered me was the fact that many had a terrific season one and the others were only good. I'm glad that House is not the case, i loved the first season, smart and funny at the same time and i didn't thought they could do twice, but they did! great season two!The season finale was mind-blowing, the writters are insane smart.highly recommended.Favorites Episodes01 - Acceptance02 - Autopsy08 - The Mistake13 - Skin Deep17 - All In20 - Euphoria (1)21 - Euphoria (2)21 - No Reason"
4,Bizarre and funny,"Bizarre cases but interesting and funny. If you have medical interests, you should get it."
5,House was Great!,The DVD was excellent! Since I love House it would be difficult to say anything else. The shpping time was great and of course the price was right. Worth every cent!
5,The Best Show and Best Actor on Television.,"Season one was phenomenal, Season two was phenomenal and Season three is turning out to be incredibly phenomenal. What more can I say? I've never been more hooked on a show in my life and plan to buy every season on DVD. I already have Seasons 1 and 2. This show is a definite winner and Hugh Laurie is the best!"
5,"Another House , MD obsessE","As a RN who caught on to this mid first season of show, I can tell you that I am completely obessed with the characters, premise of the medical 'who done it' and of course with the heartstopping Hugh Laurie. This is thought provoking, ethical stretching (I hide my face or scream at House to stop doing what he's doing) and medically challenging. Favorite episodes? ""Autopsy"" is heartbreaking with pediatric girl and House' response. ""Daddy's Boy"" is an opening into his relationship with his parents that leaves you wanting more to reveal his damaged emotional background. ""House vs God"" has deep theological vs scientific debate which is a great spin on this controversy. ""Euphoria"" lets Omarr Epps shine - also great insight into this character's makeup. Cliffhanger ""No Reason"" was so well written with its plot twists and viewpoint - gotta get this Season to appreciate ensemble, awe of the medicine and again the charm/craziness of ""House""."
5,House on DVD,"Besides ER is is the greatest television show on the tube,you can watch them over and over again and never get tired of it.I am looking forward to many more episodesThanks Alisha Berding."
4,House,The DVD's smelled like smoke and I would have liked to have some indication that was going to happen. It's really not my favorite smell. Other wise the DVD's ran great and they came within a week.
5,Excellent,"This is a highly readable version of the Babylonian epic Gilgamesh. Mitchell has translated the original into free-flowing, vivid verse. Because the poem has come to us in fragments, any translation is also a reconstruction. While only a scholar in this area can be sure, Mitchell's version seems appropriately close to the original. The story of Gilgamesh is the eternal story of the human confrontation with the reality of inevitable mortality. Accompanying the text of the poem is a nice introduction about the poem and its theme. There are fine Notes in which Mitchell lays out his choices for translation and a short but adequate bibliography. As a final bonus, this is a very handsomely produced book. My only complaint is that the notes are not cited in the text of the poem."
4,An excellent introduction to a classic tale.,"Your take on this version of Gilgamesh will likely depend on your scholarly intimacy with earlier renditions of the text. Mitchell has done a wonderful job of bringing the text to life for the modern reader in smooth, flowing language without losing any of the grandeur of prior translations. Mitchell is careful in his introduction to alert the reader that this is a ""version"" rather than a ""translation"", and he freely admits that he takes a bit more literary license than a verbatim translation would permit. Readers with a more scholarly interest in this work may be put off by that, but for those looking for an introduction to Gilgamesh, this is an excellent choice."
5,An amazing experience,"Gilgamesh delivers a truly amazing experience. You read this story and you think your reading a modern epic and then you remember that this is one of the oldest recorded stories and it is even more amazing. The way the story is told and weaved gives the characters a larger than life feel. It truly is the icon of epics. Gilgamesh has real emotions that we all feel and can identify with even though this story may seem over the top to some. The style is different from our modern ways of storytelling, which in the end only adds to the greatness of this story. By the end you really feel with the characters and grow with them. The end of the book is superb and is worth reading just for the last few sentences. All in all a must have for anyone who loves a good story."
3,"Readable -Yes, Authentic - ?","Gilgamesh is widely considered to be one oldest and most important surviving literary works of the ancient world. Wilson's version is not derived from original texts, but, based an amalgam of translations and the writer's own thoughts. While these liberties make for a smooth and accessible text they may necessitate the serious reader to look at a more academic version.I found Mitchell's version readable and enjoyable. I am not a Gilgamesh scholar and am unable to comment of his faithfulness to the original text. The tone of his introductory comments (a politically correct new age feel, however, raise questions in my mind and has caused me to seek out a different version/translation.Overall, Mitchell breathes life into this ancient classic; however, I have concerns that he may have taken some liberties."
2,Don't be confused,"If you are reading this book just don't think you are reading the Sumerian story of Gilgamesh and you'll be fine. This is a modern revery loosely tricked out in Gilgamesh's garments. To say it ""takes liberties with the original"" is like saying the 1960s folk-rock song ""Turn, Turn, Turn"" took liberties with the book of Ecclesiastes. As long as you have that straight and you don't credit yourself with a serious engagement with serious ancient literature, have at it. You'll even enjoy a few half-pages.--Z"
2,Gilgamesh for dummies,"This is not a translation, as other reviewers have designated it. It is a ""version"", that is, a retelling based on the translations of others. It is overly sugary and cute. Passages from the original are reordered or omitted, while new passages are invented. This ""version"" doesn't hold a candle to Foster's genuine translation."
4,A terrific translation,"It was not without some concern that I got this book as part of the course work for a Classical Mythology program at my local university. It was a welcome surprise, then, when it turned out to be a highly readable re-telling of the ancient Gilgamesh story in modern English. It was so readable, in fact, that I would recommend it be read for pleasure."
3,Interesting but long,"For someone who's never read or listened to Gilgamesh before, this may seem to be overdramatic and long-winded with the repetitive phrases and dramatized language. Therefore I would advise to take it slow and listen to the book in parts, maybe even chapters to digest it better. The Sumerian Odyssey, it's a highly complex and interesting read that one may need some background in certain words and god-myth, but overall anyone can understand. The adventures and characters are colourful, exciting, and relate with people today, thousands of years later by connecting through common human emotions and experiences. There's even a flood story in there that's remarkably close to the Christian Noah and the Ark. Overall, a read that is worth it's weight, though not a feat to be undertaken by the impatient."
3,Epic of Gilga-mess,"If you enjoy well-translated poetry, read the first few pages of Mitchell's translation before you buy this book. What you may find is that this version reads like a translation of a poem that is ten years old, at the most.Mitchell's writing seems to have no poetic vigor that is characteristic of many other translations of Gilgamesh - or similar works for the matter. Reading this version is like looking at a wooden miniature, carved with an axe - it's coarse and unrefined. Annoyances range from his use of rather odd, modernistic similes, to his usage of miles instead of cubits, and my biggest pet peeve - removal of long, word-for-word-similar passages in some parts, while preserving those in others.If you're anything more than a casual reader, I strongly recommend another translation. Mitchell's version is inconsistent and crude, at best."
1,Lessons Learned,"Gilgamesh is an epic tale that demonstrates, even though the story is thousands of years old, several lessons that can easily be applied to life in current times. Like Gilgamesh we all face challenges as he did in this story; an example of some of the lessons that he overcame that can be applied to our own realities would be Gilgamesh overcoming Enkidu's challege for his throne, Enkidu was as big and strong but Gilgamesh took on the challenge and ended up not just winning the battle but also he gained a new best friend. As their relationship grew so did their confidence in eachother and soon they decided to travel on a mission to kill the tremendous monster of the pine forest. The heroes set out on this journey with an intent to increase their power an infulence over their region of the world, but in the end they do far more than they ever imagined, learning that nothing ever last forever and that surrenders must be made in order for wisdom and happiness to prevail."
2,not impressed,"I wish I had known this was not an accurate translation. I found it juvenile and redundant where the text was made up. Not a good read, rather boring!!"
3,"Not a translation but a ""version""","I made the considerable error of reading the introduction first. This lenghty and tiresome opinion piece quoted from his version of this epic poem liberally. In fact so liberally, that I almost lost interest in reading the poem itself. When I finally summoned up enough courage to read it after being bored to death by the introduction, I found a poem deviod of music or elegance. His use of modernisms reminds one of the differences between reading the King James version of the Bible and many of the modern translations. Finally, it should be pointed out (as the author does) that this is not a new translation but a ""version"" cobbled together from other author's works. Skip this one and read one of the more classic true translations."
2,Could be much better,"The writing of this version is good but I feel it goes too off topic. It brings up Yahweh, Exodus, bunch of bible stuff. I bought the book to read Gilgamesh, not some watered down version with commentary up the wazoo. So far the best version I have seen is the Verse Narrative version by Herbert Mason, check that one out."
4,"Translation's a little loose, but otherwise great","Since there were apparently no scholarly translations at my local library, this and the Penguis Classics version were the only ones I could find. Overall, I like this one better; Mitchell does a great job of making it an classic English-language work in and of itself. The translation is still a bit loose for my tastes however, and I don't exactly appreciate it when he adds things to the poem that weren't there in the first place."
3,An old epic,"Gilgamesh being one of the oldest epics known to man has been read by many. One could find parts of this story in every day movies here in the twenty-first century. This story is pretty basic having the same plot line as others. It has its introduction, its climax, and so on. It does not have that complex English, like other ancient epics, so it should not be too hard to follow. It is not that long of a book either. Book I jumps right into the story with Enkidu and then all of a sudden, a sex scene for seven days. But then later in the book there are challenges and a beast that Gilgamesh and Enkidu have to fight. So this story has its action and drama, but one is not on the edge of its seat for the whole thing. It has a good story to it, especially for how old it is. Its an interesting story and would be a descent one to read with ones spare time."
4,Lots of Fun for the Uninitiated,"Great epic, enthralling version told with color and great introduction"
3,Another Epic Hero,"As Odysseus had his hubris, Achilles' his slave-girl issues, Aeneas his abandonment of various women, and Beowulf his greed in the end, Gilgamesh is a non-traditional hero whose sin is the all-too human desire for immortality, both through fame and life everlasting. While only 1/3rd man, Gilgamesh comes through as a more human hero than any of the later civilizations, whose downfalls are man's own.Still, while a nice translation and a decent story, I wouldn't read it unless required to do so."
4,"The first story ever told. Frankly, not much has changed.","It's basically the oldest recorded story of any kind, and that gives it a weird sort of prominence. Gilgamesh feels like a prototype of Achilles in a lot of ways. The ultimate, hubristic badass, caught up in a quest for masculine honor which eventually breaks and humbles him after he looses his closest friend. Physical strength and sexual prowess are the end-all-be-all of these people's lives. Yet there is also this incredibly dark, world-weary sensibility at play: no matter how many monsters they kill or seven day sexual marathons they participate in, death is going to get them in the end, and they sure can't seem to forget it. It doesn't have the consistently beautiful writing of later epics, but at times it's actually pretty poignant, especially towards the end when things start to get really sad and brooding. Goes to show you, civilization was old before it was ever young."
5,In awe,This is the best work Marc has done in my opinion and I have everything he has done. It is so sad that he never got to hear the finished product himself before leaving us. Your music will forever be our gift from you Marc and we thank you and will miss you beyond expression.
3,a good one for WOV fans,"There're some great guitar hooks on this record but Marc's not a great singer in the performance sense. He's got kind of a wooden, Lou Reed-circa 1990 sound, coming across as unsure of his voice, like there's been no live performances or tours to help round out his delivery and the songs themselves, which sound studio-built, or like 4-track experiements.Betty Davis Eyes cover doesn't add much though starts out promising.Still, there's a low-fi heart to this that's more riveting and sincere than anything Stan Ridgeway's done in 10 years."
2,This is not how I want to remember Marc,"Marc Moreland was the primary musical genius behind Wall of Voodoo. Unfortunately, that genius is heard only here or there on this disc. Listen to Wall of Voodoo's self titled EP, Call of the West, Dark Continent, Seven Days in Sammmy's Town or the Department of Crooks album for a much better listening experience. Like Robin Trower, Steve Hackett, and Steve Howe before him, Marc should never have sung on his own album. Secondly, the songs aren't that good either. You don't have to be a great singer to perform rock, but should be adequate at least. Bringing in a singer or recording an album of instrumentals would have made a much better recording."
2,Mortal Kombat,"Mortal Kombat was really weak on the SNES because it was so censored. No blood, some people had different fatalities (ex: Johnny Cage's foot in your stomach). Blood was traded for sweat (?!?!) and because of those 2 reasons, the game was truly brought down a notch.Yes it's still a classic but it's not worth it on SNES. You're better off getting it on the SEGA system because that way you could overcome the censorship and at least put in a ""blood code"".Personally, I'd skip this one anyday and go straight to MK II because that was just all out better than MK and it was a lot more enjoyable, had better replay and a lot more characters. Trust me, skip MK on SNES and go straight for MK II on SNES."
2,Do you have some Jack Daniels and a bunch of honey BBQ wings?!,"Because you need something like that to make this game interesting and enjoyable; because its that bad!!!!!!!!!!Seriously this game sucks, the graphics were great for the 16-BIT, the sound isn't all that bad, and that's were it stops. The gameplay is full of glitches and other issues. There is no blood, though you'll see a lot of sweat, maybe some tears, but no blood. You can't leave that out of the deal, also the game was just censored to death. The combination of the bad gameplay, and lack of originality that should have come from the arcades killed this version! I remember you could trip someone half way across the screen!? ;( Its just a dumb game.If you wanna make it good like I said in the begining get some beer and other things, possibly get drunk, and then maybe you might find it entertaining. Other than that avoid this one, but check out the sequel."
1,Smallest Frisbee,I ordered a couple of different frisbees on amazon hoping to find one that would stand up to my border collie. This is definately not the one. Do not buy this. I was completly shocked at the size. This is no more than 7 inches and my dog has already poked holes in this after 10 minutes of use. If I could give this a zero I would. DO NOT BUY- You will waste your money.
3,Good disc,"This is a great frisbee, however is a bit heavy for my pooch. I tend to like the cheapo ones you can get at pet supermarket because the are light and glide long enought for her to run and catch it before it hits the ground. If you need competition disc, then this listing is what you would need. If you tend to have your dog run a distance and then you throw it, this will work. Yet my pup likes to run after I throw it, which although she is fast, she rarely gets to it before it hits the ground.This is very durable and will last much longer than the cheap ones and if you have a really windy day, it would also fly a lot better than the flimsy one.All in all, it's well built, yet a bit to heavy for my taste. Hope this helps!"
5,Manual of Internal Fixation in the Cranio-Facial Skeleton,An extremely useful book that summarize the current methods recommended by A.O. on internal fixation of craniofacial skeleton.I think the first chapter on the basic concept and various methods of internal fixation is particularly well written and must be read.The schematic drawings for various fracture fixation give a strong visual impression on the fixation technique.Everybodies who are interested in craniofacial fixation should kept a copy for quick reference.
2,Under $20 and not going anywhere.,"After reviewing over half the stocks in this book, I found only two I would consider purchasing. Most have gone down or gone nowhere. I still enjoy Gene Walden's book ""The 100 Best Stocks to Own in America"" but this book did nothing for me. Also, was surprised he had so little technology stocks in the book."
4,Pretty Good,"This was in fact a gift, not for me but i ordered it. The person receiving the gift was pretty satisfied."
2,GTA VCS,"I had a problem receiving the game from Amazon. They delayed 1 day because UPS had problems identifing the adress! I think Amazon should review the way the summarize the adress.The game itself is not bad, but not worth the price! The first version GTA liberty city was great."
4,It's just amazing. period.,"This product is amazing. the graphics are phonominal, the sound quality is fantastic, and the game play is amazing! this game may get a little frustrating at times, but once you beat the game, it gets better. it's just full of excitement, and joy. My friend's step brother, (he's 6) he loves the game! even though it's for Mature audiences, i think hes mature enough to know that killing is bad. come on. who will do it? well, i rated it 4 stars because it gets boring after a while. so i hope you get it, and have fun!"
1,Awful game,This game was really bad graphics are very low quality and the game lags. If you are used to grandtheft auto then this will feel like an insult to the whole series
4,stats of gaming,graphic: the same as any other grand theft auto sucks but u dont care becouse the story is great.story: great and violentcontrols: if u cant figure them out then u havent played grand theft auto before
3,Where Did My Car Go???,"It's a fun game, nice to visit Vice City again. Getting used to the PSP controllers take a little bit of time. I was pleased with the music, (the selection for Liberty City Stories was just awful).I have not completed the game yet, but my biggest gripe is that in the first save house I keep losing my cars (wasn't that a problem they had corrected years ago in a different version???. A reall bummer considering I had the V8 muscle car... if it wasn't for that I'd have give the game 4 stars."
1,dont bother,"I have seen this DVD,and frankly it looks like a bad brochure.Wasted money if you buy it."
1,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"If you purchase this CD with the idea that you're going to get the exact sound of Johnny Cash singing Hank Williams you remember from the original recording, you will be disappointed. Although many rave about the remastering, the cutting of the background chorus and several musicians takes a heavy toll on the nostalgic value of the music. What you now get is the voice of Johnny Cash with minimal accompaniment--all well and good if pure vocal is your desire, but not so well and good if you want the original package."
4,Johnny Cash Sings some Hank Williams,"First of all: This is a cd of an original record. There has been made a lot of compilations of Johnny Cash music, but this one is not one of theme.That in mind it might not be so disappointing that only 6 of the 17 tracks are Hank Williams.I have been buying Cash cd's for a decade now but recently I found out that I wanted to buy all the original recordings on CD. So I bought this cd not because of the Hank Williams theme, but because I love Johnny Cash.Hank Williams was not an old man, but he wrote many of the best songs that has ever been written. In my opinion there are no better man to sing them then Johnny Cash.Then there are 9 Johnny Cash tunes on here as well and many of them was not familiar to me, but I really loved them.This is overall a great CD but not one of the best. Therefore 4 out of 5"
5,Masterful performance,"With the release of this CD, my good friend from NYC, Charles Blenzig, shows that he can handle, and perfectly execute any jazz band format and/or style.Following up after his wonderful Certain Standards piano trio, recorded with Kenny and Gene, this time it's Charles composing originals as well as arranging standards within a larger combo band with horns.His piano sounds ever so brilliant and even more mature than before. The compositions are clear, band is tight and crisp, and the arrangements are original.Charles' ""pianism"" is percussive, punctual, rich and seductive.The horn solos and arrangements are never ""overblown"", and the whole CD is well balanced and produced.Thanks Charles, a.k.a. ""Daddy-O"" for another beautiful CD...You rock, bro!With greatest respect,Lale Nenadovic"
4,NO MOUSER,"Davis does for raquetball what he did for wrestling in VISION QUEST. The raquetball court becomes the three dimensional metaphor for the complex obstacle that Bert Bowden must overcome if he is to get on with his life.Well-paced, with language that soars at times, IF ROCK N ROLL... places Davis in the upper echelon of adolescent fiction writers. The central images, the sleek powerful motorcycles, a child's terror and the athlete's development are so well-drawn that they will not let go of you easily."
4,wild guns,"This game is a lot of fun. It's old school arcade style gameplay where the only objective is to blast the bad guys. The difficulty is up there, but the game is never unfair. There is always a way out of every situation, it's just a matter of having the reflexes to dive out of the line of fire and the awareness to know that it's time to do so. It may not do anything new, but it does everything right and it all comes together perfectly. It's only real flaw is that it's short, and once you know the patterns you can get through it quickly, but it doesn't get any easier with repetition. It's hard to find, which means it can get pricey, but it doesn't disappoint."
5,Great Surprise,"I've listened to it twice and was surprised that I never heard of him before, will bein my repeat cd's."
4,very good book,"Overall this is a very good book on a topicthat is not well documented elsewhere. Well writtenand easy to read. Lots of diagrams showing codeflow which was very helpful for digesting theinformation. The only caveat is that this bookdoes not cover more recent 2.6 kernel (e.g. no discussionof NAPI). Such is the problem with linux books, bythe time these books are published the codehas changed significantly. Regardless this bookis still worth buying if you need to understandlinux network architecture and the source code."
1,zero stars,this game isn't even worth one star.how do you fight???even if your enemy's power bar is down you have to be in tip top shape when time runs out.
3,ICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game stinks!!!!!!!I think The pics. VIOLNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game should not be MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Cool watch but cant's see the face,"great looking watch online but when you get it it is hard to see the time, i thought it was the battery but the battery is fine it is hard to see the numbers because the digital part is metallic. so i dont recommend it it is to hard to see the numbers."
3,How to Build and Power Tune Holley Carbs,I was not impressed with this book.This is geared more for the expert than a novice.
2,Be aware of the agenda,"While this travel gudie does cover Iceland in detail, one needs to be careful to note that lonely planet does have their own agenda. Many of the hotels they reccommend over other establishments are not the best accomodations. Their may even be other hotels in the area where they say there are no other places to stay. And from a guide in the west fjords, some of their contact information as well as their descriptions may be far off."
5,Best birthing book BAR NONE,"I spent a year as an animal caretaker on a farm. There were about 15 sheep on the farm, but my duties were strictly limited to counting and first aid. Little did I know that those ewes had become pregnant. I was SOOOOOOOOO glad that the owners had this book at the house. It walked me through every step of everything I would need to know. Many people called me ""over-prepared,"" but when 4 of the 5 ewes needed help, I knew what to do or how to find it in the book. I have thought about going to the author's home and telling her how ""right on"" she was and that she pretty much saved my sanity and each of those baby lambs in one way or another. I even stumped some professional goat-breeding neighbors by knowing how to tube-feed a newborn with no suckle response.I would highly recommend this book to any novice or professional breeder. This book saved my sanity!"
4,Fun memories,"Sure this game is like Super Mario Kart, but I sure don't care. For anyone who liked Power Rangers growing up, this is a gem for you. Also, this is a underrated game to a underrated version of Power Rangers Zeo. I played this game once years ago, and forgotten it had existed. The control takes a while to get use to. The best drivers are Zeo Ranger 5 and the Gold Ranger. Personally, I also like the Green Ranger driver as well. A very underrated game indeed."
1,"No picture at all, not resolved through sharp.","I bought this TV on 10/9/06 and in 5/08, with the warranty expired, the TV began to lose the picture completely, no menus no picture. It did this periodically for short periods of time at first and now it spends the majority of the time just black with sound. I guess I will have to try to get it repaired but am pretty sure that I am just screwed. I purposely purchased this TV (which was more expensive than comparable sets) because of the superior picture quality and the EXPECTATION that it was of better quality than them, in other words as an investment. I am extremely disappointed and the company has pretty much responded to my call to them by saying, ""Tough break, try to fix it."" They have not responded to emails."
5,nice 32 inch lcd,"This is nice sized LCD for my smaller living room. Great picture quality, High definition broadcast over cable comes in great. DVDs play well. Big improvement of my previous analog tv set."
1,"Great idea, terrible implementation","In theory this is a great idea for anyone with straight bars like you'd find on most mountain bikes and some hybrids.In reality, these suck big time. The two main problems are that they're an extremely tight fit inside the bars, and the LEDs are very dim.Do not screw around with safety. Don't get these. They're a PITA and don't work."
5,Success!,"I had vowed to read the Bible through in a year, for many years, without success. When I discovered this simple, handy, inspired plan, over 10 years ago, I finally had the tool that would help me honor that vow. I have used it every year since, and have given it as gifts. I now can say I read the Bible through every year."
1,Not Compatible with QuickBooks as Claimed.,"My company purchased CountIt in the summer of 2007. Six months later, we have been unable to upload our inventory data to QuickBooks, a feature claimed to be available by Wasp. In our case, we use an inventory description field in QuickBooks that is approximately 20 characters in size. CountIt will only allow approximately 9 characters. Wasp's original response to our complaint was to tell us to truncate our product descriptions. That change is not possible. Since then, we have been on a 4 month trail of tears in which Wasp supplies us with a failed patch; we notify them of the failure; and then three weeks later, they send us another failed patch. Clearly, the product is not compatible with QB as claimed. And, in general, the customer service has been slow and unreliable."
5,Great game it should be ported to GBA,"This is one of the greatest fighting games ever. It has been a while since i have played it but I have it on my snes emulator. I hope Nintendo re releases this masterpiece of a game to the game boy advanced.Soon im getting a game boy advanced and it would be cool to play Killer Instinct werever I go, whenever I want. If you have not played this game I urge you to play it its a classic......Remember mister or misses I work for nintendo and Im reading this please put this on Game Boy Advanced."
5,KI is great,"This game started the world of fighting games, and is known as one of the classics. If you didn't have this game and still don't, buy it, and you won't regret. Lasts for hours and has many playable characters. One of my favorite games of all time!!"
4,A classic fighting game.,This is one of my favorite fight games of all time. I have just started playing it again and I still had remembered some of the cool combos. I still wanted to try KI Gold again though. I dont think I have gotten the hang of a few things.
3,ok- its snes whatcha expect,pretty good game but it goes from easy to very hard very fast... i do recomend getting it if you like to chill with friends and play multi-player when your bored.. dont get it if you just gonna be playing it by yourself it will get boring
5,One of the Best SNES Games,"This game was awesome for it's time. It was visually amazing, the sounds were sharp and realistic, and everyone was unique. If you used the cheat, you could unlock the two headed boss, Eyedol. That made the game experience even more fun. The CD it came with has awesome tracks to play as well if you manage to find one with it."
3,"Great SNES title, still doesn't hold a candle to the arcade","This game is one of the few games to really push the SNES's power. This and Donkey Kong Country are probably the best looking games ever on the system. That being said this is no wear near the arcade game. I mean no where near.The game retains the characters and moves, but the players smaller and moves are choppy. The back grounds are still pretty good looking, but the port lost a few stages. And none where 3D like the arcade. So smaller characters and choppier animation makes the game not seem whole. This being said, they really did everything they could with the system. The arcade KI I would give a 5star, but I can't do that for this port because I liked the arcade version so much. But the arcade version was over four times larger. If you get to an arcade with one, give it a go. I think you'll agree that that was one of the best fighters of the 90s. This is only a port of that, but style a good game."
2,Beautifully crafted -- but I prefer Homer's version,"This volume puts Homer's Odyssey together with the breakup of a modern marriage; Penelope, Odysseus, Circe, and Telemachus are modified thereby. Her idea works sometimes -- in the Circe poems especially -- but sometimes not. The modern couple bickers in ways calculated to wound, even years after the divorce; but in Homer, Penelope and Odysseus did not bicker or divorce, nor did Telemachus sound as though he'd gone through years of therapy. Call me sentimental: I like Homer better."
3,Big Al Downing,"This isn't a real bad cd, it's just not up to par with some of his other releases.There are some pretty good songs on here but the whole cd just doesn't grab you like his other releases do."
1,Want my return refund,When I purchased the product I had n0 idea that it was to be used for the back bald spots notfor receding hair in the front of my head. I sent the product back to the seller but nothing hashappened please investigate for me because I like buying from Amazon. thank you.
3,Should wait and see,"Until now, i dont see any change, i did shed few hair that before, still trying it, i feel, now the amount of hair fall is reducded. will update this later"
3,just started treatment with rogaine,I know that a full 4 month treatment is required for optimal results. but after two months i can say that i have noticed a reduction in hair loss. no regrowth yet. I will try the rogaine foam next time because the liquid leaves a greasy feel and complicate styling.
1,caused worse balding,"Rogaine caused worse balding, however after quitting it, it regrew some and is back to where it was before Rogaine."
1,Miss leading description,"Rogaine and/or Amazon intentionally do not mention that this product is only for ""Vertex"" hair loss on the webpage. It won't work on front at all. Even though it is mentioned in the product manual. But it will be way too late when you open the box and read the manual.You cannot return the product due to the fact that it is ""hazard liquid"" :(So, my money just say ""bye bye""...Again, DO NOT buy if you are losing hair other than on your ""Vertex""!!"
1,Thought this was the foam product by mistake.,This product doesn't work as well as the foam product. You use a dropper apply the product in liquid form and it doesn't have the ease of use the foam does.
1,"Can't use, can't return","I bought this product and then found out that it will not work for my particular type of balding. Now I cannot return it even though I never opened it and I'm out $85. Further, I also found out that if you ever stop using Rogaine, you're hair falls out quicker than if you never used it at all. WARNING: If you buy this, it cannot be returned, it only works on one specific type of baldness, and if you ever stop using, all your hair will fall out."
4,It works!,"It works, I've used it for several years now. Inconvenient as far as drying time so I'm trying the foam too and it seems to be working."
4,Good Product,I have used this product for approximately 3 months and there has been hair growth. After 3 more months if the improvement continues I would give this product 5 stars.
3,Rogaine,"I was hoping to get a little more details about the product, such as, the expiration date, side effects and the description of the product. Basically, I was looking for a product with helps thinning hair and receeding hair lines for the frontal scalp. When I received the order and read the details. I realized it wasn't the product I was looking for. This product was for people going bald in the back and primarly targets regrowth or hair. Which I mis-understood."
4,"LOTR Minimates #2, By a 12 year old","This Minimate pack has Gandalf, Frodo, Gollum/Smeagol, and a Hidden figure.Gandalf: The best figure in this pack. He comes with a sword, scabbard, and his staff. He has great facial likeness, but his hair/beard are one piece, restricting head movement.Frodo: Comes with Sting, scabbard, and The One Ring. The ring is on a little string, but Frodo can't hold it easily. His face shows signs of femininity, and it could be a good Arwen face.Gollum/Smeagol: Comes with a fish. There isn't much to say. His face looks good, but he can't be put into any of the 'crawling' poses from the movie.Uruk-Hai Berserker: Comes with his Sword and Helmet. His helmet is a little two round, but it makes him kind of cute.Overall: If you like LOTR, buy this set. I like the other one more, but if you like bad guys, get this set. I can't wait for my 2-packs to arrivre!"
2,Frustrating!,"I bought this for my young son who loves LOTR. He was happy just have to have LOTR toys, as they aren't that easy to find. They are frustrating. The pieces do not stay together well, and we have lost MANY of hte tiny tiny pieces. Fine if you want to keep in box as a keepsake, but not good for little fingers to actually play with."
2,FOR beginners,"This book is good for beginners who want to use simple functions of Dreamweaver 8. However, if you are looking for advanced features or doing things beyond simple text and simple images this book is not for you."
2,Geometrical Design Review,"This coloring book was a disappointment to me, as I was looking for really good geometric designs and I just didn't find them to be the type I would use."
3,It is all right,"I think this book is just all right. The patterns are pretty simple. And honestly if I had known that I probably would not have bought it. Kids might enjoy it though. I really don't know how to rate it, it is just not my style."
5,Too Cool and Great Price,I bought this coloring book for my Grandaughter's 8th birthday. Not only were all the little girls coloring in it but the teenagers and some adults were as well. Everyone loved it.
5,Coloring isn't just for kids!,"This book is great for someone of any age! As the publisher notes, you can choose any combination of colors for a geometric design as opposed to a scene with people or objects. And if you photocopy or scan/print the designs, you can color them over and over choosing new colors each time. There are a nice variety of designs, 46 in all. Many of them are circular, mandala-like designs. Most are suitable for crayons, colored pencils, or markers, while a few have tighter spaces better suited for colored pencils or fine-tipped markers.These coloring pages make a great activity for kids and a wonderful practice in stress relief, meditation, or just time-wasting for teens and adults of all ages. I'm a college student, and we have one of these at home. I just ordered two; one as a gift for a friend, and one for myself here at school. Highly recommended."
4,Vintage recipes,"Although I did not purchase this cookbook on Amazon, I was given a copy that has been handed down for three generations. One of the greatest features of this cookbook are the blank pages which the original owner filled with family recipes. This book was one of the main resources and inspirations for my own Not So Secret Family Recipes cookbook series."
5,Excellent reprint of an extremely important work.,"Look To Germany is by far the most important and impressive English-language piece of propaganda produced prior to the beginning of WW2 by the NSDAP. This reprint is an excellent facsimilie of the original, which I am very grateful to the publishers for; the original copies typically sell for $300+. This book is a must for any person interested in the truth behind the NSDAP, and for any person interested in changing our current political climate. In addition, this book depicts the pride and glory of the German people before Allied oppression."
5,Incredible!,"This book is a masterpiece. It is fascinating from both a historical and political point of view. As the author admits, it *is* propaganda, but it shows a side of the Third Reich so often forgotten in modern day books and television documentaries. A must read for anyone interested in WWII!"
4,Aviance,"Prince Matchabelli is another company that has been around for a fair amount of time & still produces great products without trying to cut corners.The ladies can use this spray any time of the day or night & never be out of place wherever they go. The scent is not overpowering like so many others can be. This is a very sweet & powdery scent that can used anytime,anywhere."
3,"Pretty undertones, but smells cheap","Being a musk-lover, I was totally excited to smell this perfume after reading all of the positive reviews.I received it today and was most disappointed...it has a sweet, light-ish musky smell in it that I like, but unfortunately, it's positively overwhelmed by a scent that I can only describe as ""cheap-perfume smell.""Now, don't mistake me for a perfume snob--I'm anything but and nearly gag every time I walk past a department store fragrance section because they're so strong. But this has a chemical undertone that I wouldn't want people to associate with me. It reminds me of the 80s...all the perfumes seemed to have it back then."
5,Night Musk,I have worn this perfume for years. The stores have stopped carrying it so now I buy it thru Amazon. I love this perfume and when I order it thru here. The box is in perfect shape and I get it in very good time.
3,Aviance Night Musk,"Like alot of women I used this cologne years ago then all of a sudden it dissapeared from stores. I was just thrilled when I came across it online so ordered it right away. I was dissappointed in it when I received it...just not the same as it used to be. It does not smell as good or last as long but, I also found the musk perfume oil which has not changed!! Just wish you could get it in a bigger bottle!!"
1,Another Boring/Hard Star Trek Game on the SNES,as much as I wanted to love this game there was just nothing to love. game is hard and slightly boring I stopped playing after about an hour. avoid at all costs. 1 star.
4,Great game to play against the computer!,"This is the normal Monopoly game only its for your Super Nintendo. Its a great game to play against the computer, but it is very difficult to play with multi players. There are no real graphic enhancements, other than the pictures on the cards move around, and when you move from space to space Uncle Pennybags, walks along the streets to the next space. Pretty good game, but not everyone likes board games."
2,It Looks Fun.....,"If you want to check out this game, I suggest you rent it first. It gets tiring and some people like it more than others. RENT IT FIRST!"
4,Bicycle Built for Two,"Having just completed a coast to coast bike trip and having done many tandem trips, this book for me was thoroughly enjoyable. We met Mrs. Young when she was no longer young - but still full of vitality. When she made the trip and wrote the book, she not only had incredible energy, but a zest for life and an appreciation for all she encountered that are hard to match. The unique style is marred only by a little of the racial attitudes of the time. But the book on the whole is difficult to put down and can inspire all who have not yet taken bicycle trips - on tandems or singles - to do so."
2,Fog,"Landscaper in Indiana wear it to work everyday sand, dirt, water, mud and snow. I like the watch but i got the fog on my screen like another reviewer and my watch completely reset it self at least twice in one year. Sent it for warranty repair and and since then i have gotten the fog back about 2 times since the repair 3 months ago."
1,Low Sound on Alarm,"The watch looks great. It could take a pounding and keep going. Price is Okay and it got here in good time. It has 5 alarms, hourly chime, and other sounds if only you could hear it. I'm not kidding that Casio has messed up on just about every new watch that is coming out. You have to have the thing next to your ear to even hear it. I have an old watch which sits on the table about 20 feet from me. I lost the instructions, so now every day at 3:20 pm the damn thing goes off. Loud and clear for about 2 1/2 minutes unless I get my lazy butt up and push a button. Anyway, if you don't need the alarm, then go for it. The buttons that are hard to push was not a big deal for me."
3,OK watch,Pros:1. Nice look.2. Very Solid.3. Worth spending 50 bucks.4. Light weight.Cons:1. CHI time is Eastern time. It should be Central time zone. This sucks.2. Buttons are really hard to press.
4,tough watch,"i use this watch for work, everyday, i need a tough watch that works in all conditions and can withstand construction jobs from cement jobs to excavation, mud and water. this is the watch to wear if you want tough."
2,Useless features,"The beep on this watch is so quiet that it renders the alarms and countdown features of this watch useless. This was my first Casio so I don't know if that's common with all their watches or not. I did call their service and they say the watch is working correctly = it just has a quiet beeps. My watches from other makers have a countdown and alarm beep that is loud enough to be noticed. If you use those features, you might want to try a different model or different maker."
2,"To be fair it may just be me, but it was really uncomfortable.","It was uncomfortable to wear. The fit was completely unrefined. In fact I went with my original instinct (i was going to buy the GW 5600-J originally but didn't want to wait, but I found out it wouldn't take as long to get it). The GW 5600-J is a much more comfortable watch (it is still a gshock and they are not the most comfortable ones for sure but offer many functions, rugged durability, and cool looks.Back to the mudman:It has these nubs on the back of the piece that are hard plastic -- totally uncomfortable compared to a normal flat back, I see no advantage except maybe they don't case as much sweat or something. But even still totally not worth it. I returned this watch and got a GW5600-J. I would recommend anything other than the mudman for a classic gshock fit."
5,Aussies buy your CASIOs at Amazon!,"I got this watch to Australia in 5 days!!! Amazing service. The price was 2/3 off the RRP in AUS so a great deal.The watch is ideal, the casing is more exciting than the functions. Would have preferred a more involved watch like a Riseman or even a Pathfinder or perhaps a Suunto military but this is a much better option than the all black version too for visibility.The features a pretty run of the mill but really its a versatile watch with A1 protection rather than lots of gimmicks.The lighting from the Dual EL setup is spot on as is the automatic mode. Perfect for night shifts.I've always used a NATO band with my Citizen Aqualand so a rubber band is a new thing for me. Might have to try and find a NATO band for this watch.You can't go wrong with this watch. Simplicity Toughness and a great price."
4,Larry,"THIS WATCH IS WORTH THE PURCHASE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO ISSUES THAT I BELIEVE CASIO COULD EASILY CHANGE, THE WRIST BAND IS NOT THE SAME HEAVY SOLID QUALITY OF MY PREVIOUS GSHOCK THAT HELD UP FOR 8 YEARS AND THE VOLUME OF THE ALARM CAN ONLY BE HEARD IN TOTAL DEAD SILENCE. ALSO IF THE ONLINE OPERATION MANUAL WAS NOT AVAILABLE, THE ONE WITH THE WATCH IS NOT WORTH THE TIME OF DAY OR ENERGY TO READ. NO WATCH IS PERFECT AND I AM TOTALLY HAPPY WITH THE MUDMAN WITH MANY PLUS'S.I AM TOTALLY HAPPY WITH SERVICE AND FOLLOW UP EMAIL WITH TRACKING INFO AND PURCH. CONFORMATION AND ONLINE STATUS FROM AMAZON. TO ME I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE KNOWING AMAZON WAS THE SELLER"
5,Mudman G Shock,"The G Shock Mudman has turned out to be exactly the watch I was looking for. It is not the high priced tactical unit that I started out looking for but it seems to be the right size, durable (so far), and easy to use. The few negative reviews that I saw before I purchased mentioned size (too big) and ease of use (buttons too hard to push). If you need a much smaller watch in a rugged outdoors application, you might want to consider a woman's style. As far as the buttons are concerned, the watch is rated as water resistant to 200 meters and is designed to be impervious to mud. The necessary sealing action associated with the buttons does make them a little stiff, but that should be expected. For the price, it is fine for everyday wear, hunting, fishing, camping, and the gym."
3,functions great,this watch functions great but now that I have it I really dont care for the looks of it. I shoulda opted for a more expensive one or a cheep knock off walmart one...
4,Bought this for my man for his birthday,"I read all the reviews on this watch and thought it would fit my guy's personality much better than the silver plated, out dated digital he'd been wearing since the dark ages. He didn't really care for it at first--too high tech for him. He complained that the strap wouldn't stay in the loop, so, I glued a piece of velcro onto it and he loves it now. Thank goodness."
5,Casio G Shock Watch,"I love this watch it takes a beating but does not stop. I am very hard on watches and cell phones they dont last long with me, but this watch is still going strong."
5,AWESOME G-SHOCK!,"This is a AWESOME watch! Casio never lets me down! The only thing I would complain about is that the buttons are really hard to push, but after awhile, you get use to it. I would DEFINATELY recommened this watch to anybody looking for a durable/great looking watch."
5,G-Shock Mudman,"Excellent product, exactly as described. Large clear display, easy to understand instructions.Amazons Express International DHL delivery was excellent and package arrived within a week."
5,G-shock G9000-1v,Casio Men's G9000-1V G-Shock Mudman Digital Sports WatchGreat watch clear face lightweight fits my wrist good and i would recommend it to anyone
4,Mud?,"Everything went smooth. Good watch, lost my 1st G-Shock, this is the replacment. Only wish I purchased another Solar."
4,A VERY AGRESSIVE WATCH,"I just get this watch a few days ago. I buyed it because the really agressive look it sport. I have had previously a Casio HD600 for 18 months so I already knew the gimmick of this watches. In this model was aditionally important to me: 200 meter WR, shock & mud ressistance, the automatic light feature and the mineral glass. The buttons are stiff but not unpleasant. The only two things I would add are a bilingual week days (English-Spanish) and a 60/40 distribution of the dial for the hour-date display, since you look the time much more than the date. The price on Amazon was the lowest. Vicente."
4,MUDMAN G9000-1V,Pros:Very water proof.Love the illumination.Comfortable band after initial getting used too.Multiple alarms are handy.Large illumination button is nice.Band latch is easy to use.Cons:Alarm is very quiet.Flash setting for alarm only works for 6 hours. If you want it to flash in the morning so you can see it without pushing a button you can't.You can't set the alarms to go off every weekday at noon and have a seperate alarm to go off every Sunday at 7AM. If you set the alarm for 7AM it goes off at every 7AM. You can set for a specific date if needed.
4,A good watch,"I got it for my BF who is an engineer. He works in a demanding environment.G-Shock is the best quality watch and ""Mud Man"" is great for his job requirement."
3,Public Enemy?,"This watch is defintly everything that the write up says it is. Super rugged and it has all the features. One thing I hated about it was the size. I felt like I had one of flav a flavs giant clocks on my wrist. I have a medium sized wrist and it just looked kind of ridiculous. If you are used to giant g shocks this wont be a problem but I didnt like it at all. Also, the display is tiny. I am sure this watch will last forever though. Just make sure you know what you are getting.I returned this and got the g shock classic :[...]which seems to be just as rugged from the reviews and it is much smaller and feels way better on my wrist. It is also way easier to navigate. I like it a lot better!"
5,Mudman rocks!!!,The perfect watch that I need for everyday wear. Typical Amazon satisfaction!!!!Which is why I continue to shop only with them!!!!
4,Big and Balanced,"This is a beautifully shot and well done video on the Three Gorges Dam. It presents both compelling arguments for the construction of the dam, and the dam's opponents arguments as well. But its real strength is capturing the scale of the project. Not just the dam itself, but the relocations and new construction of whole cities involved. I showed it to a class of 12th graders as part of their History of China class and they found it compelling.-dls"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"This game started off ok. Around December 11 for me the game suddenly froze. Couldn't do anything. So I emailed 2K sports about it. They replied with this:You'll run into a freezing issue any time you use the trade finder, save your franchise, restart the system, and sim/play a game between the dates of Nov 20th and the trade deadline with CPU trading turned on. There is only one way to use the trade finder safely without causing problems in your franchise. After using the trade finder you must sim/play a day between Nov 20th and the trade deadline with CPU trading turned on before saving your franchise. So find trades, sim/play a day, then save.The problem is I never play with computer trading on. The computer makes the worst trades. So the franchise is freezing anytime I make a trade. Is there a patch? Absolutely not. They rushed this thing to get out and now a lot of people are stuck with a $60 piece of junk.Buyer Beware."
2,Seriously Flawed,"Had the same problem as the above reviewer, the game freezes in franchise mode. For me, the date was always November 28th.Additionally, the commentators during gameplay are horrible. This for me is usually not a big issue, because I NEVER consider this an integral part of the game. However, the announcers consistently declared that my goalie (the one on the bench) had won the face-off. Annoying."
2,NHL 08 > NHL 2K8,NHL 2K8 is now stuck in the mud and getting stale. It doesn't even feel Next Gen compared to NHL 08. I played both games and NHL 08 is easily the better hockey game this year by far. Get back to the drawing board 2K!
5,Came back for more!,I loved Marcus's first C.D. And had to come back for more. Would love to see him at a live concert. I played his music at a dinner party and got rave reviews!
1,13 Days,I bought this item solely for the movie thirteen days in the triple pack. I thought I was saving money and so got that pack because it was three movies for the price of one but the only one that didn't play was thirteen days so I through out the movie. I went back and bought another one so I wasted 10 bucks tryinf to make a deal when I should have just bought in the first place
3,13 Days Editions?,"I have noticed that there are two editions to Thirteen Days listed on Amazon. The ""Infinifilm Edition"" (listed as both 2000 and 2001??) and the 2006 ""basic edition"" triple pack? I don't know what they call that edition. The Infinifilm version is sold as a stand-alone single DVD and is also listed on some pages as being the version included in the Triple Pack. But just a moment ago I saw the unnamed version listed in the Triple Pack and also as a stand-alone!Clearly I am confused as to which version is ""better."" I'm going to buy the Triple Pack just for the bargain 3-for-1, but I'd really like to know if there any differences between the two?"
3,Interesting synopsis...,"That's an interesting synopsis of this (as-yet-unpublished) book . . . shouldn't it mention something about ""The first inside account of how AOL built its business on the backs of hundreds of employees who were then summarily discarded at the first hint of trouble""? And where's ""The story of how AOL bought up many competing technologies which it then failed to develop to their potential""? (Oh, sorry--only that evil Bill Gates would do something like that, perhaps aided by an army of brainwashed ""netheads"" acting as his own personal militia in the ongoing ""war for the web"".)(It's probably unfair of me to review a synopsis, but honestly, with a title like this . . . . Can you say ""fluff piece""?)"
4,Why AOL will survive ?,"If you want to know the reasons behind the AOL and its ability to survive against microsoft, read this book. Excellent book."
1,Go Right To BURN RATE,"I've just read two books that tell the AOL story. This one and BURN RATE. This one acts like AOL is just another good-luck entreprenurial success story, la-di-dah. If you've ever done any business with AOL--and who hasn't--you'll want to skip this kiss job and go right to BURN RATE."
4,Insider look on the world of Internet commerce.,This book is a very informative and interesting book about how America Online started as a small company that ran a bbs to a multi-billion dollar giant with millions of members.Aol.com features many sources from people inside AOL and Microsoft that tell how Microsoft was too late to the Internet and Online service market.
3,Interesting history but not a great book.,"This book describes the history of AOL from its beginning, which in fact it is remarkably interesting (AOL was not the ""big gorilla"" a few years ago, though it is easy to forget that). The book reads well (nice for bedtime, when the brain is tired) but I think that the content is very superficial and tells little about the real business behind the critical events during the development Internet and on-line services. I expected much more from this book.."
3,Reads like a newspaper,Pretty interesting account of the AOL story. This would have been a lot better if more of a business perspective was used to discuss and analyze the strategies that made AOL the leader.
4,Very good history from the top level,"This well-researched book will give you a great basic understanding of how this company that has become a household name was formed. Swisher seems to have had access to most of the top-level AOL executives of the time.For a more ""inside"" view of what AOL is like from the ""trenches,"" and employees' own versions of what the founding of the company was like, I would recommend ""My Life at AOL"" by Julia L. Wilkinson."
4,Whose afraind of the big bad beast?,"AOL is, or was. This is a kind of a drier and more formal rendition of how AOL grew up. It's got facts, so many facts.... and yet you want to know more, you can't let the book lie unopened for too long. Yet it doesn't captivate, mesmerize and pull you in as the other great ""Silicon Valley"" books, like ""The Nudist on the Late Shift"", ""The Plot to Get Bill Gates"", and ""Silicon Boys"".With all these books cascading through my consciousness, this book somehow offers material not covered in the others. I was finally able to tie all my Silicon Valley and Everest Climbing books (my 1999 summer jag) together. The link was established with Bill and Sandy Hill Pittman. Now all I have to do is establish the link with anorexia and bulimia."
2,anecdotes,"Having listened to Ms Swisher's knowledgeable interview on national public radio's ""fresh air"" I looked forward to this work. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The conveying of one anecdote after another style of writing does not equate to first rate worke"
4,AMAZING THE AOL IS STILL HERE!,"Very fascinating and detailed look at the early and middle years of AOL (before the latest difficulties with TimeWarner merger). We see just how amazingly close we came to not having an AOL at all. Steve Case and his partners and co-horts came so close so many times to going belly up, yet the book also shows how others failed to capitalize on AOL's weaknesses and failed to understand its strengths.It's a good read for anyone, but if you're an AOL user, it'll give you a true insight into this important company. It's an easy, fast read, too, which you might not expect. The latest issue was updated once, through 1999. I'd love to see it updated again in a few months, to cover all the Time Warner stuff and many reorganizations that have gone on just lately."
2,"Promising, but fails to deliver","I enjoyed the subject matter of the book greatly, but must admit I was disappointed by the way in which it was presented. The author, while attempting to capture the energy of the web, frequently fails to express the facts in a logical manner, often needlessly encrypting simple statements.This book was great from the factual information covered, but it focused more on the upper level moves, a single chapter dedicated to the enabling technology (which perhaps the author assumed each reader already had) would have gone a long way. Unfortunately I feel that this omission was made because of the author's own ignorance, and not for the reasons mentioned above.The book also focused quite a bit on major players, and attempted to embolden what was already a very lively story through prostelitizing about their ""vision"" or ""quest.""Good content. Needs work on presentation."
1,Another College Game to Avoid,this game has no replay value and is not fun to begin with. avoid at all costs. 1 star.
4,Definitely a good toolkit,"I just started reading this book and currently only on pg 45. The amount of useful information it gave me so far feels like I spent half a semester in class. To be honest, the book is a bit out of date with its sources and WebPages it refers to. But, don't let this fool you, it's still a good read for anyone who is in the beginning stages of their PR careers trying to learn useful media relations techniques necessary for success within the industry."
3,"Ok, but very online biased","Online is definitely the way of the future, but this book could have presented a little more balanced a picture on the PR landscape. Good as a read, but possibly not the best first book that you should spend money on on the topic."
5,Encouraging and thought-provoking,"Ms. Rabey has done a wonderful job of showing us how and why we as women keep ourselves from achieving our full potential as life-givers. Though she makes us take a hard look at our spiritual lives, she encourages us every step of the way. Each chapter includes questions for discussion or journaling. Women at our church have also formed a study group to go through the book together. I highly recommend this book for any woman who feels burned out and used up."
1,"damaged hole, but they don't change or return.","The item is damaged in new box. Water flow out of it ! I can only store little water to avoid water touching the damaged hole. I request to change items, but they reply that the item is delivered directly from the factory, so they don't accept change or return."
5,Can Pike ever top this book?,"I love Sita's story, and how Mr. Pike tied in the story of her past with this book. I don't care what anyone else says, I never hated Kalika, she was just doing what was in her nature. If you want to sit on your seat the whole time, and read about how Sita overcomes all odds again.My favorite part in this book would either be when Sita is with her friend Suzama in the court talking to the Queen, or when she confrunts Kalika when she got a hold of the Christ child. You will love this book too. It's a ten."
5,This book is good but sad,"This book is a wonderful read! But, dont read it unless you read the first 4 Last Vampire Books. You just dont get whats happening if you read this one first. But, the end is sad.....almost had me crying. The end is also happy to! I realize Im probably just confusing you with all this: Its happy, but its sad stuff so ill just say this: read this book! or read the first four, then read this book! :) he-he"
1,"Poorly written, boring illustrations","I agree with the other review. There is absolutely nothing about these stories that make them suited for a five year old child. The writing is bad. Based on the jacket, I have a sense that it was privately published by the authors.Don't bother."
2,Don't buy this if you buy Caprica Season 1.0,"I loved watching Battlestar Galactica on DVD having missed it when it was on the air. I wanted to keep a good thing going and knew I wanted to buy all of the Caprica prequels to watch. So I ordered this pilot disk, Caprica Season 1.0 and Caprica Season 1.5. When I got them here, I found that this pilot episode is also included in the Season 1.0 disk set. I didn't want others to get suckered into the ""frequently bought together"" Amazon shtick and order more than they needed."
5,Caprica:The Movie Unrated,"im glad we at least got this brilliant movie and the one season show that helped enhance the BSG universe. Its important now more than ever to watch this showbecause it will serve as a backround setting for the new BSG feature film, BLOOD & CHROME, since very little about the Cylons and their makers and how they revolted against mankind, so i think youll find it interesting if you havent seen it already."
3,A drab drama about dull people,"""Battlestar Galactica: Caprica"" tells the interesting and revealing story of the creation of the Cylons, but otherwise it is a drab drama about dull people. Ron Moore, who co-wrote ""Caprica"", says in the commentary that they wanted ""Caprica"" to be a drama that centers on compelling characters, and in my humble opinion they have failed. Much like ""Battlestar Galactica"", most of the characters in ""Caprica"" are so depressed that they are nearly motionless. ""Caprica"" does resemble ""Battlestar Galactica"" in its tone and themes, but it does not approach the best episodes of ""Galactica"". Missing are the compelling crises and the fragile moments of choice. Also missing, for what it's worth, are the action sequences and supermodels. I do not plan to watch the series. The DVD has commentary from the creators and deleted scenes. Reviewed 4/21/2009 after watching on DVD."
3,It's ok but..,"This movie only makes sense if you've seen the latest version of Battlestar GalacticaBattlestar Galactica: The Complete 2004 Series [Blu-ray]. It is also pretty boring unless you've seen that series.The writing is complicated with a distinct British Sy-Fi flare for complexity over content. The movie and the series Caprica, open several interesting sub-plots and leaves most of them unresolved. The series had great potential and interest, but now it appears to be just another good idea that goes nowhere."
4,Interesting pilot to a much anticipated sequel.,"This is the pilot for the much slower moving BSG prequel. It does enough to pull you into the plot and basically sets up the details for how we got to where we were in BSG. My hope with this series is that they will show us a bit more of the Cylons as they free themselves from the humans and maybe even the Cylon war. Though I doubt this will be shown. I really enjoyed the BSG series, so I am interested that they are doing a prequel. I just hope this series picks up a little more steam with the plot. It is a bit more slow moving than the BSG series, but they are not at war, so it is not really fair to compare the two. That may turn some fans off, but it is what it is. I am sure Ron Moore would not have signed up to to it if he did not think there was a story worth telling, so I will watch the series for at least the first season."
2,Somewhat of a let down,Following up with what was one of the best Sci-fi shows (along with Farscape) of all time we have the BSG prequal. I found the story itself lacking and the charactors shallow and not well developed. Halfway through the show it was a struggle to pay attention to what was going on.
3,Glad I didn't buy,"Save your money and watch it on tv or rent it. Caprica didn't knock my socks off. It's just ok.The first 10-15 minutes of the show are ""R"" rated. There are boobs, sex scenes, and brutal killings. I wasn't bored with Caprica. It just wasn't that interesting. It played out more like an episode of ""Gossip Girls.""The technology and special effects are decent. Unfortunately, the story is weak. I didn't care for the Zoe character or the other teens. They were so whiny. The more interesting characters like Zoe's mother, one of her teachers at school, and William Adama were ignored. Also, I didn't buy the whole Joseph Adama (hidden past) mob storyline."
2,Slow and not always clear.,"Did I miss something or was any reason given why the minister was killed ever explained? I had a problem with that part of the story and wanted to see more cylons. Someone mentioned more fun with cylons but don't going into this story there will be alot of cylon activity, it is basically just how they were created."
2,Disappointing,"Hard to believe this slow, plodding product comes from the same group that produced so many riveting BSG items."
4,"This won't be a helpful review, but...","""I"" (me, myself, I) think the Ron Moore BSG series is the greatest show in the history of television (Sci-Fi catagory), so I was curious what Moore would do w/ Colonial history. Let's just say I quite enjoyed the Caprica movie and look forward to the Caprica series."
1,Seriously $19.99 to download and watch,Do they thing we're stupid? This is an outrage. I can go rent from Blockbuster for $3.99 or wait until it shows up in my Netflix queue. I thought the new VOD was supposed to be a cool thing but if this is the model of things to come no thanks! I wonder how many people have actually paid the money. Highway robbery! Insulting to all BSG fans!
3,Sci-Wish,"Strange Days meets Matrix in Star Wars, not sure this makes a good series. I do like the MyVu attempt to commercialize the holoband idea. I am sure the ""VClub"" (virtual night clubs) attracts many young people. I would like to see my Avatar participate in a show episode, the story might benefit from viewer participating in a virtual community as a part of the show experience."
1,They should have started this new series at the dawn of the Cylon war,"and showed us a young Adama, just getting his wings. This prequel is GARBAGE!!!!"
1,Do Not Watch,Look I bought this dvd Oh My i should have passed it was so bad they never tell you the back story nothing i was so unhappy with this movie!!!do not watch this hope this helps
1,Wait on it,"This is just an extended edition of the Pilot episode. The series Caprica has been signed up on Sci-fi as 19 episodes (1 2 hour long pilot, and 18 hour long episodes) so I would wait on buying it because why buy a single episode when you can buy the rest plus this?"
3,Caveat emptor: Beware the Double Dip!,"Just going on history, there will be a ""double dip"". The BSG pilot came out on DVD, then it was released on the Season 1 box set. ""Razor"" came out on DVD, then it was released on the Season 4 box set. Now the ""Caprica"" pilot is being released on DVD. If you want to buy it now, no one is stopping you. The more frugal may want to wait, though; because what is on this DVD will undoubtedly be released on the Caprica Season 1 box set.NOTE: stars are for this pre-double-dip DVD release, not the content of the show."
4,Enjoyed Caprica but it skewed the timeline.,"I enjoyed the DVD, Caprica has potential for a compelling series. It answered my question as to why cylons were monotheistic in BSG. But the timeline doesn't make sense to me when taking into account the storyline of the five from BSG. Hopefully it will work out in the Caprica series or maybe it was just overlooked."
2,Wait for BSG 4.5 before buying...,Before you lay down your money for this you may want to see if BSG season 4.5 includes this movie. Season 4.0 included the movie Razor and they may do the same next time around. As for the movie it does look very compelling from the clip provided above. Looking forward to the movie and the series - let's hope it's another BSG.
2,This is no Batlestar Galactica,"I watched this and was disappointed. Sure, Galactica was a bit dry at time but this show is worse. I didn't really care for the characters, especially the young ones, so why would I want to watch this show on a regular basis.Let's face it, I have never been a fan of prequels because you know from the original story what will happen to most of these people and in this case you know Caprica is blown up and only one of the characters, that we have seen thus far, will be alive for Galactica."
3,Not Looking Forward to this,"First off I would not buy this as this will be released in the future as part of a season boxset and I am not going to be double-dipped again.I would rather download a krappy watermarked divx than spend my money on a product that will be double-dipped just like we have seen with BSG in the past.On another note I have the strong feeling i will dislike this show as it seems to be an even more soap opera than BSG was.I hate soap operas and straight up drama shows.At least BSG had my attention cause it had a lot of cool scfi type entertainment mixed in to the drama.We saw outer space,cylons,space battles,exploring planets,intrigue,and more actiony type plots.In a few weeks we will see what gives on Caprica and then we will know if it is Crapica or Caprica."
2,Caprica can't stand on its own.,"Battlestar Galactica is one of the best shows ever. Caprica however falls short. The only thing that kept me watching is the fact its apart of the Galactica universe and that it might answer a few questions the show didn't.Pro's+Acting is great.+Does provide some insight into the Galactica universe.+Pretty good cliffhanger.Con's-Some parts are as boring as watching paint dry.-Holographic internet glasses... don't remember those from battlestar..-No action at all.-Alot of O.C. like drama.When this show airs I will watch it, mostly cause Battlestar is over and, Lost only has one more season."
4,Cparica,"They should have called this ""More Fun With Cylons"". I have to wonder how much of this miniseies will carry over into the show when it finally starts."
2,No Battlestar,"Battlestar fans don't need to watch this. I went in knowing this is not a Battlestar episode, but a prelogue to the series. I was hoping it would lay the ground work and be a precursor to the angst the Cylons were experiencing to maybe provide a better insight into the whole God/Machine/Human dichotomy struggle. It did not. Acting was good, story/writing poor, many better avenues this story could have pursued, kinda disappointing, and dead end. I don't know if they intend to make more, god I hope not..."
4,Background,"Where did it all begin. . . . where did the story start.As with all good stories, you get many answers and you ask many more. That's a good story and more to come.Thank you - - - great DVDChuck"
5,You don't need to be BSG fan to enjoy the story.,I have never seen an episode of Battlestar Galactica. I just happened to stumble on this series when I was flipping through my on-demand choices and since there was nothing that caught my interest I decided to give it a try. I found the story and characters very interesting. I like the look of the series; it has a classy 50's feel nicely woven into a modern look. I enjoyed this movie so much that I'm going to buy the entire series of Battlestar Galactica. This movie isn't just for sci-fi fans; It's for anyone who likes a good story with some gripping and moving moments.
5,A Great Pilot For A Great TV Series!!,"Caprica is a great TV series worth catching on tv.The time period is set before Battlestar Galactica, but slowly explains what happens before BG begins.This series is very slow paced, so just give it time and you might just enjoy it.The Pilot episode on the DVD is the beginning of the series and sets up the story for the next epsiodes.The performance's are excellent, the cast does an amazing job with their characters.Give Caprica a chance!!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised.,"OK, I knew it wasn't BSG, and I was prepared to be let down. I love Eric Stoltz, however, so I gave it a shot. This is a terrific pilot! I hope they can maintain this quality during the regular season. While it does show us why Cylons were originally created and has other direct ties to BSG, I expect that this series will be a complete stand-alone.Caprica is very like Earth, of course. Parents are emotionally cut-off; kids are running amok. There is racism, class warfare and religious schisms. While these topics and the comparison to our society could be heavy-handed and irritating, these issues do drive the story and are therefore necessary. Rather than being lectured to, we Earthlings are left alone to observe a sister civilization and draw whatever conclusions we might.Cinematography is a little self-conscious, but sure is nice looking!"
2,INSANE!!!,As you probably can tell from my title I have some issues with this initial offering from Amazon. 1. Did someone really consciously believe that preview was enough to entice someone into buying this...seriously. How about some QC here...I mean the credits and the blur of a intro scene. I don't think so. 2. So I have to pay $14.99 for a pilot of Caprica. Don't get me wrong I would like to see this but not at that price. I seriously doubt that there will be many casual takers willing to purchase this. Obviously this price plays on the fans out there starving for more BSG. Amazon will be giving this away as soon as this airs and especially if this isn't well received. 3. I can't rent(VOD) this at a lower price??? Like 3.99! Why only the option to purchase? I mean this isn't a Summer blockbuster movie. It's a freaking pilot. I guess I'll wait until this title que's up in my Blockbuster account and watch it through my normal subscription price which is 19.99 a month. You do the math.
5,the start of the end!,"I just got thru watching this-if this is going to be a series as promised for the 2010 debut on Sci Fi then it will be an intriguing and surprising show of course more different than BSG but to see how the Cylon came to be! In the last 15 minutes of Caprica, my reaction was ""Ok, we got GAME! Now, where are they going to take us!?"" Can't wait for the Series!"
4,Still no caption support on Amazon video downloads :-(,"I've been using Amazon video downloads to my TiVo for over a year now, and while the service works great, and this was a nice production in HD, I remain disappointed and frustrated that there is no support for captions or subtitles with video downloads yet. While $20 might be cheaper than Blu-Ray, at least with disks I know for sure I'll get subtitles. When are you going to stop discriminating against the hearing-impaired, Amazon ?"
4,Great show,"This was a great movie that showed how everything came about in the regular Battlestar Galactica. It showed just how the cylons were born and why. The only thing I don't understand is if this happened 58 years before the show starts. If I remember right the cylons rebelled and were gone for 50 years. They had that lone guy sitting at the outpost waiting for them to come and talk peace. That's when six walked in and had the guy killed and the start of the war. The only problem is how did the cylons developed that fast (in 8 years) to think they wanted to be free? Other then that I loved the show and can't wait till 2010 to start watching, hope it will be around as long as or longer then Battlestar Galactica. Can someone answer the question for me? Thanks"
1,What a huge disappointment!!!,I had high hopes that the creators of BSG would carry on the tradition of an excellent story with great characters. I was immensly disappointed by Caprica. So much so that I couldn't even finish watching it. Bad acting was just one of the many things that made this the worst DVD I have purchased in quite some time.
1,Blah blah boring,"I realize that this is really just a television pilot. However. The pilot/miniseries for Battlestar Galactica is absolutely amazing. I can watch all 4 hours over and over. I'm never wasting my time on this crap again.Caprica has none of the drama or intensity of Battlestar Galactica. Also, it has none of the action. In fact, all this movie has is a lot of stating the obvious (through very long scenes of tired dialog), teenage angst and a sense that this was written for a tv network's production budget, well below that of the series.The acting was uninspiring, the lines stiff and the story felt forced and obvious. No twists and turns. No surprises. Nothing good in any way, shape or form. I absolutely loved BSG and still think it's one of the best dramas ever to be aired on television, and this movie is nothing short of a blight on that legacy. Utter garbage."
3,"Like most sequels, not nearly as good as its predecesor, but still better than 90% of the drivel on the tube today","Eric Stoltz would not not be my choice for the lead role, a little too wooden, but the rest of the cast is good, and the storyline should improve once the series begins."
3,Caprica - Battlestar Galactica,Interesting to see how the Cyclones came into being and a good premise for the prequel when they make the series
5,pretty nice,"pros: this little camera is a wonder to behold! it takes wonderful pictures and like everyone else is saying, it's so easy to use!cons: you might want to get an extra battery if you use it a lot. also, the software is a little slow-running on my computer. but I have a memory card port on my computer anyway, so I can easily sidestep that problem.the pros easily outweigh the cons. it's definetly worth the money. :)"
3,Excelent Camera - But terrible measure of light indoor,"This camera is excelent with outdoor pictures, excelent with movies, has excelent size, zoom, is very beatiful, and so on, BUT... has a very big problem at indoor enviroments.. It fails to measure the correct light, and the correct exposure for the picture... so, all the indoor pictures become dark... you have to set it manually, or film it (because in the movie mode, it's ok)... Hope Kodak can fix that in a firmware update, but I don't think so... I think they will correct that in a future model."
1,Camera is shoddily constructed,"After three years, I was forced to replace my old Kodak camera, which had died, with this V530. The V530 takes far superior pictures, and the video is great quality for the size of the camera. The device is compact for easy carrying. However, within four weeks of having it, it just randomly died. I sent it in for warranty work, which took SIX WEEKS to get back because they forgot to send the camera back to me. I've had the camera back for a mere two weeks now, and it has now died AGAIN for no apparent reason. This camera is completely worthless."
2,Great while it lasted...,"I had this camera for less than 3 months when the lens got stuck out and the camera was broken. There was absolutely no negative treatment to this camera. It was in perfect condition. This happened to my older Kodak, except that one was about 2 years old.Besides this, the camera is amazing. The picture quality is great and it has great features. My favorite of all features is that the camera produces stills of your video footage. This is especially useful for concerts where pictures come out all blurry and dark. In the stills, the picture quality is perfect. The only thing is that the stills are small since there's like 9 to a page for every video that you take. Great feature though. I loved this camera while I had it. But I decided to stop buying Kodak after the lens thing happened for the second time and went with Canon."
5,Best Camera in the World,"This has to be the best Camera there is. I been waiting for it to arrive in the mail. I finally got it and it works just fine. I really enjoy the video feature on the camera. Whening useing video you can zoom in and out. Not many other cameras can do that. I gave this Camera 5 stars, because it is the best."
2,Terrible Battery Life,"Camera has terrible battery life, seller did not mention this at all in the advertisement. Additionally came with piecemeal accessories, such as a charger from a PSP... seriously? The surface was dinged and the display was poor."
5,"""BEST CAMERA EVER!!!!""","i LOVE this camera!!had it you 2 years, dropped it and still have NO problems. takes perfect pics fast and the flash id quick!!! BEST BUY"
4,"Great Camera, only a couple short-comings","The camera is a great little machine! It's so tiny you can tuck it in your pocket or purse without sucking up serious space.Most of my pictures are clear & sharp. The sport function ROCKS. It was the fastest one I tested when I bought it (1.5yrs ago) I have pictures of my daughter in mid-air jumping out of a swing.The shot-to-shot refresh is non-existant (in most fuctions, except the nighttime or fireworks settings). As soon as you take one shot, you're ready for the next. This was a big bonus over my last SONY digital that took about 4-5 seconds to refresh.My primary complaint is the zoom & flash range. They both fall VERY short of what I need. I was in the 6th row at my son's graduation in an auditorium & wasn't able to get a clear shot. They were all muddy & dark. The same held true at my daughter's gymnastics meet. Any distance at all & you've lost the clarity. The zoom almost always turns out shaky looking.I'd recommend the camera however."
4,V530 Kodak,"Excellent camera! Very nice pictures at large sizes. Camera is small and easy to carry. Camera is very sturdy. Has lots of easy to use features which are selected by icon and text. Only problem is the LCD (settings icon and view finder) is very difficult to see in bright light. At a recent skydiving event, I could not adjust the camera, nor could I see where the camera was aimed."
4,Incredible Value for the Price,"I was looking for a backup point and shoot camera to my Nikon D50 and came across this fantastic little camera. Although I got it for a steal from Office Depot for [...], the average retail price is still quite a bargain. The quality of the photos are fantastic. The only gripes that I have are :that the flash is somewhat weak and that some of the custom steeings are lost after powering the camera off. I've heard a lot of negative things about the low battery life, which I'm sure are true. Since I'm using this camera as a backup to my digital SLR , I usually don't use it for long periods of time. This is the perfect camera to slip into your pocket/purse. Did I mention that it is solid as a rock- nothing plasticy about this baby ?! I can't wait to print out some of the photos that I have taken. I have some pictures from a Kodak Easyshare Z740 and the printed pictures look much better than they do on my computer monitor. I'll post some pictures soon !"
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON,"I recieved this camera for Christmas...it was broken! Sent it back to receive a new one and got the wrong camera. Sent that one back to receive a new one and AGAIN got the wrong camera! All the paperwork has the correct orders, but whoever they have sending their packages is stupid. After receiving the THIRD incorrect item I was told to either keep that item or receive a full refund and that they were not going to send me the camera I had originally ordered!"
1,Buy it someplace else,Great camera awful price! You can buy this camera for $50 cheaper at [...] or $100 cheaper at other sites.
4,Travel Charger is not needed,"Please don't purchase a separate power charger for this camera. Its a) not avaialable, b) not necessary. Many users below are finding out that the available separate charger packs are not compatible with this camera. I talked with Kodak, they say a separate charger is not necessary. Just unplug the power cord from the dock and take it with you on the road. The cord will plug into the camera directly. Theres no need to bring the dock station while on a trip, etc. Separate power supplies are avaiable, but its not called a travel charger. Kodak actually did it right and made it easy to take this camera on long trips away from home....nothing extra to buy."
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"If you like blurry photos, you'll love this camera. If not, don't bother with it. It barely holds a charge, so you'll have to recharge it constantly. It also doesn't auto-focus well. I got it for a bargain ($50) and I still think it wasn't worth what I paid. Spend your money on a better camera."
5,great camera!!,"We got this as a gift for Christmas three years ago and love it!!I have not had to replace the battery yet!! Now to find the updated version,hope we wont be disappointed. We already purchased the C182 and had to return it a week later!"
2,Slow-moving disappointment,"The book consists entirely of character development; the characters don'tactually DO anything. For example, 80% of chapter six is an extendedflashback that occurs while the main character is having a drink. If theblurb about the mysterious death threat in the night leads you to expectsuspense, intrigue, mysteries, etc., you will be sorely disappointed. Read""Rich Man Poor Man"" by the same author instead."
5,A Special Operations Must,"If you plan on becoming a Navy SEAL, EOD, Air Force CCT, PJ or Army Special Forces this video is vital to learning propper technique for one of the most utilized strokes.I used this video with great sucess and its much cheaper than a swim coach and most swim coaches dont know or use this stroke."
5,Great Information,For anyone trying to lear the CSS on their own this is the perfect DVD to slow everything down and work on the basics. Then slowly bring everything together to become as efficient in the water as possible.
5,A must have for candidates...,This CD provided ALL the details you will need to become proficient at the CSS. I purchased it for my son who is going into Navy Dive School. It will help immensely for anyone needing to pass the PST for entrance into the special forces.
2,Bewitching?,"Somewhere, buried under my ancient collection and dusty records lies the second, infamous album Awake and Breathe. The artists,Bewitched have lost their spunk and merriness and traded it for a repititive, boring matureness . Buy their First album, C'est La Vie it is truly excellent. That's why I bought their second one because I thought it would be brilliant like the first, obviously I was mistaken. There are only 3 good tracks on the entire depressing drivel, Jesse Hold On, If it Don't Fit Someday. This allbum should be avoided, listening to fingernails scrape against a black board has proved far more exciting than sitting in your room being euthanised by this monstrosity!"
4,Pleased with new CD,"As a person in my early thirties, I suspect I am not the typical B'Witched fan, but I find them refreshing and fun.Having enjoyed the first cd even though it was not consistant, I was pleased with my first listening of Awake and Breath.It is much smoother and mature while retaining their obvious enthusiasm and love of their music."
3,Bwitched has been semi-successful in maturing.,"Bwitched's new album Awake and Breathe won't be exploding up the charts as their previous album did. The group has beutiful new instrumentals and an overall more mature sound. However, this new sound does not combine well with the very child like voices of Bwitched. ""jesse hold on"" the first single to be released of the album took some of the hit producing ingredients found ""Cae' La Wie"" spelling? I was hoping for more outbreaks into irish jig. That is really what made this group so appealing in the first place. But, instead I received an earful of trend hopping. The song ""My Superman"" is definately ""spicegirlesque"". Over all the album isn't that terrible to listen too, it just isn't that great either. Most of the songs do have a nice little hook to sing along with. If anything, you'll enjoy the musical/instrumental variety throughout the cd."
1,A disappointing set of songs,"I loved ""B*Witched"", the first album, so I decided that even though I hadn't heard the full length of any of the songs, I'd buy the CD. I wasted my money for sure. I like Jesse hold on, but other than that, the songs are akward and weird. And excuse me, but ""Red Indian Girl"" is definately a racial slure, besides that song making no sense. Overall, die hard fans are sure to like it, but they'd like anything. Us other people who liked the first CD shouldn't waste the money"
4,"Okay, I guess","Well,think they should grow up a little. Jesse Hold On is the only worthwhile song on the entire CD, and that needs a little work. I mean really, ""I feel good, I feel good, I feel good""? And they should have some lyrics that actualy have MEANING. It might be OK if I was 8, But I'm not. Word of advice:if you like Britney Spears, this CD is for U. Try Savage Garden."
4,"Pretty good, but Iiked the old one better","I liked thier old one better. Sure, this one has some good songs, like ""Jesse Hold on."" That was my favorite. If you liked Bwitched's old Cd, you will probably like this one. If you don't like them, this one does not get any better."
1,Terrible!,"Y'all need to stop putting ""no"" on ""Was this review helpful to you"". This music is nothing but trash!"
3,NOT MAGICAL,"OK LET ME GET THIS OUT THE CD DIDN'T [Stink]... BUT IT WAS NOT WHAT I ACCPECTED IT TO BE. I HAD SKY HIGH HOPES AND I MUST SAY I WAS FAR FROM AMAZED. THE FIRST CD WAS DEFINATLY THE BETTER 1. BWITCHED SEEMS TO HAVE DROPPED THERE OLD HIP HOPPY JIG JAGGY STYLE AND TRIED TO BE SOMETHING THEY COULD NEVER BE R&B ARTISTS. YES, BWITCHED R&B! SILLY HUH? 'JESSE HOLD ON' 'I SHALL BE THERE' AND 'RED INDIAN GIRL' SEEMED MORE FOLK THAN POP AND 'IF IT DON'T FIT' AND 'THE SHY ONE' WERE THEIR VERSION OF HEAVY MEDOL. IT WAS GOOD JUST NOT... GRAND. HOPE THAT HELPED. TO SUM ALL THAT UP I'D SAY HEAVY CONSIDERATION NEEDED :-)"
3,A treat for true Britney Fans,"Shortly before Christmas Time, Jive decides to release another Britney Spears Album to make a few extra dollars. That is truly the only reason this collection was released...Nevertheless, the remixes on this album are very dancy and club-worthy for the most part. This CD is perfect for any Britney fan, since this is the one and only oppurtunity to hear some of Brit's less well known songs in new versions. The new track ""And then we kiss"" is great and showcases a new ('80s inspired) side of her.Good Remixes:Me against the MusicThe touch of my handI'm a slave for you ( the best one on here )Everytime...Baby one more timeDisappointments:Toxic (no highlights)Breathe on me (similar remix on her Greatest Hits CD)Someday (originally a slow song and difficult to turn into a club jam)Don't let me be the last to knowThe CD packaging is poorly designed, too without any new (or old) pictues.Still, worth the money (when on sale)"
3,Nothing Special,"Most of the mixes on this CD can be found on previous releases. There is one new song on this CD, ""And Then We Kiss."" It's nothing too exciting, but if you like to dance, this is a good CD for you."
2,Vapid and Weightless,"I must admit I've taken a turn or two round the dancefloor to some of Britney Spear's many hits. ""Toxic"" in particular is quite thrilling. But the bottom line here is that while these tracks might pass while twirling around the disco in a drunken haze, with the mighty thump thump thump of a mega watt soundsystem in your ear, they certainly don't retain their energy or charm anywhere else. I honestly don't know who this collection might be geared to - club DJs will already have these mixes and casual fans obviously prefer the original single versions. This sort of disposable pop music is often by definition vapid and weightless (although for a time all the rage) and it seems Ms Spear's inexplicably extended fifteen minutes are just about up."
4,U.S Chart Position.,"I've already reviewed this album under the name of Angelic Devil, so if you want my review on the tracks, go there.Due to lack of promotion, B In The Mix: The Remixes, peaked at #134 in the US, selling only 14,077 copies in its first week."
5,It's Just Great,"I've written a review for a Britney album before and wrote quite a lot~ So, I've decided to sum up my feelings of this album in a few sentences. This album is purely enjoyable to listen to. I love the trancy-euro-dance-tech-pop style of this remix CD. It's so frigen awesome! I'd really recommend this album to ANYONE. Even if you don't like Britney Spears' music, you'll most definitely like this. It's a totally different feel from any other material she's done (considering it's all remixed). My favorite song is ""And Then We Kiss"". The new song. It is amazing. I just love it. The remix for ""Someday (I Will Understand)"" is also really great and fun. As well as the ""Touch Of My Hand"" remix. Thus, support Britney and get out and buy this awesome album. It's really great!!"
5,the best remix cd out there,"Toxic (10/10)Me against the music (10/10)Touch of my hand (10/10)Breathe on me (10/10)I'm a slave 4 u (1/10)And then we kiss (5/10) Not bad, slowly growing on meEverytime (10/10) Though this version is great, the version on her limited edition 2 disc greatest hits is much better though.Early mornin (8/10)Someday (I will understand) (10/10) Very nice and sweet song, i actually reccomend this version over the original.Baby one more time (1/10)Dont let me be the last to know (5/10)overall this cd is her best to date and not only that this remix cd is quite possibly the best remix cd to come around in years. buy it, its worth it."
4,a must for remix completists...even if it is edits...,"This is the only place you're going to get a near 7 minute Peter Rauhofer mix of Toxic, plus you get 8 minutes of the hex hector mix of Don't Let me Be the Last to Know, plus edits of a couple of other unreleased mixes. Track times:1. toxic (6:46)2. me against the music (4:01)3. touch of my hand (5:19)4. breath on me (3:55)5. i'm a slave 4U (5:51)6. and then we kiss (4:27)7. everytime (3:25)8. early morning (3:38)9. someday (3:46)10. baby one more time (4:38)11. don't let me be the last to know (8:17)"
3,Not really that great,Although its quite okay. I think that britney needs to divorce Kelvin. He is just bringing her life down the drain. He is such a rat. She needs to get over him and realise that he is what is making her unhappy. Go BRITNEY!!!
1,These tracks sound like mixes that were not good enough to make it on the original singles.,She must want more cash for diapers or something
1,not good remix album,"I'm sorry but I don't like this remix album, I think she has better remixes in her singles, and I really think the guy she is with we all know who is just using her for her money. and please britney don't ever think you can be better then madonna there is noway, madonna doe's sing live at her concert. I know you don't"
5,Are You In The Mix?,"This is the best remix album ever produced! Britney will be back in 2006 with a new studio album and this is an excellent hold over and I also suggest ""Greatest Hits: My Prerogative"" CD and DVD to all Britney fans or anyone who enjoys her music or videos! 5/5 Stars"
5,It's the Fantastic Record,"Yes, she's great. You're don't know that.She is the Princess of Pop, and soon: The Queen of Pop..."
1,Wrong year windows both times I ordered,"I Purchased TJ Windows and they sent me YJ Windows, So I cantacted them and told them the mistake, they fixed it at no cost, and did the same exact thing on the replacement order. Then I contacted again, They said they would fix it, then they just disreguarded what I asked for, and just refunded me. So aout a month of farting around, then they just gave up after two trys."
4,Mystery Mastery,Devour mysteries? I do. This and the other books in the series set in Revolutionary France are impeccably researched and keep the suspense high to the final pages. The characters and historical details are superb!
5,This book was a page turner !!!,"I don't want to give away the plot to anyone that might read this book, but I can say that I could not put this book down once I started it !The plot was filled with action and suspense, and it certainly never bored me. I enjoyed that it was hard to predict what would happen as the story progressed.I think this story would make a great movie and hope to some day see it turned into one !Kudos to this new author and I hope to see more suspense filled thrillers from him !"
1,False Advertisement,"The bottle is clearly marked ""Leaves hands feeling refreshed without stickiness or residue"" and that is just false. After the alcohol evaporates, the remaining ingredients stay behind as a sticky residue that has the consistency of mucus. I called the company to tell them about it, and they faxed me a document admitting that it does in fact leave a residue. Why do these bottles still carry false statements?What a better alternative? Just buy a bottle of 70% ethyl alcohol from your local pharmacy. It's cheaper, more efficient at killing germs and it doesn't leave any sticky residue."
1,"Poor quality product, unsatisfactory customer service","I bought this unit from VCT Company (Voltage Converter Transformersdot com). The customer service is not providing sufficient technicalassistance. The unit basically overheats. With an infrared thermometerI could read temperatures as high as 167 degrees Fahrenheit at thebottom of the transformer, even though there was no device connected tothe transformer. I could almost boil an egg there. I was afraid that theunit poses a fire hazard when left unattended for long time usage. Theunit is classified as a ""deluxe"" unit by VCT, however, it is below adecent quality. It is over-priced and does not meet minimumexpectations. Even without a device connected to it, there is adisturbing level of humming noise; much higher than the otherstep down voltage transformers of similar power output that I haveused in the past. Fire safety is a big issue. Stay away from the Simranbrand and VCT."
3,A funny read...,"This book is more or less a waste of time in terms of reading it as non-fiction... however, it has emense entertainment value. It reads very smoothly and Champ's braggadocio can't help but make you crack a smile. The guy's hilarious! The meat of the text could easily be summarized in a page or two, but Champ goes on to weave tales of how he came to learn the deadly arts within and how he used these forbidden techniques when angered beyond reason... I'm sorry, but it's really very funny (tears are running down my face as I write this)!As a resource, I honestly can't recommend this book and would probably give it only 1 star... but because of the lack of entertaining boxing fiction out there, I can recommend you borrow it at least to check it out. Good stuff, if read in the right light!"
5,It's a hit! Milkshake gets the whole family grooving...,"Play highlights on Milkshake's positive energy and charm. Turn it on and you'll turn it up- Milkshake gets the whole family grooving, hopping and singing along together. Any of the Milkshake albums, especially Play, is an appropriate gift for any child or young family interested in music. It's a hit!"
3,twinmom,"This cd is okay, but we (myself, my 2 year old twin girls, and my 11 year old son) love Milkshake's ""Bottle of Sunshine"" album, which has a lot more energy."
4,Work in progress...,So far I've been using this product for a month. I bought it for breakouts on my upper arms. The appearance of the breakout have faded and my skin is becoming smoother. I also use it on my face. I haven't had any breakouts since the first week. I use it every other day and hopefully within the next two month my arms will be blemish free.
1,Didn't work for me,"The Murad products didn't work for me, in fact it actually made me breakout more....."
2,Galaxy,"It works , I used this gel for about two weeks I didn't see results the first week I saw them on the second weeks of use,"
4,Another Fine Arctic Adventure Tinged with Politica Intrigue,"Icebound (The Jeannette Expedition's Quest for the North Pole) is not quite as exciting as the same author's, Leonard F. Guttridge, book The Ghosts of Cape Sabine. But this should still satisfy those seeking another chance to spend some time in an arctic adventure (even on this chilly winter days) and will only dissappoint those who seek a hint of cannibalism with their tale. This book has all the other usual elements of these stores, though, including betrayal, heroism, scientic stupidity, and, most of all, sheer perseverance in the face of insurmountable obstacles. This book also has a little political subterfuge to add to the mix. Another exciting re-addition to the polar canon."
2,"A tremendous story of human survival, however the author missed the mark!","I have read a number of books on exploration and Icebound is a very dull read on what could have been a very interesting story. The Ghosts of Cape Sabine by the same author is much better, however it is also not amoung the best books out there. Take my advise and skip this book and read a five star book such as In the Heart of the Sea, Into Africa, Frozen in Time, The Last Place on Earth, Skeletons on the Zahara, Mawson's Will, Captured by the Indians, Over the Edge of the World, Fatal Passage or Barrow's Boys."
5,From the trenches,Rawlings does a first-rate job of conveying elegant solutions to very arduous problems. If you find yourself in the trenches trying to bridge the technology gap between modern tools and older EDI or flat file based systems - this is your book. Those without the budget for a commercial product will especially appreciate do-it-yourself practical code and easy to follow examples.
4,relaxing music,This is a great way to tone down all the frustrations of driving. It is so enjoyable listening to it you don't even mind having to slow down in traffic jams. This was a lot less expensive than in some of the mail order catalogs you get. About half price.
4,Just what you expect from Windham Hill,"If you like Windham Hill music, this one's for you. A couple not so great pieces, but the rest makes for a relaxing and enjoyable afternoon."
3,Ya get what you pay for,Ok for an inexpensive spring loaded pistol. The spring seems weak for the proposed performance of the pistol. Next time I will save up for a metal model of the same gun.
1,POOR QUALITY VIDEO AND AUDIO,"THE DVD WAS OF POOR QUALITY AND WOULD NOT PLAY ONTHREE DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS. IT JUMPED, SKIPPED, ANDI COULD NOT WATCH BUT A SMALL PORTION. THE AUDIO WASTERRIBLE. VERY POOR. I DIDN'T GIVE MUCH FOR IT, SOIT WASN'T WORTH RETURNING. - KA"
3,Fairly enjoyable,"This game is *very* old school and is much like the original Sim City that came out on the PC. Compared to Sim City 2000 and upwards, this game is very simplistic, its graphics so and so. There's only a few things you can build besides the standard Resident, Commercial, and Industrial Zones, such as sports stadiums, police/fire stations, and seaports. Even at the fastest speed in the game, the process is actually fairly slow compared to the fast option in future SimCity games. If you're a fan of the newer SimCity games and want to go old school, you might enjoy this, but I definitely enjoyed SimCity 2000 better."
1,PC Version miles better then SNES versions,"not that this game is bad, but it is hard to play on Console, because PC makes everything so much easier for games like this. I would recommend playing this game, but on the PC not the SNES. 2 stars for this one."
3,"Okay, but Could Be Better...","I found this game to be inspiring, but it really doesn't cover all of the bases. The graphics are pretty good, and so is the sound. I just found that I would rather play this on the computer, rather than on the super Nintendo. It's not expensive, so you may want to try it, but I wouldn't exactly reccomend it."
4,"Search on AMAZON for ""The Healer""",You don't have to buy it used - it's available NEW as THE HEALER or Amazon B0002KQNN6.
2,This is Metal?!?,"Now, I'd like to say a few things: There's metal that's too noisy. There's metal that's too sparse. There's also metal that gets it balanced just right. For some reason, Forewarned generates an entirely new category of ""Sparse, but also too damn noisy"". Now, it may just be the recording, or it may be the musicianship, but the entire album seems to be rather... patchy. There's points where the vocals are rather weak-sounding, and in total the vocals don't at all seem to fit the type of music. The rhythm guitaring is weak and unimaginative, and the drummer could use quite a bit of work putting together a rhythm that actually coincides with that which the other band members are performing. All in all, a rather poor album. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, and I'm actually rather sorry that I purchased it. Just goes to show you what happens when you purchase something without having a listen to it first."
2,superfluous metaphor,"It is strange that a book dedicated to present deconstruction and chora actually ""plays"" of representing it. Derrida's reading on plato's chora is indeed relevant to architecture. It is not an easy reading, which is typical of many of derrida's writings. Unfortunately, this book becomes yet more difficult to read with this ""funny"" perfurated edition. Different from Deconstruction, it is not an easy task to interpret the meaning of those holes. They are certainly dispensable."
1,Try to avoid most of his other books too,"Unfortunately, I had to trawl through a good number of his 'books' for a school project. Among them are House of Cards, Diagram Diaries, Barefoot on White-Hot Walls, Giuseppe Terragni, and Eisenman Insideout. They are all terribly self-involved with his semiotic and 'metaphysics' babble. It is only by beholding the vast amount of twaddle he has generated, that I am convinced he truly believes in all this. Despite the painful reading sessions, I think we should simply lie back and feel sorry for him."
1,Can Eisenman get any dumber? You better believe it!,"Quite possibly the dumbest book about architecture (or non architecture to be more precise), if not the dumbest book about anything - EVER.Eisenman is, in the words of British Aesthetic Philoshopher, Roger Scruton, ""a pretentious twit"". This book, with its gimicky perforated pages, has more holes than Eisenman's logic. But, hey, if you want to seem pretentious and quasi intellectual, then maybe this might be the book for you. If you want to learn something about architecture, then try looking at the work of a real architect. But give this a wide berth. Until Eisenman produces a work of merit, he's fooling no one but himself and the few insecure ""intellectuals"" who don't really rate in smart society."
5,America's greatest literary critic,"Here are several literary essays from Wilson's final years and make excellent reading as literary criticism. One can always learn from Edmund Wilson, on any topic he writes about, not only literature, by the way."
4,geri halliwell on the cover need i say more!,geri Halliwell i belive is on the cover of this book. its very good because you can imagine the story line with her involved in it. she is a very beautiful girl!
2,Not that great,"I bought this gun and the Cressi reel that goes with it for freediving. I did not like the way the reel attached to the gun, it just seemed like a weak link and I was right. I shot four Spadefish and on my fifth one the reel broke right off the gun and away went the fish with the shaft 100ft of line and the reel. Straight to the bottom in 75ft of water. The fish only weighed 10lbs at most. This would be a decent gun for shooting really little fish and thats all. The bands seemed sturdy and it did shoot straight but if you are just getting in to spearfishing go ahead and spend the money now for a Riffe and be happy with a quality gun. I still have the gun as a backup but it doesnt get used much. Hope this was helpful."
4,This is a beauty!,"It's a bit early, as we just received this item, but we're very impressed! Made in Vermont, this is a beautiful, medium sized rolling pin, with a solid maple roller (on ball bearings hidden inside), and wooden handles. Terrific value for dollar on this item. Highly recommended."
5,Quality Vermont Craftsmanship,"Perfectly smooth and easy rolling. I was not sure whether to order this one or the longer model, but am glad I chose the medium length. Long enough for almost any task, yet short enough to fit front-to-back into my cabinets. Nice to see such a high quality product that is still made in America."
5,Great pies!,The rolling pin was a great weight. It made rolling out my pie crust very easy - rolling was a breeze. The pie crust came out very even. I would recommend this product.
5,Wonderful,"""Baila Habibi"" is a high voltage blend of Moorish-Spanish dance music sometimes referred to as ""Euro-pop"" by those insatiable for it as well as those derisory of it. What makes ""Baila Habibi"" stand out from the rest of the pack. Is the outlandish remake of the ultra new-wave British band New Orders' classic eighties hit ""Blue Monday"" into ""Cest toi"" by Mr. Cool/Maurice and Debra Fortunato. Perhaps less audacious but certainly as interesting are the fresh renditions of old favorites as ""Haila"" by Moustafa Amar and ""Elejigbo"" by Los Fernados. The latter can also be heard on the soundtrack to ""Wild Orchid' one of the few good things about that movie. Why purchase this or for that matter its sister album ""World Beat Zone"" when the hip-hop is enthused with flamenco trills and the raping is clumsy at best. Because its unapologetic unpretentious fun. Like all disco music it is guilty appreciated by those who regret the passing of the ""Los Lobos"" and the ""Gibson Brothers"""
5,World War 2 Flying Fortress,"Presents the aircraft as it was seen by those operating & maintaining it, exploring its combat attributes & deficiencies and showing why it became legend. Includes early employment by the RAF (and why this failed), Also disclosed are its clandestine operations with the Luftwaffe together with its last major combat use in the Middle East conflicts of the late 1940s & 50s, There is also a detailed study of the original crews & aircraft of a typical B-17 squadron & their eventual fates. Filled with original WW2 photos!"
4,Another Zimmer great,"Hans Zimmer does it again. The Last Samurai as a movie was sometimes awkward with Tom Cruise as the star, but the music fits in with classic action/adventure soundtracks. It's a bit odd in that the movie doesn't go overboard to feel ""Japanese"", but rather tries to convey music fitting for a warrior. The wailing score near the end, the final battle, is really eerie. Perhaps this soundtrack isn't quite as memorable as Gladiator, but it's worth owning for music aficionados."
5,The power of faith,"Sweet as lotus flower, strong as a the solid rock of the paith, sharp as a samurai sword... close your eyes and live in an magic ancient atmosphere"
5,Beautiful!!,I really enjoyed the movie. The soundtrack really intesified the moods of the scenes and brought out the passion. The soundtrac is great.
3,"Derivative, Pretty, Well Recorded","Zimmer cranks 'em out. Many of them competent, a share uninspired and technical. Granted he's come a long way since ""Burning Secret"" and the noise of ""Point of No Return"". Guess it was good Stanley Myers gave him a start, and Zimmer has made gazillions more than poor old talented Stanley ever saw. This score is lovingly recorded, AND its quite derivative of ""Last Emperor"" and""Little Buddha"" by Ryuchi Sakamoto, but any Hollywood approach to ancient Japanese culture is going to sound similar, perhaps.A lovely main theme. The ususal repetitive, martial build ups lushly recorded a la Crimson Tide. Alas, The Morricone Syndrome. Too many scores in one year.... it all starts to sound similar. Guess it's nice to younger ears who haven't heard many scores prior to 1990. Doesn't make it any less pleasant or well-executed."
4,"Zimmer Gains Honor for ""Last Samurai""","There will, no doubt, be comments comparing Hans Zimmer's capable score for Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" with other works, ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Gladiator"" come to mind. And there are elements of this score that do remind you of both. But there is much to be admired and enjoyed in this orchestral score. Zimmer offers a very introspective and melodic approach which may surprise some. There are dramatic cuts, as well, and ""Red Warrior"" is the best of these. Here Zimmer combines his thematic material with rousing Samurai chants for a moving climax. There are a few moments when Zimmer is a bit too modern, but they pass and are quickly overshadowed by better elements. Zimmer is also quite adept in this score at combining Japanese motifs and Western themes without overt stereotypes. Very well produced and packaged by Elektra."
5,Give this man another academy award,"Hans zimmer brings another excellent piece of work. Orchestration mixed with traditional japanese instruments and with a touch of synthesisers to bring this music alive. All of the tracks are my favourite. Highly recommended. I personally like Red Warrior with the background chants. You can tell that there are some parts from his previous work such as the thin red line, gladiator? crimson tide etc... basically all his best ideas from previous work to create his best piece for a long time. Get it if you like the Composer Hans Zimmer and his work"
3,Needs to be longer.,"Good music, but not enough of it. The moving passages should be stretched out or repeated. A 2-hour movie should have a longer sound-track."
3,"Music works in the movie, not as stand alone","Having watched The Last Samurai many times, I can anticipate almost every musical nuance in the film. I think the music flavors the film almost perfectly. So, naturally, I had to have the CD.However, as I listen to the collection of songs on the CD, I am left uninspired and disappointed. There are four songs I like very much, but even they don't totally work as a complete thought.Rather, each of the songs is like a bad paragraph with well written sentences.I think Hans Zimmer has done some tremendous work and I wish I had seen Cruise and Zwick acknowledge his contribution to the film's artistic elegance. (If they did so, I will stand corrected)Unfortunately, I don't think most of you who liked the movie and the music are going to be satisfied listening to the CD alone and out of context."
3,Haven't recieved it yet,I already know I like some of the tracks but being that my order has not arrived yet (a month in waiting) I cannot not critique on the entire track.
2,"Lots of great features, but didn't really work","This toaster has lots of appealing features. It stays cool on the outside and has several shelf levels. It is also the wonderfully easy to clean.But it took up a lot of counter space. I found that the oven heated very slowly and the thermostat never really held the heat at the right level. It took me 1 1/2 hours to cook a potato (which had been preheated in a microwave).I think it may have been defective, but decided to exchange it for a more expensive panasonic with a smaller footprint, so I'll never know."
4,Sykes still burns!,"I bought this in anticipation of that wonderful guitar tone that can be heard on Whitesnake's 1987 release ""Still of the night"". My wish came true. Sykes keeps it interesting throughout this work, showing he's a seasoned veteran while maintaining an overall modern sound. For burning rock guitar, he's THE authority."
3,There is a reason this guy is not a mega rock star...,"He has the chops, he has the looks, he certainly has paid his dues but...the songs just ain't there folks!Sure, this release thunders like the Mighty Thor, the players and production are sharpe, but in the end, the songs are just ok.There are nods to alot of influences throughout the tracks from Nine Inch Nails to Whitesnake, but overall this listener grew bored after only a few listens. Skyes could really use a writing partner and then maybe something truly great might happen. Alone, there is no one to tell him: that doesn't work, change this, try that...in other words he suffers from the solo artist syndrome that befalls so many artists who have no one to bounce ideas off of - they put out mediocre stuff and think it's great!...I will still check this guy out in the future, but will be cautious about buying him again."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a fan, so I usually love everything John Sykes puts out. We have all waited a long time for this one, and maybe the wait raised my expectations too high, or maybe I just like Sykes' music better when it is true to itself---lots of guitar, real rock. I'm not sure what this album is, except that its very dark and sounds more like Dr. Dre than John Sykes in too many spots. I know no artist wants to stick to a formula, and I applaud John Sykes for experimenting here, but it's just not to my taste."
2,Very disappointed,"Musically, this sort of sounded as if Korn went and got Sting to be their lead singer, with a few Sykes signature solos thrown in here and there (which actually isn't really a bad thing...). Another plus is that John can actually play very heavy and still sound silly, if that makes sense.What I didn't like: I just don't understand why everyone who tunes down and throws in some loops to sound like today's music (which, again, isn't necessarily a bad thing) has to also throw in gratuitous profanity. I wouldn't have expected it from Mr. Sykes. At the very least, slap the usual Parental Advisory sticker on the front so that people like me who don't want to hear it will be forwarned. Lyrically, this CD thoroughly annoyed me, and I'm going to try to exchange it today."
4,Not your '80s Sykes...,"When I first heard ""Nuclear Cowboy"" I wasn't sure what to think. I was expecting something more along the lines of Blue Murder. However, after spinning this disc a few times I've come to love it. It's edgey, bold and Sykes really goes out on a limb here. Sure, it may be a little overproduced and I'm still not totally hip on the drum loops and other effects, but it really has a great feel and who else plays like John Sykes? Talk about vibrato!"
4,ecletic finish,"These guys got it all. They got rock,funk,metal,pop.First of all I consider the first track a classic.The track So fine, is perhaps the weakest song of this album, nevertheless this is an album I recommend to the fans of Faith No More or Sugar Ray."
4,pieces of merrit,"My only problem with this release is that it is too short, only 27 minutes long. Way to short for us fans who have waited for a follow up to ""69lovesongs."" But that's a small complaint.This CD is an excellent sample of some of ""The Magnetic Fields,"" ""the 6ths"" past CD's. Also includes here are some new songs that are very good. These songs again are about love, being in it, falling out of it, longing for it. They follow in Stephin's writting tradition and classic manner. Only wetting my taste for a TRUE follow up to ""69lovesongs.""I have followed Stephin for many years and he hasn't let me down yet. If you have a taste for great song writing, off beat musical arrangements then this is for you. If your into formulaic top 40 music then by all means pass this by."
1,No figures available,This kindle version lacks the images for figures referenced throughout the book. It made it impossible to follow. This needs an update.
4,Price Reduced?,"I searched high and low for this product, and found it on Amazon. I placed my order and received my product in a reasonable amount of time. However, and this is a big HOWEVER, less than a week after I received my product for which I was charged $46.95, I received an email from Amazon telling me that this very product was now selling for $32.87. First, I'm disappointed that I paid full price and did not receive the discount, and second I'm disappointed that Amazon had to let me know after I purchased this item that I missed out on the sale. How do I recover the difference? Anybody's guess at this point!"
5,Fudge-y good!,"I recently bought theBreville BKC600XL Gourmet Single-Cup Coffee Brewer, which I love, and found a wide variety of 5 pack K-Cup samplers at Keurig.com.Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)was in the Flavored Coffee sampler and there's one word that says how I feel about it - YUM! I used the 9 oz setting, which worked well, and the smell coming out of the brewer was heavenly. It has a very rich chocolate taste that reminded me of brownies and fudge. I added a little Coffee Mate Vanilla creamer and a shot of DeKuyper Butterscotch Schnapps - wow! It was so good I could have drank three of them. Unfortunately there was only one, but there will be more in a few days when the two boxes I ordered arrive!"
4,"Great flavor, and not watery like some other flavored k-cups","I'm very happy with the two Gloria Jean's flavors I've tried (this one and Cappucino). So many of the other flavored K-cups come out very watery when you brew the larger cup size. Gloria Jean's are not too strong (I'm not a fan of Starbuck's style coffe), and not too weak. I'll definitely order this flavor again and look forward to trying some of the other flavors."
2,Good but gritty,"I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is wonderful(!), but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards."
1,Platinum Collection - Bryan Ferry,"I had not tried to download this CD until after the return date had passed. When I did, Disc 1 and Disc 2 would only download a few of the songs. I certainly felt cheated since half of the songs are not playable. I generally have received high quality products when I purchase at Amazon. This was highly disappointing. The limited time of the return policy prevents me from returning the purchase and this also is irritating. I will certainly remember this when shopping online again."
5,Glammy-Silky- Sexiness on a Cloud,"Imagine just coming from a really fabulous party, then diving into a pool of the smoothest, velvety chocolate... enough said.Kat NY,NY"
5,Old time crooner,Bryan Ferry has an old time crooner from the 1940's style! This had 2 cd's worth of great songs for a great price!
2,well researched but...,"While I appreciate the archeological material in the commentary, the content itself does not do justice the wonder of a miracle working God. Too much of the commentary is spent explaining away Go's amazing supernatural work and projecting human explanations."
5,Best Book Ever!!!!,"This book literally changed my life! Making Metal Jewelry is the ultimate outlet for the soul. Since buying Joanna Gollberg's book I've been able to kick heroin, loose 70lbs, forgive my parents for selling me, and find that special someone I've always dreamed of. Also, the fact that I've been able to sell most of my jewelry for an average $150 at The French Market in New Orleans ain't too bad either. So I guess I'm employed now too! No more soup lines for me! Thanks book!"
3,ok...,"i expect some good design inside... but this is a book about techniques, just like the book's name. I was wrong..."
5,jewelry rave,"This book is a must have for anyone who wants to create beauty with metals, but does not have safe access to a torch. I live in a condo, and had to find an available 'lab' whenever I wanted to complete a piece of jewelry.I have moved on to a new style of fabrication, and love it."
5,Making Metal Jewelry,"As a beginning or even as an intermediate metal-smith, this book is useful for demonstrating cold connections. The projects are easy to follow and they are easy to modify so you can put your own, individual touches to finished pieces. The gallery was inspirational and shows just how much you can do without having to resort to using a soldering torch and lots of messy chemicals."
1,cheap,this mobile is really poorly constructed and gets quite annoying. the wings constantly get stuck and fall off. the part that you screw to the side of the changing table or crib (we had our's on the changing table) is made of cheap plastic and cracked after about a month. not worth the money.
5,Adorable,My child loves this product. I actually have it mounted on a table next to my couch and is nice visual stimulation during feedings etc.
5,LOVE IT!,"We bought this for our 6 week old daughter for her changing table and she LOVES IT LOVES IT LOVES IT! Previously she cried the entire time she was having her diaper changed, but now she actually enjoys that time because of this inexpensive mobile. Well worth the money, and the butterfly is bigger than I expected so it really holds her attention."
2,Didn't like this,"I bought this for my twins for the changing table. Its cute and kept their attention, but it didn't clamp onto my table well, and it sits kind of low so we were constantly bumping the little wings off. So I put it on the crib and they kind of lost interest pretty quickly. They prefer their Rainforest Soothers."
3,Not bad ... but wings get stuck,"Well constructed, colorful mobile. My 2 month son enjoys looking at it on the changing table. My main complaint is that the 4 wings often get ""stuck"" against the body or the head of the butterfly and do not rotate fully around. The result is an interesting flutter, but I'm pretty sure this is not a feature, it's a design flaw."
4,gets baby's attention,i love the flutterbut with music as it always captures the attention of my now 10 month old....i put in along his playpen and he always smiles and looks up...he also loves standing and reaching for the 'wings' ...he manages at times to pull off the wings and play with them as the music continues to play. he loves this and so do we.
4,Possibly the best frisbee designed for dogs...,"My dog loves Frisbees at all, but almost all disc cause my dog's teeth to bleed out after several hard catches. So i look around for more dog suitable disc. I tested several ones, but this is absolutely flexible. No holes at all (used for two weeks now). The balance is quite limited due it is ""gummy disc"" but after few throws you will get the trick how to throw it straight or curved way. You can use it even in water. My other similar ""gummy"" disc always sink, this one not.So for me and my dog it is best option to enjoy the play outside with no harm."
2,Space invaders,"Game was defective when received. I guess being ""tested"" by the seller is not enough to ensure that the game works. The money was refunded, so I have no complaints about the seller."
4,Terrific sound -- one troubling glitch,"The sound on this little unit is fantastic! I don't care that much about disc capacity so I record at Hi-MD 256 kbps and it's virtually indistinguishable from the best CD sound.The trouble is that I bought this unit (instead of an IPod etc.) in order to make microphone recordings. It makes quite good recordings, but only in the ATRAC format. Although the SonicStage software promises to be able to burn a conventional CD it WON'T BURN recordings that you make with a microphone. In fact, you can't convert these recordings to WAV files at all -- so they're pretty useless until Sony comes out with a converter. I called Sony tech support about this and they have no idea when a converter will be available and they even refuse to try to find out. So until things change, DON'T buy this unit expecting to record anything with a microphone."
3,Software is awful,"If you want to record onto this MD using the microphone or Line in, don't expect to be able to burn a standard CD after.Sony software doesn't allow you to copy once you have downloaded onto the MD.My band can't burn a concert because of this,It is a good sounding unit though.The headphones shown in pic don't come with the unit, only ear pieces with crap sound."
2,Problems galore....,"I bought this product a little over a year ago, and was happy with it for a while. Then it malfunctioned. Sony duly replaced the unit. The unit went unused for a while and then once i began to use it for a while lo and behold, it malfunctioned again in exactly the same manner. As the unit is out of warranty and I will have to pay for the repair, I am now looking at taking my money elsewhere..."
2,Aptly categorized as juvenile Litterature,"As history this book falls far short. There are too many factual errors, assumptions and speculation to be taken seriously. Other recent books on thesubject would be a better investment."
1,Mine was DOA,Right out of the box the watch periodically stopped when wound. Usually when the second hand crossed the minute hand in certain positions. The hands appeared to get stuck - possibly contacting each other - you could move the watch and it would start running again. It would not keep time.
3,Arrived leaking everywhere in the box,"The bottle arrived and had leaked everywhere, though the bottle was not broken, so I kept it. Better care should be taken to packing the items."
4,"People, plants and animals of the Rainforest","This video is about the Manu Biosphere Reserve on the mouth of the Amazon river. Westerners researching giant otters, medicinal plants and parrots interact with an extended family of the Machiguenga Indian tribe that lives in the Reserve. The way of life of this tribe is a large part of the video. They are shown hunting, fishing, preparing food and just playing in the water. They also have a party when one of the Westerners is about to leave ; )...I don't know if this would hold the attention of children, it's more of an adult video. It has some freaky music, too!"
5,Excellent Film,"Saw this film while in Manu National Park in Peru, so wanted to buy a copy. It won two Emmysand remains one of the best feature documentaries on the rainforest that I've ever seen. Andinteresting mix of scientists, wildlife, and the native Indians who live in the reserve."
5,Cleveland Rocks!,"Here's a book for anyone who wondered why the Rock Hall was built in Cleveland. It chronicles the history of rock--the musicians, the clubs, the deejays, and the music media--in the Rock capital of the world. Ms. Adams'enthusiasm about her subject is obvious as is her attention to detail. Her writing style makes this massive tome a pleasure to read."
5,Great for students preparing for the ARRT,This book is an excellent tool for preparing for the registry. It contains all information and great reviews. Me and some of my fellow students bought it and we all passed with excellent scores
2,Mary,"Book is good for overall review, BUT I took the registry May 2004, and the book is no help at all! Registry questions are structured total different than material is presented. Over 40% of registry questions were not even covered in the review book. Save your textbooks, this review is a waste of money."
5,Michael W. Smith Freedom Sheet Music,I bought this piano music book for my daughter after listening to the Michael W. Smith Freedom CD. She loves the book and I love listening to her play the music! This is a beautiful collection.
3,Fun Game,"Game is fun except the answers are hard to read on the tv screen. It would be nice if you didn't get a wrong answer just because your spelling was off. Other than that, it is a lot of fun and is pretty much like the game show."
2,For Nerds,Good game but having to spell out the answers is somewhat difficult without a dictionary nearby. Good potential though.
3,Good book but spoilt by small print,"My first reaction when I eagerly opened this book was `what small print - can I be bothered to read it'. The introductory section in particular has a really small font size which, even with reading glasses, makes it a chore rather than a pleasure to read. Judging by the spacious layout on the pages, I am sure there was no need for the font size to be so small.Aside from this criticism, the book gives clear instructions, with lots of step by step photos, for creating four different styles of mosaics with polymer clay. It has a good introductory section on working with polymer clay and gives several projects for each style of mosaic. The Pietre Dure mosaics are definitely my favourite."
3,no noticeable difference,"I've been using this product for about a month or so because my dermatologist suggested I use a product with free radicles. Maybe this is not the type of product that you see a difference with, but I will continue to use it in the a.m. It does seem to be pretty moisturizing which is a bonus for my dry skin."
1,not worth it,"ok, so for the first four or five months i've had this cd player it worked great. but recently, it has been stopping, right in the middle of playing songs, not because i've pressed any buttons, but because it is extremely low-quality. i strongly advise buyers to get a panasonic player; their products meet every high standard."
5,ES LO MAXIMO EN SONIDO,"saludos desde maracaibo venezuelael equipo cumplio con todas mis espectativas, es mas.... quiero otro, estoy reuniendo suficiente como para adquirir otro de estos... lo he utilzado en cualquier ocasión y no da ningún tipo de problema... excelente producto a un precio increible."
4,Good things come in small packages (4.5 Stars),"The Sony D-EJ100 Walkman is a nice, if flawed, little CD player. It comes with all the features one would expect for the relatively small price tag; G-Protection (anti-shock), bass boost, programmable functions, on-line remote, CD-R compatibility and more.The unit itself is very thin and lightweight, but at the same time, quite durable. The button design is nice, with the basic play functions in the middle positioned around the display, and they're easily accessible too. However, the volume buttons, located on the side of the unit, are much too small. Speaking of volume, the headphones supplied with the unit don't carry much volume at all and they fail under high-bass situations, but they're okay for what their worth.Aside from a few volume issues, the Sony E-EJ100 Walkman is a great little unit with unbelieveable battery life (up to 50 hours!) Perfect for any music enthusiast."
5,great cd player,"this cd player has lasted great. i've had it for 2+ years and its still in pretty good condition. i've dropped it from about 2 and a half feet almost once every week and it still sounds fine. of course time has tooken its toll and the sensor is getting a little weak so its stops every once in a while, but its a small price to pay for such a great cd player. unfortunately they don't have it in stock right now in amazon, so get it somewhere else. it should only cost like 30 dollars. its awesome cuz you start off where you stopped last time. BEST CD PLAYER EVER! for rock lovers, get ""koss UR/10"" head phones. HEAVY BASS!"
3,Horribly Noisy Fan,"The CPU fan is so horribly noisy it's driving me nuts. It's a shame they ruined a good machine with a ten cent fan. The customer service solution is I ship the computer to them, do without a needed business machine for God knows how long, they will delete all the software it took me two weeks to load, and I guess I'll have to take out the hardware I put in it, and re-do all the cabling, and get it back after a long wait and re-do everything. For a lousy fan. I asked it they could just ship me a fan that was quiet but no deal. So they saved a few bucks on a fan, but lost a lifetime customer for emachines and gateway, and that includes the two thousand people on my mailing list that I will tell this tale to."
2,Cheap - in price and quality,"It's fairly inexpensive, so I can't complain too much. Themajor problem is the fan noise. It is so annoyingly loudand is on almost all of the time. I won't buy another eMachine."
1,"Solid machine, albeit quite noisy","This machine is loaded with all of the main necessary software and operates under Windows XP decently. My main complaint is the constant loud and annoying fan noise that drove me to distraction. I had to crank up the volume on music to not hear the fan. Playing music at normal volumes with any interludes of quietude are unreasonable. For this reason alone, I returned the computer.This is the second eMachine 'puter I tried after a span of about 6 years. Excessive noise on the prior one led me to return that one too. Maybe their more spendy models handle this noise problem better, but since price is what motivates most people to consider eMachine 'puters, why bother?"
1,Wrong description,"You know how it says under Product Description ""wild caught, product of Thailand""?Well, what it actually says on the can is ""farm raised, product of China"".I don't even feed my dogs treats that are made in China, there is a scandal after scandal about their tainted food products in the US. Can you imagine the risk you are taking with farm-raised shellfish?Currently awaiting my refund from Amazon."
3,Hard rocking but not new,"This album is a ferocious follow-up to the beautiful ""Loveland"" album. It features Sykes at his heaviest, which should be a welcome thing. While there are a number of songs whose melodies stick, Sykes has difficulty coming up with intersting or meaninful lyrics. Fans of songwriting are better served by ""In My Tree"" or ""Nuclear Cowboy."" John Sykes is still a wonderful guitarist and continues to get better on each release as a singer. What he needs is a songwriting partner."
5,Great quality but be careful of the color,"Testor Model Master paint needs no introduction, the quality is well-known. But be careful: Royal Air Force ""sky"" is not a blue, it is quite green. Much like a light duck green. Type the RGB values 182/196/171 in to your computer paint program to see the color. Even Royal Air Force ""sky blue"" is not blue enough for me; try Azure Blue. ADDED after some more experience: be sure to tighten the bottle screw cap very well to save unused paint ... this formualtion evaporated more quickly than others. -- Larry Rafsky"
2,"Mediocre, low satisfaction, big quality/design shortcomings","Main complaint: Sloppy, imprecise alignment of the two handpiece tips (plastic handpiece handle has lots of lateral wobble, making it hard to accurately contact both/all SMD component lands).Other complaints: Connecting cable not adequately flexible, easily melted on unintended contact with hot parts of the handpiece (a more flexible cable would make it easier to keep out of the way); Handpiece handles get hot to the touch pretty quickly - poor insulation.Handpiece looks like Hakko 950."
4,"dude, it's the shirelles",there's something super feel-good about listening to these recordings. i kinda bop along to them while baking in the kitchen.
4,Not a Bad EP,"Of the three Dispatch solo projects, State Radio is definitely the best so far. Chad is an excellent songwriter. This EP has a heavier sound, blending hard rock and a little bit of reggae. I like the political aspect of this band. At times it's hard to understand exactly what Chad is trying to say, but the lyrics have unbelievable flow to them. Worth checking out."
5,absolutely great,"this EP is the first from State radio, chad urmston's band along with bassist chuck fay and drummer brian sayers. the band currently tours and is fantastic live. other EPs such as Simmer Kane and Peace Between Nations are out now, but there are many unreleased songs which can be downloaded. (...)"
3,Where are the sinking pellets?,"This is a high quality feed and the fish seem to enjoy it.However, though it is supposed to be a mix of floating and sinking pellets, there are VERY few sinking pellets. I bought this food primarily for the sinking pellets and so was very disappointed."
4,Good perspective of the Conflict,Elusive Peace gives solid interviews with those who were involved in the efforts for peace between the Palestinians and Israelis. There is not much background info covered in the documentary but deals mainly with recent (1990-2005)developements in the conflict. Great dvd for those who have a knowledge of the conflict. Balanced and informitave.
3,"better than i expected, but not as good as i thought.","I must recommened this book to my fellow Amazonian book lovers out there reading my humble review. I wish to offer not only an opinion on the merits of this book, but a suggestion that you plunk down some dough and buy a copy for the house. Sure, you can get books at the library, even this one... but you will have to take it back eventaully, if you buy it here you can read it on an annual basis which is what i recommened in this case.read this one once a year to capture the real meaning of the story the lies hidden behind the well-crafted plotline. I have read this one seven times now and I am only just now beginning to understand the third chapter. _really_ understand it."
1,Beware of this scam!,"Beware of this false advertising scam! I ordered this toner cartridge which carries the picture and description of the genuine OEM article, but they sent a cheap ""compatible"" substitute!"
4,Joke's on me...,"I originally bought this game because i thought it would be hilariously bad. It seemed like a joke from one of the early Simpsons episodes. (much like ""lee carvello's putting challenge""). It turned out to be really fun. The music is awesome, and although there aren't many options regarding game customization, I found myself unable to put it down."
1,Lists only about 120 species; more suitable for the novice,"This was a disappointment: Be sure you understand that this is just an introduction to familiar species and not a comprehensive guide. It lists just 120 trees and flowers, but its design makes it easy to handle for quick reference. Note that this is not a paperbook book but rather, a 12-sided, accordian-folded laminated brochure which does not warrant its price. This is more suitable for the novice and not the serious naturalist."
5,The Amateur Outdoorsman,A very visual reference for any casual/beginner outdoors person. Great pictures and durability are only two of the great features... I will definately purchase more.
4,winch works as advertised,"I purchased this winch to wind 3/8"" cable and the only problem I had was how to anchor the cable to the spool. After using a cable binder, it worked like a dream. I'm using it to support hop bines for beer production, in an area that if it failed, would not cause any damage. So far, so good during the spring thunderstorms and general high tension winds. I expect this winch to last years."
4,"Review From a Baking Obsessed Stay at Home Mom,","this is great if you don't do yeast breads.i did one batch of pretzel dough and when i went to mix the beignet dough the next daythe engine burnt out.it's a bit heavy.easy to usecord comes off which is handythe bowls are beautiful, but heavy.and it's better at scraping the sides then the kitchenaide artison (says think)if you're a big baker of breads/dough etc get the kitchenaide PROFESSIONAL."
2,Sensationalism over substance.,"While the four subjects were evenly split between two decent people and two obnoxious loudmouths, the latter got quite a bit more screen-time. Rather than honestly showing how ""gay Republican"" isn't an oxymoron, something Newman and May might have been able to do if given a chance, the filmmakers instead decided to show Harris and Bonamigo endlessly making total fools out of themselves. I guess they decided that two intelligent human beings calmly and somberly discussing how difficult it is to battle the theocrats who have hijacked their political party isn't as much fun as letting a couple of self-righteous morons reinforce all of the bigoted stereotypes most gays believe about their more conservative brethren."
5,AnAwesome Bear for the hospital bed!!,Perfect gift for someone in the Hospital!!! Will order more of these Bears!! Keeps you from having to transport plants from the Hospital...
5,As the album title says!,This album is so groovy and funky! I just love it! Listening all day!Roy never disappoints us! great album. highly recommended :)
4,Great foreword thinking music,"This is an incredible album. While it may not be a classic or something that will stay in your player for years and years, it is an amazing album neither the less. Roy's combination of soul/urban hip hop and jazz goes a long way in here. The combination is silky smooth and doesnt ever really get hung up on jazz preconceptions. Roy does everything all for the betterment of the songs and its lyricism, never on proving artistic worth through long aimless soloing that is found a lot in this genre of music. Fans of mainstream acts will enjoy D'Angelo and Q-Tip's cameo's on this album. Overall this is a much more coherent album than most people would expect from this type of music. Also this is all coming from a huge fan/player of classic jazz...but this is one step forward and something the music needs."
4,"You Go, Roy!","4 & 1/2 stars. This project is a huge success all the way down to the packaging, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe jazz and hip-hop aren't so far apart after all."
3,Good jazz/funk/hip-hop,"I'm one of the older generation that will just never be interested in rap or hip-hop in their pure forms. But I do enjoy some artists who mix hip-hop with other music genre's, like Erakyu Badu and Jill Scott. I've also enjoyed Branford Marsalis' and Courtney Pine's albums mixing jazz with Hip-Hop. I love Roy Hargrove the jazz trumpeter. Roy's new album does a decent job of mixing hip-hop with some jazz flavorings. This is hip-hop seasoned with jazz (like Branford does it) rather than jazz seasoned with hip-hop (like Courtney Pine does it). A nice easy going album, no offensive lyrics. I think I'll like this the more I play it..like I did with Branford's Buckshot Lefonque albums. Kudos to Roy Hargrove for stretching and trying something new. For you hip-hop fans ready for more of Roy, check out Crisol and Tenors of our Times."
2,Hit&Miss,"I've been followign Roy Hargrove's work for quite a few years.it's funny how now that Roy is working with the Hip/Hop/Rap&Neo Soul Acts that suddenly He is Hip?I wonder where some folks have been having Slept on this Very Talented Brother??I think Roy waited to late at jumping on this Music Train.Branford Marsalis who I still Champion for His Virsatility has been doing this for a Decade&also Russell Gunn was rocking this Fusion of Rap/Hip,R&B&Jazz along with blending other elements into there music.Roy Hargrove is a Bad Cat but this feels too much like a Gimmick to me in some regards that is Hit&Miss with Me overall.I dig the Playing but alot of it is just missing some depth that I find in Older Roy Hargrove Albums.I dig D'angelo but I wasn't feeling the P-Funk Cover at all&when you Cover George CLinton&Crew you gotta bring the Pain&it wasn't there for me.but I give Roy Props for trying something different as to what He had been doing but it doesn't quite work for me on a whole."
5,Very well pleased with this camera,"The A200 by Canon is definately a great camera. Movies - The movies it records are very clear and smooth. I am using a 64mb CompactFlash disk so I can get tons of video on it.Photos - By using the Medium resolution (1024x768) with medium compression and using a 64mb CompactFlash card I can get 204 photos on it. That's 66 more than I got with the HP. The photos are very clear and crisp with this cam as well. And I love the ability to change the photo type (normal, vivid, sepia, etc...). I use the vivid so it makes the photo more rich and deep.Definately worth the price."
1,Make another choice...,"Canon makes some good digital cameras, but this isn't one of them. The main problem is that the camera takes too long to get it's autofocus in order before it takes the picture. More often than not, the picture doesn't take at all. You can't just point and shoot. The focusing takes several seconds, meanwhile the photo oppourtunity has long since vanished. Add to that the lack of optical zoom [the digital zoom is totally worthless since it lowers the quality of the final shot] and it's lack of features, and you are left with a camera which is no better than a disposable Kodak. Shop around, but don't put your pennies here."
3,Eats AA's,"This is my first digital camera and I received it for Christmas and am still learning to use it. The menus are confusing and it takes a long time to focus and shoot a photo while pressing the shoot button. The quality seems good though. During the first week I had it, I used 2 sets of AA batteries and took about 15 pictures. I then bought some NiMH rechargable batteries which seem to last much longer. I also did not appreciate the fact that no AC power cord is included and the manual continaully refers to using one while downloading photos to a computer to preserve the batteries. I used one set of batteries during my first download alone. Hopefully this will decrease with the rechargeable batteries and also now that I have figured out how to shut off the LCD during downloading."
3,"it's not horrible, but i wish i hadn't","i thought i did all the research. i thought i had picked the best camera. i'm glad that it wasn't me who spent the money. i got it as a gift.this camera isn't the worst one on the market, but i have yet to see why this camera would be beneficial over any other cameras. the worst part, i found, was how long it took to focus and how long it took to recharge after using the flash. not to mention the battery life was nearly non-existant, and the quality wasn't as crisp as i had hoped.words of advice: research more. if you want this camera for parties or fun times, maybe it's not the one for you. if you have the time to set up and rework your shots then you'd do fine. but this is not a camera for those in hurry to ""get the shot."""
4,Excellent Camera but...,"I bought this camera to take some pictures of my baby girl and I discovered that it's very very easy to use. Multilanguage menus (configurables), Excellent options such as a great zoom, Auto Focus (with Artificial Intelligence), etc.Such as this kind of electronic equipements this camera eats batteries... with a pair of AA Alkalines you can use it by 2 1/2 or 3 hour... No more... Without using the display...!Excellent for beginners...! I recommend you to buy the charger to this specific model... it longs the life of your batteries and can be rechargables...!"
2,Recycle time stinks! Choose something else...,"Overall, the A200 takes decent pictures. I've used the included software to send pictures via email, and I use an HP Photo printer when I want to print out pictures. Unfortunately, I have finally gotten tired of the S-L-O-W recycle time - that is, it takes forever for the flash to recharge and the lens to refocus after taking a previous photo. Groups posing for pictures have literally gotten up and said, ""Forget it!"" while waiting for my camera to finally take another picture. It is very frustrating!"
2,Beware of the flash,"I find that this is a great camera for taking pictures outside. However, while inside, the camera is pretty useless unless you're a foot away from your subject. In fact, the camera tends to work better in full darkness rather than in partial light. Often I find myself having to carry a disposable camera with me which I use for inside or nighttime pictures. Also, the flash cannot be turned off...I've tried. If you do manage to turn it off, the camera refuses to focus and your pictures come out blurry. In conclusion, spend the few extra dollars to buy a camera with a better flash...you'll appreciate it in the long run"
5,real nice cam for price,"...I thought [this] was a good buy this is a nice peice of equipment. The only things I would like better about the cam is when you record movies. One is that it dont record sound, second you cant zoom when recodring a video, and finally third it only records for 10 seconds at a time. It does a good job for taking pics which it what a digital cam is for so it does its job the whole video idea is a bonus deal anyway. It is a geat cam for its price belive me. Has nice high quality pics."
1,Please Dont buy this!!!!,"My dad got this camera free about a year ago. I finally learned how to step the camera up. I had to read the whole manual to do so. So far this camera has been horrible. It takes forever to focus, and the batteries run out after one day. If you have pets or small children this camera is not for you, because it takes to long to take pictures. ALso this camera comes with 2 MP. SO you can only hold up to 8-10 pictures at once.SO if this is your first time buying a camera make surw you dont buy this one, because even though it takes good pictres its just way to slow."
5,Canon PowerShot A-200 Digital Camera,"This camera is an excellent, fast camera. It takes pictures, and movies. It is an excellent starter camera. If all you want to do is take pictures, or videos, this is an excellent camera for you. The only 2 downsides are:-It is ugly. The A-10 look a lot nicer.-It is uncomfortable. It's just a cube.These 2 downsides have nothing to do with the performance. This is a great camera for the modest budget, or for a beginner."
4,Fusion From Japan,"The Amazon review on here is for another album and these guys are not French. They are: Hiroaki Itoh on Keys, Astunobu Tamura on guitar, Roichi Iwai on bass, and Ichiro Fukawa on drums. They can all play and this is some real good fusion with a mix of jazz and progressive rock.Track List:1. Another Encounter (9:31)2. Thus the Song Passed Out of Their Mind (9:46)3. Play it Cool (6:10)4. Go Together (6:01)5. Space Forest (9:14)6. The End Of Tears (9:24)The songs range from progressive rock similar to a Hatfield and The North or National Health to classic progressive fusion like a Brand X or Bruford. Fans of these band should like this one and it is worth exploring Japanese fusion bands like these guys. I give it 4 stars and if you have read this far God Bless You and pick this one up, you won't be sorry."
1,Spend your money on something else,This game ain't good. it's not worth the dollar it costs. spend your money on something else. 1 star.
2,It was great ... while it lasted. Terrible support from Dell!,"I loved my Axim X-30 high. Didn't know how I'd ever lived without one. Read books, watched movies, checked my e-mail on the go ... wonderful! However, after owning it for a year and six months (thus out of warranty), I turned it on one morning to be greeting by a solid, white screen. Hard and soft reset had no effect. Switching batteries didn't help.Then I discovered that Dell charges you $39 just to TALK to someone who can initiate the repair process on an out-of-warranty item. There's no place to take it or send it in. You have to go through the phone number that charges you up front before you can even talk to someone about repairs. That just doesn't seem right to me, and I'm disappointed at how soon my Axim (which was very well cared for and never dropped or roughly handled) stopped working. Complaints to customer service just get me canned responses."
4,Very good ppc,"Very fast, dependable OS (way better than the wm5), good buttons, nice scroll device, good battery life, bt and wifi works very well, the only glitch is that it would be nice to have a better screen, other than that is nearly perfect."
2,Nice look...if you don't want to read the clock,"This clock radio was very nice looking, but the slanted screen provided a lot of glare from any light that was in the room during the daytime. I sent mine back."
1,Don't buy it !!!!,"I purchased a Friedrich C-90A Electronic Air Purifier for my son's bedroom. He has allergies, and I thought this would help him.Less than 20 minutes after turning on the machine, the bedroom was filled with ozone and my son complained of a sore throat.I telephoned Freidrich to inquire as to how to control the ozone generation. They informed me to direct the air flow towards a wall and the ozone would dissipate. It didn't work.No matter what I did, there was a strong smell of ozone in the room.My suggestion is don't buy this product as it is dangerous."
2,Good for 1 year,"Hi,My C90A was great for about 1 year. Now it sparks or arcs constantly with a very loud snapping sound when ever I run it. I am not sure how to clean it to get this to stop and Freidrichs was no help at all. I would have done a lot better buying a HEAP air cleaner."
4,a good buy,"a good, rugged speargun. fast and accurate. fish cannot out run it. a bit difficult to pull the sling back underwater, requires a good amount of effort. very easy to reload the shaft and line. fish come off spear easily (but only when you want them to!) has a good safety switch, easy on and off."
2,No pizazz here. No loss that it's lapsed out of print.,"""TSL"" is VERY elementary. It reads very much like a textbook or operating manual. It offers many evaluative instruments for students to do self-assessments of their comprehension of the material Murray covers here. To that extent, ""TSL"" smacks of a ""teacher-proof"" text. The field of leadership studies is much too exciting & dynamic to be conveyed via such a tepid, pedestrian approach. I'm a leadership educator of high school students. Unfortunately, I found very little of value here for either my faculty colleagues or adolescent students themselves."
4,Excellent as a text book for beginning college leadership.,This is an excellent for educators working with either college or high school students. The book is designed as a practical text for beginning leaders. The focus is on self discovery and communicating with others.Excellent as a text or a source for designing lesson plans or workshops.
5,A rockabilly/psychobilly gem!,"Being somewhat of a newcomer to the rockabilly/psychobilly scene, I had to roll the dice on several purchases including this one, based on hearing only two of the cuts previously online. Of the 14 cuts on the CD, I liked 12. Three of the best include: I'm your Zombie, Grave Digger, and Switching Heads. I also bought their ""Blood, Sweat and Nitro"" CD, which is also good, but I consider this one the best of the two."
2,GLAD THEY WERE RIGHT,"WELL, thought these were suppose to be drilled and slotted rotors but when i opened they are not.....the picture is kinda decieving....I'm just glad they fit my truck"
4,You'll miss out without it!,"While bulky and ubiquitous, this tome is a must for explorers interested in getting more out of their journey.One thing that's worked well for me is to prepare photocopies of key pages from the guide in advance (especially the maps) so that I can keep them handy while travelling light!Anyone know how different this new edition is from the previous one?"
5,Complete acquaintance with Varanasi and its special places..,"The insight into the tourist attractions in a place like Varanasi has been carefully illustrated. The authors seem to have taken a lot of pain to satisfy the tourist's spiritual and traveller's instinct.Special mention must be given to the ""Yoga Clinic and Center for Meditation"" where Guruji Shri Prakash Shankar Vyas blesses and graces the wandering, restless, inquisitive mind. I personally visited him and have been associated with him since then for the meditation taught by him stands a world apart from the rest of the institutional claims that we come across in various parts of the world. The most remarkable feature here is the belief of achieving your goal on your own and not through any so commonly pronounced magic. For all those who wish to know in this area this place is the temple of understanding and experimenting till one does not realize his aim. Edword."
2,Terrible sound quality,"I love George Smiley stuff, even when it does not feature Sir Alec, but I have not been able even to finish this DVD to the end. Even with the volume turned up fully on my Gateway laptop and ear phones plugged in, the dialog is virtually unintelligible much of the time. I have noticed this problem with BBC productions on DVD over the years, although their content quality is almost always excellent. Customers with laptop speakers or no separate speakers may want to be cautious about this product, but only for that reason."
2,NEITHER CLOSED CAPTIONED NOR TITLES,"IF I'M WRONG I'LL APOLOGIZE, AFTER LEARNING HOW TO OBTAIN CLOSED CAPTIONED. My TV set has never failed to display CC or English Titles, but on this DVD it doesn't. There is no ""language"" set-up option."
4,Confusing For One Who Hasn't Read the Book--But Good,"I must admit I watched this because Netflix had it listed under Christian Bale movies, and I had not read the book. It was not exactly what I had expected. I was looking for something more similar to P.D. James The Black Tower (I think that's the one--it begins with the body of a student found on the beach) or Josephine Tey's To Love and Be Wise with much more of the students involved. As I'm not familiar with most of the actors aside from Bale, Denholm Elliott (whom I love in the Indiana Jones movies!), and Glenda Jackson, I was a little confused as to who the characters were and their roles in the school's heirarchy. However, the acting was outstanding (and Bale was beautiful!) and the plot was interesting. I must say, though, I prefer Agatha Christie, P.D. James, and other British mystery writers."
2,what's going on?,"a totally no-big-deal murder case. what we saw was bunch of brainless chain-smoking detectives pollute the crime scene; a very basic storyline that would have involved the sabbatical g. smiley.a very lame story adapted into a lame and boring movie, wasted a lot money and talents. typical bbc for pbs viewers who adore british stuff no matter what. but fair is fair, good is good, bad is bad, and this is a very bad movie, unless, of course, you don't mind to waste couple of hours to evolve and maintain in a couch potato status."
5,Very good portrayal of George Smiley,"I wasn't sure how I'd like an actor other than Alec Guinnessplaying George Smiley-but Elliott does a fine job.As otherreviewers have noted,the plot doesn't concern spies this time.As usual,it may take 2 or more viewings (or reading the book)to appreciate all the subtle points being made (talking alwaysexceeds action for Le Carre)-but this is a big plus for me.IE the performance can be enjoyably viewed many times.If youlike this one,you should view the 2 Guinness portrayals ofSmiley."
4,A must for John le Carre fans,"This is a good adaptation of the book, but Denholm Elliott, though a fine actor, is no Alec Guinness when it comes to playing George Smiley. If you can get over the fact the Alec Guinness is not George Smiley, this is a good murder mysterywith a good plat and fine acting. It was interesting to see Glenda Jackson in a movie that is dated just a few years before she became a member of parliament."
1,Boring,"Somebody else wrote a similar review and I didn't believe it. Too bad for me. It was true. There was no zest to this movie, it didn't do justice to the cartoon."
4,really fun,thought this was a fun book with great ideas. waiting for the opportunity to make one of the designs. Especially like the pole dancer cake.
1,Buy Seriously Naughty Cakes Instead,Be aware that Seriously Naughty Cakes provides all of the exact same information and designs that are included in both Naughty Cakes and Xtra Naughty Cakes. It is simply a rebinding of the other two books. Don't waste your money on this book but get Seriously Naughty Cakes instead to get more for your money.
3,"Nothing new, but might be a ""must-buy"" for Solara fans","This is a very short book that is designed to ""invoke your celestial guardians""...just as the title suggests. This book is mostly poetry that is done in the traditional Solara way and it could be a must buy for Solara fans who just can't get enough of her. It is all about anchoring with oneness and leaving duality behind, but there aren't any new revelations that Solara endows upon us. If you've read at least ONE of her books, any of them, then you've pretty much read this book too.To me, this book seemed to just receit the same mantras over and over again with poetry thrown in every other page. I would suggest getting Solara's ""11:11"" or ""Living Large on a Small Planet"" before this. It's not that I don't like Solara...because I do, it is just that the information in this book can be aquired with her other books in greater detail....and you still get the same message."
5,"For my taste, O'Reilly cooks the best books!","I own several O'Reilly Nutshell handbooks (HTML, Perl, JavaScript, Java, etc.), and as far as I'm concerned, they're simply the best. I love the design, the structure, the readability, and everything else. When I want REFERENCE, I get O'Reilly. And JavaScript: The Definitive Guide is one of the best in the series. The only other JavaScript book I'd get is Netscape's OFFICIAL JavaScript 1.2 book (and that's just because David Flanagan hasn't completed his 1.2 edition)."
4,I beg to differ. Get this and Netscape ONE Developers Guide,"JavaScript the definitive guide is a reference resource. As a reference it really doesnt help you understand the intracacies of programming JavaScript. I use this book when I need a quick answer to a something like syntax, properties and methods. As a reference this book is very useful. However, to solve tough problems, get hands on help and work through the logic of programming scripts, I rely on Netscape ONE developers guide.Take it from someone who develops scripts every single day: You need a good reference book and a good practical-handson book"
2,Hated every minute!,Not much food for thought... More of an outline/overview than what you actually need to master JavaScript. Flanagan's style is a bit sketchy as well
2,not impressed,personally i am not impressed by this book. i have been doing java for a year and because i am from a programming background i was able to appreciate the chapters on data types statements and so on. But I was all the time thinking if I was a beginner then this material would not be easy to take in. I became stuck on the chapter on objects as there is a little mention of things such as Document Object Models which is an important part of javascript. After looking up this stuff on the web I am more comfortable with it. Overall my feeling is that this book does contain a lot of stuff but has not been put together in a good ordered fashion. Thums down I am afraid
1,Low-brow juvenalia,"A series of poorly-detailed cliche characters, awkward sentence construction, terrible plot flow and weak endings characterize the first two novels in this omnibus, and it doesn't get better. The world is crude and never properly explained, the antagonists are cartoon villains with (yet again) unexplained motivations to do evil, and the writing often repeats itself in an attempt to keep the narrative straight. This is clearly low-brow ""young adult"" fantasy, with none of the wit of a Fritz Leiber or the brooding passion of a Robert Howard, and is to be avoided."
1,Not So Much,"It is dull. It is overly simplistic. It has nothing to recommend it. Listening to it is the musical equivalent of drinking sugar water. But then again, I know people who like sugar water."
2,No pizazz!,Pretty ho hum good for the elevator or maybe in between Perry Como at the resturant!!! Maybe if you had a terminal illness you could play this album to hasten you along!!!
1,No More Old School Madden's outdated and not fun,these old Madden games are boring can't believe I used to play them. 1 star.
3,Great game....for its time,This game features the best that snes can give you but not worth getting anymore. the new games that madden has on other systems blows this one away. the game is fun to create players bbut i cant seem to get passed a 70 on the 40 yard sprint. overall this is a relatively good game but i would reccomend saving up for some of the big systems and games.
3,NOT for U.S. use? Partial install.,"In case you are wondering, the two objects on the right are (top) bendable tubing, and (bottom) a rubber air scoop. Directions would have you open the small plastic hatch under the engine (driver's side, US, secured by a screw) and install the rubber thing [sticking out and air routed up thru the bendy hosing to the filter] to get cold air in.However, I found there was no room for the bendy tubing on my 1999 Miata Base Model on that side (Power Steering/AC stuff in the way). Had I known this, I'd have just bought a K&N; cone filter (like included) and done my own routing. Seems the claims that this was not designed specifically for the US market are specifically correct. Kit uses the stock black rubber intake tubing that crosses the front of the engine, too. Bad for O2 in hot weather."
4,best version of Family Feud at the time,"This 1993 edition (SNES, Genesis, and PC) of Family Feud was the best version of Family Feud available anywhere (much better than the NES version and the C64/Apple II Sharedata versions). Great graphics, great music and sound effects, and great gameplay (hey, it's Family Feud, one of the best gameshows of all time)! Now if somebody would make games based on either ""The Price Is Right"", ""Match Game"", or ""Whew!"" (oh well, there's always the opportunity to make Atari 2600 homebrew games based on those <g>)."
1,"watch the tv show, don't play this crummy game","I am big fan of the show Family Feud, but this game is just unbearable. the question they ask are retarded and the whole game itself is cheaply made. avoid at all costs. 1 star."
5,Honesty From The Soul,"This is a very personal book. There are times when I read sections of the book and think...this is too much information, I should not be reading this. This is an honest account of a life.It's a great book about Truth, Beauty, and SASHA!"
4,"Dial M for Murder, is right","These AZ cats are straight MIC murderers, from the track Dial M for Murder to Hardcore. All the tracks production is dark and dirty with seriously deadly lyrics. Also, try to download their song Ivory DISS, while they rap over the High & Mighty's E=MC2, its dope, nah it's MURDA......PEACE."
2,wait for the instrumental album,"Divide this into a couple of categories: beats and lyrics/concepts. Concepts wise this comes really close to being the biggest rip off of Wu tang and Gravediggaz I ever heard. The beats are good, but the lyrics and concepts are so contrived and un natural. Not to mention, the shock value which isn't really shocking as it is irritating tires on those of us over the age of like 15. Also those of us who remember Wu tang recognize this bite immediately. One of the thing that made wu tang so immense is that they were REAL. Even with the alter egos and martial arts stuff, there was an undeniable authenticity to them that is totally absent here. It doesn't work."
3,Stylized Satire,"I am once again rereading Main Street, the classic of 1920's American life in the Midwest written by Sinclair Lewis. Having grown up in the Midwest (in the 1950's) I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about this subject. While I recognize certain aspects of my home town in Lewis's fictional Gopher Prairie I miss other things. The good things. The better side of life. Oh, it is there in Main Street, but Lewis too often uses his acerbic wit and sly satirical style to skewer the foibles of the little people with little minds in his fictional world. Do they exist? Sure they do, but you do not have to look too hard to find them in the urban metropolis as well. I think Lewis's skewed view of life in Gopher Prairie is a symptom of a bigger problem that he has. His view of mankind is slanted to focus on the dark side and results from his naturalistic style. My world is brighter, filled with heroes and hope."
1,Bad return policy,Found out this memory stick doesn`t work with my other memory stick (same sticks) Wanted to return it but because I misplaced the pastic sleeve(had everything else) they would not accept it. I think they should be alittle more flexible.
1,Young poems by a young poet.,"After reading the first lovely poem in this book, I was disappointed to find page after page of an indistinct, vaguely expressed voice. The overall tone is quiet and delicate and while there are moments when a gentle lyric almost shines, for the most part this is a poet who has yet to distinguish herself. It is clear that Syzbist is still under the sway of her influences -- early Jorie Graham, Emily Dickinson, Fanny Howe, Wallace Stevens. All great influences. However, rather than depend on the work of her teachers to lead her poems, this young poet needs to use her hard-earned study to find her own direction."
1,Way too big,"I know ball gags are supposed to be big, but this was way uncomfortable. And the straps scraped my face. Difficult to explain to coworkers Monday morning, you know. I would not bother with this one at all, splurge a little on something better. Even though you want to be punished, you don't deserve this!"
5,Great For Beginners,"I read the reviews, but figure I would give it a chance. The one negative review about it leaving marks almost made me turn away. But I gave it a shot. My girl loved it. Highly recommend this item for anyone who was thinking about trying new things. Oh and no marks."
2,Not what I would suggest for beginners or most women.,"Not what I would suggest for beginners or most women.The ball is very large, making it less fun for the beginner and especially hard or impossible for proper use with most women. A larger ball will make the jaw tire and hurt faster (if you can get it in the mouth at all)The webbed strap material can easily be abrasive to the sides of the mouth. The straps should be much thinner or something without abrasive edges.On the plus side, it's very inexpensive, and I do like the ball material even though its cheaply made."
3,Get what you pay for,"This ball gag uses rings instead of buckles, so it has a little more trouble staying on. It also seemed bigger than a ""beginners ball gag"" should be. I was expecting a 1.50"", but this looked more like 1.75"". It wasn't expensive, so I can't complain too much. I just would've wanted something a bit smaller to start with. Overall, the product is worth the price, as long as your mouth is big enough to handle it!"
3,dont have it on too long cause... smells after 5months,"its a great product i liked it a lot but if its on to tight it well make a grove on the sides on your mouth that well kinda hurt later on but other then that it looks sexy as hell though.. lol and have had it for about 5 months now and starting to have a bit of a smell to it now and i tried to clean it with many things and not to much of a change, have to keep some plastic wrap on it for the smell sometimes, so up too you if you would want to buy it.... i mean other then that its a nice gag for the price as well i would rather give it a 3and a half stars.i prefer getting a little more expense one thats more decent but for the price you really cant go wrong.. just wish i had a partner to share the experience with me:P"
1,"Ball good, straps useless!","The ball is a good size, does not smell bad at all and has no foul taste. The strap snaps broke just in trying it on, they are super, super cheaply made. I had an old strap from another toy that I was able to custom fit and now it works fine. So if you just need the ball and are willing to construct your own strap, go ahead and buy it. If you want it ready to go then look for something with a quality strap."
3,ball gag,The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is too big. Not for small mouths. But on the plus side it has no taste or rubber smell.
4,Be wary,"I have to say, this ball is worth the money. It fills my entire mouth, making it impossible to speak (or even attempt to do so). The downside is that is doesn't fit my girlfriend, not even close. If you have a fairly small mouth, you will definitely be unable to wear this. The sides of the strap are rough and causes friction on the edge of your mouth, but it is endurable even for over an hour (and red will disappear in a few mins). To me, it just ADDS to the experience. If you are expecting a ball the size of a table tennis ball, you will be disappointed because it is very big."
2,Read the size,"Be sure to read the size dimensions! I can't get the gag into my mouth and haven't found anyone else who can. It's a cute item, but not very practical."
2,Huge.,"It is what it is... a ball gag. It is way to big for most though, unless you have a snake jaw. I've got an average sized mouth and it's excruciating, my girlfriend can't even get it in her mouth at all.FYI - It's big."
1,too big,way too big for my girls mouth tried to cram it in but could only get the thing half way there. dimensions or a reference to size needs to be listed
3,Adds some spice ;),"my gf and i are into light bdsm. I am usually very dominant and when she is being ""punished"" this gag come in handy! it doesn't really restrain her moans or screams, or even words, but its the look and impression it gives off. she said she loves it, and it makes the evening very hot. my complaints as ones that other reviewers have witnessed. the uncomfortable strap and the metal pieces pinch at times. last is the gag itself, although it is fun, gag it does not do nor eliminate speech (or sounds). she said she would like to try one that goes further in her mouth. i guess until we find one that we both like, this, and sex tape will have to do"
4,Great Quality,High Quality. Got here super fast. Works for an accessory or as a toy. Very happy with my purchase. The one small issue is it says beginner ball gag on the box. But it's really rather large.
4,ok,"I like it ,it is a very nice ball gag, a little larger than my other one, but mouth filling, which is great, oniy one problem is , it does not have a regular buckle, it has 2 'D' rings that you have to use, I figured out how to use, all ok ,now, a good product."
1,Caused Intense Jaw Pain,"I studied all the reviews I could about this product and saw that this was an issue. Unfortunately I took a gamble because a lot of people said ""it wasn't that big"". Allow me to clarify... IT'S BIG and IT WILL CAUSE PAIN (in a bad way). Look, I'm a male with a larger mouth and it caused weeks worth of jaw pain for me. I highly regret getting this item and will probably never use it again. So do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,Horrible,"I'm a big tennis fan and have played a lot of the tennis video games. For SNES, this game is horrible. I play super tennis and jimmy connors pro tennis a lot and they are great. I bought this, tried to play it one time and it was literally impossible. Horrible game, horrible graphics, ball is half as big as people, it sucks."
5,Theory and practice ? Excellent and amazing!,"This album sound really good. I love their riff and melody. Every song start like an explosion ... its fast and really technical. Just try to listen to one song from them, you'll be amazed.Cette album est excellent. Les passe de guitares et les mélodies sont exceptionnelles. Les guitaristes de ce groupe sont de vrais professionnels. On s'en rend compte avec les riff plus rapides qui sonnent vraiment bien. Les solos ne sont pas placés n'importe où et contribuent à créer des chansons qui surprennent tellement elle sont bonnes! Bref, pour les amateurs de métal technique et progressif !"
5,why not - another review,"im reviewing this because its the most recent, but not the best. it is excellent. 'armegeddon theories' is probably the best,-certainly the most technical and complicated,- UNBELIEVABLY so. my stongest attachment pobably lies with the first- 'third eye function', which is still ridiculously accomplished, contains my favorite production, and probably has the strongest MESHUGGAH connection."
1,Get the MZNHF800 instead,"Even though the 800 doesn't have a backlight, it has a radio, and uses a single AA battery instead of the dorky proprietary Sony NiMH + screw-on single AA battery adapter on the 900."
4,Great recorder,"Having ""been into"" Mini-disk since it's onset, years ago,I still have the org ""portable"" recorder. & still use it some.Anyway, I am very, very happy with the 900 Hi-md. it does so much, & I am very pleased with it. the only thing I WISH it had that the old units do, is an ""instant track mark"" button/ switch on the unit. It would make incerting track marks sooooooo much eaiser. The digital pitch control makes it a great music study recorder. If you have ever used a recorder to study music, you'll LOVE the nearly unlimited space & quality of the sound. the stereo make repeated lisening much more joyfull & easier on the ears, esp when you are trying to LEARN a piece.Aside from the track mark, & the fact with hi-sp you can get over 7 hours of QUALITY audio on ONE disk.... It's amazing... Just goto Eruope, Japan, etc... Minidisk is all over.. You can got to a ""7-11"" & find mini-disks..."
4,so far so good,"My husband and I are taking a long hike [...] in segments and I need to have a strong reliable backpack. I tried the Lowe Alpine Bear Tooth 45 pack, but the straps ripped out twice. So I received a refund and was advised to try this pack. Even though it is supposedly smaller I took the same amount of gear with no trouble. The pack was comfortable, it fit me perfectly, there are many sizes from extra small to extra large, and so far nothing has gone wrong. I'll rate it 5 stars if it is still intact after several more legs of the hike."
4,A Bit Dated but Authoritative,"Who, What, Where, How? If it is related to photography, it is in this book. Well, almost.The current edition of the book is a bit dated, originally published almost 10 years ago. Not surprising, it has little about digital photography. Perhaps an update is in the works -- the author's ""Basic Photographic Materials and Processes"" went into a second edition recently, with a major update on digital processing."
5,Stout Irish Music!,"I was introduced to Amadan by accident when they happened to be playing at the bar I chose for my 21st birthday bash. I fell in love with the music instantly and, several months later, I managed to purchase this CD. It spent a solid month in my CD player and somehow manages to get wedged in it every so often these days.Like Celtic music? Like punk? Like rock? Heck, you don't even have to like any of these genres to love Amadan. They're one of those rare bands where it doesn't matter what your taste is, you can't help loving them. This CD is an excellent blend of traditional and original (that manages to sound traditional, but punkified) music that will always put a smile on your face.Buy this CD andraise a pint to this fabulous band and their first CD!"
5,I've listened to this CD ~20 times in the last four days,"This is how Irish rock/punk music was meant to be made. We just had to wait a while for it to come out. This is the best CD ever. It doesn't even matter what you listen to to enjoy it. I used to be a fluent rap fan until I heard this and now I'm a fluent Amadan fan. This band is seriously good enough to make it to the next Woodstock or something like that. I have burned copy but I like it so much that I'm gonna buy the album. I highly recommend recommending this to other people too. My brothers girlfriend knows one of the members and that's how I found out, so I'm telling you. Buy this. Now. Now. Are you clicking buy...? If yes then gooood, if no, then do it. Seriously. Insanely awsome stout Irish music!!"
4,New Musik's Best?,I my mind it is the best cd from New Music. Maybe becouse it's from an era (-80's) when I got my first real music memories.
5,The Best Recordings Available,"there is none better, and at this price a STEAL. you cannot afford not to get this. I just ordered 5 sets to give away as gifts."
3,One of the Best Albums of 1969,"This is a lame re-issue of the classic Archies' Album, Jingle Jangle. Although this is one of the best albums of 1969, the sound quality isn't any better than typical MP3s. If you're looking for a high quality copy of 'Jingle Jangle, you're best off to find an old album and make a CD yourself. Or contact me - I did just that."
2,COWARD'S THEATRE SONGS,"Sometimes musical artists should NOT attempt cross-over albums. I am a huge fan of Jessye Norman, Leontyne Price and Joan Sutherland, but their ventures into ""popular"" music were, at best, misguided and, at worst, heavy-handed and pretentious. Although Ian Bostridge does not embarrass himself, there is no question that he should stick to more ""serious"" music and leave musical comedy to other singers.The theatre songs of Noel Coward take a very different kind of approach than Bostridge gives them. They need an actor who happens to be singing. Except for a very few of the songs on this CD (written by Coward for operettas instead of musical comedies) Bostridge's approach is absolutely without any character. All of these numbers are impeccably sung by Bostridge, but none of them are ever really acted. Coward's songs MUST be acted whether they were written in a comic or sentimental vein. The result is another misfired cross-over album in what otherwise is a splendid career."
3,Interesting in many ways,"I bought this CD after reading the reviews, asking if it is a wise choice. I love Ian Bostridge art, intelligent artist, great singer; I admire Nol Coward works, intelligent, caustic. But I was not sure of the mix of both.After hearing it, I still have mixed opinions but I like it. Bostridge singing is, as usual, pristine,and his approach (as he pointed out on the album notes) is probably closer to Weill than Coward. Don't know if that is a right choice but it is valid as an artistic proposal.Also, in this kind of albums I always miss the orchestral support. Jeffrey Tate sounds good at the piano, but a little weak given the fact that this is music for the stage.Anyway, the album is good because it is not common to find the work of people like Coward. Also pay attention to Sophie Daneman's interventions, a beautiful voice that deserves more."
1,The sound quality sucks!,Terrible sound quality and non-intuitive controles. Lack of digital radio tuning a HUGE turn-off for radio listeners. Don't buy this piece of junk.
1,"don't buy, junk","To bad I didn't see all these reviews before I bought this unit. Problem is the CD player stopped playing disc in about 6 months. In realty since we didn't use it much, I would say it played 20 CDs before the CD player failed. This is disappointing since I paid close to $180 for this unit. I expected more from SONY. I'm staying away from SONY electronics, whatever they used to do right, they are no longer doing it."
3,Fast delivery. OK product,I purchased the book and received it very quickly. Saying it was in very good condition is slightly over exaggerated. The pages were in pretty good shape but the cover was not. It is a hard back book that is completely faded and scratched up. There was residue from old tape or stickers on the front of the book that makes everything sticky and stick to it. The title and description also says it comes with infotrac. The cardboard insert was in there but it had already been opened and the code had been used Therefore it was not included as it wont work.The book itself contains good information though ad really does help with a Metabolism class. I am able to use this older edition because it contains a lot of the same information
5,One year later - still a favorite,"My mother bought this fire truck and the school bus for my twins second Xmas (they were 14mths). They were the hit of the day and played with almost every day for months. Now that they are 2 they play with their tricycles more, but still love these and pull them out at least once a week. A great deal for so much enjoyment!"
1,Get This Out of My House,"Words can not really express how annoying this toy is. It was a gift for my toddler, who likes it well enough, I guess. Mostly it is just something new and different, but far from spectacular. It also goes against everything we look for in a toy. We will be trying to return it asap.First, this toy is LOUD! Very loud, and the song is an ear-worm that you will find yourself humming. There is a volume control and an off switch, but my son knows where they are and can flip them easily. Next, it is very cheap plastic. I would not expect this toy to hold up to more than a year of moderate play. Finally, other than riding or pushing, there is not a lot of variation of play that can be achieved with this ride on toy. There are many others that are much better."
4,ALWAYS HAPPY WITH FISHER PRICE!,"WE SENT THE FISHER PRICE LITTLE PEOPLE FIRE TRUCK RIDE ON TO OUR GRANDSON FOR HIS FIRST BIRTHDAY. HE LOVED PUSHING IT AROUND FROM THE START. HIS 2 YEAR-OLD BROTHER LIKES RIDING ON IT...AS SOON AS HE SAW THE TRUCK HE RAN TO FIND HIS LITTLE FIRE FIGHTER'S HAT! THIS IS A TOY THE BOYS WILL ENJOY FOR A LONG TIME...THANKS AGAIN FISHER PRICE FROM A HAPPY ""NANNY"""
4,"Great snow pants, but..","My only complaint is that the description on Amazon said that these pants had the cuffs that you can extend as your child grows, but the one's that I received do not. It seems that the color I selected, which was cheaper than other colors, is an older version, that has some different features; while the site mentioned that the silver did not have a pocket, where the other colors did, it said nothing about the cuffs. These cuffs were a major selling point for me and had I known, I would have purchased a different pair that I was also considering."
3,UNanswered Questions answers a few of mine,"It was pretty good. What was there was pretty truthfull, there just wasn't anything really knew for me."
3,Aftermath: Unanswered Questions from 9/11,"First I want to say that the shipping and service was first rate. This movie was OK, but it was not the movie I thought I was ordering. That is no fault of the seller. There is another that is more informative that I still have not located. This one is good as a warm-up to one I saw at a friends home. This movie is thought provoking, but it is a toned down version of the other whose title I am not sure of."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"Just another, yet not so pointed attempt of conspiracy thugs dwelling on ""tweaked"" and downright falsified information. As stated earlier, conspiracies are born every minute.Suggestion...don't let a ridiculous flick like this brainwash you. Do you own homework and come to your own conclusions. I already have and they aren't close to what you'll see in this film. Save your money.Disgusting."
3,the debate,"How can two planes with only jet fuel, no weapons, make three modern, well-constructed skyscrapers collapse in rubble in virtually no time at all, with only fires burning on remote upper floors? Huh? And where is the plane wreckage at the Pentagon? Huh? Watch and wonder with me."
1,A constant vexation unto my spirit,"I liked this phone for the first few months, but the center button gradually stopped working. This is a big problem, since it's needed to use almost all the phone's features. Another frustration is that the battery life is extremely short; I replaced the batteries, but even so the phone has barely enough battery life to ring once. To make a call over five minutes long I have to keep it plugged in, which defeats the purpose of having a mobile phone. The charging stand it came with stopped working, because the contact points don't contact very well. In what may be its final display of wretchedness, the piece covering the camera on the back fell off."
3,Where's Maggie???,Cute book but where is Maggie and Hamiltons name is different in the book. My 5 yr. old seemed to enjoy it anyway.
2,"Great illustration, not so great plot","We loved the pictures in this book! Unfortunately, the plot was lacking. A pig, who is about to eaten by the ferocious beast, manages to divert the beast's intentions by pointing out that he is overweight. The pig proceeds to cook diet foods for the beast. The verse was humorous to adults; my children, however, were not that interested. The ending left much to be desired."
2,Well something had to inspire Splinter Cell...,"The Hunt for Red October was Tom Clancy's first novel and first movie. The games made to be based on it were ported onto three Nintendo systems of the early 90's. Of course you know what three systems were around then but if you were trapped on a deserted island, here they are: Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Nintendo Game Boy. The SNES version was the worst. Like Splinter Cell GBA, you fight in 2-D but instead you drive a submarine. You can use stealth tactics including silent running. The second part to it is after shooting and bombing, you will hit a first person sequence where you must destroy enemy craft. It is very hard without the pricey and useless Super Scope. Just don't buy this game if you know what's good fer ya!"
1,Disappointed,"I could probably give a better rating if I was able to view any of it. As with SG-1 Season 2 box set, none of the episodes will play although all the special features can be viewed with no problem. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,Not what was ordered,"This review is in no way a reflection of the show, which is great. However, the item I recieved was not the one I ordered. The product picture and description indicate it is the whitebox thinset issued in 2006 which was what I wanted. I instead recieved the 1999 large box set. This is one of the unfortunate situations of dealing with Amazon, the prices are great but sometimes the dealers they use misrepresent some of the details of the items they list."
5,StarGate SG-1 Season 3: It's about time.,"I have been waiting for months... And now I get a chance to pre-order this great season. This is where the action gets intense. As you all know; season 2 left off with Hathor about to implant one of the members of SG-1 with a Goa'uld. For those of you just waiting to see the conclusion, you'll find it very action packed with a good story to go with it. As this season progresses, you will see further development on the story of Dr. Jackson and his wife Shaur'e. It will feature much of Daniel Jackson. You will get over 25 hours of media from this boxed set. There are usually 5 episodes per disc and 5 discs. It will also have bonus material: featurettes and episode previews. This, with the first two seasons is in my top pick list. So pick up a copy on Amazon.com and get ready for a great action/sci-fi adventure!"
1,Product not what I ordered,"Not what I ordered. I ordered all 10 seasons of Stargate in the new packaging. 6 arrived correctly, 4 did not and turned up in the old box sets.When you order a set you expect the set to MATCH especially when that is what is indicated when you order them and pay $70 to ship them to New Zealand.Now I have to find somewhere that guarantees what they will look like before I order them. I expected more from Amazon."
5,SG1 is a classic,"My husband and I are long-time fans of the movie Star Gate and the SG1 series. We had been watching the series reruns for months until our local network discontinued it. We were having withdrawal symptoms until we went on line and found that we can purchase all 10 seasons- yea! We read reveiws on the complete collection and found too many negative ratings to go that route, so we've chosen to buy individual seasons, starting with #1, and we're up to season 3 now. So far, we've found that we've missed all but one of the episodes of season 3. It makes us wonder if it's a coincidence that neither of us have seen them or the network chose not to air reruns of this season. Regardless, we're both immensely enjoying this season's episodes, just as much as all the others. The writers for this series had quite the imaginations and threw in so many twists and turns that we're never bored. SG1 rocks!!!"
4,Foreign fan,"So far I've watched disc 1 of season 3, too bad it doesn't include captions at all (not even English!), as some terms are not always understandable just by hearing (Goa'uld language for example). Luckily my TV has CC1 captions that can be enabled. For audio it should have a foreign language track at least (Spanish). Chapters written resumes are shorter than the ones in the series internet site, at least it could have been equivalent."
4,Reliable SF,"The third season of this series maintains its quality. I find a certain reliable workmanship in these episodes. I almost always enjoy the show when I see it, but I am hard-pressed to remember any individual episodes that really hit it out of the ballpark, the way I can with some other series. This may sound like a rather left-handed complement, but I do like the show."
4,Characters You Care About,"This is a full ensemble episode. Every character plays an important part in advancing the story and each develops along the way. The plot development may be linear and prosaic, but it is fun and even tense at times. A very well written episode considering the rigidity of a TV series with a fixed cast. Always been a favorite of mine."
3,one of the best,"this is one of the best tv shows ever; the costumes and stories are great,unfortunately (for me) the dvd doesn't have captions."
4,Stargate SG-1,I love Stargate SG-1 and this Seasoned Box is wonderful to have in my library. I think you would like it too.
4,Synopses a little screwy...,The episodes are excellent; the summaries of the episodes (at least on the Thinpak version) are not. Check them out and you'll see what I mean.
3,Boba Fett? Not exactly...,"A bounty hunter captures our heroes. Nothing new there. The show is clever, though I can't say filled with suspense. Most of the episode is characters interacting with each other and the heroes trying to escape the bounty hunter. This is refreshing in hindsight after years of shoot 'em up episodes in Stargate shows.SPOILER ALERTNote: A character in season 5 of Stargate: Atlantis has the same role as the bounty hunter in this episode: initially hostile, tending to abduct the woman, enslaved to the baddies, and eventually learning to trust the heroes. Worth watching for Stargate fans and sci-fi aficionados."
4,New life for the old bike,"My late-90s Trek 800 sport (3x7 ATB) has been my park and rail trail alt-bike for a long time - I wanted gearing a bit sprightlier than the stock 13-28, but wanted to keep the stock gearing and bulky tires as a fallback. This wheel let me mount up an 11-28 cassette, some trimmer tires, a new chain, and give the old beast has some new snap.Value for money seems quite good, a basic rim on a basic hub, included a skewer.Caveat: it suits my application, which isn't hardcore MTB by any stretch of the imagination, your needs and results may be different.- J"
4,Great watch.,"I like this watch a lot. It is great to put on while playing sports. I bought it to try and keep my nice watch clean for as long as possible. Now I have a cheap, rugged alternative. My only problem has been trying to remember how to use the 300 functions that this watch has. Not a big deal I'll pick them up little by little."
3,"Not for outdoor use, not temps over 90F and not for very slow flow","We bought a digital flow meter to measure a slow but steady flow. The meter will measure it, but if the flow is very low, I'm not sure how accurate it is. We measured over 3 weeks time and each week we got a different number. (50% off between the high and low reading for each week.) Also for temps over 90F, the display goes blank. It did this every week. I do not know if the meter did not record during those times and that might explain the differences in flow, but regardless, not rated for outdoor use and not rated for use over 90F. And not sure how accurate it is on low flow situations. It does seem like a well constructed unit and for indoor use under 90F it might be fine."
3,not so good,"I received this book as a gift. While I agree the recipes are great, the time that the majority of them require is just not available to those of us who are busying working a 50 hr week and chasing kids. However, if you've got the time this may be the best one for you."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered using ISBN number as given by my university. What I received was not the same ISBN. It was the same title of the book, just the incorrect revision. I am doing an accelerated course, so the seller's offer of just return it for a full refund was not very helpful to me. I don't know if the problem was with the seller or Amazon. I am quite dissapointed that I got the wrong book. There are discrepancies."
3,Something Everyone Should Have,"I was planing on cleping this. I enjoyed the content so much, that I got a book cover for it."
3,it's required for class,"It's a decent textbook. I disagree with the authors opinions on what is and is not art and the chapter on architecture is somewhat confusing, but it is required for class. Not bad."
3,Very Dry- But informative.,"This book probably did what it was supposed to do. To bad I was not interested. I love the study of humanities, but not in a book. Everything is subject to ones views. And this book does give you information but lacks a certain depth. The pics aren't great either. Pick it up if you have to but beware."
2,Needed the book for school,"I purchased this book to save some money. I needed the newer edition, but after reading that is book was exactly the same work for work I decieded to purchase this edition. To start with it is not exactly the same; there are some really big differences. The other problem I had was the condition this book came in. In the description there was nothing that said pages 1-6 were disconnected from the binding. I might have bought this book anyway, the honestly would have been nice."
2,"not bad, try lsitening to 'gladiator' soundtrack - last song","i found the sing 'tempest' a bit depressing. 'sacrifice was better, it reminds me of the ong 'now we are free' at the end of the movie 'the gladiator'. but 'now' is much better then either."
4,The music sets the tone,"This film kept me...literally...on the edge of my seat throughout its run time, and after listening to the soundtrack, I know this music was a huge part of that tension. It perfectly fits the ominous air about the storyline. I've had nothing else on my CD player since I bought this, 3 days ago."
4,It's a different sound,"If you like Dead Can Dance, you'll like the dark sound of this cd. Haunting!For those who get inspired by the unusual"
4,Dumbfounded,An excellent movie with an awesome score is always a bonus. This films score is not only beautiful but well defined. Lisa Gerrad lends her vocals and skill to make this a unique musical experience. The lead track Tempest has no lyrics but its tone and driving drums and throbbing bass tell a tale of urban bliss turned into a paranoia and surrealistic hell. The rest of the tracks all supplement this theme the only dissapointment was the Massive Attack song which was good but personally its not to my taste.
5,The Insider,"If you do not have Lisa Gerrard & Peter Bourke's Duality, this is a wonderful CD. The unfortunate note here is that The Insider CD has several selections from Duality but nowhere is this stated in the reviews I read or on the CD itself. I'm not good at remembering the names of individual selections on my CD's, or I might have caught it. Since I have opened the CD in order to hear it, I now own it."
2,We have owned this for several months,"Most important of all is that our cats use it. It doesn't tip over. However don't touch the rope, I got a piece in my finger. After owning it for several months, we are not please with the carpeting where the cats scratch it. It has been shredded to nylon like strings that we have to cut off. We have since bought a different scratching post. The new one is all sisal no carpeting."
2,VERY POORLY CRAFTED,Received the product and noticed right out of the box that the carpet in the center of the post was kind of loose.Within 10 days my 2 cats had the carpet hanging off and the rope loose all around it. My husband put a bunch of staples in it with an air gun and it seems to be holding up. A consumer shouldn't have to fix a product purchased so soon after receiving it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the nice height and weight of it.I definately would not recommend this to anyone.
4,"A bit pricey, but a decent product","I bought this for my two cats to stretch out, even though it was a lot more than I wanted to spend on a cat scratcher. I looked for something similar but cheaper, but couldn't find one. It probably only cost a few dollars in materials; there's not much to it. I have 2 large males, and the standard 16"" scrachers didn't work very well anymore, especially for them to stretch their backs. This one is over 3 feet tall and is very sturdy so it won't tip over. The only thing I don't like about it is that it has a chemical smell that I can't get rid of, even though I've sprayed catnip spray all over it. My cats don't seem to mind though."
1,Homemade better,"I made a scratching post for our cat from a lawn timber & a piece of plywood. She loved it! Used it frequently. Then we went on a vacation and for the first time, took our cat. I took the post along so she would have something familiar while we were gone. Well I forgot to bring it back - duh. So I bought this rope scratching post for home. The cat will use it some times, but not nearly as often as the one I made! I thought cats were supposed to love this sisal rope, mine does not. And at $50 It is way overpriced. If you are handy, make one from a lawn timber! Oh yeah, get the kind NOT treated with chemicals to kill bugs & stuff."
3,a little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed at how dated this video is. Of course the history of the country doesn't change but the production of the video is at least 10 years old ... and shows it. I wanted to give my Chinese students a look at what Australia is like (my home) and I am too embarrassed to show it to them. It misses out a lot of Australia that I think is the core of Australia. For example, the rugged farming and country towns that each have their own character. Instead the video focuses on the cities and some of the history of Australia. The wildlife, the Great Barrier Reef and the beach life were also poorly represented. Very disappointing...!"
4,DVD-Australia/New Zealand,"Very informative, giving a sense of how large this area is, and what special sites to try to take in while touring some of the major cities."
2,Not much new here...,"I read the first review and thought ""whoopee""- I found it!. I was wrong.If you haven't yet figured out to:1) pay off your house2) save more3)spend less4)work longer if necessary and5) don't buy a NEW car, but a used onethen this is for you.Otherwise I did not find anything I hadn't already seen elsewhere (mostly on the websites for AARP, Social Security, and CalPERS) or figured out on my own."
1,Don't bother,I will keep this review short. The product DOES NOT work. Period. I have been using the product morning and evening since the begining of February and have not seen a single change. I just bought some Olay eye cream a week ago and can already see an improvement.
