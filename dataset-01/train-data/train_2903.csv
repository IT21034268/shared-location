3,Good / not so good product,"The Trudeau Nonstick egg poacher is a nice product for its ease of use. However, it is not a notstick product. The first time I used it I did not think it was necessary to use any spray of butter and the eggs stuck to the poacher very badly. The second time I used it I sprayed two of the sections and put butter in the other two as a test to see which product worked best. The eggs in the sprayed sections came out of the poacher easier but portions of the eggs still stuck to all sections, spray or butter. I believe the directions could be clearer in how to prevent the eggs from sticking in this ""Nonstick"" product."
3,small Christmas card display,"Perfect display for your Christmas cards if you prefer to have them on your desk, table or on a kitchen shelf. We did combine it with a bigger one for the floor. But you don't have too."
3,Too condensed,It is a substantial piece of hardware. I only wish that the branches were a little more far flung or spread out as I use it to display greeting cards for sale and the areas between the branches force all the cards together like a heavy snow on a tree with many long branches. I will keep the device but will be looking for something else a little more akin to my needs and wants.
5,Beautiful and serious study of Aristotle's syllogistic,"In addition to Mr. Ole Anders' review, I would add that Lukasiewicz can also be credited with the invention of three-valued logic, and for being one of the first researchers on the principle of contradiction, also treated in this book. Concerning the book itself, it presents a nice and very readable exposition of Aristotle's work on logic. It can even be considered as a completion of the Organon, with a very sharp critical aparatus. Lukasiewicz worked all his life on Aristotle's syllogistic and this book, whose second edition was published shortly after his death, can be considered as a summary of his long time thinkings about that. Even if Lukasiewicz did not publish anything else, he would enter history because of this book. A note about editions: the second edition has enlarged the first with the addition of three chapters on the modal logic of Aristotle, so it differs deeply from the first."
3,Mascagni: Cavalleria Rusticana,"Our public radio stations ceased airing classical music last year. I can't afford the new radios, and the subscriptions to the pay stations. I've slowly been adding some of my favs to play in my DVD in the car. I find that most used products work just fine."
4,Very good - but not the best,"Many swear by this Levine recording with Scotto and Domingo; it is very dramatic and beautifully played, but, despite her histrionic abilities, Scotto's raw top bothers me, Pablo Elvira's Alfio is ordinary and even a little under-powered, and Levine does not bestow upon this music the last ounce of flexibility and affection it ultimately requires - thus the Intermezzo does not ""swoon"" as it should. I listened carefully and admired much that I heard but Domingo does not provide the brute, animal passion of Del Monaco in the 1961 Serafin recording with Simionato and Cornell MacNeill (see my review) or the plangent incisiveness of Bjorling in the intermittently available 1957 version conducted by Erede with the dream team of Tebaldi, Bjorling and Bastianini, all in top form. This is undoubtedly very fine but, as we know, the best is the enemy of the good and you get a more authentic, better sung and more idiomatically played ""Cav"" if you go with the older recordings."
4,A nice book... but there are better ND books,"I bought this book expecting more, but I am a bit disappointed. It does a good job of individual player bios, but if you want a more comprehensive encyclopedia, pick up the Notre Dame media guide published by the university. That book has over 480 pages all on ND history and has all time records."
2,From J. Kaye's Book Blog,"I couldn't get into the characters of this story. I didn't like Meg. And well, it's hard to get into the story after finding that out. Clint was fine, better than fine, in fact. But that Meg...On the first page, when it refers to Meg watching Captain Kangaroo at a tender age, I wondered how old she was? Also, the story itself was a bit lame. The characters were very well developed and the ending was as good as it was going to get considering my feelings about Meg.Another thing, and maybe the second most important is after reading the word ""yummy"", it all went downhill for me. This word has been popping up everywhere. It's gotten to the point, if I read the word ""yummy"" again I'm going to have to go back to watching television. To be fair though, this book was written a few years back. Still, that word - ugh!"
2,Its not that great :[,"The Medela company its not bad, but they did fail to provide a manual breast pump.1. It leaks a lot of my precious milk.2. It doesn't pump all of your milk.3. It hurts your nipple after continuous uses.The only good thing I can say about it is that is portable."
1,Save your money for a better pump,"I bought this pump because I was planning on exclusively breastfeeding and thinking I wouldnt need an electric pump since I would only be doing the occasional pumping. Well there is a reason the product comes with a 30 day warranty... because on the 31st day it isnt going to work anymore. At first it worked amazing, but after using it only a handful of times, it started to lose suction. I tried contacting Medela about it but they sent me an email reminding me of the 30 day warranty. So I finally caved and bought an electric pump... a Lansinoh."
5,The best price and pump..don't waste your money on expensive pumps!,"I was 5 weeks early so I didn't have a pump yet so I rented the electric commercial one from the hospital which was $50 a month and a couple weeks after I bought this manual pump which was 10 times better.Easier to pump, softer, less hassle...Didn't have to get up plug it in every time...and the plastic tubes on the electric ones were annoying especially when you had to clean them. Plus, this is better for bringing to work, etc. Don't waste your money spending $50, $100, or even $200 on a pump...that's ridiculous.I read all the reviews on pumps and I agree with this pump getting 5 stars all the way."
1,Lost suction after a few uses,"After one month of occasional use Medela manual pump started loosing air which resulted in a poor suction. I can hear the air hissing, probably there is a tear in a valve. Also, the tube is not transparent so you can't see the milk coming out of the breast. In my other, Avent pump I can see the flow. I switched to Medela because it had a bigger bottle attached. But now I have to go back to Avent since this one is no use. I thought Medela made quality pumps. Very dissapointed."
2,not as good as the Avent breast pump,"I have been using the Avent breast pump, but lately the little `star' part is beginning to `pop' and I needed a new pump. Have read very good reviews comparing the Medela Harmony Manual to the Avent pump, so I gave it a try.The suction of Medela is not strong enough. It takes ages to pump, and just doesn't pump enough! My baby takes 3 oz and I only managed to pump 2 oz! And after pumping only 2 oz, and extremely frustrated, I used the Avent pump immediately after, and managed to express another 1 oz more!There are fewer parts to clean with the Medela pump but it's more difficult to clean, like the tiny hole where the milk flow through cannot be cleaned by any brushes.I am going to get another Avent breast pump right now."
1,It stopped working after a month or two,It worked GREAT at first and I really loved it but after a month or two it just stopped working. I became extremly frustrated with it and even thought that maybe I wasn't producing milk properly even though my baby seemed to be putting on weight just fine. I went and bought a new pump and I was able to pump 6 oz. So it must have been the pump.
1,Medella does not care about their customers,"I bought a Medella hand pump for convenience so I wouldn't have to constantly use my electric pump. On the handle of the hand pump there is a tiny O ring that is barely brought up in the instructions. This O ring easily pops off while washing and disappears as it is about a 1/4"" in diameter. When the O ring is gone the hand pump is useless. Both of my O rings have managed to disappear and to replace this virtually cost-free item you have to buy the entire handpiece again for 20$. I called the company and even after spending thousands of dollars on medella pumps and pumping equipment they refused to send me a replacement O ring...I will never buy another medella product. It seems that they want you to lose this tiny item so that you have to continually spend more money on their products."
2,Not the BEST choice,"This pump works~ but you have to work very hard at it. Every new mom deserves a healthy, happy beginning. If you are going to invest any amount of money, I highly recommend purchasing an electric one or renting from a hospital or lactation center. You will save yourself a lot of time and frustration. Your energy belongs elsewhere, not here!"
5,Great for occasional pumping,"I wasn't sure how much I'd be pumping before I had my daughter, but I wanted to have something on-hand in case of engorgement, etc. When it turned out I had to pump almost full-time for a few months, I did head out and get the electric Pump in Style, but this served me until then. It takes longer than an electric pump and it will really do your hand in if you're using it often, but it's also much more portable than an electric pump. When I no longer needed to pump as frequently, I used this one when traveling."
2,Broke very early on!,"I loved this pump and used it occasionally (a couple times a week. I have only been using it for a couple months now (total of maybe 15 times at the most), and it stopped working! No more suction! I have tried troubleshooting and all that and nothing. Plus. the company only offers a 30 day warranty, so I don't expect them to help. I'm still going to try, though!"
3,PersonalFit vs. SoftFit breastshield,"Medela Harmony #67186, includes PersonalFit breastshield, instead of the Amazon.com described and explicitely expected SoftFit breastshield....Question now is: where do we get a SoftFit breastshield..."
5,Great!,"Great product, does the job very well. I was worried about had getting tired while pumping but it is not as hard. Super light and great to throw into the purse with you if you are away from the little one for a few feedings.Fast shipping."
5,Very happy,"When I got the Harmony pump, I wasn't ready to put out $300 for an electric pump. I wasn't sure what I would prefer, and at the time I was working on supply rather than building a stash. So the first time I used it, I recall getting several ounces in just a few minutes, much more than I expected. (I should note I was dealing with oversupply, and got way more than most nursing moms should expect) I love that this has total 5 parts to clean, including the shield and bottle. It's quick and easy to put together, handy when I need a quick pump overnight when I'm engorged from a long sleep. Over the past few months my supply has regulated and I get much less milk in the same amount of time, but I still am happy with my purchase in the beginning."
3,Kept losing suction,"I actually bought this after using the medela electric pump for a few months as I wanted something easily portable.This pump is easy to assemble and use. However, the problem I faced was that I couldn't get a good seal between my breast and the cup. Milk would somehow seep in and I would have to stop, clean off the milk, wait for the cup to dry then pump again. This was quite troublesome when I'm pressed for time (eg. pumping between surgeries).I felt that I could have pumped more milk if there was better suction and if there was less stress with using the product.In the pump room at my work place, there were many mothers who raved about their philips Avent manual breast pump. That's why I'm now looking to purchase that for my second child."
3,Average,"I got this pump free from the hospital. It was working fine for 2 weeks. However, it started losing it's suction power, the rubber, I think, needs to be replaced."
4,Very godo but don't last much,Very good product for occasional usage. For my wife lasted only 3 weeks with everyday 3-4 times a day pump. If you need to pump everyday Medela Eletric adv pump is the way to go.
3,Disappointed at the product,It worked well while it worked but it broke within about 2 months. There seems to be some leakage in the pump. Disappointed.
3,Hard to dry completely - mould set in,"My wife purchased and used this pump for our second baby. It did the job wonderfully, but we found it difficult to clean, while ensuring that it could dry properly. We thought we did the job thoroughly when it was packed away. Our 3rd baby arrived 3 days ago, and we brought out the pump...no good. Mould was all through an area that is practically impossible to clean. So, we need to buy a new one.Regardless, Canada gets hosed on this item. It is not sold on Amazon in Canada, but the identical item at Babies R Us here is $64.99, plus our 15% tax.AND, there is only a 90 day warranty / part replacement plan.Excellent product, poor pricing and warranty, at least in Canada."
5,I was skeptical but it's wonderful!,Having used a few other hand pumps in the past I was really skeptical about trying another. If it hadn't been for the positive reviews I wouldn't have tried.This pump is PERFECT for my needs. I only need a bottle here and there when I go out or to mix with baby cereal. I think it's fast and well worth the price. Don't waste your money with other brands. This is a keeper!
2,Only good if you havent tried anything else,"I bought it. I used it for several times but i didnt like it.the edge of shield is firm. it doesnt fit the breast. and milk leaks out, so you have to hold it with hand with a tissue. after a month shield began to loose its shape.then it sucks really hard. my poor nipples were purple even after few minutes of pumping.Then i bought electrical one. MiPump by First years. It costs twice the price of this pump, but it sucks really gentle but strong enough (you can adjust the strength of pumping) with a sort of vibration. and it feels about the same way as a baby sucking. it is electrical and works both from batteries and electricity. and pumps 2 breasts at one time.shields are very soft. and i just enjoy pumping now.Medela is a cool brand, i liked the cream for nipples by Medela and some other products but i am ready to throw this pump away in a dumpster."
1,Utterly Disappointed,"What a complete waste of money. Why can't I give ZERO stars? I was so disappointed with the performance of this pump, that I cried. The suction is so weak that even after 15 minutes (yes, FIFTEEN MINUTES) of pumping, it fails to stimulate a letdown. I've given this pump plenty of chances/tries (a whole MONTH'S worth of tries!!) with absolutely NO improvement. Are you fricking kidding me, Medela? IMPROVE YOUR MANUAL PUMP! Don't waste your money on this POS. Buy an AVENT ISIS if you must go manual."
1,doesn't work if you are used to an electric,"I bought this thinking it would be easier to use at work than my electric. I am a waitress and thought I could use it in the bathroom (no outlets). I'd been using the electric at home every morning to build a stockpile of milk in the fridge. This manual pump would not work for me, or maybe it would have if I had kept at it, but it took way too long for me. I guess this is because I'm used to the electric. The manual sits in a drawer in my house, and the electric comes with me to work..."
1,fell apart,this pump is very flimsy. i managed to get only 1-2 good pumping sessions out of it before it broke.
5,Better then an electric pump,I bought the hand pump so I could pump while I was out for the day or in the car. This was after I spent $300 on the electric pump. This one works so much better and I can pump faster then my other one. Everyone told me not to buy it because my hand would get tired of pumping but I get better results. I wish I saved my money and just bought this one.
1,Save Your $$$,"Just hand express your milk. I had mastitis during first month - this pump did nothing. The only way to get milk out was by hand. Now my girl 6 months and i tried to use this pump again - few drops of milk and lots of pain. Then i try hand expressing - works great.Don't be scared to hand express milk - its easy, free and just perfect for occasional use."
2,Not durable parts - air leaks,"I used this manual pump for three weeks, air start to leak between the suction cup and the main body. I don't recommand this."
3,Okay for occasional use but that's it,"I bought the Harmony because I wanted to leave my Pump in Style at work on the weekends and to use for traveling. So far it's been disappointing. It could just be me, but it takes a long time for my milk to let down. My hand is tired well before I'm even close to being done on one side. The top part often comes off while I'm using it so I have to stop and put it back together. Based on my experience with this pump, I would not recommend it for more than occassional use. I don't think it works as a replacement for an electric pump so I will continue to lug the Pump in Style around. I'll use this one just for relieving nighttime engorgement and that's probably it."
2,Breaks Quickly,"At first it was a really great product. Then I had to start replacing pieces frequently, and having to break-down the whole thing every few days to wash it was irritating. If I left anything together mold appeared. Eventually after only a few months I could no longer get any suction no matter which piece I adjusted or replaced."
2,Hole in the handle after couple of months usage,"I have used this pump for 2 months and one day, i have noticed that it was not working and i checked each part. Finally, i have noticed a hole inside of the handle. I would say bad quality product."
2,Needs better instructions or examples,"Symphony is better. I needed a manual pump in case I needed it due to power failure or short trips that don't have electricity. I tested it upon receipt and it's difficult to determine how to manually pump. How fast and how hard and how many pumps per minute, etc. After trial and error I ended up hurting myself and took two days to feel better. Now I'm afraid to use it when I really need it."
5,Perfect for travel,"I use a double electric everyday at work, but for weekend trips it is nice to have something smaller to travel with. The suction is far better than I expected, and actual pumping time is very close to my electric. You actually have to be carefull becuase you can generate much more suction than is comfortable. The hand grip is comfortable to hold. Overall great product."
3,Great While it Lasted,"The lactation specialist at my hospital was really endorsing this pump. And though some people think electric pumps should be used by working moms I wanted a small and quiet hand pump to express milk at work. This pump worked wonderfully for about 3 months. Then it suddonly lost suction. I think it must have developed an air leak, but I couldn't locate the problem. I had to rush out to the store that evening to buy a new pump, and I decided against the Medela brand. Also, my daughter refused to take the weird-shaped nipples, and I ended up using a different brand nipple that fit these bottles. On the upside, this pump is very easy to take apart, clean, and put back together."
4,great pump,"I'm very happy with this pump.I take it to work and it's very light and very easy to handle, and most importantly I manage to pump a decent amount.the only thing I would have liked is if it came with a case, preferably an isolated one, so I wouldn't have to buy one separately."
4,Manual Pump,"This is the best manual pump i've used. Needed it for an all day amusement park w/o the baby.it was great, small and easy to use :)"
5,Comfortable to use,"I use an electric pump when I am at home, but am a wedding planner and am often on the go. I needed something small that I could bring with me to weddings, slip out of sight, pump, and get right back into the swing of things. This pump has been perfect for the job! The cup is so much more comfortable than the ones that come with my electric pump because it is flexible. I had heard so much about manual pumps taking forever, but this is just as quick as my electric one!"
1,Madela Manual Breast Pump,We purchased Madela Pump with great expectations but within 15 days its suction got weak.We bought manual pump to use it occasionaly. After using it few times only its suction pump performence got impacted which was not really expected with brand like Madela.I am not sure if I can return/replace this product now.Please advice me if I can still return this pump.
1,"Leaks, poor suction",I purchased this pump for occasional use during travel. It worked great the first 2-3 times but quickly lost suction. I took the pieces apart and made sure all of the connections were secure but still had poor suction and kept leaking from the bottom of the breast shield. This is really disappointing. This manual pump is quite inferior to my pump in style.
2,Only useful for small amounts of milk needed.,"I bought this item in case I needed to pump for emergencies while traveling. However, upon testing it out, it took me almost 1/2hour to pump barely 1oz. Both my hands got tired. If you need to pump just a little milk, its ok, but not for a full feeding unless you want to sit for hours to do so."
2,Worked well until it broke!,"I (Timothy's wife) used this pump for occasional relief of engorgement, but it fell apart after only a few uses. The part that connects the handle to the pump snapped, making it unusable. Definitely a disappointment, since I was gentle with it, used it properly, and it fell apart during a routine assembly after washing. I would like another like this, but can't bring myself to buy a second like this to replace one that should not have broken after only a couple of uses."
5,"So convenient, light, and EASY!","Let's face it, breastfeeding is challenging and pumping on the go or at work is even MORE challenging. I bought this manual pump because I was so tired of carrying around my Avent double electric. I LOVE this pump! It's quiet and easy and doesn't tire your hand or arm out. Seriously, buy it. It's amazing and has made my life a heck of a lot easier!"
2,Not the best,I used this pump with my son who was breast feed for 7 months. It does not hold suction very well and when it did I found it ok strong. I got tears along my nipple that I didn't even get from my baby latching on. I took it on some over night trips when I didn't have my baby and it did not re-leave me at all I would pump 8 oz and still be in pain in certain spots.
5,Excellent!,"I bought this for my wife when our baby was born. She used sporadically for 1 month and then on a daily basis for 2 months 3 times a day because she had to get back to work and had to leave the breastmilk for the baby.Excellent product, no failures. Very fast pumping, no troubles. Easy cleaning. The only thing you have to keep in mind is to have the pump completely assembled or it is too unstable (when using non Medela bottles) and most of the times it will fall on the table (or the floor if not so lucky) when empty.Had to replace the membrane twice as the little tab that holds it place tore a little."
4,Easy to use,"This pump is a great manual pump. It is easy to clean and use. I love how the handle swivels so that you can use it at any angle. Great when you are pumping and feeding at the same time.This is great to use to make occasional bottles or to relieve engorgement. I plan on buying an electric one to make more bottles, but will continue to use this one (especially outside the house)."
1,Look for something else,I bought this breast pump just to help me while I am at home so that I can bottle feed the baby at night and give myself a break every once in a while. The first time I used it; it seemed okay and I was able to get a little milk but there was not much suction. I have only been able to get results when using it once. I have tried to use it many times since then and there is not really any suction and certainly not enough milk to save as it takes forever to get a few drops. I do not recommend this product even for stay at home moms.
1,PoS,This pump was used at maximum 20 times and it is already broken. Not the quality I expected from Medela.
1,wasted money,"This pump broke the second time I used it. Don't waste $ purchasing this....you'll be better off putting the cash towards an electric pump, which is what I did & am pleased with that decision. I am in the process now of contacting Medela and getting a refund."
2,took me foerver to get 2 oz.!,"With my first child i got a medela hand pump from hospital it was a older one 7 years ago with the long handle..this workked great..pumped the bottles with no problem ..my hand did get tired but it worked..this pump was givin to me by the hospital as well ....however only ever pumps 2 0z. at a time for me ..and it seems im pumping for 20-30 mins! and i know my daughter feeds fast and milk sprays out so its not me..ive even tryed feeding her after pumping the 1oz or 2..and she still gets alot out.. also.. if you pump fast with it the handle can come loose and get moved off socket and then theres air,,i like the fact it came with soft sheild but i dont think it sucks as well as the last pumps hard one i had..im just going to buy a electric i guess..looks nice and it is easyer then some hand pumps but easy isnt always better far and pumps go i guess.."
1,Do not buy!,"I wanted a hand held pump to use while exclusively BF my daughter. I am with her most of the time, so I only need to pump every once in a while. I was going to buy a Lansinoh but instead I bought this spite the negative rumors that I had heard about it. I used this pump 3 times over a 5 month period, and today was the 6th. When I began pumping, I noticed that it was pumping a little funny. It was only putting small drops into the bottle when it should have been more of a small flow. I looked at the pump after noticing what was actually in the bottle and when I turned it over, about 2 oz of breastmilk poured out on my lap. I checked to see if all of the parts were on right and they are. the bottle was also on all the way. Now, my baby is 2 oz short of her lunch, and I am [...] short on money and a breast pump. I should have just bought the Lansinoh."
3,ok product,doesn't pump out as much as i had expected...used once and then gave it away...too much work cleaning it...
4,Very good product.,I used it through out my nursing period for my second child. The best part is I dont have to depend on battery or electricity while using this and also the sound it makes is much lower than the battery operated one or the electric one.I loved it. Only that I needed to replace it atleast 3times and the cost was a killer.
5,Worth the money,"There are some things in life that will serve you just as well whether it's a high-end or more economical version. Breast pumps are not one of those things. I bought this system after I'd already been using a rental pump for several months, and kicked myself that I didn't do it sooner. Medela literally thought of everything, and it worked really well at home, at work, and in the car. If you're serious about nursing, it's worth every penny to do it ""in style""."
1,conked out after 2 wks,"It worked fine the first two weeks of use. I liked it because there are few parts to clean and it was so easy to use and carry around.The problem is that suddenly, i noticed that suddenly the suction was gone and i was producing half the milk that i normally produced for the same amount of time. The worst part of it was that my breasts got engorged, i developed fever and chills.I have since bought an Avent manual pump and i am so much more happy with the choice"
3,Time Consuming,"I got this pump for free from my local WIC office, I thought what the heck I will use it for a while and see what I think before I buy a electric pump. I am a stay at home mom and only pump once a day when my daughter is down for the night (she sleeps about 10hrs straight)....the pump works but I can tell just from feeling my breast that there is more in there that the pump is not able to get out. It also takes quite a bit of time and I am constanly having to let the suction off and reposition to keep the flow of milk going. I would recommend this pump if you are only pumping once or twice a week, anymore than that and it seems that you are spending all your free time with it. I am looking for a electric pump now to hopefully cut down on the pumping time....and give my hand a much needed break."
4,Great pump,"This is a good pump, I had to buy a second because the 1st one didnt really come aprat very well and got mold on it but the 2nd one comes apart more easily and is easy to clean, great for pumping after your baby has slept thru the night!"
5,BEST PUMP,I BREAST FEAD MY FIRST SON FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND PUMPED AS WELL. I THINK THAT THE REASON SOME WOMEN DON'T LIKE MANUAL PUMPS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT USING THEM PROPERLY AND THE SAME GOES FOR BREASTFEEDING. IT TAKES A GOOD 8 WEEKS TO REALLY GET GOING WITH BREASTFEEDING AND SOME DON'T KNOW THAT. I PUMPED JUST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE AND AS FAST AS AN ELECTRIC WITH THE FREE MEDELA I WAS GIVEN AT THE HOSPITAL. I DID USE A MACHINE WHICH I RENTED FOR A FEW WEEKS BUT I WENT BACK TO THIS. IT IS GREAT AND I LOVED IT.
1,Very Little Suction,I bought this pump to use at work after my maternity leave. I haven't been back to work as yet and have used the pump about 15 times in 12 weeks and the suction is gone. I pumped for about 1/2 hour on one breast that I hadn't fed my baby from and only got an ounce.
1,not impressed at all with the pump,"I bought the pump because I had read the reviews on this product and got the impression that it was one of the best manual pumps. That might be true, but my experience was dissapointing. The pump did not suction hard enough to produce milk. I tried several times through out the day and the pump did not suction out enough milk. Needless to say the pump is sitting in the closet."
1,NOT BPA-free! And lost suction.,"This pump is NOT BPA-free. Note the fine print: only ""parts that come into contact with breastmilk"" are BPA-free, which means the handle, the part YOU touch the most, has BPA, as I discovered from the little #7 plastic sign on the back.This brings me to another point: I only uncovered the #7 sign when I was poking around wondering why my pump had lost suction after only a few months of occasional use (several other reviews here noted the same thing). I found a little tear in the clear plastic underside of the handle. Very disappointed in the quality."
3,rent from the hospital first,"this is like the one the hospital gave me. i wish i had started out by renting the hospital grade pump. that way it is less time consuming, you empty your breast completely and pain free."
1,Broke in three uses. Manual pumping is a waste of time.,I bought this breastpump for my first baby and it broke after I had used it three times. This pump is tricky to assemble.I called the 1-800 number and they would not believe that it broke they just kept telling me I had put it together wrong. I am not an imbecile I know the difference between broken and not put together. It had come unglued. Anyway I bought it before my son was born and so my 30 day money back guarantee was over.Trying to manual pump is nuts your hand gets tired fast and the milk comes out slowly. It was faster for me to hand express. I bought an electric pump to replace it.
2,Bad suction but maybe....,I had a really hard time with this pump I really hurt I am verry large and maybe that is why I have heard that you can buy a bigger cup but I already bought the advent pump. Actually I have the similar problems with it.
3,See the image for contents. Do not trust the features they mentioned.,"I ordered this product assuming I will get all the components that are mentioned in the FEATURES on Amazon product page. But I got only those that are in the picture. I did not get adopter, battery pack...etc. Also shipping weight says 8.82 pounds but the package that I received is hardly 2 pounds.But the product is good."
4,best manual,"I tried 2 electric pumps and 3 other manual pumps before I received this one from WIC. It is by far the best for me. I didn't like the electric because they either didn't have enough suction or too much. The other manuals were painful or too hard to control the amount of suction - one of them had a dial on it that didn't work, don't remember which one. Anyway, the shield on this one is comfortable, even with large breasts. The let down system works well. The only problem I have had is producing more than the 5oz. bottle holds - tried using a larger bottle and it didn't seem to suction correctly. I have gone through several of the little white membrane cover things, but they're cheap and you have to expect to replace something as you continually use it. I pump everyday - after feedings and occasionally to replace a feeding."
3,Cheap pump,"I got this pump as a gift at my baby shower. At first I was really happy with it. It was easy to clean, easy to use, some no name storage bottles I bought at BRU fit it without a problem and I could produce milk really fast with it. Then after about the tenth use of it the suction started to fail. I took the whole thing apart, replaced some little parts and still there was no improvement. So I would only recommend this pump for moms that only want something to use on the rare occasion that they will be away from their babies when it's feeding time and they don't want to risk their supply diminishing. If you need to pump more than that I suggest looking into a different pump."
2,We don't really use this at all,"It seems well made, but the pumping with it is very slow. Now maybe that's to be expected with a hand pump, but if you're going to e doing any amount of pumping either prepare for repetitive stress injury or get an electric. The freestyle is great."
2,Worked once,I bought this from Toys R us while on vacation because the Nuk I bought is a piece of junk. Well this isn't really much better. It loses suction very easily and is a pain the butt to get even the 4oz I need for a full feeding.
5,Perfect manual breast pump,Was so glad that I didnt need to spend a ton of $$$$ for an electric breast pump. This manual one did the trick and I had no complaints whatsoever. It's compact and very easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product to other moms out there on a budget.
3,"If you pump more than 2-3x per week, get the Swing!","This is great for travelling or very occasional pumping, but I figured it would be plenty for my one bottle a day. No way, upgrade to the Swing electric, it'll be SO worth it!"
2,Good while it lasted...,"Used this pump for about a month and it lost suction. I also own an electronic pump for work, so this was just used a few times when I was too engorged and baby was too full to feed. It worked pretty well while it lasted. It pumped fast and it was easy to use. I really wish it had lasted longer. After about a month of use, it began to lose it's suction. Every time I press the handle to pump, I would hear air passing through it when it is supposed to create suction. I can't figure out what's wrong with it. All I know is that my milk supply has suffered and I haven't been able to build it back up. I have another manual pump that broke within two months of use as well, so maybe manual pumps just don't work for me."
5,Essential for Research,"I do research in machining at the University of New Hampshire. This book is the essential resource that all of my graduate students refer to on a regular basis. I recommend it for anyone doing research in the machining field. I would also recommend Tlusty's book, ""Manufacturing Processes and Equipment"" as a second essential resource."
4,Electronic at its best,"If you've heard The Azoic's previous albums, this one may come as a partial surprise. They have moved from a slower, darker sound to a more dance floor-oriented sound - and it's a complete success in my opinion. Some tracks are truly outstanding, such as Progression and Redemption. A great value."
2,Surf Film Review honest,"If you like movies like the JOB, Bruce Movie, Modern Collective, Trilogy, High5, Intersection etc. , I don't recomend this movie. I was expecting more after a local surf shop owner gave it the thumbs up. The surfing is very fair/poor and the waves in general were just ok. I understand big budgets produce high quality wave shoots, like JOB, but this is just not impressive. I have surfed over 30 years and seen every video part so I am not trying to be a jerk. Just honest review."
5,makes me wanna sow my wild oats!,"garage? yes, although at the time I don't think anyone in the band had a garage. beat music? also yes. amazing record by a legendary band that ALWAYS had me dancing. and I don't dance, so that's saying sumthin."
5,Book Review,I found this a fascinating look at presidential power and gave me further insights into Nixon and the power structure that existed around him. I remember the days of Watergate but this gave me new insights and background information about what actually went on. It's truly a slice of living history. Also the similarities between Vietnam and Iraq are almost frightening...perhaps some of those in command should read this too.
3,Detailed Description of Oval Office Life,"The author provides a detailed description of what was going on between Nixon and his staff during his presidency, courtesy of official documents and personal diaries. Unfortunately, the writing was dry and the author did not include much about Richard Nixon's wife and daughters to show the human side of Nixon. Julie Nixon Eisenhower receives the most print space. Her mother and sister, almost nothing."
2,Very Bland,This is a very flat recitation of anecdotes of the Nixon presidency. In the first few pages we are reminded that Nixon was a brooding loner. The rest of the book provides supporting material.
5,BEST SINGLE VOLUME ON THE BONAPARTES,"The complexity of Napolean's family life, with numerous brothers, sisters, wives, children,in laws---and his ever present mother---makes one wonder how he ecer had time to fight and to win battles. Well written and all shockingly real."
5,Great songs for mis hijos,This is a beautiful way for us as Hispanic parents share and celebrate our vibrant Spanish language with our children.Esta es una muy bonita manera de que nosotros como padres hispanos compartamos con nuestros hijos nuestro valioso lenguaje español.
1,Nice rythms for kids,"Nice rhythms for kids parties.Favorite songs:""Pinocho, Las Mananitas & Cumpleanos feliz"". In Spanish."
5,Too Bad It's Out of Print!,"This book is out of print, but if you find a copy, you should buy it (I will, too, since my copy is now falling apart). It has everything you might want to make for your babies and preschhoolers, from sweaters and dresses and playsuits to hats and toys and blankets. I have made many patterns from this book and all have been beautiful."
5,Horsez,"I bought this game for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!! In her words, it is challenging and it always keeps her busy. She says the cross-country jumping and show-jumping are her favorites because it seems so real."
2,Horsez,I bought the pc program for my seven year old granddaughter. However neither myself or my daughter (who is very good at software games ) could get the horse to move like we wanted. You must read the users guide and learn many key strokes to even start.
3,horse lovers review,i like it but... it's kinda hard at the part ware you go to the next week. K.D. 9 yrs.old
3,help!!!!!!!!!!!,can anyone tell me where in week 2 to find everyone but aurelie and when do u start training the foal. any response is appreciated
5,Brilliant sequel to Champion Dreams - First to Ride,"This game is in my opinion the BEST Riding Simulation ever. As a sequel to the enchanting Champion Dreams - First to Ride it completely fulfilled every expectation I had. A riveting storyline featuring known and new characters, challenging competitions as well as caring for a sweet little foal. An absolute delight to anyone who loves Riding Simulations or can't afford a horse. Buy it!"
1,IMisleading packaging,"This is *not* a horse riding and care game. It's a linear adventure game about people at a riding academy for preteens and older kids who really like horses. I never got very far in this game (I was trying to figure it out for my daughter). I gave up in disgust very early because the interface was very hard for me to figure out and the manual was of no help.I suspect the preteen girl crowd would enjoy this game if it ran correctly, but the box is horribly misleading."
1,Ugh.,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Yes, the graphics are pretty. Yes, its a ""cool horse game.""But it is VERY difficult. NOT for who they market it too. I'm a horse game nerd and I can't even get past the first week. Why? Because the glitches in the game make it almost impossible to do, the graphics are so much it slows down even the fastest computers and the writers expect you to be pyscic when you go on your games. Wayy to hard for anyone, and frusterating as well."
2,Horsez,I purchases this program for my granddaughter. She is a computer wiz and thought there would be no problem. There is really no instructions to explain how to use the program. So we found it kind of hard to play. The sender was great and it got here very quickly and no problems with that.
1,Not worth the money,"This game, when compared to other horse games such as Equestrian Dreams, My Horse and Me, and Lets Ride: Riding Star, was awful. The graphics are bad and the story line is so expected. If you are looking for a good horse game that has realistic graphics then don't buy this game."
5,Most overlooked book of short english fiction this century.,"While Joyce was still working on traditional prose in The Dubliners and Eliot hadn't entered his Waste Land, Wyndham Lewis wrote a series of short stories that shattered expectations of english writing. A correspondent of Pound, Eliot, Yeats and Joyce, Lewis was too prickly a personality to be accepted into the canon as they were. As with many great writers his achievement was too difficult and uncomfortable for society to accept.This collection prints the 9 stories about life in the Breton countryside as they were collected in 1927 and then follows them with the originally published stories from which they were revised. The prose still feels entirely new and strange, and, unlike most contemporary writing that tries to achieve that status, it is both entertaining and theoretically astute."
1,Major Disappointment!!!,"Please save your money and skip this book! I also bought it based on the claim to lower your blood pressure in a short time. Diet and exercise - good advice but hardly any secret. Page after page, issue after issue was the same disappointment. I feel thoroughly ripped off - I should have known better. Do net searches for your health issues and you'll find much more valuable information for free."
1,Dont buy this useless book,Trust me - dont buy this. A total waste of money. I guess I missed reading the other reviews otherwise I would have never bought this. Does not offer anything that everyone doesnt already know.
4,Beautiful Music,This CD features beautiful music that is relaxing and enjoyable listening. We particularly like the dulcimer.
3,Too orchestrated for me,I love hammered dulcimer -- Craig Duncan is an extremely talented musician -- I like the choice of pieces for this CD. However the orchestration of this CD -- the sweeping violins for instance -- is distracting to me and wasn't what I was looking for in what is classified as a folk CD. When next ordering a hammered dulcimer CD I'll make sure there are few other instruments.
4,Aussie Dogs Gabby Sheepskin Clog,"I have had a pair of Aussie Dogs for about six years and they are the most comfortable thing I have I ordered the Gabby clogs and a when they came they were extreemly tight, However after wearing them for a week they are streching and are becoming very comfortable like my old ones. They have good craftsmanship and are a great choice for around the house"
5,The price and value is well worth it!,They are the most comfortable thing I have.When ordering order a size smaller.
1,It does not explain a thing!,This book is confusing and gives bad examples. It does not go over how to do each step well and is hard to understand.
4,INMHO a very good CD,"Based on this CD I have bought other CDs by Biondi. As one of the other reviewers has stated - yes this is a fast pace. But listen to tracks 10-12 with the concerto for cello and violin. It has music to loose yourself in - Vivaldi at his best. I don't give it top marks simply because there are so many great works out there. All of the tracks are very good, but not all - for me - great as the cello/violin concerto. This is one of the CDs I often come back to."
2,"Works great, but is SUPER noisy","This dehumidifier was advertised as being quiet. That is not true. It is VERY noisy. It works well to rid my basement of moisture, however every time it kicks on I can hear it upstairs. It buzzes loudly the entire time it runs. I see that others are having this problem as well. I would NOT recommend this unit for that very reason. Absolutely terrible. The noise is quite annoying, especially when it kicks on overnight."
2,Didn't last as long as it should have,"Yes, it is REALLY loud, but we didn't mind because it was in our basement. We stacked heavy things on top of it to lower the noise and shaking. However, ours only lasted 6 years. Dehumidifers should last 10 years. It just kept running and not collecting any water. We expected more from Whirlpool and for the price.Oh, and here's a note on Whirlpool's bad customer service. I called Whirlpool, waited on hold for 45 minutes. The Whirlpool employee said they didn't make the dehumidifers and just sold their name to another company. They transferred me to the other company. The other company said they didn't make dehumidifers and transferred me back to Whirlpool. Waited another 45 minutes. Whirlpool employee gave us the name of a service technician. Service technician said it would cost around $400 to fix. Thanks for waisting our afternoon, Whirlpool."
5,Very quiet,I just purchased this from Lowes and have used it for about 2 weeks. I didn't find it loud at all so they must have made some changes since 2006. It works great. I have no complaints so far. The 5 year warranty is also nice.
2,Worked well for a while,"This is pretty much the only game in town for a cold environment (I have an insulated metal building in the Northwest). One previous Whirlpool model was not up to the task, freezing up and requiring auxiliary heaters, and a second one was involved in the recall of units that might cause a fire, so I finally got this one as number 3.It rattles a lot, but did work quite adequately for a couple of years. Then it just quit extracting water, even though the compressor runs and it otherwise behaves normally. I wrote the company via their ""support"" page with a question about getting this fixed or re-charged with coolant, and received no response.I am going to have to shop for a dehumidifier yet again, but it probably won't be this one... unless it's still the only one available for low-temp applications."
3,OK for the price,"I needed a stand for my Delta midi lathe and this one fit the bill. Assembly is straight forward so an 'exploded' view diagram is more than sufficient. All the pieces were there and everything fit well. It is sturdy enough for a midi lathe but a couple of sand bags on the lower support will firm things up a little. Note that the stand is delivered as pictured - With out shelves, drawers, mounting hardware, etc. I'm not sure why the previous reviewer would expect otherwise but I wish him luck finding a comparable stand with those features included for the price."
3,lathe stand,works great after I got it together. The product needs better instructions or numbers stamped to the different pieces
3,They open a bit too wide for my child's hands,"I love the idea that these scissors look like typical scissors and like ""adaptive"" scissors. I do not like that they open too far for my child with small hands to easily grasp the finger holds. Still better than the alternative."
2,Out of date,This book should either be revised or discontinued. It was published in 2002 and a lot of the information is no longer useful or relevant.
4,Medium Good,"Them music industry is a complicate and harsh environment and it is easy to fail at starting your own business. Fortunately there are books around that can help you reach your goal faster and with much more ease, and this is one of them. It covers a lot of the aspects, twists and turns in the music industry but it misses out on some very crucial points which are presented in ""Ty Cohen's Secrets to Making Money in the Music Industry (3-Piece Mega Audio CD Set)"" by Ty Cohen "" , a better and more detailed book about the subject, and an easier one too."
5,masterpiece,"J.K. Toole's work, written when he was 16 years old IS the great American novel. It should be studied by any serious student of English. Reading any of this man's limited work, strikes the heart with sadness at his early death. What volumes he could have produced!!!!!"
3,Written by a 15 year old kid.,"The story was found and published long after the author had passed on. He wrote it and put it away when he was just fifteen years of age. I was a bit curious and wanted to see what the fuss was about. Really not a bad first attempt, especially when you consider his age. The story itself is a ""coming of age "" account of the main character's life in the deep south around the time of WWII. The pictures he paints of his life ""thus far"" are sparse and thread bare. His resilient nature and penchant for giving a damn, ( for his mother and aunt) shape his fate. The bigotry, the poverty and the ignorance of his world have not completely polluted his vision of the ""one day"" or ""maybe then"", but the reader needs to remember that the author is just fifteen years old and has yet to develop any real hind sight."
5,genius,"I loved this book. It was so simple but yet so deep. There is just an under current of melancholy that runs through the work, it is brilliantly done, like previous reviewers it's hard to imagine a 16 year old penned it. The description is great but not overdone. It is an emotional read, a must read. It stands on its own beside COD."
3,Nothing to get excited about,"I would recommend this book only to the most avid fans of John Kennedy Toole. This story, written when the author was only 16, tells of a young man growing up in war years and the hardships he encounters in his lifetime. The plot itself is interesting at a very basic level and the characters are not developed as fully as they are in Confederacy, though I would call the story entertaining. It's not the story that is amazing, but rather that it was written by a 16 year-old. It is worth reading only to get a vague idea of the origins of the genius who wrote Confederacy. Otherwise, I wouldn't expect much."
5,Wonderful work from a Master,"I just finished reading The Neon Bible for the second time. Having read A Confederacy of Dunces years ago (and several times) I didn't know quite what to expect. Further, since I knew this was written at age 16 and withheld from print for years, I expected something a bit unpolished and simple. (To be honest I felt this might be another fine example of 20th Century money grubbing by hangers on.) This book is surely neither unpolished or simple. The story unfolds in a fashion that makes it hard to beleive that such a young author could have had so much inate skill. The charaters are real and well detailed. The story pulls you along but allows you to enjoy your trip. I cannot think of another book that fits in this class. The southern flavor compares well with Welty, Edgerton, O'Connor and Sams. Well worth the investment of reading it twice."
4,Insightful and sad.,"I was thrilled to find out that there was another novel in existence by the author of the funniest book ever written, Confederacy of Dunces. While this book is as insightful as Confederacy, it is sad, not funny, so don't expect the belly-laughs you got from Confederacy. But you should not skip this book either because even at 16, when Toole wrote this book, he was a great writer with even greater potential. It was a tragedy not just for him that he took his own life, but for us as readers."
4,DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND REPLACEMENT HEADS FOR THE TOOL IT COMES WITH?,"I LOVE THE BRUSH AND SPONGE THAT COME WITH THE TOOL, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND REPLACEMENT BRUSHES. IF I CAN'T FIND THEM THE WHOLE TOOL BECOMES USLESS."
3,Not a lot of steam but the accessories are good,This does not produce a lot of steam. It's just not worth leaning over it for 15 minutes for that little bit of steam. I feel like I get more out of hot towel. But the cleanser / exoliator brush are just as good as the expensive ones.
3,"Gave as a gift, she has one, they won't take it back, bummer.","I purchased this item for my daughter-in-law's birthday and she already has one. I inquired as to returning it and expected an easy return with credit back to my card as Amazon does, especially since I ordered it from Amazon.To my dismay, I can only get a credit from the company that sent it to me and I can't use any of their other products, so I'm stuck with something neither of us can use which is very disappointing.I will be very careful in the future about purchasing items through the mail/on-line that cannot be returned."
1,Don't Bother,"Wow, this is bad even by cheap romance novel standards. I am not sure why I bothered to finish reading it.Miles Leighton is a rude, unfriendly and very unlikeable financial wizard. Lexie Wallis is a whiney, annoying, and unlikeable realestate agent. They become stranded on a tropical island where Lexie falls in love with Miles who has amnesia. It is like a bad soap opera."
4,Looking for Peyton Place: Looking for Answers,"Dreading her homecoming to the small town she hates, Annie Barnes returns reluctantly to Middle River, New Hampshire, when her mother dies prematurely of symptoms that her sister is currently experiencing. Filled with busy bodies, the town believes Annie is there to dig up a story. They believe that their town served as the basis for the best-selling novel, ""Peyton Place"", and that Annie had come to disrupt their peaceful lives. Little do they know that Annie has other motives: to solve the mystery of her mother's death and to fight for the health and well-being of townspeople. Annie accomplishes this and finds much more. She finds love and discovers that she actually loves her hometown."
2,Very disappointing....,Very seldom do I give up on a book; I gave up on this one after several attempts to finish. I have read Barbara Delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books. I remember the fascination with the Peyton Place/Grace Metalious hoopla in the 50's and 60's so I was expecting to enjoy this story. It is dull and tiresome.
3,Missing something...,It was like drinking decaffeinated coffee...it lacks that ...oomphh. Didn't think the plot was that compelling. An editor should've chiseled it down by 200 pages.
2,Ho Hum,"I gave up on this one. Didn't like Annie, an egotistical writer who thought the whole town revolved around her miserable childhood there.None of the characters held my interest."
2,A Tedious Read,"I normally love Delinsky's romantic books, but this wasn't a romance. It was more like a tepid mystery. Annie Barnes returns to Middle River because her sister has the same symptoms her late mother had. She hates the town and they are suspicious of her because she wrote a bestseller. They think she's there to write about their dirty secrets and they're mean to her and....blah, blah, blah. That's how the redundant book sounded. It kept plodding over previously established areas until it got tired! The only good part came toward the end during a business meeting. Annie conversing with the dead author of Peyton Place went from a quirk to an irritation. This is not a typical, but wonderful Delinsky read. I guess she was trying for a mystery. She should stick to a good romance, which is what she does best."
3,Hang on! It is a slow start!!,"At first this bookhad a slow start. I really did not care what happened next. However, that characters start to become more interesting. I am definetly going to read the original ""Peyton Place"". This book sparks your interest in the previous book."
4,My first Delinsky novel,"Having never read Peyton Place, I didn't have the background that a lot of other people had reading this book. However, I did enjoy the book and it kept me turning the pages. It was my first Barbara Delinsky book, and although it was a little predictable, it was an easy to read and perfect for an afternoon at the beach."
4,Good Read!,"I don't understand the negative reviews of this book. I only gave it four stars because Annie (the main character)got so darned whiney about her past that I felt like yelling, ""Get over it!"", on several occasions, but the story was good. Barbara Delinsky writes descriptions of the scenes with her usual talent, the secondary characters are quite good, I loved the love interest/boyfriend character (although not the unprotected sex they have on their first encounter--anybody ever heard of an STD? HIV?). Overall, it was a good read, although I could have survived without the mental conversations with Grace--didn't really fit in with the story and made you question Annie's mental health at times, also just kind of popped up out of nowhere without any prior mention. Good book, overall with just a few weaknesses."
1,Save us from self important writers!,When I use to read BD novels I really felt like she understood people. This latest book is out churned formula writing about a long gone alcoholic viewed through the eyes of a snobby self important writer and her misery at returning home. The switch of view points from first person to third was annoying and I found it hard to like / understand any of the characters. Save yourself the money and skip this total waste of time.
2,Who cares about Peyton Place,"I have been a fan for many years. This book finds me on page 80 and not feeling as though I want to continue.Barbara, please find a new idea for your next book and not rely on anyone else."
2,Looking for the last page already,"It took well over 500 pages to write what should have been written in 300 or so pages, and in those last 200 pages, my interest was sorely flagging.I didn't find Annie particularly compelling on any level. Her personality, while supposedly she was the town pariah since her teens, was more milquetoast than troublemaker. How an entire town could come to despise her for vague things she did when she was young is beyond my comprehension.The exchanges between Annie and Grace Metalious were bizarre, and I didn't buy that they were the product of a creative writer-type.Frankly, I felt that the author basically used Ms. Metalious and her novel Peyton Place to piggyback on to sell this mediocre novel of her own.I would only recommend this book to a masochist."
2,not up to Delinsky's usual standards,"I'm with the other reviewers who did not enjoy this. As I have enjoyed many of Delinsky's other books, I expected a lot more from this. I was not really engaged in the characters or the story, and found the first person format somewhat jarring for some reason."
1,Couldn't make it through...,"I LOVE Barbara Delinsky, but I think this had to be her worst ever. Coast Road, Lake News, The Vineyard, The Summer I Dared....they're all fabulous but this one I couldn't even finish.My rule with books is that if I don't like it by page 100 or don't understand what's going on by then, put it down.Well, I tried past 100 and went to 200 and still didn't like it. I didn't understand the point or the characters. There were so many characters and she got so absorbed in describing the characters *who were all townspeople anyway* that I just got lost (and bored).So if you have the patience to continue on with this book, more power to you.If I like a book, I read it fast. If I don't, it takes forever and this one would have taken forever.Sorry, Barbara, this one wasn't you."
2,At first it was great,Sad to say that after 2 ueses its showing signs of rust. I hand wash and dry but something has caused the lager pot to hold on to rust spots.
4,slow boil,"I have a new gas stove. My pasta pot was of cheap construction. It took forever to boil water. I bought this new Progressive system and it looks top notch. I found, however, that it took forever to boil water with it as well. I'm not sure what in blazes is happening. Other than my issue, I'm pleased with the product."
2,Pitted,"After the first time I used this pot, I saw that it was pitted on the bottom of it. I will not buy another one from this company."
3,Could be better,"I love this type of utinsel, but it burns the bottom of whatever I'm cooking. It seems to be very thin."
2,Started to rust after first use,"I purchased this at a good price thinking I can use it to boil pasta, steam veggies and it works for all those things. My only complaint is that rust spots started to appear after its first use and wash. Since I purchased it at a good price I'm not complaining too much, just be sure to wipe it down after washing and use a good scrubber to scrub out the rust stains while washing."
1,How can Stainless Steel Rust?,"I have used the pot one time and it has already started to rust where the bottom of the pasta strainer comes in contact with the pot itself. If it is stainless steel, how is it rusting?I will be sending it back!"
2,Stainless except for rust!!,"The size is great, the design works well, but after only a few uses, the ""stainless steel"" is rusting. I'll be returning it."
1,Used once and pitched it out,"Poor construction. After one dishwasher cleaning, developed rust spots. Ended up being an expensive proposition since I had to go out and buy another one."
4,Snack attack,This is a great book for kids who are learning to cook and like to be creative. Each snack has a mini lesson with it that if used properly can be very useful for teaching. We use this for home-schooling as a lesson in home economics its awesome.
2,where is the passion?,"La Forza is a difficult opera to stage. The plot is not really exciting to present day audiences, but the music is one of the best Verdi composed, beautiful solos, duets and ensembles. According to Verdi: ""the singers must have soul, understand the words and express their meaning. That's where this production fails; there is no passion in the singing or in acting. Urmana tries her best but the male singers are ""just there"", no passion. These days of DVDs and close-ups we expect the singers/actors to convey passion and emotions, and in this production they are not there. Even more, the incredible overture Verdi composed for this opera, considered by some as the best he ever composed, lacks conviction and does not create the tension needed for what will follow.Still, if you haven't gone to La Forza before, it is good enough to introduce you to the opera wishing a better production will appear on DVD in the future."
3,Not so much that I hadn't heard before,"I ordered this book with high hopes that during my school breaks, I'd be able to travel all around without missing student loan payments...nope. I felt that much of the information provided is not any great breakthrough, such as offering to be bumped to get a free flight, or signing up for a frequent flyer program. I had heard of that before reading this book, and I am not a seasoned airline traveler. Most of that information, I had read in the front section of all those ""Let's Go"" travel guides. The book, however, is a good resource for locating courier agencies and he does mentions some low cost domestic airlines. I read the sixth edition, which is a bit outdated- it mentions Valujet as one of the low-cost airlines and many of the travel agencies the author recommended in my area are no longer in operation. I'm hoping that the seventh edition will provide more resources."
5,A Must For Every Traveler!,"I wish I had a copy of this book seven years ago when I went to Denmark. It was my first time out of the USA. This book would have not only explained options to me that I didn't know I had, but also would have saved me a ton of money. It is simple to understand and I like the fact that it list not only different airlines and options, but prices as well. I can see why this book has been printed so many times as the information it contains is so beneficial to everyone. Anyone who travels should possess this informative book."
5,All in the Family,"Judith McMonigle Flynn and her cousin Renie have reluctantly agreed to cater their Uncle Boo's 75th. birthday party. They show up and are treated like servants instead of the relatives that they are. When the birthday celebration is over, the guest of honor disappears into his study and is later found shot to death. Judith's colorful relatives offer no end of possibilities as far as suspects go, and she, as usual, decides to do her own investigating. Her policeman husband Joe's chief rival is assigned to the case, which makes Judith even more determined to find out who the killer is. This is one of the best-written of the Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery series and is a very enjoyable read."
5,A Forgotten Great Player,"Richie Asburn was a beloved Phillie. Due to the franchise's lowly status, it took him 33 years after retiring to be inducted into Cooperstown. For those who saw him play, Ashburn was one of the best center fielders of his generation and adored in Philadelphia. After his playing days, he became a broadcaster for the Phillies, endearing himself to another generation for his work beind the microphone.A devoted Phillies fan, Fran reminds us just how great Richie was and what he meant to the team and city. A solid book looking back at the low-key but stellar career of a legend.Bought this book for my father, who absolutely adores it."
5,Excellent book,"I totally agree with the reviewer: if you want to do some development in Open Source Project, this book will build a solid base for you. For one example, PHP4 is a very popular server side scripting language and it uses all these great tools to make build process straightforward.Cheers!"
2,"they know their stuff, they can't communicate it","if you had three books on the GNU build system and were ready to delve into the arcane details, this would be an excellent book.if you are looking to learn how to use automake and autoconf to manage a small to midsized project, this book is worthless. the authors jump from the basics to esoteric problem cases and back frequently, and there is no help for those who do not already know the system well."
5,Great product!,I love this case. It protects the gigabeat and is very sturdy. I don't have to worry about my screen getting damaged. Exactly what I was looking for.
1,Lobeman or Lameman?,Tuner is very weak and will not lock on to less than very strong signals. Reception is often filled with static. Save your money.
3,Sliding back into similarity.,"Sang-Son Park, The Tarot Cafe, vol. 4 (Tokyopop, 2003)I have to say that I'm writing this review a goodly amount of time after I read the book itself, and what I have learned from doing so is that the fourth volume of this series did not leave nearly as much of an impression on me as did volumes 2 and 3. It's enjoyable, and if you've been going along with the series you'll certainly want to pick this up, but it seems to have backed off a notch in the interest-and-innovation department.While there is a main story here, the real focus of the book is on revealing more of Pamela's storyline, which is rapidly growing complex. The problem is that just as things are starting to get to the point where you're going to need an ""on last week's episode..."" summary at the beginning of every issue, some of the flaws in the first volume (the main one by far being difficulty telling the characters apart) crop back up. Still, if you've come this far, you'll keep going. **"
5,Nice series,"This series remains nice. As said by the other reviewers things are told about Pamela's past. Her interaction with Belus is very hilarious, they are a cute couple! This fourth volume is a little different, because there is now more focus on Pamela's story, but it is an interesting one, so no complaints. Next: volume 5!"
1,No Stars for This Star,"While this book has some valid points, it is a dull dry affair with all the excitement of watching paint dry. Reading it made me jealous of illiterate people. My question is, do the editors REALLY think ANYONE would buy this book for $65? (not counting forcing their students to buy it...) All in all a good example of why i thank god i am no longer in college, and forced to read works like this by professors who enjoy torturing their students. Save your money."
3,Have magnifying glass ready.,Not quite sure what to say about the product. But I do advise you to have a magnifying glass with you. The instructions are absolutely miniscue. Talk about eye strain. Wow.
2,regular,el producto llego como en la foto pero la brujula el norte dice sur y viceversa osea no marca como deberia esta mala lo demas si esta en perfecto estado
2,Cheaper isn't always better.,"The sound in this particular re-issue of RCA's 1970 AIDA makes listening a frustrating experience. Don't let the lower price lure you. It's worth the extra money to hear clear high notes, orchestral climaxes, etc. If you're interested in the recorded performance itself, see my review of the older, full-price CD issue."
2,No questions answered by this book,"As a developer you better check the knowledge base of Business Objects, post in their news groups and/or if you are a registered user ask/email their consultants.Perhaps some ""missing"" information is covered somewhere in the book but if so the index must be very poor.The book should be titled the ""Totally Incomplete CR9 Reference""."
2,Remarkably incomplete for developers (or anyone else!),Has provided little more than the basics despite substantial girth. Especially disappointing are the few pages devoted to VB. Contains no mention whatsoever of .ttx files. The index is also poor for a volume that masquerades a reference tool.
4,Good reference--Let's be fair,"For critics of this book, the author explains in the preface that calling this book ""complete"" is a marketing tool--albeit one that is a bit misleading--and that there is no way a reference on Crystal Reports will be ""complete"" enough to answer every single quesion. Granted there are ways the book could be improved (more screen shots, more typical scenarios, etc) but so far this is the best CR 9.0 book that I have found. Perhaps book publishers should consider this."
2,"""Complete Reference"" - NOT","When I hear the word OR read the word ""complete"", I tend to believe that's exactly what it is ... complete. This book, however, quite often refers you to the online help and does not give adequate information about the existing functions methods that are currently in the Crystal Reports. ""The Complete Reference"" means I can look up any function and read a description of what that function does and how to use it. This book does not provide that. Furthermore, I have previous versions of Crystal Complete Reference and this book, along with others repeats the EXACT wording out of those other books. I figure, I can understand why because it's accumulative, but, I would rather have a separate book with JUST the new features."
2,Definitely not for a young toddler!,"I got this toy for my daughter for her first birthday. It is adorable - I love wooden puzzles. However, it is far too difficult for a child that young to put this puzzle together. The pieces have too many curves and angles sticking out. My daughter loved taking the pets out and carrying them around with her, but she wasn't able to put them back in until she was about 19 months old, whereas, she was able to do other puzzles with simpler shapes at 13 months. So, if you are looking to buy for an older toddler, this might be a good choice...if it wasn't only a 3-piece puzzle. My daughter is 2 now, and she never chooses this puzzle, there aren't enough pieces to keep her interested. The puzzle looks great, but it fails to entertain the age group it was aimed at. One-year olds can't do it, and two-year olds don't want to!"
2,This toy is not for 12 months it is more like 24 months,We got this puzzle as a gift for my son. The knob size is good but the shapes are much too complex for a 12 month old to line up. My son understands what to do with the pieces but all the little edges and corners make it much too difficult for him to fit it where he goes. He ends up mad at the toy. The pieces are very thin as well. I would recommend this but only for a child around 24 months old
3,not bad at all,"I got this toy for my 11 month old and although the parts have to be really put in,she knows that these parts go with this toy.She tries to put them in but if you do not force them in they will not fit.Overall she has learned the different names of the animals.I think in time she wil get it."
5,One-Year-Old Loves It,"My grandson who just turned one loves this puzzle. The design is attractive, the size is small enough for a child to easily get out of his puzzle drawer, and the characters are adorable. My grandson has no trouble grasping the knobs on each piece, and fitting the pieces back into the puzzle after he's had a good chew."
3,Great Story Needs updating,This is a great Story that goes well with the book by the same name. The only downfall is that it is so ooooolllldddd! The music is early '80 and a little louder than the narration. It would be great if they could update it and put it in DVD form. Other wise my 4 year old still likes to watch it while looking at the book. She doesn't know the music is out of date!
2,Too Expensive - Does not meet market need,"Face it -- Doctor Who fans come in all different shapes and sizes and very few of us can stomach spending $600+ bucks for episodes we probably won't want to watch.My suggestion would be to box (parse) the series according to the Doctor's resurrection. Perhaps include the last episode of the previous doctor and the first of the next -- if it makes sense to do so.Afterall, most of us are fans of a particular doctor -- for me, I'd buy the ""Tom Baker"" and ""Peter Davidson"" years but probably not the others. (No offense to the other doctors.)In the long run, BBC would sell a lot more DVDs.Also, I really don't like the fact that all the collections don't contain ALL of the episodes of a given season.Now that the new Doctor Whos are on air in the US again, I think it would be worth the BBC's effort to get the historical ones correct. My kids LOVE the new Doctor (as do I) and now they have an interest in the previous doctors as well."
2,"""This is all getting a bit silly...""","Well, if you've just discovered the British Sci-Fi/Family series, than this is the gift for you all. All DVDs included have superior sound and picture and an excellent set of extras. But to purchase the entire range of R1 Doctor Who DVDs for $600 is a bit pricey..."
5,AMAZING,This Item came better on how it was described. It came before the date. It came in a since big plastic covering and in a huge package. It was nicely protected. Great item. Its a must have.
2,"NOT WORTH THE VIEWING TIME, OR THE COST TO PURCHASE","Much of the filming was done in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, where we own a summer home. The filming was done in the summer of 2009, and we have been anxiously waiting for the DVD to come on the market.What a disappointment!We did not even watch the entire film.Very boring!"
1,a travesty,It's a pity they don't allow 0 stars as this turkey would rate that. I wonder if the writers or director bothered to actually read even an abridged version of the great novel. Avoid this and hold out for a remastered Blu-ray release of the brilliant 1956 film with Peck as Ahab. Not perfect but far better than any since.
5,Moby Dick,love this story and the movie does it justice and my favorite actor Billy Boyd has a small part in it so of course I love it thanks
5,Poignant thesis!,"The author cites many examples to buttress his argument that America is squandering its goodwill. However, there is no mention of the Peace Corps, which continues to provde many of America's best 'envoys'."
4,Expanding home phone network,I already had a similar unit. That's why when one of my phones broke I decided to replace with this one since it was almost the same price and included a radio/alarm clock. The radio/alarm clock is basic but you are able to have 5 radio stations in memory. It's reliable. I've had a unit in my set of phones for over 3 years without any issues. There are newer phone models released but this one isn't short on any features. The phone itself is 5 stars. The speaker phone is loud and clear. The caller ID and phone book works like a charm. I would buy this phone again.
1,Not happy about company policy,I inadvertantly ordered the wrong expansion phone and had to return this. I was charged 15% restocking fee. That didn't seem quite fair. It wasn't damaged or used or touched except to unwrap it far enough to see that it was the wrong phone.
3,No back lighting on the clock -- Useless!,i was interested in this product but since i has no backlit clock -- no sale.
5,Great as Always!,This is a great Sister Hazel cd. All songs are good. I would expect nothing less from them.
1,watch band broke in a week - poor quality,The watch band is very poor quality since the pins do not attach properly to the watch itself. We returned it and we were refunded.
4,A good book for begineer,"I love this book very much. Colorful, user-friendly and simple to read. If you are the begineer of VB, I recommend this book. You do not need to spend a lot of time to study those thick and professional level in this moment. Get the concept, do more exercises and then you will become an experienced programmer. After that, start to read the professional and thick one."
1,Very little worth reading or reccomending,"I was very disappointed in this book, which covers Illustrator 9 in a very broad sense. It seems to be saying ""look what people are doing with Illustrator"" instead of ""look what YOU can do with Illustrator."" An excellent marketing tool for Illustrator, but a feeble attempt at actually helping you to understand techniques or other capabilities."
2,Not Particularly Helpful.,"This is one of those books that looks great on the shelf, and seems like a can't-miss. But when you get it home and crack it open, it really doesn't help you to learn.Much of the problem is the book's approach. Much of the book is essentially a good-looking elaboration upon the manual. I find that you really don't learn anything by reading lists of commands and features. You learn by following tutorials and doing.This book has comparatively few tutorials, and those that it has are fairly sketchy.Many of the illustrations are nice. I would have traded everything else away for, say, 5 extremely in-depth tutorials on how to recreate 5 of the most complex, attractive pictures in the book."
1,Full Color! Loads of Pictures! Little Content!,"I loved the format of the book and full color drawings. Even the paper quality is excellent! You might think since the book looks so good that everything that is in the book is clear and precise and right.......BUT!!The surprise comes with the written material. Out of 40+ Illustrations and text, I can honestly say that for 10 of them I had NO Idea what they were talking about and 15 were created primarily with other software like Photoshop or plug ins (Both of which are barely covered in the book). The examples and ""techniques"" are NOT anywhere near what you will have to face in the real world if you plan to use Illustrator."
1,"Love that art, hate the rest","The samples in this book look great! It has the best graphics I've seen in any Illustrator book. Unfortunately that's where the book stops being good. The book seems to be missing the ""Meat"". I actually regret buying this book, next time I will read the first chapter of a book before buying it. You can't judge a book by it's cover, or the graphics inside! Hope this review helps anyone trying to decide what book to buy. It is severely lacking for a comprehensive Illustrator book. It really seems like this book was written for Illustrator 8, as none of the new features in Illustrator 9 seem to be covered. Any of the examples can be done in Illustrator 8, verbatim. I agree with the guy in another review - this thing is even less useful than the manual that comes with the program, and not much better looking. I would suggest any potential buyers to seriously look at other books before buying this one."
2,"Is it me? No, it's the book.","This book looks fantastic. However, the more you read, the less information is there. I was particularly intrigued with the title of the chapter ""The Zen of Illustrator"" until I discovered that it was a cleverly named ""intro to Adobe Illustrator"" chapter. That chapter was the most useful in the book, although I got much more from the Illustrator for Dummies book (which was also much clearer, and had better examples).The rest of the book is just filler. Where are the detailed step by step examples? I don't care what's going on in these artists' heads, I want to know exactly HOW they did this stuff in Illustrator. Disappointing."
3,It's a good visual,but if you really want to learn how to use Illustrator 9 then I would get the Adobe class room in a book I believe it is a better at doing the job instead of this one. Wow is a good reference book to skim through thoe
1,This is why digital grahpic artists get a bad rap,"After looking through these reviews, I feel I had to add my own two cents. Anyone who thinks this book is ""wonderful"" is not a ""real"" user of this product, and they certainly won't be by using this book as their reference. Many of the less positive reviews still cite the artwork as being ""fantastic"" or ""excellent"", but this is simply not the case. I would go with ""adequate"" myself.The first section of the book is an attempt to mystify Illustrator in some way to make it seem more useable. However, all it serves to do is add confusion to an already difficult program.If you really want to see some great art created with Illustrator, just page through a magazine and look at the ads and title typography. You'll learn a lot more than you will from this book."
1,Uninspiring,This just didn't get my creative juices flowing. I was also disappointed in the number of sections on new 9 features.
1,Avoid this book if you are a beginner,Hey... I'm not stupid. But this book sure makes Illustrator 9.0 a bit intimidating to the beginner. I wish I would have spent my money on a book that would have been more useful to me.
1,Racism,"Read the very last line. She uses the 'N' word, implying that black women are inferior to white (especially in terms of beauty).I'm sure some readers justify this as a sign of her (L.M. Montgomery) era. She wrote the book in 1931 - less than 30 years before the U.S.'s Civil Rights movement - not 1731. I expect better of an author was well-read, and for that era, educated."
5,"Next to 'The Blue Castle,' this is my favorite.","I love LMM's portrayals of big families (like in the Pat books, the Emily books, or 'Magic for Marigold') and this one is just hilarious. I wonder where she came up woth so many characters."
3,Good to know,"This a science book about sex in the animal world. Well written and with a spicy touch, it opens you mind to men and women behaviour in bed (and outside it). Once read, you realize that sex has much to do with the Evolution of Species, besides romantic love. So I missed more references to Darwin work."
1,Humans are quite different from birds,"What makes us different from birds and animals is our ability to feel compassion towards one another. A biological explanation of polygamy in birds and animals does little to prove that humans should mindlessly follow their own animal nature. If we did, we wouldn't be much different from animals. Ability to spare our loved ones of the deep hurt that is inevitably caused by infidelity, - and ability to restrain our animal instincts out of compassion towards another human being, - is what makes us human."
2,One Good Dance Will Not Save A Show,"This is the story of an Indian dance instructor living in the US. She goes to India to pay respects to her dying guru and eventually save his favorite theater, which otherwise would have been converted into a shopping mall.An admirable theme with many careless holes. No wonder it was a flop in India. Madhuri's character comes out to be a know-it-all, stuck-up ego-maniac throughout.Would an Indian dancer trained in authentic dance run a Westernized dance school in the US like she does, or proudly run a school of Indian dance? When she goes to a rural area or small town in India, will she wear tight jeans and low-cut tops? Wouldn't she be proud to be an Indian role model, especially because she is the mother a young girl?The best aspect of the film is the title song and dance, which saved the show somewhat. The singers' voices in all of the songs are very effective.One good dance will not save a movie."
5,India Arts,"I loved this movie,really enjoy India woman dancing and singing.Was a very good movie,really enjoyed it very much.I watched it many times."
2,MD's comeback movie?,"The extraordinary super star of Bollywood, Madhuri Dixit (MD), makes a comeback in this movie. It is an uninteresting story of her guru (Darshan Jariwala) whose dying wish it is that his theatre should continue.They plan a mega performance after his passing away, and MD directs and acts in it. Apart from her awesome acting and screen presence, Konkana Sen Sharma has given a fine performance.The finale is a mega performance but unfortunately does not have memorable music or lyrics. It is a forgettable event and finally sinks a movie which was in any case meandering along.The movie is for only those who are diehard Madhuri Dixit fans."
5,Excellent CD for all levels,"The music on this recording is pretty, easy to count, and varying in measure structure. This is the best ballet cd I have ever heard. Liner notes even include which song applies to what type of combination. (i.e. plie, tendu, and battements, etc) Excellent for all levels."
2,"OK Lady, it's your mountain",The usual pretentious stuff from Leiohu. Another example of a spiritual leader who is not admitting something to herself.
3,Not Lei'Ohu's Best,"I did not like this CD as much as Lei'Ohu Ryder's ""Love Returns"", which for me is very spirtual. If you have ""Love Returns"", I would recommend not purchasing Lady of the Mountain, since I think you will be disappointed."
5,beats sunless tanners hands down,"This is wonderful stuff. Easy to use, lasts for three days or more unless you remove it with soap and water. Easy to apply--just spray into your hand and smooth it onto your legs quickly (it dries fast). I use tan glow on pretty white legs, and it looks completely natural. Does not come off on my clothes or sheets."
1,This pan leaks water!,"The design of the fish poacher is great, and when I used it for the first time I actually poached two trout in it. They were delicious.But then I discovered that the pan had leaked about a half cup of water during the 7 minutes it was on the burners. The water nearly extinguished one of the two gas burners under the pan!I emptied, washed, and dried the pan, then put an inch of water in it and put it over my kitchen sink. Sure enough, it leaked because it has a hairline crack in the bottom toward one end. Poorly made!"
3,Little poacher,"The product is fine. It's too small for a large piece of fish, so I'll still need to get another larger poacher."
5,extraordinarily pedagogic on tough topic,"I am a CFA candidate (also holds MBA). Thi is a required book and it is wonderfully written for practicioners but with a strong conceptual and technical framework. You learn a lot on global finance. The teaching concept with LOS, well defined concepts and tools,a wealth of problems (with solution) with direct relevance to both theory and practice is a great success. Plus Prof Solnik is regarded as a star in research but also among major global asset managers and pension funds. Helped a lot for my CFA exam (far superior to prep schools) and also my current job in asset management. I will not resale it!"
4,review,"I still have not recieved this product, so it is late. But I am really looking forward to this!"
4,it was a very good book,this was the first book by Emily Carmichael that I have read. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading her other ones. It is set in the old west which is one of my favorite time periods plus it had alot of humor which I always like in my books
1,Shotty Craftsmanship,"I bought this, not only for the price point, but the color also matched every thing of charlie's... however after snapping it on the diaper bag, within minutes the snap pulled out of the fabric... rendering it perfectly useless to me. Did not actually measure the dimensions given on the add, and does not fit Tommmee Tippee Bottles at all. I had called about returning the product for a replacement, and well the woman was beyond rude !!! i cant believe there is a $3 restocking fee on a $6 item?!?!?!!?! needless to say i am very disappointed, i have to return it just to have wasted my time and my money !!!"
1,Incorrect dimensions - reluctant service,"This tote is not 10"" tall as listed - its only about 9"" tall. Very few bottles can fit in it comfortably and mine certainly didn't. I ordered it based on the measurements and was disappointed to find them inaccurate.A message sent to The Baby's Gallerie did not elicit any communication from the seller at first - just a postage due return address label. Does Amazon let sellers get away with unfair return policies like: a standard $2.99 restocking fee even when the item is different from website description? Or ship the item back to us and we will see about a refund? E*** never would! Interestingly, the seller has listed the same item on E*** but described it there as 9"" tall approx. ???UPDATE: After much reluctance the seller refunded in full."
4,Some gems,"All of this music was new to me before listening to this disc. I assume the performances are definitive, so the issue is, how attractive is the music itself? To me the winner on this CD is track 4, De Profundis, almost 7 minutes of austere beauty for organ, small choir and remarkably effective percussion (bell and gong). Track 6, the Summa (Credo) is nice, but the music seems to be content to create a somewhat mystical mood, and does not reflect the text (like many mass Credos do). The major work on the disc is track 8, the Stabat Mater, a very austere piece. It has not won me over yet."
5,What is Architecture,An absolutely brilliant book. Highly recommended for those who see architecture as hobbby as well as those who have been in the profession for years. Truly refreshing and innovative.
2,Far from the best. Barely watchable.,"If you are looking at this, I assume you are familiar with the Seduction Cinema line. This isn't awful, it is Julian Wells effort to write a film. It's kind of funny, barely, in parts. Julian is a very beautiful woman, and spends most of the movie looking not beautiful. Stupid hosts, lame singing (they couln't get permission to use real songs, so the music in this show is so bad it's a sonic assault.) Kimbo the gorilla makes his biggest appearance I've seen to date, and of course, John Link is here as well.The naked girl lesbian stuff is always nice, and that is the whole reason for renting these things. Unfortunately, the stuff in between is voluminious and distracting. For die hard Misty and Julian fans. Fortunately, I'm one of those."
1,Used for 5 minutes.,Was bought at a Toys R Us as a Christmas gift (receipt was accidentally washed the next day!). Plugged it in on Christmas Eve and used it for about 5 minutes when it quit working. Tried to exchange it to be told that it was out of stock until the end of January (after calling ahead to make sure that there was one in stock that I could exchange it with before hitting the road for a 45 minute drive!). It is now March and still not in stock.The only reason that I bought this particular hard mat was because the salesman insisted that it was the most durable. Boy they got me and my $100.
1,Very dissatisfied,I can't say whether Amazon was sending me defective merchandise or whether it was damaged in shipping but the platforms I've recieved had 1 or several sensors malfunctioning.
4,Working pretty good so far,"Our kids got it for Christmas. It is now late January and we have only had 1 problem with it. Once, in the first week we had it, it got stuck doing a continuous up arrow. After I pushed around on the back a few times, unplugged it and reset the PS2, it stopped and has been fine since. We have three kids. One uses it regularly, and several of their friends have come over and played as well. It doesn't seem to always sense when you hit the arrow unless you hit dead center. Overall it's doing fine, we are happy with it and the kids are getting some exercise!"
1,Defective out of Box,"Purchased this item at a ToysRUs store that is going out of business. No return & No exchanges & blacked out bar code (ARRRGHHH).After about 30 secs of use, the xbox thinks the pad is unplugged. Probably a loose wire inside the pad.Probably only durable for a 50lb child.Welded aluminum frame with VERY ugly ground down welds. Very unprofessional looking. Almost makes it look home made. I can barely weld at work, but I could do a better welding/grinding job than INTEC did.Going to try to return/exchange anyways..."
5,Written by 2 internationally recognized experts.,"There was a desparate need for a book pitched at the general audience -- until now.The 1st edition of McElhinny's book was heralded as a ""classic and definitive text"". It thoroughly discussed the theory of geomagnetism, the geologic reversals of the Earth's magnetic field, and the shifting of magnetic poles. In the 26 years since the highly successful first edition of Palaeomagnetism and Plate Tectonics (Cambridge, 1973) the many advances in the concepts, methodology, and insights into paleomagnetism warrant this new treatment. This completely updated and revised edition will be a welcome resource for a broad audience of earth scientists as well as laypeople curious about magnetism, paleogeography, geology, and plate tectonics.I particularly enjoyed the set of Chris Scotese's color paleogeographic maps covering the past 250 million years."
4,Good for Name-Recognition,"Got this plaque for my daughter's birthday so that she would learn to recognize her name. She was really excited at first, but hardly notices it now. She is able to recognize her name though... so who knows!"
4,Favorite Canadians since Propagandhi,"Sure they're not alike at all, and of course no disrespect to the Planet Smashers, but the Flatliners are some fun kids. I only saw them yesterday and had their cd a mere week before that, but I've grown to love this cd.Heavy, heavy Suicide Machines influence with some blistering Streetlight Manifesto lyrics thrown at you. How could you go wrong?"
5,They Just Saved Canada,"The flatliners are probably the best band to ever come out of Canada. And its about time, all those poor Canadians who are associated with Avril Lavign (dont know how to spell that, dont care) and Simple Plan. Now canadians have something to be proud of. Keep rocking guys."
3,A bit hard to get into the story,This book skips around a lot. I thought that it wasn't up to the 'good read' I've come to expect from this author.
3,Okay but rather dated,The version we got is the 1995 edition and is good for a backup chart ... but doesn't reflect the dozens of chart updates made since waters around Vieques were opened to cruisers and sailors. We're somewhat disappointed.
5,Thank you for the new edition!,"Many thanks to Garret Romaine and Tim Fisher for taking the time and energy to update the information in the book, as well as adding their own expertise. The most recent edition is accurate, the maps and descriptions are updated, and the inclusion of GPS coordinates and information on what each site has are invaluable in planning a day trip for collecting. This book is again worth the investment!"
4,Excellent Oregon Rockhounding Resource,"I know, a couple of people have a bee in their bonnets and are having a hissy fit trying to pooh pooh this book. Ignore them. This book is an excellent resource (especially for the small price) to consult in preparing a family trip. We've used it numerous times. We've also used a variety of other materials. For less than the cost of a lunch, we received great value to enhance our outdoors activities. Now, the Washington version of this series, that was a disappointment. That definitely was not money well spent and, in fact, was counter-productive (think wild goose chase)."
5,Excellent Book!,This is an excellent guide to rockhounding sites in Oregon. The information and directions are accurate and up to date and the book is written in a style that is easy to follow.
2,A little disappointed,"The directions in this book are way to vague. We found ourselves quite lost a number of times and there was a street that wasn't in existence. I was also not happy with the lack of land markers and detail to find the sites. I have bought other gem trail books for other states, I found the sites with ease and the pictures were very informative as well."
2,VERY general guide to Oregon area rockhounding,"This book is only good for getting the names of places to go rockhounding at. Once you get the place names, then you'll have to look elsewhere to get any other useful information. At first I thought this book would end up being a big help, but when it came down to planning trips and actually going to these places I found that this book is just a bunch of, well, lies. About a fifth of the maps are okay. Better than half of the maps are inaccurate to the point of being useless. There are a couple maps (which I found, at least) that appear to be completely fictitious. The entire value of this book lies in its index of mineral types and location names. Not even close to being worth the price."
4,HELPS you pass the DBO Exam,"All other reviewers have complained about either being confused or unhappy with the content of this book. As in all other certification books that I have read, this book alone will not pass the test. However if you use this book as a guide for the testing material, which is what it is designed for , and use other materials (such as: DBA Handbook, Hands on experience, and Self-Test Software's exam simulations) you will pass the exam. I did. Book does have a few typos in it so I can't give it five stars but all in all it was what I needed to make sure I was prepared for the exam."
4,I passed both the dbo and internet dbo exam with this book.,This book was great. You need the software and this book in order to pass the test. I recommend reading the book a couple of time to really understand Oracle. Remember Oracle recommends you have 6 month hands on experience before taking the test.
5,title does not match cover art or review,"title is database administrator, cover art and review is for the database *operator* exam."
3,"Good, but has a few flaws.","While it is a VERY informative read, not worth [money] though, it suffers from a flew flaws.1. Lack of pictures. There are several, but there really should have been more.2. No index.3. There is prety much NO info on the M134, which is what I was looking forward too. Although the guns that are described are much more powerful, there should have been some information on this.Try to find a used copy, because it isn't worth the normal price."
3,"Great Charles Bronson movie, but...","I have been waiting for a good DVD release on this movie for a long time. I spotted this Marketplace PAL release. I took a chance and purchased it and was disappointed in this Australian release. It was the same as watching a old VHS tape and NOT worth the purchase price, so, I am still waiting for a U.S. release."
2,Big numbers don't deliver better results,"If you read the marketing hype it sounds as though the 5.8GHz frequency is better than all others, but this is not true! Actually 900GHz is the best for reception distance. I thought this will still have decent reception from the base set to the hand set, and the unit had other bells and whistles, so I bought it. The reception is very poor and you don't have to move very far at all from the base station before the signal starts fading. The signal booster and the voice enhancer don't help much. Actually the need for such functions indicates the weakness itself.Buy it if you are only going to use it in a single story house and need an answering machine integrated with your phone. If you want to move around freely outside your home without losing signal quality, look elsewhere. Also the handset can only store 10 phone numbers."
5,Better than the 5100 series,"The 5240 series improves on the excellent 5110M ( the previous generation). Things that are better :1. Smaller handset design.2. Better battery.3. Backlighting better, and display sharper.4. Talking caller ID is neat.5. Ability to download contacts form Outlook to the phone (through a paid service).6. Call quality about the same as the 5110 series (I strongly recomend that you check out those reviews as well).Negatives :1. No LCD on the base. However, talking caller id helps.2. The voice enhancer can make people sound funny. Then again, turning it off is a metter of pressing one button.Bottom Like :This is the best 5.8Ghz set you can buy."
2,The very bad kills the very good!,"First the good: The features are extensive and relatively easy to use. The user-interface is clean. It does not interfere with WiFi, and it perfect for almost everyone.Now the bad: The sound quality experienced by the CALLER is dreadful. Syllables are garbled, eaten, and mashed with a meat cleaver. Received sound is fine.I loved the unit, but all my friends (callers) hated it with a passion, and I returned it for a full refund because it was within the 30 Day period. Forget the 1 year warrantee, which forces you to deal with Panasonic. You will get a refurbished unit with the same design flaws."
1,horrible sound quality,"A friend spent a long time deciding what new cordless system to purchase to replace his older Siemens 2.4Ghz system. He excitedly ordered this phone from Amazon when it was available and set it up right away without any issues. Then he started making phone calls. He must have called me about a dozen times one day to test out the sound quality. Every time he called me it sounded horrible. It sounded as though he was on an old bad quality cell phone. He was garbled and hard to understand. And that's sitting in the same room as the base station. He called Panasonic support and they recommended that he move the base station further away from other electronics, like the computer. He did this and still no improvement. So he is now returning the Panasonic phone and buying the Uniden TRU8885. Will have to see if that one is any better."
2,Under water transmission,"Great phone if you are away from the base. If the base is located on a desk, nightstand etc., your voice will be ""underwater"" on the handset untill you move at least 3 feet away or more. Panasonic is aware of the problem and they will repair or replace the defective phone...if you send it to them."
3,Average phone but too expansive.,Battery life is not that good. I lasts few hours. Speaker phone volume is low. The earphone is noisy. Mic is not that powerful. Handset is bit bulky.
2,5.8GHz Static Problems,"I chose the 5.8GHz DSS because I needed a phone that wouldn't interfere with a wireless network. After a short time using the phone, my callers started complaining of static distorting my voice. I didn't hear it on my end, but people on the other end did. And this was before the wireless network was set up and even when I was right in front of the base station. Besides the static problems, the range is no better than 2.4GHz phones. I've also tried the Motorola MD681; also a cool phone; also the same static problems (actually worse) after short while in use. I thought the Digital Spread Spectrum cordless phones wouldn't have this problem - because they are all digital and don't use any analog frequencies. So disappointing. I still don't have a reliable, static free. My last good one was a Panasonic 2.4GHz phone but that one had short battery life."
2,End of 1 Year Warranty...,"... and my answering machine - out of nowhere - started blinking like crazy, displaying an ""E9"" error. I was told by Panasonic it was an ""internal error"" and needs to be sent for repair. This repair could cost 80+ dollars. I was very disappointed as it wasn't used that frequently and I only had it 1 year and 4 months. It worked well besides that and my handsets were still working but now need a new answering machine for the handsets or I have to buy an entirely new system. :("
2,dont get close to the base,"the phone is great just stay away from the base. when you get near the base people on the other end tell me it sounds like a chopped up cell phone. Living in New York City you are sometimes always near the base. Come on panasonic, for having good features, make the phone able to work near the base, and why was this not tested before release?????"
2,This Phone Has Glitches!,"Beware of the handset interference within a short distance of the base unit. The talking caller ID is absolutley laughable. And the battery life will deteriorate extremely fast. I had to return my unit for repair because the base unit started to produce severe static causing the answering machine playback and calls to be inaudible. They would not give a refund and have to wait until they receive my unit before sending me out a ""refurbished"" unit. Still waiting without a phone for 10 days. I think there are a lot of Amazon shoppers from Panasonic... Check out the class action lawsuit that is pending. http://www.sheller.com/Practice.asp?PracticeID=140"
4,One other feature is missing,"My old Panasonic answering machine had the ability to call a pre-programmed number to notify that there is a message. They call it 'to page', but since the pagers have long gone - it just calls my cell phone and hangs up. That is the feature that I will miss a lot!Also, I don't see it offered at Amazon, but Panasonic also has model KX-TG5243: same as this one but with three handsets. If you are planning to buy this and a handset - 5243 combination is cheaper"
2,Disappointed,"Always said that buying electronic items over the internet is not a smart thing to do. This experience has reinforced my views on that matter. Headset did not work, the wrong plug(toy plug) was sent with charger(phone) and the battery did not work. You would think that you would at least test the unit to make sure that everything worked, that of course did not happen because the wrong plug was sent. Had to use a universal plug that I had for the charger to work. Score was 25% out of 100 of items that worked. The other problem was that there was poor comunication with seller. This expierence was one of the worst that I have had with buying on the internet. This person shound be banned from selling on the amazon site. The only reason I did not send the piece back is because the charger worked and buying the unit was less expensive then buy another one."
3,Operating Manualproblems,I have been wrestling with this gadget for two weeks and all I have is a not too efficient doorstop. The trouble may well dwell in my 80 year oldbrain. However I'm enjoying the challenge and will keep on tinkering.
2,"good phone, but serious problems","I bough the base and 5 additional remote sets from a reputable online company. Within a year, the LCD screens on all but 2 of the phones went blank, and the ""reputable"" company told me I had to deal with Panasonic, not them. As I no longer had the receipt, Panasonic would not fix / replace or even tell me there was any problem with the phones. I have been using them for about 3 years now and gone through 2 full sets of batteries. All the phones do still work, and their range is very good, but literally, 4 of the 6 LCD screen no longer worked, and have not worked for years. I woudl never buy this phone type again, and my suggestion is for others to look elsewhere. All the talk of a lawsuit, however, has produced nothing via google, and all links I have seen about the lawsuit were bogus. It's unfortunate, as it was a VERY expensive system for a home."
2,"Loved the features, hated the sound quality","I bought this unit because of other reviews I had read concerning wireless connections and cordless phones. Well, they were wrong. The extra handset was in the room with our wireless router for our computers. You had to leave the room to get a phone call. There was nothing but static on the phone.The base unit had some problems too with sound. It would screech and whistle about 15-20 seconds into a call, and that was standing right in front of the base.I really did like some of the features like the speaker phone/intercom. All the whistles and bells aren't worth anything if the phone doesn't work. I took this back and got an AT & T E5960. So far we are satisfied with that one."
2,Bad Sound,"I was pretty jazzed up to see this EasyCall solution. It addresses the headphone problems that I've been having working from home. Whenever a phone call would come in, it would always take me a while to answer the call because I had to first pause/stop my music player, then take off my PC headphones, then fumble around to put on my telephone headphones, then answer the call. This setup cuts out all those steps and all I have to do is press a button to answer the call. The only problem is that music coming from the PC sounds like crap, even with the Skype hack. It is flat and tinny. The quality may be high enough for phone calls, though. I'll have to return this item and look for the next solution, unfortunately."
2,Logitech acknowledges a problem with EasyCall keyboards...,"Logitech acknowledges a problem with EasyCall keyboards. Battery life may be only one month or less. Please search Logitech's support site for answer ID #6396 titled ""LX 710 (EasyCall) Keyboard has short battery life"".If you experience this issue, Logitech will NOT replace your unit. Only refunds are available for EasyCall Desktop setups.I've also experienced a problem with the mouse that is included in this package. One of the extra buttons on the mouse are clicked ""by itself"" randomly without me actually hitting it.These problems are a shame, because the EasyCall speakerphone works excellent. I'm not sure why they're not offering the speakerphone as a standalone product."
1,Easy call Wireless keyboard,"Not a very good product. The mouse is okay. The wireless keyboard needs the batteries changed about every 3 or 4 weeks. Contacted Logitech and sent me a new one. The new one did the same thing. I was sent a third one and still no difference. I gave up at that point. They send the same replacement series as the old one. They are supposed to send a different series. I now go out of my way to avoid Logitech products. I consider their products and customer service, very undesirable. Just a piece of junk."
4,great keyboard and mouse all around!,love the material of the keyboard and is very comfortable. the laser mouse is definitely a plus. i would recommend to buy even if yu dont need the easycall function like me. hot keys all work. it works great! and the battery life is great! would recommend to all!
4,"Good, Bad and OK","Good - You will get a Wireless Keyboard and mouse, which works without any issues. You Can use the wireless controller as a speaker phone, mic and call control buttons. So you could use the headset for another computer (if you want to)Bad - Mouse battery dies within 1-2 months. No visual indication of caps lock, num lock etc on keyboard( LEDs)This not a portable version, you cant use the mouse as portable wireless mouse while traveling. Best suited for desktop computers.,logitech, speakerphone, wireless desktop, wireless mouse"
2,Love it and Hate it,"I love the mouse that came with the combo, but I hate the keyboard, not that it isn't comfortable, but rather it has some quirks. I like to play FPS's, which sometimes require multiple key press's, however the keyboard doesn't seem to like this, at least mine. It will do one button press and hold it until you release both keys. I've tried logitech's fix's (reconnection the keyboard to the base) and that fixed it for about a hour, and then it's back to driving me crazy.Other than not being able to use my keyboard to play some games, it's been a good keyboard so far. My only other complaint is the fact that you can't really use it with a kvm switch. I have two computers, and only enough space on the desk for one keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Fortunately my kvm is a older ps/2 connector style, and so I was able to leave the previous keyboard and mouse plugged into it, and use it to switch between computers, but it still requires me to have two keyboard and two mice."
1,Has a life of its own,"While the keyboard and mouse works just fine for me so far, the biggest and most annoying problem with this system is that it messes with my sound settings without asking me. In other words, every time I close and reopen the internet or have to restart the computer, it changes the default settings in the sound control panel to use the speakerphone, rather that the original sound settings. What happens then is sound is cut from my Logitech 2.1 speakers. So every time I have to go into the Control Panel and change the sound settings. I have not been able to come up with one single way to keep this from happening, and of course you have to use the speakerphone for the wireless to work. I am currently shopping for another wireless set up."
4,best for the price,i bought this watch for my mother and she liked it very mutch. i gave the watch 4 stars because of the band quality. it is not real leather and looks like it is going to be outwear very easily. anyway i recommend this watch for this price...
3,Helping to plug the gap in my knowledge of Russian Music.,"This man's orchestration is rather good, and the music is really approachable. Quite distinctive but very of it's time and place! An interesting CD - I strongly recomend it."
5,I love this thing,"This controller works awesome..... At first I got screwed up cause my breath was messing up the readings. I left it alone for a while and let it work, and when I came back the levels were just about where I set them, 1500ppm.One thing that takes some time to dial in was the flow rate on the co2. Start with ur flow rate very low and see how quickly the levels increase in your room, as well as the overshoot histeresis. If you are flying by your set point by more than 50ppm, you're flow rate is too high. You don't want to waste it, so take the time to adjust it.also, make sure u have good air flow around the controller, its very important. I mounted a pc fan directly under vents blowing up through the unit. This way it has a good air sample to work with.Calibrate the unit outside, it works much better....just run an extension cord outside and leave it alone, if u stand near it, u will screw it up.....takes about 20 minutes.Good luck!"
4,A good book,This book has the minimun to know about molecular genetics of bacteria (I am studing this subject). The illustrations are clear and very good.I can very easily see this book being used to supplement lectures in an introductory course on biotecnology. I thoroughly recommend it.
4,Good book for the proper reader.,"I got a lot out of this book: not mastery of the subject, but the kind of feel for genetics you cannot get from a popular book on the subject. I occasionally had to skip material, but I rarely got frustrated. It is well written, and reasonably short. Its production values are somewhat lacking for the price: self references are to chapters, not chapter sections, and the diagrams are often amateurish, although sometimes very helpful. My background: very minimal organic chemistry (but the terms covalent bond and hydrogen bond weren't unknown to me), a popular science book on genetics under my belt, not very extensive knowledge of biology. A book such as ""Dictionary of Modern Biology"" by Norah Rudin is a definite help, and that book is very inexpensive."
3,So so,"This book covers a good amount, but I'm much happier with Snyder's bacterial genetics book. This one isn't as through, nor as enjoyable to read."
1,Not happy!!!,I bought this asparagus steamer a couple of years ago and was able to use it only a few times because the basket and the bottom of the steamer rusted right away. I have several stainless steel pots and none of them rusted...they are not supposed to. I was definitely not happy with the product!
1,Quality Comes Up Short!,"Although the Steamer was advertised as Stainless Steel. I found out after the second use that the basket, that holds the food is not. It showed rust at several of the soldered points. This was very disapointing. So now, I just have an extra pot."
2,How To Sell Screendumps to Anybody,"Do buy this book if you've never heard of XML and you don't really want to know what it is or what it does.Don't buy this book if you want to know how repeating sections differ from repeating tables, or if you want to understand all the data validation options.Although this book does offer some simplified explanations of what Infopath does, it is as light on useful examples as it is heavy on screendumps. Simply repeating what's displayed on the screen is not terribly enlightening, and it's even worse when the text and the screendumps are continually 2 or 3 pages apart.Shocking spelling and simple grammatical errors detract from the little genuinely useful information presented, and make the whole book's pace seem rushed and incomplete.If you don't really like Microsoft, but you have to learn Infopath, find another book!"
2,"LOOKS NOTHING LIKE PICTURE, but smells nice.","Sometimes, when you purchase an item online, you can expect it to look a little different when you see it in person....But this candle looked nothing like the pic. Just wax poured into a plain glass. It does smell nice, but for the price I feel angry. I bought it for the look as well as the scent."
5,they are both very good movies,I loved this movie from the first time I saw it actually I love them both so I was happy to buy the both A Grandpa for Christmas and The Christmas Card
5,Excellent Christmas Movies!,"The Christmas Card is one of my lifetime favorite Christmas movies, endearing in its simplicity, touching in its heartfelt warmth, one I can enjoy with my kids and grandkids.A Grandpa for Christmas is also an excellent movie, which I got for my wife, also one to be watched and enjoyed with the kids and grandkids."
2,Don't bother.,"I'm probably going to make a lot of people mad, especially after reading some of the reviews, but this book was just dumb. Catherine Anderson is either really good or really bad and this book was just a little too much. From beginning to end, it was just silly. She has written books much better than this."
3,"Great plot, poor conversation!","I gound baby love is a great read. It is just a little dissapointing that Ms Anderson deliver a ""too funny"" conversation between the two subjects. I reckogn if i were put in Maggie situation, i would not too appreciate a person who talked me into a joke and still shine as a charming prince. And I don't believe Rafe could be so easily fall head over heals in love with a woman who apperently rejected and hurted him from the very beginning and still try to keep nonchallant appearance by delevering joke around her. Somehow i like the plot, but i don't think the whole situation are spoken with eagerness... it tends to be boring somewhere between pages (maybe the story doesn't ring to be real-er?)."
5,I Loved It So Much!!,"I really enjoyed this book, We all dream of a Rafe someone that is rich and with a warm heart, as for Maggie her and her son were so luck to have found him. It is such a beauiful story about love the kind you always hope to find I know I have found mine. I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did Happy Reading"
5,WAY TO GO!!!,As a single mother this book gave me that hope that sometimes you just need to hang on to. and as in her tradition - she introduced you to Ryan just enough to need to meet him. If you plan on reading this book you MUST get the rest. everyone is just as good as its predecesor. You think they can't get any better - and yet they do. I recommend this one first - then Ryan and Bethany - and then you get sucked into the Coulters.
2,"Unlikely, unbelievable, and difficult","This started out as a promising read, very British, very gritty, but in the end,my suspension of disbelief got the better of me. Policeman turned hit man turned psycho loony killer on the run and busting a criminal ring all at the same time. A love interest that turns into a baddy and then turns out to be innocent kind of, all stretched the credibility gap. Every second paragraph lighting a cigarette also became a bit wearing. Not sure if it was an attempted nod to noir, but it just got annoying.I won't be reading the followups."
2,"Highly Derivative, Not the Pure Stuff","[Weak] attempt to recast Leary's ""Flashbacks"" in Vonnegutian style. Trite, self-inflating and silly. Also lots of typos."
5,"Great Product, but error in description!","The Believing in Dreams wall border is an adorable accent to your child's room and complements the Believing in Dreams bedding set and other room decor. Would recommend for either boy's or girl's room.However, there was an error in the description that I wanted to note. The border should measure FIFTEEN FEET across, not inches!Another tidbit of information: This nursery theme is by Eddie Bauer and was formally known by the title My Little Star, before they changed it to Believing in Dreams."
1,cholestral results,"My wife and I are currently taking this medication, or whatever it is classified as, for about 6 weeks, and have not had the time to get the results on our cholestrsl findings, but want to be able to buy more later. When we do get the results,and if they are good for us. Can we buy this product from you ??"
4,Mature work from an old bluegrass pro,"Sweet, understated performances by a competent, assured oldtimer. These tracks, mostly recorded in the late 1970s, have a lovely informality to them. Relaxed, slow-paced, these lilting heart songs pretty much forego the drag-racing instrumental machismo of modern bluegrass, in favor of heartfelt, lingering sentiment braced by melodic simplicity and calm clarity of purpose. The CD reissue also includes about a half dozen newer tracks, recorded in 1987 and '89 with much the same band, anchored by Eanes and lead guitarist Ray Cline... The earlier sessions also include Hershel Sizemore and Rickie Simpkins, and a host of lesser-known pickers. This disc won't catch your stereo on fire, but it's still pretty sweet."
2,Wimpy bluegrass,"I had the privilege of seeing Jim Eanes at the Roanoke festival in '65 (I guess). This album, however, is mellifluous, smooth, and rather wimpy, IMHO. His country stuff is much better, again, IMO. However, his song, ""Baby Blue Eyes"", is done well on this album.Finally, note that the thumbnail of the album cover on the Amazon site (at least, as of 20sep99) depicts a Bach trumpet gala, not this album!"
4,Awesome book,"Awesome book; the pictures are fabulous. You can tell some of the pictures are a bit dated, but the in-the-womb pictures are still beyond compare to what else is out there. I only wish there were more pictures, like on a weekly basis- but I suppose what was in the book was already hard enough to come by.I definitely recommend this book!"
5,A must read for every human being!,"I baught this book when we started trying to have a baby. Now that we are expecting I love to look at the photos of unborn babies and see how my baby is developing. This is such an amazing book. I havent been able to find this information or photos like these anywere else. It is so well written and is perfect to help explain to children about life, especially if they are expecting a sibling to be born. I cant speak highly enough of this book. But it is more than well worth the read."
1,This book was a fraud.,This book is a fraud. I have three other copies of this book and it is a fraud. Had to go find another one from Barnes and Noble to give as my gift.
4,Awesome book,"When i received the book it was in awesome condition no pages were missing and no markings, plus I bought it used. A friend recommended me this book saying it was one of the best baby books any mother could read. She was right besides from all the great pictures it's a great book to read I read the whole book in an hour I couldn't put it down."
5,Thaks,Condition of the book was exactly as described and arrived within a couple of days. Thanks again 5/09
5,Learning tool from 5 years old to 25,"I can remember seeing some of the pictures in the book when I was 4 or 5 years old. My mom had a copy around when I was a little girl. She used it to teach me about where babies come from, and I think it was an awesome learning tool. I also remember being in 6th or 7th grade and looking to it again because of the photography itself. How often do you get to see a human fetus?I've read reviews of this ""A Child is Born"" that said it was too graphic; I don't think so. If it was too graphic, I would be scarred for life, and not buying a book to have around for when I decided to have children. Looking back, it was nice to have this book on the family bookshelf; when I was in junior high, and emarrased to ask anybody anything about sex, I looked to this book for my answers. When I decide to have children, I'm going to add it to my personal collection as well."
3,"Ok CD, But....","This is an ok CD but they cut one song (My favorite song) by like 2 minutes. The Song ""alone"" Which is i think a little over 6 minutes is now a little over 4 minutes. Other then that its a good CD. All the other songs on it are good. I just wish they didnt cut ""Alone"" the way they did."
3,"Nice intro, Recent stuff Bad","I won't go beyond Amorphis' third album, Elegy. It was their fluffy masterpiece, but they lost their juice when they resorted instead to soundscapes from bad 80's metal music, which was partly due to the addition of woeful singer, Pasi, who sings with a monotonous harmony. Ironic enough, he sings on Elegy, only in bites, which doesn't really effect the album. What made Amorphis great in their early days was that their music, which always tried be progressive, was focused and they tried to manifest that their death metal roots. Compared to the more recent stuff, Amorphis had a sort of simplicity to them, both lyrically and musically. Drowned Maid, is a testament to that philosophy--even, Tomi's growls blend seamlessly into the guitars, and it doesn't sound bloated. Alone, on the other hand, is the type of sound that drew away a lot of people with Tuonela--Kenny G saxaphones and bad singing."
4,Get Kress,"Kress writes terse, razor-sharp prose. Each word count and each word was a joy to read.I have never balked reading troublesome stories, tales of travesty, violence, dysfunction, as long as -- don't laugh -- it is written with a smile.I was so delighted with this book that it was impossible to not also imagine the author's pleased smile as he wrote it.If you want trite formula, with plotline you can see coming down the pike, forget Kress.If you're intelligent, want an absorbing and stimulating tale, you can't miss.Get Kress."
4,Deadly Desire,"This was a good read. It kept you guessing throughout the whole book as to ""who done it"" and what was going to happen next."
4,Great investment,I normally use plastic bags for my gym shoes and they tear a lot. This helps me carry my gym shoes around without looking like a hobo. :)
5,Where to get the book these days.,"To date, would-be readers of this book likely sought online, soon finding what once cost $30 now sold in upwards of $250. Now I am not prepared to pay any such price. I came by a loan through ILS, and while finding it a great book, I put away any notions of stealing. The dearth has frustrated my ambitions for some time. But I let not such roadblocks linger long. Let us say that I used 'common sense' and went to the book's 'source'. Apparently, OUP has resold him the rights to his book, and he has made it available and affordable once more. Through a lady of his acquaintance I am getting a new copy for $25. What's more, the 'flaws' other readers have complained about are largely corrected by the author himself. You are picqued now, but, to counter solicitors, the lady's email will be sconced in a code. (...)"
4,reads like a novel,From a lover of books to lovers of books...it speaks to the heart and tickles wonderful memories. Pennac must be a lovely person; after this you will want to have dinner with him! Or ask him to babysit your children.
1,will not fit all trilogys,"this part only fits the base model trilogy,not all trilogys are milled alike,i have a milled area area causing the angle of the rod to be misaligned causing it not to actuate"
3,Good book,"A former classmate of mine in the seminary helped research and write this book, so I bought it to check out the work he did. Nicely done. Fun read, and easy to navigate, as are most of these 'for Dummies' books (duh). Great fo those who want to know all they can on one of the greatest Popes ever to lead the Catholic Church and an insight into the era in which he lead. Nice tidbits on his life, passions, and ultimately his love for God which inspired everything he did."
2,awful,"Perhaps I set my expecations too high, being that Peter was from DCD, but it was simply terrible. The music was a feined attempt at what the spirit of DCD was, but didn't even come close. I regret risking money on this album, and will definitely be getting rid of it as quickly as possible."
4,pleasant surprise,"On first listening to this album, I had no idea Ulrich was a member of Dead Can Dance, though I can now hear the influences. This is a lighter, mellower, more New Age-y type sound, especially in the vocals. The musicianship, the world music influences, and the provocative lyrics keep it soaring above such elevator-Muzak fodder as John Tesh, Yanni, and the more recent incarnations of Tangerine Dream. The Projekt label puts out one quality release after another, and this one is no exception."
4,Makes for a good read for serious fans,"""Enfant Terrible!: Jerry Lewis in American Film"" is a worthy book for those serious fans of Jerry Lewis. A good collection of essays, it is most beneficial with Shawn Levy's update from his detailed, very readable biography of Lewis' life (a bio that Lewis apparently did not care for, as Levy notes). Also worthy is the detailed analysis of Lewis' ""The Jazz Singer"" TV special, of which I heard little about (other than in Levy's book) before purchasing this. Other films are given serious thought - ""Arizona Dream,"" ""The Geisha Boy,"" ""The Stooge,"" and ""The Disorderly Orderly."" What's missing is a detailed list of all of Lewis' films (which, of course, would have added another 10 pages to the volume). But I have referred back to it on occasion and it is a critical, even-keeled look at a major comedian/actor of the 20th century."
5,Gon is back!,"Gon the irrepressible little orange dinosaur returns for another adventure. This time Gon teams up with a coyote, a prarie dog, a bat, and an ant. They do battle with a giant spider, and end up on the other side of the world. Dont be thrown off by the fact that this book has no words or sounds, it is not to be missed! Whether you're a Manga fan, an Art connaissuer, or just want a good story, This book is for you!"
2,Dead before dusk,"After being upset that this wouldnt be released around october like all the other books, I waited until january and got the book when i first spotted it... And i just dont think i can read any more of her vampire series... They just get worse as each one comes out... I am a big fan of shannon drake aka heather graham but her books have been lacking lately... This latest book just had nothing that i could sink my teeth into... The story line was weak and the characters didnt grip my heart like past books... Maybe the next one will be better but i wont be rushing out to buy it..."
3,"Not bad, but somewhat predictable...","I got this book because I had enjoyed other books by this author but unfortunately, it wasn't the best of the few I've read. It wasn't exactly what I expected but overall was entertaining and kept me somewhat in suspense. Towards the end, it became predicatable what was happening and who was who. This book was rather slow in the beginning and too fast in the end. It seems like we built up to this great battle and it only lasted a few pages. But I won't give up on this author just yet."
2,Lacks a good story line.,"After looking forward to Shannon Drake's newest novel, I was very disappointed. The story isn't well told and the story line is weak. To make up for this Drake continually writes about sexual dreams and fantasies of her characters.Drake's first 3 novels on vampires were 5 star books. These are: ""Beneath a Blood Red Moon"", ""When Darkness Falls"" and ""Deep Midnight"".I wish she would go back to her historical novels. I really love her as a author but I believe she is running out of vampire stories."
1,Bootleg of BYU Soundtrack - DO NOT BUY!,"This is, unfortunately, another Membran bootleg of a legitimately licensed and produced soundtrack. In this case, the soundtrack to SHE was produced by BYU/CR Studios and released through Screen Archives Entertainment. Membran even lifted the cover art (as they always do). Please do not patronize these thieves. Hopefully some day Amazon will stop listing their unauthorized products. The review process necessitates giving at least one star. This album deserves 0. The BYU original is a ***** classic."
5,Best band in the country right now,"Seven Color Sky is a little known band from Pittsburgh, but their music and Scott Bedillion's lyrics are mesmerizing - there's no doubt in my mind they're the best band around. Their first effort, Secrets About the Stars, was fun and nostalgic (for those of us who love 80s British alternative music), but this EP is a breakthrough. With the help of producer John Ashton (guitarist for the Psychedelic Furs), Seven Color Sky has captured something special - that moment when lyrics and music and ambience coalesce into something greater than the parts. ""Better Looking"" is the best song I've heard in years, the best since another little-known (in the States, at least) but unbelievable band, Gene, stopped putting out heart-stopping songs. And the second song, ""Next Day"", is gripping in its own right. For god's sake, BUY THIS RECORD!"
1,Jesus Christ never read Ayn Rand,"I bought this book with the idea that it would reveal some insights into the foundation of the christian faith. What shaped the teachings and how they differ from the modern day teachings of christianity.I was very disappointed With this book. It is on the whole garbage. The author reverts to calling Jesus [simpleminded]simply because the teachings found in todays gospels or what pass for the teachings of this figure called ""Jesus"" don't agree with what he believes to be the all encompassing truth of the universe. In particular the teachings of our lord and savior Ayn Rand.As a former christian I must say that if the christian gospels (who ever wrote them), don't correlate with the teachings of Ayn Rand then that in and of it's self does not prove them to be false! It also does not mean anyone who disbelieves the Almighty(Ayn Rand) is [simpleminded]"
1,This book is far far away from reality,"This book is based on misconception about Christianity and nothing to do with Christian faith. If anybody wants to read reality about Christianity they should read the Bible. And also please read my book ""Is Jesus God?""ISBN: 0759628092, Author: Sherly IsaacThanksSherly Isaac"
3,I AM THE AUTHOR - NEWS!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got an email from someone with an @700club.com email address who offered me $100,000 for the full ownership rights to my book ""Christianity Exposed""I asked him what would he do with the book. He refused to say.I bet they want the book taken off the market!"
1,Serious readers stay away.,"I bought this book (along with another title by the same author) looking for insight into the history behind christianity. This book, along with the author's other material, consists of nothing but the inane writings of a clueless, ignorant man. I expected a serious study on the subject, and was let down. I wish I had researched the author first, but I guess hindsight is 20/20. Also, if you have read any of his books, you will also notice that a good many of the 5 star reviews here were written by him. His style is easily recognized. Tulbure, you're not fooling anyone."
1,S.Tulbure is a clown.,"S.Tulbure, has three webpages. One of these pages, is dedicated to an ""age-old secret organisation"" called the ""illuminati"", of which mr. Tulbure is a ""Grandmaster"". On the forum of this page, Tulbure writes articles coaching people to feed sperm to babies, and women to use sperm for cosmetic purposes.Tulbure, who claims to have a doctorate to his name, wouldn't win a spelling competition, and basic grammer is also not his strongest point.Apart from the sexually warped articles, dr Tulbure tends to react to post disagreeing with his views, by using four letter words.The man is very ""original"" in his views. (See sperm above) But I have as yet to see one logical argument backing them up."
1,No Star,Christianity Exposed exposed more the author(?) then christianity. S. Tulbure is a very bad example for representing atheism. Reading his books you become a hater of atheism not christianity.
1,oh please!,"Another book filled with ignorant blather from a man who is ignorant of history, theology and biblical research. His [weak] arguments will convince those who want to be convinced but none else. his claims that Paul originated christianity instead of Christ were so thoroughly refuted in the 1920's by J. Gresham Machen that only the most ignorant person could possibly still put them forward as serious arguments. Go read ""The Origin of Paul's Religion"" by Machen. That is if your ... brain can handle a book with serious scholarship behind it. ..."
1,"sad, very sad","This book had a good deal of potential, but fails completely. Written by someone that seems to be ""preaching to the choir"" rather than addressing issues honestly and sincerely. If you already dont like religion, this book will make you like it even less; if you are religious, dont worry this book will cause no doubts. It seems that the author has some deep personal reason for his dislike of religion, but what it is remains hidden."
2,Yawn,Although very interesting the book was a tad bit boring and too long. The author could have made his point in a shorter version of this book. If you're looking for a book showing contradictions in the Bible this book is filled with them. This book basically shows all the contradictions the Old and New Testament has and mistranslations mixed with whole lot of lies used to control the public.Interesting but a better book I read was The Christ Conspiracy: The Greateest story ever sold.
1,I Wish This Book Were Better,"I read this book hoping to gain insight and collect ammunition to use against the many Chrisitians I run into every day. All I got was an overpriced crock of dung. The book is poorly written and the author is obviously bi-polar and in need of medication before he tries to write another book. I'm really serious. If you are a non-christian or an atheist looking for supporting documentation, go to another author. This one has nothing to offer."
1,"Absolutely silly, beyond presumptuous","This is the sort of rubbish that gives theological debate a bad name. There is no intellectualism here. What there is, is a good deal of whiny, uneducated yelling.My own grounding in the politics and histories of various religions is extensive. My personal beliefs aside, I enjoy challenging material. But this is so poorly written, so rude (always a sure sign of insecurity), so rife with childish speculation based on NO scholarship AT ALL...to whom do I write to get my money back?"
1,This Will Likely Be The Last Review Of This Book,"First, yes, I read it. It was unimaginative and written from the perspective of a man who made many presumptions about the Bible prior to reading it. Then he set out to prove his presumptions. Now let me make this review unique by telling you something very important about the book and the author. First, there will be no more books by this author. Solomon Tulbure WAS a very troubled man mentally. He WAS indeed diagnosed with schizophrenia. In other books written by him he claimed to use a Ouija board to contact higher powers who made him the Grand Master of the Illuminati. I am not making any of this up. It is true. I knew him personally and all of this is verifiable. Also, Solomon Tulbure is deceased. He committed suicide in Knoxville, KY almost 2 years ago. That too is verifiable. The obituaries are online. His writings are the scribblings of a man with many inner demons."
3,It's a Matter of Taste,"Glancing through the table of contents, I was fascinated with Francesca Dipaolo highly creative and unique recipes (e.g., carrot-cream cheese muffins, chive and black pepper cornmeal muffins, sour cream and peach muffins). Her simple technique of separating dry and wet ingredients, while not new, was well explained and demonstrated throughout each recipe. Given the host of interesting recipes in this book and the author's fool-proof technique, I had imagined myself whipping up unparalleled muffins that would bring people to their knees. I was, however, completely disappointed with the final product. I tried about 20 recipes in the book, all with the same sad end. Each recipe yielded muffins with a heavy and mealy consistency. This is probably Dipaolo's muffin preference (heavy and hearty versus light and fluffy) and the recipes have been constructed around her taste. This is not the recipe book for those with a taste for fat and fluffy quick breads."
2,Is this even Scholarship?,"I respect what Professor Marable is trying to say in his book, however, it isn't articulated well enough. What stands out in my mind is that (especially with regard to the Malcolm X chapter) the 'scholarly pursuit' found within is more deductive and assuming than anything. Aside from that, to look at the sources in the bibliography, is like wading through a mire and it makes clarifying his research more difficult (there aren't even proper footnotes). This could have been better. But it's worth reading."
4,"Useful product, but . . . .",The boxed unit arrived quickly from Amazon's supplier. It was not immediately unpacked because it was not yet needed. When unpacked it turned out that a key component was missing. I attempted to contact the company by phone and there was no answer. The unit was not overpacked when it was shipped; just a label stuck on the store display box. Apparently it came open during shipping and this key part was lost. My BAD for not opening and checking it at once. The product requires that the toilet seat mounting be taken apart for the frame to be mounted.
2,Very wiggly,I used this post knee replacrment surgery and found the arms very woly. Not a good feeling after major surgery
4,A must for those who love bohemian music,"Festive Symphony is an underrated work by Smetana. People who love ""Ma Vlast"" or symphonies of Dvorak should try this. The mainstream labels might provide you with better sound, they can not give you the choice to buy CD containing music hardly heard like this."
5,Terrific Story!!,"A newly retired, single man in his mid 50's meets a very cute, young gay man in the local dog park. After his sister gives the main character a puppie, he has not choice but to take his new dog for walks. As the two in the park get to know each other, he eventually discovers that he might be gay, and even more confusing for him, is his realizeation that he might be falling in love with the young man. Great story!!"
4,Delightful,"Not the best performances, and there were a couple of scenes that caused me to say ""huh?"", but I have to admit that days later I was still touched by this little movie. I found myself caring for the main couple more than I thought I would."
2,Not Very Good,"I'm a huge fan of indie gay films. There are some really great ones out there...this one was not one of them. With Wendie Malick in the credits, I thought this film couldn't miss. She was flawless. The rest of the cast was stiff; their characters and dialogue weren't even close to believable.The writing was poor and the editing was choppy at times.For a $3.99 rental on Amazon Video on Demand...not bad...I wouldn't spend more than that."
4,Amusing and worth a passing read,"unlike most self-help books this came across as something anyone could have written based on their real expiriences. It was like a sympathetic voice to those who feel lost. it does not demand you change the way you think or try to feel better. rather accepts lifes uncertain and sometimes unhappy moments. It says this is real and it's ok.this book takes a humourous and sometimes insightful look at the depressing circumstances we all face from time to time. it refers to a good number of great thinkers and if you don't know where to start with them it may be of some use. i would not call it depressing, it seems to take such a light-hearted attitude towards its material that i doubt it was intended for any serious reflections.i enjoyed reading it and i would definately recommend it to anyone who feels real life can be a let down and would like to laugh about it."
1,Don't be lazy and don't buy this book!,"Do yourself a favor and read the original writings by the authors quoted and interpreted by Boyd throughout ""Afflictions"". If you have done any reading of the original texts, you will see that he clearly skews their words and that his interpretations are frivilous and ridiculous. Too negative to be worth a read! For the real treasure dig into the classics which he is profitting upon."
1,too bad to pass on,"This has to be the worst book I have bought or opened, so much so that i have decided to write my first book review after purchasing many books from amazon.I found this book so uninspiring and poor that I couldn't think of anyone who I could give it to and they would even semi enjoy. I ended up binning this book as it was too bad to even put on my bookshelf.The book is meant to be inspiring, thought provoking ""manifesto"" where it is really a poorly written , negative, unintelligent peace of incoherant nonsense. Spend your time and money on anything else but this book and it will be better spent."
4,Warmth,"That's the word I think of most when I listen to this recording; warmth. Anne Sofie von Otter gives us a wonderful Christmas surprise with this album. I have never been an opera fan, and had never before heard of Anne Sofie until I'd heard this recording. Once I'd listened to koppangen, however, I was sold on her voice and unique approach to Christmas. Track 5 (""Oh Sweet little Jesus"" in English) has a rich, warm string accompaniment that is truly moving to hear. I had to search everywhere to find this gem. Enjoy"
5,It Just Gets Better and Better,"The ""problem"" with this album is that the first song, ""Koppangen,"" is so stunning that it blows everything else out of the water. Your ears have been dazzled, which makes the rest of the songs seem like dross in comparison. Also, the songs are each very different, one from the other, different in arrangement and different in mood. I found this a bit jarring at first -- it seemed to lack a cohesive sound -- but in time, I came to appreciate each song in its own right. And, to state the obvious, this IS Anne Sofie Von Otter. I recommend that you just take your time and listen to ""Koppangen"" over and over until it becomes familiar. Then give a fresh ear to the other songs, which reveal themselves more slowly. One of my favorites is the exquisite ""Sweet was the Song."" The texture of her voice against the texture of the lute elevates this simple melody to a near-religious experience. Turn up the volume on this track and float in its slow, stark beauty."
4,Great footage of Ian,"I would fully recommend this DVD to Ian Hunter fans. The technical quality of the DVD is excellent and so is the performance of Hunter and the band. A wide range of material is covered here, and some of the songs are quite new. Some of the highlights for me include ""Twisted Steel"", a song Hunter wrote in response to September 11th, ""I wish I was your mother"", and ""Irene Wilde"". The DVD also includes an interview with Hunter and 3 bonus tracks, one of which is ""Roll away the Stone"", another Mott favorite of mine. It's nice to see this man is still growing and progressing as an artist."
1,WHAT??,"This is one of the worst sexual help books I've read. She doesn't even address ISD (inhibitied Sexual Desire) which is a common problem among women my age (25-30), instead she talks about some group therapy nonsense and psuedo-animal roles via sexual archtypes. YAWN. This book educates no one. It seems like this doctor helped out some friends of hers through a rough patch and now she considers herself an expert. Kudos to the promotion people for the design and hype of the book...please DO NOT JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER!"
1,Not Even Sexy,"I thought from the cover that this book would be about sex, or at least interesting. But it's a real yawn. Lots of pseudo-psychobabble that doesn't make much sense. If you're looking for something good about sex, you'd be far better off with anything by Lonnie Barbach, or (if you're into psychobabble, Dr. Judy Kuriansky). This book is a joke."
1,DOPEY!,"This is one of those dopey ""self-help"" books that asks you to decide what type of ""animal"" you are (bee, otter, etc.) and then apply this hot new knowledge to your sex life. Yikes! It makes you wonder how stupid American publishers think the reading public is. Anyway, this moronic, simple-minded book is destined for oblivion. Save your twenty bucks. Buy a couple pizzas instead."
3,Wrong title,"I like this book a lot, but it isn't really what I was looking for exactly. I was looking for a 255 level college course book and got a 104 level college course book. The book seems to never really talk about liars, lovers or heroes, but it does catch me up on lots of unknown and interesting brain studies and psychological studies that seem to show a small window into the brain as an oddly wired organ.The author should delete the first introductory chapter as fluff and shallowness, but then they probably didn't have a say in the name of the book. The publish must have picked it to try and sell it with the bright yellow cover ? Anyway, the nuggets of info are pretty good and some of the witty sentences are great. Some not so great, but not too bad for two PHDs trying to write.*smileHopefully their next brain book will be more edible and chewy and harder to read. I like my brain to work hard ok ! *grin"
4,Happy to meet the challenge...,"I cheated. I looked in the back of the book for the answers so I could understand the programmer's mind behind the solution. I'm getting so much out of this book! Now, I'll think of a problem I need to solve, and because I took the time to learn some fundementals, I can piece together solutions in my head, which test positive when coded and loaded. A very satisfying experience all around. Reverse engineer is the way to learn!May the parse be with you!"
4,Learning PHP is a good start,"Good starting book if you don't know anything about PHP, also easy to review if you know how to program in other languages."
2,Way too simplistic,"I got this book because I figured it would be a good introduction to PHP, but it was not. I have experience programming applications (in java and C), but not for the web and was curious about php.It feels that after reading the entire book, I hardly know about php 5. If all you want to know is how to make basic forms or how to interact with a database in a basic way then this book may be for you, but if you want to know the ins and outs of php this book is horrible.I definitely think this book is pretty much useless for experienced programmers, but I would also be inclined to believe that its not good for beginners either. Oh well, I'm off to shop for a new book on php!"
4,I liked...,Well written and organized. One thing I should mention is that there is a lot of hand holding as the book is really made for beginners.
3,Learning PHP 5 is not about PHP 5,"Basic book on php. Not very good although well written. Cheats on some tasks (like SQL) by relying on PEAR etc. Nothing about object oriented php nor specifics on PHP 5.0 As such, the title is a rip off. Typical O'Reilly fluff."
1,Good but examples are riddle with simple mistakes,"I was hoping this book with explain the fine points in PHP 5 but NO! Starting on the 7th example (page 10), the author made two mistakes in his example: This is no such variable as $dbq and q->numrows is suppose to be q->numrows(). And there's more. I expected more from an O'reily author but....For a beginning book, this book assumes you understand PEAR, have it installed and working. This is your basic college textbook: lots of theories -- no application. It looks like some college professor wrote it.This book is a good starting point for the beginning PHP programmers but it it's not useful in trying to apply PHP to anything. Bottomline: I stopped after chapter one."
1,Buggy Examples,"Why do I have to give this even 1 star? The early examples in the book didn't work, so I put it down and never went back to it."
3,some good tricks,"If you're in a Windows shop, save yourself a lot of pain: download EasyPHP (mentioned on p. 261). Then substitute a version 5.2 php for C:\EasyPHP\php (which is version 4.3) . HINT: EasyPHP uses the php.ini in the conf-files dir, not the one in the php."
1,"Errors, and more errors.....drowning in unworkable examples.","This book has more errors in it that you could imagine.I started the book, started typing out the examples...and they would not work. Then I discovered that there was an errata page, and I was stunned to see the number of errors that this book contains.Computer programming books that aim to teach novices should contain very few errors, if any at all. A novice is no position to know whether it is he or she that is making a mistake, the author, the software, his operating system, etc.I cannot believe the number or errors in this book. After looking at the errata page, I realized I had no time for this nonsense. Boy, what a waste of money.The book is in the trash...a useless, and expensive, wad of paper."
3,"Light, very light, very introductory","I believe the book's title 'PHP 5' is misleading - This is a very basic book about PHP and some things some people do with it. IMHO it is for the absolute novice, the beginning programmer. The book doesn't even touch on PHP's object oriented design or the new features introduced in v. 5. I was disappointed after reading 'Beginning PHP4' by Wrox which was lightyears better. This book lacks any kind of depth. I used it for light bedtime reading but it virtually answered non of the questions I had.That being said, it is well written, easily digestible, nicely structured and aesthetically appealing. It just wasn't a book about learning PHP 5 - it was a book about the general use of PHP."
2,No liner notes,"I purchased a number of albums by Thai ensemble Fong Naam.These recording are historically important as the band has not only recorded traditional material but they have also systematically attempted to change aspects of Thai composition.The albums are also important because of the incredibly thorough and detailed explanation of the music by founding member Bruce Gaston.However. The Naxos CDs that I was sent did not contain liner notes.THAILAND Fong Naam, Vol. 1: The Piphat EnsembleThe CDs had the original 'Marco Polo' cover but were clearly reissued without these valuable note.I warn buyers against purchasing Naxos reissues before checking.I already had the sound files so my purchase was based on the expectation that I would receive the liner note.Sadly I have just spent more than a $100 dollars on these albums and the information that I most wanted was missing."
2,the little book of ketamine,"Itz a pretty basic intro into the topic. I was looking for moredepth though ,but itz a start and I didnt really see enything else out there on this topic....."
4,Actual account that seems like fiction,"Discovery and Conuest of Mexico by Bernal Diaz Del Castilo is a tremendous first hand account of one of histories most amazing achievements. Although the ethnocentricity of the Spainard is patently obvious in most of his descriptions, the story of 500 soldiers of fortune conquering an empire of millions in a newly discovered land is easily able to grab the reader's interest. Written in the late 1500's the language is archaic and romanticized,but this serves to make it a book that can appeal to the ordinary reader as well as be a historical source to the academic. It's not for everyone, but anyone with an interest in history and a love of tales of adventure will enjoy it."
5,So Amazing it seems like a Fairytale,"This book is gripping and easy to read. Most young adults wish they could go on a great adventure and Bernal Diaz (19 or 20 when he started this story) was no different. Of all the true, historically accurate autobiographies I have read, this book is the best hands down. Whether it is fighting against thousands of natives and receiving 7 arrow wounds in one battle or fighting alongside the natives to defeat Montezuma, this book is what most fantasy novels can only attempt. Bernal does have a small thesis: Cortez should not get all the glory but history should share it with the other conquistadors who did as much or more of the actual fighting and converting. Highly recommended."
2,Very disappointing,If you're looking for an objective insight into goldman sachs then i'm afraid this book will disappoint you. It seems from the start that she is in awe of the establishment and her writing only serves to espouse her feelings. I consider it more of 'puppetry'. This bank is definately a powerhouse in the industry but i would wait until a more transparent book is published.(i'm inclined to think her pension is linked to this in some way or the other)
3,one-sided,"While this book provides a nice historical perspective on Goldman, it is one sided. Traders or bankers, who's bigger? What about the rest of the firm, who work their pants off and get the crumbs? Supposedly people are the greatest asset of Goldman, but Hank Paulsen said a couple of years ago that 20% of the people are doing 80% of the work. I'd say 20% of the people earn 80% of the money (or more like 95%). While GS is a good company, it is not the only one on the street and it definitely does not have ""the best and the brightest"" folks out there - they aren't building spacecraft, just making money..."
2,A little disapointing...,"It reads a bit like it was written by the company's PR department. Despite all of her emphasis on ""culture"" at the firm, after reading the book I have no idea what it is. She fails to put a human face on the company. Besides making a lot of money, what is the culture there? I would have liked a lot more personal detail about the employees, what it's really like to work at GS.Moves pretty fast. Ends too soon. She needs to do an update, because this book cuts off at the end of last year, when GS had cancelled their IPO."
3,"nice inside story, ok general read","Not the most breathtaking read, but it suffices in telling a story. I never knew the details of the Goldman Sachs mystique and wanted to know what made their story different than the other ibanks. Now I have a good sense. Definitely recommended to those interested in this realm of business and those who want to get a good feel for the ideals of the company. Most definitely the second half of the book was a bore. And the cliffhanger at the end! I really don't like those unresolved endings..."
5,Another Great Book,"This is a great book too, just like the one on Sandy Weill's ascent. The book shows why Goldman is great... and bad. Sometimes it glorifies GS too much (yawn at the richest and most powerful people in America allusions) but is certainly an interesting read.I give it two thumbs up!"
1,This book stinks!,You'd rather read the Pope on the History of the Catholic Church: equally objective and entertaining.
3,"Good, but could be better","The book was decent, although it could have provided more detail at times. I expected much more informatin on the early years."
5,Excellent Overview,"The author does a great job in making this inside-view of Goldman Sachs interesting. It's meticulously researched and peppered with fascinating stories. I don't know the first thing about business or investment banks, but I found this thoroughly readable and utterly enjoyable. I don't normally read business books, but this is one I am recommending to everyone."
2,Not so great,"I was dissapointed with this DVD. I got it because I have another work out video by Michelle which I love and it is my all-time favorite, I thought this one would be as good, but it is not. The pilates section is too short and it does not have enough sets, I have to pause it in order to get more repetitions in and actually get a work out. Just like another reviewer said, it is also hard to do the work out and view the dvd at the same time, I guess it'll take a few times to memorize the move and then you can do it without watching. I didn't care for the yoga, I don't feel anything, not even stretching my muscles. The ballet is ok, but I've never done any dancing of any sort, so I wouldn't know if it's good or not, and it's a bit challenging to stand on my toes at times, but not enough to feel like my calfs are getting a work out."
3,Cute but Irritating,"This workout is one notch up from Pilates for Couch Potatoes, but is not a serious pilates workout in my book at least (and I am a pilates novice).Also the ""ballet"" work is pretty much nonsense. Ten plies holding a chair is not what I had in mind when I bought the video. You won't get ballet dancer legs (male or female) doing this workout.What you will get is a headache listening to the irritating instructors making chit chat. Cute but irritating."
3,"York is annoying, Dozios is a good one","I liked both of these instructors from their back up roles to LEISA HART in Buns of Steel, both now York is a bit goody and annoying but Michelle Dozios seems to be getting better. She's a cute one and fun, and this Pilates is so much better than Stott. I liked it."
4,Challenging Fun Work Out,"When I bought this tape, I was really excited to try Pilates for the first time as well learn ballet moves. I thought this would the perfect match to compliment my yoga regime I practiced. I love the pilates section. Incredible and easy to understand the hype on why pilates work. I actually wish they featured pilates a little more in the work out. The ballet was very fun and really did give a new perspective on ballerinas. In fact, the only complaint with the tape is the yoga section. I do not believe its give a first time yoga user a true perspective on what yoga really is about and can do for your body. I really did not enjoy the yoga section at all. But, for the pilates section and the ballet section alone. This tape is completely worth the investment. Very fun, challenging, and definately makes you want to work."
4,Great variety!,"I have a lot of pilates/yoga tapes and this one is pretty good because it adds a lot of variety and the instructors are fun. It has a good pace that keeps you going beginning with a yoga/pilates section and finishing with a ballet section to help with balance and to tone the legs.This is a good workout and a lot better than their other tape they made together with the same pilates/yoga theme. (That one is so boring, I did it once and threw it away) This tape is different because it keeps things moving along."
4,lot's of Fun!,"I'm new to Pilates, and I am hooked. However I get bored of doing the same routine, this tape was fun and offered a lot of variety in movement. They had two instructors that showed beginners and advanced moves. And it was a great length, about 40 minutes. The girls are motivating as well."
3,2/3 of book not about Gettysburg,"The other reviews make it sound like this book is solely about Gettysburg. Most of the book is about the men of the 6th and their experiences in the first year of the war (when the 6th and the rest of the Iron Brigade saw no real action). Although generally well written and packed with primary sources, I don't understand why the authors spent so much time on the first year, then barely mention Brawner Farm, South Mountain, and Antietam. Then, 170 pages in, they finally get to Gettysburg. Well-written and worth a look. It's just not the book the title makes it out to be."
2,An average read,"Herdegen is a great writer and completely in love with Wisconsin troops during the Civil War. Problem is, he's too in love with them and cannot handle the topic objectively. Even though this is one of his early works, he covers the same topic with a better sense of balance in some of his later publications. You can skip this one and go right on to some of his Iron Brigade histories and get the same story. He's written much better stuff lately anyway."
2,Misleading Packaging...BEWARE,"This album, while having some damn good music really ticked me off. I bought it...today, looking for a good Ralph Stanley album. The packaging represents it as being 25 tracks of Ralph Live At Mclures, featuring various other artists. I was surprised to find out that this album was a compilation from a bluegrass festival....only including six tracks with Ralph Stanley. If you are looking for a Ralph Stanley CD...this is not the one to buy...If you are looking for a good bluegrass compilation...this one is pretty good, although I reccomend Bill Monroe's ""Bean Blossom"" over this one. Someone ought to complain to REBEL records for being so misleading. By the way, Don Reno is a [cruddy] banjo player."
1,For Dummies,"When they say that this is for dummies, they are not kidding! You can get more(and better)information from the seed packet. A total waste of money."
5,OUT OF THIS WORLD,NOBODY DOES IT BETTER THAN JOHN DUFFEY AND JOHN STARLING.IVE NEVER HEARD A SWEETER VOICE THAN DUFFY IN MY LIFE AND NEVER WILL AGAIN!.HE WILL BE TRUELY MISSED.
4,GREAT SHELF,"We ordered and install two of these shelves, one in each bathroom, 2 months ago. They were easy to assemble and looked like the advertisment picture. The only issue I have with them is they only have two mounting holes to mount them to the wall and the wall anchors and screws that were supplied were to light weight for something that will have towels and such placed on it. I went to a local hardware store and bought some dry wall anchors that will carry a 75lbs load each. I used two of them. They self tap and screw into the drywall with a cordless drill without predrilling. With these anchors, this shelf is solid and will handle the load of multiple towels, washclothes, etc. If the company would have provided sufficient wall anchors, I would have rated this five stars instead of four stars."
3,"Good Temporary Solution, But It Does Rust","I bought this for an apartment that had absolutely no bathroom storage. Because it was a temporary living situation, I did not want to spend a lot of money but needed to get something. This was the perfect solution (also easy to clean). It did rust, especially around the joints, in about 8 or 9 months. I would not buy this again for a more permanent solution to bathroom storage, but for the price it was great, and it definitely did its job."
2,Rusty!,I actually bought this same product at B.B&B.; It installed easily enough and it looked nice... for about 2 weeks. I haven't taken it down because it will leave big holes in the wall- but it is rusted ALL over and looks horrible!Don't waste your money unless you are using this in a room OTHER than the bathroom.
1,Not enough anchor points,"This product is mounted to the wall with only 2 screws, one on each side. Do not plan on putting any amount of weight, like extra towels, on it as the mounting won't support it! Also the bars on the bottom swing, they are not fixed. Sent mine back and am looking for something decently made."
5,Very Nice,"Make sure to check the dimensions because this rack is not small, but the end result is a good quality, well-priced, easy to assemble and install (and only requires two wall holes), very functional bathroom shelf. And it looks very much like something you'd see at a spa or nice hotel. I am pleased so far and just hope it holds up as well as it came together."
4,Double bathroom shelves and towel holder,This shelf unit is ideal to put guest towels and washcloths for them to reach from the shower. I placed it over the toilet so it can also be used as a hand towel holder and saves putting another towel holder up. Chrome is beautiful and quality great. Would recommend it to anyone needing more space.
2,"Lightweight, sturdy, stylish...might rust","We bought this to mount above our toilet since we didn't want a clunky wooden cabinet (they all looked so old and boring). It was easy to assemble (make sure to add the towel racks before tightening it all together) and mount to the wall. The shelves are a bit on the shallow side, but not too bad. The only downside to this unit is that I've noticed a small amount of rust on the underside of the shelves due to the amount of moisture in the bathroom.Otherwise this guy looks AWESOME and you can't beat the price!UPDATE:Had to knock this down from 4 to 2 stars. The amount of rust that has accumulated on this thing since I bought it is CRAZY! For a bathroom shelf, they didn't really think this one through."
5,Polder Towel Rack,"The towel rack was exactly as described, delivery was prompt. I couldn't be more pleased."
5,Rose is nobody's fool . . .,"What a genuinely wonderful book; I haven't gone ""Oh,ick"" once. In a world of increasingly simplistic solutions and worn-out pseudo-wisdom, this is a rare joy. Good, helpful, affectionate ways to regularly make your life, and the lives of those whom you love, sweeter and stronger."
5,Awesome,This is a great classic surf guitar CD! Its hard to find music like this these days! The CD was delivered on time for Christmas and made a great gift!
3,perhaps a frind,I really thout this was the ventures greatest hits missing 35% of there best music I would really like to here all their greatest hits
3,A Long Time To Spend In One Room!...,"SYMPATHY has its good and bad points. The best thing is the ending, which is one of the coolest, twistiest I've seen in any thriller. The final 15 minutes are priceless and intense. The problem lies in actually getting there, as the 103 minute run time of the film tends to drraggg. This is magnified by the fact that the entire movie takes place in one tiny motel room! Now, this adds to the tension and claustrophobic feel, but it just seems to go on forever, at times going back and forth over the same conversations. If they could have sliced off about 15 minutes of dross, this would have been a classic. As it stands, while still quite watchable, it has many tedious moments that take away from the suspensefulness of the whole..."
1,Sympathy not worth buying,I purchased this video expecting it to be more than just one long continuous scene in a hotel room. I soon grew bored with it.
3,Thriller,"Not a bad storyline; could have been a GREAT erotic thriller. Overall not bad but if you can, rent it, don't buy it."
2,snozzing room,I could find nothing intersting in this movie.Takes place in a sleeze bag motel wow!!! this is not worth the time of day.Save your money go unto the next.
2,Good Try.,"Overacted, poor audio, no closed caption, impossible connection after what those 2 guys did to each other. Nothing original."
3,Get a whole size bigger....,"They are a very cute shoe, didn't feel comfortable to me, which I bought them for.."
1,T-I-G-H-T,"These shoes are as cute as they look, but they are NOT TRUE TO SIZE A-T A-L-L!Surely the manufacturers know this. They are narrow and short."
5,Best work shoe,"After a decade and a half of wearing Birkenstocks in the operating room, I have found the Tsubo to be a far superior replacement, and they are always generating positive comments. These sure are kicky."
5,l I Want For Christmas/A Grandpa For Christmas,thl I Want For Christmas/A Grandpa For Christmas is i a great pair of movies great price too fast shipping great product
4,Paper recommendations for ip4000,"I found nothing to dislike about this printer except for performance on plain paper, expecially in Standard Quality. I have tried different papers (Hammermill, HP, Office Depot, Kodak) on this printer and finally found somewhat a match for it for both text and graphics. Here it is:Plain: Kodak Bright White Inkjet Paper (110+ brightness, 24 lb. 90 g/m2, $6.00 at Office Depot). Works with either Standard or High quality plain paper setting.Plain (second choice): Office Depot Color Inkjet paper.(HP Bright White is terrible for this printer in Standard mode. It produces smears for blue. Hammermill is not much better.)High Quality: Epson Matte Paper - Heavyweight. This paper is excellent for color photos when you set the driver to use Matte Paper Photo or High Resolution paper.Hope that helped."
4,Our experience could have been better...,"We got the printer quicker than we had been told and got it up and running with a minimum of trouble. Unfortunately, it failed the next week. Canon sevice was fast and efficient and finally determined the printer had to go into service or be replaced. A local service shop could not do anything for 10 days so opted for a new printer which arrived in two days. So far, so good.Our only other complaint is that it sometimes can be slow to print."
5,Great Printer,"This printer does everything I need it to do, quickly and efficiently. The price is down to earth and the quality is top notch. Easy to set up and customize. Too bad Canon doesn't make this model any more, but I expect to get a lot of time out of it."
5,Long term use,"I've been using mine since 2005, and it has never let me down. I've used various aftermarket cartridges and refill inks, and various papers. It keeps plugging away, and even prints cd's thanks to a friend in Germany who got me a tray for it. I really don't know what I'll do when this printer finally stops working.Simple, cheap ink tanks with NO stupid chips! Ink low? Squirt some in and keep going, or replace the tank with a super cheap aftermarket. A nice flat paper cassette like the hp's, and a top feeder for alternate paper types like an epson. Or, fill both and tell it to switch off automatically. Built-in duplexing! No need to buy an expensive add-on or figure out how to reload the paper to print the second side. Of course, the PictBridge direct printing works perfectly with my Canon cameras."
5,Everything it was reported to be,"I purchased this printer based on the user reviews. It is everything it was reported to be. Fast, great resolution, and although printing pictures was a lesser consideration to this purchase, I am amazed with the clarity and depth of color. There is no need for me to send out my digital images for printing any longer. This is an incredible printer at an unbelievable price."
2,I'M NOT IMPRESSED!,"This printer seems to print photos with a pink hue and nothing seems to get rid of the problem. Photos that print fine on color HP printers, print with a pink hue on this Canon printer...I've spent time on the phone with tech-support and they were unable to resolve the problem. Buy this printer at your own risk, you've been warned...I highly recommend HP printers, which is what I nearly purchased instead of this one!Don't make my mistake."
2,Defective after printing 2 photos,"I searched through all of the photo printer reviews and settled on buying this printer. I set it up, printed 2 photos, and now it makes loud cracking noises and won't print anything because the print head is not alligned correctly. I called customer service and was told that I will have to take it to someone for repair. Of course, I haven't had time to do this for 4 months now. I live in Manhattan and lugging this big printer across town is not easy. I just wanted a printer that would be easy to set up and use...to SAVE time...instead of developing film the traditional way. For now this printer is just collecting dust."
3,Became a disappointment,"Printer functioned very well for about 6 months, but then failed to print colors properly after that? Replacing print inks, print head, cleaning the print heads, reinstalling the program, etc. failed to make any difference. Of course I had the exact same problems with an earlier HP photo printer, and a later Canon photo pinter using different PC's? I suspect that these printers have a built in design to make them disfunctional after a given amount of usage to force the user to purchase a newer product. Nothing would surprise me."
4,Somebody at Canon had been listening,"When we took this printer out of the box, we noticed a few things right away. First, the printer is a completely rectangular box when all the covers are closed. Second, the controls and buttons are all in the front of the printer. Somebody at Canon had been listening to a focus group :-)Wouldn't know it... a flawless print the first time out of the box! We trimmed the photo to fit our frame and completed the entire birthday present project for our friend Kathy in less than 5 minutes :-)[...]"
4,Great,I needed to replace the one I had and yes it is working good and even better adter I replace the printer head. Thanks
4,Light hold with definition and separation,"It didn't work when I had very short, hair. My hair is generally stubborn, coarse, and straight. Now that my hair is longer, about earlobe length, it's great at creating piecey clumps without making my hair stiff. I don't know about using it to create more body, but I do know that you need to let it dry in order to create a ""dry"" style. The matte finish gives that natural effect to my style--like I just woke up, ran my fingers through my hair, and walked out the door. COOLNESS!"
1,Hellooo???,"I don't know if this can is expired, or my hair is too thick (it's not), or what, but this can did not do jack! I sprayed and sprayed from dawn to dusk and nothing! This is supposed to give your hair volume, correct? Not just sit there and weigh your hair down? Whatever, back to the beauty supply store, I guess."
2,Dissapointing!,"This is the poppiest TNT release to date. TNT can rock hard with the best of them, but not on this one. Lack of riffs, full of drum machines and tinny production, make this one of my most disappointing releases of the year. I've been a TNT fan since Tell No Tales. All I can hope is that they comeback with a more straight ahead hard rock record next time. If the whole album was more like the standout tracks ""Just Like God"" and ""The Whole You're Inn"", it could have been great."
4,Best mix of yesterday and today!,"TNT has done what most of the 80's metal bands could not do- evolve a sound that incorporates the best of all forms of rock in the last 20 years. Tony Harnell is, without a doubt, the most underrated singer in rock today.This CD is a must for all melodic rock fans. The only reason for the absence of a fifth star is the production could have been a little ""bassier"", a little less on the treble end. But that is very minor and should not let anyone deprive themseves of the superb writing skills of Harnell/LeTekro!Buy this one today!"
4,Better than I'd hoped.,"Note: I'm not one for long reviews...I'm a big TNT fan and was let down (a little) by ""Firefly & Live"". The live stuff was what I wanted, but the new stuff sounded forced.""Transistor"" does a better job of capturing the strengths of TNT while showing that they are trying to progress musically. There are modern rock overtones, but you can hear the talent (and heavy metal roots) that might have drawn you to the band.Highlight? Tony's voice! He screams his fool head off and it's quite impressive. Nuno has many chances to shine as well...If you're a fan I have to recommened this one. If you're just getting into the band, start with ""Tell no Tales"" or ""Knights of the New Thunder"" and go from there."
3,hey!,"i havent heard it yet, but i will check it out for sure. i just know that Tekr is an awesome guitar player and hes the reason i buy TNT. If you want a guitar player with a signature sound check it out. there arent too many of them out there!Firefly was their best and i suppose they cant top that one."
1,This stuff is terrible!,"No decent guitars, no decent vocal harmonies, nothing good on this cd. If you're a fan of the other TNT stuff, like Tell No Tales, Intuition, or Realized Fantasies, you're in for a dismal time. If you like hard-rock bands turning to electronics for help, due to a lack of inspiration or a need to try to keep up with the likes of Reznor or more recent bands, then you're in luck. Basically, no soul in this. It'd be great if bands like TNT could stick to what made 'em great before. However, other folks, like the Scorps, have done the same thing, so I guess it's no surprise, ... Others, like Dokken, have been able to evolve, but not succumb to the electronica sound. I guess you choose your audience, though, but I can't imagine this even appealing to those that like the electronic junk with no soul, as it is by a band with no experience in it. Sorry, had to mention soul twice...Have fun setting your beer on this plastic coaster."
3,Not exactly what I expected!,"Shipment was very quick, packed very well in the box.First, the bottle is not the best container for this particular oil, don't leak but when pour outside get oily.Second, not easy to be absorbed by the skin sits on skin for long time. The most important thing is that make my eyes irritated. At the beginning I was thinking that somehow I have some in the eyes, last night I just massage my cheeks with the oil and my eyes start burning, same as before. Now I have to use it only for my hands and body, no face."
2,Overpriced,This same oil was at 19.99 for 8 0z and now they markup their price to 43.90!Ridiculous. Don't be greedy! Dont jump your price from 19.99 to 43.90! that far too much! Disgusting!
3,MEH...JUST OKAY,"Having used the Tarte version of this oil and after reading the high praise from other reviewers I ordered this product. It does NOT sink in to the skin like the Tarte Maracuja oil I've used...it's just ""okay"". The price is fantastic to a point where it should have occurred to me that something might not be what I hoped. The other MAJOR problem I had was I placed a separate order at the same time for my sister as a gift. When my package arrived I was shocked (and embarrassed) at how awful the presentation was...just the bottle alone, no box, with a piece of clear masking tape squashed down over the cap (to hold it on during shipping, I guess). The shipment was in a mailing envelope and the plastic bottle was oily, so some product may have leaked out. I immediately called my sister and apologized for the crappy-looking gift! She was gracious, but I'm still chagrined."
1,It doesn't make wonders,"I wanted to get it because of the great reviews about it, but after using it for few months now I can tell you that it's not better than any oil that moisturizes your skin like baby oil or organic coconut oil which I use now on my face and everywhere and loving it because my skin drinks it very quickly so it vanishes in no time. As for the Marcuja oil, it is very light but it's hard to distribute evenly and then it just sits on the skin. It does moisturize, it has no smell which is good, it didn't cause any irritation nor caused my skin to break out. I now have this brown plastic bottle under the sink and I use it on my body honestly just because I have it and it's a shame to pay 40 something dollars and then not use it. In short, I didn't notice anything about it that makes it a great moisturizer and I recommend you spend 40 dollars on something else."
3,Color book,This is a colorful book with lots of pictures and content but I wish it were less like a story and more factual.
2,Not What I Expected !,"While I am glad to have this installment in my collection, it lacks the punch in the gut that Ilsa She Wolf Of The SS has! In this one Ilsa is oh so weak and the violence is minimal!Ilsa's two sidekicks steal the show and while it is worth owning, it does NOT live up to the controversial first installment! I myself would pay no heed to anyone else's review, but all I can say is unless you are collector like me you're gonna be dissappointed!"
2,Very Poor Ilsa movie,"The worst of the Ilsa movies. Poor story, not much sex and even less violence. And, if this is even possibles, the acting was below a B grade movie.Unless you are a collector and want all 4 don't waste your money."
2,Not Particularly Good,"This DVD version isn't the best quality and it appears as if someone just transferred the film from VHS to DVD. I personally could also tell that it was not the entire feature length film, being that some parts from the original had been cut from this version. All in all, not what I was looking for - but I'm not surprised considering how cheap it was."
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"You will feel really foolish if you waste $30 on this waste of plastic.If you are curious, you can rent this, you'll probably still regret wasting your time on it though.This is cheesy beyond cheese. It's not gore, its not s&m;, its not even cheap comedy.Not worth the time it takes to watch...even if you fast forward through it!"
1,cheezy flicks release ....god awful transfer and cut by several minutes....the worst,"Blurry,washed out and colour faded,nearly impossible to watch. Otherwise it's a masterpiece of sleazy,goodtimes ,intentionally funny(high camp)exploitation masterpiece.Your best bet is to try the anchor bay release....if your budget allows ya ta pay the bloated price!"
3,Ilsa takes a side-step,"Definitely a step-down from ""She-Wolf"" in terms of thrills and sleaze, ""Harem Keeper"" is still a worthy sequel that delivers some gruesome moments and some campiness. The two topless black chicks are definitely a highlight of the film. This DVD is the first time the movie has ever been officially available uncut (the Videatrics VHS was missing some of the sex scenes in favor of gore and the American Video VHS was vice-versa missing gore in favor of the sex) and it looks great in this widescreen presentation. Once again, Anchor Bay serves up the original trailer plus another halfway interesting commentary track featuring Thorne and Edmonds. If you're an Ilsa fan, this is a must purchase...others may get somewhat bored between the sleazy scenes."
4,wide information of chemical peeling,I'm a plastic surgeon. Obagi's method of TCA peeling was introduced to my country about 7-8yaers ago. Now this method is the most widely used by plastic surgeons and dermatologists in my country. This book has wide information about chemical peeling and will be a good guide for surgeons and dermatologists.
4,Almost perfect,"Except for the faulty plastic cover, this cd was what I expected. The cover falls apart when opened. What can be expected when something is used? Can't be like new."
2,Not quiet a biopic of Ken Kessey,The video was more a biopic of the extremely impoverished individuals who live in their often run down rv/bus/vans. Many used drugs and have mental illness. Not a biopic about Ken Kessey or the 60's generation rubber tramps as the title would suggest.
5,"CRITICAL information, no matter who you are!","This book is packed with information that will help you if you've never bought a home, or have done so a dozen or more times. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, should read Chapter 3 on selecting an Agent... If you are buying, selling, thinking of a career in Real Estate, or are already an Agent!"
1,Mississippi Cha Cha Slide 2007,I visited NYC a couple of months ago and purchased this from a street vendor. I tried placing an order for this single last year through Amazon but it took too long to become available.
3,Be Careful What You Wish For,"If you want a collection of historical documents, this is the book. If you were hoping for some analysis and personal insight into Dyna-Soar, we will still have to wait. I personally was very disappointed in this book, however I understand that this type of raw detail may be entertaining to others."
5,One of my favorite Country Gentlemen CDs,"I have a lot of Country Gentlemen LPs and CDs since they are one of my most favorite bluegrass performers. This one, however, is unique because of the live environment. I have many of the same songs from other LPs and CDs, but actually prefer these live versions. This particular set of Country Gentlemen performers, among the many who have been with the group's main man, Charlie Waller, seems the best to me, and in front of an appreciative audience, they are clearly doing their best work. You cannot go wrong with this CD. Worth every penny."
2,Kinda Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed, thought I would hear a little more of Keith but was not to be. If you are a true Keith fan pass this one up."
1,Will not read this book to my child a second time,"I was surprised, and then angry, when I read this book to my child. Ants who come to burn your house down are troublesome and floods are trouble, but the worst trouble is a woman. The world does not need a book to help perpetuate demeaning female stereotypes.We will NOT be purchasing any more of these books."
3,Good but....,"I really enjoyed the book; however, there was too much unnecessary cursing!! While maybe the author felt it necessary to include the excessive four+ letter words to make his point, it did not add value to the storyline. I especially did not approve of the cursing by the so-called little sister, Erika--very distasteful. The storyline portrays the brothers as protectors and big brothers. Personally, I don't know of too many big brothers that allow their little sisters to curse in front of them. The storyline was great and easy to follow, but again COOL IT on the cursing--your audience will probably increase."
4,Nothing But Trouble!,"I really loved this story and have been waiting for years for Marcus to complete Ibn's story but 4 guys is an excellent read. This is the story of 4 frat brothers who are glued by the love of their deceased frat brother's sister Erica (Bunches). Very entertaining antics featuring player Ibn and his ""alleged"" infidelities, baby mama drama Dexter, pushover Colin and nice guy Mike who has a secret love for Erica. Great reading, you will not be disappointed."
4,All That Trouble,"Ibn, Colin, Michael, & Dexter have all known each other since college when one of their closest buddies died a promise of sincere gesture of watching over his baby sister is made but when that little sister is all grown up and graduating from college the brothers take in their own hands to make sure that she is taken care of. Erika is a medical student who has fallen in love with one of the brothers and isn't too sure what to do about it. When all of the brothers are known to act on feelings a test to discover how far everything goes is set into place.Erika plays the lady model in the lives of the brothers she is known to give them advice on their lady friends and she is known to scold them when they have done wrong.Marcus Major took you into to examine the male and female heart. This story is something that makes you learns to accept the items of love."
4,"Funny, Funny, Funny","I've always enjoyed reading about male friendships and this book was very funny and at times thought provoking. We have Dexter-trying to do the right thing but not exactly enjoying it; Ibn-the classic fine brotha with his demented views of women; Mike-the good guy until......; Colin-the doormat (I found myself praying that he would see the light); and finally Bunches-who taught the guys a few things about the opposite sex. This book will make you laugh at some of their shenanigans. I had a hard time putting it down to do the necessary things in life. I had to know how it ended. However, I did find myself wondering about Mrs. Truitt because there was no mention of her after her departure. Although I found it to be a funny and appealing book, it did enlightened me to some of the thoughts, hopes and dreams that men have. Get this for a quick and lighthearted read! Oh-Tiffany, way to go, LOL!"
5,It's a Winner,"""Four Guys and Trouble"" is full of fun, excitment, romance, and drama. From the beginning, you will find yourself laughing out loud at the panks of Ibn, Mike, Colin and Dexter; four guys who believe they got it ""gonnin on"". Wait til you meet, Ibn. No one compares to him, with his never-ending advise on women. (or should I say....) Bunches is smart, sexy, and she has a way with getting what she wants from all of the friends.Marcus has definately written a story that will be talked about for a long time. If you loved ""Good Peoples"", you will want to read this one too."
4,A must read for the Brothers!,"Our book club read this novel as our selection for the month of May. Although the plot was somewhat predictable, the book was well written and kept each of us turning the next page anticipating the twists and turns that the storyline would take. The loyalty that the men showed to each other was refreshing and commendable. Overall, the club felt that this was a good novel and that Marcus Major definitely has the skills to become a serious player on the black literature scene. His next book will definitely be on our list!"
1,Try again marcus try again....,"This is one of the worst novels I have ever read. the characters are all cardboard sterotypes, the plot is silly and the story goes nowhere. You wil be bored by all the trite and cliched dialogue. A book that is all flash and no substance. Try again Marcus try again....."
1,I tried TWICE.....,"I just couldn't get into this book. I didn't even get pass chapter four. I tried reading it twice, but it was lacking a plot and the characters were undeveloped. Sorry, but I would not recommend this one to readers who have a short attention span."
5,What can I say?,"I LOVED IT! This book was so good I couldn't put it down. And like the other reviewers before me said, Marcus made you feel like the characters were real and we've known them forever. I also read ""Good Peoples"", it was good, but this was great. Keep it up Marcus."
3,I'm still trying to finish it,"I haven't gotten past chapter 4 yet, and I've had this book for a little bit now. I just can't seem to get into it. I mean it looks like it's a good book and all, but I just can't get into now. I mean I read his other book ""Good Peoples"" and it was excellent. Maybe when I'm in the mood to read it again, it might be better. I'll let you know in the future."
4,a fun book about the Greek myths!,"As the title suggest the book describes the top ten Greek legends but each one is written in a different style, from an angry letter to Zeus, a play, a newspaper article or a police report in the case of Oedipus and I think this makes the book even more interesting. It also has top ten facts in between each legend from a list of the most powerful gods to a list of mythological criminals and their punishments.As it is written in the same style as the horrible histories (and by the same author) it is light and easy as well as funny (if slightly cheesy) and goes into another depth to interest and entertain the reader without boring them.If you're attracted to Greek mythology but don't want to go into too much depth I think you'll like this, i certainly do!"
2,another fong namm disaster,"i used to have another fong namm cd on nimbus, i sold it for its endless repetition with no variation.I know thai music often contains long wooden xylophone repetitions but this is balanced by entertaining thai mouth organ ,strings and other instruments. this outing seems even worse than the nimbus cd every track rhythm is the same, the drum is an occasional moderate punctuation but the wind instrument can barely be heard, so either thai composers have been rubbish for a thousand years or fong namm and /or their producer have wax in their ears.i have some excellent thai music on the world music library label and ethnic label."
2,Ok,This DVD set is ok if you already have a workout routine and want to supplement it with some new moves. There are some new exercises but there are alot of traditional ones as well - this is good as a supplement. It also isn't very good if you want a workout DVD to motivate you - the man in the video seems a little lecherous and he directs his models on how to do the exercises. The models look like they are on drugs or they are robots - they don't smile and have this strange vacant expression on their faces.
5,Crimson Glory is back!,"I don't care what anybody else says, I really like this new album from Crimson Glory. And while Midnight no longer has vocal duties, his replacement Wade Black does a superb job. I will admit though that he sounds more like Rob Halford. Each of these songs is quite powerful in its own way. My faves on this CD are War of the Worlds, Astronomica, Edge of Forever, and Cydonia. Overall, Astronomica manages to recapture most of Crimson Glory's power after the Strange and Beautiful debacle and moves it into a slightly heavier and more powerful direction. Definitely worth the money. One of the best metal releases of the decade."
1,THIS IS THE COMEDY ALBUM OF THE YEAR!,"What a ridiculously bad joke of an album this is. Anyone who liked this band in 1988 will find them outrageously silly in 1999. Crimson Glory is a band who could have had a long career (like Queensryche), but their egos destroyed the whole deal. Transcendence is one of the Top 10 best Metal albums ever, but by the time Strange & Beautiful came out Crimson Glory had all but destroyed themselves by losing their original drummer and the key element to the band: vocalist Midnight (who sadly isn't even the vocalist for this CD). This album tries to capture some of their former ""Glory"" (sorry, had to be done), but it comes off as a badly produced, long-overdue, criminally sad attempt to make some badly needed cash off a band that was over ten years ago. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this terrible excuse for an album."
4,Astronomical indeed...,"Their all-time masterpiece is,of course,1987's'Transcendence',however,Crimson's new opus,featuring the new vocalist Wade Black comes very close,amounting to a great power metal album capitalizing on themes such as the Cosmos and UFO's."
3,Perhaps too heavy for the sake of being heavy,"My version of this CD contains 3 live songs recorded with Midnight. This is the highlight. There are some good songs on the new CD but they sound even heavier than when they started, perhaps too heavy without the catchiness of STRANGE and BEAUTIFUL. And for those of you putting down STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL, I rate that CD up there with BLIZZARD and DIARY by Randy/Ozzy. The CD is that good! I was hoping they'd continue in that direction. But then again I also really like Queensryche's HEAR IN THE NOW FRONTIER."
3,What happened to Glory?,"This is NOT Crimson Glory at their best, nor their worst, but I really miss the good melodies and creative guitar-solos. Some of the riffs are undoutably of old Crimson Glory standard, but there's no magic. And there's no way Wade can replace Midnight. Sure, he has the range and power of the best of them, but there's no finesse. There's not the sore emotion blended with the raw fury all packed in a fantastic vocal technique that made Midnight the best metal vocalist ever, even better than, I hate to say it, Rob Halford at times. But I'm sure Wade's a great live vocalist, you can hear it in his voice that he's able to sing that way anytime, and it is of course not possible to fill the shoes of midninght.All in all a descent album, unmistakebly Crimson Glory, still lacking the great songs."
3,I was expecting a Crimson Glory of old!,"I was very disappointed in this cd by Crimson Glory. The music just doesn't have any heavy metal 'punch' to it. The vocals are actually terrible...too much screaming. The vocals could have been toned down a bit overall. This cd had some potential on some of the tunes, but nothing to really write home about. I gave it 3 stars for the cd cover artwork,otherwise I would have given it just 2 stars. I would have loved to hear tunes similar to their first release...but unfortunately, things do change and sometimes for the worse. I think I have bought my very last Crimson Glory cd."
5,Cow license plate cover,"My step daughter is newly licd and decided to make her new white car a ""cow car""... for interior and it's cute. I purchased this as a gift to complete the look. It's plastic, as stated on the ad, and it's cute. It's durable and a great price. I am happy with my purchase."
2,"Lousy fabric, otherwise OK","I did a lot of research before deciding on this one, based on the great review from the Consumer report. It's easy to install, both rear facing and forward facing, and I feel it's safe. The only big complaint I have is the fabric. It wore off in cotton balls after less than 2 months of use, and now with 9 months of usage, it looks quite old. If I were to do it all over again, I probably won't get the Titan, but the Triumph V."
4,Not bad,"This was purchased as an extra car seat for my husbands car since our little one grew out of the infant car seat. It is nice, we haven't used it a lot, I think the only complaint he has muttered about it was about the straps."
2,Why is cheaper at Walmart????,How annoying to pay $25 more here than at Walmart. Same price at Babies R Us. Is it really the same exact thing? Very frustrating.
3,"Slightly flimsy, but good enough","I just bought this case to hold my self-made dulcimer. Since my dulcimer had strange dimensions, this was the only case that sort of fit my dulcimer. It doesn't exactly fit, but if not for the flexible sides of the case, it wouldn't. So, this isn't the sturdiest case in the world, but if you just need a regular case, it's fine."
2,something aint right,"If this hitch were really made for an 05 honda civic, it probably would have been a 30 minute job like the directions say. Had to got get longer bolts and make spacers to get it to clear the trunck. Nobody has obviously ever tried to put it on this car because it won't go with out modifications. I was able to make it work by using mechanical aptitude and extra parts."
4,good hitch,Good instructions and easy mount. Took 20 minutes. The most difficult part was removing the wire from the first bolt after getting that through the hole. The coil came off loose so I had to fiddle with it to make it hold the second bolt properly.
1,WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!,"Do not buy anything from this company! They will lie to you and tell you whatever it takes to make a sale. Then you receive the product, realize you have be ripped off-Guess what?- No RETURN Policy. Good luck even getting them to respond to your complaint.If you order from them, then you are a sucker!You have been warned."
2,Out of Tune,"Came brand new direct from the factory. It is horribly out of tune. My daughter loves it, but would be nice if it was in tune."
2,"Chair broke immediately, could not be fixed.","I bought this for my grandson, at the request of my daughter. The chair broke immediately and could not be fixed. The unit looks good, but sounds awful, and my grandson has hardly used it."
1,sent damaged for xmas and haven't yet sent another one,"I think my title about says it all. I was really counting on this for xmas for my daughter, and it was shipped damaged. And by damaged I mean that all the keys were falling out all over the place and it looked like someone had punched it out! When I called, the company was less than professional and acted like, ""oh great, well, we'll send another one, OK?"" It never came. UPS came and picked up the damaged one, and I waited...and waited...and waited. Called again, ""oh so your asking us to send you another one?"" I said that I wasn't asking, I was trying to find out where the one was that was supposed to have already been sent. ""oh, no problem, we'll send another one."" When can I expect it? ""oh, 3-5 days."" That was probably two weeks ago. And no credit to my card either. Ever since amazon started ferreting out to other companies, stuff like this happens."
5,"""Y solo con un beso,,,,,,,,,,me vuelvo a enamorar!!!!!""","Romeo's sultry voice has captivated me. He makes me want to fall in love all over again, his love songs make me fall in love with love. Aventura have placed ""bachata"" in the major leagues. My favorite is ""Ella y Yo"", featuring my main man ""Don, Don, Don Omar"", great chemisty, se la comieron!! Most lyrics on this CD have a message of social conscience ......of conflicts that many people actually face. Is no wonder Aventura have entitled this CD, ""God's Project""!"
2,Just as I thought.,"The same recycled junk...over and over and over...and that damn ""tu romeeeo"" man! its so annoying the boys are bad they have talent but either you do bachata or do pop...To put it gently...Mediocre...Ill wait for their greatest hit before i buy another one of their albums.Stick with spanish y llegaran mucho mas lejos."
2,IT REALLY FAILED TO IMPRESS,"I have no idea why this group is so popular. I love Bachata and have some of the great interpreters in my record collection. Aventura seems to have rechanneled Shakira (the original Ulu/lu/lu/lating It girl--needless to say, I hate her,) Kahled and Radio Tarifa, reaguetton, everyone and everything but the kitchen sink. For my money: Sergio Vargas."
5,God's Project ~Aventura,This is one of the best albums I've heard. My favorite song is number nine Ella Y yo. I think they did a good jodb woking together to come out with such a great album.I really want this c.d I know I would be listening to it all day.
2,not what I expected,"When I first listened to this cd I expected plenty of good songs typical of Aventura but this just didn't do it at all. I only liked 3 songs(out of 15) on this cd. Un Beso, Ella y Yo, and Por tu orgullo(it's like a merengue-bachata track, really nice) are the only songs that I really enjoyed(lyrics and rhythm). There were 2 other good ones, Angelito and Ciego de Amor and an audition skit which was pretty funny but overall not all that great."
1,Terrible,This is the famous song about fat poeple eating cakes its likewhat the hell not even Nate Dogg makes this song goodLyrics 0/10 production 2/10 Overall 1/10
1,"I used to liked this song, and man....","It's understandable, how the CD, Radio, and T.V. changed my mind. IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE!! He has a pretty lame flow, but the beat was nice, but now I'm sick of it in all places possible. Everytime I hear it I get away from it as soon as possible. My friends hated 50 cent from day 1. Well, I used to say screw them, but now I'm like screw 50. I just can't stand him anymore, and now I don't even listen to his CD anymore. Overplaying of this CD, just made me felt like I wasted money on it, but at least I enjoyed it, until the raido played his hits out."
3,Pretty decent...,"Pro: 1)Clear case so it shows the whole ipod. 2)Comes with a *Speck*-brand generic dock. 3)Top lid and the front lid opens and closes with ease. 4)It stands!Con: 1)The opening on top for the ear/headphone is not wide enough to allow the jack in. So I have to open the top every time I want to use ear/headphone. 2)One-size-fits-all, so if you've got a 10/15G, the case will be big. HOWEVER, it comes with a adhesive foam square so you can slip it in and attach to the inside of the flipstand so that your ipod doesn't wobble inside. Kind of cheesy. Wish they had made cases of diff't thicknesses to accomodate all ipods. 3)Don't take it out too often. It WILL scratch your ipod. 4)The dock is cheaply made. Doesn't really fit too well."
4,Great harmony,"I truly love 3 and 4 part harmony and these guys deliver. Good choice of songs, and they are great musicians."
2,"a neglected masterpiece, a so-so performance","The organ is too loud, almost overpowering, the orchestra is often not in sync with the singers, and the soloists are often flat, particularly the male soloists. The performers are more known for the work with Wagner's music, but this shouldn't keep them from performing music of the early Classical period well.It's a shame, as this particular work is a badly neglected masterpiece. There are private, archival recordings of this work availble, that would be a better way to acquaint yourself with the work.There are some good moments, the soprano's Tremens facta sunt is very touching, and the Quando caeli fugue is quite exciting."
1,Boo. Lid won't stay closed.,"Purchased this to hold my daughter's ever-growing nail polish collection. Seemed perfect. It's nice to see the polish bottles, but not all over the floor! Three times tonight I've watched her fill it and try to carry it two feet and the lid will not stay latched shut. Bottles every place. If you're holding light weight things like cotton balls, then it may work. We're not carrying bricks! Sadly, we will be returning this container."
4,Perfect for what I needed,I purchased this box to use to carry my sewing supplies back and forth to my sewing class. Works beautifully. It holds all my sewing tools easily and is a manageable size. Perfect for what I needed.
3,This supply box works as intended.,"I bought this for storing my Stickles and Liquid Pearls and it seems to be doing a fairly good job. I wanted to be able to store them upside down, but the weird un-smooth bottom of this (it has little circular dips) makes that a little difficult. At any rate, It does what it's meant to do. I am a little concerned about the plastic latch...it's already slightly loose and I'm worried that it may not last through heavy use - and I do tend to grab for the supplies in it fairly often.We'll see."
3,Overall decent...,"This shoe is great in that it goes with a lot and is generally comfortable. However, the ankle strap rubs a little too much (over 10 wears and I still need to wear bandaids to avoid blisters on the back of my ankle) and the actual sewing on the strap broke after only a few wears. I paid full price, which I probably wouldn't do again, but I would pay $40-50 for them."
1,Too bad it had to end this way,"The film is slow, L&H seem as bored as anyone watching, and the music is simply too ""modern"" (as opposed to 30's Jazz). If you are a L&H fan, you should get this as it is their last film, but you you are not too familiar with them yet do NOT watch this film, it's absolutely pathetic."
5,Just a filler item to get free shipping,It was something I bought to finish off my order to get free shipping and was as described.
2,who's doing their R&D??,"I'm baffled by how big these treats are. It's as if there was a misunderstanding at the plant and someone thought they were being made for dogs. My male cat will not eat them unless they're cut into pieces. My female cat won't eat them at all, regardless of size."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed when I first received this book. I can hardly call it a book - it is more like a pamphlet. There are no photos other than those on the front cover. This book is precisely what it claims to be... 50 pages of 101 tips and nothing more. There is not sufficient information to truly make your photos ""sing"" as the title claims. If you are a beginner searching for a good resource, do not choose this one because you will be completely lost in trying to understand what the author is saying. He does not take into account that the reader may not be completely familiar with f-stops or shutter speed, essential information of which he does not bother to explain. My suggestion is that if you want a book that has clear explanations and valuable information on how to take photos, try The Basic Book of Photography by Tom Grimm. This resource provides much more information and truly enlightens you to the art of photography."
4,straight to the point,Barnes is a craftsman. His focus is on getting excellent results. He doesn't worship his equipment or cling to ritual in using it. But he does UNDERSTAND his equipment and makes CHOICES about how to use it so as to get wonderful pictures in many different circumstances. Billy stands in a line of plain-spoken North Carolina artists who willingly share the craft that gives them such pleasure.
2,maybe a good book (booklet) for beginners,"I am really disappointed with this book, probably because i had too great expectations connected with a title. I hoped to find some advice on making good photos rather than general information for the beginners in photography (kinds of film, types of lenses etc.)."
1,What a waste...,Disappointed! What an understatement. This book (actually more of a pamphlet) has nothing to offer to anyone except perhaps the first time SLR owner with *very* limited experience with *any* camera. Don't bother.
4,If You Liked Little Big Man...,"This movie is typical of the 1970's and late 60's view of the bad white man vs. good native American. Similar themes run in the movies Little Big Man and Billy Jack. This video has been edited for television. Key scenes from the original screen version have been deleted which really disappointed me. Maybe they will make a DVD of this classic film some day and sell it as the ""unedited version"". Otherwise the ending doesn't make much sense. The scenery is beautiful and I liked the original so much that I gave it 4 stars. Dawn Wells played a good role and seemed at home under the buffalo robes."
1,Never Received,"I gave this VHS Video one star because I never purchased it.When I saw it was a video tape, I cancelled my order. However, Amazon seems to think I bought it."
2,The Unknown Paintings of Kay Nielsen,"I thought I was going to receive a book quite new, as indicated... it's in a very poor condition.The other ones to buy were almost a quarter of the price. I choosed the most expensive thinking it was going to be awesome. It is not. I'm very disapointed."
5,My find of the year,I am a big fan of Nielsens illustrations and was delighted to see this book available. The format is just right for enjoying these striking pictures. Thank you for making this book available. It is a real treasure.
5,Caution: this 61B is not for the micro-4/3 f4-5.6 lens,This 61B lens hood is for the four-thirds f3.5-4.5 lens. It is not for the micro 4/3 f4-f5.6 lens: for that you need the 61D.
5,There is hope.,"""For most people, having a baby is as natural as breathing air. But for some couples, nothing seems to work properly. If you are childless, you may feel betrayed, cheated, hurt. No one seems to understand. There is no quick or easy way to resolve the problems of childlessness. But there is a path through them, and it leads to hope."""
3,Pretty good unit,"Mine was a pretty good unit though sometimes it would come up with a minimum that was impossible so I sold mine, now I miss it. I'd sayit's a middle range unit, that is it's not the cheapest but it's notthe best either.Battery life was good."
2,Do not buy - cracks easily even in Southern California!,Less than a year after purchasing these covers split in several areas. I am going to try my luck with a polyester cover next as they have much better ratings.
4,Clueless heroine!,"The hero is very likable and very much the gentleman, and the heroine is smart and certainly not a doormat. But, she is much too clueless to be believable, even for a Neels story. I mean, if a guy asks you out several times, kisses you on several occasions, compliments you, accompanies you home to meet your mother, gazes deeply into your eyes and makes comments that infers he wants you to be in his life forever, wouldn't you think perhaps he is interested in you? Well, Emma doesn't, despite her pining away for him. And, for me, that's the problem with Wish With the Candles. I kept thinking how dense Emma was, out of character for such a strong young woman, and how thin the plot. Halfway through I was saying ""oh, come on, already!"" The Big Misunderstanding is weak and poorly done, also.The story is typical Neels, just not one of her best, in my opinion. It is, however, sweet escapism with a very uncomplicated plot. Nothing offensive, no typos or other formatting mistakes. 3.5 stars."
5,He's right on the mark,"Although, I don't like the way he describes some of the people in this book; it's accurate. Anyone who has ever worked at NYPL, QBL, or BPL will find the descriptions of the working conditions very accurate and eerily familiar.The author pulls no punches and tells it like it is."
4,sam roberts 'first' single,"sam roberts keeps it coming ! though 'where have all the good people gone?' and 'brother down' both appear on the iNhuman Condition EP released last summer, i think that the new version of 'where have all the good...' is the one we were meant to hear!! its got plenty more bang and will hopefully break sam and the band into the States and hopefully overseas! good luck boys and keep the tunes coming, looking forward to 'We Were Born In A Flame'"
3,The First Commercial Sam Roberts Single...,"An artist that I can sort of be glad to call a purveyour of Canadian rock. His stuff is awesome bar music.anyhoo, this single is the first from his upcoming album ""we were born in a flame"".his EP, ""The inhuman condition"" was a big hit up here in canada, and this 2 song single features alternate versions of songs available on ""condition""-A radio edit of ""where have all the good people gone?""-an acoustic version of ""brother down""""brother down"", ""don't walk away eileen"" and ""where have all the good people gone?"" have all been carried over to be included on the new album.worth picking up if you are interested in getting all the stuff that this guy releases, or if you are just a fan of ""inhuman condition"".buy ""we were born in a flame"" when it comes out... something tells me its gonna be good."
3,ok,"These are ""ok"". The front of them arrived scratched some. We have had issues with them staying hung up when using just the sticky tape."
4,"Collector, Not a Toy","Keep in mind when purchasing this tractor that it is meant to be a collector's item, NOT a toy. It is not durable and will not withstand 'playing,' even of the gentlest type."
5,SMALL SONIC PROBLEM/SOME EVEN BETTER,"I agree with other reviewers who have praised the great improvements in sound quality over previous releases of these splendid performances. I have, however, noted one problem that I do not recall in earlier releases: occasional flutter and wow that sometimes, for example, makes particular string passages sound as if they are being played with excessive vibrato. This may be a result of going back to the original tapes and in my view only detracts in a small way from the overall excellence of the set. In sprite of the excellence of this set, however, I believe that there are other Toscanini performances of the Brahms symphonies that are even better. I recommend, for example, the performance of the Brahms Third on Guild and the performance of that same symphony on Naxos."
1,Very bad software,"I bought this software thinking my wife could use it to improve her math skills. I was very disapointed. I tried to load one of the CDs, after clicking the install button, it acted as if it was installing the software, then it gave me an application error and the software locked up. I then killed the installation software and noticed that it did install an icon to run the software. The software was very hard to understand. It didn't have any usefull help. It looked like software that was written in the 1980s. Very poor. I write software professionally for a living. I can tell that this software was a bunch of old software that was repackaged to sell as new. The software probably wasn't rewritten to keep up with newer windows operating systems (I am using Windows XP Professional). Keep your hard earned money and do not buy this product."
1,Don't waste your time and money. Hire a math tutor instead!,"Since I'm not allowed to register 0 stars for this math crapware, I'll simply advise to read all reviews of this incredibly BAD program. If adults are responsible for this poorly thought out and produced piece of work, they should be banned from design work for life and returned to the fast food drive up window. If a class of 4th graders is responsible, nice try, but study a little harder before attempting your next project. In short, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS JUNK. The only math you'll be doing afterward is writing it off as a bad investment next April 15th."
3,It wasnt that bad,Like so many others' i read the reviews for this software after i had already purchased the product. Those reviews really made me look for the worst out of this program but once i received it in the mail and tried it out i was pleased.(after i got through the virtual memory problem that i had to figure out that is)I wasn't shocked or excited about what i saw in the program but it looks like it will get the job done for me.It could use better graphics but as long as it delivers on the learning end I'm fine with it.I mean that is the whole reason why i bought it in the first place.The reason i gave it 3 stars was because so far i like what i saw from it so far but as I'm typing in this reveiw this is my first day using this sortware so i really cant say to much about it but I'm satisfied with it.
4,Classic Sparks,"I was introduced to Larry Sparks to listening to my favorite band Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys. Sparks use to sing solid lead for Ralph after Carter's death. This album is for the most part excellent singing and song selection in a traditional and high-lonesome style. I really enjoy ""Love of the Mountains, ""Kentucky Girl,"" and ""Smokey Mountain Memories."" Most of the tunes are classic and soul stirring. Sparks has a unique voice most all traditional country and bluegrass fans will be pleased with. A few songs are weak but for the most part this album is classic singing and picking. Some of the songs will make you feel sad and melancholy, but will also bring dreams and a smile for those who desire a more authentic and simple life."
4,Condensed to the Very Best!,"This compilation of Glen Campbell songs is condensed down to the most popular of his songs. It is all the songs we all love! If you want just a taste of his very best, this is it! My only small complaint is that the sound quality perhaps could have been a little better, but it's not bad. We're enjoying this inexpensive return to the past!"
5,All- Time Favorites,"Been a Glen Campbell fan since the sixties, has all the great songs that I love, very happy to find it at such a great price"
4,Good book! Keeps your attention -- detailed but not dry!,"This account of a cold-blooded double-murder of the killer's ex-girlfriend and his own daughter is interesting and well written. I especially like that the trial and sentencing were covered but without taking up half the book which often happens in true crime; the reader is not left hanging by not knowing how it ends, yet is not bored with dry legal transcipts and life histories of all the attorneys, either. I highly recommend this book!"
3,What Kind of Man Could Kill His Own Flesh & Blood? Only One Named Slaughter!,"Bill Cox does an EXCELLENT job of relaying the tale of Jimmy Slaughter (most appropriately named) who kills his ex-girlfriend, Melody Wuertz, and his daughter with her, Jessica.Readers are given an inside view to the sociopathic tendencies of Slaughter and the reasons why he killed Melody and Jessica. Readers will find it truly amazing how this balding, overweight, middle-aged narcissist was able to entangle the most normal and decent of women into his web of deceit and violence.Very well written and full of detail, this is a recommended read for any true crime fan!"
4,This book portrays a horrible crime but a good true crime read,"This book tells of the happenings of the J. R. Slaughter murders that gained public headlines out of an Oklahoma City suburb in the early 1990s. Slaughter killed his girlfriend and THEIR 18 month old child. He was angered because she would not have an abortion like he has made his other girlfriends. This book shows us that someone who appears to be an upstanding citizen can truly have a dark side. God Bless the Edmond, OK detectives who brought this horrible man to justice."
2,Could have been funnier,"I was expecting a more humorous book, based on the reviews I had seen. Some of the ads were odd, some funny. Not exactly what I was expecting, but a short read with humorous photos."
4,Good coverage of traditional Scandinavian knitting,"Lots of historical information for Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden , Aaland and Finland, with color illustrations. The pattern instructions have black and white charts."
5,Rick Bragg snares the life of poor southern whites.,"Finally someone has paid homage to the heroic tragedy of living poor in the south. It's a stiffening reminder of how determination, perhaps some luck, and a good Mom can bring someone to the point of greatness. Thanks to Rick Bragg for telling our story. Thanks for diving into the muck and mire of alcoholism, poverty, and violence that tortures the poor, the southern, and the white. Thanks also to Rick Bragg for liberating those of us who grew up likewise. We don't talk about our upbringings much because no one has given us permission. Through the heroics of Rick's devoted mother, the tragic example of his father, and the touching kindness of his aunt and uncle someone has finally given us permission to talk about our own struggles. Thanks."
5,A truly touching Horatio Alger story .,This may be one of the most important books I have read in my life. Essentially it is a Horatio Alger story of an individual that raises himself out of abject poverty to a position of high respect and the truly honorable way that a poor family conducts itself even without material resources.This book touched my heart and I'm sure the heart of all of its readers because there is much of each of us in this book.
4,An absolutely wonderful read!!!,Rick Bragg certianly writes like a man possessed to bring forth a story that has to be told. The story is masterfully woven to explain a gripping tale of honest gratitude toward a mother. --One of the most honest stories that I have read in quite a long while.
5,A New England point of view,"My sister introduced me to Rick Bragg when this book came out and I'm reading it again now because it's the sort of book I'd like to write. I grew up in New England and my parents and grandparents were made of the same stuff Mr. Bragg's family is. Instead of cotton fields my people worked in textile mills. But, they lived the same way; drank hard and died young. I have never come across a writer who is able to express the hardships of poverty and the effect it has on family and relationships as well as Rick Bragg. I've been wanting to write a book for 16 years and picking this book up again might just be the nudge I needed to get going on it. If you haven't read Ava's Man, it's just as heart-wrenching and compelling. I love all of his books."
5,One of THOSE books,"I simply enjoy a really good book. And this is one of those books that you want to recommend to anybody and everybody, with rare confidence and without hesitation. Ever so often a someone has good story to tell and knows how to tell it. The reviews are extensive so I'll get out of your way. But before I leave I think that I should suggest a hardback copy because a lot of your friends will be passing this one around."
3,The first half of the book is better than the second,"This book is very interesting while the author's mother and father have an active relationship. His mother is a recluse for the second half of the book so the author focuses on his many accomplishments. His country boy affectations begin to grate. (For example, he has a habit of ending sections with 'I reckon so'.)I thought the whole book was about growing up in rural Alabama; if I'd realized that half of the book was about his adult accomplishments, I would never have bought it."
1,"Bragg guilty of ""bait and switch""","As a handful of other reviewers pointed out, the first half of this book is marked by exceptional writing and memorable characters. I loved the reminiscences of life in the South in the sixties because I also grew up there at that time - it all rang very true and very real. If only he had stayed in the South with his mama and not given over the second half to boring anecdotes about his adult self and his own professional life. I have to confess that I skimmed through this part, hardly believing that the author could have so deliberately alienated a previously interested and sympathetic reader. But he did - and to the point where I have not the least interest in reading the much-touted sequel. All of this points up a dismaying trend in contemporary literature toward unbelievably self-absorbed and self serving ""memoirs"" of folks who have judged their own worthiness as autobiographical material."
2,what a disappointment!,I loved the first half of this book in which Rick Bragg wrote very eloquently about his growing up and his mother. By the end of the book I was so angry I wanted to personally call Mr. Bragg and inform him that people who grow up in middle or upper-middle class backgrounds also have problems. People who are born with money should not be blamed any more than people who are born without it.
3,Rick Bragg,"Rick Bragg describes his journey of life through a collection of childhood memories. His writing releases his emotions that should be captured by all. This book is a wonderful novel for those who havedealt with a troubled childhood.""When God Blinks"" is a great chapter due to his southern home style of life. He gives full detail in the house on the hill. you can close your eyes,and see exactly what he describes.Bragg's weakness of this novel would be the age of the audience.This novel is suited for an ""older"" generation or an open minded person willing to read about a southern broken family.I would recomend this novel to people who are eager to learn about southern living in the 1970's. People from broken homes or people raised by a single parent could grasp a hold of this novel and recollect on their memories."
1,If only this book really was about his mother!,"I've read two thirds of this book, and that might be as far as I can go. I was so hopeful, considering the great reviews, the radio nterviews, the back cover copy. But I think the publishers intentionallly misrepresented this book, positioning it as a Southern Angela's Ashes, rather than as a journalist's brag book. Maybe if I were a man or a journalist I might enjoy, in an ironical way, his ridiculous false bravado and self-congratulatory war stories. But I feel as if I'm trapped on a long bus ride beside a man who just won't shut up about himself. I only care when he writes about people other than himself and his good-ol'-boy friends. Too much cliche, too little real self-revelation or true compassion. Read the first section and then stop."
3,Pretty good but not awesome,"I recently finished ""All over but the Shoutin"" for our book club. I enjoyed it but I must admit I think the reviews were alittle over the top in their praise. Yes, Rick Bragg can write and his story is worthwhile. It's obvious his forte is feature writing. His style is crisp, clean and real. The problem is his lack of modesty and that got in the way more than once. I got tired of him telling us about his prizes and how far he had come. I also got frustrated with the constant foreshadowing of what is to come. Almost every chapter ended with a little tease, like ""that was until I had the Mustang"" or ""I had, by then, a wife."" After awhile, it became irritating. But, don't get me wrong. It was a worthwhile read, it just isn't a masterpiece."
4,The first half is excellent. The second half: not as much,"I really loved the first half of this book, hence the four stars, but he started to lose me around the middle. The end may actually be spectacular but i was in such a deep state of ennui by that point that I was just trying to get through. Perhaps some of his books that JUST focus on his family's past do not have this problem."
4,Bragg,I read this book when it first came out and had an occasion to repurchase it recently for a book club discussion. As I live now in the South and have followed his career in the last couple of years; I find his writing both stimulating and interesting. The group found his descriptions of his Southern long suffering Mother very realistic. Have ordered his new book and look forward to reading it as well.
1,depressing,"Now I know the feeling an ox gets after a long day at work. I was never allowed a chance to smile throughout this slogging, pitiful stench of Southern madness. Doing cop reports at a Myrtle Beach newspaper, the characters ring true, and I remember seeing a large block of ice in a tea-filled tank once at a BBQ in 1961. I loved the voice, the Southern pitch, but after the trudge, it was back to the low intellectual prison of Southern writing when the shouting was over. My wife cussed me out after she checked our account and saw I had wasted our electric bill money on this book."
3,Mom is the star,"The most notable aspect of this memoir is the tenderness with which the author discusses his mother and her tremendous sacrifices to give her children all that she could. For this part, I give the book 5 stars. I otherwise had difficulty obtaining a sense of the author's emotions in other (what would seem to be) highly-charged emotional situations.For additional reading about amazing moms, I highly recommend The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio by Terry Ryan."
1,I could have just read the New York Times....,"I agree with many others when I say the first part of the book was a good read, but I did not care to read about all of his accomplishments, his stories, about how being a journalist is the best job in the world, and about how he didn't need a ""fancy education"" with all of his talent. If I wanted to read about all of the stories he has written, I couldn've just read the New York Times. It is the story of an egotistical journalist, not of a mother. A story of how rich people are somehow bad. A story that makes him feel better about himself. Maybe he should have kept this book to himself instead of publishing it for others to read."
3,A bit less than expected,"Delivered on time, but the quality was a bit less than we expected. Cigarette burns on the page and some food dirt. I wouldn't classify it as very good, only good."
5,a story we all have to tell,"rick bragg's all over but the shoutin is a wonderful tale of those many many people who lived under the ""acceptable""..level of poverty in their lives. i am ten years older than he and thought i had it rough..but when i think about his situation..in the time frame...it makes me greatful for my up bringing ..great work..and i wish him the best.. i hope he never touches that first whiskey bottle..it will be the end of him...and he knows it..."
4,Very honest and thoughtful book,"I found the honesty with which Rick Bragg writes to be almost disarming. The book was a pleasure to read. Thank-You,Dean Matheson"
4,Capote-like in its detailed simplicity,"Upon reading this book, I could readily understand how Bragg won the Pulitzer. It contains a normal amount of egotism for a sincere autobiography; as a retired English teacher, I wish that more of my students had been able to acquire his style and his appreciation of what to some pseudo-sophisticates would be deemed trivial. My emotions ran the gamut upon reading the book - from laughter to tears, and I really think that readers from the South can empathize more with it than the Yankee-types to whom he often refers. I llked it very much!"
5,Real Life,"This is a very personal story of a childhood that almost wasn't, grim rural poverty, and the strength of an unusual woman (Brag's mother). Like Angela's Ashes, it takes the reader to a childhood no one could envy, from which the author somehow emerges as a searingly honest storyteller. Unlike Ashes, however, the author (although clearly scarred) is not bitter (about the baby brother who died, for example). Angela's Ashes made me want to cry; All Over but the Shoutin' makes me want to read everything Mr. Bragg has ever written."
5,Couldn't wait for next book,"I wanted to write Rick Bragg a letter to let him know how absolutely moving, wonderful and funny his book is as soon as I turned the last page. (And I really hated to turn the last page) The relationship between Bragg and his mother is such an uplifting and memorable part of the book. What a strong woman. Readers will definitely know where Bragg inherited his talents from when they read about his mother. I can't say enough about this book. Write more Rick!"
3,Beautifully Written But Wanted More About Momma,"I confess that when I began this book, I felt the writing was a level above most of the books I have read before it. Bragg weaves you through his childhood in a somewhat summary fashion. I wanted to know more. I felt as if he fast forwarded through parts that were integral to the story he sought to tell. I was turned off by the snipets of his newspaper articles that he included. All in all, I really liked it but wanted to know more about his mother, her feelings and what life was like for her."
5,A gorgeous book. Unlike any other memoir you will find.,"Usually I find memoirs to be too full of whining and self-involvement. But this book is so lovely, not just in its elegant writing, but its soul. This is a book about love. Motherlove. Love of place. Love of people. And love of good, old-fashioned work. Bragg faces his demons -- guilt, insecurity -- and admits his imperfections, shortcomings and we can't help but come out loving him in the end. I want to know his mother, his world and I am grateful for the introduction. I'm a Northerner -- I might even be characterized as one of those pointy-headed intellectuals he pokes at. I have been South, but not to Bragg's South. After this precious book, I know must, must see this world before I die."
5,A Book Worth Shoutin' About,"I suppose most of us would like to thank our mothers for all the things they've done to make our lives better. But few have done so with the grace, eloquence, and gut-wrenching truth of Rick Bragg's 'All Over but the Shoutin'. With prose that echoes Faulkner, Bragg takes us on a journey through his dirt-poor southern childhood, introducing us to an alcoholic father, a pair of brawling brothers, and a devoted mother who sacrificed everything for her sons' well-being. And though Bragg fought his way out of poverty to the auspices of the New York Times (ultimately winning a Pulitzer Prize), this is not a syrupy 'rags-to-riches' story. It's a tale of love, devotion, and gratitude, a compelling 'thank you note', if you will, to the one person he believes is responsible for getting him there.Salmon Run"
5,I am an author and writing teacher...,"...and I am convinced Bragg is our greatest living nonfiction writer. Twain and Capote may have been in their day, but this book will convince anyone that Bragg is the man now. Some writers make me want to work harder and write better. Bragg makes me want to bow and surrender. I hate to read a book where you have to read a paragraph twice to catch its meaning. With this one, I read them over 3 or more times, just for savoring. Whenever I teach writing, I start by reading the first paragraph of this book aloud, and then I listen to the hush."
4,All Over But the Shouting,Book was great. The person who recived the gift love it. Thanks for the reviews I read before I ordered
2,A Big Build Up to a Big Letdown,"This books was recommended to me, so I had high hopes. The best part of this true story is how Rick captures life in the south. I loved that. Otherwise, it's just a boring memoir that has too many details."
4,Southern Literature,All Over but the Shoutin is a memoir of Rick Bragg's life. The purpose of this memoir is for Rick Bragg to find himself and who he really is as a person. He also writes about his mother's struggles as a single mother in the south.This book was very well written. Rick Bragg used this book to discover himself. The use of the five senses was magical.It was almost as if you experienced the same things Bragg experienced. Bragg made me think of my life as I grew up in the South.This book deserves a thumbs up! I would consider this as a good read. Many people can relate to the stories that Bragg tells because they have lived them also.
3,Two Different Books,"The book begins with a rambly but beautifully told story of growing up dirt poor in the rural south. Then, at the turn of a page, the author goes from hauling wood and shoveling gravel to typing on a computer keyboard. The book then turns from a wonderful down home memoir to a recounting of the author's journalistic career, where he effortlessly glides to the top.It is almost like reading two different books, and I like the first one a lot better than the second. The book transforms itself from a memoir of his southern roots and family to an autobiography. Unfortunately, Bragg seems to lose his unforgiving vision of others when it comes to himself. The best autobiographies always feature the author's worst quirks and flaws, but we finish this one knowing the author as little more than the Boy Who Made Good."
4,"From Thoughts, To Feelings, To Words","I've been there. I've done that. So glad Rick Bragg had the fortitude to put it into words for all kids, perhaps some yet unborn, subjected to an abusive parent, finding the one stable and loving person who inspired them to continue on and make it after all."
2,Bragg seems to do more bragging than storytelling,"Our book group chose this as our August selection based on the rave reviews. We were disappointed. Although Rick Bragg is a talented writer, he misleads the readers to believe the story will be about his mother and his struggles growing up in poverty. Too much of the book focuses on Bragg and his accomplishments, as if by telling us about these, he need not elaborate on his family. If he's going to talk about himself, I would like to know more about his relationships. He seems to flit over each one, rarely mentioning the names of these faceless women. For a man so gifted at painting a picture, he didn't paint a complete picture of himself. Our book group gave the book a ""C."""
2,No depth,"There may be enough of the hardscrabble South to remind a Southerner of home, but for someone interested in experiencing something of that world for the first time, this chronicle is little help. The physical setting, any insight into what may have motivated his mother's actions, any reflection on why the relatives shared themselves so generously are all absent."
5,I've recommended this book to everyone!,"Rick Bragg's book touched my heart, not only because it was brilliantly written, but also because he captured the joy and pain of being poor and white in Alabama in the 1960s. Before I finished the book, I had to rush out and buy a copy for MY mother! This book is a ""must read"" for everyone!"
5,"Humbling, real and a brilliantly written book","I'm not going to take a long time to do this. The book was released here in the UK as 'Redbirds'. I was looking for something different, something about real people and real lives. I'm nothing like anyone in the book (in some cases good, in some bad!), but that's what I wanted to learn about - different people. I had no idea what it was about, I saw it on special offer in a local bookshop, read the summary, and bought it. It was fantastic - the tales of hardship hit home, but the committment and strength - and humour - of Momma and her family is just so much there. It made me feel humble. Rick B thinks he's had a lot of luck, but a lot of people, like me, are born and brought up in houses with bedrooms, with good mums and dads. He made his luck - many don't."
5,EXCEPTIONAL,"I AM AN AVID READER OF BOTH FICTIONAL AND NON-FICTIONAL BOOKS. THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST WORKS OF NON-FICTION I HAVE EVER READ. IF YOU OR ANY ONE OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF AN ACOHOLIC ABUSER, THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. SO HEART WRENCHING YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. IF THIS IS HIS NON-FICTIONAL WORK, THEN I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO WRITE A FICTIONAL NOVEL. I HAVE NOT ENJOYED A BOOK THIS MUCH SINCE STEINBECK OR CALDWELL!"
3,Mama's Boy,"I read this book after loving AVA'S MAN. I was less enthralled with ALL OVER, which was written first. From reviews, I expected it to be a paean to his momma. That it was, early on and again at the end. But I couldn't help thinking that for a woman to sacrifice so much for her children is not so exceptional--most of us sacrifice more than our children will ever know--and that he was perhaps too attached to her. His lack of any real emotional connection to any of his many ""girlfriends"" made me think that he needed to mature and to depend less on his attachment to his momma. Like other reviewers, I was less interested in his climb to the Pulitzer, but I adjusted to the switch of focus. It turned into an autobiography, and his many ""clips"" from stories that he wrote were very interesting. Overall, I think the second half is just not as gripping as the first and the switch was somewhat jarring."
3,All Over But the Shoutin',"This book is a collection of short story personal memoirs. He wrote this book for his mother, to pay tribute to her for the hardwork and self sacrifices she made throughout his life. And, although Bragg denies it, he uses this book as an attempt to finally face the years of confusion and hate for his father. Bragg's book is very descriptive and alive. He loves to play with language and bring life to his stories. However, he constantly refers to his success and lack of success in relation to his childhood. He also fails to let the book flow...each chapter switches to a new topic. This is a good book for those who love language and reading about people's lives. It is not suspenseful or thrilling, but deserves credit in other ways."
4,A rich life,"What Rick Bragg and his family lacked in money they more than made up for in love and experience. Bragg's memior, All Over But the Shoutin' chronicles the Pulitzer Prize winning reporter's ascent from poverty in rural Alabama to the offices of the New York Times and the pinnacle of a journalist's career. Forever cognizant of class and treatment, Bragg never loses his heritage when rubbing elbows of the Ivy League elite and it actually aids him as a reporter known for covering the stories of the disenfranchised.I am confident that his upbringing, with an alcoholic sometimes-father, but a strong loving mother, in the poorest of poorest towns created the Rick Bragg of today. Perhaps he would have made the same mark on society under different circumstances - but would he have hungered for it and done everything he could to make up for the lack of money, education and sophistication so many others in his field demanded?A sad and inspiring story it is. Rick, you done your momma proud."
5,"Rick Bragg--stories that zing, prose that sings","Rick Bragg is the kind of writer that raises journalism to high art and makes other journalists despair. With honesty and a homeboy's love of home he makes you see, feel, taste, be, love, cry and laugh...lots of laughter. He made me want to be Southern, to be his mama's child, to know him, to hear more. Bragg knows his material, respects his subjects and has the storyteller's gift. Bragg's images echo in memory to rise up and make you gasp when least expected. On preemies in a neonatal intensive care unit he writes: ""Some last for awhile and then slip away like beads off a broken string."" He describes a man ""as cool as the other side of your pillow"" and you know all about him. So fine."
3,southern gothic,"Rick Bragg's ""All Over But the Shoutin'"" describes his American journey upward, out of poverty and despair, through a combination of luck, drive, and talent. This falls into the ""Only in America"" category. There are inevitable detours along the way as he grows up amidst a family whose members are frequently at cross-purposes with each other. His book has been described by an Entertainment Weekly reviewer as ""a son's gift to his mother"", who is presented as near-saintly. (One does have the passing thought that a daughter might have written a memoir with different insights and a different tone.)Bragg has become articulate in the great tradition of southern writers; his book is worth a reader's time."
4,all over,"I started the book after reading a short story by Bragg in Parade. I live in Al.,but am much older than Mr Bragg. The conditions that he relates were very similar to those of the depression years except for the child and wife abuse. I at first thought his book rather self serving,but after reading the entire book,found it delightful,and him interesting"
5,Rick Bragg IS southern Family!,I was not familiar with Rick Bragg until I read one of his short stories in Southern Living - I have read both All Over But the Shoutin' and Ava's Man - both are wonderfully written. They made me feel like I was living that time in history. I just finished Ava'a Man - I wish I could tell my Grandparents how much I loved and miss them now. Both books are wonderful family stories.
2,disappointing,"After all the hype, I really expected to enjoy this. It was same ole same ole throughout the book: boy can't forgive father, noble mother, etc. But, this was a welfare mom who could have worked and didn't."
5,I was drawn in from the first paragraph,"A great story told by a great writer. Southern boy is raised dirt poor by his mother - gains societal approval through attending Harvard and rising to the top of his profession - then comes home to wrestle with his childhood demons. It helps that he's a corespondent for the New York Times and writes like we all wish we could. His style is emotional, direct and very real. Bragg opens himself and his family up completely and we're the better for it. I'll leave it at that and encourage you to take a trip into Rick's world yourself."
5,TFA+,"When I find a CD this good that has been around since 1998, I don't know whether to be glad that I found it or feel stupid for not knowing about it till now. I've played it every day since coming across it, so maybe I've made up for lost time. These guys really have the Deep Elm emo sound down, but with a much more powerful fullness than most Deep Elm discs. Brilliant vocals/lyrics blended into forceful guitar band music. A fascinating synthesis of sound and sincerity. There are no accidents here, every note, sound, and word has a purpose. Every song is a crafted work of experiential art. This is like the doctoral dissertation level of emo music. ""Operator"" is one of the greatest hardcore emo songs ever recorded, a tour de force of power and heart. This song alone would make this a five star CD, but every song is within a hair of being just as good. Only Deep Elm has the guts to put out music this intelligent. Outstanding."
1,"do NOT buy this ""huge kit""","It is not a ""huge kit"" for TSE test takers.It just have introduction what TSE is, and there is only sample which is provided by ETS homepage.This packet is worthless.In the audio cd, there is just recording for seminar that's it!!And, in the preparation cd, there are many unnecessary information such as TOEFL. I am looking for only TSE not TOEFL!!I truly recommend you guys DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
4,for committed readers in physical science and engineering,"One nice thing about a Springer book like this is that the author has refrained from populating many pages with multicoloured illustrations. The latter is now common amongst maths books aimed at introductory calculus [or indeed other branches of maths], where authors figure that they need to grab the attention of a diverse set of readers.This book is directed at students already heading into an engineering or physical science major. The few diagrams are in black and white, but are cogent to the discussion. The level of rigour is not quite that of Spivak or Apostol's books on calculus, or Marsden'sElementary Classical Analysis. Those are meant more for maths majors. The current book's treatment is more than adequate for understanding and using analysis in your fields. As a practical matter, you'll rarely need the rigour of the other texts."
1,This is undeniably the worst instruction book I've ever seen,"So you want to learn the Harmonica? Well look someplace else. This book is pants!!! It goes very quickly on to advanced techniques and stays there.Sure it has about 20 different songs to learn but if your at all like me anything after the first 2 will be nigh-on impossible.The cd has one long track on it for chrissakes meaning you have to ffwd through for half and hour.I am a musically minded kind of chap too. My strong recommendation would be to go a book called STEP ONE: PLAY HARMONICA by Peter Pickow, Jason A. Shulman I had much much more success with it."
5,Beginning Blues Harp,"Don Baker is often considered to be one of the world's finest harmonica players so I thought it would be worth looking at this book. I was delighted to discover that it is not only informative but is also presented in a way that is simple enough for everyone to follow. If you have always wanted to learn the harp-now is your opportunity, with this book you can do it!"
3,Camera case,Tripod does not fit in this case very well. I thought it was going to have a secure spot where it was supposed to go. It doesn't and as a result you have to just put it in the back zipper compartment. This doesn't work very well since it falls out every time you unzip that compartment.
1,Allen Iverson - The Answer,"Limited features. Not explosive like the other Bball DVD's. Slow moving. VERY brief! A few good moves from Iverson, but hardly captures his full array of skills. No mention of the finals against the Lakers. Not at all interesting."
5,Great story.,"The only bad thing about this video is that I wish it was longer. It has his lifetime story and his career in sports. It evn shows the moves he did on MJ back in college. It shows his high school football as a quarterback, special team, and running back and it also shows him playing basketball in high school and in Georgetown. It shows him being the #1 draft pick by the Sixers back in '98. It also shows the tremendous run to the NBA Finals against the annoying Lakers (except Shaq). But it also explains his childhood and his going to jail because of drinking problems. Overall, this video thoroughly explains AI's life and career and even includes some interviews."
5,Wow!,"A brilliant look at the life so far of one of the biggest stars in the NBA. It goes behind the scenes showing all he went through as a youngster, truly inspiring. It also shows how many people believed in him and gave him a chance when others wouldn't. AI is one of the greatest players in the league and this is a great watch for all basketball fans."
5,Get going quickly!,"VBA is a topic that has not yet made it into the curriculum of too many CS courses, at least not at my school. The focus tends to be on formal ideas, taught in Java and C++. But when it comes time to get a job one often needs to learn the VB editor/compiler and VBA overnight. VBA is another child of the OOP revolution, but it can easily be used without extra baggage like UML diagrams. It is not hard to learn, but one still has to learn it.Excel is by far the most popular place to implement the built in VBA language in Office. This makes this book a good starting point, and since it is done in 300 pages rather than the typical 1200 page monstrosity it is quickly digestable.The book assumes modest familiarity with programming concepts. A CS minor looking for a job in business should be able to handle it easily."
2,Not the best,This book isn't particularly good. It feels as if it were written without a lot of thought. The first 13 chapters are a cursory review of VBA; the examples in Chapters 20-41 are mostly trivial. Many of them could be done faster and more efficiently without resort to VBA. You would be better off with another book such as Walkenbach's.
1,Disappointing,"I have tried some of the macros and find that they are poorly constructed, not at all professionally coded and trivial in the extreme. So much for the ""real world"" situations. No wonder there is no CD! Buyers would be much better off with Chris Allbright's Modellers book which not only has a CD but also provides really useful programs in stats, finance, quant etc."
1,deceptively short - find something else,The book has 41 chapters in 296 pages. Most chapters are 3-5 pages long with pictures. All examples are only 4-10 lines of code.The front cover states that it includes 21 real-world projects. However it fails to state that the longest project is 25 lines long. The chapter on databases is 3 pages with pictures. Skip this and find something with some substance.
5,"If you like butterflies, this is a great one","This butterfly is a large charm, that is beautiful, wide, and detailed. It is a really nice charm for a butterfly."
3,Dark Indeed,Dark Channel is the first book I've read by Ray Garton and I found it to be a tense read and hard to put down. It certainly colored my view on people who claim to channel spirits or otherworldly entities. It was a good read. I enjoyed it.
2,Somewhat of a disappointment for me,"I enjoyed Ray Garton's books in the past, but I fell out of favor with this one. Why? you ask. Well, to start, it seems like a trendy move. Frank E. Peretti comes to mind. There exists many novels of Xian suspense/thrillers on the market, and to be frank, this book seems to fall in line with the rest of them. Ray Garton is a good writer, no doubt about it . . . but Dark Channel is too lengthy and riddled with misconceptions on the New Age movement. I'm not a fan of New Age Fluff myself, but I can't imagine that Bael or the Dark One himself is behind it all. True, some the characters are well-written, but with names like ""Jordan Cross"" I felt I was reading a publication by Zondervan. Where's the fire? The macabre satire? The irreligious sentiment? The depth and religious turmoil? Not much can be found here. The whole effort seems to be half-hearted and exhausting."
5,Finger-lickin' good,"This book is great. Young readers won't be able to put it down. Virginia Meachum is great-- she walks on water, sent the Pope to Cuba, and wooed Brad Pitt away from Gweneth Paltrow. And I'm not just saying that because she's my grandma."
5,Excellent book on what you need to know,This is really a good book to help you with the step by steps of being a best man. I agree with the other review that there is much more than ya think. I highly recommend this!
2,A Big Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this book, and really had to force myself to finish reading it. The story line is very contrived, motivation is lacking, the characters lack personality, and there is no chemistry between them, not even Gloria and Matt. And someone of her age should have more common sense than to put herself in danger, like the scatter-brained female detectives in today's chic lit, always rationalizing reasons for keeping information to herself and going out alone at night to meet murderers in dark deserted buildings. Her reasoning is a big cliche! I have to agree with the reviewer who said the plot is full of red herrings. In a good mystery all of the pieces should fit neatly together in the end. This one has a few too many irrelevant pieces left over."
5,Daily readings for your inner child.,A tiny book to reach inside you to your injured child to show her/him a caring adult so that your child can heal. Worth a read!
1,No resembelence to the real thing,"All I can say that Anna Tookson's negative review says it all and, if anything, is a bit generous. There is no resembelence of the renditions in this album to the real thing. If one was strictly interested in documenting the lyrics to the songs this could be a source, but there is none of the energy, fire and roughness that characterizes the real thing. Do a search on the Morgans and get their CD, it is infinitely superior."
3,Men's Chorus Sings Stylized Sea Chanteys,"This collection is sung by a traditional British men's chorus in a more formally stylized way than most chantey CDs, including tricks in timing and other modifications.If you love that style, this is a great album.If you prefer your chanteys sung in a more rough and authentic fashion, however, there are a lot better albums out there."
2,Slow Going,"Hate to be an old curmudgeon, but this collection is a little slow-paced for me. Snail-like tempo on most of the numbers. A better title as far as I am concerned would be ""Sea Dirges."""
2,I was expecting something a little more rousing than choral music.,I bought the album to learn the songs but you can hardly understand the words. Beautiful male bass and tenor voices if you like that sort of thing.
5,Vintage Robert Shaw,"These are not historically-informed shanties. The voices are highly-trained, the ensemble is coherent, and intonation is flawless; the sea breeze in the music is subtle, not strong. But this is not meant to be historically-informed shanty-singing; it's meant to be a bit of fun, a bit of beauty, and an opportunity to enjoy the sound of a full-throated male chorus. It succeeds admirably at all those things. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and was not disappointed. Listen and enjoy!"
4,interesting,"I omly liked a couple of the stories, the bishonen one was my favorite. I thought the art for the most part was average -- not bad, but nothing to impress me. I love that this kind of thing exists though. We should encourage our own manga artist as much as we can."
4,"It is real music, not a cute tourist joke","...I know a little bit about the playing of natural horns -- parforcehorns, hunting horns, natural trumpets. Most of the music for these instruments is boring, or at best, cute. Here we hear a natural horn playing dramatic, serious music across a range of more than two octaves. Quite amazing"
3,A mixed bag.,"I must first admit that I'm not a big Toscanini fan; although I've heard many of his recordings I don't find most of them all that pleasing. The sound here, while better than in past releases is still not terrific even for the early 1950's. I find the Schubert 5th and Mendelssohn 4th rather graceless and overdriven. The Schubert 'unfinished' is very dramatic and different from most you may have heard, at the least interesting. The Mendelssohn 'Reformation' sounds a bit better than the rest, and Toscanini brings some life to a symphony which can seem pretty dull in most hands. That leaves the Schubert 'Great', which is long on grandeur but a bit short on beauty. Where available, such as Beethoven and Brahms, I think Furtwangler's recordings from the same time period are to be preferred."
2,A dissenter,"I seem to be running against the current here; in part I think there are cultural factors at work.I decided to read Bernhard because of his mention at several points in Jonathan Franzen's Freedom. I didn't enjoy this 100-page long novella (which is said to be representative of his fiction and the best point of entry into his work). It is one long paragraph of internal ruminations by a character who shares the author's name (and experiences)--a man who is a sour, supercilious, arrogant misanthrope. This kind of long internal monologue from a disturbed and socially-alienated individual seems a form that Europeans like more than North Americans: I would think its tradition is rooted in Notes from the Underground. And, though I do admire Dostoevsky's version of this, it is rarely something I enjoy. (I did at least like this book better than Michel Houellebecq's extremely sour Elementary Particles, but Bernhard and Houellebecq share in their general world view.)"
3,Fun but...,"An entertaining, albeit thin and superficial novella by Thomas Bernhard about an unlikely friendship between two sick patients in Vienna. The narrator-Bernhard's doppelganger-befriends Wittgenstein's enigmatic nephew despite their improbable arrangement. There are enjoyable portraits of Viennese culture and thought in this brief text-and Bernhard takes plenty of time to write wonderfully about music as he so often does-but there is also a bitterness to this narrative that drags it down. Furthermore, Bernhard uses an extended sequence to berate the Viennese theater culture for the disastrous premier of his play at the Burgtheater-the passage is meant to be funny but it is merely arrogant and petty. Unfortunately, Bernhard has not been able to do much with his admittedly clever conceit in this one."
2,IQue charger,"It was not clear in the product description that this unit is a charger that works only with the IQue cradle. I thought I was buying a unit that plugged directly into the IQue. It doesn't. So, I now have a unit that did not do what I wanted. I already have the cradle and its original charger. Very dissapointed to have spent the money needlessly!"
4,A National Treasure,"Wilma Lee Cooper is truley a National Treasure. A member of the Grand Old Opry since 1957, Wilma Lee is still a vibrant performer, who shouldn't be missed if you have a chance to see her. This CD is a compelation of songs from Wilma Lee's solo career (recorded after the passing of her musical partner and husband, Stoney), but it is only the tip of the iceberg. For the true hardcore Wilma Lee and Stoney sound, seek out ""Walking My Lord Up Calvary Hill"". A definative multi-CD collection of Wilma Lee's music is sorely needed, but as she recorded for so many labels over her long career, legal logistics make such a collection a near impossibility."
3,not bad,It's okay.... short but straight to the point. Worth no more or no less than five bucks -__- I get it use.
3,helpful but not great,"The illustrations are just too ""draped"" at times. It is helpful to give you and Idea of how to do the folds ect but sometimes the examples are just too dramatic."
1,Great if You Want to Draw the 50's,"There are a lot better books out there about drawing drapery, even books not about drapery have better draping sections. I was really disappointed and didn't realize the age of this book. Someone drawing retro graphics that have to do with the 50's would find this perfect. Some fundamentals hold true but it's hard to get into. I found better material online."
4,Good value,"I've had this accessory set for over a year now, and never had any problems with it. My phone generally stays in my car and is connected to the charger most of the time, and it still works great. I don't use the earpiece very often, but it has served its purpose well when I have. The case isn't something I need or cared about, anyway. I'd give this item 5 stars if it came with a belt clip instead of the case. Overall, I think it's a very good value."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,You really get what you pay for. This was very cheap in price and quality. It lasted three days before the charger broke and the earpiece was useless from the beginning. Can't say anything about the case. It looked to cheap to be used.
4,camp chef spg-90b,Had a bit of hiccup with the first order as the ignitor failed to work and the flame was not as powerful as described but Amazon was excellent in sending me a replacement immediately. It only took 2 days for the replacement to arrive from the time i filed a return. The replacement works like a charm and the flame now burns very powerfully. I've only used this item for the first time and am loving it. Hope this review helps your purchasing decision.
2,Rust out quickly,"I just bought this grill this year for all summer camping. As everyone else is also saying it starts to rust and decay after just a few months. The burners are great but unfortunately everything else that supports them are rotting away. They also put rubber tightening screws on the top grating to hold it in place and make it easier to remove. Unfortunately they have these rubber screws, similar to those that support the legs. As soon as i started up the grill for the first time the screw melted away. I can't understand that at all."
4,Camp Chef SPG 90-B,Just rec'd our 4th (yes!) Camp Chef. We have been using some sort of Camp Chef for over 10 years. We are using this one at our Camper in Key West. We set up an outside kitchen complete with wind block. The 'oven' is very accurate. The btu's of this unit provide heat comparable to the best professional stoves in the business. Highly recommend.
5,just recieved,"I purchased this stove to replace the one on my pop-up camper, it is nearly twice the cooking surface easily accepts my 3 biggest 14"" pots or pans. Unlike the other reviews I found the flame control to be excellent at low flame even in high winds, it also makes quick work to boil, not really a complaint but i found the legs are too short, but easily upgraded (simply replaced w 3/4 pipe ). The stoves construction is solid heavy steel and product seems built to last forever. The grill box of this combination is as heavy as hell but allows for room to prepare for a gathering of 8 and still leaves a burner for onions peppers and mushrooms. This set up is fantastic. I cant believe I didnt throw out the old stove years ago. for packing up the carrybags are a must. they are well build and allow for the grill to fit right inside, seperate bag needed for the bbq box also indispensable for storage and transport.Happy Camping."
1,Learning tool,"Includes songs for learning multiplication.My favorite song ""Mamita Querida"".""El negro Cirilo""song may not be the favorite for those very sensitive about using the n word."
4,A Wealth of Information!,Julie has worked for several years compiling the information that is in this book. It's a must for anyone that is dealing with someone that has special needs. It's truly a labor of love!
5,Nickelback Video Collection Dvd,Awesome dvd! Arrived in excellent condition and was very fast and so worth it! I am very pleased and would give you ten stars if I could! Thank you!:)
3,More preview than review,1. Rockstar - 4:212. If Everyone Cared - 4:033. Far Away - 3:384. Savin' Me - 3:395. Photograph - 4:196. Figured You Out - 3:507. Feelin' Way Too Damn Good - 3:518. Someday - 3:259. Never Again - 4:2310. Too Bad - 4:0411. How You Remind Me - 3:4712. Leader of Men - 3:31Sometimes you just want to know whats on the dvd.
4,Edited DVD but still great collection,"It is an excellent quality DVD, but I took one star off because the song Never Again was edited on the DVD I got, and I ordered it from Amazon. I have never had a problem with edited videos from Amazon before, so this puzzles me. Even with that said, it's still a fantastic collection of videos from a phenomenal band."
5,A Great DVD,"I bought this at Walmart, but will buy it again from Amazon, because the Walmart version takes out several of the words to ""Never Again"" which is my favorite song of Nickelback's. It is worth buying a second copy!"
3,Censored .......,"I do not buy CDs/DVDs usually but I love Nickleback and wanted the song videos.......just not the CENSORED ones on this DVD I received.... I guess I missed that part.Shame on you Amazon...... it states ""unrated""...."
3,Crash & Burn!,"This was fun to watch! Esp with a couple of cycling friends (girls) as were all going ooooooh,ooooowwww at the same time. Like the coverage on the older races too."
3,mis-teeq,I have heard the song scandalous and I think it is kind of good but it's a rip off of Sisqo's thong song.
4,Good tracks and nice beats. But easy on the POP side....,"I have to admit that this album. Which is sold as an import. It sounds just right sometimes. But I think this album would be a little on that silly bubble-gum popmusic that most teenagers are into. I think they would need to rethink their next album. Most fans nowadays are matured listeners and want matured music. Don't get me wrong, this album is good, I mean GOOD!!!!! But contains too much kids stuff that is way below Mis-Teeq's true potential. If you wanna dance to some good music than this album is for you. But if your matured and like stuff like Hilary Duff's new single ""FLY"" or rock/pop/R&B Artists. Then you may need to hear it first, in case you don't like it. But Eye Candy is seriously as it sounds like. Pop candy or in other words, a more POP feel. But anyway put some hands in the air for MIS-TEEQ again!"
4,Danceable tunes with a difference,"Mis-Teeq has a unique sound that makes them stand out from the rest of the Brit-pop girl groups--a harder edge with just the right amount of dirty. This sound makes the best tracks really move; so much so, you don't even care if the lyrics are silly. The slow songs in the middle are awkward, but it picks up quickly and hits the spot."
2,Save your money,"Makes a great corkscrew. Rated as up to 1500 feet, lucky if it goes 100. No fins = no stability"
3,Enjoyable but some elements implausible,"I enjoyed the other works of Catherine Anderson that I've read and this was no exception. Joe was a mostly believable character with a truly human flaw of temper. Mari's response to her assault was painful but unfortunately accurate. My only complaint is that the solutions to both Mari and Joe's problems were too rushed and too easy. An individual does not overcome the traumas and effects of PTSD in the space of a few weeks. Overall however, I enjoyed the book and loved the interaction between the two lead characters and between Joe and his son. I would recommend this book as long as you can embrace with some credulity, the character's situation."
3,So much for expectations...,"My first Catherine Anderson book was her latest, Phantom Waltz, which I absolutely loved. I was a little disappointed by this book. I expected the heroine to be similar in the latest book, strong and independent. While we see sparks of that in the main character, Marilee, for the most part, she is dependent on Joe to help her out of the problems she is dealing with after being raped 10 years earlier. This is still a good read, but I am always a little turned away from stories when the heroine is made out to be weak in her own opinions and personalities."
2,"Good characters, good idea, slow execution","I have enjoyed all of Catherine Andersen's books up until this one. Even though the characters had conflict within themselves, they had none with each other. This made for a slow - and oftentimes boring - book. I suppose I had a difficult time accepting the heroine's retreat from the world for so long even though she had been profoundly hurt in her past. I think this book could have moved a little faster. All that aside, as always Andersen's characters were inherently good, sweet people learning to triumph over life's difficulties and setbacks. This story just did not click for me like her others."
5,Great book!,"This book brought back some bad memories for me, so it was hard to read at times. It's proof (I'm proof) that women can heal from horrible experiences. If you've ever suffered from PTSD, you'll be able to relate to Marilee. And Joe is such a sweetheart! The characters were so easy to love, especially Boo and Zachary. If you're a rape victim, and have PTSD, you shouldn't read this book...in my opinion."
3,Good Read,Easy read for a lazy day. Love story that made you feel for the main characters. I read it in two days.
2,Disappointing for a Catherine Andersen fan,"I am normally a huge Catherine Andersen fan and I am not overly fussy in my casual reading. However, this story really felt like a waste of time and money. I missed the usual conflict of emotion and felt like I didn't get to fall in love with the couple. Instead we kept hearing about how they had always been in love. I missed ""the fall "" The story dragged and I never felt connected to the lead characters."
5,"Well done, exciting book.","After a bitter divorce and custody battle, pro football player Joe Lakota returned home to the small town of Laurel Creek, Oregon, to start over. The woman he loved all those years, Marilee Nelson, was there waiting for him, but her past caught up with her when Joe proposed marriage. This emotionally charged and poignant book is quite human, with the imperfections making the story and characters all the more real. Marilee copes with an anxiety disorder while Joe does his best to be a single father. Catherine Anderson takes us on a real roller coaster ride, with a thrilling, beautiful result."
2,Seventh Heaven,"I am a big fan of Catherine Anderson's but I was very disappointed in this book. I did like the characters, however the story line was slow, with the author repeating the same thoughts and problems over and over. Also, the characters reactions didn't always fit the situation which was a little confusing. I haven't given up on Catherine Anderson. Hopefully her next book was be better than this one was."
5,great game!!!!!,I like ice age games. I must have them all . The scrat is so cute. Hes the cause of it all.
2,Don't buy it,"Whatever you do, don't buy this game. You have to do the levels under (dun duhan) a time limit. I thought it would be better,honestly."
5,Next best thing to being there...,"Well, if you can't get to Hawaii, or haven't been for some time, this book will take you there. The images Roy TabOra brings forth in his canvases transcend the pages herein and let you experience the wealth of emotions that come from being in a paradise.One of my favorite books."
5,Great Book to Learn about the Artist,"I found this book to be more than informative, but empathetic as well. The artist has had an exciting life with significant milestones along the way. He continued to grow and develop his art and business skills. I visited his gallery in Oahu and wished I had read his book before my visit. I then could have discussed some very important aspects in the development of his art. This book contains nearly all of his work in high quality photo printing. I really appreciate the comprehensiveness of the book. Over the many years I have see Roy Tabora's work in several art galleries in Hawaii and I particularly like what he does with the color of the wind swept waves. This book shows most of his seacape work and now I can compare and contrast how he sees these scenes so differently in so many images. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Roy Tabora's impression of Hawaii seascapes."
3,could be worse,"i bought the rider link 1 year before.my only great complain si about. cell phone cable. it is a (3.5mm 2 ring-3 conector). and moderm cell are (3.5mm or 2.5mm 3ring-4 conector.)the problem with this is you can only hear the phone call but are not able to speak because the cell phone (nokia 5800 xpress music) only recognize as a spearker and not as a handfree.but the way this is a good trick.. i use the nokia as mp3 and gps too. (less device on road.good suguestion is to put all togetter in a tank bags because it has many cables.but. is very good device for the price. comunication betwen passanger. at high spedd. (about 80miles).i think fm radio is uless, and the device could be smaller. and thiner"
1,flimsy,...and cheap. I returned it. I will look for something else.xxxxx xxxxx cxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx cxxxx xxxxx
3,Not all you would expect,"This is the standard Australian text on the identification of eucalypts in the field. The forward forewarns the reader that it is intended for ""expert"" users.The trees it described are set out in ""Natural order"" .For they lay user this book is virtually impenetrable and I suspect they will find it of little use in the field. The trees appear in apparent random order and the key in the introduction , based on location ,is of little use.You will need to be completely familiar with the academic classification of trees to a detailed level for this book to be useful.It is inclined to have the appearance of a dictionary that is not in alphabetic order."
3,Nice Attempt At A Tribute To The Latin Legends,"Nice Attempt At A Tribute To The Latin LegendsThis is an interesting, but limited view.It's good for anyone interested in the Latin Legends - or any boxing fan to watch on a crummy weekend or if you have an hour and a half to kill.The DVD focuses on Kid Gavilan, Carlos Ortiz, Salvador Sanchez, Alexis Arguello, Julio Cesar Chavez and - one of my personal favorites - Roberto ""Hands Of Stone"" Duran.It really is a nice attempt at a tribute - there are some great highlights and bios on these great champs, but it truly falls short.There is just not enough. It seemed incomplete and unfocused. I wanted more clips and highlights and simply - I wanted more complete information. I expected better and expected more.As a whole this is a good DVD - not great, but good."
5,Very touching and memorable,"Great overview of the greatest latin boxers including but not limited to Alexis Arguello, Carlos Ortiz, Roberto Duran, Salvador Sanchez, etc. The recap of fights are great and the memories and advice they give are unforgettable"
2,Could have been better,"This is a great item to have if you're a boxing fan. Unfortunately, it really falls short on the biographies, and also...and very important it's missing some of the greatest latin boxing legends. Figures like Wilfredo Benitez, Wilfredo Gomez,Esteban De Jesus. I guess because this dvd was aimed to Mexicans or somebody else but there were a few Puertorican boxers worth mentioning. All in all, not worth having if you are not Mexican."
4,Moe the Dog in Tropical Paradise,Moe the Dog in Tropical Paradise is a wonderful book. I liked it because Moe uses his imagination to find something to do over the weekend. He pretends to be in a tropical paradise. If you can't go there in real life you can be like Moe and pretend. He shares his great ideas with his friend. I like to share my ideas with friends too.
5,"We love ,,love ,love Moe and Arlene","The adventures of Moe and Arlene at the Frozen Cow factory, the movie theatre and their own homes have entertained my segven year old for three years running. Thanks to Arlene, the term ""fetching"" has been entered into our family's fashion lexicon! A wonderful story about a male and female who are very close, very dear friends who can spend the weekend together simply as dear friends. Bravo Moe! A true gentleman!"
2,Just OK,"I had high hopes of this being a very good concert DVD for my home theater but the audio quality is not very good so the performance suffers. There's no DTS audio, only stereo and Dolby. There could have been a problem with microphone placements or other recording issues, but guitar and keyboard solos are muddy and not loud enough, and the lower frequencies are too hot which causes the overall sound to be muffled. It's a shame since Huey and the band did a great job."
1,Live at 25?? I don't think so!,"Any long time fan of HLN will be extremely disappointed with this DVD or its CD version. First of all a celebration of 25 years should include all original members. This DVD doesn't!! You'll notice the sound of the music is so different to what you were used too. Thanks to Stef Burns replacing Chris Hayes. Talk about average guitar playing! I actually can't bring myself to buy this at all. I've listened to the samples via Amazon. I recommend you do this. Then you will hear the difference. And ""Can anyone really recommend the new 'Do you believe in love'""? Do yourself a favour and remember HLN as they were, try listening to SPORTS again."
2,Missing,"I was disappointed not to hear 60 Minute Man especially since it was advertised with it before the release. After going to at least one live concert each year, it wasn't the same without it."
5,Excellent,"Saw them live in 1988. Yes, many new members, but the same great sound. If you like Huey, I know you'll like this DVD."
3,Helpful,This book provides practical ideas which will help you to communicate with children. The importance of listening to children and understand them.
4,Dash Mount,"Not the easiest to install, but it is a custom fit for my '92 Ford Ranger. Should work well for planned ham radio use."
3,Seems built well,Seems to be machined well and sturdy but not made in USA. I got it cheap to replace a broken wrench.
3,Fuller 507-4902 Ratchet review,"This product is priced right and works well. I haven't had to use a lot of torque yet, however is seems to be plenty bulky and strong."
1,Too difficult a routine,"Either I didn't see it, or there wasn't enough information regarding the level of the coriography of the step routine. I've been doing step aerobics for years now, but this video was WAY too difficult. The routines were just way too complicated to get just by doing it along with her. It would have been nice to have a part at the beginning that taught the steps before she launched into this most difficult routine. The pilates part was good, though."
5,Excellent,As usual Kelly McCann's videos are excellent in separating fiction from reality. The methods that are taught in this video are practical and assuage the fears that many Americans have about terrorism.
1,This book was so not for me,"I got this book so that I could send it to my maid of honor. I'm the first in our group to get married, so none of us really have a good idea of what goes on. Under no circumstances will I actually send it to her though, I really don't like the tone. The word ""obligation"" is used way to often in my opinion. I would be embarassed to give this to someone I consider a friend."
1,I don't understand the good reviews...,"I bought this book based on the reviews, but I found it to be a horrible book. I can't imagine following these rules and having friends after the wedding. What they tell you to do is be one of those annoying people that gets involved in EVERYTHING and takes over EVERYTHING.EVERYTHING wedding related seems to be the responsibility of the Maid of Honor.I'm scared to be a Maid of Honor after reading this book. What the author describes as responsibility of the Maid of Honor seems more appropriate for a Wedding Planner."
2,Too much responsibility!,"This book gives the maid of honor WAY too much responsibility. From contacting and dealing with all the other bridesmaids so the bride can worry about others things to contacting everyone on the guest list to introduce yourself and let them know where the couple is registered. Ha! This book does contain the basics, but it pushes things a bit too far I think."
5,A Must Buy - this was really great,"Anyone who is asked to be a Maid of Honor (or Matron of Honor if you're lucky enough to be married <smile>) should be REQUIRED to read this guide! It was such a huge help.This little book realy was a big help to me. I knew some of the basics of what was expected of me but there was so much more. I think my sister (the bride) was really impressed.I have to confess, I took full credit for the 2 toasts I used from the book (one at the reception and one at the rehearsal dinner). But hey, what they don't know won't hurt them! The toasts in the book were really good and helpful.This really is a great buy! ...It was the most important thing I bought for the wedding."
1,Does not Work,"I ordered one of these to replace a dead battery on a Lifebook p1510d. When it arrived I put it in the lifebook and it would not recognize a battery was plugged in. After a few hours of trying to charge it with no luck I assumed it was DOA and returned it. I received a replacement 1 business day later, and it was a repeat of the first one.Either the product has a high DOA rate or it simply does not work with the lifebook P1510D."
5,Classic Bluegrass Gospel,"While many (myself included) regard J.D. Crowe and the New South's 1975 self-titled album one of the finest progressive bluegrass albums ever made, this collection of bluegrass gospel is an equally impressive album in its own right. While released by Rebel Records in 1978, it was actually recorded for a smaller label some years earlier. The band's lineup at the time featured Larry Rice on mandolin, Bobby Slone on bass and future solo bluegrass star Doyle Lawson on guitar and lead vocals--although Rice handles lead vocal chores on ""Goin' Up"" and Crowe himself does a rare lead vocal on ""Look for Me."" All told, there is not a weak track in the bunch. My only complaint is that the album is barely over thirty minutes. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,best movie soundtracks of 2005,"""Dus Bahaane"" is the quintessential vigorous dance track with all the required zest and pep in the right places. The album only gets better with the next track ""Deedar De"" where Sunidhi Chauhan adeptly ensures her eon for this year too. The fleeting velocity of the album comes to a screeching halt with ""Unse Poonche"" where Udit Narayan and Alka Yagnik get as romantic as they can.Overall, Vishal-Shekhar and Panchhi Jalonvi have created a great album that will have you listening to most of tracks again and again. A definite must for all music lovers and one of the best movie soundtracks of 2005."
3,Oh brother,"These flix give the suffix ""less"" a real workout - tasteless, brainless, worthless, talentless, pointless and so on. Even still, you just can't stop watching them!"
3,a good B Movie package,the price is right . one color movie was good-----all 3 had topless ----one of the 2 black and whites was good and the other was so-so
1,Waste of money,Do not waste your money. Little information provided. There are much better vendor white papers on the web. You can not even read the diagrams. A copier could have done a better job of printing this pamphlet.
1,Better resources available for free,"This ""book"", or rather brochure, is a complete waste of money. There are better resources readily available (for free) on the web or at your local library."
4,Wonderful ideas for decorating my old farmhouse,"This book has great photos and interesting ideas. For the most part, the style is pure country which is just what I wanted for my early 1900's farmhouse. Another important factor for me was to stay basically true to the original house and time period while still enjoying modern conveniences. Discussions of the impact of colored walls on emotions was interesting. Also useful, different methods of dealing with the unique challenges one finds in really old homes, for example making those high ceilinged rooms seem a little cozier.Most of the inspiration found here can be done by an average homeowner without specialized tools. Bartholomew is also pretty budget oriented so her ideas can be accomplished without great expense."
2,Could hardly wait for this book to be released !!,"Kitty Bartholomew's HGTV show, Your Home, was great. It was one of the few I tried not to miss and even taped some of them. I was so excited to purchase this book that I made a notation on my computer calendar when it was going to be released so I would be the first to get it. Well, sorry to say I was disappointed. It was a rehash of her old TV shows. I thought I was going to see something new but no such luck. Nothing updated in the whole book. Wish there would have been newer examples I hadn't seen before. Guess I just didn't carefully read the promo about the contents prior to purchasing."
3,Old information,"The book is okay, but information is somewhat old style. Considering when the book was written, it reflex's that era and should have been expected. Some of the decorating ""rules"" still apply, but don't think you are going to get innovation."
5,This book will teach you to trust your instincts in decorating.,"My passion is decorating my house.It's sort of a mix of Cottage, Country French and Miscellaneous.I have a zillion home decor books and I have always tried to pick up little tricks and emulate someone else's style. But, since I read ""Kitty Bartholomew's Decorating Style ""I have abandoned all inclinations and obligations to copy. Inspired by the book,I do what I like and what looks good to me and it works out well---in my opinion. And my opinion is what counts!!!I don't think Paige Rense will come calling, but I'm happy!!"
5,Kitty once again comes through!,"I have followed Kitty for a number of years and am continuously amazed by her talents and ideas. Though I have not had a chance to read the book cover to cover, am thrilled to have one of her books for reference, as she covers all aspects in need to know decorating."
2,"If this was a USB card, it would get 5 stars","Like the title says, if this was a USB card, I'd give it 5 stars. But since the main reason I bought it was for the Firewire port, it drops down to 2 stars. I got this card so I could capture video from my miniDV camcorder onto my PC, but I was getting so many dropped frames (somewhere in the neighborhood of 75-100 per minute) that the resulting captured video looked like a flip book -- that was missing half the pages.I tried contacting the manufacturer through their website directly, but they never bothered replying to my e-mail.In a nutshell:USB ports get 5 starsFirewire port gets 1 star"
5,Very well written Bio of Bill Wilson,"I am a long time member of AA, and knew quite a bit about Bill Wilson prior to reading this book. But I have found out so much more than I expected to from the book, and it is very well written. I can recommend this highly to anyone wanting to know more about the man who founded one of the most important organizations of the 20th Century.- John T, San Francisco, CA"
5,Superb,Excellent and insightful look at a complex and fascinating visonary who helped changed the culture of the 20th century.
1,dull...,"expected something with a bit more of an edge, perhaps a little emotion. what i got was some elvis costello-esque drivel. the one star is for the fact that they do sound like pretty good musicians, just not my cup of watered down tea."
2,Arty Schmarty...,"My stereo must be missing some crucial component. Having been advised of the required repeated listenings, I have done so for almost a year. I still don't get it. The Aluminum Group may have turned songwriting into a craft, but this was unfortunately done at the expence of art. What was promised as an eclectic breed of melding styles and sounds turns out to be just another unwanted stepchild. There are so few musical standouts here that one is left to mutter vague comparisons. Fountains of Wayne have done this prettier; Teeange Fanclub have certainly done this louder. Kent has done this in Sweedish; Even the Lily's have done practically this same record - song for song. There can be a brainful of fine musical details on a recording, even in one song, but when these details become clouded by muck, there is not much left to love. Perhaps I'll wait another year to re-listen. These are some very good musicians in dire need of some very good music. This one is good, but not very."
1,How about some melodies?,"I purchased this album mainly because of Jim O'Rourke produced it. Everything I own with his name on it is good so I thought ""What do I have to loose""? I read some of the negative reviews on this page, but hey! it can't be that bad, right? Wrong. I simply cannot find ANY melodies (except for a short guest appereance by Sean O'Hagan on track 1, and that banjo part is the only melodic thing on the whole album)! Believe me, I have tried to find good melodies, interesting lyrics, or even good production values but I give up. There is no ""soul"" on 'Pedals' at all. Well, this wasn't my cup of tea so I think I'll stick to 'Eureka' or 'Pet Sounds' or something."
4,q: so whats the bonus track?,"remix of ""paperback"" by john herndon of Tortoise. it's about 7:30 long, does have vocals, isnt exactly a club-stomping type mix, but, almost reminds of THE BLACK DOG and those sorts of minimal drum type/warped vocal effect type mixes. Thumbs up or down? up"
2,"pleasant music but, I agree, the lyrics are pretentious","This is a pleasant enough listen but the music is nothing earth-shattering. I agree with the reviewer below: the lyrics are incredibly pretentious. The reference to Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is laughable and made the group sound like a bunch of English majors eager to show how well-read they are. (Maybe they were being facetious...which would still rate being labeled ""pretentious.)"
4,Will the real pop sensations stand up,"It's a shame that in this Britneyized world, pop music with interesting chord changes and complex layers is the exception, not the rule.Pedels is an album of this kind of depth and quality. Each listen compells you to hear these songs in a new way. There are so many hidden twists and pockets of sound that you come back again and again to try and wrap your mind around what's happening in the music , only to find how much you have missed on previous listens. I've had Pedels for a week, and if this is addiction, who needs detox.Thirty years ago, this music would have been all over the radio. Program directors who think they can only sell deordorant with implant prefab barbies should really sit down and have a listen to this."
3,So pretentious!,"I purchased this CD after hearing the Aluminum Group's ""Plano"", which was BRILLIANT. Sadly, ""Pedals"" was a big disappointment.The one thing that disgusted me the most about this CD was the pretentious lyrics. I do not understand the need to sprinkle intellectual-sounding buzzwords all over the album when it doesn't even make sense in the songs as a whole. What are these people trying to prove by being so artsy-fartsy when they don't even have a clear idea to get across to the listeners? I cannot believe that these lyrics were written by the same group that gave us ""Chocolates"". If this is ""art-rock"", then it is definitely not for me!"
5,best thing theyve done,"this is their most cohesive album and most interesting musically, vocally, and songwriting wise. terrific stuff. the lyrics are not pretentious at all, they are brilliant and clever, as well as beautifully phrased. about as good as pop gets."
1,yukon cutters-12 pack,tool is possibly hazardous because the snap off blades DO NOT lock properly when in use. I was VERY disappointed at the overall quality of the product in general and the hazardous way it functions. Would not recomend at any price.
4,Death : The Perennial Taboo Subject,"Fr. Neuhaus has done us a great favor. He has devoted his considerable talent and energy to writing a book whose subject we would rather deny than meditate on. He has left us with challenging questions which only we can answer for ourselves about that most mysterious and certain occurence - death. He has taught us that meditating on death should change our life - but that is our challenge and our choice. Finally he gives us a preview of how the mind works when one is seriously ill. I hope my mind works like his when my turn comes.When Neuhaus turns his incisive intellect and fine writing style to any subject , serious readers will not be disappointed for what is difficult is made plain with insight and wit."
1,Never got the product,I never received the product and finally cancelled the order with Amazon after several weeks.
4,Great value,"National MFG pulley's are always well made and last. I've built countless projects that have used these of various sizes. The removable pin is nice so you can pull the unit apart and put it on an existing line without threading the end through it. Just pull the cotter pin, remove the shaft pin and drop the pulley out."
3,Seriouly Limits Camera Functions,"Quite a bit of the camera's functionalities are lost when this converter is attached to the camera, with only limited zoom, flash, landscape mode, etc. Of course, navigating the layered menu to switch the lens settings whenever the lens gets attached or detached gets a bit annoying as well."
5,An excellent and highly recommended addition to grade school DVD libraries,"The DVD complement to Crystal Productions' ""Careers in Art"" poster series, Careers in Art is an educational DVD for students that reveals how modern-day professionals work in the visual arts as careers. Experts speak of their jobs as architects, art educators, fashion designers, framers, gallery owners, graphic designers, painters, photographers, publication designers, urban planners and more. A wealth of insights perfect for starting a discussion about planning a budding artist's future, Careers in Art is an excellent and highly recommended addition to grade school DVD libraries. 29 minutes."
1,It is not a book. It is a videotape!,"Though this is listed as a book, it is not a book but a set of videotapes. I have not received them yet but I was under the impression that it was a book since it was listed as a book! Please correct this if it was a mistake."
4,Great knives,"I got these for my boyfriend to replace the set we had. After all of the joking about being able to cut cans, they turned out to be an awesome set of knives. So sharp that I kept cutting myself."
4,Nice for the money,This is a nice looking set for the money. The knives hold up well and cut easily for every day use.
4,Very stylish...,"The were a great attraction in my kitchen. Very sharp and practical, and that's what I was looking for in my kitchen."
2,GREAT PRICE! but after a month they're already starting to rust!,"i just moved into my new place and waited to use them, i was very happy with the deal i got, i switched out the paring knife because its not your typical paring knife, but other than that i was pretty excited to use them...unfortunatley after less than a month they started to rust....my santoku knife to be specific...i will be buying a new set...and have also learned not to do reviews once i receive the item but after a good amount of time has gone by so that im not jumping the gun.."
2,Nowhere near what I expected,"These knives are decent, but no where near as sharp as the famous Ginsu brand would have you believe. They work, but not great. Would not purchase again."
2,Disappointed,"I've ordered more than 100 items from Amazon and I'm sad to say this was my first disappointment. First off-when the item showed up, the shears were missing and required me to contact the reseller. They were quick to respond and ship out the missing item. Then, after having the set for less than a week, I began to notice small rust spots along the base of the cutting portion on two of the knives. I know this isn't the most expensive set on Amazon but didn't expect rust to appear this soon. I'm hoping this set will last at least a few years but I'm not so sure with the experience I've had so far."
5,COOL TOOL FOR THE JIG SAW,"After having my jig saw for a while, I saw the need for a few extra attachments.One of them was a ""rip and circle guide"". The second was this ""plastic shoe cover"". And the third was the ""anti splintering guide"".Of all three above, only the anti splintering guide was a waste.This plastic shoe cover worked nicely. It prevented the ""dirty metal shoe"" of the jig saw from coming in contact with the wood. (I have only used this on wood so far). It slides on nicely, securly snapped in place, and glides the jig saw over my work without marking it.I like it, you'll like it, and the price is right.Get it, you won't regret it.In Christ: Raymond"
3,From the Magma to one Duchess !,"Here in this CD we can listen to some great ""unknown"" waltzes..Starting with Lava-Ströme (that contains a very nice introduction, in spite of some less inspired themes), followed by nice polkas, one can hear the Gross-Fürstin Alexandra-Walzer (that I found really piquant). The nicest tune of this gender (in this CD) is obviously the waltz entitled Die Publicisten. The last tune the waltz Rathausbal-Tänze is not truthly inspired and was eclipsed by Zieher's waltz Wiener Bürger. Less known but lovely is the waltz Patronessen. It belongs to his less sparkling waltzes, that keep the viennese charm in a more romantic and introspective way.As most CD's from the Naxos series, it contains some tunes from the operettas like the Cagliostro-Quadrille and the fast-polka Entweder-oder from ""Cagliostro in Vienna"" and the ""Merry War"", respectively.."
3,"Lovely and well structured. A bit cold, but well told","Fairchild was kind of a lame guy wasn't he? Did I believe it? Hell yes! The entire book seemed very real to me. I am a United States Navy Man stationed in Asia (8 years) and I connected right away with the characters. I felt some of the character generalizations were over done. The whole story was great, but it was told with no passion. Where was the sweat? Where was the gut-renching neausiating fear? Where was the teeth-grinding nostril flaring sex? Why did the affair end so suddenly? None of the relationships were ever fully developed. Frustrating...What a marvelous job weaving the Vietnamese history in with the story. That was smooth and impressive. The whole story seemed well structured and very controlled. Too controlled. Almost like reading an outline.I can't wait to read Taylor's next work. I think if he lets loose a little we are in for a rush."
5,Powerful and moving. A startling perspective on Vietnam.,"Although some may consider this book gay literature, it is much, much more than that. It is also a thoughtful and sensitive examination of our role in Vietnam. Its insights may disturb you, may even make you angry, but you will learn from it. And you will be moved. The ending is absolutely perfect."
4,A rarely seen book of true revelations...,"Hats off to Robert Taylor for an amazingly well-written account of not only gays in the military but also the Vietnamese society, culture and people in realistic terms. This book will surely make many of us cry as it reveals so much of our identity as a people and as a country."
2,Well-intentioned bludgeon,"Robert Taylor's first novel, The Innocent, based on his 1967 experiences with the US Army in Vietnam is a clear if rather late explanation of ""Why the US lost in Vietnam."" The racial sexual politics are unsettlingly stereotypical.Perhaps there were intelligence officers sent out and who delivered the messages inconceivable and therefore rejected to the behind-the-lines brass. It seems all too neat and didactic, especially the lecture from Nanh's mother on the history of the Vietnamese outwaiting conquerors, and the steadily unfolding insight into the narrator's Texas background, official intransigence, and Vietnamese dignity. Those who think a less-leashed military would have won will use the homosexuality to dismiss the argument, and most of those sympathetic to interracial homosexual relationships probably already know why the ARVN lost despite massive US military backup."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"This skin has NO protection for the Ipod screen. Not agreed but I would have a few scrathes on my Ipod on the metal case, rather than the screen itself. It is too tight (small) to get the Ipod into it. I stopped half way, figure I would never get it out again. Also came with 75 [...] free downloads with a trial membership, and it was only 50. I found a great one at the Apple store, but it was $[...] and I will not pay that for a silicone skin for an Ipod. I will keep searching!"
3,"OK, but...","I found this rather hot on my arm, plus it slipped down over my wrist and showed under a jacket sleeve. It's a good place to keep extra cash, especially if you have pounds and euros to keep separate -- there are two zippered pockets. But anything rigid like a credit card will just announce its presence. Maybe I'll use it here while jogging, when security is less of an issue."
3,"ok for cash and ID, *but*","...make sure you have a short car ignition key (if that's what you'll be using it for). My findings after trying one of these on in a local sporting goods store.The problem with all wrist wallets is that unless you have a huge wrist, when you fasten them to your wrist, the wallet contours to your wrist and you don't have much continuous FLAT space to accommodate 3"" car key. The result is not only uncomfortable, unsightly, but also untenable because the pointed end of the key is bound to make a hole in the fabric sooner or later.Now if the wrist wallet is super wide (Amazon doesn't post measurements unfortunately) then you could put your key inside width-wise, following the direction of your forearm instead of length-wise (perpendicular to your forearm).Looks like I'll just have to stick to my less-than-sexy-looking shoe wallet for my runs, sigh..."
4,good product,i like this produce very well. i use it when i ride my bike. the only problem is that i need to wear a sweat band under it because it can get very wet and the money inside can get wet also.
3,Pere Ubu - 'Apocalypse Now' (Thirsty Ear),"Since I've heard a few people here and there rant and rave about Pere Ubu,I thought maybe it'd be good to check the band out for myself.'Apocalypse Now' is a fourteen track disc that was recorded live at a small club,Shuba's in Chicago in front of a VERY enthusiastic crowd that took place on December 7,1991.Tunes that I dug the most were the somewhat humorous ""Spontaneous Simultude"",the well written ""Wine Dark Sparks"",""Worlds In Collision"" and ""Non Alignment Pact"".What makes Pere Ubu so specail?David Thomas's fine vocals,the stellar acoustic guitar playing and their use of a slightly out-of-tune piano.One thing for sure,'Apocalypse Now' SURE has that feel-like-you're-there vibe to it.See for yourself."
4,Nice live set from the pop years,"Taken from what I think they called ""The Kindness of Strangers"" tour in 1991 (it was backed by an anonymous donor), this is a live set of 14 songs; many of them are from the very pop-oriented Worlds In Collision. The sound is adequate; the David Thomas banter shines as usual. I would have liked a few more noisy Pere Ubu tracks, but this is a great reminder that you should never miss a live Ubu show if given the rare opportunity. (PS - I saw the tour's Washington, DC show; Pere Ubu opened up for the terse Pixies and easily stole the show.)"
5,Best cd of 2005,"First of all, I listen to alot of music. I really mean alot of music, and this by far is the best record of 2005. The music is instrumental but what instruments they use I can not tell. Think of it as soundscapes that have a destination. This is unlike anything you have heard before. At times it is a mellow ambient bliss then it transforms into some powerhouse ritual frenzy. It is a crime that is cd has not claimed the world......"
5,Creative and Fabulous Read,"Inspirational, educational and a creative tool. I bought this book and after reading it felt that I could do just about anything if I tried. Great resource for anyone who feels that they have lost their creative or motivational edge. Really fascinating story about art and how the artist does it."
5,Incredible Story of an Incredible Woman,"I recently had the pleasure of meeting the author and her husband. I thought she was inspiring after a short visit over breakfast. But until reading this book, I had only seen the tip of the iceberg! It is amazing that someone who has endured so much can remain so positive and create great works on canvas as well as create great impacts on the lives of others. There is so much inspiration in this book. This will be great for Christmas gifts!"
3,can't go wrong,"Very good book. I don't know anything about C++ but this books presents it in a clear and easy manner. Also, the price was really good compared with the amount of information this book has to give and all examples of codes work with visual basic and borland...However it doesn't provide enough exercises and when you reach the end of a chapter it feels rushed, the exercises they give you is relatively hard. If this doesn t phase you then add one star because the explanations are really clear"
5,Listen and you'll see why these Gents earned some awards,"You can't go wrong with a Country Gentlemen CD. I have them all, and I recommend them all. But there is something about the Waller/Lawson/Emerson/Yates lineup that stands out from all the others. I personally feel that this CD, the ""Calling My Children Home"" and the ""Live in Japan"" CD's capture the Gent's in rare form. Not meaning to take away from Duffy, Adcock, Gaudreau, Gray, Bailey, Allred, Corbett, or any of the other great historic Gents. They are all legends, and as I have said, all Country Gents CD's are recommended, but this CD epitomizes the ""magic"" that IS the Country Gentlemen."
4,Excellent for a first venture into the Bible,"I have used this book with 2 Women's Bible Studies. I find it to be an excellent book for first timers in a Bible Study , as well as women who have read the Bible. The commentary and discussion questions make the stories applicable to a woman's life in 2008."
1,Avoid,"I'm taking a course in statistics as an independent study using this book. It might have been better had I been taking a class with a professor helping me understand the problems, but trying to understand with just this book is next to impossible. The examples skip steps, which I suppose I am just suppose to know, with no explanation or note that there have been operations omitted. This is very confusing. I have been teaching math for 34 years and feel I can follow the flow of a problem, but I teach my students to include everything to make sure their work is understood. Even the examples that are worked out sometimes have little to do with the problems that you are asked to solve. All in all, I feel this book is not well written for someone trying to learn these processes."
1,I Hate This Book,"Like many others, I had an undergraduate statistics class and this book was required. I could've borrowed it from the library, but instead I chose to buy it thinking that the course may need the book. I was wrong and I regret paying for this horrible book. A lot of the problems for practice are so abstract and I hate reading it because they show work within a paragraph which makes things very difficult to read, follow and understand. I had a lot of optional homework given by my instructor from this book, but I always ended up just going over his review sheet instead. I hate this book and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are forced to use it. Errors are unavoidable and they happen, I don't mind them in any textbook. However, the way this book is written and the overall layout of it is very bad. The only use I had for this textbook was the tables in the back."
2,Very unhelpful,"The book is poorly written and ineffective as a main reference for learning introductory probability and statistics. It lacks answers for a large portion of the problems and provides no answers for theoretical problems (problems that can't be answered with just a number).There are parts that are unnecessarily verbose and confusing and sections that are completely glazed over. Nothing is written in a way that caters towards understanding. I suggest checking out the free Harvard videos from iTunes U.The book does cover a decent amount and could be useful as a reference for someone who already understands the concepts covered, but I bet there are more thorough well written books available for that."
1,Don't learn stat from this book,"This man, like Rosen, writes like you already know what he's talking about. I suppose if you were at one point well versed in the subject, and need a referesher, it could be an appropriate reference. For an undergrad student of Math, this book is abhorent.The author abuses 'clearly', 'obviously', and 'intuitively' far too much, and the exercises have a tendancy to reference previous exercises. For example, I just completed an exercise which back referenced a problem, which back referenced a problem, which back referenced an example. I had to use all the fingers on my left hand just to grok the problem statement.There are answers to odd numbered problems in an appendix, but a great number of the odd problems require you to have correct answers from even problems, effectively trebling the time it takes to find an error.In short, if you are a natural born mathematician, try it. If you have to study, avoid it."
1,Statistics doesn't have to be this boring...,"This is absolutely terrible, dry, borderline useless reading. This book is written as if the goal is to put the reader to sleep. I had it assigned for a semester as the required reading, and was of no use to me EVER. I opened it in vain hopes of figuring some things out, but found it to be very unhelpful. With the exception of a couple definitions, I didn't open this book. If a professor assigns it, don't buy it, you're better off Googling and using Wikipedia."
2,NOt a good book for a beginner!,"Not a good book for students either, but a very good one if you need to brush up on something you have been using for a long time. The language is kinda not easy to understand, not enough solved examples to explain."
2,"Not effective, at all","I'm normally the most positive reviewer that you can find on Amazon, and I'm about to sound like a buzz kill, but, I'm sorry; this film is not effective at all. It was edited on a Mac using iMovie, it is extremely jumpy, you cannot understand the interviews, and the interviews that are coherent are interviews with people who probably didn't graduate high school. The transitions are so abrupt and rough, they literally gave me a headache. If this man truly predicted these world events, which I don't necessarily doubt, he needs to spend some money on getting his message out there and getting in touch with a reputable film company."
4,BABY LIKES TO ROCK-IT,"Is that Felicia that likes to rock-it? If it is, she is welcome around here any day, I love to rock-it myself! This is the Primo song on the whole Disc, and Must be played LOUD, LOUD, LOUD! The louder he better, I like to get it so Loud I start seeing police cars driving by, (that way I know ther is protecton in the neighborhood? Hell, makes perfect sense t me, am I mestup or got it on straight?) One night my neighbor, Becky came ober and was beating on my back door, I thought it Felicia for sure and let her in, Wow, what a night! Becky likes to Rock-It too, I found out! If Becky ever reads this review, I'm sure she will tell her side of the story, but believe me, she went home, (eventually), with a huge smile on her face, believe that, brothers and sisters and remember to Plan it LOUD!!! K? (Sorry Beck, I thought it was yur Ole' man that sent you over"")"
2,The discs would get stuck in mid play so I missed portions of the movie set,The content of the product (the movies) were excellent but the getting stuck was very frustrating. I would like the set replaced.
1,Sets Math Education Back a Century,"I have looked at many, many math series, and taught using several, and I have never seen anything worse than Saxon Math. Its sole focus on mixed review, whether or not basic concepts have been mastered, is incredibly frustrating for children--and teachers. The mixed review aspect also means that it can't be modified for the gifted or for other special needs students as well as other series can. I strongly urge people to take a look at SRA or Houghton Mifflin or, really, any other series. Unless your needs are very very specialized, this series is not for you."
1,Cruelty Of The Highest Form,"My school uses these brutal insturments of torture with great glee. It is utter terror to stare, long hour after hour, at those unforgiving pages, sinking slowly and painfully into a vacuam of the utter doom and pain that is Math 6-7. Indeed, the reapetive lessons, the boring structure, and the idoitc ''real world math'' all unite to prouduce a terror of the most hideous form. A 12 year old......at realms of inquiry"
3,Pana'ed to death,"With lots of information and many handsome drawings, this is a good source for knowledge of the Panavision system. Undercutting its strength as a technical manual, however, is the irritating propensity of the author to take every available opportunity to convince us that Panaflexes are the best in the world at EVERYTHING (which any assistant who has spent time with the other systems can tell you is bunk). What's needed here is more grit, less marketing."
3,Good choice for a 2 year old,"This bible is fine. My son just made three, and I think it would have been better for a 2 year old. Generally, the stories are too short to capture any interest in the story itself, but there are flaps to pull up and down, which are good. The index is great. I ask my son which story he wants to hear and he can point it out. I, also, bought the next bible in the series which have the kids act out and and point to things while you read. I think that it is a better choice for my active three year old, but we do continue to read this bible, because he likes the flaps."
3,okay product,"I bought two of these. The first one worked great. The second one did not work at all. Probably just a manufactures defect, but still very annoying."
2,The Woman's Way Throught the 12 Steps,"When I saw this book on Amazon I thought it would be a great supplement for the 12 steps, but I don't think it is. To me it didn't explain anything like the original 12 steps. I didn't agree with many things in it and some of it I just didn't understand."
3,A Woman's Way Through the Twelve Steps,"I have the book and the workbook, on step four in the book. Have only gotten through step 1 in the workbook. I haven't gotten through the whole book. So far I'm enjoying both book and workbook."
5,Great Company to deal with.,"Got great service, fast, efficient. The book was exactly as described and what I wanted"
3,A Womans way through the Twelve steps,"This book with the workbook are helpful, many insites from women of all walks of life. I recomend this to anyone a twelve step program. Gives a better perspective on life apply the principles to all your affairs."
5,A Women's Way Through The Twelve Sreps,It is the best book I have found to help women through 12 Step programs of any kind. I would recommend it to anyone working a 12 Step program.
5,So much more approachable than the Big Book,My biggest problem with AA's Big Book is that it is really centered in the middle classed white male world. This is the book that has taken me through the steps over and over.
5,A Woman's way through the twelve steps,I totally love it..It is a great workbook..very easy to understand..It helps a great deal in my recovery..I would highly recommend this book..
4,Inspiration!,"Sometimes, I feel so alone. This gave me hope and I know I am not alone in becoming a better person."
5,Substance Abuse Counselor,"This was a great read. I am a graduate student, working in a substance abuse setting with women. This book is an easy read and is written well. It incorporates the lessons from the ""big book"" but is tailored to the female perspective and gives a little more variety of interpretations of what the big book talks about."
4,AA recovery,"This is an excellent book! I have recommended to several friends how also love it. Women and relate to this book very easily. It is a bit feminist at times and occassionally critical of the Big Book/Twelve and Twelve, but I have learned to take what I need and leave the rest. I would definitely recommend it, but I can't agree with any negative comments about the Big Book or Twelve and Twelve. They are the foundations of AA."
3,Another biography,"In general, a good book, not a great book. If you have to collect all books about the Apollo and/or space program, than you'll end up buying this no matter what you read about it. If you are not a collector, get it out of the library or borrow it.Gave some background information on the life and times of a flight controller, some of which is not found elsewhere.This is filled with his opinions on others, but what the heck, it is his book.Sy does face considerable challenges in his life and ends up in a much better place than one would have expected.It is a quick read and again, gives some background on the space story from another who lived it."
5,The book and CD put you in Apollo 13 mission control,"If you want to know exactly how it felt to be in mission control during the Apollo 13 mission, this is the book to get. The CD ROM has the actual recording of the mission control audio loop, just before the Apollo 13 explosion, and several hours of recording after. You can hear how fast the controllers summed up the state of the spacecraft, and how they quickly sorted through their narrowing options.Sy provides history as to how he became a flight controller, and how his fellow controllers lived during the Apollo program days.If you want to know what it's like to get to and be inside mission control, and actually hear what the mission control audio loops sounds like, this is a must-get book and CD package."
1,Lets take the fun out of riding,"I bought this book hoping to get some insight into the Big Bend area. I read with enthusiasm and anticipation. After reading the section on Big Bend I developed anxiety about ""Do not ride this in the rain"". 15% grade. Be careful on turns marked with speeds too high. I have been riding for about 10 years and although I am experienced, I am a cautious rider. Well, I just got home last night. I am sorry I spent anytime worrying about grades, rain or speeds. The roads were easy and the scenery beautiful. Dorothy didn't even mention the wonderful rides inside the park. I am so glad we didn't miss that ride. It was just amazing. I appreciate her attempt to provide a biker's guide to texas but I will not read anymore as all she did was skim over the positives and focus on the negatives. This book is off to 1/2 price book store for some other sucker."
3,There's a Bright Side,"This little piece of equipment is what it is. Sure, it has the limitations described above, but users of this particular camera have no other choice in the matter. Additional lenses require this adaptor. Period. The fact is, this camera, for a point-and-shoot, takes great pictures. Add the potential for telephoto or wide angle shots, and you've got the best point-and-shoot you've ever seen.Let's be real here. This is no professional product, and isn't intended to be so. Complaints aren't really in order, unless you're trying to push this little camera to do what is best left up to an SLR, etc. It is what is."
3,"Functional, but not Fantastic","This lens adapter does what it says. It allows the attachment of the lens. But it's somewhat cumbersome to use, and the clear plastic is not exactly a match with the camera. But once attached, it is sturdy and holds well, so for a lens adapter for a digital point and shoot, it's not that bad."
3,The Little Book of Heroin -,It was a very fast read. I enjoyed the book. I did not agree totally with all the information given. I learned very little from the book.
1,Does the author have children?,"I was shocked when I came across the author's pro-heroin web site, and the author's degrees mean nothing. Anyone can go through the educational system and acquire degrees with half a brain, but common sense and heart, you either have them or you don't. Does he have kids/grandkids? What I find extremely suspect is the lack of negative reviews of the book and doubt, because of this, that mine will be/remain posted. This guy's ""book"" is a lot of dangerous nonsense in the hands of any young person wanting to justify the use of this horrifically dangerous, life-wasting drug."
1,Beware! It's a Socialist Perspective!,"A number of the Landmark books are written by people with strong socialist leanings and this is one of them. Marie Antoinette is belittled, mocked, and cannot do anything right.Also to be avoided is the Landmark book ""The Crusades"" which contains outright lies."
3,Declinism,"To say that Spain in the XVII century was in a state of irredeemable decline is a North Atlantic myth. In fact, until the end of the XVIII century Spain was still ruling over the largest Western European overseas Empire."
2,Pretty Average,A Average CD and some what lukewarm CD. It will be on many peoples worst of list but it is interesting because it is what the name of the rapper and the CD cover shows. It is not as bad as you would think but it's not really good.2.5 to 3 Mics
1,alright...W-T-F!!!,"the weakest part of D12 working on a single career. I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW PPL SAYING things like ""this is the best album i have heard for a while"". ight, lyrically bizarres garbage, his delivery is weak. if your saying your pulled in by the provocative lyrics, well go listen to eminem or other members of D12. cuz lyrically this is garbage."
4,Bizarre,"Bizarre has some of weirds lyrics I have ever in D12. Now that he got own album . He will have more crazy lycris in his new album. Big hits are Rockstar,Hip Hop, and Porno (...)it rating 4 out of 5."
3,This Disc is Nuts!,"In flamboyant D12 fashion, Bizarre comes out swinging just the way one would expect. The stand-out tracks on here are by far the offensive ones (and there's quite a few to pick from). Also, make sure you check out his twist on Ice Cube's ""It Was A Good Day"" with his own ""Bad Day"". The only parts that seem to lose me are the songs where he tends to hit on a serious side. I've always liked Bizarre just the way he presented himself on the D12 discs: offensive, outrageous, and tactless! However, I'm sure he felt the need to show listeners he could be sensitive as well. Like other reviewers, I agree the production here is one of the best parts. Check it out if you're a fan of the whole Shady click."
4,Tight Beats Bizarre Skill,"The album actually surprized me. I bought the album fully expecting excellent beats and I was not let down by that. In fact, the beats were better than I had hoped. I did NOT expect Bizarre to have any lyrical difficulty. He doesn't really, but his rhymes are actually pretty tight. It's better lyrically than his previous stuff. Most of it actually makes sense to a degree. His guests are all really excellent and make the album. Recommended."
4,Bizarre name says it all,Bizarres Hannicap Circus is a mixture of really odd lyrics and really great production The songs ratings are1 - good PSA2 - ok intro3 - really funny 7/104 - OK 6/105 - skit6 - really disturbing and preetty good 7/107 - Alrite 6/108 - single really good 10/109 - I liked this one alot 9/1010 - skit11 - not really good at all 4/1012 - it was OK 7/1013 - Horrible 2/1014 - nice remake of good day15 - I thought this one was pretty good 8/1016 - I liked it alot 9/1017 - Really good and a 10/1018 - I liked the chorus and the song is pretty good 9/1019 - Ok song not the best 7/1020 - I definitely give this a 10/10 because the whole crew arrived on this one DETROITDetroit WHUT!City of Boom for life
4,One of the funnesit rap albums you wil ever hear,"I always felt that Bizarre was the best member of D-12. Not because he has a good flow(anything but, acutally), but because he was funny as hell. This album proves that even further. Check out the songs ""Bad Day"", ""I'm In Love Wit' chu"", and ""Hip Hop"". His flow on this album is better than any album I've heard him on, and the production is outstanding, save for the Eminem-produced tracks.Overall, 4 stars."
3,Cover killed it,"When i 1st saw the cover of Bizarres solo album in 2005 it killed the sale. 7 years later i hear a mixtape of Bizarre that was a very good 1 and made me want to grab all his work starting with Hanni cap circus. This is not as good as his new mixtapes but keeps true to his crook lyrics style. DO NOT PLAY if young ears are in proximity to stereo! Bizarre says the grosses things that 99% of people are not thinking of. There are a few good tracks that slow down the beat and fit in with his voice the rest is a little off, but thats his style even if its a little depressing on occasion. Ok but he has better stuff out there and should develop with time."
2,not good,bizarre is a joke as an mc..the only thing that makes the album good is the beats and guest appearances. other than that it's still the same weak lyrics
3,VERY THIN!,"I like the design, it runs a little small and it is very, very thin. My son loves it but he loves anything military, Army....camo! I wish it was of better quality but it will do!Do I recommend??? Well........I gave my opinion, if you don't mind a see-through shirt I guess I do. It just won't last long after several washes but my son loves it."
2,Too small,"I rated this item with only 2 stars because the size was not true medium. My grandson is very thin and I think after this shirt is washed and not dried, it will shrink and he will no longer be able to wear it. I liked the material and color but the size was the major problem."
5,Yummy treat,"Right consistency, Excelent product overall. Tasty, but you have to be a fish lover. Much better quality and consistency than the salmon jerky. I just ordered more."
4,Ahi better than most,"Good texture, good taste on the Ahi tuna. Almost as good as beef jerky.Avoid the salmon jerky. Most of the strips were hard and brittle. Some were so tough they were barely edible...more fit for my dog. Also the salmon was too spicy."
3,A little over seasoned,"I think this product is a little over seasoned and a bit pricey, but the boyfriend likes them, so they won't go to waste at least!"
2,THought it might be good,THis stuff is too salty.. It will hurt you in the long run. If you dont care about your sodium intake then go for it.
2,Dry and hard,"While I thought the concept of Tuna Jerky sounded like a good idea, in reality these fell short. The tuna was extremely hard and dry; all moisture was lost in the curing process and left the tuna tasting more like hard paper. I enjoy the Salmon Jerky, but I will not be ordering the tuna again. From the brittle hard texture to the strange after taste, this tuna was disappointing."
3,"Yeah, it's definitely chewy","But, knowing that, I just bought an eight pack of it anyway. Here's my advice: rip open a package, pour it out on your cutting board and cut it into bite size pieces with your kitchen shears. I find even the toughest pieces manageable after that.Still--the first time I bought it (at a Whole Foods), I happened to get a package that wasn't as tough. So I agree that the quality control could be better. And some pieces seem nicely seasoned while others feel a little like eating leather."
2,Read the description,"The publishers description says it all. If you're looking for specifics on fishing BC rivers, (locations, flies, lodging) this isn't for you - it's mostly stories and recollections"
3,Shipping charge...Ouch!!,"The product itself was fine, but the shipping charges made a $4 item cost $14. Next time I will check before I buy with One-Click shopping."
4,Great lens but,"I bought this to use with my HD-SR12 camcorder. It works great but when you zoom back, it shows/blackens the edges of the video. I just have to remember to not zoom back fully."
3,A nice oportunity to admire Strauss' criativity..,"I have some comments to make the previous review more informative. The piquant waltz Telegrapische Despeschen belongs to the series of works composed by the Strauss family that is devoted to the journalism and communication as well. Its creative introduction is a good picture of the hurry-life of the viennese people during the end of the 50's.. But in my opinion, as an admirer of Strauss' operettas, the Pappacoda-Polka (from ""One Night in Venice"") and the March from the Merry War (Der Lustige Krieg) are nice examples of the Strauss' hability to ""rebuild"" music from his not so sucessful works. I also suggest to the listener to have a look on the full scores of Eine Nacht in Venedig and Der Lustige Krieg.This Naxos serie gives us the oportunity of listening Strauss' early works, in which he was very creative (almost revolutionary..)"
5,Very nice.,"The water is so clean now, no chlorine odor and taste. Cooking, drinking, bathing, watering my organic vegetable garden, all greatly improved upon by this product."
3,So so,"Nice looking functional case, but, I do not like the velcro fastener. From past experience with other brand cases velcro fastening loses it's initial grip. At some point the grip becomes so poor your device may fall out of it."
4,Like childbirth,"This book is hard as all get-out. The content, especially for non-native Spanish speakers, is very difficult. But it undoubtedly helps you get a better grasp of Spanish and its intracacies. I highly recommend the book to anyone truly wanting to learn Spanish. It's not gonna be easy, but it'll be worth it."
5,Book came in great condition,"The book was in good condition and the shipping was fast, unfortunately I didn't need the book for class so I never really opened it, but still good book."
1,Introducción a la lingüistica hispánica,cometi un error y no puedo comarar el libro y deseo cancelar la orden de compra del libro de introduccion linguistica ..att Cira Milano
1,Shipment of Spanish Text Book,"I ordered this textbook for class the week before it was needed and expected that it would arrive within 4-14 business days. I ordered my textbook on January 15th. I didn't get an email saying that it would be shipped until January 21st. And it finally arrived last week. I missed several weeks of homework assignments because the shipping from amazon is so delayed.The point is, if you need to order something from Amazon, you better do it two months beforehand."
3,A PERIOD PIECE,"Keeping in mind the fact that one is reading a period novel, I found this to be a fine example of the genre.The description of the Titan and its fate parallels that of the Titanic to a certain extent, and this brings into the equation, stories of Robertson's psychic abilities, as he is alleged to have had astral help in writing his novels.For those wanting the story to be about the Titanic legend, there will be disappointments, as the ship is not the main focus of the story, but rather a background for the portrayal of one man's struggle to live an honest and fulfilling life.John Rowland is a man who has plumbed the depths and is trying to rebuild his life on principles of honesty and hard work, but his past has caught up with him. The tale is one of triumph against the odds, and the importance of honesty, both to oneself and to others.Altogether a most enjoyable read!"
1,A terrible story about a great story,"Having had a relative on the real RMS Titanic and having had the unique opportunity of meeting the first person off the Titanic, I feel very close to the entire saga of the ill-fated White Star liner. The fact that ""The Wreck of the Titan or Futility"" parallel the true events of the RMS Titanic is the only reason why people now want to read this book. The fact of the matter is that ""Futility"" is more of a short story or novella than a real novel.The writing doesn't begin to compare with that of Ring Lardner. Joseph Conrad, or Jack London. The dialog is stilted and none of the characters are very well fleshed out.At best ""Futility"" is nothing mare than a quaint curiosity."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"This book is written in a very sophmoric text and was really down right boring. With the exception of one or two interviews all the info can be found in any music magazine. I was at times embarrassed for the authors ""attempting"" to interview these ladies. Don't waste money on this one, borrow it or go to the library."
4,Great read for country music fans.,"I received the book last night and read it in one night. This is a great read for fans of country music. It's nice to hear the wives speak out. You learn a whole new side to your favorite stars.Like did you know Jeff Foxworthy attends bible studies regularly. And Kix & Barbara Brooks are a ""normal"" family. No maids & nannies in that household. Also, Alan Jackson's wife tells about the ups & downs of her marriage to THE hottest star in country music.So if you are interested in hearing what the wives think of their husbands success(there's Arch Kelley, Wynonas hubby)get this book."
1,Awful !,A waste of time and money - could not get past the second chapter before totally giving up on this one (I really did give it a shot)....
5,Just what I wanted for my son.,"So glad to find this item. When I talked personally with Husky, they are only producing this item in black and I need the grey. As usual, Amazon.com had this and saved the day for me. Thanks"
4,Good but runs small,"T-shirt made nice, comfy material. My son loves it! It does run a little small though. I bought a small and he is a tall, lean 5 year old and the shirt is snug."
5,Still works...,Been four months now and my stomach has'nt felt this good in thirty years..I used to have to take it everytime i ate but its like it retrained my system and i only need it when i eat a big meal now...best discovery i made in 2012!
4,great for traveling,we travel from time to time and because i had missed placed an expensive bracelet once i thought this would come in handy. it holds my jewelry nicely and i never travel without it. i haven't misplaced in jewelry since my purchase.
2,bad product/bad customer service,"I bought this product new and the mechanical part was broken such that the mobile neither spins nor plays music. I called the company to ask for a replacement, but it was not their ""policy"" to replace that part free of charge, but they were willing to do it for $5. My wife paid over $40 for this product (even then I thought that was too much). This is our first child but our last product from Lambs and Ivy."
2,"Cute, but should run longer.","My son likes this mobile, but the wind up mechanism is way too short! It only runs for a minute or two on a full wind up and then my son gets upset because it shuts off, so I am constantly running back into the nursery to wind it back up. And since we live in a 2 story house with bedrooms located on the second floor, this is completely impractical. My son doesn't spend a lot of time in his crib during the day, but I really would like a better functioning mobile for those times when I need him to be safe and entertained while I do a household chore. It's cute though and matches the bedding set I purchased. However, if it wasn't for the fact that I don't put my son in his bed a lot during the day, I would have returned this item shortly after I used it for the first time. I would have gladly paid a few dollars more and given 5 stars if this ran on batteries instead."
1,Ruined My Crib,"Please do not buy this product. It is terrible. It seems cute from the adult perspective, but it is terrible from the baby's perspective, and once it destroys your crib, you'll be so upset you let this mobile sabotage your furniture.First, the toys are not facing the baby in a way that engages him/her. They face the parent's level.Second, this is a WIND UP mobile, so it stops spinning after about a minute.Third, it ruined my crib, scratching major grooves into it that cannot be repaired.Yes, from outside the crib, it may seem charming, but beware a wolf in sheep's clothing."
3,A mix up?,"The CD was fine, but the DVD had a country code that prevented it from playing in the US region (1) I believe.As it was a gift...I haven't bothered trying to get that corrected and I don't know how to make sure I get one that plays in the US."
4,"WOW, Comes with a DVD at a Great Price","There are a few pop singers that I like & Seal is one of them: a great ballad singer with serious questioning songs in many styles. Somehow I thought this was a 2 CD set of a concert in Paris 2004, but it's a CD & a DVD!!! The CD sound mix is not up to pare with other live CD's because Seal is sometimes too far in the background & some of the instruments are out of balance. The DVD is by far superior in sound with multi choices & the extra bonus of watching Seal in action.A great buy for the price."
4,It was E-Z,"With the forms in this book and the on-line links it gave me for local rules and forms, I filed by myself and saved $1100. I had no problem representing myself in court, because I knew my case, I typed it!"
4,i also saw them live,Hey i also saw them with MxPx. i actually hang out with them at a guitar store before the show and drove behind'm becasue we didnt know how to get there
3,What ever happened to Christopher?,"I have never read this book, but I remember picking it up in a bookstore back in '87. For some reason I have never forgotten about it, and I would like to know what happened to Christopher Rustom."
5,Great introduction to neuroscience,"If you're looking for an introduction to the brain, look no further! This book provides a brief history of neuroscience, to the anatomy of the brain, on to more intricate details. It will not leave you confused or with too many useless details.A great read for philosophers who want to know more about the human condition, a must says Patricia Churchland(not this author) in one of her books.A great read for psychologists who maybe need a refersher - or never learned too much about the anatomy."
2,better books out there,"I have been emersing myself in brain books. I thought I would get one that was a nice basic primer. This was not it. It provided too much ""isn't this interesting?"" little tidbits and not a more comprehensive understanding...gave it away..."
1,Lies and erroneous tradition...,"""Cold"" at Jesus' birth? Not hardly, since He was not born in the winter. C.S. Lewis' writing is more factual than this nonsense. I had a pastor friend who gave me this book 20 years ago. Sadly, he was preaching it as fact."
4,The Archko Volume,"I ordered a used volume of Archko, which I received within the week. (Thank you). I would rate the condition of the book as fair. I got what I paid for. I am a satisfied customer."
1,I have not receive my book,"Hello I buy this book I month ago, the book was sopost to arrived by the 21th of April now is the 1st of May and I have not receie my book. two things or you send the book as soon is possible or my money back.I been waiting a lot for this book...this is not the first time guys are late with my itemsThnaks"
1,Archko Volume is Unfortunately a Hoax,"The supposed discoverer of these ""ancient writings"" was German scholar H.C. Whydaman. Rev. William D. Mahan, who paid to have them retreived (after which they were translated and published in 1886) by curator Father Freelinhusen of the Vatican Library, admitted them to be fake prior to his death. Near unanimous criticism by New Testament scholars that the work is an obvious fake has not deterred many believers. Please see Gordon Stein's book, Encyclopedia of Hoaxes."
1,Fiction presented as Fact,"This could be an entertaining story if it was presented as a work of fiction. Unfortunately it is presented as fact and much of it is copied from other works. For full explanation see: Wikipedia ""The Archko Volume"""
3,Fiction or non fiction?,"The book [[ASIN:1603861661 The Archko Volume or, The Archeological Writings of the Sanhedrim and Talmuds of the Jews] was an enjoyable read. Not realising the work was a fiction, much of the content seemed quite plausible and some of it such as Pilate's Report was even very movIng. However, havIng done a little research, I am disappointed that the work is not identified as fiction. Also the contraversial chapter about Eli & the Maggi's is missing despite the book's claim that this edition is virtually identical to the original edition."
3,Barely passable,"While this book is a step up from Schiller's ""Gambit Opening for White"" it is really quite incomplete and is missing a lot of key lines. The formatting is poor, and there are a lot of typos.This is too bad, because a good book on the Schara gambit (which forms the core of Schiller's repetriore against 1.d4) would be useful to a lot of players. This, however, probably isn't that book.There's enough material in here for you to figure out how to play these defenses, but I, for one, expect more for my money."
3,An interesting introduction...,"This Book brings up some interesting and obscure lines, but the discussion is rather incomplete and not every possibility is adequately planned for."
5,straight hair please!!!!,"i've noticed this product works better on shorter hair. and it works great. on long hair it make dry time faster and if you air dry, you can see a difference but it doesn't just completely straighten your hair. and it does work better with the control freak serum your supposed to use after or during styling! and it smells good! i havent been using it for very long, but i am noticing a difference. i actually bought the product for my boyfriend, because he has wavy, frizzy hair. and all he does is shampoo, condition, and put in a frizz control, he brushes his hair back and it actually dries straight! i was jealous!!!! but i'm not cutting my hair!!!!"
2,Not the Hong Kong I grew up in...,"Do not expect this book to shed any light on the culture and people of Hong Kong...I bought this book because the stories were set in my hometown, despite the fact that I usually do not like short stories. I was quite disappointed mostly because the Chinese people depicted in those stories seem more alien to me than anything else. They were definitely not the everyday Hong Kong people one would meet. I felt that the the writer was still trying to portray Hong Kong as a mysterious place when it is definitely not.The writing is not bad, but the contents and plots left much to be desired."
5,Quality Rod at a an excellent price.,"Ordered the LamiGlas Kenai Travel SPINNING Rod for Alaska Fishing adventures. The rod arrived in a damaged rectangular cross section shipping container. Ideally should have shipped in a triangular cross section mailing tube (much stronger). I ordered the rod for durability, quality, and value. The included rod case saved the rod from damage, but when i opened the case.....it was a CASTING rod; not a spinning rod. Needless to say it went back. It was advertised by Amazon as a spinning rod and the stock number on the invoice matched the stock number on the rod. So we assume the folks at Amazon unfortunately don't know fishing tackle. If Amazon fixes this lack of knowledge on their part, subsequent LamiGlas rods offered for sale on Amazon would be good value. Timely shipping would be augmented by adequate shipping containers."
1,Poor quality construction,These place mats aren't really placements but more like cheap trivets. They are very poor quality and can't be put in the dishwasher due to the material they're constructed of. The lack of a detailed description should have been a clue.
3,Coast Breeze Counter Mats are trivets,"We ordered this item because we thought they were place mats, but they are really trivets."
5,Can you say G-run?,"Recorded with J.D. Crowe on banjo, brother Larry on mandolin, and Bobby Slone on fiddle and bass, this is Tony's first solo album and is a great example of his earlier style. This album is packed with songs that showcase Tony's powerful guitar and great singing. Also included are a number of instrumentals where Tony's terrific leads are matched only by his rock solid rhythym. Killer bulegrass! A must have for any Rice fan. Check out the licks on ""Lonesome Reuben""."
4,Good but......,"This is an excellent combination of games but... None of 'emcome with their manuals, just cd's but you get what you pay forand the price is right. I'm still searching on the internet foronline manuals but not having any luck. These games really needthem but I am managing to get through on my own. Silent Hunteris one of the best sub sims as is IL 2 and Flanker but if yourlooking for a complete game WITH MANUALS, buy the full price ret-ail version."
2,commanders collection,i tried this game and it really stunk flanker 2.5 every time i crashed it froze up don't buy this game trust me.
1,Horrible Chair,"Worst task chair I've ever used. NO lumbar support and very short - or + adjustments. The back at it highest sits about 1 inch above the back of the seat which doesn't allow for back support that is common in a task chair. I wish I hadn't bought it but cannot take back. The ""leather"" is very stiff and ugly. No nearly as nice looking or comfortable as a fabric chair. I simply cannot recommend this chair on any front. Looks bad, not comfortable."
5,Strong Traditional Bluegrass,"I am so glad this classic album is finally out on CD, and I am so excited about the four bonus tracks. JD, Red, and Doyle have one incredible vocal trio, and they are three of the best traditional bluegrass musicians on their instruments in the business. I love Red's lead singing. He had a style that was his own, and it was perfect for these sessions. These guys are all three great band leaders in their own right, and their ensemble epitomizes the power and drive of bluegrass music. Buy a copy. Your bluegrass collection has a big gaping hole in it that this CD fits perfectly in."
5,Great Hudson Valley Regional Cuisine,"Delicious local fare informed and augmented by a haute cuisine sensibility and an experienced artful hand.Also, the original jacket cover painting, Rainbow Dawn, by contemporary Hudson River artist, Kim Do, perfectly reflects the aesthetic of this renown chef."
5,A fine example of the depths of the civil right movement.,Many folks are aware of the larger figures involved in the civil rights movement. This book tells the story of a couple fighting status quo on a much more local level. I gained a much better appreciation of the politics of the south in the 1950's Stephen Howie has done an excellent job telling this story. Had it not been recommended to me I doubt I would have picked it up. I am glad I did!
5,Recommended!,"I'm using this book as a quick refresher.The pace moves quickly and not filled with a lot of unneccesary pages of code.His jokes are usually funny too.I actually have taken several of Jeff's courses at LAVC. I highly recommend him as a classroom instructor and - I'm not saying that just because he gave me an ""A""."
1,Do NOT buy the Kindle version!,"I just finished reading this book on my new Kindle DX. In addition to what has been already said by all the other reviewers (a real beginner-level C not C++ book) the Kindle edition is just full of errors and is completely unusable as a textbook or whatever else.Wrong spacing everywhere, tables amost unreadable, curly braces instead of semicolons ending statemens in all samples etc. Kindle version is completely unreadable (knowing C++ already I was able to filter out the errors), while even the printed version is probably not worth the money.If you want to learn C++, look somewhere else. It should be not that hard to find a better C++ book. This one is a complete disappointment, for me at least. Good luck!"
5,Moving and thought provoking.,"This book moved me. Von Kreisler is a wonderful writer and she presents her ideas in such a balanced manner - with logic and feeling. I think the book positively challenges the reader to consider her thesis: that animals have a rudimentary moral sense, and that our own morality has evolved from it. Once people read this book, they'll never see animals in quite the same way again."
4,Great Stories,"The premise of the book is clearly defined in the title -- it doesn't make a claim to be scientific discovery, rather the book consists of compelling and overwhelming anecdotal evidence to support its assertions. Anyone who has positive, lasting relationships with animals will find these stories fascinating and often moving. If you're looking for science-method accounts of animal behavior, likely as not the word ""Beauty"" will not figure in the title. Otherwise, I was most satisfied by this book."
5,My favorite of Gregory's albums... so far!,I just recently discovered this talented artist and can't stop playing all 5 of his albums. Teeter is definitely my current favorite. It's one of those albums that just keeps getting better for me every time I listen to it.
5,Interesting ideas,"From the father of Communicative Action Theory, this book discusses law and politics, exploring how these two interact in the modern idea of a democracy."
4,"highly interesting, moderately helpful","This three-in-one collection is indeed great value for money, and it provides many valuable points in regard to other human beings. It is quite interesting to read the works of all three theorists as they really open the eye to how much mankind has painted the false image of constant forward evolution - man has been and always will be of the same character. This is perhaps the most valuable lesson of the book. However, McAlpine as Editor has left no hint of how to apply these rules and methods that Sun Tzu, Machievelli and, to a lesser extent, the Editor himself, so delicately developed to modern life. The introduction and its lack of proper juxtapositioning of historical circumstances is the only real setback of the book(s). Otherwise, an interesting - though difficult - read."
2,Not Recommended,"I have the key version of this lock. It is now hanging from my front stairs where it was cut by a bike thief. Not only was this little more than a theif deterrent, but it was always a huge hassle to use. The part where the cable opens and closes had to be perfectly aligned to close. I struggled with it every time.Don't waste your money."
1,Deuce Loosely,"Worst bike lock ever. I dropped $15 on this thing today and am pretty bummed. It didn't come with directions on how to set it, and since there's no website from the company, it seems I'll never learn how. I hope the Bell corporation is putting my cash towards curing cancer or stopping vivisection or something because that's the only way I'm going to feel like I wouldn't be better off putting my money into a blender and making some sort of money milkshake."
5,What I have been looking for,My mother and I both have horrible skin irriations and we have been fighting them for years. We have both had numerios prescriptions and have been under the treatment of a dr. for at least 2 years. We have 2 different conditions. Mine is a dermititis and hers is more of an excema. Someone in Canada gave this product to her. She started using it and within a week her skin problem was gone. For the first time in 3 years she no longer felt itchy. She ran out and bought some for me and sent it from Canada and it has worked miracle on my dermatitis. For the first time in a long time I can wear flip flop sandles and not feel embarrassed when going into my own pool. I cn also attend a public pool without feeling like people are looking at my feet. This product truely is a miracle.
2,Should have been shorter,"This book dragged on and on. There was too much detail about the FBI and not enough on the main characters. I have to admit the ending was good, but I had to skip through a lot of the pages because they were so boring. I got this book for free from the best of the best reader's club, so I didn't waste any money on it. I don't recommend it if you have to pay for it."
2,"Hmmm... It's definitely scary, but short on melody.","This album is very dark and sinister which is what the other reviewers had said. But it was just a little to ambient for my taste as I'm a big Midnight Syndicate fan. Perhaps if they had used a full symphony the melody would have been more listener friendly, but the synthesizer just sounds hollow. Where this album does succeed however, is in atmosphere. It's dark and uncomfortable. There aren't many crescendo's, some of the tracks go from ambient to insane within a single beat of your heart!This album doesn't completely [stink], there were two solid tracks that satisfied my taste."
2,Cheap and Short,"This book was reccommended to me, as a developer that is new to Java and new to Struts. Since it was cheap and short I figured it was worth trying out. In short, the typos in this book are frankly shocking and made it extremely difficult for me to follow. Typos in his example code sections made them simply inoperable without a thorough investigation. The author should invest in a spell checker.I did however learn the basics of what the Struts application is all about and if you are after a more high level explanation, then this might be a cheap way of achieving that. Try following his own examples at your own risk though."
4,"Well organized, needs edited for english","While the english needs some help, I think the point gets across. I would recommend this to any developer trying to begin JAVA Web development. This book is well organized going from basics and working into best practices, as the name depicts."
2,Only for begineers who don't want to do things right,"By the time I got to chapter 4 I had almost given up on the book, it has a large number of mistakes, most of the code doesn't work as its presented. Luckily I have been doing struts for a couple of years and was able to get thru it.This may be an ok quick review but as far as best practices it isn't even close. As a matter of fact it does some things just plain wrong."
3,"Good Intro to struts, nice ""best"" practices... Needs editor!","A slew of spelling, grammar (and English is not my first language!) and code errors that definitely make it harder to understand and less useful.It is a good intro book to struts - maybe its main strength. It also gives some good advice on how to use struts properly.It is NOT the definitive resource."
1,This book has problems!,"I have had a difficult time reading this book because the English and grammar are so poor. It is absolutely distracting!It appears the author knows the material but unfortunately does a poor job presenting it. It is an unfortunate piece of work. Perhaps there could be a second edition of this book that would correct all the language problems.For my money, it would have saved me time had I bought a book twice the size. At least I could have gone through it without becoming disgusted and distracted by the grammar. Thank goodness I only paid $9.96 used; otherwise I would really be disappointed!"
3,"OK Technically, needed an english language review","Content is fine. The usage of the english language is odd throughout the book. Lots of tense mismatches and grammatical errors. Where was the editor? It's not bad enough to prevent comprehension, but it is consistently noticeable."
3,Watch the handles,"The bag itself is great! However, the handle on mine broke after less than two years' use. The handles should be sturdier!"
5,Everyone who votes should see this documentary.,"Extraordinarily well done. Shows interweaving of deregulation, lax enforcement, and corrupting influence of money and lack of disclosure in big banks and markets. Raises very troubling points about payoffs to economists -- whether money, jobs, or board positions -- and lack of disclosure of payments for supposedly objective advcocacy of positions -- with specific examples, resume summaries, and net worth. And how such folks skate back and forth among government, universities, and corporate boards. Highlights are Congressional testimony of Goldman-Sachs officers, interviews of European economists, and interviews of some arrogant, hostile academics. Best aspect: volume of information, images, and impressions in one place of orgins and aftermath of 2008 crash."
5,Inside Job,"Jaw-dropping documentary of the financial mess. Insightful interviews were complete, including notes about how some of them personally benefited - at everyone's expense, worldwide."
5,An excellent documentary,"If you haven't seen this video, and are interested in how our banking system and government have worked together to lead to our current (2011) financial depression, then this is a MUST SEE VIDEO! I recently rented this video and now have purchased my own copy to share with friends. It is amazing! I think every member of congress and our president should watch this and answer questions about the information presented in it. (I'd love to see a national debate format where they answered questions about either their involvement or what they would do to fix the problems. OUTSTANDING VIDEO, The banks got deregulation and look where it got the average worker/consumer. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I cannot say enough good things about this video. Get it, watch it and share it with friends and loved ones!"
5,OUTSTANDING DOCUMENTARY!,"This documentary should be required viewing for all Senators, Congressmen and every voter who is concerned about the direction our country is headed economically. ""Inside Job"" carefully deconstructs the collapse of our financial system and the impact on the economy not just of America, but of the world. More than just a regurgitation of the facts, ""Inside Job"" looks at the conduct of the principal players both in the corporate and political world, and reveals both staggering incompetence and criminal malfeasance. Absolutely a MUST SEE movie!"
5,Inside Job,"Every thinking American needs to watch this documentary. It explains what caused the financial meltdown in very clear and simple terms. It does not favor one political party over the other, but instead shows that both parties involved."
5,"Essential Viewing, but will history teach us anything?","An excellent film that breaks the recent/current financial crisis down into terms commoners (such as ourselves) can clearly understand. Remember that New Order disc, 'Power, Corruption and Lies'? Well, that should be the subtitle of this film. Observing the nearly 30 years of institutional blindness exhibited by Allan Greenspan, plus the unmasked hypocrisy of economic academia and the blinding greed of those from wall street...was far more disturbing than watching any Rob Zombie movie. Much more."
1,Waste of space,"This documentary doesn't go nearly as far enough, if it did it would come to the conclusion that this crash was indeed an inside job and was supposed to happen. We have witnessed the biggest transfer of wealth in modern history. They're laughing at us, all the way to the bank."
5,Excellent insight into the greatest level of greed in American history.,"Excellent movie. All politics aside, as this was well narrated in, both parties were and continue to be culpable in a great heist of wealth, power and influence. Years of robbing this country will catch up and this particular movie will be referred to when we look back on history. History will do, as this movies proves, scrub it all and re-educate us into believing what was done, was done for all the right reasons. A must watch for those that believe government is leading us into the great salvation of tomorrow. Much like their promises, it will be the bottom of the wishing well."
5,Understanding the failure of our financial system,"The average citizen has no idea what is happening ""behind the doors"" of our financial system. We want to blame a certain president, but in reality we need to look at the whole structure of how money has been manipulated. Our economy is collapsing thanks to some skilled personalities mastering devious manipulations of the financial world. ""Inside job"" helps us a great deal to understand the ""mess"" our economy is in."
4,Propaganda from the Left,"Yes, financial people behaved irresponsibly, as in ""driving to endanger,"" and laws that have been relaxed ever since ""Reaganomics"" need to be re-established. But this film is more like propaganda from the left to counter the propaganda from the right and their misuse of the term ""free economy"" than a responsible lesson in what went wrong and how to ensure that it never happens again."
5,"Superb documentary on the greed, excess, and deregulation of Wall Street!","This documentary is a 'must see'. It disturbingly delineates the greed, mismanagement, and hubris of Wall Street (financial industry), and how 'carte blanche' deregulation helped bring about the collapse of some of our largest, once trusted financial behemoths, as well as a large chunk of our middle class who lost great sums of money and their houses. Ever since Reagan took office, there was a huge push to deregulate the financial industry, who eventually did what they wanted by knowingly pushing faulty financial vehicles and investments that were doomed to failure. It is also a documentary about how influential and connected their lobbyists are, who continually (to this date) buy immunity and lawmaking influence in D.C. All in all, a scathing indictment of deregulation and greed, and those who have suffered because of it."
5,"You need to watch ""Inside Job""","""Inside Job"" exposes our financial sector as the greatest gang of thieves in human history. It is well-researched and convincing. All citizens need to see it because the public officials now in charge of financial regulation are implicated in the scandal. Congress and the President should be held accountable in 2012."
3,WTF,"paid to watch the movie in HD. got low quality with major delays. good movie, but amazon seems against me watching it."
4,really scary,Well done but I fear similar scenario will happen again. More scary than Obama 2016 because it's based on what has actually happened and will probably happen again.
5,Great video,A well done documentary. My wife and I saw it first on NetFlix and decided to add itr to our personal collection.
4,Real eye opener,"Unimaginable what big coprorations, people on wall street and politicians will do in the name of greed. No one cares about the little people, middle class and hard workers. All about greed. Why now they are making profits are these corporations not being made to repay the bailout. They are still receiving huge bonuses. Why? Its the rich and the poor. Its a me world. What has happend to our morals."
5,Prepare to be INFURIATED!!!! Terrific documentary - all MUST SEE!,"Every adult should watch this movie...I thought because Matt Damon was involved it would be slanted to the left and biased but he did a completely fair job exposing all the vermin who are making America's important decisions. Watch this and then do something to elect people that will HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WHO LIE CHEAT AND STEAL. I have burned copies of this and gave them out....the more who know, the more watchdogs we'll have."
5,Amazing Movie - Truth is out there...,"Ever wondered what caused the financial crisis?Why was no one punished for the crisis?What was the government's role?This movie does a great job of explaining what happened, why it happened and unfortunately leaves you with the conclusion that it can and will happen again. All the responsible parties were amply rewarded.At the end of the day, it is all about risk/reward. When there is no penalty for taking risks, you will take unnecessary risks."
4,Kinda of a slow movie but definitely should see at least once,This movie is prefect for identifying all of the problems around the collapse of 2008 in the world economy. It is kind of lengthy and the interviews do get a little boring but there is a reason it won the academy for best documentary. Do recommend 10/10
1,Flawed,"This documentary fails to address the root causes of the meltdown. I do not remember hearing one word about the Community Reinvestment Act or the role that government played in providing the environment for the bad actors to do what they do best. Instead, they skipped over the causes and blamed the effects."
1,Inside job DVD,"I live in Australia and ordered the product, received it in good time. Can not watch it though because it is the incorrect region code or something like that. Quite pathetic how can you send something to Australia that can not be viewed??????Careful what you order."
3,"Marx, Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky and Mao are Proud!","This is a Communist hit job on Free Enterprise! It is a perfect example of a ""Useful Idiot"" who narrates a documentary that actually allows Barney Frank talk as if he new about the problem when in fact Barney was part of the problem that created the housing crisis. Barney Frank is on record stating that there was no problem before the fall of 2008. This is all about Regulation is Good and Deregulation is bad. There is so much regulation now that business is fearful of growing. Notice how it is terrible that someone makes more than another. Notice jobs went overseas, however it is not mentioned that regulation and over taxation is the cause. Notice that in the end the ""Useful Idiot"" states that the ones who caused the problem are still in power and that has to change. Change to what? One hundred dollars says the ""Useful Idiots"" who put this together favor more socialism than we already have!"
5,But obviously no one has actually watched this...,"...or there were be Wall Street bankers hanging from lamp-posts, crowds in the streets demanding the imprisonment of the politicians who sold the US away for . It's a sickening look at how greed and malfeasance won the day leaving the country poorer, but certainly no wiser. (I've paused now for a time, and am coming back to this...) What more is there to say? The cliche, if you're not angry (horrified, outraged, etc.) you're just not paying attention. And it's easy to pay attention, just watch this film."
1,Completely Misleading,"This film is created in much of the same way you'd see a Michael Moore conspiracy film is usually made. As soon as I heard Matt Damon's voice I knew this would probably not be as partisan a look at the crisis as it could be. And I was right.Read the book ""Fault Lines"" by someone who was actually IN the film - Rajan (the Indian guy). If you read interviews with him after the release of the film, he's actually outraged at the fact that they edited him to seem like he agreed wholeheartedly with their view. In his book he even states the gov't had more to do with lending to less credit worthy borrowers with the introduction of mandates forcing people to do it than did the Wall Street firms. Of course, none of those facts make the movie since it doesn't play in to their adgenda.If you want to learn about the crisis I'd steer clear of this biased film and read Fault Lines or Too Big to Fail."
2,completely skirts governmetn bakings role in generating bubble,good budget and some funny scenes making execs squirmfannue freddy and fed skirted and role they had in providing all liquid cash that was free money that wall st grabbed and was hungery to loan to anyone to maker 10% + onI mean no fed fannie freddy no buuble.this never even discussedlameblah blah execs evilbut wher ethey get free billion to loan?fed fannie freddy and governementif you give 500B and could loan out at 10%+ would you?if governemtn had no done it the 0 bubbleonly through government finance and meddling in money can u get silly bubble
1,propaganda film with some insights,"When watching this film it is important to keep in mind that it is left wing propaganda. There are some interesting facts but they are not presented in a balanced matter. I suggest reading ""The Big Short"" by Michael Lewis for a interesting and balanced perspective."
1,Hypocrisy,"Another class warfare advancing movie by far left hypocrites. Makers of this documentary are mixing capitalism and criminal activity into one.Question to Matt Damon: Sir, how many millions did you charge for your role in ""Saving Private Ryan"", or Bourne trilogy? Should we regulate how much money you and your fellow entertainers are making?"
5,Expose of a very needed subject,"The title does summarize the content. That does not in any way reduce its value. The documentary systematically goes through educating us about how the financial meltdown happened, and who were the main participants bringing it about. No political party is singled out, but instead individuals are identified. And it will be embarrassing for those named, as it should be, all the way through to our present President. It is well worth seeing."
5,A Must See,"Even though this film generates anger and dismay, it is definitely a must see. I have passed it on to friends who are sharing my anger. I read Michael Lewis' book before seeing the film, so I knew what was coming. I am especially angry with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and would never do business with them. I had asked when the film was coming in to Blockbuster and was told they were not going to stock it (the Seminole, Florida store closed about two weeks later)."
5,Eye Opener Times Two,"""Inside Job""This is a story everyone should know. Most of us suspected these things, but never really knew. A big history lesson on our leaders both republican and democrat, who we thought were protecting us really sold us down the river to help their friends and supporters get rich while the rest of us got less, much less."
5,Should be REQUIRED viewing for all Americans!,"Absolutely MUST-SEE for anyone who is interested in the state of America's economy - and how we got here (and always will). This is it! Easy to understand in the ""technical"" stuff, but more importantly you'll finally understand a lot about our political world. GREAT."
1,leftist lies and propaganda,"what do you get when you cross george soros, barney frank, and matt damon? two hours of propaganda. when discussing the financial crisis, if fannie mae and freddie mac are bit players in your story then you are stacking the cards unfairly, and that's what happened here. there was so much biased garbage that i can't even see straight but george soros shared at least one untruth that i remember. other than that, this is either the gospel for progressives, socialists, and communists, or masochistic porno for right-wingers and the logic-minded."
1,STILL trying to protect Barney Frank of the JackAss Party?,If I could I would give it ZERO stars because it tells you nothing.This isn't a lesson on economics. It's a propaganda film attempting to cover-up the government regulations that caused this mess and twisting it up by showing the symptoms and placing the sole blame on bankers and Wall St. Sure they are partially to blame. But ultimately it was government interference in the free marketplace that is the absolute root cause. It is commonly refered to as the unintended consequences of leftwing Democrat Party policies and thier socialising risk mentality with Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac - quasigovernment agencies with Barney Frank at the helm.For the truth about what transpired you need to read books.I suggest you start here:The Housing Boom and Bust: Revised EditionFor the really BIG picture read and watch TheCommanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy
1,Astonishing pettiness; blaming anyone but We The People,"Yes, let us blame. Indeed, let us blame all administrations for the past 100 years if that relieves us of our (We The People) accountability. After all, we merely keep electing the same people over and over and...No. Never let us blame We The People for our problems. We are experts at blaming others. It is never our responsibility.Indeed, nor does Damon accept any responsibility. How laughable.Seriously, skip this one. Its pettiness is, at times, astonishing."
5,Highly Recommended,I saw this quite awhile ago so I don't remember the details.I do remember it was well-made and very interesting. Highly recommended. I will revise my review if I watch it again.
3,left wanting more,"Worth a viewing. Generally well done and engaging. Does a good job of noting what fell into place to allow the disaster to occur, but did not find the root cause. Something happened when Clinton was president and Gingrich ruled congress, and this does not address that issue."
5,An absolute must see for every human being today,"By far the best, and most objective description of the financial crisis. Very crisp, very moving, very shocking - exposes all market participants for their unethical business practices that have continued for so long, and still continue, destroying the common man. Many accurate and important facts. Fantastic interviews of the crooks!EVERY HUMAN BEING should see this movie, since the affects of this crisis affect ALL of us. Show it to your friends, family, students, co-workers, everyone."
5,mdispensible,"After viewing Inside Job on Netflix, I wanted to own a copy of this eye-opening film.Several aspects of the financial meltdown were covered on NPR , and this film was even more comprehensivein telling how much of the developed world came to be overextended in borrowing and close to bankruptcy..Some of the causes were loosening of regulations of purchasing real estate, e.g., no doc mortgages, use of derivativesand bundling and securitizing mortgages, credit default swaps ( many buyers of insurance for the same entity),etc.Credit rating agencies ignored warning signs and rated worthless paper AAA, Whistle blowers were derided athearings. Some professors of economics at prestigious colleges weren't careful enough in assessing a nation's economic health, so it seems.This is one of the most gripping stories in my lifetime. Too bad it came at almost everyone's expense.View this, share this, speak up about this. You must know this!"
5,Wake Up Call - Everyone should see this,I got this for a gift for a friend who couln't really understand how our economy got to be so bad and was struggling financially from the impacts. It is a definite eye opener very well narrated.
5,"Hard work, very insightful, one of the top buys of my life!","A documentary that pushed political sway aside and pointed out the involvement of financial bigwigs, academia, and politicians in the greatest global scam yet. I thought the production was very impressive and provocative."
5,A Must See,"This was a great movie. It gives a great view of the big picture. I do not know a lot about the finance industry, this movie broke down the financial crisis in a way that anybody can understand. It is just insane how these guys got to get rich at the expense of the entire country. Not to mention bringing down other countries financial systems in the process. Just blows my mind. You must see this movie."
3,interesting but shallow and political,"The movie does good job of highlighting the follies and crass misjudgements of major players in the financial world - the greed, the self-interest, the unwillingness to sense danger.. what I found lacking is an insight into what actually happened. There is no elucidation of the financial instruments that caused the havoc, nor is there an explanation (other than greed) of why different players may have behaved the way they did. Anyone who knows finance will learn little from this film, anyone who does not, will go away feeling the world is a dangerous place run by greedy ogres (which it may be, of course..!). But it will not leave you wiser or better-informed."
4,It was good but missed one thing,"Good documentary. It only missed one thing. If it touched on this one thing I don't think people would like this show as much. The one thing is it does not take into account that to many people out there looking for the American Dream (owning a home)should not have taken on big mortgages especially with adjustable rates that they could not afford. If they did a little math a 3rd. grader could do they could have seen tough times ahead. We can not bail out anyone every again, especially our ponzi scheme banking system. That is what a free-market is all about, sink or swim."
2,More Hollywood Nonsense,"If your idea of quality interviewees is George Soros, Barney Frank, and Henry Waxman, extreme leftists all, and Client Number Nine, then you will LOVE this movie.If you believe that Franklain Raines and Jamie Gorelick, who made millions as officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack, had nothing to do with the mess, you will love this.If you think that Barnie Frank and Christopher Dodd did not benefit personally from the derivitives sales, this movie is for you.If you think feckless Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had nothing to do with shoving the Community Reinvestment Act down the lending industries throats, you will love this movie.If you think ""PREDATORY LENDERS"" are so stupid as to lend to people who absolutely cannot pay back the loan, you will love this movie.If you are the type who enjoys a sophomoric explanation of a complex subject, this movie is a must see."
2,Inside job,We ended up watching it on a computer because it wouldnt play on our DVD player. Good show but disappointing that we couldn't view it on big screen. Frightening content - I had no idea Wall St was so corrupt!
3,inside job,good movies was very interesting but i would be nice if you could heare about these things before they happened
1,OK,"I bought this based on the reviews I read. I am not impressed with this product. The only way it circulates air is if the fan mounted below the seat is held out horizontal to the floor. As this is impossible to achieve while driving, it doesn't really do what it is supposed to. Also, at the highest setting, the fan is very loud."
1,Does not circulate air well.,"The fan in the bottom is not able to blow the air all the way through the seat. Therefore, it does not work."
2,Not a great deal,This product isn't a great deal. It works just ok as it barely keeps my back from being sweaty on those long rides. One of the elastic straps broke the same day that I first used it. I feel like I got ripped off but return shipping would have cost almost as much as the product in the first place so I didn't bother. Going to sell it at a garage sale -M
1,Wagan Universal-Fit Air Circulating Ventilated Seat Cushion,"Purchased as new, the cushion arrived ok and on time. The cushion has three straps to hold it securely to the car seat. Within 1 days use one strap separated from the cushion. Three days later the second strap broke, leaving only the strap that wraps around the head rest still attached. This occurred despite careful getting in and out of the car. Made in China so what do you expect. I just hope the little motor that generates the fan keeps working for at least a year. It was not returned. It is easier to re-sew rather than do the return.MartinSanta Rosa, California"
1,dont buy,"this product is poorly made. the first time i attached it to the seats, the straps ripped off. i have to return it. also, it is pretty bulky. if you have short legs, the fan will hit your legs causing it not to work well. i read all of the positive reviews and thought this was going to be a great product. I am very disappointed with it."
3,Ventilated Seat Cushion,"I had leather seats and live in Arizona. It cooled my legs OK, but really did not push any air up my back. Also, the cushion was fairly hard and not comfortable to sit on for long drives."
2,Bulky & Straps too short,"The product works OK, but the straps were way too short to fit around the driver's seat, so I had to use unsightly bungee cords. These did not hold the seat securely, so it sometimes slid while I was driving which is not safe. I stopped using the product. However, it does provide nice airflow and is not very noisy."
1,Not worth the time to even order,"I just moved to the Phoenix area and thought this would be a great cushion to have while driving in the hot weather.WRONGThe fan does not push the air into the seat area and in no way reaches the back area.Is it a good idea - yes, but it does not work. I purchased a beaded seat and back cushion and am happy.The vendor I purchased the ""Wagan Fit Air""cushion from though was excellent. DataVision went the extra mile in the purchase and return. Timely and courteous."
3,Worth the money,"My straps broke just like everyone else but it didn't matter... still worth the money. I don't get a wet shirt anymore. My only criticism is how stiff this product is. It feels like corrugated plastic with a thin layer of mesh cloth on it. I'm sure the more expensive or water-cooled versions are softer or conform to your seat better but like I said, this is worth the lower cost."
3,"Good, but could have been better","I grew up with American Bandstand and I am nostalgic. This oversized tribute to one of the few shows geared to youn people in the 1950s and 1960s could have been better. There is a lot of non-musical history. Page after page of text covering topics found in any high school history textbook. A book of this kind should have many more illustrations and more popular music coverage. One of my degrees is in history and I certainly don't need to be educated about VietNam, civil rights, the communist scare of the 1950s, Kennedy's assasination, etc. The audience for this book is not a group of children. I believe the author used the historical information as filler. Surprisingly, there are more pictures of AB regulars than musical guests. If you loved the show and can get a good price, surely you should read this book. But it left me yearning for more of nostalgic musical trip than it delivered."
4,American Bandstand,"This book has great information about ""American Bandstand"" as well as terrific pictures. However, there are parts of the book where I believe the authors got some facts mixed up, but other than that, it's a great book."
2,Kindle fails,"The Kindle version was very poor. I don't know how this was scanned, but the font was difficult to read at any size; dictionary look-ups were unreliable because of the way they parsed the words.For the most part I like the Kindle, but the rendering of this book was very poor.Some disclosure of the quality and or type of rendering of a book would be useful."
2,Mediocre,"This book says nothing about envy that hasn't been said before (and in fact, all its interesting ideas HAVE been said before, by other more incisive thinkers, and are quoted here). The author's humorous tone falls flat, and he notes several times that he rarely suffers serious envy and has never known anyone else who has either. I have to wonder why the editors chose a spongy, privileged academic to consider a spicy topic like this. A tortured neurotic would have produced a much more entertaining and enlightening book."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"Used this book for a Ordinary Differential Equations class (ODEs - grad level).Terrible terrible book... Author doesnt explain, and leaves everything murky.Oh, you also realize that following the author's organization and naming of sections/theorems/exercises becomes harder than ODEs itself.I have never seen such a horrible book before... I have no idea why my professor chose it, or why ANY professor would choose it."
1,Sweet Jesus this book is terrible!,"To begin my graduate level Advanced Differential Equations course, the professor introduced this text as ""The Yellow Book of Death."" Quite an accurate description. The consenus around the Math department is that it is a horrible book. The text is very unclear at many steps, and leaves out other key steps. I rarely, if ever, use this text to study for Differential Equations, as the notes given by the professor are much clearer. Being that this book is never used, it is nothing more than a yellow eyesore on my bookshelf. Today, I am to take the comprehensive exam for my Master's in Mathematics and this text has not been of any use in preparation for the exam. Upon the conclusion of this exam, I fully intend to take this book out to a field and shoot it. I am going to end this source of anger and frustration with a 9mm bullet."
3,If you've read Inshore Fly Fishing you've read this book.,"I really expected a LOT more information about specifically targeting this species on the Northeast coast. What I got was a minor expansion of Inshore Fly Fishing. I was hoping for insights such as ""how to mimic illegal baitfishing techinques that utilize undersized lobsters, flounders and blackfish""."
1,Terrible,"I bought this iron to replace a previous Sunbeam model from Costco. I loved it and it lasted 5 years. It was light with plenty of steam and glided across the fabric like butta. This incarnation is heavy, provides hardly any steam and would not glide but actually stuck to the fabric. I looked underneath and the non-stick surface was pitted. The retractable cord seems like feature that will malfuntion in a year. It seems like it was made on the cheap.This is not worth your time or money. I'm getting a refund for this monstrosity at a loss."
1,Not my old Sunbeam!,"I've been ironing clothes for almost 50 years and have never been so frustrated with an iron! I replaced a broken 1996 Sunbeam steam iron with this updated one three months ago. It has never worked right! The temperature dial moves too easily, the bottom plate sticks to clothes, and the constant steam and the steam jet have never worked correctly. Although it is lighter than the Black and Decker Digital Advantage D2030 we just bought to replace this one, the Black and Decker works like I expect an iron to work. Don't waste your money on this iron."
2,Steamless Iron,"I've used this product daily for a couple of weeks now and while I have not had some of the problems other report, it is far from perfect. My biggest gripe is that the iron produces no steam unless you push the steam button. Of course, you can't continuously press the steam button so mine is being returned to the store."
4,Steam iron.,"Like this steam iron, great steam and removes set wrinkles. Much better than a more expensive iron I had. Sort of heavy and takes some getting use to."
3,Easy glide?,"Like others who have posted here, I bought this iron to replace a Rowenta that was giving me problems (no steam, dripping, spitting, etc.). I've only used it a couple of times and yes, the top controls are great, there is lots of steam and no dripping. But it is not what I would call easy glide. There is a roughness or tackiness to the glide that I do not like."
1,Waste of Money,"From day 1 this iron took forever to heat up. On top of that, the boast of 'no drip' was completely untrue. It drips, drips, drips and sometimes the steam works and sometimes not. If you're into self abuse, buy it. If not, get any other."
2,Hard to Start,"Very hard to start. Once started, edges well. One diagram in the Operator's Manual shows a bracket for lowering a wheel for edging along a curb; call to mfr advised this model does not have that device."
4,"Excellent read, lots of bulk, but packed with idioms and witty humor","This is THE set if you want to study Magick (which stems from meditation, yoga, using one's will). It helps the student a lot, especially in volumes 5 and 8 where he teaches Gematria and gives out lengthy examples as oppossed to 777. Definetely the longest read he has made, the 10 volume 1992 Weiser set is the one to look for. I had the 2 book set, and the spine of the book was unstable, and it just wasn't the same. With this, the text is nice and big, so it makes it so much easier on the eyes (which already hurt from meditating LOL). Watch out for the 1992 edition, only 750 of them were made and they are now precious jewelstones in the modern Magickians' life of study.93 93/93Frater 227"
2,The Equinox Vol. VII No. 1,"The Equinox Vol. VII, No. 1: Not very interesting, nor worthy to follow in the series of the Equinox Vol. I, Vol. III. Vol. IV, or even Motta's Vol. V. Contains nothing new by Crowley, and is of little use, or interest to anyone. Completely spurious and unauthorized. Avoid. Avoid. A waste of your time and money."
2,Go to ULTA,"I was really excited to get this kit. I've been using the foundation for a while, but I never got the chisel brush, or the other powders. What a waste of money. I am so disappointed. The makeup in this kit is in miniature tins, so you barely get ANY makeup. For the same price, you can get a full sized compact at Ulta. Also, my chisel brush (which is the real reason I bought the package) was destroyed. It came out of the very loose packaging, and now the bristles are practically useless.Essentially, I am going to Ulta this weekend to purchase my makeup. I wish I had done that in the first place."
1,make a itchy,"well i really dont like this product, i did using a week, my skin was itching soo bad, if people looking mineral make up, i will get bare minerals the best ever product!!!"
2,Unsure,"I have to be honest. I bought in to all the hype of mineral make-ups. My sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like I do. I didn't want to pay the price or join the club so I tried Pur MInerals. I still had to use a ""cover-up"" under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the ""flawless"" look. But then it looked too powdery. I started using my regular cover-girl foundation and powder again as I felt it covered better and less heavy. Just a note, my sister said she still uses a ""Cover up stick"" when using bare essentials too, but she looked beautiful in it."
5,Awesome Drift Viveo!,"The Drift Bible is a very ecucational video for people that are serious about learning this new sport. And let's face it; it was a blast to watch!The only negative feedback is that you don't want the video to end!This vidoe comes with high recommendation!Regards,Amazon Loyalist"
4,gets right to the point!,i bought this dvd a month ago and i think its a good video if you have never drifted like i have. it explains everything in detail. it is one of those instructional video where you watch it and then go out and practice and then come back and watch it again to critique what you are doing. for the price its very worth it because i paid close to 40 dollars for mine!
5,Great video,"I love this video, I am an experienced drifter who is so glad this sport/art form has finally come to american shores. This DVD will show you all you need to know, but trust me you will go through many tires and cars before getting to the smoothness of Mr. Tsuchiya. He goes over every technique imaginable for controlled sliding, and it is a must for anybody interested in this fast growing sport."
4,Good Enough,Great video! Well put together w/ good footage and reasonable dubbing.NTSE!!! Will not work in US DVD Players!!!Still worth every penny. I'm having a blast.
3,Singer Songwriter= great. Rest of band= lousy,"The singing and songwriting are great. Very unique without consciously trying to be ""different"". A genuine unique voice. However!!, this ""band"" is not even passable. They sound as (in) competent as kidswhen they are first learning their instruments at say 12 -13 years old. Truly, it is unfortunate, the songs are great and I believe this band could be succesful, but the bass licks and drumming in particular are atrocious. mot even in time , there is simply no coherence or ""pop"" when they need it. no consistency. they sound like they just picked up instruments to be in a band. sad for a very promising lead singer/songwriter..get a REAL band!!"
4,Great Newgrass Album,"This would be worth the money just for the first cut, Last Train from Poor Valley, a great Norman Blake song. The harmonies on that song are so beautiful you'll think you're in heaven. Lots of other great stuff too, such as Paradise, and Small Exception of Me. And Hello, Mary Lou sounds great in a bluegrass context.This is a great cd to introduce someone to bluegrass/newgrass. Also recommended is Live at the Cellar Door."
4,If only it played like it looked,"I just traded up this guitar on a Taylor , don't get me wrong , it is a beautiful looking guitar and the Koa wood really sets it off and plugged in this guitar is plugged in it can compete with guitars that cost twice the pricesadly when unplugged us when thing fall apart , the strings seemd to snap rather than strum and I just didn't like the sound of the plastic back when unplugged , although I have to say it is a beautiful guitar for fingerpickingMy point is I paid about 750 for this and for 750 you could buy a cheap Martin sans electronics or a low end acoustic Taylor that would blow this guitar out of the waterI am a firm beliver that you cannot make a good low end guitar with a plastic back , wood is the way to go in my humble opinion now if I played a 3000 dollar Ovation I am sure I would change my mind , but at this price I stand by what I said"
4,great replacements,"I use these on my Westone UM2's. I like them better than stock cosmetically (The gray earbuds yellow over time). These seem to fit a little better due to their composition, good inexpensive alternative."
2,Over rated ear plugs,"It might just be me, but I had a terrible time trying to get these to fit in my ears. They just wouldn't fit. I got the medium size to be safe and they seemed too large I guess but I am wearing the medium stock flanges for my IEM's and they work tons better. I was told to try these out but I just do not like them. The tool that comes with it might be worth 10 dollars alone I'm not sure, it's use to clean out the IEM's. But as for the earbuds, I suggest trying something else instead."
5,Fit Perfect,Shure makes some of the best headphone products. These are no different. They last long and fit right. Esepecially if you listen to the Jonas brothers. I think I hit my 20 words now....
3,Not accessible or easy listening,"I am fascinated with the music made by Dave Holland and his mates. I kick myself that I couldn't go to the Iowa City Jazz Festival when Dave played there. This music is a challenge to listen to and get into, but I persevere !!! I admire Dave Holland for making music with a bass viola."
3,Mixed review for earrings,"The transaction was quick and the earring were delivered very quickly. However, I was disappointed with the product because I had ordered sapphire blue earrings and the earrings I got were in fact a much lighter blue color that look like aquamarine. The picture is deceiving and the earrings I received are not the color they look. I bought the earrings specifically for the color to match a necklace I have and so it was a big disappointment. However, this is my only complaint and everything else was fine."
5,The quintessential Seldom Scene,"This album to me really sums up all that was great about the original Seldom Scene. This is not to say that later and current Scene rosters aren't great - they are (and I especially recommend that you check out the latest group with Dudley Connell et al!), but this album has that archetypal Seldom Scene ambiance to it. The classic vocal co-minglings of John Starling and John Duffey are, I believe, some of the great moments in bluegrass music. And Mike Auldridge provides an atmosphere of emotion and excitement with his resonator guitar. All together, the music of the Scene is a sum far greater than its parts. I recommend this album highly. If it's your first Seldom Scene album, I promise you'll be hooked."
3,Cassel's Dutch Dictionary,"The advantage of this dictionary is that it contains many words. Nevertheless I find that the quality of the translation of quite a few words is not precise enough. Frequently a translation appears unsatisfactory. It is also strange that the Dutch-English and English-Dutch translaltions are not always symmetric. For example, you may not find a certain translation of a Dutch word. But when you finally learn the translation in some other way, you may find that this Dutch word is indeed given as the translation of the English word that you have found on your own."
4,The murder of Lincoln and twelve funerals.,"This is a nice picture book of the last days of Abe Lincoln. It starts with his visiting the captured Confederate capital of Richmond, and then his murder in Ford's Theater. This book covers the snaring of the conspirators along with their military trial. Then it takes a look at the twelve cities where there were funerals in. Few people realize Lincoln's funeral was the precursor to Memorial Day. Unlike other picture books, this has a lot of information in it. This is a lengthy read at 300 + pages.The authors spent a lot of time securing the rights to the many pictures that accompany this book. This is a very informative read. It also depicts the emotion of the time when Lincoln was murdered. Abe may not have been liked when he was alive, but he became a saint when he was dead.A very informative pictorial read."
5,An excellent book!,"The pictures and illustrations are the best and most comprehensive of any book on Lincoln I have read. The narrative is accurate and well-written. I bought four copies of this book when it was first published and gave them to friends, so I am delighted to be able to buy good copies now for my family members. Thanks!"
4,Fine Guide,"While not comprehensive, there is a fair amount of information. It was unavailable for far too long and not sure if prices are still relevant."
5,Fun book with great story. Our daughter's favorite!,This book has a great rhythm and fun storyline. It is simple and repetitious. Would strongly recommend.
3,Not my favorite,"I really, really love this team of author and illustrator but unfortunately I didn't love this book. I have almost all of the books that Julia Donaldson/Axel Scheffler have written and this one is my least favorite. It's a cute enough book and story and the illustrations are nice, but it doesn't compare to their others. I think she has a great rhyming ability and all of her books are great read-alouds because of it, but this one only rhymes in certain places which makes it a little awkward to read."
4,Nice lessons in Spiffiest Giant in Town,"This is a lovely story and my 3.5 yr old son found lots of humor here.While it still doesn't compare to our fave (Gruffalo's Child)I'm happy with this purchase.I like the idea of sharing what we have with those in need, the thank you note is a nice touch at the end because it supports manners and the practice of writing thank you notes, so we're happy with it."
3,"Fine, but not as good other Julia Donaldson books I've read to my kids","If the Gruffalo is one of my favorite books to read to my kids...And The Gruffalo's Child is a tick lower than that...And Room on the Broom is not quite as much fun as The Gruffalo's Child... then I have to say that ""The Spiffiest Giant in Town"" is a notch lower than all of them.It's a simple little morality tale, well illustrated, but it doesn't have the wordplay and wit of the Gruffalo books."
5,A good start,"Ergo Proxy is a great new anime it has some of the best animation I have ever seen and a very good start to a storyline. Its kind of confusing at first with all the cover-ups going on but the unique characters drive the show. I wish there was more stunning action and a little less talking. But it does remind me a little of Ghost in the Shell, its not quite as good but with the animation and story it certainly could be."
3,UuMmM...,"I actually bought Ergo Proxy for my younger sister, she's crazy about it, but to me i don't find it that amusing, it's kind of boring except the girl is pretty hehe :)ThanksMaiss Marafie"
4,Great bluegrass Christmas album!,"I have had this album on vinyl for many years and was excited to see that it is now available on CD. The album offers a nice variety of artists, and a nice mix of traditional and more eclectic material. Even the traditional material receives unique bluegrass treatments."
4,A field day for both sides of the debate,"Prolifer and prochoicer alike will find this book informative. The authors hold nothing back as they describe methods many women have used -- and will use again -- to obtain abortions, including [...] and filing false reports for rape. Prochoicers will find many ideas and resources, and prolifers will find political ammunition. A must read for anybody interested in understanding the mindset of the prochoice movement in the United States."
2,Good case until the latches cracked.,"I had this case for about 2 years and until this point I would have rated it at 5 stars. Then individually, each latch developed hairline cracks and eventually snapped off rendering the entire case unusable. I thought Samsonite products were developed better."
5,Super nice!!,I purchased this for my husband 2 years ago to put his laptop when he travel. He liked it a lot. I just wish it's a little wider though. Also it is not sturdy when you put it on a carpeted floor. The thing about this is that your laptop is pretty secure when you put it inside. It has straps and pockets to put your battery etc. inside. One of the best purchased I made on amazon.
5,Great Buy in an Attache,"I purchased this for a laptop computer and it works perfectly. My computer fits nice and snug and I have ample room for accessories. Also, by it being made of aluminum, I'm not worried that the contents of the case will be crushed. It also has a nice set of double combination locks."
2,Bandit's Moon,I think Bandit's Moon is a pretty good book. My Favorite part of the book is when O.O. Mary comes to town to kill Joaquin but the sheriff shot O.O. Mary's husband because he shot Joaquin in the shoulder and alomost killed him. I think you should read this very interesting book.
1,Bad Bootleg with poor subtitles and a grainy picture,"I'm very disappointed with this release from Bonzai Media. The picture is grainy and fuzzy with lots of compression artifacts and poor detail and contrast in the shadows. Also, the subtitles not timed correctly. It totally ruined the movie, which otherwise looked very good, similar to Ong Bak. It was so distracting I just stopped watching it."
2,Interesting content; poor delivery,"Whew! Try reading one of O'Toole's run-on, rambling sentences aloud! Great picture collection; but editor was asleep at the wheel. The drama would flow much more smoothly and the prose be far more digestible if O'Toole would decrease his convoluted sentence length by an average of two-thirds. His writing style does not leave one with the impression that he has taken many writing seminars; (from what literary institution does he hail! ) Whereas a skilled writer draws one into his prose, a clumsy one deters his reader."
2,Only interesting to survivors,"This book was totally uninteresting to anyone trying to learn anything factual about the tornado. Personal accounts are interesting, but there are too many of them. This book is for you if you are a survivor of the tornado and can't remember anything about it. My mother and grandmother are survivors and both found it lacking."
2,Picture Quality Poor on Blu-ray,"Simply a great story but, the picture quality is poor. Many specks and minor scratches can be seen throughout this feature. Do not pay the extra cost for the blu-ray format you will be disappointed."
4,After the more recent movie with Oldman - interesting but quite unnecessary.,"It's definitely worth going back to check out the original, well reviewed series, but it now only stands as a companion piece to the newly realised movie - which is exceptional."
1,Extremely disappointing CD,"This was not adequately advertised. I got it home and found that it would not play in the western hemisphere. When I attempted to return it, it was too complicated and not worth the trouble. I tossed it in the next Goodwill box. You really do need to explain that there is a difference in what will play where in the world.Hope you'll get this clarified! Really ruined my day!"
5,Hard-hittin' bluegrass from deep in the heart of Kansas,"Split Lip Rayfield shares members with Scroat Belly ~ another Kansas favorite. We ain't talking about your standard bluegrass here, though. They say that if you curled up all the corners of the US, the freaks roll down to Kansas. While there, they learn punk, they learn country, and they drink. And we all thank god for the musicians, for they keep our Kansas souls alive.In Split Lip, we have the privilege of listening to an acoustic bass made out of a Ford Gas Tank and a 2x4. Add a guitar, a mandolin, and a banjo and out comes the sweetest sounds you'll ever drink whisky to.See them live, and buy their CDs. They got kids to feed."
5,Pop music gem,"Tim Monger is a Michigan based singer/songwriter who has been on the scene for at least 13 years. Summer Cherry Ghosts is his first solo album and it's a keeper. Lush strings, acoustic guitars, jangley electric guitars and much more abound. The real treat though is Tim's gift for melody and his ability to marry it to the perfect chord change. For the uninitiated, Tim's voice and delivery may be jarring at first... you'll either love it or be turned off if you prefer the more common distanced, disaffected delivery. However, having said that, give Summer Cherry Ghosts a try. Also, if you like this, you'll enjoy the new album by Tim's band Great Lakes Myth Society and the two albums recorded by their previous incarnation, The Original Brothers and Sisters of Love."
2,suitable for the northeast,"Most of the information in this book seems to come from the author's experience building in the Northeast or colder climates. If you live in a warm weather climate he doesn't give enough information about building in these locales. Also, not enough detailed info. on selecting sub-contractors and what they should exactly do for you. I am planning to build my own home and will need to buy another book because this one didn't do it."
3,Helpful hints without editing!,"Mr. Jaegers' book is chock full of handy hints for the homebuilder, but it's difficult to believe that no one at Trojan Homes Publishing Co. can spell! There is nothing that will ruin an author's credibility more than a poorly edited book(or non-edited, in this case)! Though Mr. Jaeger's wisdom and experience in construction shines through the horrible grammar and constant misuse of the possessive ""it's,"" the responsibility for proofreading of his manuscript is the publisher's. I understand that this book should just be a guideline for the homebuilder and that simplicity in typeface and layout of this book probably allowed for initially less expensive publishing costs, but there is just no excuse for this high number of errors to find their way into print!! Despite my ranting about the lack of editing,this book is still a treasure for the all the do-it- yourselfers out there(and I think you know who you are!)."
2,I wish I had bothered to look through it at a bookstore...,"...before buying it online.Its a nice book to have around, but not my first choice by any means. Too general & poorly indexed. If you can only buy one unix related book, then this may be for you, but why not buy a few smaller books on what you actually want to know? Too often I've looked in it for info only to get half my answer & need to look in another source.Personally I don't think it is worth the ten pounds of paper it is printed on."
2,Vague... nothing more to say,"The book is indeed comprehensive in scope, but it leaves a lot to be desired with providing the level of detail that a beginner would need to succeed. I picked it up hoping that it would be a good all around reference so I could learn more about the various flavors of Unix. What I found was confusion.The index isn't even close to complete. The first 4 items I tried to lookup were missing from the index, and very difficult to find in the book. When I did locate them, I didn't find the details I needed. Just a vague description of what I needed to do... no examples... no details. Pretty tough to live with in the Unix world. You need detailed examples to make sure everything works properly. I didn't find that here.This book is getting returned."
4,"Great book, albeit to simple for people that know about Unix","While this book is great overall, if one has had some experience with UNIX in general before, the first chapters will feel like a drag. If one has some simple knowledge of command lines and what they do, or already know perl some of the chapters will be lost on you.But even so, as a professional having used UNIX variants for a while now have found some interesting tips and tricks to both secure my system, and help me write shell scripts faster and more efficient. Definitely worth the time it takes to read."
1,Is there a worse book on MX?,"I've bought dozens of books over the years for all Macromedia and Adobe products and this one is probably the worst. It's like a dictionary that doesn't have the word you're looking up but - sure enough - the word ""chair"" is in there.I have yet to find anything I need in this waste of shelf space. It does, however, tell you that File > New creates a new document."
2,Picture isn't right; did not work with Sharp 3D projector,"The mounting component is strong and made of metal, but it is not as shown in this picture. It may work for some Sharp projector models, but for the Sharp 3D XVZ1700 projector, the holes did not properly align although Sharp said this was the right component. When you call Sharp, they're really unhelpful. They don't know anything and basically read off of the manual which you can clearly do on your own. I had to use a metal drill bit and drill one hole that was the same size in the right spot so that this component would work with the projector. Luckily, it worked and it holds up the projector just fine. Sharp should have one that works with no problems and stop making false directions in their manuals."
5,Great VB6 book,I have this book as a requirement for my advanced VB class and I like it. I provides a great deal of information about VB6 in a clear and well organize form.
2,Not really good Book for learning OO concepts,This book attempts to cover a lot of VB forms kind of stuff but no lacks on coverage of key topics like Object oriented coverage. Now a days most of the Visual basic is used mostly for development of distributed computing and this book doesn't cover that aspect. I won't recommend it for beginners.
2,This Book Needs Proofreading!,"This book came with the price of an ""Intro To VB 6"" course I took this summer (2001). I rely on examples to illustrate and clarify text explanation. I had trouble, in many cases, following both the descriptions of VB features and their examples with this book. Many examples had typos and errors in the code. Its a shame! A competent proofreading would have made this book a lot more helpful. Its unfortunate that schools don't do a better job of evaluating textbooks when they select them (for whatever reason?)."
1,Unbelievable!!!!,"DON""T DARE PICK THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER IN VB PROGRAMMING.I have read quite a few Vb programming books for beginners and this has been the worst so far!! I do not beleive the earlier reveiwers of this book have actually read it! There are endless typo's, POORLY DOCUMENTED CODE, Cornell cannot decide which style to adopt in Dim statements(i.e.Dim I as Integer or Dim I%)There are no exercises at the end of the chapters to help internerlise concepts and please!! who writes a book on programming in 1998 without a DISC!!!!....I could go on forever.This one is a definitely a THUMBS DOWN!!!!This book is way too tedious for a beginner!!!!"
2,Too many pages,This book attempts to cover a lot of VB forms kind of stuff but lacks coverage of key topics like Object oriented coverage. Its not a good book for beginners too.
3,Okay for the first half,"I got lost from the chapter about Array - had to seek for helps online in order to continued- again - get lost on OOP , and several later chapters. But eventually - did read throughout the book. It is worth to mention that Mr. Cornell is a nice author for replying all the questions I sent to him via e-mail.However, this book - or should I say Visual Basic is a great start place for programming. Right now I am learning C++ and at least able to understand what looping, array and recursive mean.Some suggestions I have to improve this book1. Capture the screen output and put it next to the code example2. More code examples and put analysis on each of them- I hate reading definitions alone, want to see some action by running the code :o)3. Have a Summary at the end of each chapter -4. Have a CD that contains these code examples (People who don't have access to the Internet can't get these examples from osborne website.)"
2,"Lots of information, serious lack of explanation and samples","Perhaps this book would prove useful to an experienced programmer, but for a novice it is not a good choice. Cornell ""assumes no previous programming experience"", then goes on to write in huge, sweeping generalities without adequate explanations. Also, the code in the book is often written so the reader cannot fathom the type of event the code is associated with, and no explanations are forthcoming in the body of the text.There really is a lot covered in this book, but unless you do indeed have ""previous programming experience"", not worth the cash."
2,This book didn't help,"This book has several errors. The example tutorials in this book are okay. However it doesn't help me with writing more complex programs. For example, I am working on a program to run my own play-by-mail wrestling league to rival and crush the stagnant IWA, run by Johnny B. Gary Cornell's way of describing syntax statements just didn't help me in my quest."
2,"Visual Basic 6, From The Ground Up","This book is difficult to follow and tedious. By the time you get to write code, you can't figure out how to get them to run. Even though I have some programming experience, I found this book to be of limited value."
4,Get it before it's gone...,"This book is a great introduction to VB6. It covers everything you need to know to use VB6 to create your own programs. All of the basics are covered. The IDE is covered along with all the relevant tools. The basic language syntax is also covered so you'll know how to write the code behind the various events. The book has well thought out and thoroughly explained examples, which is very important in my opinion. The book is a good starting point for the beginning VB programmer."
2,Disappointed so far.,"Two cents from a rank amateur/beginning programmer. At the moment, I'm on page 179 of this book and the main problem I have so far is with the way the information is communicated. Personally, I now know that I should have picked up a book that taught VB concepts via small projects and tasks. A ""in chapter 1 we'll build a simple tool to get familiar w/ the IDE. In chapter 2 we'll improve our skillset by building a slightly advanced tool to learn about declaring variables, etc."" approach would work better for me. Unfortunately, this book doesn't really do that. The concepts here are explained mostly with bits of standalone code. Hopefully, perhaps by page 200, we'll commence with some ""learning by doing."" Yes, hopefully. In the meantime, I'll grit my teeth and continue with the book, but right now it simply isn't working for me."
4,Help with yhe size,"The only thing is the size, we need a size chart, so that we dont buy them just by guessing"
4,Seems to be working well,"I bought the antenna so I would have better reception in my basement. I had to run it out a window and the magnet holds it to the siding on the house (I placed plastic around it to prevent rusting). I have had 3-4 bars of signal, consistently and the calls seem clear. My Motorola Razr was useless and never had signal in my basement before I used the antenna. Only complaint is that the cord is a little short and it only worked after I put it outside (it didn't work by just placing it by the window on the inside)."
1,RAZRV3 Antenna Kit,This unit ordered for my Motorala RAVR V3 phone is totally useless. There was no way provided to connect the antenna to my phone -- presumably this would have to be through the charging port.
4,Brady Games,"The Pac Man World 3 guide is a great way to get through the tough spots and to make sure you didn't miss anything. My only complaint with this product is that some of the screen shots are pretty small and hard to see much detail. But, I wouldn't hesitate to order another guide from Brady Games in the future."
4,Very good single,"I didn't like the second studio album of the Darkness, however, this single is very powerful and it gets to you very easily."
2,at least it's cheap,"Fit's perfectly, protects well (including screen), will NEVER fall out.....but: It attracts every particle possible. Dust, hair, cathair, furnature fabrics & everything else will coat the case. On the bright side, I paid about $1.50 for mine with free shipping, so it's a nice back-up to my Griffin leather snap-on case."
4,convenent,"Booster seat is easy to place in car, older child can get in and out without alot of help. Child likes light of sides of head rest."
1,You can't tell a book by its cover....,"Reading all of the reviews here, and taking into account the sheer size of it, I expected to have the best overall Oracle reference on the market, right? Wrong. This book is literally 1200 pages of PL/SQL with a scant chapter on general relational database concepts. If you are looking for a book explaining architecture and administration tips, this is not for you. The only reason I gave it one star was it's in-depth look into the Oracle data dictionary."
2,POOR CD bundled with this book,"Appendix-A of this book contains all the tables, and data used in the examples thoughout theook. The CDROM however contains formatted .PDF files. It is impossible to extract the data from the .pdf files and create the tables in Oracle. I'm very surprised no one else has mentioned this fact. This would be a GREAT book if you could easily create and populate an Oracle database with the Appendix A tables.Oracle 8i, The Complete Reference, pg 1224 Part IX: Appendix ""The tables in the appendix are on the CD that comes bundled with this book, so you can access these tables without retyping. You can use these tables to easily work your way through the examples and experiment with the many techniques that are illustrated in the book."" NOT!"
3,"Broad coverage, but lacks depth","This book is a handy reference to a variety of ORACLE 8i topics. But, it doesn't go into any chapter in depth. For instance, if you look into PL/SQL, there is hardly 15 to 20 pages of reference material. Most of the times, I end up searching the web to get the answers (technet, metalink etc).The syntax reference that you can view online at TECHNET.ORACLE.COM, fills up almost 25% of the book.Overall, it is a bulky but shallow reference book."
1,Wins MOST POORLY ORGANIZED AWARD,"Of all the reference books for computer science subjects that I own, I have yet to find a book more poorly organized. Sure, there MIGHT be a lot of information in there, but if you can't find it, what good is it?It is really a pitiful mess. My advice - Buy almost anything else about Oracle, leave this one to collect dust."
3,Good Story - though a little long,"I did enjoy Prophit Annie to a point. After awhile it just felt like it rambled until I couldn't wait until the ending. I enjoyed the style it was written in. Reading it felt as if you were talking to an older relative relating what it was like in their time. Where Prophit Annie was good, if you want to experience a fantastic western story - pick up Ellen Recknor's ""Me and the Boys"" (out-of-print service). I think Me and the Boys was way above better than Prophit Annie."
3,So so...,The best thing about these sheets I think is the color. I've had them about 4 months now and they really don't launder well. Come out kind of wrinkly. They're ok but I wouldn't buy them again.
3,Great symphony competently performed but inferior sound quality,"Furtwaengler's symphonies are directly of the Austro-German tradition created by the romantic masters such as Bruckner and Brahms. They are not really master pieces (maybe with the exception of No.2), but are great works from a composer who knows how to write music of substance. This is particularly precious in an age when almost everybody else could not help his desire for ""originality"" and ridiculed himself with the fundamentally corrupted neo-classicism, impressionism, atonalism and other rubbish-isms.However, the quality of the recording is questionable. The sound is dry, low, and lifeless. At full price, the disk doesn't offer good value either. A recent recording of this symphony from the bargain label Arte Nova with Staatskapelle Weimar conducted by Albrecht is more recommendable, though the symphony, at 83 minutes, is spread on 2 disks."
2,Symphonic wanderings,"If you really want to sample Furtwangler the composer I'd suggest his second symphony. The recording I've heard of Chicago conducted by Barenboim is of good quality, and the music is much more coherant than what is found in this release.In a few spots pleasant themes emerge, but they are never developed in a discernablefashion. Furtwangler apparently loved Bruckner, Wagner and Strauss, and the ideasin his symphonies seem to me derivatives of those great masters. The Marco Polo recording is also rather dry. Search elsewhere if undiscovered masterpieces are your objective."
5,A classic rocket that withstands the test of time.,You can't go wrong with an Estes rocket kit. The Big Bertha is one of the longstanding entires from their lineup. The only differences between this Big Bertha kit and those that I built in the 70s are the decal package and the fact that the fins are now laser cut. Other than that it's precisely the same.* A joy to build* A riot to fly* Dynamite learning experience -- building and launching the rocket* Good quality materials
3,"Tube seems a little flimsy. Packaging Okay, but no box.","I feel like tube could be stronger, but this may be standard. Packing could be a little better.A little over-priced once you seems that this kit cost less than a dollar to produce and I neversay that. Will probably be a great rocket, but I would paint with multiple cost and a hard finish.They should offer this rocket with platform, controlled and motors/pads as one kit for $30-$45"
5,"VERY BIG, VERY Fun","This rocket is a classic and flies very well. I also like the size of this rocket. Unfortunatley, I lost this one upon my first launch to a tree. I do plan to get another one, so that should say something. The only negative I would say it that is the rocket did not launch ""slow"" like a real rocket. It launch just as any otehrrocket does, but its still fun."
3,Wrong Decal/Theme Sent,"Be Aware - Instead of the decal set shown in the product photos, the Big Bertha rocket we received has a decal set that reads ""Big Bertha"" in large retro letters. It will fly just the same, but really wanted and expected the one shown in photos."
4,"Great kit, but description was a little off","This is a great kit, probably the easiest ""big"" rocket to build. I was a little disappointed that what was described as ""Big, burly, BLACK and beautiful"" arrived at my door with the stickers for the retro yellow scheme, but I can live with that. The instructions aren't quite as noob friendly as other skill level one (beta) kits from Estes, and it was kind of silly that you had to cut out the part of the instructions (tube marking guide) that contained step 4 on the other side, in order to complete step 3. However, anyone who has built one beta rocket before would be able to follow the directions just fine. Overall a fun rocket that is a must-have for anyone's fleet."
4,lost,we got this rocket because it has a slower take-offbut when we lunched it....we lost it.but 3 blocks away we found it.
2,Didn't know I needed other items for it to operate,Dang - I bought several of these only to find out I need about $50 - $100 additional items in order to make it work. Money down the drain.
3,It's an alright book,Not too much content. It seems like a motivational book to kick your butt in gear. I was already motivated and wanted content so it wasn't the right book for me.
5,A No Brainer Guide To Real Estate Investing,"I've read dozens of books about real estate investing, but this one is by far the best. It's easy to read, understands and the plans of action are realistic and achieveable. Any reading this book can feel like they can get started right away. It's probably the only real estate investing book you'll ever need."
3,Why doesn't Gary believe in leverage?,"After waffling a bit, Gary firmly endorses paying off your house through extra payments. The same money could be used to purchase investment property. I have never understood how people can put down 10%, see that their house's value has gone up 10% in a year or two, and then, after having had a first hand demonstration of the power of leverage, decide that their loan is something they want to get rid of.If you have all sorts of extra cash coming in, I guess you can pay off your home, but for most of us, our home's equity is our first source of downpayment money for investment property."
5,A must read for any real estate investor,"34 years in the real estate business 25 of those years as an investor and educator gives me a real appreciation for this book. This is a must read for anyone considering investing in real estate or pursuing a career in real estate. Strong sound advise anchored with real life examples of people who have made the transition of Millionaire Real Estate Investors makes this book different than most get rich books.I am using the principles found in this book in my teachings and though I was given my copy I've bought additional copies for family and friends.Buy it, read it, believe it, it will change your life!"
2,Cheerleading and little else.,"This book like so many others on the subject is a real let down. It tells about why you should invest in RE but not how. A good book on how is- Start Small, Profit Big in Real Estate : Fixer Jay's 2-Year Plan for Building Wealth - Starting from Scratch. Your time and money would be much better spent on either of these. ReadMobile Home Wealth: How to Make Money Buying, Selling and Renting Mobile Homesinstead."
1,Content is disaapointing,"This book is not worth your time. It covers the most basic material, and full of clichés, generalities and fallacies. If you are over 20 years old and if you actually find something new in this book, then you definitely shouldn't be investing in real estate. You might get lucky when the tide is rising, but you will likely loose it all."
3,Good overall picture but light on specifics,I was hoping for more details on the different types of real estate transactions while the book is more focused on just getting you excited about real estate and getting started. Pretty good if you need something to lift you up and get you going but very light on details - models discussed are very high level.
1,MK,"I just received this book and I purchased it based on the 5 starts given by other readers. I am very disappointed. The book is full of ""fluff"" to cut to the chase. It keeps on talking about all these different paralells about how one choose not miss opportunities. It lacks on specifics.I expected some real pointers on what potential investors should do to get traction on their real estate investment. What mistakes to avoid. How to properly evaluate proterties. Look at cash flow etc. Real investment issues.Big disappointment. I plan on returning this book."
3,too creepy,"Although this is certainly an important topic, I don't think it should be accessible to children. It's too disturbing."
4,why is there singing?,"for goldie, it's a pretty good example of proprer mixology. the tracks are solid, but i just can't stand lyrics in my jungle, unless it's rastafarian stuff. minimal vocalization would make this cd a five star, by my count."
2,May work if you have good pressure to start with,I have low water pressure and was looking to improve it with this item -however - this item did not help me improve the flow - it made it worse - so the item is fine - i am guessing you just need decent water pressure to start with for it to work better -i had to return it - i think its just my water pressure is too low to start with - or else it may have worked fine -
5,A Great First Impression,During my first year of Graduate school towards earning my MFA I was asked if I had ever heard of Ida Appleboorg. I admitted that I had never heard of her and asked what she did. After a brief conversation ending with me writing down her name and promising I would look into her work I went to the university's library. They had a couple books and I spent hours pouring through them over and over until I knew I wanted to see more.I ordered this book and have about worn it out. First it is a beautiful full color book with a beautiful format. It contains both installation and individual views of her work. I really was able to get a sense of the artist and how she paints. It is a beautiful book and a broad introduction to a great contemporary artist. What a role model for young female artists.
2,"Good examples, but many errors","First of all, this book is not a reference. It is a book of samples and tutorials. It won't give you details about commands, objects or the nitty-gritty of why things work. It gives you examples of how to do things and only a very general discussion on how it works. It's up to you to learn the details from other sources. So you are best to purchase this with another more detailed reference that will give you the real low-down on ADO.NET.Second and most troubling is that this book seems to be filled with errors. Some of their examples don't work. After following the steps in the book to the letter, your program won't run and you have to take time (sometimes minutes, sometimes hours) digging through other sources to figure out what this book didn't tell you so you can get things working.This book answers many questions, but not all. Use it in conjunction with other materials."
4,Excellent Anthology,"This book offers a very good introduction into the work of Johann Baptist Metz. The work of this important Roman Catholic foundational theologian is not as well known in the United States. Dr. Downey has performed a great service making Metz's thought and methods available to Roman Catholics in the United States. Metz's arguments and proposals represent important insights into the foundational social-critcal aspects of Christianity. Such topics as ""the dangerous memory of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ"", ""the future in the memory of suffering,"" and the need for a real grappling with the theological problems posed by Auschwitz are some of the important theological questions that need to be addressed by modern theology. I would liked to have seen a longer and more detailed introduction and analysis of Metz's theology by Dr. Downey. However, his overall anthology is a must read for anyone in ministry and should be required reading for theology students."
5,Profoundly moving,"I 'happened' upon Tina Malia at a recent Qi Revolution program. She was the lunchtime entertainment, go figure. I put this CD in my car the next day. The rendition of Gayatri Mantra is profound. About half-way through the second chant, I noticed that tears were streaming from my eyes. The only words that seem appropriate are 'the peace of God that surpasses all understanding'. These chants can touch one to the very core."
4,bought as a gift,hopefully this will help develop a good reading habit as well as encourage curiosity and foster an interest in mysteries
5,Great Level 2 Reader,This is a great book for beginning readers. It is written far better than a lot of other Level 2 readers based on a superhero or tv character. a little long but holds the reader's interest. My son was getting a little tired of reading but needed to finish the story so he would know how the mystery was solved. I would love to get more Big Max books.
5,Touching & Sad,This book was so good I couldn't put it down! I recomended it to my best friends(C.B.& M.C.) and they loved this book too. This book was written with so much feeling and emotion! I loved it! One of my favourite children's books of all time!
3,Not my favorite book,"Haven't gotten very far in to the book, but I have to finish it for a class. Definitely not my favorite :/"
3,sweet,Sweet story just was not thrilled with abrupt ending. The character had great courageand over all the book gave you the feeling of being a part of what was happening.
5,works great,Purchased this for my boyfriend for his new expresso machine. It provides enough room for the froth and keeps the temp consistent.
4,Great,This pitcher is fantastic. The only down fall is I wish I would've ordered the size bigger. It cleans very easily also.
5,works,works out great with the delonghi we bought. not sure what else to say about a frothing cup except that it works.
1,Dangerous!,I didn't think much could go wrong with a frothing pitcher but I guess I was wrong. The one I received had a small steel shard coming out of it where the handle attaches to the body. I was about to use it when I noticed it. What if it would have dislodged in the milk? Quality Control Fail which makes for a potentially dangerous product.
2,QC,"I like it but it was defective when it arrived. It actually had a hole in the side,But its a great size. Disappointed in QC of company."
4,Works for me!,"The steaming wand on my espresso maker is a little short, so with the right technique I am able to create a rich frothy foam with this pitcher. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Great Pot,"The pot works great. Filled to the bottom of spout with 2% milk, and using a Krups espresso maker steamer wand, the milk steams perfectly to approximately double in volume. The creamy milk can be poured into a doubleshot cup of espresso to make a perfect cappuccino. Creamy foam must be spooned (proper proportion is 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk and 1/3 foam). I've never been able to froth to the point where the foam pours (for example into a heart shape). Having the spout is a huge improvement on just steaming milk in a mug."
3,Tiny but works well with Mr. Coffee,"Tiny but works well with Mr. Coffee Espresso Maker. Shipping was super fast as usual. I would opt for the larger 20oz for a full mug size cup of cappuccino. Certainly not enough for 2 people who likes to drink caramel macchiato like its water. However, it is sturdy and made rather well."
2,The little frothing pitcher that...couldn't,"In my opinion, this 12oz pitcher is just too small if you want a decent amount of froth. I can use 1/4c of milk in it and have to do this twice to get my drink exactly how I like it. If I could do it over again, I would go for the 20oz. For now, I will continue using it but once I get a larger one, this little guy will spend the rest of its days in the bathtub for my kids to play with while soaking."
5,Great!,Its simple basic and works well with my espresso steamer. I keep it in the fridge to keep it cold.
3,Not by Saeco but fit to DeLonghi EC155,"I purchased this frothing pitcher for DeLonghi EC155 having very short steal nozzle.Initially it seemed this was made by Saeco famous in household espresso machine, but what I got was made by Update.I don't know the relationship between Saeco and Update, but it still fits to my machine."
4,Cheap Frothing Solution,"Well, it's a frothing pitcher. There's not much else to say. It looks good, shiny on the exterior with a brushed steel interior. The handle is a little thin, and looks kind of cheap, but it serves its purpose. The only glaringly ugly feature is the logo on the bottom, which you'd think they would take care to imprint, but no one sees the bottom, so that's ok. This pitcher is the perfect height for myDeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker, and works great. Overall, if you don't have a lot of money to spend on accessories, I would recommend this pitcher. If you really care about looks and a more comfortable handle (you're only holding it for maybe 30 sec at most anyway), then you might want to consider something more expensive. However, this is the perfect size for cappuccino, which I what I use it for, and the price tag is attractive."
4,Little Small,"I have a hard time giving this three stars because it deserves more since I just have no concept of how much an ounce is :). I thought 12 ounces would be enough to be able to play around with the milk for Latte art on my drinks but it helps if you have enough milk for the drink. Personally I would upgrade to the bigger pitcher unless you only drink true doppio macchiato's (the drinks in the tiny cups). I am a Starbucks Barista and know when I see a quality product and this definately meets my standards. Good product, just stupid buyer :)."
4,Steaming your milk,Very nice quality stainless. A must have if you enjoy steaming your milk for Lattes and Cappucinos. Frothing of milk is a real joy in this pitcher
3,good,Wish I would have bought a bigger size but otherwise this product is great. I use in for my espresso machine.
3,frothing pitcher too small,"I purchased the 12 oz frothing pitcher thinking that it would be adequate in size for making single-serve lattes. Unfortunately, even with the pitcher filled with 1/4 milk (3/4 empty), it still overflows when the milk is being steamed. I would recommend purchasing the larger size."
1,Stainless pitcher,The depth of the stainless pitcher is too tall forthe frother. It is impossible to drop the nozzle down farenough into the milk to get a good foam.The pitcher is fine but not good for the design of the particularespresso machine for which it is suggested.
3,easy measurements,this is the perfect size for the 4 cup expresso machine. the only issue is that non dairy don's foam well
4,"Smaller than you think it will be, but fine for one serving","Beware - even though the description says 12 ounces (and it IS an accurate measure), you'll be stunned at how tiny it is when you see this pitcher in person. This pitcher is great if you're frothing for only one serving - I use skim milk when I froth with my Breville Infuser machine - about 4 ounces of skim milk and it will double in size. It gets near the pitcher's top. This washes up easily, seems to do fine in the top rack of the dishwasher. It's hard to wash by hand, as the pitcher is tapered, smaller at the top and hard to get your hand and sponge into (and I have a small hand)."
4,"EP-12 Stainless Steel Frothing Pitcher, 12-Ounce","EP-12 Stainless Steel Frothing Pitcher, 12-OuncePerfect for my machine, only thing had small dent from shipping.keeps steam milk hot"
5,Good Product,"Purchased an espresso machine, the spoons and the frothing pitcher as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. Items were all as described and received in a timely manner. Thanks!"
3,Nice build quality but too small.,"This is a decently built pitcher, but too small for good frothing action -- tends to spill over. A 20 oz. pitcher seems to work better.This pitcher's dimensions are: about 2.65"" wide at the top, about 2.8"" wide at the bottom and about 3.6"" deep."
1,A little small & our handle fell off in a month,"I was initially impressed with the frothing pitcher when we received ours from Amazon. However, being a espresso/cappuccino novice I didn't realize a few things. First, the pitcher is a little tall to fit under the frothing wand on our newly purchased De'Longhi EC155. Not a big deal because with a little finesse it could still be accomplished. And besides, not really to be held against the pitcher, more of my fault. Second, the 12 oz size, as many others have said, is pretty restrictive when trying to get a good froth. Again, more my fault/inexperience then to be blame on the product. However, the final straw is that the handle fell off our pitcher after about a month of use. The pitcher was never put through the dishwasher. . . and even if it was, should it really fail after a month of. Maybe we were just unlucky and received one produced on a Friday or something. Either way, one star for being so fragile."
2,Handle is rusting after only 5 days!,"I bought this ""stainless steel"" pitcher instead of a more expensive one. I got it 5 days ago and have used it to steam milk approximately 9 times since then. I have not run it through the dishwasher at all, but have washed it by hand. The handle is already rusting where it joins with the body of the pitcher! Also, the ""spout"" is nowhere near as pronounced as in the photo, making it more like pouring out of a plain drinking glass than out of a pitcher.Definitely regretting going cheaper on this purchase. :("
4,Better used as a creamer due to its small size,"This is indeed a very small frother as others have already stated. When I got it I doubted that it even held 12 ounces, but sure enough, 12 ounces means the milk fills the pitcher to the brim. Which means you can't really froth 12 ounces of milk, but rather 6 ounces. It is thus better used as a small creamer on a large table setting, or for a very small milk steamer. It is otherwise an attractive little piece.Otherwise this is solidly build. The handle does not get hot while the milk is steaming.This product is made in China. A white label had been placed over that statement on the outside package as if to hide that fact."
1,Beware of size!,They need to place this pitcher beside something else as a measuring device so you can see the actual size. This looks like it goes to a childs tea set!
