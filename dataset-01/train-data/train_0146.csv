5,Great Saw,"This replaced a old 10"" ryobi miter saw that finally gave out right in the middle of building my new garage. I have had nothing but great experiences with delta tool as I also own a 10"" delta table saw that cost 900.00 and it replaced an old sears. this miter saw works great the twin lasers are terrific just love em. no more trying to determine exactly where the blade will cut. Must have item for any body needing a miter saw with great performance, P.S. I also have a 13"" delta planer I'm defintely hooked on Delta."
4,Dreiser and Me,"I read Sister Carrie when I was a teenager in China. The other day I listened to a Hoosier's holiday on Talking Books. He went back to his hometown after some thirty years. I went back to my hometown, Hangzhou, China and saw my old house now completely destroyed and replaced by a huge scaffolding. Somehow I felt my experience wasn't so different from Dreisers. I liked the book so much I'm going to order a copy to read certain parts again, although I have been in Indianapolis exactly once in my lifetime. Indianapolis and Hangzhou are world's apart. Dreiser and me are only 50 years apart but I feel I knew how he felt. Kai Lai Chung"
4,Standing Alone: An American Woman's Struggle for the Soul of Islam,"Very interesting personal account and insight of a single, Muslim mother in a world that is far different from that in America. As a bonus, the reader receives a detailed lesson and analysis of modern Islam and its deviation from the origans of Islam founded my Muhammad during the early 600AD. This widely knowledgeable author also includes relevant history as it effects the modern Islamic world. Having known little of Islam, I found it a very worthwhile read in learning about a world that often conflicts with American's interests."
1,Exaggeration even in the Book's introduction,In the introduction you write your 'infant son was living proof of your zina (sex out of wedlock)'? how was it living proof? did you declare that to the Saudi authorities in your Hajj visa application? or did you say that the Saudi immigration? All that a infant travelling alone with you showed was that either you were divorced or had permission from your husband to travel alone as required by Saudi authorities. It would seem you are trying to exaggerate some perceived threat to your person in order to dramatize this book in order to sell your book.
4,Pre-History,"In all honesty, it's been years since I last read Setting Free The Bears, but I can still find the paragraphs that resonate:""Some people are proud and some have their doubts. And I can look at how left out of these times I feel - how I rely on pre-history for any sense and influence - and I can simplify this aforementioned garble. I can say: all anyone has is their pre-history. Feeling that you live at an interim time is something in the nature of being born and all the things that never happen to you after birth.""If these words strike a chord with you, this is a book you should read. It is closer to ""The Cider House Rules"" or ""A Prayer For Owen Meany"" in character but is more cohesive; it is fantastic but wisely stops short of the extremes of ""The World According to Garp"" or ""The Hotel New Hampshire"". It is a novel full of ghosts, of surreal acknowledgement of the things that *do* happen to us after birth, even as we fail to recognize their importance."
5,A Forgotten Masterpiece,"Having read Garp, Owen, Hotel NH, and Widow, I decided that I should read some of Irving's earlier stuff. I tore through 158-lb., but not because it was any good. It was, in fact, one of the most poorly-written novels I've read in a long time. Setting Free the Bears, on the other hand, was absolutely marvelous. The zoo-diary interspersed with the 'highly-selective autobiography' was pure magic, and the end, with the Rare Spectacled Bears loping across a field together after Gallen had just left the hero (I'm blanking on his name) was an exquisite, classic Irving irony."
2,Hard to read - for true Irving fans only,"I've never before been pretentious enough to think I could see an author developing through their work but I think I'm starting to with John Irving. This is his first book I believe and has some strong characters and an interesting plot but it very hard to read. Obsenities in the story are weakened into something unintelligable and the whole thing is hard to get through.I read his second book, 'The Water Method Man', right after this, and it is similar in style but a nicer story and easier to read (a bit).If you are just starting out with John Irving, don't start here! 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' and 'The World According to Garp' are delightful - start there!"
2,Slightly disappointing,"After reading the wonderfully Irving's imaginative, captivating and sometimes zany books, The World According to Garp, A prayer for Owen Meany, The Cider House Rules, Hotel New Hampshire and Widow for One Year, Setting Free the Bears was a let down. The characters were extremely annoying and hard to stomach. After reading about Siggy for 150 pages I was ready to put the book down. I don't know much about motorcycles, and dodn't care to learn. I'll admit, maybe Setting Free the Bears just wasn't a book for me. Whatever you do, don't let reading this bland novel turn you off to John Irving's other novels. Most of them are supurb."
1,The rest of you are lying; you couldn't finish it.,"There's no John Irving novel I don't love, except this one. Most of them, I have re-read about five times. Even ""The Water-Method Man"", one of his weaker novels, I read twice.I couldn't finish this one, not in THREE separate attempts, at three very different times in my life, three different frames of mind. There's nothing wrong with my reading skills. I'm forced to conclude the rest of you are lying.Siggy and Hannes are simply not characters one can care about, and the actual writing is wretched."
4,ragged and wonderful,"Having met John in Iowa City before Garp was published, BEARS was all I knew of his work. I just re-read it.Despite some lack of polish, it still moves me the most. Could be I love motobikes, could be I know Austria, but mostly it captures the ridiculous intensity and bittersweet nature of relationships at that age."
4,Love the Premise,"Love the premise of this work: Setting free the animals in a German zoo. It inspired lots of fantasies as to how the same could be done in Chicago!!! Irving can craft a fine story, and make it entertaining and compelling. He's certainly done that in this book."
4,The beginning...,Everytime I read a John Irving book I love this author a little bit more. Though there are better books that he has written it is still a wonderful story and worth the time to read.
3,Not for lovers of later Irving,"I first read Irving's later books, A Prayer for Owen Meany, Garp, Hotel New Hampshire and Son of the Circus. I loved those books and only wish that I had more of John Irvings to read. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by Setting Free the Bears. As one of his earlier works, I could see where he was headed, but it does not compare favorably to his more mature work."
4,Exceeded my price-performance expectations,"The guy who couldn't joint with this thing: not sure what the problem was. I bought this machine with serious reservations. I just used it this weekend to joint some boards after learning the hard way that you cannot joint with sandpaper and elbow grease. I was very nervous based on the one bad review. But I ran the boards through, put them together...no seam whatsoever. At $210 and 35 lbs, this thing rocks. I just took it for a weekend trip to my parents in the trunk of my Passat. Try that with a 400 lb stationary model. Why not 5 stars? Eh, anything that gets 5 stars from me better do the dishes."
4,awesome,I bought my jointer and had it set up in about 15 minutes.the only problems i had were the knives.the knives that came with it kept chipping out.I sharpened them 2 times and kept having the same problems.I purchased 2 new sets of knives and the problems were gone.I must have just gotten a bad set.I love mine.Worth every penny.
1,"NO, NO, NO!!!","This is NOT, IMHO, worth what it cost to manufacture the styrofoam it's packaged in. That fence drove me nuts, and plan on spending 1/2 hour trying (KEYWORD) to align it. I'm surprisd that Delta selected such a poor choice of materials for this Unit.Save your money and buy either the next Unit up (I believe that is the 360?) and while it's twice the price you're getting 10X the quality. Likewise Ridgid's new Jointer: $399 and worth every cent.You can spend $200 now on a cheaply made design or 2X and have a cast iron Unit that'll last you a lifetime.Just my .02 (about the worth of the Delta JT-160).I'd give it several ""Negative"" Stars as a rating but unfortunately, it's not an option."
3,Decent hobbiest tool but double check the table,"This is a decent tool - good for small size projects. It is good for a small shop as it is lightweight and can be stored away to free up space (which is what I must do). A word of caution however, be sure to double check the tables (infeed and outfeed) for level. It set up faily easily out of the box, but I couldn't get good joints despite several adjustments. After close examination, I discovered that one of the tables was warped. The good news is that Delta customer service sent out 2 new tables immediatly (next day delivery). Both were perfectly flat and were a snap to install. Since then all my jointing has been great. It's worth the price."
1,piece of junk,i actually read these reviews before i bought this thing and actually ignored the negitive reviews. Every bad thing in these reviews came true when i set it up the plastic handles broke i couldn't get the fence square and it was warped and the friction on it was horrible. The table scrached after 2 days and wood got jammed under the blade and when i went to take the blade off the screws stripped i owned this jointer for 4 days and i returned it for the craftsman one that was only 20 dollars more but all cast iron what i difference
4,JT160 jointer,"Tool is fairly good for a jointer in this price range. it is powerfull enough to plain 6"" rock maple without stalling (although at minimium stock removal)"
3,Delta JT160 Shopmaster,Good on small to mid size projects.Nice speed controls. A bit loud on high speed but not too bad- wear protection.
1,Put Your money toward something better,"I'm on my second Delta jointer planer. The first planer was delivered with a bent in-feed table. The table was bent one half an inch down at the end of the table and had a large chip in the table top. It looked so bad I just look at it and shook my head in disbelief. I sent it back, then I re-ordered. The second jointer came with two cracked tables plus a dent in the edge of the out-feed table. Both tables had a dip in the center of over 24000 of an inch plus some nicks in the top's. It was useless to me. If you pay your hard earned money for a tool and that tool does not do the job it was intended to do then it's junk and not worth the money you paid. I was really wanting this to be a good jointer because it was just the right size for my shop and was not that heavy. I guess you just can't beat Cast Iron.Don't waste you time on this Cheap Delta unit. Everyone that gave this unit a bad report was right. I should of listened."
4,This machine works great,"I would recommend this machine for the average woodworker. It fits great under the bench, when not in use, and I have used it to joint hard wood like oak and hard maple. It was easy to adjust the fence and knives."
2,"Nice machine, but not accurately setup.","The infeed table on my machine was tilted down on the outfeed side by a 32nd of an inch or so. Being new to jointing, I didn't figure this out until it was too late to return it. My boards were coming out with a crown. The ends were tapering. After working on my technique for a while, I finally looked to see if the machine could be off. Sure enough the tables were not parallel to each other. There are no adjustments on the machine to fix this. I had to rig up a solution by putting rubber washers under the infeed table. Still not 100% there, but a lot better."
4,Great Tool,"Despite the negative reviews I took a chance and ordered this bench top jointer from Amazon because of the great price and free shipping. I'm happy to say I was delighted. I have had it for about a month now and it is working well. As described in the instructions, it only took about 30 minutes to set it up. The fence was right on for 90 degrees right out of the box. I make small boxes and other small craft items and this jointer is perfect for this type of work. I can re-saw small pieces, clean them up on the jointer and they are ready for final sanding. There two things to be aware of: the blades need to be cleaned with blade cleaner frequently (about every other cut), and the dust chute needs to be vacuumed out thoroughly. With these two precautions it performs just fine. As others have said, for larger projects a larger machine would be better but this can edge or plane pieces up to about 4 ft long and for smaller projects it is ideal."
1,I need to buy a new Jointer now.,"Well, I almost completed a dresser for my daughter before this piece broke. Now I need to buy a real jointer.Dont buy it!"
1,A Bad Thing To Buy,"I broke the Prime Directive in buying: Thou shall not buy refurbished good! I got the jointer out of the box, plugged it in, and it blew up on me in the first 30 seconds! I unplugged the thing fearing it might start an electrical fire.I should have known better. There is nothing worth buying refurbished. If an item was sent back, it was sent back for a reason and you never know if the guy who repaired it was having a bad day or not; why take the chance? I was seduced by the price, but I won't make the same mistake twice. As they say, buyer beware!But I do have to say that Delta, the jointer's manufacturer, was polite and they refunded my money promptly. But it's a pity that I don't have a jointer for a while."
2,Arived and returned the same afternoon,"The only good things I can say about this is 1) it's fairly easy to assemble and 2) it will give you a decent straight board edge. Aside from that it's a complete waste of money IMO.Mine arrived, I took it home, assembled it and ran through some cherry, sapele, wenge, and purpleheart and the edges were smooth and straight. When I turned the board face down to plane it the machine's underpowered motor really showed up and chewed into my board 1/2 the way through.I usually use a Grizzly 12.5 planer which I love and works wonderfully but this Delta was a real disappointment in the planing side.Save your money and buy a Grizzly or Jet jointer (heck the Craftsman ones will probably work just a well) if you want to do both jointing/planing. If you already have a planer, then you could use this for edge jointing and while it will work, that's all you'll be able to do with it."
3,Warped outfeed table caused me to return this item,"I had high hopes for this little guy. A small jointer for my small workshop - perfect! I set out to joint some 3ft. long boards to make a coffee table, only to find a very visible gap in the middle of every joint. A straight edge proved that the outfeed table was warped - bowed in the middle - which caused the gap.I torn on whether to try this model again, or bite the bullet, carve out some more garage space and buy a ""real"" jointer."
3,WetterWashington reviews,"A hobbiest tool, but it works. I set the fence and don't change it from 90, all I need is square joints.Yes, it's not a pro tool, but it doesn't cost like one. People that expect Pro quality for Hobby prices and living on a river in Egypt (ie in-d-Nile)"
4,Great Jointer for the price & space it takes,"I've used this Jointer for the past few months and so far I've been impressed. It arrived almost perfectly squared with minimal effort to get it to 100%. It's handled hard and soft wood small stock well. Larger items tend to be more challenging unless you set up a stable outfeed table. While you won't get museum quality flatness with hardwood, it definitely answers the mail for smaller home products. It was a lot quieter than I expected. The only downside I've observed it that softwood shavings tend to build up on the outfeed side, even with a vacuum port attachment. I've found that after a few passes, I have to stop and vacuum up into the outfeed recess. Otherwise for the price and limited space it take, I've been impressed."
5,Like good alt-rock from the 80's???,"Then get this.""New wave Hot Dogs"" has some great songs and I like Yo La Tengo from this era a ton more than the sleepy-long-winded compositions they think pass for music these days.I want something that sounds good in the car driving over the speed limit reclessly and stuff I can add to compelations that doesn't make me drift off. ""President Yo La Tengo"" is a masterpiece of guteral rock that still has pop influence.I would have purchase one or the other for the price of both. Like another reviewer says these song are pure genius."
2,you can't go back in time,"I sabotaged this album for myself when I heard their later work first. If you know how amazing they got in the mid-90's (see Electr-O-Pura), you're doomed to disappointment if you haven't heard this already. Some impressive guitar work, but... thumbs down."
5,Great harnesses!,"I ordered 3 of these and they all work perfectly for my little furball ferrets. They are just right in size, and not too noisy, but still loud enough to hear them running. We had to feed the ferrets treats so they would hold still long enough to put them on, but that was alright. For a little while, the ferrets will rub against the floor and act strange, but it's just because they are not used to them, so make sure to make them comfortable.Wonderful product, shipped very fast, and they fit perfectly with the just right amount of adjustment room."
3,Just Okay,"I've read every book in this series and have enjoyed every one of them. I rated this book as just okay because the action between the characters seemed rather formula written... I never felt a connection with the characters and had to push through to the end. Really strange to read a futuristic (off-world) book and then have regular mundane (real-time) items referenced, like a box of crouton's for their salad... Just a light read, don't expect any great story."
3,Long in the Tooth,Usually I am a very large fan of Amanda Quick so I thought I would try one by Jayne Castle. Too many this and thats. Small plot. Hard to keep track of what was going on. Mental Rees.
4,Every thing old is new again,"It's been a while since I've read Jayne Castle's Harmony series and this is a welcome addition to the lot. The book reads like JC started it just when she finished the last Harmony book. Amazing really. So if your a fan who has read this author under her many pen names this will take you back to an earlier time. If this is new to you it is a fast, eventful read and worth picking up."
5,A nice paranormal story,Albeit this book is a paranormal story is not eerie or spooky at any time. The love story is different from other books because it starts backwards -they're going to marry and Elly decides to jilt Cooper. This is written in the third page of the book.In the other hand you'll read about a futuristic planet far far away.
4,Really fun,"I love Jayne Castle/Ann Krentz's futuristic world and this was no exception. Very fun and the play between characters is something I really enjoy. I do wish she would do more of her flower series (i.e. Amaryllis, Zinnia, Orchid)"
4,Unsure. . .at first.,"I was at first very hesitant to buy Ghost Hunter. For the last couple of years it seems to me that J.A.K. has been hit and miss. But, I broke down and bought the book since I loved the previous Jayne Castle books. I ended up enjoying the book emensely and didn't regret buying it. While it's not her best book it was good."
2,Oh Noooooooooooo.....,"I love Mozart. If you love Mozart, you're not going to be paticularly happy with this. The plot has been revised, the songs are irritating, and Papageno is a giant chicken! I keep waiting for him to break out into the Chicken Dance with Papagena. Still, I rated this two stars instead of just one for the same reason I was kind to another animated opera, ""The Gentlemen of Titipu"", based more or less on ""The Mikado"". Such films do appeal to children, and it may offer them their very first introduction to such classics. But that's about all the good I can say. Everyone else can view it once as a curiosity, if they choose, but it isn't a repeater, and you may have trouble getting through it even once."
1,not very interesting,Neither my husband nor I found the words/stories included in this book to be very interesting. Try Phil Cousineau's Wordcatcher for a much more entertaining and enlightening read.
5,Its about time,I finally have read a book that works with my lifestyle and thought process. No longer is pumping iron the recommended exercise regime for someone over 40. Fabulous book. Great section on diet as well. Thanks.
5,This book has changed my life!,"I am a woman living in Manhattan and for something I can do on the road or in my house, this book is amazing. For 40-something, I look and feel better than I did twenty years ago! Highly recommended."
5,The best system for anyone and everyone.,"I have been working out with Marv Marinovich for four years. I am a college football player and I can honestly say that the exercises that I have done (they were directly put into the book) have gotten me into the best shape of my life. Not only that, I have seen people from seven year-olds to sixty year-olds do the exercises and achieve their desired results.(They were naturally different from a college football player's) I hope everyone would get a chance to read the book and do the exercises in conjunction with the diet. If they did, I am positive that they would see the results they desired from a work out program. I know I did."
5,This line of books is incredibly organized and helpful,"As I wrote in another review of the Verb book by Bescherelle, this line of books is incredibly organized and full of information. Whether you are a beginner or experienced, you will gain a lot from what this book offers. Everything is 100% in French, and is organized into several helpful categories and sub categories. You can't go wrong."
5,it's an awesome item,"I like it. Every page is clear and well made. The cover is strong a durable for sure. Easy to understand and it comes with some french grammar explanations. Just in case, its all in french so don't expect to find any english in it"
3,Delivering delay,"Dear Amazon team...I don't understand why if I paid $11.99 for a two days delivering, I've been waiting more than a week for this dictionary... I hope it doesn't happen so often.Cheers.Esmeiro Fuenmayor"
5,Serious French students need this book!,"I purchased this book while in France last fall. I also own 501 French verbs, which I love, but this book is great because it helps you conjugate any and all verbs. Plus, it all fits into one neat little volume. It's helpful that the instructions are in French because you learn some good vocabulary as you go along. If you also own Bescherelle La Grammaire and L'orthographe, you have a great French reference selection in a fraction of the space taken up by other books!"
2,Bad thesis but a story that still needs to be looked at,Sugrue takes a look at one of the crisis to hit not only Detroit but the rest of the country in his book on race and inequality. While there have been a lot of disturbing factors that have occurred during urban renewal Sugrue takes his text a little far. His flagrant bashing of urban planning gets old after the first two chapters and the book tends to drag on. This is an important issue that bears further studying but hopefully it will be done in a more academic way. This book does have all the information you need to start studying the subject and is a good way to begin looking at urban renewal.
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this unit at Sears about a year and a half ago and right away found the blade vibration side-to-side was awful. In addition the blower tube did not work. I took the unit back to Sears and they repaired it. The blower tube will remove very light dust if I can get the outlet close enough to the material but that is as good as it gets. The blade movement is still the same and Sears says there is nothing they can do about it. I have tried bolting the unit down but that only served to vibrate EVERYTHING else off of the work bench(even an impact wrench). I can make pretty good cuts on soft wood up to 1/2 inch or hardwood up to 1/4 but thats it. Try anything more and the blade wanders all over the place no matter how it is tensioned. Maybe I just got a lemon but I have yet to have a good experience with anything in the ""shopmaster"" line."
2,Poor design????,Very interesting to find the same problem in Gainesville. The little saw worked great until it tip of the upper arm broke and ate the rubber mount below the arm. I wouldn't have been so disappointed given the low price but it was almost new.
3,surprised to see others,"Wow i am surprised to see 2 other people who had the exact same problem I had. The saw worked great for the price for about 4 months of light use, then without warning the upper arm assembly snapped. Its going to cost about $25 for the parts. I dont know if its worth it. It is sad to see Delta go this direction after so many years of good tools."
2,It's cheap for a reason.,"I bought this model from Lowe's a year ago. It's a pretty simple machine, easy to use, and is great for small, detailed work.I had some problems with it, though. First of all, the ""quiet, less vibration"" thing is true... if you're comparing it to a large chainsaw. And second, it broke! The tip of the cast-iron top arm piece actually snapped off while cutting, which lets the whole blade-holding section swivel up. It seems to me that this design was not very well thought out. Hopefully I just got a bad one."
2,What a lemon,"I just picked this saw up 2 nights ago. Assembly was fairly simple and the price was right at $79. Before I ever even tried to fire it up, the lower nut that holds the bottom of the blade snapped in half while tighenting it. I replaced it with a wing nut temporarily. When I finally turned the saw on the blade speed was wandering all over the place. I turned the speed all the way down and tried again, but the same thing keeps happening. It will start out slow then jump to full speed, back and forth. I normally am very happy with Delta but this thing is a pile of garbage. Back to the store with it."
1,Cheap Canadian Import - Avoid at all Cost!,"This is what happens when we import products.This is 1950's technology, that's why it's $59 at Lowes. It takes 1 hour to change the blades. The tension control came unscrewed and would not go back in when changing the last blade. This piece of junk is going back to Lowes.CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP! Don't buy imports."
4,good machine for intro to scroll saws,"for the little i use a scroll saw, i couldnt see dropping too much money. so i jumped when this baby went on sale. i am not dissapointed with my purchase. it has a nice big cast iron top. it vibrates a little, but not enough to complain about. i havent cut anything wider than 3/4, but i wouldnt be afraid to try it. with the appropriate feed rate, i dont see a problem with this machine handling most anything you could through at it. just remember, you get what you pay for. if you want zero vibration, more bells and whistles, etc, yes you will have to spend more. but this is a good machine for the money"
4,Great value,"I am a professional scroll sawyer and I use my Delta every day. It has proven to be a real work horse. A few things broke on it after a couple months of constant use but I was easily able to get replacement parts either at Big Orange or Sears. I feel that an expensive saw will not replace skill at using it. Save some money and buy this saw, anchor it to a bench and you will be happy. A Hegner cost $1,000!! and is not 10 times better than this saw. This is a great value!!! Great for fretwork."
2,Dissapointing alignment.,"When I started putting this saw together I was impressed with the heftyness of the unit. Unfortunately as the blade moves up and down it moves side to side (perpendicular to the direction of cut.) Calling Delta's toll free line yielded an explination on how to tension the blade, which is not what I was trying to do, I'm not even sure if the person helping fully understood the difference between a scroll saw and a band saw. The unit is so simple there is no way to adjust for arm misalignment. In addition, to get the table 90 degrees to the blade the table must be tilted 2-3 degrees relative to the workbench (works to get a 90 degree cut but does not sit well with me.) Now I have to decide weather to try another one or shop around. Good Luck."
3,entry level saw,I don't have much experience with scroll saw but this one is not for serious scroll saw work. Good for just light duty and not very intricated work.
4,A must have if you're building a Pontiac.,"The title says it all.Well written and up to date, a must have for any Pontiac fans library.Jim Hand is THE Pontiac guy and this book has a wealth of his knowledge in it. He's also very friendly & willing to help out pretty much anyone looking for more detailed information. Do a search & I'm sure that you can find out where he and all the other Pontiac guru's hang out on the net. Hint: try PerformanceYearsAND BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,Don't buy for head portin,I bought this book for porting my heads. I thought this book was ok at best. The pictures are terrible and is worded very confusing for a complete novice. I heard he has videos and would suggest those instead. I did everything I thought seemed good brought it to a cylinder head place and they say I underported it...after 40hrs of grinding... I am a butler fan but don't buy this for head porting.
5,Very good info,"Very good book for getting info about Pontiac engines. Lots of pointers and tips on heads, blocks and cam specs."
3,"It's ok, but not if your restoring or trying to do repairs.","I was kind of disappointed in this book. This was recommended to me and I thought, this would be great so my husband could look things and troubleshoot problems.It was more of the history of the engine. Very limited details for instructions on ""how to"".If you looking for a more hands on book, I would not recommend this."
5,excellent book,"Well written book by a real Pontiac professional. Good info for various levels of performance. Most tech manuals I simply read the section that concerns me at the moment, this one I read cover to cover.Book came highly recommended on several Pontiac performance forums and lived up to my expectations and more. Highly recommended for anyone with questions about basic Pontiac performance to advanced modifications."
1,"Failure prone, obsolete","We have a house full of these, and they fail regularly (the grease inside oozes out onto our cabinets, and the seal is lost).If you're stuck with these, contact Blum directly, and they will replace your failed units with new ones. They will fail too, but it's better than paying to replace defective units."
3,"Adequate, but not great","I installed these with the adapter for face frames on the kitchen cabinet doors that were too narrow to install theBlumotion Hinge Adapter, Compact(which I have installed on the rest of the cabinet doors). While the inserts do prevent the doors from slamming shut, the major disadvantage is that they don't engage until the door is almost closed. This means that either you have to release the door, or else your fingers get caught.I much prefer the version for Compact Hinges that installs on the hinge side. This way, you can feel the mechanism engage before you release the door."
2,Just fine,"A fine book, but not as finely-tuned as Baking with Julia, The Essential Baker, or The Breadmaker's Apprentice. I recommend either of those (or all) above this."
1,Not for beginners or advanced,"Having baked steadily for 30 years, I am exceptionally disappointed in this book. I have yet to have any recipe turn out despite following the directions and living at normal altitude."
5,"Easy to follow, impeccably perfect recipes","After seeing Mr. Malgieri on the Food Network, I waited quite some time to obtain this book...and I wish I hadn't. The recipes are perfectly detailed and easy to follow. Many of them tell you how to mix the ingredients three different ways: by hand, with a heavy-duty mixer or with a food processor. As a baker for many years, I found myself not only baking with this book, but reading it, too. It is finely detailed and contains many hints and recipe variations that you won't want to miss. Can't wait to receive my recently ordered Malgieri book, ""Great Italian Dessert."""
3,Well written but Bagel tastes like dog biscuits,"This book is well written and has enough details on instructions to fully explain and instruct the baker. But, if this is true, then the bagel recipe was a miss. Maybe it's because I don't live in NY, but then maybe these bagels are suppose to be like the city. . .tough. At least my dog liked them. It still took him 30 minutes to chew through one and he weighs 105 lbs. I think the author's strength is in his pastry, pies and cakes. They do look authentic and wonderful."
1,The Years Before AC/DC,"Don't waste your money. I read other reviews after purchasing this item. All it contains is three early songs by Bon Scott with an image of Angus Young playing guitar. Note: Bon Scott was with another band or solo when he recorded these early songs. Your better off just buying a CD with his music. Also, this DVD doesn't not play in just any DVD it has to be adaptable to play it. Don't bother unless you plan to return it!"
2,Davis Spends Most of the Book Trying to Defend His War Actions...,"As a 17 year member of a Civil War Round Table I've read very many first hand accounts and auto biographies from the Civil War era. This is one of the worst...or perhaps more accurately, one of the most boring ones I've read yet. Confederate President Jefferson Davis spends the majority of his book attempting to defend all of his political actions & war actions and the actions of the south and the Confederate military. He repeats himself quite a bit. (I felt while reading it that the main person he was attempting to convince was....himself!) Maybe it would have been more interesting if it hadnt been so darn long, as that made it quite boring. I could see this book coming into good use though for a college student electing to read it for a term paper. Otherwise dont waste your time."
4,A great book with unforgettable characters!,"I enjoyed reading ""Wild Notion."" The story kept me on the edge of my seat--anxious to find out what happened next. I loved Claren and Tanner, as well as Claren's kids, mom, and the menagerie of animals. My favorite scenes were on the porch swing and the scene when Tanner first comes to the ranch and Claren warns him about his language. The book was funny, touching and filled with plenty of plot twists. Nancy Goldberg Levine Author of ""Tempting Jonah"" to be published by Neighborhood Press in March 1999"
4,"Witty, warm story charming enough to keep you turning pages.","In Wild Notions, Cathy McDavid has hit upon a wonderful combination of humor, heat and heart-touching romance. Claren and Tanner are opposites, and yet totally suited, especially when it comes to front porch swings. Mix in the kids, the dogs and a not-quite-approving mother for a humor that is on the right track with reality. Skillfully done, it's a story that keeps the pages turning well past midnight and makes you sigh in satisfaction when you're done. Entertaining, charming and believeable."
4,An intriguing story. Highly recommend it.,"Cathy McDavid tells a believable story about a mother who, in disregarding her instincts and following her child's, rediscovers herself as a woman in the arms of a man with a mysterious past and a dangerous secret---a secret that will threaten all she holds dear. This is a ""one-sitting"" book, as you fall in love with the children, four-year-old Joey is real enough to hug, their wide assortment of extremist pets, and find yourself entangled in the mystery surrounding Tanner. You want to kiss the kids, yell at the animals, and turn the page to follow Claren as she attempts to learn the truth about Tanner, and finds herself an unwilling passenger on a voyage through desperation, discovery, and redemption. A few minor glitches in the printing process stop the fluid pace of this gripping tale, but press on, friends. This story is well worth the effort"
2,cute but a little stiff,"cute shoes and great price, but they're so stiff i don't know if i'll ever wear them. uncomfortable; will take a lot of breaking in, if i can brave it. if you have strong feet, go for it."
4,if you dont own it get it now,"this cd is a pretty tight underground sac town cd, most tracks are very tight, and it features c bo, the best thing about this cd, unlike most cds today, is it is not cluttered with guest apperances, and skits, it is pure music, and just mitch and lemay, this cd is long out of print, and not available anywhere so if there are any listed , cop this cd, nothin but sac town heat"
2,the hubris!,"Ugh. Roger Fishbite left me feeling cheap and used. I can't fathom how in the world this recent wave of authors (Praeger, Pia Pera, etc.) could have such hubris as to ape/parody Nabakov's masterpiece ""Lolita"". I imagine that they would argue that they're giving voice to the voiceless nymphet. But really, after reading several of these novels, in portraying Lucky, Lo, etc. as such charmless little harpies, I can honestly say they sure aren't doing the girls any favors.Praeger is obviously a talented, funny and clever writer, but this was a ridiculous project. I hope to read something else of hers wherein she has not hitched her wagon to someone else's star as she has here with Nabakov."
2,Depth stop unworkable,"As an old woodworker, disappointed that the depth stop mechanism does not work, even when following the written instructions. The spindle travel is very short out of the box, and ours just (without any adjustment) became shorter. The depth control ring and the guage are not intuitive, the guage reading what appears to be backwards. Not up to the old standads of Rockwell/Delta days. Do not buy this model."
3,"Not bad., but not great.","I do wish the table had gooves that were in an ""X"" pattern instead of parallel to each other. The 6"" Delta vise does not fit the DP300 press. Don't expect to move the press to easily,it weighs just under 80 lbs. It was easy to assemble (just have someone available to help). The head weighs a lot and when you lift it to place on the column, its nice to have some help. The depth stop DOES NOT WORK like it says in the manual!! It is hard to figure out. I hope it lasts awhile. The tool tray does not fasten to the press as shown on the box. It goes at the top of the raising rack and is to high. The goose ncek lamp is great."
4,good small drill press,"This is a nice small drill press, runs nice and is quiet to run and works well, one thing that I found out is that the tool rest if you put it on as directed you cannot pivot the table off to the side. I cut the bracket down a litte shorter and put it above the top ring and this works well. The only other thing is the depth stop is not as positive stop as on a Craftsman bench top otherwise it is a good unit."
3,Straightforward accounts,"These are straightforward accounts of some of the Pinkertons' most famous cases. It isn't super exciting, but it is interesting to see how the detectives went about trying to solve the cases including usually many months of undercover work."
3,Fairly good reading.,"Being a nonfiction lover, this book is alright to read. It is a little longer in description than necessary, but not bad for the timeframe."
4,Very loud,"I have had this planer for two years. It is very easy to change the blades and they are two sided and can flip them around when one side dulls. It works great. I wished I had the money to buy a 15"" model with an induction motor. This tool is very loud and does get hot to the touch. It does a great job and snipe is minimal. It comes with an infeed and outfeed table. This is extra on the Dewalt model. I highly recommend getting the 4"" dust chute. I wished the chip/dust chute was angled to the side. This would help tremendously with guiding my 4"" dust hose away from the exiting stock."
4,Great for Price,"I picked this planer up for about $270 with free shipping. For the price and low to moderate usage, it can't be beat. Relatively little snipe. I have had trouble on occassion with feeding, but it has only been on very thing starting pieces (1/4"" inch). Thicker lumber hasn't been a problem at all. If you looking for an industrial, stationary planer, this isn't it. If you're looking to plane a few board feet every time you do a project, wait for a sale and jump on it."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"Do not buy the Delta TP400LS 12 1/2"" thickness planer.If only it would feed. If it would feed, it would be a great product. My TP400LS worked well for about four months (low useage, about 50 to 100 lineal ft of board) then suddenly stopped feeding. Having now read other reviews (obviously too late to do me any good) I see that it is a serious problem, one that Delta does not appear to be willing to address. I would not recommend buying this product."
4,Not too bad!!!,"I've used this little planer for over 3 years now. I've ran dozens of different types of wood through it and really have not had a lick of trouble from the machine except that when trying to run the heavy, dense woods through, it sometimes requires a helping hand to push through. I've never had any problems with burning or snipe. Everything was aligned and adjusted out of the box, just unpack, plug in and go. If this machines dies tomorrow, I feel like I've gotten my money's worth from it. But, it's still going strong and is working as well as the day I brought it home. I would recommend it and I would buy it again after 3 years of regular use. I probably would rate this machine at 4 and a half stars, not 5 because of having to help with the infeed of heavier woods...not a big deal at all, just know about."
5,Wes H.,This planer is excellent. It requires virtually no set-up or calibration. It is practically ready to go out of the box. The performance is is outstanding and it is easy to use.
4,Well worth the small investment,"This is my first planer - so I really have nothing to compare it with. Set up was very easy, most time consuming part was assembly of the stand - took about 20 minutes (even at my normal slow pace). The planer itself was a snap - just install the knobs and remove some packing material and you are ready to go.I ran some maple and walnut throught it and was impressed with the finish, smooth as glass. I used a digital caliper to check thickness in several spots on the boards and they were pretty much dead on. The only thing I wish this machine had was some sort of ""final cut"" mechanism, so that you could preset your final dimension and not go any further with the plaining. I guess that is something you would expect on a much more expensive machine. I highly recommedn this planer to any home woodworker."
2,Needs more work,"Take one very talented strangler with an interest in philosophy and his cynical profit-driven manager. Now, put them into a set of loosely connected vignettes and a sprinkling of equally loosely connected fantasy tropes. Mash them together - don't worry about how they fit around the edges - and shamelessly pad out the last third to bring the whole thing up to some reasonable word count. The Philosophical Strangler tries very hard to have the wit and depth of the Discworld novels, and it just doesn't manage it. Still, two stars for some decent puns."
4,Smiled the whole way through,"Ok, based on the other reviews the author appears to either tickle your fancy... or not. I enjoyed the book: light-hearted fare, intelligent humor (gotta love the cat), tongue-in-cheek story line, creative characterization, what's not to like? I for one will be reading more of Eric Flint's fun farcical fiction (apologies for that aside). Thanks Eric!"
3,"Not bad, but not great","There's nothing wrong with this book -- it's just like watching Michael Jordan play with a junior-high team. The execution is fine, but he's not being pushed very hard. The book is fairly funny, but Flint's writing talents go way beyond this, and at times you get the feeling that Flint knows it.I paid full hardcover price for this book, and I wouldn't recommend that others do the same. Get it from the library, or wait for the paperback. It's just not in the same league as Flint's other work."
1,Me next Mr. Strangler,"I struggled to even give this howling dog one star, but upon reflection I realized the ink hadn't stained my fingers. So there you go. It has been said that one must give the devil his due and when he came looking for it I told him I was a little short on due at the moment, but you can have my copy of this book. He said ""I can take a hint mister."" With that he zipped up his jacket, crammed his hat on his head and left the premises. Wait, said I, "" You forgot your book""."
3,A trip to a place worse than,"It is very hard to hold a Shrek like humor for a professional stranglerand his idj't midget manager for over 400 pages.I think Eric Flint could use an editor.The comic novel doesn't lack in inspiration or gut and belly laughs,but just gets old in repeating the same lines again and again.After about the third bug eyed, purple tongued strangling, you tend to lose interest?Inevitably, maybe, the two evil fellows turn heroes and are even more out of place in the world than profiting from death. A satire on middle earth type epics that all in all take themselves too seriously?"
4,Cynical assassins,"Set in medieval times in an unknown realm, similar in tone to Sir Apropos of Nothing. Story of an assassin (the Strangler) and his manager. A bit gruesome in parts, but also includes tales of derring-do and humor. The manager is the narrator and he talks a good game of cynicism, while not thinking too highly of himself."
3,The Dialectic Undone,"I wish I could have given this froth a 3 1/2. This is an amusing book, with amusing characters who are constantly in the midst of amusing mayhem, murdering mostly deserving folk for profit...but it's no more than that. I even laughed out loud a few times...not often, but a few times. Do you understand my problem?This book has a lot of wasted potential. It was like a series of short stories strung together with very thin connecting material. It's a very light weight tale, unfortunately in hardbound, with spotty, but amusing, character development. This wasn't up to Flint's usual standards...but amusing, rather amusing."
1,Check The Screen Shots at DVDBeaver,"I am about to cancel my pre-order of this Blu Ray release. Please check the screen grabs at DVDBeaver. The transfer is obviously INFERIOR to prior DVD releases. I was eagerly awaiting this title, but I am not going to throw away $20. This is a disgrace."
1,"Yes, a Disaster","I loved this film, and waited for its blu-ray release. But this is worse than my least expectations. The format is awful. Aspect ratio awful, because the camera zooms in and cuts out top, bottom, and sides of the original film. How could this happen? Did they assign a couple of kids in a garage to produce this? Awful, truly bad."
4,Good Transfer,This movie has never looked this good on any kind of video.A must buy for fans of this movie.
2,Killer lacks dynamic punch,"Unfortunately this blu-ray reissue falls short on 2 counts. The picture is better than the standard def version but not by much. However the biggest letdown is the awful sound mix. It's in ""mono"" for godsakes !!!!! A picture of this sort screams for a dts master audio or Dolby true HD soundblast. The thin tinny sound renders the picture almost unwatchable. Stick with the criterion edition if you can find it."
1,Another dissapointed fan,I should preface this by saying I dont own this and I will not buy this because I have seen the screenshots at DVDBeaver and they are terrible. What is going on over at Dragon Dynasty? This is really shoddy work - just pure laziness. I was so excited for this. I am a huge fan of the Hong Kong Legends Region 2 DVD which is long out of print and I have even seen the film on the big screen at a reperatory theater (The New Beverly in Los Angeles) and was really looking forward to seeing this. It seems Dragon Dynasty is cutting corners. One other instance is their Supercop release without the original Hong Kong cut. I dont know... it seems like the Weinstein company doesnt actually care about these films and just wants to release them in the cheapest way possible. I bet this is one of the reasons Bey Logan isnt really with the company anymore.
4,"Awesome band, good compilation","I found this band through listening to QOTSA and the things Lanegan did with them. I'm glad I discovered this unique form of grunge rock, if one can call it that. My favorites were disappearing and Traveler. Some of the songs can be a bit bland, but overall this is a great CD."
3,Average Quality -- Better for the Nunchuk than Anything,"Dug the bright color (we got the blue), and the slick, velvety feel of the skin was great! But the thin silicone doesn't last long on the remote (e.g. it repositions itself, is always a bit off around some of the buttons, etc.). However, it works great and is still going strong on the nunchuk controller. Can't complain about the price."
4,tough to get on,Overall its a nice skin. Once you get it on. Very tough to get on then you have to remove half of it to change or charge the batteries. With a little working you can get it on tho.
3,it works,"It works but I was hoping the clear was more actually a transparent clear, this is still a little opaque. I have it on the Tron Wii remote and I wanted something that did not obscure all the neon lighting on it...I've been unsuccessful at finding that. So I gave it 3 stars because I wish ""invisible clear"" meant transparent as I thought.If anyone knows of something that would be useful to me in this case, please comment."
2,"to tight, to much effort ....","The sleeves were too tight to put on the product, and I wound up feeling like I was breaking the controler. I didn't thankfully, and just wound up throwing this out, it wasn't worth the money or effort"
4,E-book is not loanable,This is an excellent book as the previous reviews attest. However I was very disappointed to discover that I am not able to loan the E-book to friends and family. So disappointed that I docked it a whole star.
3,Poor quality,"This video had very poor audio and visual quality at the beginning. The quality improved somewhat as the movie went on, but it was never great."
2,Exaggerated Claims,"The product seller, DANDYLIONBOOKS, claimed this product was in VERY GOOD condition, but in fact it was closer to BELOW AVERAGE CONDITION. The box was torn and jury-rigged with scotch tape and the video was scratched leaving about 5 minutes of the movie lost to something that looks like white noise. The price was very low so I can see why it was in this condition, but falsely claiming it was in very good condition when it was clearly in poor condition is BLATANT FALSE ADVERTISING."
4,Days ByGone,"Well ever since i lost this movie I have been looking for it and just recently I started up my search again and was successful. The reason why i spent all this time trying to find it, is because, as a child I was completely mesmerized by this movie and is definitely worth buying if you like a tale told similiarly to the Arabian Nights books. However it does have pretty retro moments but they are easily overlooked if you are involved in the movie. X_X"
4,Almost Elvis - Lots of Fun - Very Interesting,"This is one fantastic DVD ,loaded to the max with high energy fun and very enjoy able to watch.My wife and I really had a nice evening watching this sweet gem of a movie.The main reason I gave this movie a 4 star rating is only because the really Elvis deserves 5 stars.SEveral of the Elvis impersonators where very good.And a few of the others were not....would I dare say as good.....but it was very interesting and fun to see how far someone would go to become Elvis.And for my money the man who won was the best.I would like to say though that there is a Gospel singer and guitar player named Greg Williams in Fresno Calif ,at The Open Door Ministries ,who has never competed....but has far more talent than these gentlemen.So I guess you'll never really hear the best.....but the film was fun"
3,Almost something.,"This is an interesting documentary. We follow three (we see and hear from many more) impersonators trying to get their chance to go to Memphis and become the 1999 Images of Elvis winner. It's strange to see the lengths some of these guys will go to trying to look and sing like E. We get to see impersonators from all over the world, Japan, Belgium; there are black Elvis', women Elvis', and young and old kings. In the deleted scene section we even meet the political correct Elvis. I was very disappointed in the presentation of the disc. It should have been presented in a wide screen format. Some of the information about the people like their names, places, or just general information about an event you can either barely read or you can't even make it out. It was like we were zoomed in to far on the picture. Anyway if you love Elvis Aron Presley or you just want a good chuckle check it out. Then rent Elvis: That's the way it is and check out the real thing."
2,Funny but not helpful,"I was looking for something that would help me to better understand my left-handed son, but this book was full of one-liners and useless facts."
3,Prelude to a Masterpiece,"The extended version of Sam Peckinpah's flawed Civil War epic is an improvement over the muddled theatrical cut. However, ""Major Dundee"" should be viewed as a warm-up to the maverick filmmaker's 1969 masterpiece, ""The Wild Bunch."" Despite the undeniable brilliance of several individual sequences (such as the colorful Mexican fiesta), this overly ambitious production never coheres into a satisfying whole. Still, there is much to admire - including a fine ensemble cast headed by Charlton Heston and the impressive cinematography of Sam Leavitt. Even if Peckinpah had secured his creative autonomy, one senses that ""Major Dundee"" would remain a fascinating misfire."
4,Unusual Western/War film,"Finally! All that has been out there are terrible full screen versions on the Encore - Western channel! This film deserves a second look. Union and Confedarates join forces to go after either bandits or indians (don't remember which!) in Mexico.Not sure what the extended version contains, but I'm very happy it's arriving! Now all we need is ""55 Days at Peking""."
3,"We'll never have the true film , so this will have to do","It was a shame that Sam Peckinpah was interfered with in the making of this film , but at least this release goes some way toward making an effort to honestly show what he had in mind .It is a good action film with solid acting and worthwhile special features which highlight the fact that this film should not be forgotten .Any film student should have this DVD .Recommended ."
4,"Good, but the music is a disappointment","In general I agree with the majority of the very positive reviews for the extended version. However, like at least one other writer I dissent on the evaluation of the new soundtrack. The original was a bit cheesy (I was always especially irked by those synthesized-sounding transitional dramatic cues), to be sure, but it was also more dramatic and much more true to the time and style in which the film was made. The almost Celtic-sounding aspects of the new score seem very out-of-place. Having seen the original many times, and having enjoyed it, despite its flaws, as a piece of film history with a very unusual storyline, I very much missed the original score while viewing this version."
3,Better history than you might think,"One reviewer asserted that the plot of this movie has absolutely no basis in historical fact. Whether the US Army used Conferate prisoners to fight Apaches, I don't know, but it is a fact that the Army used CSA POWs to fight the Plains Indians. Do a Google search on the term ""galvanized Yankees"" for more information."
5,Restoration makes a big difference,"The restored and expanded Major Dundee starring Charleton Heston is a must for Western fans. This version far exceeds the original cut (butchered by the studio) that was offered to theaters in 1964. The film has also been re-scored beautifully. If you have seen this one on TV and hated it, please revisit the film."
4,A great guy movie.,"This is not the best movie or even the best Western movie, but it is a great guy movie. It sticks fairly close to historical accuracy, it has great conflict situations between the Yankees,the Rebels, the Apaches and then even the French.The rivalry between Charleton Heston and Richard Harris is greater than what is shown on camera. The battle scenes are excellent. This is a great guy movie."
2,It may be a fine comentary on the futility of war but it makes for a less than satisfying entertainment.,It's hard to tell what might have been without the reportedly significant studio editing and tampering with Peckinpah's movie. It would probably have been better. I doubt that it would have been great. There are some good scenes and good performances but overall the movie just drags along and then peters out at the end. It may be a fine comentary on the futility of war but it makes for a less than satisfying entertainment.
2,"Dated, Not well written, poor editing","There are a number of excellent actors in this movie, but the plot is jumbled, the editing it ragged, and the music needs to just not be there. This is a classic western, but it requires patience to watch it all the way through."
3,Major Dundee / Major disappointment!,This is in my opinion the worst Peckinpah movie ever! The casting was wonderful but the story just dragged on and on and then had a very anticlimactic ending! Even with Heston this was a relatively boring movie.
5,very satisfied,I am very satisfied with the dvd movie Major Dundee. It was well worth the money. Very enjoyable.
4,A Peckinpah Film,"The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is the length of the movie with a slow middle. Sam Pechinpaw movies are always action packed. Heston plays a tought Major who's only purpose was to hunt down some murdering Apaches, but falls in love along the way."
2,MAMA Mia!!,"If you like depressing ghettoism-- This would be the book to read. This lady (Mildred) was not strong- Harriet Tubman was strong, Coretta Scott King was strong, Fannie Mae Smith was strong. . . I could go on, but I'll stop there. Mildred was a weak drunk, who did a terrible job of taking care of her kids. To those considering buying this book- DON'T check it out from the library."
2,"well written but, ...","I would first have to definitely give Ms. McMillan her props on a well written book; however, it was quite unrealistic. As a well read college student, I have experienced many ""flat"" characters and ""deep"" ones too. .... These were positively the FLAT ones! I merely finished the book in hopes that each character would gain some depth. Not so bad, yet not so good either!"
4,Mama,"'Mama' is a very nice book to read because it emphasize on poverty and other relationship dilemmas. This could be the story of your sister, cousin, or mother. It is the tale of a true womans defeat against the battles of sex, money, liquor, and children (life). Enjoyed book. Great Job"
4,Where Is The Rest Of The Story??,"""Mama"" held my interest. I love Terry McMillian's storytelling skills. She's creative and wrote an unpredictable novel. The novel was realistic and I could relate to the story about some of the things that happened in my childhood. I was cheering for the family and was glad that they were turning their life around until the story ended abruptly. ""Mama"" gets 4 stars because of the abrupt ending. It needed a least a few more chapters or epilogue to bring the novel to full circle.Overall rating: 4.0 stars."
4,Enjoyable Read,Characters weren't particularly likable but you will want to keep reading just to find out what happens.
5,One of the best books ever written!!!,"This book has been read by me, for four years straight, every summer!!! This book is just like the relationship with me and my moteher. I thought that Mildred's action and thoughts on how to raise and love her children were mirror-like compared to the relationships of those today! THis is a page-turner from beginning to end! Read and enjoy!"
5,Brilliant!,This is the first book I read by Terry Mcmillan and it definitely made me anticipate all the other books that followed. She is one of the best writers ever. If youve read the other books and havent read this one you are definitely missing out!
5,It WaS dA bOmB,"This book was a very detailed and clarified representation of one woman's struggle to keep herself sane during a time where her and her family are dealing with depression,abandonment,and lonliness.Terry McMillan writes this book with such emotion and empathy you can almost feel the pain that the woman is exposed to through the pages of the book.A Must Read!"
5,Mama is a great book!,"Terry McMillan did a good job on Mama. This is one of the first books I read from her. She portrays the story very well. And also being black myself I can see what they were going through. Mama has some points in it that make this book important. The family goes through many trials. And after you get in to it, it is hard to put down. And some of the things that they go through is very emotional because I can see from that point of view. Good job Terry!"
5,great,"this author writes great books, and grasp the audience as if she is sitting next to you telling her story."
4,"mama, mama, mama!!","i read this book when i was 16 (about 6 yrs ago) and i remember the impact it had on me. i was in awe of this strong, black woman, a lot of young black ladies (like myself) can relate to her because our mothers were the same way. this was excellent for terry's first novel. it couldn't have been any better!! a difinite classic! go pick it up!"
4,Unforgettable Mama,I must say I found this book to be very enjoyable and quite a page turner. There were times I found myself both laughing out loud and weeping. This book can run the emotions. I highly recommend it as a great alternative to watching television.
3,"decent read, but...","i just read mama. an interesting read; good way to spend my sunday afternoon. i'm a little confused, though, by the timeline. best i can tell, the story opens in 1964. in just a few years, a reference is made to ""the price is right"" which didn't debut until 1971. also, someone eats a kit-kat candy bar which wasn't introduced into the market until 1969. what up wit dat?"
5,"DEEP, AND DOWNRIGHT FUNNY","I HAVE READ EVERYTHING YOU WROTE, AND ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE NEVER CEASED TO AMAZE ME. I READ IT OVER AND OVER, MILDRED DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE AND TO FEED HER CHILDREN, HER DAUG HTERS SORT OF FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS, HER SON IS ANOTHER DIFFERENT STORY, I LOVED THE BOOK BECAUSE TERRY DID NOT BOTHER TO SUGAR COAT LIFE THE IT IS SOMETIMES. MEN DO COME AND GO, BUT IT IS STRANGE HOW SOMETIMES WE NEED SOMEBODY THERE FOR CONVIENCE.YOU GO ON TERRY WITH YOUR BAD SELF. I HOPE MAMA MAKES IT TO THE BIG SCREEN"
4,She loved it!,"Nothing expensive, but it's well made and looks great. My wife still wears this from time to time."
2,A Persian Let down,"If you are just beginning to learn the Persian language this book is not for you. The book is written in the Persian language without the English letter translation. The Persian print is also very hard to read and decipher. It also lacks a Persian alphebet for the user. If you know Persian and can read Persian, then this book would be great for you."
2,Who The Heck Is Writing These Comments ?,"If it's a Persian dictionary, of course the Persian words are going to be in Persian script. It's the same with the dictionaries of any other language, duh. Please no more entries by people who have been studying Persian for two days ... learn the script, at most it will take you a couple of hours. There are generally about three factors that comprise a good Persian dictionary: it includes some form of phonetic representation of the word, verbs need to be shown with their present tense roots, and examples of usage (with an emphasis on the use of prepositions and also commonly found idioms). This particular dictionary doesn't seem to give you any of these three. If you want a good dictionary stick to the 40-dollar Aryanpur volume. It makes all of the competitors look like crap."
5,Like a Farsi Webster's,"This dictionary likely has more than you need, unless you happen to be a professional translator of Farsi and/or English, but it is miles ahead of the other dictionaries, which tend to contain too little. Please note, however, that this book is one half of a two volume set. The companion volume is the Hippocrene Standard Dictionary: Farsi (Persian) - English Dictionary, also by S. Haim. By Webster's, I am referring to the quality of the dictionary, rather than any definitions, which, to be clear, are not here, only translations."
3,Great for Persians,"I am learning Farsi--I don't speak Farsi. The dictionary appears to be made for the Persian speaker who needs to check the meaning of an English word. None of the short vowels are marked--so the student must guess at the correct pronunciation. My Iranian friends love this dictionary, but it is not very helpful to me. The best dictionaries for the student are: 1. Persian-English, English-Persian Learner's Dictionary which contains the Farsi script, transliterations and the present tense verb stems and 2. An English Persian Dictionary by Gilani--very large vocabulary with Farsi and transliterations but no present tense verb stems and ""one-way"" only. It has no Persian to English. I have all of the above and seldom use the one by Haim."
3,"Good for advanced, not beginners",This is a very thorough dictionary in terms of scope.The English words include pronuciation guides while the Persian words do not.The print is so small that some of the letters blur and are difficult to distinguish. A couple have actually been rubbed in the production process so I can't figure them out without the help of a native speaker.It is necessary to read the included key/explanations in the beginning in order to follow the organization.Conjugation is not (at least in my observation) thoroughly included/covered.
4,Mother of a 3 and 4 yr old girls,Both my girls loved this toy. I needed something to keep them busy when I went out of town and I bought this toy and they spent hours playing together with this set. What I like most about it is all the stuff that comes with it fits inside of it and it is easy for them to clean up on their own.
3,Mom of 4 yr. old girl,"I purchased this for my 4 yr old for a Christmas present and have not given it to her yet. I opened it and took everything out to check out the quality and see how easy (or hard) it would be to dress the dolls. I'm giving this product only 3 stars for the following reasons:1) The dolls are not very attractive, but I'm not sure if my daughter will care or not.2) Some of the clothes did not stay on (the front and back are supposed to clip together).But even with these faults the set looks like fun. There are a ton of pieces and I think they all fit into the box so you can fold it all up and take to grandma's, etc. My daughter is really into the whole princess thing right now, so I think with the book and all of the pieces she will enjoy playing with it. The overall quality (remember we have not really played with it yet) seems pretty good."
5,"Excellent transaction, fast delivery, item as described. I would deal again. Many thanks.","Great performance, with an excellent audio-video quality. Abbado's now probably the best conductor in the world!!"
4,"Fine it is for sure, but wait for the Lucerne 9th","As others have said, no doubt this is a great performance but...as good as it is it doesn't hold a candle to the Lucerne Festival recordings standard. I think this could be due to the recording itself too: its balance doesn't sound great to my ears, strings seem to be placed very forward compared to the rest of the orchestra (which lacks in impact), the sound lacks ambience, at least when listened 2-channels.I'm quite sure this will be deleted once the Lucerne Ninth comes out (will be recorded at this year's Festival, will be released on 2011). You won't get disappointed with this DVD, but if you're aiming for an Abbado Ninth and you can wait I would suggest to wait for the Lucerne release. Should he keep the standard he kept since 2003, that should be a Ninth for the ages (I'll be there, btw)..."
3,Hit and Miss Final Season,"This is the only season of ER that I didn't snatch up as soon as it became available on DVD. Now it's a few months after my purchase and I still haven't watched the DVDs. The final season of ER had some highlights, but just never really hit the mark for me. Guest appearances by former cast members seemed too contrived, but a few other character arcs felt just right. Most of all, I still don't see why it was necessary to kill off Dr. Pratt. All in all, it's still my favorite television show (tied with Breaking Bad)."
5,ER: Season 15,"Every Christmas I buy a season of ER for my sister and every year she's happy to see them under the tree. I used to get them at the store, but that way I only got her one at a time due to price limits set, through Amazon, I'm able to get her at least two a year!"
5,Wonderful ending to a wonderful show,ER is one of my favorite shows. I recently started watching through the entire series and it is unique that a drama can make you both laugh and cry
3,.,Interesting introductory text. A less qualitative (more in depth) approach on some chapters would have helped a lot.
5,FRENCH REGGAE IN THE HOUSE!!!!,"Wow! Excellent album!. This cd is mostly Reggae, dance songs, with some rap. Lyrics are well written and beautiful. top songs are ""Le Bilan"", ""Personne"", ""Quitter Son Pays"", as well as the rap song ""Faut k'ca saigne"", with Fonky Family rappers Sat and Menzo. Even if you dont understand French, if you love Reggae, this album is a must. I highly recommend it.Any comments on French music, please e-mail me"
5,New GI Joe connects our grandsons with their deployed dad,My son is in the US Army in Afghanistan. I found his old GI Joes and his sons got interested in playing with them. I was so glad to find out that the new 25th anniversary ones are coming out again. The boys are having fun with my son by email and messenger to talk about old and new GI Joe play.
4,Knowing is half the battle,"This action figure is more a piece of nostalgia than something I play with. It sits on the shelf still in it's unopened container.Snake-Eyes was my favorite GIJoe character, and as cheesy as it sounds looking at it reminds me of hours inventing stories with my best friend when we were kids setting up our GIJoe and Cobra figures in his sandbox bringing our battles to life...good times!"
5,great memories,"Snake Eyes was by far the best toy I ever owned, and probably the hardest to find. I don't collect toys, but when I saw this one I had to buy it immediately. I haven't taken him out of the package, but I can tell by looking that he would stay together if I were weird and played with toys."
3,JR 10X Transmitter Battery,Amazon has a good price and delivery time for this battery that is required to operate a radio controlled aircraft transmitter.
5,Horns...who needs them?!,"Bobby Timmons one of the prime leaders of the soul jazz era wrote some of the finest pieces in that era, such as Dat Dere, This Here, and Moanin'. Most people only know of Bobby Timmons as a sideman Most people only know of Moanin' in the setting of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. Same as Dat Dere. This Here was written for Cannonball Adderley's Quintet, which Bobby was in, in San Francisco. But hey when you have a pianist like Bobby Timmons who needs those horns any way? This album demonstrates Bobby's talents to the full from standards and ballads like Lush Life to My Funny Valentine to his awesome pieces Dat Dere, Moanin', and This Here. This album truly shows Bobby, one of the finest soul jazz pianists, as a leader not a sideman and at his prime. Any one familiar with Dat Dere, Moanin', or This Here should definitely check this album out."
3,Pleasant also-ran by a great sideman,"I've always been respectful of Bobby Timmons as a sideman--he's a versatile and virile pianist who always has something to say and says it cleanly. This trio album (with one piano solo piece, a throwaway) perhaps shows his weakness as a leader; he's very fluent but not very subtle. The disc is most interesting for two of Timmons's excellent originals, ""Moanin'"" and ""Dat Dere."" The only trouble is, ""Moanin'"" is much better rendered in the classic version on the Art Blakey album of the same name (on which Timmons plays), and ""Dat Dere"" was given its most transcendent cover (that I know of, anyway) by Rickie Lee Jones on the faux-lounge album ""Pop Pop."" They're both great pieces. Anyway, this is a pleasant listen and not a bad disc to have, but it's not essential (in my opinion) and I wouldn't recommend it unless you have some special interest in this pianist."
4,Delta Dp 250,"First time buyer on Amazom. Great price, no tax, free delevery and I received the item eariler than expected. The unit was a bit heavier then I expected. Two areas that could be improved on are, there isn't a place to hold the chuck key. That would appear to be a simple task for Delta to incorporate into the design. The handle that raises the table could have been placed on an angle so as to not be so close the table. If one wants to increase the work surface area with a peice of plywood, you must provide a cutout for the elavation handle.Other than that it appears to be a sturdy machine"
2,my biggest mistake,"I purchased this Sony camcorder assuming that it is the best non-digital available. Picture quality is poor. My old VHS full tape Samsung camcorder delivers a much better picture quality. I complained to a Sony authorized center in Michigan, with no hope. I'm so sad for the non-repeatable moments (graduation party and two trips) that I captured using this poor quality camcorder. I wrote an email to Sony's customer service, and did not receive a response yet.The camera has a sharp LCD, nice features, excellent sound recordingand night shot."
4,for the money its a pretty good camcoder,"i just got this camcoder yesterday. its got some pretty cool features. the picture quality is great except for when i use the digital zoom the picture does get a little bit grainy. so far its the only flaw i saw in the camera. the camera looks great, its not bulky, very light weight. also if you get this camera you might want to get an extra battery too. the two hour one tha it comes with isnt enough.if your a novice video user like myself, i think the sony trv-67 is a good way to go. i only plan on useing it for vacations, birthdays and other everyday use. so its perfect for me. i spent months looking a diffrent cameras and for the price (under $600) it was the best camera out there."
1,Stay away from this camera!!!,"When I purchased this camera, I thought it was great. I thought that Sony cameras were the best you could buy. I used the camera only a handfull of times, then it wouldn't accept tapes any longer. I brought it to a certified sony service shop, paid [amt] to have it fixed. I used it 2 or 3 times over the next few months, and it now has the same problem and sony wants another [amt] to fix it! STAY AWAY!!!"
2,Do Not Purchase a SONY!!!,"What is wrong with the door mechanism??? I have had mine serviced (and payed for labor) TWICE for the same problem. two weeks after th second repair it stopped loading the tape again. Everything else still works, but what good is it to not be able to record or view tapes on it. I stoped throwing money at SONY, for this product. Next one I buy will be a different brand."
4,An Excellent Book for Young Writers,"This charming little book offers a solid, user-friendly introduction to the fundamental steps of the writing process. Fletcher uses a clear and simple prose style to lead young readers through the creative writing process, from generating an idea and writing the first draft, to rereading and revising, to proofreading, editing, and publishing. Along the way, he discusses the importance of finding a suitable place to write, strategies for brainstorming, and methods of overcoming writer's block. Also included are several author interviews to provide alternative approaches to the writing process as well as a bibliography of recommended fiction and writing-related nonfiction. Beginning writers of any age may find inspiration in the practical strategies and encouraging sentiments set forth in this simple but elegant guide."
5,How Writers Work: Finding a Process That works for you,Very Good Book to read and I would recommend this to all educators and anyone who is think about becoming an educator.
4,Simple First Steps,This book gave a simple introduction to the world of writing for young readers. Fletcher described many different tactics that authors use and how you as a writer may begin to implement them. He includes writings from other authors on the subject as well. Great book to use in the classroom with young writers.
4,"A Secretly Good Film, often forgotten but worth a watch","Ever wondered what would happen if you told someone how you felt only to not sign the letter? A string of romantic comedies and love triangles and confusion results when a secret admirer letter is misplaced. It's a surprise that this flick is quite well written and well cast. The happy ending is exactly what you want. Instead of running away for a year on a plane the real sweetheart is about to sail away on a ship having won a ""Year at Sea"" highschool scholarship. When both admirer and admired jump ship it's an adorable finale to so much romantic comedy and misinterpretations!"
5,Just great!!!,"Two of my favourite actors are in this movie Thomas C. Howell and Lori Loughlin.. i just love this movie from the time i actually was a teenager and watching it on TV. The mix ups in the movie of the love letter and the parents just assuming it was for them at different scenes in the movie. The comedy content is enjoyable and the characters very entertaining and loveable. Michael the lead character was so blinded by what he thought was wonderful, which infact wasnt. He had someone wonderful, loving and caring in the form of his best friend Toni and could not see how lucky he was. It took the him a while to figure it out and realize what a huge mistake he had made going for the blonde, popular girl of the school played by Kelly Preston.An enjoyable movie i really recommend this to anyone who loves comedy, romance and fun in their lives."
5,Secret Admirer,Secret Admirer is the best movie i have ever seen. It is very good. C Thomas Howell stars in it and he is a fabulous actor. He is gr8t! I love him! His best friend is in love with him and he doesn't even know it. She writes him a love letter on the last dat of school and puts it in his locker. he thinks this other girl wrote it to him who is has a crish on. he writes that girl debbie a letter and gives it to his best friend to give to her for him but he doesn't sign the letter. she reads it before she gives it to her and its a good thing she does because it stinks. she writes a better letter and dbbie falls in love with them all. but in the mean time debbie's and Michael's (C Thomas Howell) parenst find htese letters and think they are for them to find out what happens please buy this movie and watch it... it's gr8t! hope u love it as much as i do...
5,amazingly,a good sound in vocal jazz ..astonishing jazz with Aura - she performed with big Duke Ellington back in 1972 . how come ? just listen the sample . she one of the best jazz singer of all time . where is she from ? you're not going to belive that!!! Romania
1,Don't waste your money!,"Without a doubt the biggest piece of junk I've ever owned. At 13000 rpm it is to slow for most router bits, but does not have enough power to do a good job with a big bit. The table is too small and has razor sharp edges. The fence is a joke so is the height adjustment. I actually smiled the day it went up in smoke while running a 1/4"" slotcutter because I knew I could toss it and build a real router table, which I did with a makita 3612c plunge router. I am now quite pleased. I should have done this in the first place."
2,Know what you're getting into,"I bought this device with a very specific single purpose in mind, and was able to make it work with a LOT of effort. I wanted to do tongue-and-groove on some long cedar boards for paneling, and after a lot of futzing was able to make acceptable joints on all my boards. It was cheaper than a good router and table would have been.That having been said, this is neither a router table NOR a shaper, and combines the WORST of both. The fence adjustment stinks, ditto the height adjustment (see other reviews). The hole in the top won't accept wide bits, so I had to use a spacer board to get my planks to the right cutting height, which is why I had no problems with the sharp edges on the tabletop snagging my workpiece. The extension table accesory requires the removal of the fence and dust collection port. The single speed is too slow for small bits and too fast for big ones. This is not a very adaptable or flexible machine. Buy a router and table."
1,You'll be sorry you spent the money,"I used (not much) one of these for about a year in my home workshop. There is NOTHING good that I can say about it, except that the motor did actually run.Notes:- Lack of power, single speed, bogs down under load- BAD BAD BAD Fence adjustment. You just can't get it set accurately. Can you say snipe?- Poor height adjustment, but it can be done.- Table top is sharp and rough, which makes feeding your material difficult and unsafe.- No place for featherboards on the fence- Single speed too fast for big bits, too slow for small ones- The use of this machine will lead to a near terminal case of frustration.For a hundred dollars more you can buy a Rousseau router plate, Bosch 1715EVS router, build your own table, Incra Ultra Lite jig (use as router fence - it's great with a slight modification - see review on amazon). I've used this setup without any trouble at all at least twice a week. Please, please, please don't waste your money on Delta's worthless router/shaper."
2,Felt overcharged...,"My mistake was not reading the free sample before purchasing this book. I trusted the other review. However, I found this book to not be worth nearly 2.99, although that could be because I've been reading $.99 ebooks for the past week or so, and those have been better than this, which I paid three times as much for. I'm all for fun and silly books, but this one was so shallow it wasn't even worth the effort. His whole love thought process was ""hey, she's hot!"" and her's was ""hey, he kissed me! And I liked it!"" Nobody had any depth, or grew as a person. Which I admit, is probably a bit of a lofty goal for a romance novel, but I can dream, can't I? If you're looking for good cheap regency romance novels, I'd suggest trying Delle Jacobs, particularly The Mudlark or His Majesty, Prince of Toads. Don't waste your time on this one, as it moves too fast, gives the characters little background motivation for the things they do, and ends quite ridiculously."
2,Is all Manfredi this way?,"I had seen a lot of Manfredi's novels about and had attended a lecture of his when he was in Australia, so I was very interested to see what sort of a writer he was and how he would capture the period of the Ancient Greeks and Sparta.I must admit that I was dissappointed.While the storyline is ok (if not a little fantastic), it felt like I was reading a sort of laymans guide to Ancient Sparta. Integral cultural aspects of the Spartans were glossed over, while others were poorly explained and portrayed, ultimately (for someone who has read a lot on Ancient Sparta anyway) giving the novel a simplistic fantasy novel feel.Certainly not even close to being in the same league as Pressfield, Nicastro or Curtis Ford, I would have to say that if all Manfredi's Ancient Greek novels are like this, they are more for people with only a passing interest in the historical setting."
2,History for the not so historically inclined,"There is no doubt that this author knows his history, and given his credentials he should. I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Legion, although the following movie fell far short of the original book. Spartan, however, never really explained itself the way I hoped it would. By the end, I was still confused about the mysteries surrounding the long-lost brother and his adopted people. The story zigzagged back and forth so many times that I lost interest and had to force myself to finish."
3,Interesting twist to the tale of '300'...,"Although this book didn't focus DIRECTLY on the '300', thier story was a very important part to this story. I did enjoy this novel but the reason why I only gave it 3 stars was because it had to many down parts for me. Not enough to keep me from reading, but enough to bother me a little.The story was a good one and I enjoyed the battle, blood, and gore! Exactly what a story in this time frame ought to have."
2,Slow down a bit,"I'm halfway through the book now, and am seriously considering putting it down. See the other reader reviews for comments on the storyline. It is indeed a nice tale, set against a most powerful backdrop. However, it just feels like the author rushes through events at too fast a pace. Entire battles are described in a few paragraphs, what should be long prolongued drama filled scenes of major character death is boiled down to a few sentences. Really, the story told in this book is good enough to have been expanded into 6-8 books, but instead we are treated on a whirlwind tour spanning from the birth of the main character, to teenage years, to Thermopylae, to Platea and across the ocean - all in half the book so far. It's beginning to get tiresome."
3,nice novel about antiquity,"Nice novel about ancient Sparta, which has few smaller weak points. For instance the description of the pontoon bridge construction by Persian engineers is presented obscurely. The description of battles are not very dynamic in this book, what causes that this book, which has very interesting plot is not so good as it could be. This book is even historically accurate."
1,Really Disappointed,"I've owned this grinder for at least a few years. I can't remember when I got it, but I hardly use it. After between 1-1/2 to 2 hours of use, I went out to grind the head on a stake, and it would hardly spin up. When I went to grind, the act of grinding brought it to a halt. I thought Delta was supposed to be quality stuff, so I was quite surprised that this did this. because it is more than two years old, it is out of warranty, but I would expect to get more than two hours worth of use out of it. I won't get a delta for my next one."
4,Great value for the price,"Very professional product especially for the price. I used it strait away. Not the grinder's fault (at all) but make sure you mount it on a thick topped work bench or the vibrations will be irritating; otherwise, very well made and I'd buy again."
2,The usual made in China garbage,"It works OK, but it is really cheap. Looks like it was made in the USSR. The base is rusting out of the box - cheap metal. The welds and outside casing looking like a home built kit painted. Just cheap, cheap, cheap.Why can they offer something from somewhere else? Obviously, Delta/B&D; does not make this, they subcontract it and it shows. I would pay more, but the other offerings are the same thing in a different color. I would gladly pay $20 more, and not simply for yellow paint."
3,wonderful,"I loved this movie. I loved the charactor, the music, everything. But my favorite thing about the movie was that Rodney Eastman played in it. I love him he is cute and sexy and I wish i could marry him!! just go see the movie it's great"
5,"So cute, love it","I love everything about this product, came quick, looks amazing, super soft and it was the perfect shade I was looking for.I definitely recommend this bedding set"
2,I would not purchase this for someone else glad it was for my own baby,It arrived in a box however the plastic it was packed in once you opened the box was so dirty and black I just knew I would have to send it back however once I took it out the plastic it wasn't damaged or dirty at all just very wrinkle
2,"Not soft, made in China","Ordered the ecru set, thought it would feel like 100% cotton, but might as well have been polyester. The material in the bumper pad made a crinkling noise. Just wasn't a fan of the fabric quality - the sheets were rough too. The blanket was the best item in the set."
4,Good Buy,I've used this for two months now and I love it. Get's the job done and it's a bargain too.
1,POS,I have used one at school several times and it is great for theather were accuresy is not a concern be other wise it succs. its fence is not tall enough to stack two 2x4 on face and cut sfly. It is 13 amp not 15 amp. the mitewr scale is pathetic no verner agustment for fine tuning miters no preset stops.blade guard dose not side or move well at all.
3,good saw for light jobs.,"I bought this saw for light, occasional use about 20 months ago.As aspected, I used it little and it served me well. However at about 16 months the cast iron support that limits the saws depth of cut broke. I was surprised that it had failed with such light use.The nearest factory service was 70 miles away. It took it to them and left it for repair. I called three times to check on it and found the part was backordered at Delta with no ETA. Finally after 3 months it arrived and was repaired.The saw works well now but I have had some trouble with alignmentbut was able to easily correct it. I am sure at this price it is considered a throwaway saw by Delta but I do appreciate the two year warranty even if they are slow as hell supplying parts."
4,"Delta MS250 Shopmaster 10"" Compound Miter Saw","ASSEMBLY: Assembly was straightforwoard and took less than 30 minutes.SETUP: Blade alignment was acceptable out of the box. Miter stops were accurate but the bevel indicator was off and difficult to adjust.PROs and CONs: This saw has produced nice clean accurate cuts. However, the bevel indictor is difficult to read accurately."
2,"Had one, took it back","I had this, after looking at saws from harbor freight and sears and this. I got this. It is not bad, it does the job. I tried my brothers sears craftsman for a few extra dollars you can get the which feels more solid, more smooth, and more stable...So I returned it and got the craftsman. Also tried the 12"" dewalt sliding saw which is VERY NICE, but you can get 6 of these or the craftsman for the price of that."
5,A PERFECT HALLOWEEN STORY FOR CHILDREN,"""The Blue-Nosed Witch"" is a sweet little story that your young children will enjoy. Blanche and her little cat Brocket are just the cutest touch to this warm and fuzzy Halloween tale from the past. There is a mean old man in this story who Blanche and the trick or treaters she befriends teach a good lesson. But all in all, your little ones will want you to read this one about the little witch who was always late again and again."
4,It's good but Bland!,"Okay, so I have a cholesterol problem, what did I expect? I have used about 10 of these recipes, being forced to make lifestyle changes with my eating. I just find all the recipes a bit bland and leave you wanting for more. Not sure what the ""more"" is, but just more. I guess it's about learning new habits. This book did have good education about Cholestrol, carbs, good and bad fats in it. So for that alone, it's worth the price."
2,No pictures at all,"Bought this book because of my husband's recently discovered high chlolesterol. Have not tried any recipes from this book yet. So, maybe giving this book only 2 stars is unfair. BUT, even if these recipes could be so awsome if I tried, I still wanted to see some picutures, at least."
4,Easy simple recipes,"This book has a very good introduction on how to change the way you cook and eat. The recipes are simple and easy to prepare. Basically shows how to replace high calorie ingredients with low-fat, non-fat ingredients. Quite good overall."
5,Fundamentals of Love & Life,"This talk is simple, yet deeply wise. I have listened to many, many talks and teachings about the spiritual path and this is by far the most useful and the most healing. Not only are the precepts which he outlines, practical, effective and healing, but the sound of his voice is truly a healing presence in itself. I have my own copy, I gave my son a copy (he's 21) and I also gave a copy to my partner. I have explored various spiritual paths and would not consider myself a buddhist, but can't image these teachings being foreign to anyone who believes that god is a loving and truly compassionate being. I've rated this as five stars but the truth is it's off the star chart."
4,Food for thought,"I enjoyed this book but I should say it is not a continuous thread but a collection of writings bound by the common subject of love. That is the part I did not expect. Nevertheless, its content is like a delightful dessert full of reflection."
5,Absolutely Fiery!,"This is the perfect book for anyone who has owned, owns or wants to desperately have a Firebird!Very well written, with lots of knowledge!You can feel, that the Author has much love for cars- especially The Fabulous FirebirdsThank you Mr. Michael Lamm for this wonderful example of perfect detailing!!"
2,ok flick,This was one of lana clarkson's last movies before she was murdered by phil spector I believe. She deserved better than this very low budget flick which is ok at best. And it's not her fault it's just not the best done flick.
3,"Descent film, but no cigar","The beauty of the women in this movie is without doubt it's plus, it's makes you forget the averige acting. The storie is nice and has it's up's and down, it's not in every movie that you get to see a ""tittycam"". Enjoyable are the fighting scenes, there's one in where a girl beats-up two men, a catfight and more. For the price you won't be disappointed"
1,Not worth the time,"I was lookingforward to a typical ""beautiful lady cops who lose theirclothing a lot"" type of film. But somehow, that moviefailed to materialize. Schade."
4,Has an old feel.,"The old dialect is absolutely charming to listen to. Some songs were repetitive, and a couple pretty closely resembled one another, but I found it to my liking nonetheless."
5,A comprehensive manual for serious epee fencers and coaches,"Mr. Vass, formercoach for the Hungarian national epee squad, has written acomprehensive guide for the serious competitive epee fencer which should be in every fencer's and coach's library."
3,Diabetics Beware! This is one sugary series!,"Like all CLAMP animes, the animation is top-notch. However, the series falls flat story-wise and it's hard to get into the story-line. It is a refreshingly sweet series (downright adorable in some places) and worth seeing."
2,From Back Cover,"Will Travers left Hope Springs ten years ago, accused of a crime he didn't commit. He tried to make a life for himself and his young wife far, far away. But his wife wanted more, and left him for greener pastures. Now he's raising his son on his own, and he realizes there's no better place to do that than Hope Springs. Even if it means facing Libby Jefferies again. Especially if it means facing Libby Jefferies. She was the only ""witness"" to his alleged crime.But Libby is not at all pleased to see him. Particularly when a series of ""accidents"" begins to occur. But this time Will needs her on his side. She's the only person who can help him make enough sense of the past to allow him to give his son a future. And, ironically, that future now includes Libby.2nd in the Hope Springs series"
4,"Shopmaster 360 6"" Planer/jointer",I have not used product yet but the features are easy to understand and very accessible.
1,Check carefully on receipt,"I bought one of these a few years ago as my first jointer. I thought I was really a klutz because I could never get it adjusted right. Being a beginner, I just blamed myself and kept saying I need to take a course. Finally, long after it was out of warranty, I took it to a pro to adjust for me. I was told the beds being out of parallel was a manufacturing defect and it couldn't be adjusted enough to get it true.I know most instance of this product will be fine, and I read similar reviews of other jointers--at least in this price range. But be sure to check out the things the manual says are factory set and don't need adjustment. What that means is if it isn't right, it can't be adjusted out."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Delta jointer works well for home hobbist.It took about 3 hours to assemble.The dust chute was dented due to rough shipment and had to be undented.The attachment tab on the dust chute had to be rivetted back on due to a weak rivet and came off when undenting and reshaping dust chute.Except for the rough shipping, it works as expected for hobbist. It's much better than any bench model would be."
2,Rick Hogue,"I purchased this jointer about 6 weeks ago and I'm returning it to Lowe's tomorrow. First, this thing vibrates so bad when running there's no way it could make a smooth cut. I adjusted the belt several times, no help. Second, it wouldn't cut a straight line for anything. I checked all the settings, everything is right on, blades are the right height, tables are parallel, everything is as it should be. It just won't make a straight edge and the more you run the piece through the more concave it gets. I even ran a perfectly straight piece through it and it did the same to it. The tables are out of flatness a little but not enough to cause this I wouldn't think. At least I don't have to dissassemble it before I return it. Think I'll give Jet a try."
1,Cheap - that's what IT IS,"Problems started right from the beginning during the assembly.The stand is not square so when attaching the main unit to the base using 3 provided screws I was able to put only 2. For the third one the holes don't align. There's no way to square this thing. After ""assembling"" I tried to align the outfeed table to the blades. Surprise! I can turn the adjusting wheel back and forth but table doesn't move. It is about 1/8"" higher than the blades. I don't know what other surprises awaiting me when I will wrestle with the fence - but not tonight. I'm too tired and frustrated. I hope Delta have some kind of service. I bought this jointer today brand new at Lowe's and it is on warranty."
1,Not like the picture!,"I was very disappointed when I received these earrings. I purchased them as a gift, but I'm not sure if I'll still give them away. They're called ""Pink Shell"" earrings, but the shell looks pretty white to me...more like mother-of-pearl without a hint of pink. If you're looking for pink, these won't be the earrings for you."
1,VERY Disappointing,"This is a real bad purchase. I bought this item to go with my new pink dress. The earrings look pink in the picture, but are actually absolutely white. I will return them back and look for a better deal elsewhere."
2,Oster electric frying pan,"I purchased this pan last year. I used it for the 4th time last week and the lid fell apart! I did not have any problems with the numbers on the dial. they never did rub off. the glass lid was ok but the whole unit got hot, which was expected.What i did not expect was for the knob on the lid to come apart into about 6 or 7 pieces while I was frying chicken. It was a mess. I went to lift up the lid by the knob and all the pieces fell into the hot chicken and on the counter which made grease splash. Luckily I was not burned because I was able to jump back quick enough to avoid the splater. Now the glass lid just has a hole in the center where the knob used to be along with the adjustable window, spring, washers and screws. all of that stuff fell off. Now what do i do with it now??"
1,AVOID and Run Away from this product,"I bought the oster fry pan in sept. 10. It is now Dec. 2010. I have used this fry pan perhaps 6 times since purchase. Even tho I only used a teflon spatula, last time I used it I noticed that small flecks of the fry pan teflon surface had lifted. I only fry ground turkey meat for making dog food in the pan. I went to use the fry pan tonight, and now it does not work even though the control shows that it is getting power. My Sunbeam fry pan lasted 32 years. I am going to buy the Cuisinart fry pan at William Sonoma when it goes on sale again. Do not waste your money on this Oster product."
3,Skillet works great--can't see the temp!,"I purchased this skillet in November 2007. After using it just a couple of times, the numbers wore off the controller! I'm still using it, but very disappointed about the numbers, as I now need to guess at the temperature. Overall, the skillet does its job well. I love the glass lid and the vented lid."
5,Oster Electric Skillet,I love it. It does a great job on roasts. Like the vent in the lid that can be adjusted open or closed.
2,"Ok to cook with, but numbers rub off the dial!","I like the frypan to cook with, like the glass top, the square design. It's easy to clean, and the tilt feature is nice. The quick release of the controller, while a good idea, is very flimsy and should be made of a stiffer material. We've returned it once because the numbers rubbed off the controller. Our store replaced it with a new one and we very carefully avoided the numbers on the dial until stirfrying some chicken. As soon as oil splattered on the dial numbers, they wiped right off with a paper towel. What good is an electric frypan when you don't know how hot it is? We're going to return it and replace it with something else."
1,this product has issues,"I loved it the minute I got it, but it has one fatal flaw. The numbers on the tempature dial all rubbed off. I called customer service and this is a common problem. In about 4 to 6 weeks I will get a new dial... what a hassle. I say get a different product and save yourself 4 to 6 weeks. Other than that I love it. :)"
3,What's My Temperature?,"I like the styling (glass top is great to check up on food) and the size. Unfortunately, the heating element dial is difficult to turn and the numbers became all smudged making it impossible to tell the temperature setting. Unless they've fundamentally redesigned the element numbering, I don't see any sense in getting a replacement element."
3,I hate the lid!,"My ancient Sunbeam with the lightweight aluminum lid finally died. How I miss it! This one cooks just fine - so did the old one - but the lid is almost impossibly heavy for a senior with arthritis, and the handle gets too hot to lift without a potholder (unlike the old one.)"
2,Buy Potholders!,"First, the pros: it heats up and cooks as well as any other electric skillet.Now for the cons: unlike other designs, this unit is vented through the lid/handle. Completely nonsensical! If you're cooking anything that produces steam and plan on using the lid, you would be STRONGLY advised to purchase some good pot holders. I got used to using my 16"" Presto which has a steam escape down on the lid so grabbing the handle is never a problem. The other con from my perspective is the cord attachment. It requires some real diligence getting it plugged into the pan since it's a very tight and precise fit. Also, the numbers wore off within the first month, so I use a cord from a different unit. Lastly, within a month of light/moderate use, the teflon(?) coating is scratched and peeling. These things are NOT what they used to be!Would I recommend this Oster to anyone? No way."
2,Didn't Improve On Its Second Viewing,"Talky, boring western with little gunplay and too much chasing back and forth. Rock Hudson is stiff and Phil Carey smiles too much. Both Neville Brand and Lee Marvin are wasted in small roles as bad guys. Only perennial bad guy, Leo Gordon, (here in an atypical semi-good guy role) stands out in performance and characterization."
5,Great,I had to buy this for my English class. It's a nice book which has lots of sections and different variations and whatnot to keep the reader's attention. The book was delivered to me quickly and in perfect condition. Great price too!
4,Very helpful,This book has been helpful to understand academic writing. There are helpful visuals of the different writing styles.
2,good book BAD service,"The book is very good for explaining writing concepts in an easily understood format. It also color codes rhetorical aspects of writing, which never helped me, but I'm sure would be quite useful for other people. However, the shipping time for this book was completely unacceptable. I bought this book 2 weeks before college started along with several other books from amazon. All the other books arrived just on time, but this book was almost 3 weeks late so I finally was forced to buy a different copy from the college store since I needed the book for a class. So now I have an extra copy of the book. Wasn't very happy about this."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A group of humans is left stranded on an alien world. The native inhabitants are not that dissimilar, but genetically different enough that you can't breed hybrids.Such a small population is suffering a slow decline, and each race minds their own business. A Romeo and Juliet situation and a serious threat causes some upheaval."
4,scots in georgia and the deep south,"The book was bought for genealogical info. Not only did I find the references pertaining to my family, but my wife found valuable info on her ancestors as well."
3,Given as a gift?,"I think I must have ordered this and given it as a gift. I didn't read it myself, so I can't give a fair review, sorry!"
4,Out of the Ordinary,"Every summer there is a opera presented in an open air quarry in St. Margarethen, Austria. In 2004 the opera was Aida. There was a huge set and cast including horses and 3 elephants. I thought the singing and conducting was excellent. I was disappointed that the orchestra was pint sized and the trumpets really let us down in the triumphal scene. Also, the ballet, where girls in swimsuits sacrifice a cute blond boy in a bikini, is best forgotten. But a very stirring third and fourth act left me with quite a positive impression. Excellent audio and video, also."
4,Love It!,"I love these knives. And, I was happy to find the knife to complete my set. Great ease of use and very sharp."
3,"7"" knife will break. HANDLE WITH CARE!","I have had this set for one year now. They are great for cutting a variety of things and are well balanced. The only flaw is that they are thin and light. The 7"" broke while sharping on a sharping steel. The knife will need sharping over time with daily use. I use mine everyday in my home. This knife is not intended for rough handling."
3,Disappointing,"While I love it just for the fact all these action scenes are absolutely amazing, I find it to be still Woo's laziest effort. Usually he has a story and usually he has character, but not here. There was nothing to keep interest when nothing was blowing up. It was only when the mayhem occured that the film actually moves along. I am not a big fan of the movie, but I recommend it just for the last 30-45 minutes of the film, which is nothing but a big shoot-out. I'm surprised Woo was able to carry it out that long, and not get (too) repetitive. If you love the film, get the Criterion disc. The extras are well worth it!!!"
5,I CANT GET ENOUGH,"I first saw this movie about three years ago and have been dying to get a hold of it on DVD. This X-mas I am taking full advantage and purchasing a good set of speakers and mini blinds to lock myself in my room to enjoy this to the limit. I love all kinds of action from arnold to anime, but nothing compares to Hard-Boiled. It was everything and then some of what I could ever ask for in an action film. All of Johns newer more ""americanized"" stuff is just a walk in the park compared to this action experiance. Woo is tha man! Hong Kong Rocks!"
5,"""Hard Boiled"" Action","If you have seen ""The Killer"", this is probably another John Woo/Chow Yun-Fat movie you would want to check out. Tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) plays a sax playing hard boiled cop who battles it out with the HK triads. The shoot out with Tequila and HK mobsters at the tea house is extraordinarily violent, yet poetic in execution, which is what I love about Woo films. Tequila teams up with Alan (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), an undercover cop posing as a gangster, and they both almost single handedly duke it out, guns blazing and all, with the triads. The final gun battle, with many casualties, in the hospital was just mind blowingly violent that it leaves you stunned with eyes glued to the screen. In many ways this movie is more violent than ""The Killer"", though lacking it's emotional charge and poetic symbolism. This film is one of the highlights of John Woo's career as a director and Chow Yun-Fat as a heroic bloodshed cult hero."
1,Violence doesn't make a movie exciting,"I bought the film 'cos I wanted to see a realistic movie. This is not what I imagined.This is just violent, that's it. This is like the famous doom game. Very unrealistic.That lot's of violence doesn't make it better. This movie makes you brutal too. If youhave made the mistake to order it then buy a romantic movie or a comedy to keep the balance.(Example the Crazy/Beatiful a nice one.)And this was not that exciting action movie. Sometimes it was boring what changed to blood, and so on. The english dubbed is simple horrible.If you wanna buy an action movie where you are made to stick in front of the screenthen buy a Schwarzennegger movie. If you like martial arts, buy the RoyalWarriors with Michelle Yeoh. It's one of my favorite and it is better in every aspect than this one of a thousand one movie.Anyway, next time I'll buy a Robert Williams movie.At least it is entertaining, makes me excited and makes me think of life."
3,Important film that didn't age well...,"When Hard Boiled came out as a theatrical release I was blown away. It was utterly unlike any other film I had seen up to that point. Now though it's been imitated so many times, both by Hollywood and by Woo himself, it just doesn't hold up. It plays almost as a parody of itself.It's worth seeing because it is such an important milestone, but don't be surprised if your memory of the film is stronger than the film itself."
4,Can you say John Wayne guns with endless bullets?,"We were ready for this movie to be over when it finally ended. Overacting and pistols that shot more bullets than they could ever possibly hold made it corny in places so it lost some character. I'm ok with the purchase since it was only $14 and will watch it maybe once a year, but I will wait until I'm in the mood for it. Chow Yun Fat saved it, imo, and is why I still gave it 4 stars."
4,"Complex, brilliant film with astonishing action set-pieces","HARD-BOILED[La Shou Shen Tan](Hong Kong - 1992)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: MonoJohn Woo's electrifying crime-thriller amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its action set-pieces. As with virtually all of his post-1986 HK films, Woo generates a tangible sense of melancholy by placing honorable, chivalrous - even lovable - characters into situations where all those precious moral virtues are constantly being challenged and devalued by the greed and cynicism of our modern age. And yet, Woo was eventually persuaded to conclude his picture on an optimistic note, with the villains routed and the good guys allowed to resume their places in the grand scheme of things. It's a daring move, given everything which precedes it, but no less effective than the all-out tragedy which Woo had originally envisaged."
1,As Bad as You Might Expect,"Don't go out and buy this until you watch it on Amazon or through Netflix.If you've never seen this movie before, watch it and enjoy.But if have seen a fine quality version, you are bound to be disappointed with this one.It's about as bad as you might expect, given the history of shoddy blu-ray work Dragon Dynasty is becoming famous for. Aspect ratio, sound quality, picture distortions--all are par for the course with Dragon Dynasty.Sad part is, this company seems to have a monopoly on blu-ray conversion rights for Hong Kong classics.Very sad indeed."
5,Sets the standard for action movies for years to come,"""Hard Boiled"" is singlehandedly the most spectacular action film I have seen. The shootouts in this movie are as thrilling and as intense as any I have seen. Director John Woo is extrodinary at directing action scenes, and after this film you will see why. This movie makes most american action movies look anemic. Don't miss this film it will blow you away."
1,Very mad,I wish i could give a review but my package was stolen before i ever got the chance to watch it.but i remember watching it 20 years ago.it was a great movie.I'm very disappointed
5,MOST VIOLENT MOVIE.......SURE IS,"ENTERTAINIG. If you like movies with guns and violence, guns and violence and more guns and violence and even more bloody Violence. Then 2 Simple Words for this film. RENT IT or BUY IT and most of all WATCH IT.Brilliant. John Woo is magnificent"
4,Hard Boiled,I was not sure what this movie would be about but I like the actor Chow Yun-Fat so I thought what the heck. It turned out to be a really good action movie. It keeps you going from beginning to end.
2,If you can get past the smell,"...these cookies are okay. I've had the caramel apple and double chocolate chunk and loved them (still do). The peanut butter flavor, however, has been a disappointment. They smell a little bit like wet cardboard. Fortunately, though, they taste somewhat better than they smell, but it's clear that this is a healthfood cookie. I may try toasting one to see if that makes it easier to palate...however, when I'm on the go and want to pull one out of my bag or back pocket to snack on, I won't have the benefit of the toaster."
3,could be better,heavy-not light-cannot taste the peanut butter- good size-were fresh and soft-i would not consider them gourmet - prettyexpensive-not unique
4,Ok substitute when Amazon runs out of your favorite flavor!,"These are good and filling! I like that they're vegan! Great peanut taste, but not as good as the peanut butter chocolate chip that they were out of when I ordered these! They're a filling breakfast for on the run days! The big thing about these breakfast cookies is that they need to be refrigerated. We didn't do that once and several cookies grew mold in just a couple days of room temperature. This is also a problem because ups sometimes leaves them on our front steps rather than our porch and they have gone unnoticed for a couple days a few times that we've ordered them. Erin Baker's customer service is really friendly and helpful, and the cookies actually taste better cold than room temperature!!"
5,A Classic Album,"I'm both proud but surprised to be the first to be reviewing a truly great albumI first heard this by chance in a soul music shop and had to ask who it was. It was someone I'd never heard ofThese are apparently demos for other artists - several are for female singers and so we have the unusual sound of a guy singing a girls' song - but it works tremendously wellSo often you read about undiscovered masterpieces and generally speaking they turn out to be a disappointment. This is a notable exception. It's hard to place this in terms of genre because he is very much his own man, so I would say it is very much an album literally full of music (count the tracks) which all sound like classic soul cutsI have to say, however, that the title track is the only cut I don't like and seems to these ears at least out of keeping with the rest of the songsListen to the samples - I can't believe that this music is so obscure. The album is a classic"
4,Very easy to setup and get started.,"I was hesitant to buy this item after reading one of the other reviews regarding how difficult the setup was due to bolts and fasteners being tapped poorly or wrong. I have to say the setup took me 5 minutes. There were 6 small bolts, and 4 threaded knobs. Everything went together just fine, and the whole thing took about 5 minutes. I purchased this model over others because of the variable speed option and the sharpening wheel. I had a tough time justifying the added expense for the variable speed, but feel it will be worth it in the long run. A $30 premium for that feature seems a bit steep. I plan to use it to sharpen my mower blades, chisels, and general shop cleaning, polishing, and sharpening. It should be fine for the moderate use I plan. I would have gone for the DeWalt if I felt I would be using it for heavy duty or commercial type use. Nice overall, but the price premium is what takes away the 5th star."
2,Grinder variable speed lasted 10 days.,I just bought a new lathe and needed a grinder to sharpen the wood turning tools. I picked this grinder for cost and features. I liked the variable speed. The light on the grinder is a big plus. The grinder came undamaged and the joy to use until about the third time I turned it on. The variable speed control stopped working. The grinder was stuck at its top speed. I returned it and got my money back. I have a few Delta tools in my shop and haven't had too many issues with them.
5,Lovely earrings,"I didn't find these earrings to be larger than expected, nor did I (or any of the people I came across while wearing them today) find them to look fake. The stones are sky blue and perfectly clear. The settings are durable, well made and fit exactly as stated, with the stones hanging just under the earlobe. Several people commented on them, as well as asked the coveted ""where-did-you-get-those"" question. I'm very pleased with this purchase!"
3,Bigger and Heavier than Expected,I've a small face and find the earrings too big for me. The quality is OK though.
3,Bigger than expected,"These earrings are definitely pretty, but I agree with the other reviewers who said they were bigger than they expected. I bought them as a gift for my mother but ended up returning them, because they didn't look good on me so I knew they probably wouldn't look good on her. That's not to say they're not nice, I just expected something a little daintier."
2,Not very useful for the at-home workout,"I was disappointed with this tape. More than half of the exercises require a bench, which was not specified in the tape description when I purchased it. I did the whole workout, simply lying on the floor whenever Cory used the bench, but I did not feel that I got very much out of it. The triceps workouts were good (and do not require a bench), but if that is all you're looking for, I recommend trying something else. Also, the tape claims to be from 1995, but it looks more like it was produced in 1985. This tape is for people with a home gym or for those who go to a gym to workout."
2,Cory has better videos than this one ...,"I bought this video but ended up returning it. It's not for a home workout but more a gym tutorial. Plus it is not done in Cory's normal style. Sorry Cory... If you are looking for some really good tapes by Cory, I highly recommend these three: Cory Everson Get Hard - Arms and Shoulders; Cory Everson Get Hard - Abdominals and Glutes; Cory Everson's Total Workout. I use these three tapes weekly and am sore after each workout."
2,Poorest Delta product I ever purchased,"I purchased this press to upgrade to a 12"" press. The reviews on the 12"" varable speed press were good and I have been very satisfied with the other Delta products I have purchased over the years. I liked the thought of a varable speed press so I bought it and have been very disappointed.1. The machine requires frequent oiling. To do that, the top cover must be removed (small screws and washers). Why Delta did not install a piano hinge is beyond me. I did. An easy fix.2. There are no intermediate speed ratings on the face of the machine. I called Delta and the tech rep told me ""that's not required for hobbiest"". I then asked, ""Why then did the press ship with a paper diagram indicating recommended speeds for different types and sizes of drills?Bottom Line: If you are looking for a 12"" press don't buy this one."
4,Variable speed worth the price of admission,"Nice machine. To change speeds on all other presses you have to move belts. The variable speed dial on the front is slick, but don't force it. You are essentially changing the width of a pulley with the dial, so the belt has to move in or out in the groove. They reccommend oiling weekly, but the top is held on with six screws, which is way too much work to accomplish the task. installing a piano hinge on one side with a magnet catch would facilitate easier access to the pulleys."
1,Phewy,"I got the drill press last year as a gift. I had only used it 4 times. As I can see that most people with this drill press are not very impressed with the variable speed adjustment. It has to be the worst design I have ever seen in a tool. To add insult to injury when I went to use it the 5th time to motor blew, while it is still under warranty I am getting new motor, but I still have to ask myself, ""what's the point"" the truth is the tool sucks. The truth is that delta knows they have a bad designReview number 9 by: Dana H. P'Simer Sr. says "" delta has a revised design"" if so why then all the reviews dated after that have had all the same trouble with the variable speed design.Tisk Tisk Tisk Delta.I gave it a 1 star. Not because the tool was badly design (which it is) but I gave it a zero because delta knows it is badly designed. Is not stocking the parts to fix it properly and is still selling a dog that Delta knows is a dogEd A."
2,Another pulley victim!,"Wish I would have read these reviews two years ago. Yep, mine fell apart yesterday (in the middle of a project for a customer). Just like everyone else, the rear variable speed pulley came apart. The spring popped off of the shaft (among other things). Guess this gives me a reason to buy a new (and better) machine. ""Gosh darn, Honey, I have to get a new drill press...shucks"".I gave this tool 2 stars...one star for lasting 2 years and one star for giving me a reason to buy a new power tool!"
2,Short life span,"After drilling about 300 holes in wood, the drill press started making a grinding noise and vibrating excessively. When I took it to the repair shop the technician told me it was probably the bearings. He commented that Delta uses cheap bearings made in China and they fail at a high rate. That was about a month ago. The repair shop had to send the press back to Delta and I haven't heard a word from anyone since.While the press was working I was happy with it, except I would like a little more power for using hole saws on hardwood."
2,Delta DP350 Shopmaster Drill press,"New Review as of 05/02/2011After having this drill press for now over 3 years i still like the drill press, but i have had pulley problems also i have modified and corrected the problem through trial and error but it now is working good again you can purchase new belts through an auto parts store just take off and measure or take and compare until you find the one that works, delta doesn't have any on hand per my experience with them. I feel the quality of Delta products is now much to be desired, they need to sink the boats from China and start making good American products again and MADE in USA, but go look at Craftsman products they are the same china junk, i don't buy craftsman anymore even hand tools, instead i go to Auctions and garage sales and purchase old USA made tools and am getting rid of all non USA made tools in my shop, at garage sale prices."
1,Poorly designed Inferior junk,"Buy anything else!Delta obviously doesn't test their tools. Mine broke after less than two hours of run time.Top of motor pulley slips off bushing, resulting wobble breaks snap ring. You'll spend many hours cussing it.Replacing the snap ring won't fix it. I ran a screw through pulley into bushing. This fix is chronicled with photos by another Amazon shopper. Will probably end up replacing #@!!% snap ring with cotter pin.Just figuring out how to depress the spring to install a new snap ring took me a couple of hours. Finally assembled lever system using some bar clamps and carefully sized hole in wood."
1,POS,This thing worked well until I bumbed the variable speed knob while swinging a board around. We had it jammed in one speed and used it for a time. It is seldom used. Today it will not turn on. We think the switch is broken. I peeked into the top today and it looks like the top motor spindle has seperated from its bushing and is just bouncing around on the motor axel. Not a serviceable machine. Pos.
1,Stay away from this one,"I've had mine for 3 yrs without problems although the variable speed mechanism made mysterious noises and everything else squeeks. All the adjustments are very fussy and could have been done much better. Still, all was not bad until the rear pulley blew ... as I see others wrote about. There's a very hefty spring on the rear pulley spindle that is held in check with only a small retention ring that snaps on to the spindle. This is what gave way and allowed the spring to take flight with the pulley on it's heels. The manual was useless & I had to puzzle out how to fix it. Fixed it once and it broke again!Fixed it again and so far so good BUT I am running it only at the highest speed which is the position that results in minimum tension on the spring. If this doesn't work ... I'm done with Delta Variable Speed models!!!"
4,DP350,I e-mailed Delta about the reviews shown here and asked about the problems with the speed adjusting spindle and pulley. A rep called me the next day and reassured me that my unit based on the ser# has the revised design. I must say that the product so far has been flawless. I dinged it one star for the 6 screws on the spindle cover and the inacessibility of the angle scale.It is a great bargain tho'!
3,A good press but needs rework,"Good:Variable speed - middle ranges are not marked but easy to figure outSolid tableSolid three handle drill extensionTable crank works wellFairly quietBad:Cheap chuck - upgrade to a JacobsTop motor pulley became seperated from collet - easy fix, drill hole through both when lined up, tap and then Loctite a screw to hold. Newer units have pins to prevent this, mine is 3 years old. Fix took 20 minutes.Cover has too many screws - easy fix, remove screws and install a couple small hinges. Replace one screw on opposite with thumbscrew. Fix took 20 minutes.Additional comment:You do not need to lubricate this press or run through the speed range daily. Once a week would be fine. I service mine once a month."
1,Pile of JUNK,I bought this drill press on Delta's so called Quality Products.I assembled the unit and 3 holes later the thing started making a loud grinding noise. After I took of the cover a large spring shot across the room. This large massive spring witch pushes on the torque converter pully was held in by the smallest circlip I have ever seen. If I had only had to fix this thing once I would have been happy. Now I have a jig built in order so I can put the circlip back on. If I had a penny for every time this thing has craped out on me I would have bought a new one. The engineer who specified that paperclip circlip should be droped in the East River whith this drill press tied to his leg.
1,Not very impressive,"I have had this drill press for almost 4 years for mostly light duty shop work. As my woodworking time is limited, it has not been used extensively. Despite this it has failed twice; first the on off switch broke down. It was fixable, but a bit annoying. Now the pin holding the spindle pulley broke, rendering the machine useless. It was not possible to get a part of the pin out, and I have temporarily fixed it with a piece of a coat hanger. It was disappointing to note that the accompanying parts diagram was rendering an incorrect picture of the machine, and it makes me question how much quality control this machine has been subject to.When the coat hanger breaks I will invest in a Powermatic variable speed drill press, which might have been the right thing to do from the get go."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I should not have ignored all the poor reviews I found on several sites about the variable speed control on this drill press. I figured they had tried to adjust it when it wasn't running. I took delivery on this drill press yesterday. The very first time I turned it on and, SLOWLY AND GENTLY, tried to adjust the spindle speed. IT BROKE! When I opened it up, the belt had jumped the pulleys; it appeared as though the adjustable speed mechanism tore itself apart. I'll check into getting it fixed, but not sure I even want to keep it. That may depend on what the service people tell me about this piece of junk. At this point, though, it's a very heavy paper weight and definitely not worth wasting your time or money. This experience has SERIOUSLY damaged my opinion of the Delta brand."
1,Don't even think about buying this !,"After less than 20 hours of shop time, my pulley and belt drive blew. Had it fixed by Delta authorized center; blew the minute I turned it on. Had it fixed AGAIN by a different Delta center and FOR THE MOMENT it's working. But if it breaks again, the center said that the Delta factory doesn't have the pulleys or belts for repair and doesn't know if they'll ever have any more ! ! ! Way to go Delta! You've duped me for the last time. What's with companies that market products and stop providing repair parts in just one year? There should be a federal law."
4,/,should have only about 50 pages instead of 176...too redundant without clarification which is the reason for repetition and it missed....
5,Unknown Genius,"An old boyfriend gave me this CD back in college; about 12 years ago. Though I lost the CD ages ago, the music always haunted and stayed with me. So the other day I finally decided to order the CD again. I was pleased to find it just as complex, unique and innovative as I had remembered. I wonder who these guys were and where they are now?"
5,The World is Your Family,"This is the wonderful story of a group of girls living in an orphanage in France. It is a tale of love and friendship and adventure. It comes away with the message that your family is whoever happens to love and care for you. With beautiful illustrations by Garth Williams. This was one of my favorite books as a child, and I finally got one located through amazon.com-every time I see it on the shelf, I get a little whif of childhood, and it's a perfume for all ages."
1,Needs a Warning Label,"This book should carry a warning label that lets you know it's a 230-page infomercial for the Kabbalah Center. It contains little that hasn't been regurgitated from ""Rabbi"" Berg's work, and what little doesn't come from him comes from fundamentalist Christians like Bob Larsen. The author's credibility is also damaged in its own right by lapses such as placing Pirke Avot in the Talmud, when in fact there's no Gemara for Pirke Avot, so it's only found in the Mishna. I was bitterly disappointed with the book."
3,Puzzled,"The editorial review says ""Measurement functions include length, area, volume, double segment length, and continuous measurement.""I've been successful at measuring length. If it does all the other things mentioned there is no information in the literature enclosed that say how that can be accomplished. The unit has three buttons ft/metric, on/off, read."
5,Good Tire Gauge,"This is a solidly built tire gauge. It has a bleed valve that allows you to let air out while measuring your tire pressure. This let's you to get your tire pressure exactly right quickly. I carry one of these gauges in each of our two cars, and have found them very useful.I would recommend this tire gauge based on quality build and ease of use."
1,Terrible product,"Sticks on the tire valve. The pressure needle drops off half the time, so you do not know the tire pressure, then other times it works and keeps the reading until you use the release button. This is the cheapest junk I have ever bought"
4,Verify The Accuracy; Update and Spelling Correction,"I have now purchased five of these guages from Amazon over the last two years or so for myself and family. I like the ease of use with the flexible hose and the angled connection for tightly spaced spokes on garden carts. However, one of these five gauges reads low by four pounds. The other four read exactly the same and are within six-tenths of a pound of the reading from a digital guage. I also have two other dial type guages that read low by two pounds and three pounds. My conclusion is that tire guages tend to be inaccurate, and that this brand is probably as accurate or better than most, but not perfect. One needs to compare readings with other gauges and gain confidence on which way, if any, the readings from a particular gauge need to be adjusted. That said, these gauges are the easiest to use and read that I have ever owned."
2,Not made very well. A big disappointment.,I purchased this after my nephew ran over my old one. This one does not seem made very well. The dial on the inside is crooked and the button to release the air is in an awkward place. It was a disappointment.
2,"nice gauge, but not very accurate","The tire gauge is nice and seems constructed well; flexible hosing, easy pressure release button. But it seemed to read low and after testing with three other types of tire gauges (electronic, standard piston-type, professional bicycle pump) which all read between 35-37 psi, this one read 28psi, even after checking a number of times to ensure I had a good seal. Have not yet contacted manufacturer since even under warranty, shipping and return shipping would cost $6 for a $10 item."
1,"Inaccurate, unreliable","I bought one of these several years ago, expecting reliability and accuracy. I got neither. The first one failed after 2-3 years, it was replaced by the company, although I paid shipping. The second unit failed after 2 years, giving erratic readings, with a dial indicator that won't zero. Totally untrustworthy."
4,Nice Tire Gage,"This is a very nice tire gage which appears to be well-built and also well-designed. It is easy to read with large numerals and markings. The construction is mostly brass and the bleed and hold button functions very well. The flexible hose is a plus and the nozzle seals without air loss on the tires of both of my cars, one of which has valve extenders. As best I can tell, the accuracy of the gage is quite good, within one or two pounds at most.I gave this product four stars instead of five only because it was ""made in China"". When I e-mailed the company about this, I was advised retailers are reluctant to give shelf space to American made products if they can't meet the Chinese price point, even if the American made products are better quality. Consumers also seem to put price above quality. Something to think about the next time you are shopping at a ""big box"" store. You may also want to read Hedrick Smith's book, ""Who Stole the American Dream"", which is also for sale on Amazon."
1,Pan-G face lift costs more time & money than a regular facelift & does not last as long,"This book is NOT about you exercising your own facial muscles. You need to get hooked up to a special machine located in Canada or Chicago, IL. It actually costs more than a face lift and needs repeating to keep up the slight results. Seems like a waste of time & money (to me). Just by writing & selling this book, the author has probably gotten her Pan-G lifts done free of cost for advertising and wears so much makeup it is difficult to tell if the procedure really works. I was very disappointed with this book & honestly cannot recommend it."
1,the pan-g non-surgical face lift,"I personally agree with the other two reviews. What a rip off!!! Can not get the treatment advertisized anywhere in the Missouri area even if I wanted to. Would not recommend this if you think it is exercises for your face. It is ok if you are looking for spa type procedures, skin care products & pricing information."
3,I was disappointed,Not want i expected at all. An informational to spend $4000.00 on your face instead of plastic surgery. ??????? And I was stupid enough to pay for this. Live and learn.
1,Totally Worthless,"This Book is as worthless as a toilet paper roll. I threw it away. I felt too ripped off to even bother Amazon with a refund. At least, I can save someone else from wasting their money."
4,Good Protection,It's good to keep you dry and good for overnight or long waits between changes. The tapes does need to handle carefully in order to prevent from tearing off.
1,For Chicago Fans Only!,"Chicago Live'69 may not be live, it sounds like studio demos.25 Or 6 To 4 is the best track, then I'm A Man starts the decline into over improvisation which concludes with a 16 minute Liberation.The band have made some fantastic jazz rock and ballards, but not on this CD."
1,Who has the time?,"I bought this book based on the 10 positive reviews it received. Unfortunately, my money would have been best spent on a Tony Buzan book. MAPPING INNER SPACE has serious downfalls. Mainly, all the mindmaps in the book are rich in color with excellent drawn pictures...how could I even attempt to duplicate this? Though the author states several times that drawing perfectly isn't required, her own examples demonstrate that her drawing skills are very superior. Also, the use of different colors made her mind maps frameable...how would have time during a meeting to draw such elaborate pictures? I would highly recommend that you buy one of Tony Buzan's earlier books on this subject...you won't feel so intimidated when you read them."
2,Soporific,"Expected more from Cincinnati/Telarc (see Kunzel, Erich cond. Hard to believe mostly the same musicians played so well for his baton.) Lightweight Gallic performance, recorded at low levels with little bass, dynamics seldom exceed much of anything (far under reference level technically), little hall reverb, all in all like sleepwalking through while mechanically doing each note on pitch and in largo tempo cutting off transients. This misfire has no resemblance to most other recordings of the work; it will not interrupt anyone's sleep or interfere with their concentration elsewhere for the most part."
2,Pathetic .... Absolutely Pathetic,"What a major disappointment, not only in Telarc but in the orchestra that apparently slept through most of its playing. There are many, many other recordings of Symphonie Fantastique, any one of which is certain to beat this one. Don't take my word for it, though....find out the hard way like I did."
1,Incorrect Description of the ElectraTrac Extension Cord,"The ElectraTrac extension cord is advertised as ""6 outlets spaced 8 feet apart"" on both the website and the box. However, it is actually 5 outlets spaced almost 10 feet apart, with a 6th outlet on the very end, only one foot away from the 5th outlet."
5,Power along the line....,I bought this cord for my small shop. Shipping was prompt in 4 days with the super saver shipping. The cord itself is made of a bright yellow heavy gauge (Thick!). The Green lights illuminate on all the outlet heads when plugged in and make it easy to find them in the dark or when its coiled. It also has two holes on each side of the outlets so one can mount the cord staionary on the wall or ground.I have not used more than three tools at once but when I did I had no problems. This is a high quality tool that gives one the freedom to make and plug in six extra outlets in seconds. I would recommend this tool to anyone...its a gem in my shop.
4,comin' from a good place,"Szasz does not disappoint. I did not give this book 5 stars because Szasz merely reiterates what he says in all of his books. Nonetheless, as always, Szasz geniuinely expresses his concerns about psychiatry and reveals his great compassion as a psychiatrist."
3,You win some...You lose some,"I loved this doll, I bought this for my daughter for christmas who was a little over 4 months. I knew she wouldn't play with it for a while. She is now 8 months and still hasn't touched it. It doesn't make noise or anything so it doesn't catch her attention. The quality is wonderful- very soft. I hope that she will play with this later on.update: she just turned 10 months and has played with the doll a little bit- she likes to point out the nose.... *maybe there is hope* :) I purchased the baby stella doll for her bday so lets hope that dolls are in by then lol"
4,Cute doll,"We call this doll ""pod baby"" which makes us giggle. Our poor little pod baby has had several trips through the washing machine and dryer thanks to our little girl. But she's durable and still super cute, although a tad faded now. Very cute little soft doll that I am happy to have bought. I later ordered the peanut baby too!"
5,"sweet, sweet pea..",My daughter LOVES sweet pea. She sleeps with her every night(out of the pea pod). It is the perfect size and is super soft. I am very pleased with this purchase. Sweet pea was one of her first words-so cute!!!
4,Adorable and Soft,"This toy is adorable and perfect for an infant or small baby. It's smaller than expected, but it's worth the price. I have not given this to my baby yet as he/she is due March 25th, but once my baby arrives, I'm sure I will add to this!"
4,snuggle pod,really cute. well made. my niece loves it. she takes it everywhere she goes. it's very soft and totally kid friendly.
5,Could not be sweeter!,"The face is sweet, the color is vibrant and the pea pod is unique. How can you go wrong with this sweet toy?"
3,Cute,This is so cute. My little girl is still a bit too small for the toy (6 months) but it is so soft she enjoys sleeping with it and cuddling it.
5,Well loved baby.,I BOUGHT THIS ADORABLE BABY DOLL FOR MY TWIN GRAND-DAUGHTERS WHEN THEY WERE 8 MONTHS. NOW THEY ARE THREE AND THIS COZY DOLL IS BY FAR THEIR FAVORITE. IT IS THE PERFECT SIZE TO HOLD AND CARE FOR.IT IS THE BEST GO TO GIFT FOR LITTLE GIRLS.
4,Very Cute but tiny,"Very cute and soft, perfect for a newborn but I little smaller than I expected. I brought for my 1 year old niece and I think it is a little small for her."
5,Baby Snuggle Must Have,"We got this for our 9 month old for Christmas and it was a HUGE hit. We are buying more of this same style to have for back-up's as it is now a must have anywhere we go. Good quality with the exception of some loose stitching on the satin for the ""pod"" which isn't really an issue since our daughter just likes the baby anyway."
4,Nice toy,"Purchased this for my daughter after purchasing a similar item for a friend's daughter. The doll is soft and cuddly, and the lining of the bunny ""suit"" is also quite pleasant. It's difficult for babies and older infants to put the doll back in the outfit, but it's a cute addition to any doll collection."
3,"Cute, but not really educational","This is a cute doll with lots of tactile simulation, but not lots of education. Soft to hold and touch and even to sleep with."
1,IT'S AN EMPTY POD!,"Buyer Beware you are only getting a POD! NOT a doll IN A POD!!! You must buy the doll separately, and if you do not look closely you will end up will a granddaughter who is very sad! [...]"
4,Cute!,"I thought this was so cute, however, my 18 month old granddaughter would rather play with the peanut than the baby doll. :D"
5,My daughter ADORES hers!,"We got this during cybermonday on a slightly better price, and boy is it ever a hit!!! My 14 months old daughter absolutely adores this baby, has learned to say ""shhhh"" to it and rock it to sleep (its eyes are closed), and hugs it all the time. It's also very very cute and soft. Definitely a hit!"
4,shameless!,This toy is a shameless opportunity for parents to post pics of their kids on the internet! ;-)My sister calls her kid sweet pea so I thought this would be an appropriate toy for her.
4,loved it,"Nice, little and sweet!! really nice for little girls to cuddle and take care! the doll can be taken out of the pod! this is a cutie!!"
2,Wasn't impressed,Ordered this based on the great reviews. Item arrived in a clear plastic bag and was just overall a cheap toy made in China. Yes the fabric is soft but it was no different than a soft blanket or a teddy bear. I don't get the hype. Returned.
5,Sweet Pea,"I just adore this snuggle pod sweet pea thing...this would serve as a gift for my baby, but I find that I just have to give it a rating of 5 even before she appreciates it just because I find it too cute! :) It is a bit smaller than I expected but if you think about who would be using this eventually (babies and rugrats), it is just the perfect huggable size for them ..so I guess that means mommy won't be able to enjoy it as I would if it had been a plush bear. But then again, I wouldn't trade snuggle pod for a stuffed bear anyway. Perfect and safe toy for kids. too cute, washable, well made and is not that expensive. :)UPDATE: my baby girl is now 4 months old, and she just LOVES this toy! :) she likes holding it and I feel safe letting her grab it as she practices her grasping and coordination. she likes ""biting"" the toy which I am perfectly okay with, as I can easily wash the entire thing in the washer and it comes out looking new. great product! highly recommended :)"
2,weird concept,"My little neice was not impressed....doll was cute and soft when in the bug outfit, but you take her out and she has no legs - just a weird tail-like thing.... Not a fan."
2,poor quality,"Very cute doll, but almost as soon as we got it home I noticed there was a little hole under the doll's arm that was leaking stuffing. Also, baby isn't interested in it! Disappointed--this company's toys usually seem to have very good workmanship."
5,"Super Soft, Snuggly little boy doll","Trying to find a favorite small (could fit in my big purse) ""lovie"" for my 10 mo old and was also looking for a boy doll for him. This is a super soft and cuddly lovie, it is super cute too! My son seems to like its little sleeping face and it's ears. When not in it's pocket it fits great in my purse. The whole thing is just the right size for my little guy. Great toy! I would buy this again."
5,Cute!,"This snuggle pod is the cutest thing ever! It's a lot smaller than I initially thought, which is good cause I bought it for an infant. Its so soft and adorable!"
5,Adorable,This came earlier than expected and in great condition. All packaging was intact. I call my niece Peanut and it worked out great that I was able to find this. It is a birthday gift for her. I can't wait to see her open it. Great service.
4,Very cute - baby not interested,Ordered this item for my 9-month old. It is adorable and very well made. My baby is not very interested in it. She doesn't seem to like the feel of it.
1,Didn't care for it,"This blouse was shorter than I hoped. It's barely to my waist. I don't know about you, but with the pants styles being so low cut, I need a longer top. I'm going to send it back for a refund."
3,Interesting perspective,"I thought that this book provided a unique, somewhat unbiased perspective on Ramtha, the school and all the issues about it's origin's, growth, challenges, etc. It would be nice to get an updated version by someone more objective. By that I mean that he came with his own beliefs about religion and it would be interesting to hear more from someone more objective."
5,Great Study on Ramtha's School,Book is well written. I had the privilege of having J. Gordon Melton as one of my Professors in college. He is an incredible speaker and writer. His passion for the subject matter is undeniable.I've read this book several times and find Ramtha's school absolutely fascinating.
3,an OK rock album,"This is a pretty good rock album - cooler than wannabes like the Killers, but not quite as stellar as, say the Arcade Fire or the Futureheads. Favorite tracks were Going Missing and The Coast Is Always Changing. There was only one track I hated, The Night I Lost My Head."
3,Whether you want to dance or want to rock...,"""Signal and Sign"" relies heavily on keyboard effects which give it that new wave era sound; complete with British accent. ""Apply Some Pressure"" utilizes a rapid-fire vocal delivery, a piecing guitar lick, and lots of twangy guitar riffs. An addictive lick that's repeated by both guitar and keyboards dominate ""Postcard of a Painting"". The catchy hook of ""Going Missing"" could easily carry the song as a strong radio track.""Limassol"" uses a lot of electronica type effects to set its up-tempo rhythm. There's sort of a ska feel to the riff in ""The Coast is Always Changing"", but the keyboard changes keep it new wave sounding. ""Once, A Glimpse"" starts off with a surf-beat drum roll that has a similar ""Wipeout""-type guitar run. As the chorus breaks in, so does some guitar fuzz and a thick bass line.The BadNothing notableThe VerdictWhether you want to dance or want to rock out, Maximo Park gives you the opportunity to do both on A Certain Trigger."
4,Very good album,Probably my favorite from this band. Good songs and arrangement of the songs make it great to listen to. Joy.
4,really good,"""Apply Some Pressure"", ""Graffiti"", and the first song that got me hooked, ""Kiss You Better"" are really good.The rest are OK.Three great songs and a bunch of OK ones makes it well worth buying in my opinion."
2,Short walk in this park,"2 1/2Serviceably typical, jagged indie rock maintains the few bells and whistles from slipping into complete generic boredom."
3,collecting maximo dust,"while my romance with this cd was short-lived, the days we shared were among some of the better ones that graced my ipod. average euro-garage-suit & tie-quasi-punk sound. mostly heartbreak tracks to slit your wrists to. also good for strolling through rainy city nights when you just want to strangle a stranger, swiftly running a serated steak knife across his/her pulsing throat."
4,good for their first full length,"this was a good follow up to their ep. Still very strong street punk with good messages, without coming off generic, which is very hard to do these days. if you like the unseen you will like this, pick it up"
1,seems not to work,"This seems not to work. It says the LED should light, but it doesn't. My cell phone was not completely out of charge when I started, so I couldn't tell. I tried emailing the manufacturer at the address on the directions, but the email bounced."
2,"Annoying, thick waistband.","I ordered these pants to replace an old pair of Danskin yoga pants that I absolutely love, which were apparently discontinued. From the website photos and description, this appeared to be the same style. However, where the old pants has a soft but snugly fitted waistband, and more of a drape, these have a thick, wide and firm waistband that is uncomfortable (not tight but just ungiving) and is already starting to 'bend' slightly. In fact, I was thinking of returning them."
3,gapes in the back,"These yoga pants are just ok. They seem to fit and move fine, and the length is fine. But the waistline is large and they therefore gape in the back. Not a huge deal, and I'll still wear them. But they're not my favorite."
3,Not what I had hoped,"The fabric of this pant is okay but the waistband elastic started to roll with the first wearing. At 5'4"" and 117 lbs, a medium should have been a nice fit but looks to be a size too small."
1,Don't Buy,"I bought these earrings for my daughter. They are very pretty and she loved them...untill she wore them once and they broke. The part that goes in your ear bent and broke making them useless. It wasn't worth the hassel of returning them so it was like throwing $20 away! Eventhough they look pretty, the quality is poor. Don't buy."
3,Picture versus product,"These were very attractive on web, and pretty when I received. Nice gift bag and box. Only concern was the ear loops were bent making them appear less than ""sterling."" But I will wear them once adjusted."
4,Very good product that works,I bought this for my husband because he has alot of back pain. he said it helps with his back pain and helps him sleep at night. He thinks it's a very good product. He is ordering more when he runs out. It can cause you to have more trips to restroom though but is good for him though to help him get rid of the build up in his digestive tract.
2,Mag. Oxide in 240 cap bottle,"I ordered one bottle with 240 caps. And the label said 80% Mag. Oxide, 10% Citrate, 10% Malate. Magnesium Oxide has low digestibility. Magnesium Citrate would be the better choice."
5,Good Value,"This was a very good value for the price, as compared to all the chain pharmacies, even walmart.I would recommend it heartily."
1,Not good for my system,"This product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. They Both were made in the citrate form. Unfortunately, I am unable to absorb properly for my system. Although the instructions say to take 2 level teaspoons per serving, I tried 1 teaspoon and soon after, had cramps and had to run to the bathroom. I tried this more than once and the same thing happened. I also do not like the way it does not dissolve in liquids easily. It is gritty and if left in the glass for a few seconds, falls to the bottom.Anyway, thought this would be a good product for me, but is not. I guess I may have to get a softgel or capsule type."
4,They do fit on U posts,"Even though it mentions that it is designed for t posts, they do with a bit of pressure do fit on the normal U posts they sell at home depot and lowe's. Though when we brought our house, there was some leftover U posts that were larger in width that does not accept these insulators.As for how they work, they work as well as expected. It is possible to undo or unlock the locking part which holds the wire though I have a feeling every time I do it with a screwdriver that I am going to break the plastic."
2,"Very thin, more like a skit script","Maybe as a homage to the fact Zweibel wrote skits for Gilda Radner when they both worked on ""Saturday Night Live,"" this whole book is written like a series of skits, some funny, some poignant, just the dialogue without stage direction, details, exposition or anything. So you have to fill in all the rest yourself and imagine you're watching two people on a stage. You learn a little about their relationship, but not much. You have many blanks to fill in.I wouldn't mind seeing this as a play, but as a book, it was kind of hollow."
5,You'll be saying Bunny Bunny too.,"I've been a loyal, devoted fan of Radner's since I was about 8 years old - right before she died. I was overjoyed when this new view of her life from someone so close to her came out. Just reading the overwhelming reviews on the jacket - most from celebrities close to Radner and Zwiebel - is enough to move one to tears. The book is poignant, funny, touching, and moving. Fan or no, a valuable read just for the intense friendship between the two."
3,"Nae the baist, but nae the wurs' nither.","Well, as a Doric-lover, I bought this book looking to find some of the sayings my grandmother used to say to me when I was a 'wee loon'. Some of them are here and they tickle my heart to read and hear them again. I love the language and love the stories that go along with the sayings. With that said, what I find disapointing about this particular book is the lack of context for some of these sayings. Some of them go ""richt o'r me 'ead"" and without context or a description/translation are lost on me. Of course, I know this book is more of a tongue-in-cheek treatise of Doric sayings, but one can learn even from the comedic approach given the context or meaning. One for the collection, but a near miss for education and entertainment.P.S. I love all of Douglas Kynoch's other books. Check out the others first!"
1,Stay Clear of Intex Pools,"Last season we purchased a self filling Intex pool. It was defective and the company said ""sorry you warranty is up"". So we thought we would try a metal frame Intex pool. We got it up filled it with 6700 gallons of water and found it had a seam leak. We drained it, returned it and got another thinking this can't happen again. Well guess what another seam leak. We were smart this time and only filled it up with ten inches of water. Save yourself some stress, time and the need to repair your yard. DON'T GET THESE POOLS!!!"
2,Lost in The Middle Ages,"Based on an article in the AARP Magazine, I almost bought this book sight-unseen. I'm glad my better judgement prompted me to check it out from the library instead. The first three chapters seemed to offer some optimistic possibilities. Beyond that point, however, I had to pull out my old graduate school copy of Hall & Lindzey and reacquaint myself with Jungian theory. I admire Dr. Hollis' professional expertise but I'm afraid he lost me somewhere along the increasingly muddy path he'd mapped out. I find that the only thing that sticks in my mind from reading this book was a snide comment he made about the banality of ""I'll Be Home For Christmas""."
1,Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life,"The title, ""Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life"" promises some hope but the book does not deliver. This book contains very few good insights, is hard to understand, full of psycho-bable, and technical jargon, and implies that everone needs a therapist just to get through life. It is a wast of time for the most readers."
3,Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life,Can not really say much about this yet. Catching up on everything else I've had started. Bought this book on the advise of a well trusted friend.
1,ridiculous,when you reach the second half of life you need ginko biloba to remember what you did fifteen minutes ago. The meaning has always been there.Remember the golden rule - love your neighbor as yourself. Don't waste your money. I read this book and gave it as a gift. I liked it. But I can't remember anything about it!
3,The luxury of finding meaning,"At a time when many of us are constrained by potential or real economic pressures, it's difficult to envision breaking out of constricting roles and living freely into our soul's passion and wisdom.BUT, I have been wrestling...and blessed by this book. I particularly resonated with the section on making ""deals"" with God and the universe (pp 83-84). Big deal maker and prayer chatterer that I am...thinking that perhaps if I distract God, my shortcomings will be overlooked...some of my most painful and profound learnings have been around trying to give up my magical thinking."
4,Physical book not as expected,"The book was used but reported to be like new. I was disapointed to see thatappoximately 15 pages into the book, a paragraph had been underlined in pen and askterisked. I might have been able to overlook this had the underlined paragraph been something that was of interest to me but it was not. I had purchased this book to read and then loan to client's in my psychotherapy practice and now I am reluctant to do so let they belive that I am endorsing the the statements in the above mentioned underlined paragraph. I would expect that the seller would have indicated that there was markings in the book. I would not have purchased this particular copy and feel that it was misleading. It's far to much trouble to return the book which arrive just as I was leaving for vacation a few weeks ago."
3,difficult read,"The information is great however, it is really difficult to read. The words are large and i have to constantly get out my dictionary. A little disappointed. wish it was more down to earth."
5,Great motivation for putting my midlife crisis in the rearview mirror,"I have not quite finished this book yet and who could blame me? It is so packed with information and motivation to change our lives. I saw the message coming for a ""wake up call"" in the first pages, but at this point I have a fire under my tail to really create a new life.Understand please, that I am significantly satisfied with my life to this point and cherish my children, marriage and ego based life. But, hey, I know when I am leaving value on the sidelines and this book reminds me that the Soul's calling is greater than my ego centric life.Here I go on the second half journey toward a conscious life and I will give you all an update when I have finished the book.Thanks Dr. Hollis for this inspiration."
3,Friend referred it to me,"Pretty good (need to read again) - kind of academic, not a casual read. However, info is well researched and I'm looking forward to delving into it again."
5,How to manage midlife crises,"According to Jung, life has two acts. In act one, an individual goes off into the world to stake out a place for himself. But in act two, which happens after the age of 35, he begins to turn inwards and work on what he has neglected within himself. This is what this book is about. Dr. James Hollis, a Jungian analyst, discusses how to make this transition in the second half of life."
4,Zircon Ultrasonic Measure,"Its a simple tool, and easy to use. Its also very light, but bulky to carry around. The area and volume calculations are as accurate as one would want for a house/apartment/small office use... Drawback: no pointing device, therefore if there is a column or beam above, then its difficult to use in tight spots to get a first shot clear measurement. Overall, worthwhile purchase."
4,Fun,"My son finds this video to be very fun to watch. It does catch your eye...for adults it may seem a little out there, but it holds my son's attention. Very educational and since it puts music to the letters it makes it a fun way to learn the alphabet, sounds of letters, etc..."
4,Toddler loves it,This is wonderful. My almost 3 year old will ask for this specifically and really gets into it repeating the words and everything. He already knows the letters and sounds so this was a great next step for him!
3,original band shoulda made it big,"Divine Weeks was a very popular LA band in the 1980s. They had a charismatic singer, tight rhythm, killer guitar, and put together some awesome songs. They were a bit like U2 with a grungy edge. Then they had a split with their original guitarist. Sadly, they were never the same. This CD captures the great songs, but with the replacement guitar. Having heard them at their peak, this sounds a little flat to me. Still good, but not great, work."
5,Exquisito!,"Como han pasado los anos dice una de las canciones de este hermoso album. cuantos? quizas cuarenta o veinta que mas da!no sabe duda que este tipo de recopilaciones deben estar reservadas solo para los grandes como Dyango.Quien hace gala de una voz fuerte e invencible de grado profesional casi imposible de igualar.Este es un album exquisito. Quizas no tan popular como sus otros trabajos, pero realmente elevado por el horizonte hasta llegar con los dioses, todas las piezas son ejecutadas con maestria y soberbia de la buena. pocos artistas pueden hacer esto, sin embargo el mercado esta inundando de imitaciones aburridisimas, pero este album no puede estar de mas en ningun hogar."
4,An intimate journey,"Andrew Cowan's newest novel begins in sadness: the narrator Paul addresses his dead son Euan with a muted sorrow that finds the beauty in the most simple of scenes. This quietly emotional novel continues on a journey of the past to explore Paul's relationship with Euan as well as with others integral to his life, including his own father. Illuminated by his grief for Euan, Paul's life comes into sharp focus as the author leads the reader inexorably to the conclusion.This is a purely literary work, recommended for those who love language and the meanings of gestures, who like to discover greater truths through the details of ordinary lives. Cowan's prose is lyrical yet clear, at times self-conscious but always impressive. His abundant talents for literary fiction are on full display in this book. However, if you are searching for an uplifting book with a compelling plot, I recommend that you look elsewhere."
4,Pre Columbo Falk,"Like man, dig it. A young Peter Falk, (32, though he looks younger)complete with that glass-eyed stare plays the mob-like pseudo beatnik Nico. Along with his Ivy League looking alcoholic pal they feed a delivery boy a hamburger full of ground glass and the action ensues. The boy dies, and his brother seeks revenge. Lots of scenes in the beat club, chicks dancing with themselves, and plenty of beat haircuts, poetry, dark rimmed glasses and goatees. A must-have for your beat collection. COLUMBO: ""Pardon me, is this the scene of the murder? It must be, there's a lot of dead bodies laying around."""
1,"Unproven, unsafe, and found to be dangerous.","The book jacket describes Phen/fen in these terms: ""These totally safe, fully endorsed medications are NOT amphetamines and are NOT addictive...""These medicines never were proven safe or approved by the FDA for combination treatment. Nor should it be much of a surprise that they were proven dangerous. The drug company's lawyers and their medical spin doctors would confuse the issue of just how dangerous these medicines are, but their danger is not limited to heart valve damage, or PPH. Others have suffered from memory loss and depression. Some have have experienced psychosis and suicidal depression coming off of these drugs.It would please me, someone who experienced some of these symptoms, to see Dr. Lamm and Simon and Schuster share in the staggering financial liability because of the Phen/fen disaster.Something tells me that Dr. Lamm et. al. will slither away from legal responsiblity, but lets hope not from moral responsibilty."
2,Rusting grommets,"similar to all products made in china, quality is an issue: the grommets are made out of iron and they start rusting at first contact with water. try to buy another brand if you can."
2,poor quality,"I purchased 3 rafts for my nephews for my pool, the rafts lasted less than 1 week. The boys enjoyed them while they lasted. Definitely did not get my money out of them."
2,dissapointed,My grandson only weighs 40 lbs and he was getting on the float and had split the the seam of the float. I was hoping that they would last longer then they did...
3,"Very Supportive, but Oddly Designed.","This is probably the most supportive sports bra I've ever owned! But the ""divider"" that separates tends to not stay in place and pokes out, giving the front of my shirt a odd look. I'm always having to adjust my bra throughout the day which is a big hassle. I continue to use it because I very much like the support, but I'll be looking for something else that separates properly without looking weird."
2,"Great bra, but size mislabeled...no customer service!!","I have this bra in nude...LOVE it!! Comfy, cool, etc., etc. I ordered it in black for a special weekend occasion...when I went to wear it, the sizing was at least 3 inches off & I had no choice but to wear an extender...it worked, but not well. The following day (Sunday), I sent an email explaining the situation to HerRoom...3 days later I finally get a response saying that I wore the bra, so I'm stuck with it & sometimes bras just come in different sizes. Really?!!? We're talking 3 INCHES (at least!!)!! This isn't the first time I've gotten a raw deal with this company (prior I bought undies...took them out of bag to find a hole & never wore them...they wouldn't accept them back, since they were out of the bag!?). So again, I love the bra, but would NEVER buy from HerRoom again."
2,torpedo boobs!,"I wear a 34DD and always wear minimizers. I need an athletic bra for the summer to wear with tank tops as i am running around with my 4 year old constantly. I ordered two different bras as they had similar reviews. This one makes your boobs very pointy...like I said...like torpedo boobs....it also did not squeeze them in like I would have hoped. The other bra I bought is the Natori medium control underwire sportsbra. It was a bit more expensive, however it gives you the support and the comfort you need...as well as a very flattering back line which is hard to come by when you have a larger chest weighing them down. I would pass on this one and buy the Natori!!!"
1,terrible,I can't believe this is marketed as a sports bra. It does nothing to prevent bounce. It's being returned right away! Really disappointed.
5,Great bra for med and low intensity workouts,"I love this bra. I have it in both black and white. I wear the 36G and I use the black for outdoorsy stuff like backpacking and canoe tripping and I wear the white for medium to low intensity workouts like strength training and zumba. I've tried jogging in it (like across the backyard) and it doesn't support me as well as my Enell which I use for running and soccer. My only complaint is that the underwire started poking me in the side on the 4th day of my 7 day canoe trip this summer. I think it stretches a little with continuous wearing and swimming in it. This didn't happen when I wore it for a few days straight backpacking. I don't sleep in it, but I will probably take a 2nd bra to rotate daily on my next canoe trip. The best thing though is that even though I wore it for a few days straight (which could be kinda gross), it didn't smell and it seemed as good as new after I washed it at home."
3,effective but very high cut,"I'm 44DD so I wear bras all the time. This one is effective, in that it lifts, and it gives good posture because if you slouch the wires stick out in the front - very unattractive, so I find myself sitting straight. It's comfortable but seriously not sexy, and comes up very high. It wears comfortably under my gym gear and I bought it for a gym bra but it's not very versatile, as it shows under most of my other tops (and they're not particularly low cut)Edited to add, it wasn't flexible enough to be comfortable in exercise class and I've just thrown it out. Didn't work at all for me."
4,CoolMax Underwire Sports Bra,"The main reason that I bought this bra was for it's CoolMax fabric... it really wicks away the moisture. However, please be aware that the bottom band is not made of coolmax... and that's one area that does collect some moisture! I like the support that it offers - enough to keep me from bouncing uncomfortable, but not enough to make me feel imprisoned. Some reviewers complained about the pointed cups.... that isn't a problem with me as I'm from the generation that bought bras to ""LIFT & SEPARATE"" :-)I also really like the adjustable straps, as I'm extra tall, and most sports bras have too short of straps for me. If the bra survives several washings, I plan on buying more of these nice bras."
4,Good value,"This sports bra is good for moderate exercise or activity but I don't think it would offer enough support for some very active sports. I am glad I have a gaited horse and not a rough riding one! That said, it is a good value, well made and very comfortable."
3,Not quite as I'd hoped.,"I am not a fan of underwires, so I was impressed by others' reviews of this bra, and decided to try it. I have worn it running once, but found it doesn't cinch enough to reduce upper-chest bounce. The underwire is also digging just a little on the outsides. I am an odd size, though, and am still hoping it will be comfortable after I make some alterations."
1,Ouch! And holy torpedo boobs batman!,"I really wanted this bra to work, but I just tried it on, and I am promptly returning it. It was very uncomfortable and just didn't fit me right. Too big in some places, too small in others. The fabric seems like it would keep you dry, but it feels funny on my skin. I am a 40DD and I was hoping I could use this for running, but I put it to the up and down the stairs test and did not feel at all supported. Maybe there's no such thing for big girls like me! As someone else mentioned, it does come up really high in the front too. My biggest complaint though is the way it made me look! Seriously pointed cone boobs going on. My search for the perfect sports bra continues..."
5,Great service and price.,I recommend them to everybody. Got it faster than promised. The price was lower than I could imagine. The quality of the product is top rate.
3,Good instruction... just disappointed...,"Like I said before this is a great instructional video. It's like having the instructor in your house, but nothing like going to the mat yourself and learning hands on. It has the SAME ten minutes introduction with basic instruction of break falls and rolls, as the first. Biggest disappointment is now your 30 minutes of instruction shrunk to less than 20 minutes of instruction. AND then you get ten minutes of advertisement. I was really hoping to get different advertisements per volume, but no luck. But in defense they do make it up in the third volume with 40 minutes of instruction. The instructor knows his stuff. But is it worth $30 for 20 minutes?"
2,The sin of moral equivalence,"As early as the first page of this work Eagelton shows his political colors. He accuses the Pentagon and the United States of being guilty of terror in the same way as those Islamic groups which deliberately target civilians are. This is an irresponsible and mistaken claim.In fact Eagelton's method of mixing literary references with matter- of - fact happenings give a sense that he has no real experience , no true understanding of the subject. The gruesome cruel deliberate targeting of civilians for political purposes is not much illuminated by abstruse and complicated jargon- making.Terror's is not holy. It is Evil."
5,poetry at it's best--you will give thanks,"Lovely, thoughtful, deep, unusual, musings on painful or fascinating contradictions...SO EASY to READ and UNDERSTAND. You will pause and read again if poetry is ""your thing."" Written in Polish language on one side of the page and truly beautiful English translation on the other.Wislawa died in February of 2012 and I miss her, even though I only met her on line."
1,This book just didn't do it for me.,"I quess I was thinking this book would be more like a traditional memoir. It didn't seem to go anywhere. The author just kept describing things without much rhyme or reason. I thought it would follow a more traditional timeline from beginning to end, but the story was a little ""all over the place"". I know this book got good reviews, but I found it a bit boring."
4,"Great writing, not what I expected","I was looking for some escapist reading to daydream far away from my life in midtown manhattan. I came across recommendations for this book and ordered it along with ""A Place in the Woods"" by Helen Hoover. I started reading Louise Rich's book with hunger for a story that would whisk me away to life in the deep woods, but the Q&A type format by chapter felt a bit stinted for that purpose. Her writing is wonderful as are the anecdotes; it just wasn't the type of narrative I was looking for at the time. I was glad to have Helen Hoover's book in hand as well because that story fit the bill perfectly."
1,Quite disappointed. Only worked over distance about 5 feet.,"Really wanted to like this. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. Receiver lost contact with the transmitter anytime I went more than 5 or 7 feet from it. This was line of sight, indoors, with no objects between them.Changed batteries and reset device several times with no change.I had originally purchased this to make a roast beef for easter brunch. Because the roast took about 6 hours to cook, I planned to put it in the oven late at night and have the receiver wake me when the appropriate temps were hit. Fortunately, I decided to just make the roast on Saturday or I would have just slept all night and awoken to a VERY well done costly hunk of meat, as the receiver lost contact in about 15 minutes.I wish I could give 2,3,or 4 stars but unfortunately it just didn't work at all."
5,PROBES,Love this product. We are a competition BBQ team and they work great when you have several meats that need to be monitored at the same time.
1,Absolute junk,"When I first got this it was a pain to get it to work correctly. My wife was the only one who could get it to work. When it worked it was great and was accurate. Now it doesn't even work no matter what we do to it. Also, you shouldn't have to look at instructions to figure out how to set up a kitchen thermometer..."
2,Maverick et-7,I have tried to like this thermometer but like others have stated this unit is unpredictable with its wireless transmittions. I have over cooked food due to the fact that I did not realize that the unit stopped transmiting the temperature. Its a great feature of being able to monitor 2 types of meats. The reason I wanted this unit was because of that and being wireless. I guess if you dont mind about the wireless feature then by all means go for it.
2,Poor Life,"The first Maverick I recieved never worked. It was promptly replaced, but after one cookout one of the probes quit working it then just became a single wireless thermometer. After another cookout the wireless quit working. I'm not one to complain so I just went to wally world and got a brand that worked."
3,Check Probes before use - good thing you have 2 temp. probs,"I was so excited to get this device. Each year I cook a Prime Rib - (bone in). My family really like it rare. Unfortunately I had bad probes or 1 bad probe. 1 of the probes was anywhere from7' to 23' off from the other probe. The company was great is sending me 2 new probes, but that was after cooking this special Xmas dinner, so check out the probes before using them."
1,Maverick Remote read Thermometer a dissappointment,"This unit is suppossed to have a range of 100 feet but loses communication with nothing but open air between transmitter and receiver at 50 to 75 feet. Nice features on the receiver but My main reason for purchase was the remote capability, which does not work well. I believe my wireless router for the computer may be the cause, but that should have been taken into account in the design of the unit. A stronger transmitter or better receiver would make this into a 5 star unit."
3,"Useful, but could be better.","While this thermometer does do what it supposed to, generally, it could be better. The range from the probe to the remote is quite short. I couldn't use it 40' away, through one wall. The interface is not very intuitive, but it will do what you want, eventually. It is not particularly accurate either. I calibrated to boiling water, which it placed at 208 F at 3000' elevation, somewhat low. The probe is not useful on thinner cuts of meat like a T-bone as it gets heated outside the meat and gives a false high reading. It does work where you need it the most: turkeys, roasts, etc. As much as I complained, I would consider buying another if pressed due to it's low price and the fact that the short-comings are not ""fatal""."
1,Out of Box Failure,Alarm for timer and temperature failed to function right out of the box. I called the importer (Maverick) and they wanted me to mail everything back to them at my cost for an evaluation. I'm just going to count this buying decision as a total loss because I don't want to gamble the additional shipping cost on another out of box failure.
3,careful with the probes,the wireless thermometer functioned perfectly and the steaks and chicken were done to perfection. We grilled some Salmon to 145 and it came out great (not one of the meat choices but you can set the device to beep at any temperature you want). Be careful of the probes because if you soak them in water or over heat them (over 400) they will short out and you'll have to replace them.
1,Didn't think I'd get a crappy one,"Others talked about how the probes were bad and wouldn't work. I've had this type of therm. before, so I know the benefits, so I decided to roll the dice. Certainly those had to be lemons and mine would work fine. WRONG. Both my probes don't even come close to each other - one is 40 deg. higher than the other.The remote has a HARD TIME syncing with the base while only 5-10 feet away, much less out on the patio.I've got to call the manuf. and see what they'll do. Didn't use it initially and am past my 30 day amazon return window.BUYER BEWARE"
1,Did not work from day 1,May have been just a bad item but it did not work from day 1. Would not transmit the current temp of the meat I was trying to cook.
1,terrible,"took a chance on purchasing this even though some of the reviews were bad.Needless to say the wireless transmitter and receiver never stayed connected to each other if they were over a couple feet apart.Should have taken advice from the reviews and not wasted my money,now i have to pack it back up and return for refund,dont waste your money and have to do the same."
3,UDS Smoker monitor,I did a fair amount of research before I bought this device.It works fairly well and its very convenient compared to manually monitoring my temps.My unit will randomly stop communicating requiring that I shut it down and resynch.I wish I had window shopped a bit longer
1,Garbage,"I've had this unit for 3 years now and it really never worked right from day one. The probes and the remote unit are fine. They work as you would expect, and it is accurate. The problem comes in with the wireless unit that you would carry with you. First it's big, too big to carry really. But the real downside, it never works. I can be 6 feet away and it will loose reception, sometimes it will get it back, most times not though.. For any overnight smokes it's useless. I could not recommend this to anyone. Look at different models"
1,Horrible item,"I ordered this item to be used with my smoker. The smoker is line of sight and only about 8 feet away. Even side-by-side, the transmitter could not talk to the receiver. I sent it back, Amazon replaced it, and the new item had the same problem. I returned it for a refund."
4,Nearly perfect,"I have had no problems using this and am very pleased with the results. I have had no difficulties with the wireless function and it has worked all the way to my neighbor's house, through several walls. The only incident was completely my fault whe I had taken the probe out of a hot piece of meat, then forgot that it was hot, and grabbed on to it a few minutes later which burned my fingers slightly.Pros: I really find the ability to manually select an exact temperature really improves the versitality of this device. It was a pleasant surprise to me when I began using it.Cons: The beeper could be louder as I have had to be careful and keep it near me or keep my music at a normal voulume to be sure I woudl hear it."
5,Must-have for Barbecue.,"At first, it worked very well. I was able to monitor temperatures from my basement using the receiver with the smoker outside at ground level. I do a lot of low-and-slow smoking and was really stoked about this product - no need to check the temperature every fifteen minutes.At some point, the receiver just stopped seeing the signal from the transmitter. The transmitter still works as a dual-probe thermometer, which is useful, but I have to check it visually now.When I first started using this product, I could use the probes monitor the temperature of the meat AND the internal temperature of the smoker from inside my home. Not so much after a few months. Looks like the best bet may be a network-connected base unit transmitting to the home network."
2,Complicated to use,"This seemed like it would solve the problem of having to babysit the smoker that is located on the lower level of our property....it has the capacity to to be perfect except for the fact that it beeps continually every 2-5 min until you keep shutting it off....can be quite aggravating....but as far as keeping track of the temperature, that part works great."
2,Junk,I cook 5 or 7 time a week 12 months of the year on and off my grill.I have sent 4 unites back to the manufacture because bad readings.Temperatures off by 15 or 20 degrees.I have under and over cooked many a dish and have finely decided to dump the unites in the garbage.Don't waist your money.
1,Complicated,"This thermometer is so complicated to operate that you would have to be a rocket scientist . . . plug this in first, flip that switch second, insert this probe here that one there, all the while standing on one foot and hopping to the tune of America the Beautiful. I wanted a ""plug and play"" thermometer, not something I had to program!"
1,Doesnt Work,"From the first day this didnt work. The thermometer works that sticks intot the meat, but the remote device does not work properly. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt (after burning two pieces of meat). the reote control wont work unless its within 5 feet. otherwise it will lose signal and you will burn your meat. I paid up for this device, but my $10 non-wireless one works so much better. Wish i could return this one. Dont do it."
1,Don't Work,"I purchased this item just for the dual probe. I received it in the mail at my office I opened it up to test it and it 'seemed' to work just fine. I held one probe in my hand and left the other on my desk. The remote unit registered about 96 on my hand and 70 on my desk. So I pack everything back up and then last night I get it out to try it ""for real"" and I couldn't get the darn things to link. They would link for about 10 seconds and then the remote unit would light up like the forth of July and then be reset. Finally by the end of it all I couldn't get them to link at all. I ended up just using the transmitter unit to monitor temps (it has a small LCD window that displays only the temp). So the remote unit in my experience is just garbage.I did everything I could to fix it (ie new batteries in both units, reset mulitiple times, proper turn on sequence, etc).Don't waste your money on this unit."
2,It's ok,"I've had this for three years. It worked ok for while. Now the remote module won't communicate with the base thermometer, which kind of defeats the purpose. They still work fine as two separate thermometers. However, now the probes are starting to fail. The probe wires are pretty flimsy in my opinion and shouldn't be subjected to extreme heat like open flames.I would give it 2.5 stars but 2 will have to do."
4,Works as advertised,"This is the second one I've owned, the other one died after a several years. This one is better and comes with two cables as opposed to the one sent in my original one. (I believe it was probably the cable part that actually failed in my old thermometer)All in all, it does exactly as advertised. You have to turn on the sensor and the remote within seconds of each other and then it gives you an accurate reading. I like it especially when barbecuing outdoors in the winter. You can stay inside and the remote will notify you when the meat is done"
2,Very disappointed,"Admittedly, I read the reviews and had certain expectations. However, I found the instructions lacking and terribly confusing and the thermometer cheaply made. Perhaps if I had already used a similar product, I would have had an easier time. But I doubt it. My husband decided to try it to see for himself and came away from his session with it feeling exactly the same way I did. Do not waste your money."
4,Perfect Temperature equals Perfect Results,"The ET-7 Wireless Thermometer is a perfect grilling tool if you want your grill to turn out perfect results. The wireless feature makes standing over the grill constantly, a thing of the past. The settings for the verious types of meats and level of cooking for each makes using the product a breeze. Read the instructions carefully regarding connection and do not submerse the temperature probes in water as they may not function properly if they contain water. The dual probes allow you to cook two different meats and/or different temperatures for personal taste preferences. With this tool, I have been able to master the grilling process and produce results that a master chef would envy. A must have for any serious griller!"
2,Not user friendly,"It did not work for me. Not user friendly. After this unrewarding trial, I have come to the conclusion that a thermometer with a long probe is the right way to go for a single, fast, and accurate measurement of your grilled item. It would be much cheaper as well."
2,"C'mon, 100ft Range?","I only bought this for the remote feature, the rest of the stuffs are of no interest to me. They should stop advertising the 100 ft range remote. Because in realty, this thing does not work beyond 4 meters."
3,very limited range,"The first unit received would not transmit a signal (30 feet) consistantly from my barbeque to my kitchen. I returned it and received another which seems to maintain an uninterrupted signal for the 30 minutes of outside cooking. An audible alarm which alerts one that the signal has been lost would be a vital improvement to this gadget. In the mean time, I will check the signal often and regularly. The reported temperatures seem to be accurate, the instructions are straigtforward and the two probes are handy."
1,Cheap Product - Very Disappointed,This product is rated up to 500F. I was catering an event yesterday and preheated my grill to 325F and within two minutes of placing the meat and probe on the grill the wires burt and melted where the wire meets the probe. I can fully understand why this seller is rated 3 stars. I was cooking a dinner party for 50 and had to wing it on the meat because of this cheap product. It is a rip off for >41.00 with shipping.
2,No 100ft range for remote,"Received this product and used it the following day to do a 20 hour slow cook on my Big Green Egg. I was really excited to not have to go outside and check on my temps, as well as, having an alarm if it got too hot.Unfortunately, it would not stay synced when I was inside the house. According to the advertising, it should work up to 100ft. My cooker was setup out on my patio, with the pager on my kitchen table, about 15 ft away. It would not work, not even with the sliding glass door open.I will say that the probes worked great and I was able to monitor the temperatures from the remote, I just had to constantly get up and check on it. I gave it two stars, because the wireless should work from such a close range. Over I was not happy with the product."
1,Does Not Work,I tried the unit for the first time last night. It worked for about 10 minutes and then the units stopped communicating. They were only 30-40 feet apart. I reset them both and they worked for about 10 minutes and then the receiving unit stuck on 137 degees. I went and looked at the sending unit as I was curious as to why the meat was not getting warmer. The sending unit said the meat was 150 degrees. I bought one from Williams Sonoma five years ago and worked fine for all of that time.
2,Not as advertised,"I've had this for 31 days and have not been impressed with this Thermometer. The manufacturer states '100 wireless distance and i'm seeing '15-'20, which is useless for keepig track inside of the house. Setting the temps or times is confusing and not user friendly. Decided to return today and realized its been 31 days and paying shipping and 20% off of the original price doesn't make it worth my time, so I'll continue to use it. I don't recommend this to prospective buyers. Price was too good to be true."
1,No response from customer service,I am having a problem with the probes. One of them registers 200 degrees at all times even when it is in the open air. Their customer service site says they will respond to inquiries within 24 hours. I have sent two separate messages asking for assistance and I have not received a return email.Maverick ET-7 Remote-Check Wireless Thermometer With 2 Probes
1,does not work very well,will not work over twenty feet away going thru one exterior wall. it will change modes all by it self i would not recommend this product
1,did not work,it did not work wright would not work for two meats as far as this goes a piece of s***
5,makes the bbq a joy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i love this product. I stick the little poker into my meat and I can walk away. I like to leave the meat on the grill over a low heat or actually I tend to leave one burner on and the next one off. Kind of a stagger method with my four burners. I dont leave my meat visually unattended when the flame is direct. So you can only imagine how handy this little guy is. I can go inside watch TV and never worry. It is so easy to use. Just read the directions carefully and you will have no problems. GREAT GIFT A JOY TO USE
1,Receiver fails to receive signals after 5 minutes,"The receiver and transmitter successfully contacted each other upon power-up.But much like several of the other reviewers, I was unable to make the receiver consistently receive signals for more than 5 minutes, even when the transmitter was 2 feet away sitting on the same table.Perhaps the only positive aspect of this product is that it was easy to debug: both the transmitter and the receiver flash an icon during the transmit/receive process, so it was clear when the receiver was ""missing"" the transmission.It is a shame that this product does not work as advertised by its maker, because its alleged feature set is just what I needed."
2,You get what you pay for?,"I purchased this thermometer as a replacement for another one we had that broke. This one is worse than the last one. The remote sensor never did work and now that we've had it for a couple years, it won't give an accurate temperature. Tonight, I checked the temperature of a pork tenderloin that had been in the oven for more than the recommended amount of time (45 minutes for a 2 lb. tenderloin) and the temperature went from 140 to 103 to 123 to 149 to 119. In a matter of 10 seconds. Then the fun started, it started blinking L L L - I have no idea what it means, but it's been doing that for the past year or so.I'm just not impressed. I'm actually on Amazon looking for a better thermometer that will last us more than 18 months."
3,somewhat disapointed,"Received product right away. Directions not very good, does not explain to much on unit. Temperature does not work on base unit most of the time and range is not good at all."
2,very unprecise and the range is a joke,"the product is a wonderful idea and has great potential, sadly it's range is so low that I basically have to sit next to the smoker.The second issue is that it's extremely un precise by about 10-12 degrees, which makes it an adventure to cook food in a save way."
3,Not impressed,"Bought this thermometer to use with a recently purchased propane smoker. Since temperature control is critical in smoking I thought having the capability to monitor remotely would be ideal. The device is accurate and easy to set and use, my chief complaint is that the signal from transmitter to receiver was lost at least twice each time I used it so far. Distance was not a factor as the smoker was on my patio and the receiver was in the kitchen 24 feet and one wall away. I tried rechargeable ni-cad batteries but it didn't make any difference, signal was still lost. I can live with the inconvenience of resetting the device since my primary concern is smoker temp as opposed to meat temp (I time the cook and check with a digital hand held when the time is up), but the point is that the device does not perform as claimed.I would not recommend this device unless you can get a good price on it. I paid about $44 for it so it didn't break me."
1,Bought two. Both don't work.,"I purchased two of these because I run multiple grills and smokers and would like to be able to maintain multiple temperatures. Out of the box, the two that I purchased wouldn't work. I was OK with the fact that they wouldn't transmit at the claimed 100' but at under 5' seems a bit ridiculous. I can get one sensor to work off one probe but not the other. I have a single sensor unit that I purchased from Meijer years ago and it still works fine. I thought this would be a great addition to my cooking arsenal. It wasn't. Should have paid attention to the reviews. Would not purchase again. Would not recommend."
2,Digital Meat Thermometer w/remote Display,This is the 4th different meat thermometer w/remote display I have owned and I would have to say it's the least effective one. I bought it because it came with 2 probes and I can purchase them separately if needed later. I have found that the remote unit won't update if I get it more than 2-3' from the sensor which defeats the purpose of having a remote unit. My past units (different brands) have allowed me to go into my home while something is on the grill and I could monitor the temperature from there.
1,Beware ... product not as advertised!,"This product was advertised to go over temps of 500 degrees, however the fine print in the literature that came with it said that if the temp goes over 480 degrees it will damage the unit. We returned the item for a refund and purchased a different thermometer."
1,Receiver looses connectivity,The probes and digital display on the transmitter work well but the receiver looses connectivity (every time). I tried this at several locations. Finally placing the receiver less that 12-inches away from the transmitter. Very disappointed.
1,Returned the item,"I had to return this item. It never worked correctly from the beginning. Setup was pretty easy. Simply follow the directions. The remote transmitter never worked more than 15 feet from the receiver. The transmitter unit never registered the temperature correctly. Transmission of temperature had a lag in it,which was long enough to cause a problem of burning something up. The documentation says it is not recommended to use the probes in a covered grill."
5,Works Great,I thought this might be an overkill but now that I have it I really like it. I replaced a digital thermometer and now I can just put the probe in the meats and not have to remember to keep checking the temperature. This has more setup time and the probe is in the way when you turn the meat but to me it is worth it.
1,Didn't last long,"I purchased the Marverick ET-7 two years ago. It was touted as one of the best units out there. Out of the box, the remote system did NOT work. I didn't return it because I thought I'd just monitor it from the base unit. When not in use, I removed the batteries and stored it in a cool, dry place. After about 4 smoking sessions, I decide to smoke a turkey yesterday for Easter. One probe registered over 300 degrees and the other registered over 192 degrees. It is shot. My wife had a cheap Wal-Mart temp probe she bought for under $20 that we've had for over 10 years. Worked like a charm. Don't waste your money on this supposedly great gadget. Get the cheapest monitor you can find and always have a spare on hand."
3,Not terrible,"Worked great for a few months. I used this on a smoker and liked the idea of having two probes, one for the meat and one to measure the actual temperature inside the smoker. I had a few things come out a little over done, so I put both probes in a glass of water. One of the probes measured 8 degrees more than the other. 8 degrees might not seem like much, but it is the difference between medium and leather."
2,Read the reviews and think twice,"I ordered this to go with my new Big Green Egg...after reading some of the reviews on wireless thermometers I liked the idea of one probe in the meat and one on the cooking surface to accurately measure cooking temp.After receiving and experimenting with the Maverick ET-7 I found that:1 - with both probes plugged in and reading the same temperature, they were 2 degrees different2 - ""instant read"" took at LEAST 45 seconds and many times longer3 - it was very DIFFICULT to get the wireless unit to sync to the base3 - if you turn the unit off you have to reset the clock!Reading the product reviews always helps me so I hope this helps with your decision."
2,Save your money,"This unit has no range whatsoever. If I move ten feet away, direct line of sight, no metal in the way and it loses communication. And to top it off, it never updates the temperature so you can tell you have lost communication. One of my biggest wastes of money to date."
1,Avoid at all cost,This is the worst wireless device I have ever owned. You'll be lucky to keep the transmitter and receiver linked for more than 30 minutes. I even went so far as to return it to the manufacturer for a new one. The new one is just as bad as the old one. As I write this I'm trying to use it along with another brand (NU-Temp). The NU-Temp is on a pork roast and the Remote Check is on a whole chicken. The Remote check lost its connection with the transmitter after about 10 minutes. The NU-Temp is still working perfectly after an hour of use. Needless to say I will never buy this brand again.
1,Don't believe the claims,"This thing only worked to about 25 feet and that was outside...when i went indoors, forget it. If your grill is sitting outside and you are inside, you better be close...like 15 feet max if you're going thru ONE WALL....think you're going to sit in the living room, watch the game and watch the temps on your backyard grill?...it ain't happening! Tried new batteries same results.Doesn't live up to claims."
1,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ACCURATE,"I got this thing ripped it open like it was christmas morning, grabbed some batteries and turned it on to see the display reading from one probe 74 deg. and the other 61 deg. I am the kind of smoking guru that cooks to temp. and that is a big 13 deg. swing from 2 probes sitting on the same counter. So I fire up my smoker and test it against my other thermometers and both readings were wrong. I purchased this for the remote display but it does me no good if its not accurate. Try undercooking your pork and see how your evening goes."
4,Works well once you get past the turn-on delay,"The only thing I don't like about this is, when you turn on the base, it defaults to looking for a reading from the remote piece. This results in a 30+ second delay to actually use the timer or get it to read the sensor plugged into the main unit. I think this goes away if you use the standby mode, but then you don't get a lot of battery life. That aside, I really like how this works and it has definitely helped cook a perfect roasted chicken!"
3,NOT TOOO BAD...BUT,"This unit works well within certain limitations. It has all the ""doneness"" temps pre programmed and you cannot change them. Poultry is cooked to 180 wether you like it or not. I use the beef setting to get my preferred doneness of 160.The probe doesnt last long, I've had mine for a couple years now and am on the 3d probe. You have to order them from the manufacturer and are not covered under warrenty for some reason. At $10 a pop plus shipping, it makes this unit fairly expensive. If I was sure I was getting something better I would try another brand but all the wireless ones seem to have one problem or another. This one is ok, not great, but ok.UPDATE: This unit finally died completely. Gonna try some other brands, not too happy with this one.ANOTHER UPDATE: Check out the CHANEY BBQ WIRELESS THERMOMETER, inexpensive and it works."
2,Maverick ET-7 Remote-check Wireless Thremometer.,Maverick ET-7 Remote-check Wireless Thremometer. It is not user friendly so we did not use it with our oiless turkey fryer.
1,Worked for a Couple of months then failed,"I now have two different Maverick Thermometers. This and an ET-73. Each of them worked good for the first 60 days then quit. Their customer service is poor and the wireless technology they use is intermittent at best.I think I speak for the thousands of folks who have invested alot of time and energy into Eggs, Smokers, etc and I'd like to see a top quality wireless unit even if it is 3x as much up front."
1,Extremely disappointing,"My BIG issue with this is that it goes into sleep mode way too quick. The fact it goes to sleep at all is annoying enough. But, when I am cooking a brisket for a few hours, it is insane to have to go out to the transmitter and reset it every 30 minutes. Rather defeats the purpose of REMOTE. I would pass on this POC and find something different. Wish I had."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"At first it worked. The temp was a little slow to update on the main handheld tho, whether you where connected to the remote probe or the main hand. There are times where I had the remote in some chicken 5 feet away and the main handheld stop receiving a signal completely. I had to stop and restart it several times to reestablish the connection which was also a pain. While cooking the chicken I got a little bbq sauce on the cord, a few inches from the end of the probe, and that probe was a lost cause after that. When it was plugged in after cleaning it it read a constant 185-186 temp the entire time, it was dead. This is a waste of time and money, I bbq regularly and it was dead after 2 weeks and i sent it back."
2,remote is useless,remote is useless it gives false readings and is very hard to read if I had known more about this product I would not have bought it.
1,This dog won't hunt!,I bought my ET-7 about 4 years ago to use with my smoker. At first it worked very poorly but over time it got worse. The transmitter and the remote will not stay connected and I have to go outside to reconnect the two and then it takes 2 to 4 tries to get a connection. I've had it lose connection when the remote was as little as 4 feet from the transmitter. This unit rates as one of the worst purchases I've ever made. Buy at your own risk.
1,Junk or Bad Quality Control,"OK so after reading the mixed reviews here for this item, I figured there was more good reviews than bad ones, so I gave it a try.First off no matter what I did the unit would not sync. Yes I can read instructions. Transmitter first blah blah, no auto detection. I attempted the manual sync, again nothing.Then I though I would try the Transmitter since it reads out a display. One of the sensor probe does not change on the transmitter unit. After 30 minutes of cooking it had not changed a degree yet, still at 48. Impossible I though. I checked with my thermonitor I know that works, sure enough it was 79So have a unit that is broken in two different ways.Yes I will return it, Thanks Amazon....and attempt at another unit.However with many of the other bad reviews where it would not work out of the box, I would say Quality Control on this item is pretty bad, which is why the one star.Will update on my replacement"
2,Maverick ET-7 Remote-Check Wireless Thermometer With 2 Probes,I purchased this a few months ago and I'm now using it. The remote unit is 4 off from the probes. It isn't updating on a regular basis. I've had better for the money. If I had to do over again I'd pass it on by. I'm not impressed with its operation. If you honestly like this unit your not a very good cook then.
3,Just ok,"The unit I received will not transmit thru any solid walls, less than 35 ft away. Will not transmit across my garage and thru 1 door. Disappointed in that feature."
4,An indispensable item for cooking!,"I was initially cautious when I first purchased this product as there were several critical reviews. However, I have found nothing but great results with this thermometer. The instructions for use were very straight-forward. Setup was a breeze. I have cooked multiple pork shoulders and other various items in a smoker and found that without the advantage of thermometer like this, I might have otherwise overcooked a fine piece of meat. For the price, its well worth it. Dual probes are especially nice when checking the internal temperature of not only the meat, but also the barbecue/oven/grill that you are utilizing. Great product!!"
1,"Had to return, button didn't work. Stay away.",I usually don't write reviews but I thought I would warn people about this product. The set button didn't work right out the box on this unit. Since this made it useless I had to return it. Not well made and definitely overpriced. Stay away.
5,Maverick Dual Probe Wireless Thermometer ET-7,The product worked perfectly out of the box. Placed one probe in a block of wood (Potato works also) to monitor the cooking temp in center of cooking area at grate level and the other probe in the subject (I was doing a Boston Butt). Able to watch TV and monitor my smoking. Started the fire at 5:30 am. Put the meat on at 6:00 am and took off the pulled pork at 5:30 pm for a 30 min rest before pulling. The ET-7 worked great. I have a single probe Maverick as well and another brand but have had issue with the other brand. I will purchase another to keep at the lake.
2,Disappointed,"After doing a lot of research on a digital temp probe, I finally ordered the Maverick ET-7. After reading the directions, I attempted to use the ET-7 while cooking a pork roast on my grill.I became concerned when I inserted the probe into the roast and the temp showed 54 degrees. My quick read thermometer showed 40 degrees internal temp. I placed the meat on the grill making sure the probe did not touch any metal and started cooking. The remote sensor lost connections twice and I was only 20 ft away from the grill.After 30 minutes, the alarm went off for an internal temp of 160 degrees. The roast was nowhere near done. Quick read showed the internal temp to be near 100 degrees. Roast cooked another 45 minutes and the temp was around 165 degrees using the quick read thermometer.Sent the unit back and Amazon has already confirmed my refund is in process. Great follow-up from Amazon!"
1,Big Disappointment:(,"Bought this less than a week ago and Man, I really really wanted to like this product! I messed with it for several hours; testing the probes in boiling water along with the transmitter. The probe readings were 2-10 degrees off and would fluctuate. the transmitter would quit transmitting after several minutes and then it would only transmit to about 15ft!! WHAT A P.O.S.!!! (and i don't mean positive).I did read the reviews and decided to take the plung even if the 1 star rating was as much as the 5 star ratings!! Well, you live and learn. Those rating it a 5 probably work for the company b/c no way is it close to any rating above 1!!!On a side note, it does have some bells and whistles but what good are they if it doesn't work properly?!!! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I have a NU TEMP probe thermometer (not wireless) and it is accurate and works great!! shoulda spent my money on another nu temp product!!"
3,Not Bad but Not Great!,"The two probes measured 20 degrees different when left on the table to measure room temperature. I am sure they will replace the bad probe, but when it is new you don't expect this problem. The wireless receiver does loose contact with the main unit. Almost need line of sight to insure you are receiving."
4,Positive,Good product.Follow operating instructions closely untill familiar: If the correct unit is not turned on first the actual temperature will not read on the remote.
1,DO NOT WASTE CASH...,"This product does not stay linked from the base to the control unit. It turns off, my guess is low and slow BBQ is not understood by the unit. It is complex to operate and program... Save your money, not worth it"
2,"Works, sometimes","This unit is actually sold under different brands. The unit will at times, not receive the transmission. After about 15 months, the transmission unit just died."
4,Maverick ET-7 Thermometer 2 probes,"The product works great. I like the meat choices and temperature readings. The stand is much better the the old ready chek smoker thermometer. The remote works well so I can be in the house doing other things. I also like the fact that you can plug one of the probes directly in the silver read out hand held, just in case you do not want to deal with the remote. Overall great product"
2,wireless does not work,"The range on this is terrible. I set the remote less than 15 feat away with an open window between it and the probe. Lost connecting in a few minutes, and what is worse is there no notification that you have lost signal so if you do not constantly check it you are going to burn what you are cooking.I like the alternating display between the two probes, but with the wireless not working, I have given up using it."
1,caution,"Worked as it should the first time. The second time I tried to use it, the readout displayed 270 deg when I turned it on at room temperature. I placed it into a glass of ice water and the temperature displayed didn't change. 90 day warranty."
2,"Good idea, bad exercution",My friend gave me this one for my birthday. It's pretty handy but it always reads high... A lot of my stuff are underdone if I follow the temp readout and I have to take it at least 10 degrees higher. Kinda useless as a thermometer that way...
1,Maverick ET-7 Poor Range,"The range is terrible; less than 15 feet through a window; inside is not much better. Also, the temperature variance from inside the oven and when just pulled from the oven is about 8F.I would not recommend this product."
2,Not so great,"Probe and thermo work ok. The remote thing is useless. Doesnt maintain synch, have to constantly reset.Just buy the probe and readout. throw the remote thing away."
2,So-so product,"In concept, the product is a great idea. Dual sensors for dual meats or for two different parts of the same cut.My experience thus far, however, is that the remote sensor and the broadcast unit (to which the probes connect) is finicky at best. When it actually connects, it is great, but most of the time it isn't actually receiving information and stays stuck on a single temperature giving the impression that it is receiving. Although I was quick to recognize this problem, during the final few minutes of a cook, this could have obviously ruined the meat.I've tried replacing batteries in both units but the problem persists. Certainly unfortunate as while the receiving unit is loaded with features, when the most fundamental part won't work (actually reading temperature), it makes the entire system worthless."
4,Really nice!,"I really enjoy having the wireless option. However, I can't even get it to work 50 feet inside my house nor can my father who also got one. Otherwise, I think using it and getting it set up was a breeze. It is a little difficult to set the little black sensor box if you don't have a shelf. My father and I both use it on our Big Green Eggs and I have the shelves and he doesn't and he finds it can be a problem that the black sensor box doesn't clip. Otherwise, I highly recommend."
2,below Average,"The remote would not work when it was right next to the transmitter. The instruction say don't submerge the probe when cleaning, how are you supposed to clean it after 12 hours of apple smoke. Sitting on the counter the probe reads 105"
4,ET-7 Wireless Thermometer,Works like it should. Better keep the instructions handy. Can't do much without them.
1,Avoid this Unit Wireless range very limited...,"I guess I will chalk this up to $39.99 down the drain. I bought this because I do a lot of smoking of BBQ. I had another unit that was a single wireless probe that always worked like a champ (Maverick ET-71). Its range is good enough for me to sit in my living room (through 1-2 walls and probably about 30 feet from the smoker), but this one I can't even walk away more than 25 feet outside, and I get no signal in the house not even the closest location to the smoker going through just one wall and it being maybe 15 feet away.I am extremely dissappointed, and I might has well have just bought another one probe ET-71 and just carried around two receivers. I was extremely hopeful for this product after Maverick had made such a good product in the ET-71, but I guess I was wrong."
2,Doesn't Hold a Signal,"Am using the thing for the first time today. In three hours, the control element has dropped the signal at least ten times. Every drop requires several minutes of effort to get it to reconnect."
1,Borderline useless,"Like others have posted, I find the range very limited. I've got the receiver less that 20' from the smoker and the signal fades out in about 15 minutes. The only fix is to reinitialize and redo all the setings - even the time-of-day clock."
2,Disappointed,This device is cheap. One of my probes didn't work right out of the box. Don't misplace the directions because you need to turn the units on in a very precise manner or it doesn't work.
5,Its the best one out there for the money,With two probes and all the bells and whistles it is the best thermometer out there for the money. Only negatives ive found are the lack of a back lit lcd display and the power switch is kind of flimsy.
4,Wireless Thermometer Probe,"The time of day clock is a little quirky to program, but other functions are very intuitive. Works great."
3,No MAJOR issues...,"I bought this just over a year ago, while it was on sale. No, I don't regret it! It's great to be able to measure 2 different temps at the same time - and from a distance. Battery life seems okay to me, distance is pretty good too. BUT >>> the signal is weak, and doesn't penetrate into my house. It also drops the signal periodically, which prompts you to go over to the transmitter with the receiver, and restart both components. The Timer option on this seems to be useless, as it always drops the signal on me every couple of hours."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This would be a fantastic item - if only it would work! I followed the instructions exactly and repeatedly for set up. It works great for about 20 minutes, then it loses the remote signal from the probes even when the receiver is located 15 feet away from my smoker. The signal won't come back until I go through set up, re-entering every setting only to lose the signal again in about 20 minutes. I made certain that I haven't exceeded operating temperatures or violted any other parameters for use. This product is a dog!"
3,Remote-check ET-7 Wireless Thermometer with 2 probes,"great seller and quick delivery. item doesn't work as good as I hoped it would. I've had this same model before and it worked better. I'm not complaining,I would buy another one. thanks"
2,Not good for Rotisserie,"Purchased to keep track of the Turkey on our grill's rotisserie. Since the probes have to connect to a box that cannot be inside the grill cover, would have had to figure out a way to attach to the rotisserie mechanism. Too much work so returned."
1,Remote-check ET-7 Wireless Thermometer with 2 probes,Can't do without it in my Big Green egg. Meat is always tender and juicy. Takes a lot of leg work out of smoking meat.
4,I Like it!,I like the Maverick ET-7 Remote Thermometer. Took the advice of a review that I saw before purchasing and read the instructions before using. Used it last weekend cooking a chicken and a beef roast on the smoker grill at the same time. Went in and watched a football game. The alarm went off when the beef was done. The alarm went off about a half hour later to tell me that the chicken was done
1,Waste of Money,Sucks! You have to constantly reset it to get a signal. The temp reading on the sending unit works fine but you may as well throw the receiving unit in the garbage
1,Junk,Wireless reciever stops working at five feet away. I used the trasmitter part with the two probes attached to it cooking a Brisket. Unit started acting funny 5 hours into the smoke. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!
3,Family BBQ,I bought two off these to cook four Boston pork butts at once. Checked with Maverick first to see if running two units would interfere with each other. They said they should not if I stared then one at a time. When tried this it seemed to work but I lost the signal numerous times during the 12 hour slow BBQ and had to restart them Besides this inconvenient they seemed to do a good job with accurate temp readings.
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could,"I've had this gadget for years and couldn't live without it. I've used it on all kinds of roasts. The fact that you can take the one device with you, while the actual probe is in the meat is wonderful! I frequently smoke meat downstairs on the patio and while I am upstairs finishing dinner, I know exactly what temp the meat is downstairs. I have never had any problems with the device and would HIGHLY recommend it. Unlike, other reviewers my gadget has always stayed linked the duration of cooking time and as anyone knows, you cannot cook a prime rib in a couple of minutes, more like several hours. NEVER a problem"
2,Not good,"The product is not as good as other remote temperature probes. I also have another one which works great, I thought this would be good having the two seperate probes to cook two different meats at once. I cannot get even one probe to function correctly, after trying 4 times it just starts beeping after about 10 minutes. I have tried everything I can think of and set it differently but the same thing happens, just beeps all the time so I need to turn it off completly to get some silence. I am vey disappointed with ths product, I also bought one for a christmas gift, but I will not be giving this as a gift as I dont believe it is functioning correctly. I will keep trying and advise of the outcome, but at this stage things are not looking good, keep you all informed."
1,New thinner probes are junk!,"Not what they used to be!!!I have purchased 3 of these over the last 6 years for myself and my family. The original units I purchased had heavy duty probe wires and as long as you were careful about keeping water from getting into the probes, they lasted a long time. After 3 years of moderate use, one of my probes shorted out which is acceptable.I ordered a new unit and the new probes a WAY thinner than the old ones. These thinner probes are junk!!! One of the new probes was dead out of the box so I returned the whole package and ordered a replacement. When the replacement came in both probes worked at first but stopped working halfway through grilling a steak. Maverick needs to go back to the old probes. I only have one old probe left so when that dies, I am out of luck. I would not purchase this again until the probe issue is fixed."
1,Although it is rated to 500 degrees...,"...Mine didn't hold up to sub 300 degree temperatures. First time I used it in my smoker it went out - displaying, ""HHH"", and wouldn't work thereafter. I think it would be a good product but mine didn't work. I think the quality control is likely poor with these especially in the probe wiring. So I'm giving it one star."
3,et-7 review,thermometer system works but has some annoyances: range of transmission is quite limited(i lose the signal 20ft away); receiver will not reestablish contact with transmitter automatically once brought within range;must turn receiver on before transmitter to establish communication according to instructions.
5,Great transaction,"Received purchase in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Tried it out on my barbecue and all worked fine. Easy to install, easy to interpret, and vey accurate on temperature readings. Result, a perfect and tasty meal."
3,Wireless probe,"While this probe reads the temperature well, the instructions and operations are not the most simple. It takes a lot of relearning each time I use it. Needs a simpler operation."
1,Bogus vendor,This vendor sent the wrong (cheaper) item and would not respond to my requests for a return exchange or refund.
5,For your musical baby,"Chock full of songs and rhymes, with detailed instructions on how to use these with your under-one-year-old. If you don't read music, get the associated CD and away you go!"
1,"Re released with new audio, yes, that is bad.","In the 02 release the sound has been re-recorded or ""mastered"" or something like that. Also the credit roll track has been changed in the second movie; replaced with AISENSHI from the climactic fight scene. The result was for me an unpleasant surprise. It had been a long time since I had seen the originals and I was feeling nostalgic so I rented them. I am glad i did not jut buy them straight away. It all seems out of place and just wrong. Great covers though. If you can I strongly suggest you look for an older release."
5,Wonderful books!,"These books are spectacular, we play ""I spy"" with them and see something new every time."
3,Mom finds this book more interesting,"I bought this for my 2.5 year old to look at, but she didn't show much interest. She like the train created, but some of the objects used are not too common for this age group and she doesn't recognize them yet. Have shelved the book for now."
4,Parents like it even more than the child,"We bought this for our nephew's 4th birthday. I must say that I spent at least an hour looking through the book before I wrapped it. I thought it was really cool and couldn't get over how the closer you looked, the more you would see. Aidan liked the book but was much more interested in his sea of presents on his birthday. However, my brother tells me that after a few days, Aidan went back to this book and started looking at it with my brother. He loves it and gets excited when he can figure out what the items are."
5,Fantastic Santa Barbara Day Hikes,"I have been a Santa Barbara resident for over twenty years and my family and I have enjoyed many of the featured hikes in the book. The driving directions and hike descriptions are excellent. I highly recommend the book to anyone who is looking to enjoy the beauty of the Santa Barbara mountains.Sven Klein - Santa Barbara, CA"
2,Plasticky,"I bought this on the basis of (from what I can remember) one other product review...let me add one in the hopes of helping prospective new sink owners. Yes, it is big,can fit large pots and would likely clean up well. My issue is with the aesthetics: it looks cheap. It's plastic-looking, no shine and looks more like what you might find in a laundry room (which is exactly how we're now going to use it). If you want something prettier for your kitchen, stop by home depot (yes, I know...I wouldn't have believed it either) as they have a similar sink, acrylic as well but looks like porcelain, for $160. Go for the cast-iron at $220 if you want to splurge. By no means buy this unless you're stocking an industrial kitchen or wash room."
1,BBC reporters say this book is nonsense,I saw a show on CSPAN with some BBC reporters who have investigated the claims of this book. The BBC reporters concluded that the claims of this book are nonsense.
1,100% Pure Fiction By Sick and Utter Fools,"Read John Dean's book ""Conservatives with Conscience"". The entire behind the scenes of the book are not only disturbing but shine light on the fringe Right and what lengths they will go to re-write history. The book is purely for Nixon apologists who cannot stand that they are part of the worst corrupt party overtaken by fringe fanatics. The book is a fraud and it's lawsuit loss proves that."
1,The History of Right-Wing Obsession With Sex?,"The only thing I can say about this absurd ""Democratic call-girl theory"" is that why is it the right-wing kooks are always so sex-obsessed? Obviously something is lacking in their lives. But one thing is for sure, there is no limit to the amount of lies & spin they will generate in an attempt to cover up the ""evildoers"" in their midst; and wrap themselves up in the flag while they're doing it!"
1,Pure Tripe,"I think it's pretty well established that Nixon himself ordered the Watergate break-ins, in order to get pre-election dirt on Hugh O'Brien and the Democratic party. He had learned that Howard Hughes was giving money to the Democratic Party. Hughes, the paranoid, demented billionaire in Nevada who dropped his support of Nixon after Nixon authorized Nuclear testing in Nevada, had been an albatross on Nixon during the California governor's race, and Nixon figured he could use the same angle in his ""dirty tricks"" campaign against McGovern.So, hence the slow, painful unraveling of a Presidency. This book is an after-the-fact attack piece on one of the few men who developed a conscience and told the truth in the Watergate hearings. It is a clear attempt by the neo-cons to rewrite history and cast the ""good guy"" as the bad guy. Don't waste your money on this book. It's pure tripe.P.S. -- read John Dean's ""Conservatives Without Conscience"" to see his reaction to these allegations."
3,Additions to this book,"This book is more like a bunch of journals bound together. The authors introduce new words without previous qualifications. For example, in the chapter of binocular vision, they added spatial normalization and various other models, without telling what exactly they are! Also when I tried to find these terms in relatively basic texts I was unable to find them. Same was the case with internet.It is definitly for advanced learner. (I am doing PhD in neuroscience and still finding it very difficult)To clarify zillions of issue I have to sit with my mentor. Although she is very nice but still the discussion needs a lot of time, which is difficult for her to take out in her busy schedule.In short, this book is recommended if you are doing a specific research and want to know extremely minute details of the ideas, certainly not for a introductory or intermediate learner."
4,very thorough,"I agree with other reviewers that this is not best suited as an introductory textbook; however it seems to work fine as a source of information for the student who has already taken intro psychology. There is a lot of terminology, but everything seemed to be very well explained. We did note an error or two. Overall I think this book is great."
2,Verbose and EXTREMELY boring,I am a fourth year neuroscience major and found this book to be extremely verbose and boring. The chapters are 50 pages long at least and the author continually digresses into random tangents so you're left bored and confused at the end of each chapter. Do NOT buy it unless you want to be even more confused in your course than necessary!
5,Jazz lovers bible,Just the reference book I have needed for a long time. An exhaustive source of jazz that every true lover should have on his shelf. Buying it used also saved a lot of money & the quality is very good.
2,out of print music not reviewed.,"Ever heard of the secondary market? used shops , thrift stores, people trade music all the time, almost half of my 3000 cd collection has been obtained through these means, yet because bluenote for instance lets a jackie mclean cd go put of print, they dont review it. i just dont understand the logic. ill just stick with google, then i can have more than enough info. if you can find this at your library , check it out before you buy.what about download only jazz reissues? verve does this as of this post."
4,Time For 2 Volumes?,"Comprehensive, as far as it goes, but. The major dissapointement is that there no references to various big bands and artists that were once covered. This is not the single source guide I had hoped. AMG and The Rough Guide, when available are important adjuncts. The day is fast approachingf when an online guide would be more appropriate, if it is produced and edited by knowledgeable editors."
4,"Exhaustive Reference, Frustrating to use","This is an incredible reference, It just plain has a ton of stuff in here. It covers almost everyone in great detail and is a valuable part of my jazz library.but, the book is frustrating to use. I just hate the rating system, it needs something better. Maybe 10 stars instead or something. Nearly everything in here is either 3, 3 1/2 or 4 stars and not everything is the same. Of the many titles rated 4 stars there are radical differences between them. It's just not a very good system.that's about all I can say - it's the best thing out there that I know of but if you want a more comprehensive reference it is just not realistic to expect it all in one book. This is as much as you can get into a book pretty much. It's better to get several different ones and then you'll have a good idea."
5,"A fascinating, well-plotted mystery.","Anne Perry has done well on the bestseller lists every time her books have come out. After reading this book, I can see why. This is an incredible, breathtaking book. Hester Latterly has been accused of killing an elderly woman in her charge on a train from Edinburgh to London. Things get progressively worse for her when a private detective who is a close collegue of hers comes up with very little to prove her innocence, but a light at the end of the tunnel does eventually appear. Anne Perry brilliantly describes England and Scotland with vivid detail. She even brings the village she lives in in Scotland, Portmahomack, into it. There is a great deal of psychological detail, but keep reading. The end left me with my mouth hanging open. One of the very best historical mysteries I have read."
3,"Good, but not very believable","First, I must admit I did enjoy the book, and read it non-stop till two o'clock in the morning. You find yourself really caring for what happens to the characters. The bad point, though, is that they seem to be the only thing carrying the story forward. The author has us, delve alongside Monk, into the secrets of the Farraline family, and, frankly, there are so many of them it's ludicrous. I won't give away the plot, but you have to know that so many things end up being unearthed-it's practically one shameful secret per character-that it makes you wonder, a bit sarcastically, why they all happen in the same family, and how Monk comes to discover all of them practically within the space of a week. This is stretching belief a bit thin. On the plus side, though, it's a compelling story-but definitely not very realistic."
2,Sins of the Wolf,"Hester takes up a job as nursemaid in Edinburgh but finds herself accused of murder.This is the last in a stack of Anne Perry's that I have and having finished this, I think it might be a while before I pick up another one. A problem is that a lot of the book is devoted to Hester's predicament. Unfortunately this lacks any real suspense as the outcome is fairly obvious. The family of the murder victim, the Farralines are interesting but Perry spends too much time away from them. The revelations at the climax hint at a darker, much more interesting novel, had the book focused on them more. Pitt and Hester also prove to be rather irritating this time. The developments in their relationship are handled well but Perry's descriptions of their heightened emotional states becomes very tiresome, as Perry tends to repeat herself over and over again. So,there is a good story here but it's overwhelmed by the regular characters."
5,love william monk,"I love all of Anne Perry's writing but I particularly enjoy the books written with William Monk at the lead. The time period of her books is also a strong drawing point to me.I enjoy envisioning the places, people, time.This book is a backward look at Monk as I have been reading her more recent issues. Just love her books."
2,Not Anne Perry's best,"I've read most of the Pitt books (loved most of them) and have just started the Monk series. This was my least favorite of all Anne Perry's novels. It was compelling insofar as I had to keep reading to see the conclusion, but I figured out the villian early on in the book. And, quite honestly, as has been stated in other reviews, it really stretched the imagination to accept all the scenarios regarding the family members. And, the bickering between Monk and Hester is distracting. I'm sticking with William Monk because I love his character and, I want to see the relationship between him and Hester flourish. This series, more so than the Pitt series, I believe, is better read in order."
4,Absorbed in Victorian life,Anne Perry never dissapoints. Her attention to detail transports the reader to another time.. Monk and Hester give me troubles so real and compelling that I forget my own.If you enjoy well written period mysteries these are the finest.
1,save yourself,"So, I purchased this movie because I am a big fan of both Jensen Ackles and kitchy horror. What a mistake. The plot makes so little sense that Jensen himself said in an interview that he couldn't make heads or tails out of it. Save your money and rent it if you must see it, but trust me when I tell you that you don't."
4,Watch it a second time.,"I first watched this movie because Jensen Ackles (You might have seen him on Smallville) is in it. He and the rest of the actors do a great job acting. Also has a great settings (college and log cabin which many people can relate to). But it is a movie you have to watch a second time to really understand it. The first time I watched it I was really kind of confused but watching it again I understood more of what was happening to each character. The ending does leave you hanging with at least one question though (I just don't like it when they do that in movies, unless they are going to have a sequel)(I don't think this is a sequel kind of movie). Overall I thought it was a good movie, great actors, and it does leave you wondering."
4,devour,"I really enjoyed this movie. I have watched it several times. Enjoyed Jensen Ackles' performance, also was interesting to see him act along side his father."
2,I just like the two actors and the movie sinks!,"I only watched this movie because Jensen Ackles was in it. I got to say I like how he acts. The thing is that the story isn't very good. Suspenseful horror movies isn't my cup of tea. The other thing I liked about this movie is Shannyn Sossamon. She is so hot in this movie. I liked how this movie started out until the killing started. Then, everything changed and people were just dying left and right for no reason. The movie was just about finding the reason why people were dying. At the end of the movie, it didn't tell you the reason either. So, it lets you figure that part out yourself and you have no idea if you're right or not. I just don't like that and hate those kinds of movies. Two stars for two great actors and no star for this bad movie."
1,Confused,this movie could have been great but ended up a story that did not flow and was confusing.. only great thing about this was Jensen Ackles..
3,DEVILS FOOD,"Director David Winkler's DEVOUR is a stylish, if somewhat convoluted and muddled horror thriller. Jensen Ackens plays Jake, a young man troubled with vivid nightmares. For his birthday, his closest friend has signed him on to a web site called The Pathway, which supposedly asks you to do some rather bizarre things. Jake is dismayed when it appears murder is one of those things. Jake has an old girlfriend/friend, played seductively by Dominique Swain and he hooks up too with a lovely nurse/fortune teller named Merasol, played by the lovely Shannyn Sossamon (A KNIGHT'S TALE, THE ORDER). Veteran character actor Bill Sadler has a small role as a satanist whose wife figures into the mix.It's all pretty heady stuff with a few suspenseful scenes; however, it's failure to commit to what exactly has been going on with Jake leaves a little disappointment."
2,Let-Down,"The movie starts off well enough and has all the elements of a great movie, but somewhere in the middle all that gets lost. I've watched it ten times trying to figure out where it went wrong and how the ending makes any sense at all. I would not recommend this movie to a friend, though I will admit that I love it. It's like the train wreck you can't turn away from."
5,The coolest DVD,The reason i bought this dvd was because i like horror movies!!!! and unfortunately we dont have this title here in Brazil.But if you like this kind of movie dont think twice!!!!
2,Not much of a Horror Movie,"I basically bought this because of Jensen Ackles (am a huge fan!). I'm a horror fan as well but this movie disappointed. Although Jensen was good as usual, it's a pity the movie wasn't. It started promising enough but went downhill about half way through. Rent it instead."
2,Aren't you glad its a rental?,"Jensen Ackles stars as Jake, a confused college kid with two loser friends, and a penchant for some terrifying nightmares. When Jake's friends sign him up for an onlinecomputer game they find the game has some chilling real-life consequences- the game acts as a conduit to a satanic cult which controls its players by inducing them to perform horrific acts and then to commit suicide.I rented the film mostly because I'm a Jensen fan. The acting isn't bad but the film didn't hook me. I felt bad for Jake's too friends, never really liked Marisol (Jake's girlfriend), and found the ending to be a serious ewww moment.The finale culminates in a rather unsatisfactory way (at least for this viewer)... 2 stars. Mediocre horror made somewhat more palatable by Jensen's presence. I predict this will be one of those films, Jensen would like to forget."
2,;0(,Did not like it it was corny and I was confused maybe it's just me but did not get into it. Watched on my net flex they need to get me some better horror movies seriously
3,It was Just OK,"I bought this movie after seeing Jensen Ackles in supernatural (which was actually better) season and my baby and I got hooked, we can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD, because after watching this we wanted to know what happened afterwards as it left us at the edge of our seats.I didn't expect much because it was somewhat cheesy but still not a bad movie to watch. When I heard the mentioning of Pathfinder, I actually watched the movie Pathfinder (good movie btw) a week later of course two different movies altogether but this was just OK."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made,"Everything about this movie is awful. Nothing redeeming... The acting is terrible.. the script is complete nonsense, the directing is bland and unremarkable. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some terrible movies. This blows them all away. Usually I can laugh at movies when they're really bad, there's nothing laughable about this garbage. I wouldn't even know where to begin... No suspense at all. Sickeningly bad. Save yourself the trauma and skip it. I've also noticed that the only people who like this movie at all seem to be obsessed with the lead actor in a really scary and sad way. Avoid this like the plague."
2,D (evour) (spoiler),"Yes this was a D movie dont' waste your time on it. Its very cliche, the acting isn't very good. This is a cheap rip off of Secret Window. Its not funny, not very scary just stupid. Don't waste your time on this garbage. The cover art on the dvd is catchy it makes you want to see what the movies about, a mere marketing scheme. Please don't even rent you'll be sorry you did! Read my other reviews for better movies."
5,Good book,"I have been looking for a bible-type book for my 10-year-old grandddaughter who just got a Kindle. This book is easy to understand without sounding too juvenile. I would easily recommend it to others..and may purchase one just to have handy on my Kindle, too."
3,disappointed,"I was sent the wrong book, certainly not the book that was pictured in the ad. I was sent a different version of the same title. I was very disappointed since the book that was shown is hard to find at a good price."
4,Easy,This software made it easy to create a basic will and includes additional fillable forms related to estates. Good product to keep an electronic will and to update periodically.
1,Oh My,"The more I read the book, the more I believed in our loving Lord, Jesus Christ...People who don't will be pretty surpised when they die......so sorry."
2,Disappointing,"I very much enjoyed listening to the stories, but was disappointed in her life choice."
5,clever work,"Julia Sweeney's CD and book are both amusing and thought provoking. Although the subject matter is serious, she presents it in an amusing style that keeps you laughing and involved,I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone who is open to ideas that go beyond indoctrination,"
2,Nothing Grabbed Me,"I previously read ""Every Woman For Herself"" and really liked it, so I picked up the other Tricia Ashley novel that my library offered. This book bored me to the point where I was skipping pages and skimming paragraphs waiting for something to grab me. I liked Cass and Orla, but never warmed up to Jason - Cass's bear of a friend with a reportedly horrible temper and missing wife. Dante Chase gave me the creeps, too. Yes, yes, haunted by his past and all that but where was the appeal? I never got to the point where I understood why Cass liked him so much. The physical descripton of him was unappealing, as was his personality. A disappointment. Read ""Every Woman For Herself"" instead."
2,missing pages,"I know this was a used book, but one of the pages was missing the part that is suppose to slide out. This was not mentioned in the description."
4,A Very Fun Book for Young Toddlers,"This is one of the more interesting ""colors"" books for toddlers, made more fun by the addition of sliding panels that pull out from each page to reveal animals of the featured color. The illustrations are pleasingly bright and simple, and the sliding panels make it quite enjoyable for ""reading"" alone or with an adult. Toddlers might even learn some colors, although the primary educational experience at this age is learning what a book is and does.Unfortunately, while the sliding board book concept is very fun, it is not long-wearing. The panels bend when handled roughly, making them difficult for little hands to get them back into place, and the anchoring pages split when the panels are pulled out too hard. Still, this is wonderful for children who transitioning from the ""books are toys"" phase into a read-aloud capability."
2,There are much better books out there,"If you are looking for a book about colors, or you are interested in a book that has sliding features, there are plenty of other books out there that are MUCH better than this one. The pictures are nothing special and the quality is terrible. We got this as part of a 4-book box set, and all the books came apart rather easily. My daughter was pulling a slide when it ripped through the page and I was unable to repair it so it could work again. The pages themselves got worn fairly easily as well. Once the slides fall apart and tears the page, the book is pretty worthless. I don't recommend these books. Our local dump now has our copy."
5,Slide N Seek Colors,My 1 year old loves this book! The pages are very sturdy and the pictures are bright and colorful. The sliding pages are constructed in way that allows small fingers to operate them with ease. My daughter loves to pull the sliding pages and find the objects like the red ladybug and the black and white panda. Can't wait to try Slide N Seek Shapes!
5,I love Maggie voise,"Please,at the momet I do not have time for [1000 words]SHE IS THE BEST SINGER FROM CUBA."
5,Indiscutiblemente........La Voz.,Voces como la de esta excepcional cantante nacen cada cien a~os. Siempre recuerdo cuando en su ultimo concierto en Santiago de Cuba la trompeta capitulaba ante su prodigiosa garganta en el dificilisimo tema `How High The Moon Is.........En el CD Canto Amo y Sue~o nos ofrece una rica seleccion de temas y nos deleita con su siempre bella y unica voz.......
5,killler afro funk jazz,"""A landmark of Afro-centric jazz in the 70s - and the first album by this famous underground collective! Oneness of Juju were a Washington DC-based group that grew out of the ashes of the Juju avant jazz ensemble - formed in the culturally rich African-American community of DC in the 70s, with spiritual and political aspirations that stretched far beyond the average funky combo. This first album is a masterful blend of percussion, jazz, and a slight bit of funk - alternating vocal tracks with harder-hitting jazz instrumentals, all held together under the leadership of sax player Plunky Nakabinde. The album's one of the greatest independent soul jazz albums of the 70s - and it's filled with great tracks, such as the breakbeat classic ""African Rhythms"" and ""Liberation Dues"". Other titles include ""Kazi"", ""Funky Wood"", ""Don't Give Up"", ""Poo Too"", and ""Incognito""."" -themightyDustyGroove"
3,"Bad man , Bitter women","I was hoping this book would about living life as a hippie and about QMS. It was for about the first half, then changed to a book about a marriage gone bad. A pretty good book but I could of done without the over and over episodes of Gary cheating of Shelley. I think she wrote this book as therapy for herself. She is a talented so buy it, it's a good read."
3,Shelley: ten years with Gary the rock star,"When I bought the book, I expected to learn about Shelley's husband the rock star as well as about Shelley. I started to read the book with great expectations: I am a member of Quicksilver fan club since 1967. I would recommand ""My Husband the Rock Star: Ten Years with Quicksilver Messenger Service: A Memoir"" if you want to share the life of a rock star's wife. The title of the book referred to Quicksilver Messenger Service more than to Shelley and it should not."
3,An okay show for the series,As a whole Stardust Memory is an excellent series but these episodes on this tape are a very weak link in the series. Nothing really happens. We see double-crossing as well as strange friendships and difficult situations that no-one seems to sure of how to handle. These two epsisodes inject a lot of personal story to the series but do nothing to resolve the main plot of Gundam-0083. These are not the best episodes in the Gundam series.
3,Quick easy but limited and not precise,Product is useful and easy to use for quick/rough estimates. But it does not work well if the surface is not hard and somewhat smooth. it is also not very accurate. I measured a short space and I got a couple of inches error.
1,arrived completely faulty,"Arrived completely faulty, made some fancy laser lights and buzzing sounds then gives error no matter what surface i pointed it at.Would return but am in Singapore and used a forwarder to get this product, not sure if worth hassle to get a refund.Wouldn't buy anything from them again."
4,Electronic measuring tape,I bought this to replace another laser measuring device that I use for measuring the interiors of commercial space. I like this one better than the former device because it has multiple beams (instead of a single beam) so it seems to have better accuracy and is less sensitive around windows (glare affected the other device). The only thing I that I have to get used to is that it seems to turn off in a relatively short period of time so I go to read a distance and realize the power is off. This helps prolong the battery life and the info is saved so it's not that big of a deal.
2,Only works indoors in cleared spaces.,Does not work outdoors in strong light and long distances. Need clearing for the laser to shoot into a flat surface.
3,Worth it's Cost,It serves it purpose as a great tool or measuring device. It is worth buying this product for those who are in the construction business as an alternative to using the manual steel tape.
5,It may not be perfect but it sure beats a tape measurer!,I am delighted to own this tool. Pay attention to how you hold it and it will serve you well. It can be a bit cumbersome to hold and push the READ button so just expect to take readings several times. Great for measuring rooms.
2,can't say i am impressed with it but it works (more or less),"Need to reset every now and then, accuracy is +/- 1;2 ft. So i can not say it does not work because it does and trying to do best but i would not rely on accuracy of the tool. Also cant really use it outside on sunny day. Because it wont see reflection of the laser to calculate the distance."
1,Buyer Beware,"I cannot believe the recent rave reviews for this product. They must be plants from employees etc. Don't get fooled - this is an ULTRASONIC device and uses sound for actual measuring. The ""laser targeting"" AKA laser pointer is just a cheap gimmick to fool the unsuspecting.TRUE laser distance measuring devices measure distance with light and have 1/16"" accuracy and are very consistent. Better yet, you can pick one up for under $100.Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this obsolete technology."
5,No problems,We have been using the laser a lot lately and so far it works great. I would definately recommend it.
2,Not for all purposes,Good for basic measuring with big solid walls or structures. Not good for narrow beams or such.
2,not so good,it worked well the first 5 times i used it but after that the measurements began to read very wrong results like a 10 ft room would show up as 18 ft etc
2,"This Product Does not work...Constant ""Err"" message","This product initially worked the few times I used it . Then it gave an ""Err"" message which cannot be cleared. The instructions say that ""an 'Err' message will be displayed if the target is not a good ultrasonic reflector..."". The target that I aimed at when it WORKED and when it gave the ""Err"" message was the same. A Drywall!!I even removed the battery to see if it would re-set itself. It will not. Thus, I conclude that this product is poorly designed."
2,Worked very well ... for only 2 days!,"This is a nifty tool that has a lot of potential, and really should be able to work well even at this low price.In fact, I was able to run tests and get quite accurate and quick results. Definitely needs a hard surface as the target (i.e., not carpet or curtains), but that's easy to arrange.However, on the third day, the unit just said ""ERR"" with every measurement attempt (normally it only says this for distances under 2ft or soft targets). Replacing the battery with a couple others did not fix the problem (well... momentarily I got one good reading).Oh well. Thanks Amazon for your easy return / refund process!"
2,Anastasia/Pochohantas,"This is an older version of these movies. Since my kids had seen the Disney versions, they were disappointed with the lack of quality of the older films."
1,Another pointless budget sampler,Features tracks pulled randomly from Steve's first two albums. Mediocre sound quality. Skip this and invest in the excellent Buddha remasters ofSteve GoodmanandSomebody Else's Troubles.
5,Camelpak rocks!!,"My dad and I bought these packs to take on long jogging trips during the hot summer days when hydration can be an issue. I was skeptical of using it because I figured it would bounce around and be more of an annoyance than a help, but I was so wrong. It kept my water cool (except for the little bit that stays in the tube), had absolutely no plastic taste to it, and it didn't move around at all!!! With a water bottle, I would have to carry it in one hand or the other and stop when I needed to drink so I wouldn't dump water all over me. With this camelpak I was able to keep running while drinking from the water tube.This is an amazing design. Easy to fill, easy to use, easy to empty. GREAT BUY!!! VERY HIGHLY SUGGESTED!!!"
3,Decent for the money,"Overall this hydration pack is well built and shows Camelbak's quality, but it has a few flaws. The first is that it's SMALL. I knew 1.5L wouldn't be huge but it just seems so small compared to my larger SnoDog. I purchased this pack to fit under my ski jacket so the water doesn't freeze and I wouldn't look like a hunchback. For that it works. The second issue is that this thing really needs a shernum strap. The shoulder straps on this pack like to slide down which is pretty irritating when trying to do something active."
3,Holds less then 1.5L,"The bag is well built and allows me to drink comfortably while riding a bike. I only have one problem with it - it does not hold 1.5L as described, at least I have not managed to put more than 1.2L or so in it. Filling it up is kind of awkward too; it seem like best if done by two people - one holding the bag horizontally while the other pouring water into it and then carefully screwing the cap on. It could be just me but I would prefer if I could fill it from the top. I wanted to return the bag once I found it did not hold 1.5L as advertized, but eBags charges $5 for returns and that makes returning of this $30 item unattractive."
5,I love everything by Jane Austen!,"As the title suggests this book contains the complete novels of Jane Austen, but also the unfinished novels The Watsons and Sanditon.My favorites are Sense & Sensibility, Pride & Predjudice, Mansfield Park, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion."
5,System F comes through again,"After spending considerable time in London and living for the clubbing scene, I must say that Trance Nation 3 lived up to all of my expections. As was achieved on Trance Nation 1 & 2, Ferry Corsten grabs the essence of what is hot at the moment. Soon-to-be epic anthems of the year 2000, such as PvD's ""The Riddle (Tell Me Why)"", Sandstorms ""The Return of Nothing"", and Solar Stone's ""Seven Cities"" abound on this masterful collection. This is the CD you pop in for the long road trip or when you have the dance party in the living room. I promise that as time goes on, you will love this album more and more. It's like having a little slice of the Ministry of Sound right in your own house."
3,well....,"There's no doubt that Corsten is a musical genius as are many of the artists on this collection, and the music here shows that trance is alive and well and moving forward in new and interesting ways (the liner notes are a passionate diatribe against those fueling the trance backlash). But some of the lyrics here are godawful and render some tracks unlistenable to this fan's ear. Continental trance producers, please stick to the music or get native English speakers to sing for you!"
2,I expected better,"I felt that this mix didn't stand up to Trance Nation 2 or the Clubber's Guide to Trance. I just thought the tracks were missing something. Many of the songs have awful lyrics that detract from the beat and in many cases the songs are so short that they miss the real climaxes that are available in the longer version - for example, the Walhalla song by Gouryella sounds totally different if you listen to the original mix. And the original mix is hands down much better than the version on this CD.MOS should have done better. This wasn't worth the [money]. Wait a couple months and then download much of it off of Napster... Or buy either Trance Nation 2 or the Clubber's Guide to Trance mixed by ATB. Both are also MOS productions, and although they are slightly older, I think they both run circles around this collection."
3,Good for the price,Easy to use. Works well with a Droid. Gets some static sometimes but usually can be fixed by switching stations. Sound quality pretty good if you have phone's media volume all the way up.
3,Works Well,"Cheap for what it does.I have tried a couple of different FM transmitters most of which kinda suck. With the Monster, I get good reception inside my Hyundai Tucson.I have used this with the video Ipod and I have used it with the iTouch 3rd Gen. Both work with this transmitter.I found that I have to turn the volume very high on the mp3 player and then adjust the volume on the radio before I can hear it and then it works great.I don't have any FM interference although I do hear some crackling, but it depends on the specific quality of each mp3 files. Higher bitrate files don't have any sound degredation.Cheap. Does what it advertises."
3,eh...,"This is an okay product. I had been using a tape converter but something's wrong with my tape deck so I decided to try an fm converter. It's a little touchy getting used to. You have to find an fm station that's really fuzzy and not picking up things from other stations for it to work the best. My stereo doesn't allow me to go up one number at a time, it searches for the stronger signals in between, which means I can't really find the stations that would work the best. I have found some that work pretty well, but you can still hear a little static, especially between songs. I've seen a bunch of complaints that this product sucks for big cities. I noticed the same thing but figured out that if you put your antenna all the way down, this product works a lot better. It seems to have more issues on cloudy days, so if you live in a place that's cloudy a lot of the time, you may not be too happy with this device."
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect","This FM transmitter works pretty well, and it's nice to have the option of a full spectrum of channels to choose from to broadcast to. I use it for listening to podcasts, which are mostly spoken (i.e. talk radio). Sound quality is not as big of a deal for this purpose. For listening to music, I find the background static to be too distracting.Having used other FM transmitters, this one did not perform as well as I was hoping it would. I bought another transmitter from a smaller, lesser known company and the sound quality on that unit was actually much better. Unfortunately, it stopped working after a couple of weeks so I decided to get a higher quality model from Monster, a well known company. Overall, if you're listening to podcasts, it's great. For music, I'd try looking into other options before buying this."
5,The best FM transmitter I've used (Used 4 previously),This is the 4th FM transmitter I've used and is by far the best.My previous transmitters:Belkin TuneCast II - my 1st FM transmitter. Performance = MEHDLO TransCast Universal FM Transmitter - performs no better than the tunecast IIBelkin TuneCast Auto Universal - Excellent look and feel but performs no better than the tunecast II.*** This one generates a stronger FM transmission than my previous FM transmitters! ***E.x.: I can have the transmitter and mp3 player on my passenger car seat or cup holder and it transmits flawlessly. The same cannot be said for my other FM transmitters as I need to have them really close to the car radio to get a satisfactory signal.I'm really happy I got this because I was contemplating buying a car stereo just for the AUX input.
2,Too much background noise.,"I bought this product to replace a similar unit of different manufacture. The old unit started making noise through any radio I used, and I finally tossed it. I tried this Monster FM transmitter specifically because the reviews I read about it seemed to point to its quietness and low background noise. On the several radios I played my XM unit output on through this transmitter, all of them emitted a high pitched whine using it. I returned it for a refund. Maybe I just got the lemon out of the bunch? Other than the whine, it was very simple to use and clear to read."
1,AWFUL,I wish I had come across a review like what I am about to write before I purchased this. It is awful sound quality. It did not work at all and I tried every single station I could have used. This sucks.
4,Better then the rest.,Monster makes the only FM transmitter that seams to have enough power to work ware I live. I have tried other transmitters with no luck and have continued to stick with monster. It's not always crystal clear but it gets the job done.
1,Hmmm,"I don't know if there's something wrong with me or this product but I couldn't get it to work properly. I had to crank my radio up all the way to hear anything at all. It didn't sound in stereo either. Maybe I got a lemon, but I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,GREAT!,"This is a great product! I had no problems, no static fuzzy soundsBest of all it was for a great price, cheaper then anywhere else I looked."
5,It Works!!!!!!!!,"I read many reviews before purchasing this product. It works!!!!!!! Not one complaint what so ever. I live in Springfield Mo. and I suppose that we don't have the amount of radio stations that some of the larger metro areas have. I read very few somewhat negative reviews but they were only slight in nature as opposed to those of other FM transmitters. Most of the reviews that I read, sang praises to the quality and functionality of the Monster Radio Play 300 FM Transmitter. If you want an ecellent product at a fair price, look no further, You have just found what you are looking for!!!!!!!!!!!! Donnie H."
2,"It works, sort of...","I bought this to be able to play my Ipod shuffle through my car radio speakers. It works, but the sound quality was not good at all in my KIA Sorrento. In my husband's newer VW Jetta, the sound was not perfect but much better."
3,Not quite CD quality sound...,"Easy instructions and pretty much plug and play. Not quite CD quality sound but it was better than paying thousands of dollars to install a mp3 attachment on my Porsche Cayenne from the dealer. all and all, not a great product but a good one."
1,Died in less than a year,"I purchased the product a year ago. Eleven months into it, the strange static began. I thought that a radio frequency was the problem (the LA/OC area is quite crowded). I was wrong; it was the item about to choke/croak.The product doesn't have the quality of a CD, so if you're looking for that, play a CD. It should last more than a year and the warranty, unlike their cabling, is just one year limited.I won't purchase this again.For the person who was getting sound from just one speaker, one thing to check for any MP3 player is the cabling. One sure sign that one side of the cabling isn't in the jack all the way is that sound comes from one speaker only. It was possible that your unit was having the problem, but next round, check that first."
1,Pure junk,"This unit worked well for 3 days, then only powered up intermittently. Even when the power was on, the unit didn't transmit. When it worked, it worked fine -- fairly clear signal with minimal static. But I was very disappointed and returned it after 1 week. Maybe I got a lemon."
3,I'm not blown away,It does what it says and it's not bad looking or obtrusive. I wouldn't not recommend it. It definitely beats my old cassette adapter.
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"Biggest waste of money I have ever spent, this product didnt work from the moment I took it out of the package, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"
3,Bad reception,"Monster RadioPlay 300 is way to fuzzy, save your money and get an auxiliary connection or a better fm transmitter"
2,Not Packaged -- Disappointed,"Bought this to give as a gift. Was a little surprised to find just the unit in a ziplock bag. No instructions, no quick guide, no packing material or warranty card.Just and FYI that from this seller it looks far from ""new""Since it was already open I tried it to see if it was DOAIt does work just about as well as any other FM transmitter. Static between songs but while playing it sounds fine."
3,bleh,"I purchased this FM transmitter back in July. It WORKED fine up until last month. The red light comes on when I plug it into my car, but the screen that displays the pre-set stations doesn't. There are no visble cuts in the cord or anything. I call customer service and the girl that answered the phone was super rude. She also didn't know anything about the product. So, I emailed the returns department, and I haven't received any kind of reponse."
3,It's OK. A little disappointed.,"I had an earlier version that sounded great. It had about 8 static presets available.This one has digital presets that make the whole spectrum available and assignable to 3 buttons.However, the method to scan and assign is cumbersome.Also, the sound is not as good as it's predecessor.More difficult to use, sound quality not as good. A little disappointed."
3,Good but not great,I have bought this product to use with my Zune player. It is not bad but not great. I tried couple of other products before and sent them back. This I will keep as it works better than the rest. You will occasionally get static but it is not bad. I live in the Chicago burbs... may be that is a problem as there are many radio stations around.
2,FM transmitters just don't work well,"While this may be one of the better ones, it still didn't work with my Treo 750. The sound comes out only out of one car speaker. I had to buy an additional plug to convert the 3.5mm jack into 2.5mm."
1,Blech,"It wasn't absolutely special and a need to have at all. All these things work pretty much the same and basically they really all suck. Radio stations, sound quality coming out of your speakers, it just sucks pretty much. Just go for the gusto and spend the money to have your car (pre 2007) wired for a direct IPOD connection from your local radio/alarm/car electronics installation ladies. How yewww doinn?"
3,Not worth it.,I saw that this product had better and more reviws than the Griffin proudect but it was a wrong choice to buy it.The unit feels very cheap and looks like a cheap chines toy with those red lights.The Griffin proudect sleek look and build quality is way better.Sound is ok not amazing has problem with phone network makes ezzing sound.
2,Good when it worked,"I occasionally used and it worked for 6 months, now it gives sudden statics, tried different channels, but same problem, when I switch channels, sound quality gets better for few moments then same annoying static sound comes back. I bought this item for around 40 bucks and I think its not worth the money."
2,Nice while it lasted...,"This device worked for less than a week, then the power began phasing inexplicably and the device no longer functions."
4,Good value,Works great. Like the three station option. Sound is clear through my Jeep's speaker system. Works on my iPod and Droid.
1,junk,did not work at all. don't buy. i returned and got a discount. would not work with any station. junk
4,Good,"This is one of the better quality Transmitters I was able to find. I had one that was better but I cannot remember the brand. It was several years ago and the connection stopped working. I bought this at Best Buy originally for $60. Then i came home and saw i could get it for MUCH cheaper on Amazon and returned it to Best Buy. The quality is pretty damn good. There is still the fuzzy sound on some channels and that may have more to do with the area and the channel itself, but it seemed like my older one didn't do it as often. Overall I am really pleased with it."
3,I haven't had it for long,"I bought this because I needed an adapter with the lightening attachment which they don't seem to make. Very annoying. The fit is tight to the power outlet. It works really well in some areas and not so well in other areas. I haven't had it long so I may just need to work out some kinks. When it does work though, you would think it was the radio it is so clear. But for the long trips I got it for I haven't been able to get it to work the entire trip."
1,very poor reception,"everytime the Bass on the music went up the reception got very static. tried almost every station possible but had same result. i bought a $12 transmitter from amazon long time ago, it worked alot better than this item."
1,Maybe I got a dud but didn't work from the minute I opened it,Came in 100% static all the time on every station. Could barely tell what song I was trying to listen to. Needless to say I sent it back the day after I received it. It's too bad because I've had one of these before and it worked great for years. This one may have been a dud.
1,minnesota,I was very unhappy with this unit. I had considerable problems programming the memory to accept 3 different stations. The sound that did come through was scratchy and distorted. I also had to run the volume on my sony and the car at almost 100% just to hear it.I contacted the Factory Depot who sent me this product and they allowed me to return it for a refund. They were very courtious and helpfull. With them I give a 5 STAR rating and would buy different products from them.
1,Strong signal BUT cuts off High Freqs ! Get iRiver instead!,"It cuts off High frequency range almost completely. I had iRiver FM transmitter for a couple of years until it broke, so i tried this Monster and must say that the transmitting signal is a lot stronger than iRiver and the bass is nice, but ALL, not kidding - all of the treble is gone! the sound is flat! I thought i can live with it at first but then it's so annoying - it is going back where I bought it. And I am placing an order for the iRiver Transmitter. Whoof."
3,"great transmitter, but not for a cell phone","I purchased this product to use with my cell phone mp3 player in my car, it sounded aweful, apparently the cell phone also transmits some fm, long and short of it is that this product works great for normal mp3 players (I had one for my sony walkman), but doesn't do so well for cell phone mp3 players, I ended up putting an fm modulator in my car to use my cell phone mp3 player."
1,MONSTER RADIOPLAY DOES NOT WORK!,"I ordered the Monster RadioPlay 300 from CrazyOnDigital. They shipped to me a Monster RadioPlay 250. When I attempted to contact CrazyOnDigital, they failed to answer my inquiries. This product requires you to constantly change the station to play your IPOD anywhere while driving. This creates a driving hazard and is very inconvenient. Stated simply it does not work. Save yourself some money and a great deal of frustration. Do not purchase this inferior product and do not buyany merchandise from CrazyOnDigital! They do not provide any customer service and they do not fulfill their orders with the correct merchandise originally ordered."
5,An economical solution for car audio peripherals,"This item is an excellent solution for those who want to use alternative audio input sources but do not have an auxiliary input jack on their receiver. (i.e. - ipod, mp3 player, laptop, etc...) I have a well balanced, high powered car stereo purchased in 2003 before the auxiliary input was as common as it is now. The fm transmitter provides sound quality comparable to a finely tuned radio station and I have not heard any outside interference. I am very happy with the purchase since replacing the kind of deck I have with one that allows auxiliary input would be around $400.00."
2,"Does what it's supposed to, but quality is iffy","Had one of these for a little over a year before the male 3.5mm plug started showing signs of a loose connection... and that was pretty much the end of that. After a few trips getting distracted jiggling the confounded wire to get the connection reestablished I gave up and threw the thing out. Not really the value for money I had hoped for, but unless you end up with a lemon like mine, it's a very decent product that does what it claims to do."
1,Horrible reception,"Reception in the car radio from this Monster cable was horrible. One station presets were better the others, but it was not worth the $20. Had to keep it still (kinda hard while driving) so there would be *less static than usual. Wouldn't buy again."
4,Very good value,"This Monster product performs quite well and taking the time to find the 'right' empty airspace makes all the difference, please note that some tracks play extremely well, but others come across scratchy and a bit fuzzy. I am quite happy with the product, my only real wish is that it would be nice to have an 'on/off' switch."
3,Not TOO bad..,"If you can avoid this method of listening to your music in the car, by all means do so. The tape-deck adapter works SO much better than this, and the only reason I don't use that is because my tape-deck does not work. At first I was pretty happy with this adapter, but its already begun to deteriorate and causing static in my audio. I will most likely have to replace it very soon, and I will be going with a different brand. Even brand new holding it in your hand it feels light, the buttons jiggle, and it feels cheaply made; and it is not cheaply priced."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY.,"I read reviews on various gadgets of this type, and purchased this because of the reviews of this product on Amazon.This is the best of any that I've used or heard about. A must in older vehicles, which don't have the insert to connect your MP3 directly. Price was great, especially compared to a Radio Shack version, which was much bulkier & twice the price."
2,Bearable but annoying.,"I bought this transmitter so that I could play audio from any device I'd like to while in my car, mostly music off of my Droid Razr. In buying the Monster brand I was expecting a solid product, but I haven't been fully satisfied. I am able to get decent, though often static laced sound most of the time I use it. Other times I have trouble finding an unobstructed radio station to transmit through and the device is useless. I would try other options before settling on this product."
1,stopped working early,"not recommended, expensive, works same as other cheap ones, and stopped working early dont buy a a a a a"
3,Works but prone to inteference,"Three stars means this works with some satisfaction. However, it is prone to interference causing static or choppy or lost signal while driving. I would recommend installing a 3.5 audio plug or bluetooth, if you have the dosh."
3,The lesser evil,"This is the BEST product of it's kind. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. Unless you have a tape deck in your care or you're willing to drop about 4 bills, an FM transmitter is the only universal tool for hooking up your mp3 player to your car stereo.We live in DC, and considering that the radio waves are pretty crowded here, the transmitter works very well. There is some fuzziness between songs, but we have found a few stations that offer mostly good quality sound. It is essential if you live in a metro area to purchase a transmitter that allows you to use any station.However, in order to change stations you must first save it as a preset station and then move to that station. You can't just push an up or down button and stop on a station you want to use, you must first save it. This can be annoying and almost impossible if you are driving.Despite all this, I would recommend this product specifically for anyone looking for an FM transmitter. Trust me, this is my third one!"
2,Static,"I figured this product would be good considering monster is a solid company, however, every station that I was able to hear my music (Zune), there was static, even subtle static was enough to make it not worth the money. I got a cheaper Belkin product and it was much better, I found at least one station that gives basically no static. So just get that instead of this for 1/3rd the price. I live near a major city and that may have caused some of the static, but the Belkin gets me almost none so it must be the product."
4,Fair Alternative,"Works to get the music from MP3 player to vehicle reciever/sound system. Not the cleanest way to listen, but without an auxillary input to the vehicle system, the FM transmitter works well enough. Has made letting go of satalite radio much easier! Overall, seems to work pretty well."
2,Not good for the price,I bought this product about 4 months ago. It died. I don't know what happened. I just went to plug it in one day a couple weeks ago and it wouldn't even light up. I also feel that the other comments were a little misleading...it only has 3 stations that it can use and if you live near the city it's not a great idea. I live in Charlotte and it's a pain. It's easy to use but I wouldn't recommend it. I usually had to try all the stations every time I would travel an hour to three hours away.
1,Don't waste your money buying this one,I didn't have a nice time using this product. Noisy and cable may get loose over time. Not worth it for the price.
5,No complaints here,"I was searching for a new cassette adapter to use a cd player in my van, assuming there were no other options out there. But I discovered that I could plug this into my van and MP3 player and it's even better! The reception and presets have been fine for my area and even when I traveled up through New England. So easy to use, in fact I don't even need to do anything but plug it in when I want it. I have used it with a generic USB drive MP3 player, nothing fancy about it, and it still works great!"
3,"Good Quality, needs an auto scan","This is a great device, seems to give me clear and good audio quality, has three station presets, and a dimmer. The one glaring omission is that this does not have an auto scan feature to find a clear or unused channel..."
5,This one works! I have tried others and have been disappointed!,"I really love my Monster 300. I have tried 3 other fm trasmitters and none were acceptable. My brother has the Monster RadioPlay 300 also, he loves it also. So I just finally bought one and glad I did."
4,Finally!,"Finally - an FM transmitter that works. It's not going to replace a wired connection, but I've had no problems keeping a signal on it from my way to and from work. I've had problems with an analog transmitter but this one is locked into the station you set it at. I'm very satisfied."
2,Personally I'm a little dissapointed...,"Unfortunately this item doesn't provide flawless quality through the radio. I can't seem to find a station that doesn't have any static. Not to mention, it's awkward to use. Unfortunately I stopped using this product after a week, and went back to burning CD's.Save up your money and buy a head-unit that has an auxillary input jack."
3,Good FM Transmitter,"This works well. I have a few negatives (but wouldn't send it back). The instructions, for me, were hard to follow. The channel buttons are too close to the ipod for when I shake it to shuffle the songs, it often gets bumped and changes the channel."
3,Acceptable if you're strapped for cash,"This is a pretty good product if you are strapped for cash to add an iPod jack to your car. This is the second of its kind I've purchased for my car since I didn't want to spend the money to get a jack installed.If you have an older car this is fine. If you have a newer car with a decent sound, it kind of will sound like if you play an iPod with cheap headphones compared to Skull Candy. Everything sounds pretty flat....and you can't do anything about it. Has minimal interference however. I ended up returning it and bought and installed an iPod jack myself for about $90 including shipping and everything."
3,It work... Sorta,"Product arrived later than expected, product was poorly packaged (makes me question the ""NEW"" status). But it does work to a degree, maybe if i moved to a smaller town it would work better. I think there are too many radio stations where I am but it does work in the sence that it turns on an performs a function, static or music depends on how over run your local air waves are. Not giving a 5 star rating because it doesn't work very well but it does work!"
3,It does the job,"The Monster RadioPlay 300 links my vintage mp3 player to my vintage car stereo adequately.The controls, though manageable, are not quite intuitive. The link is not always crystal clear as I would have hoped due to radio/atmospheric interference, but all in all it's a good little unit. The only difficulty is when your chosen FM frequency is interfered with and you need to select a new one while trying to drive.A simpler user interface would make that less problematic."
3,it's OK,"Sound quality is good (never had any interference except at the end - had to replace it).Mine started acting weird one year after I bought, the sound wasn't as good and it seemed like I was always in a tunnel with bad reception. Bought a new one which works fine.They are just not made to last that long I guess, but for the price I would say it's good value. I used it everyday for 12 months!"
4,Best transmitter I've found,"We have tried several of these transmitters and this one has worked the best for us. We connect either our mp3 player or smart phone to play music in the car. The signal is clear and we don't have to keep changing it to another station, it stays strong. The only problem that we've encountered is that the wire breaks easily inside near the thicker black part where it goes into the silver part. This renders it unuseable. You need to take caution in moving it around a lot flexing the wire. Other than that an excellent product."
2,Not impressed,"Ordered this to replace a Griffin transmitter that I have had for years. This one pales in comparison. While I understand that all transmitters have some static when listening through them, this one is worse than I expected. Not only do you have to deal with the poor signal, the volume level of this one is also very poor. There are several songs on my ipod that I literally have to turn up the volume on both the ipod and the radio to even hear. Would not recommend. My Griffin transmitter is falling apart and I still have better sound using it. I guess I'll use it until it quits completely and then try again."
1,HORRIBLE- static and broke within 1 week.,"Save your money, this product isn't worth the clamshell packaging it comes in. Hard to navigate stations, AWFUL static audio quality, and the bezel covering the digital display on the front broke off within 7 days. I threw it away and bought a different brand, yes, IT'S THAT BAD."
1,Static!,You can barely hear the music over the static. Thought it might just be our car so we tried a couple friends' cars and it was the same. Total waste of money.
3,It works,"The transmitter works quite well. The sound comes in clear. The volume is quite low, though; but then again, this is the first FM Transmitter that I've ever bought so I don't really know if that's how FM transmitters work or if I just really need to crank up the volume on my player.The interface is great. The lighting makes it easier to use this device at night. Having three preset stations is very convenient.I think this product is quite good. The best thing about this product is that it's not expensive and it works!"
5,A great product - worth every penny and more,"I bought a useless chinese product from meritline and wasted money. Was hesitant but eventaully bought this product just because of all the reviews. Honestly just read all the reviews and they are good, exactly to the point. Honestly i found my product better than the reviews. I wanted a good, easy to use product with good sound transmission. And offcourse i bought it from eforcity with whom i had good experience. I hate to contact the retailer so its the reliability i want combined with one of the lowest prices out there."
2,didn't work so well for me,"I wanted to listen to podcasts on ipod classic. I read reviews before ordering and was hoping to be one of those that found it worked well. Didn't happen for me. There was too much interference once I neared the city and audio became bad -- too much static, like a weak radio station. Since that is my regular commute and the reason for the purchase, using this product just doesn't perform well for me. I've reverted to making cd's if there's something I want to listen to on the drive. It's a pain but the audio is clear, which is important when listening to spoken word."
4,"works as it should, but isn't perfect.","I use this Monster with my ZEN Mozaic. Works generally well, although during longer trips I have to switch stations often. I guess that's not the transmitter's fault. It is a bit difficult to do while driving! Otherwise sound is great!"
4,Very good once you get it set up.,"Setup is tricky... instructions are not very clear. Easy to ""bump"" it and change the frequency setting. Otherwise, it seems to work better than any of the others we have tried and I'd recommend it."
2,Worked great for half a year,"The transmitter has worked well for me, and the quality has been fine, but recently (after owning it for maybe half a year) the audio connector became very finicky. It had to be twisted to a certain angle to receive my mp3 player's audio, and would cut in and out (or not play at all) if jiggled or rotated. (I tried an adapter to see if it was my mp3 player being stubborn, but I can confirm it is the Monster cable that is not working). It is now so unusable I decided to throw it away.Otherwise, for when it worked, I had no complaints about it!"
2,Didn't work in my 2003 Carolla,"I purchased this item based on the generally positive reviews off Amazon, but found that it didn't work very well at all in my 2003 Carolla. I tried quite a few different station settings - including ones well away from real FM stations to get away from any possible interference. I could never get a setting that produced a decent sound quality.I also tried this in our 2005 Sienna thinking the results might be different - no luck.I tried different devices, including my smartphone (Droid Eris) and an iPod Shuffle.Amazon processed the return perfectly, even though I no longer had the original packaging."
2,FAILED EARLY,This transmitter worked better than it's Belkin predecessor but failed were the cord goes into the selector after only a year use. Needs better strain relief at that point.
4,"Works great, strong signal",I have a little experience when it comes to FM transmitters and I have noticed that a lot of them have such a weak broadcast signal that I usually have to have the device in the back seat just to hear the music (my antenna is in the back of the car). This device works great anywhere in the car and I don't have to crank the volume up to hear the tunes. Very happy with my purchase.
4,g2g,plugged it in and it worked like a charm but the sound was little low but i turned it up all the way in my car and it made up for it being low on low haha. really love it ****
1,Horrible product,"Horrible product!! Waste of money, do not even waste ur time! I live in an area with numerous dead channels with other older transmitters working perfectly well ... This one is all static and a complete failure."
2,Good sound quality and signal strength... for the 6 months it worked.,"I bought this fm transmitter about 6 months ago and was fairly satisfied. It was a little more expensive than I thought it should be for the basic features it has, but I decided to give it a chance. The sound quality wasn't excellent but was well above what you would get from a cheap device, and the signal strength was really good. From what I've written one would think it would be a 4 star device, and it would be have been had it not shorted out 6 months after I bought it.I take care of my electronics so I know it wasn't excessive force or abuse that did it in. Now whenever I try to use it if the move the cable even the slightest bit the left speaker cuts out, very frustrating."
2,piece of junk,"I bought this really cheap a year or so ago, and I guess I got what I paid for. The little part where you press the buttons to choose the station is super sensitive. Barely touch it and it switches to another station. It frequently slides down between my seat and the center console, where I have to fish it out and the station gets changed again. Sometimes there seems to be static on several stations that I go through. The display also gets super hot, even if you have the light turned down. When I can afford to buy a better transmitter (hopefully one that also charges), this one is going in the garbage."
1,"Potentially good, but terrible sound quality","For some odd reason, the sound quality for the first two times I used it was comparable with the old Belkin device, but since then it has constant static and sounds terrible. Very disappointed and back to my old transmitter I guess."
4,It works!,"I tried a ""no name"" FM transmitter I got off ebay. It cradled my iPhone and was even supposed to charge it. It worked for about 3 minutes(even that 3 minutes was full of static..). The Monster 300 has been working great for me for about a month now! I've noticed if I put my phone on the console or passenger seat it picks up a little static. If I put it in my lap it's clear! Give this one a try. It's worth the money."
1,Will be returning,"This device only worked for about 20 minutes, after which I could not get a sound from it on any frequency. Would NOT reccomend."
2,Stay away from the cheapest price.,"I received a model, not as pictured. The vendor offered me a refund, but after shipping both ways, it's not the wisest decision. I was better off just keeping it.The sound over the FM was heavy in bass and not enough treble. The model I received was not the Full Spectrum, but instead, the model that offers just a few frequencies. I am not happy with this product, but in all fairness, the Monster RaidoPlay I received was a different model than the one I ordered. I will attempt to purchase and try from a local retailer soon."
2,Sold by morons and only works out of ONE speaker,"First of all, they sent me the wrong model. Second, while it sounded great, it only produced sound out of ONE speaker. I know it wasn't my car stereo or MP3 player, because they work fine with everything else. I asked to exchange the item. I had to pay to ship it back even though it was obviously defective and then, though I sent it to ""EXCHANGES"" and was told it would be exchanged, it wasn't. It was refunded and they told me to reorder another one. Thanks...but, I'll try a different brand. What a bunch of morons! Can't even get the right item in the package, charge $10 to ship something that weight about 2 ounces, and they don't understand what ""exchange"" means. Sad."
1,Monster RaidoPlay 300,Disapointed that this product doesn't charge I-Pod. As a result I have had to return this product to exchange for another one. I still haven't heard from them for my refund it has been over two weeks!
2,Disappointed,"I just got done playing with this in my car for the last hour. I don't know if it's my location (about 90 minutes north of NYC) or what, but, I just could not find a station that provided sound that satisfied me.The best sound I could get was equivelent to a average to poor radio station. Sound was distant and hollow. Not anywhere near a quality radio station sound.Let's put it this way, if I were to tune to a radio station that had the sound I was getting, it might hold my attention for a little while, but, certainly not a station I'd be willing to preset on my radio.This is being returned."
2,works but....,"for as much as it costs, its a piece of junk. Most FM transmitters are, i heard some good things about this one, so i thought it would be better, and it wasnt =(, and i dont even live in the city, it has alot of static, and garbled, underwater"
1,Couldn't pick up the FM signal in Los Angeles,"I have a 1999 Toyota Tacoma pickup. I bought the Monster FM transmitter to work with my iPod. But I could not tune the device to any station so that my stereo and antenna could pick it up. I got a faint signal at 88.9, but then that disappeared. It could be that the Los Angeles area airwaves are just too crowded. I am getting a cassette tape to MP3 converter next. Hopefully, the hard line will work better."
4,Best FM Transmitter So Far,"I've used a handful of different transmitters for my iPod from Belkin to Griffin, but the Monster had the best sound quality out of all of them. Signal is so strong that I rarely experience interference, and I don't even have to have my iPod's volume setting at maximum. With other transmitters, I usually have to turn up my car stereo volume high to hear my iPod and when I turn off my iPod, the radio comes on blasting. Not with the Monster.I do miss my previous transmitter, the Griffin iTrip Auto Universal, because it had the USB port that I can charge with. I'd give the Monster a perfect 5 star if it had that same feature.I should mention I can only use transmitters that connect to the iPod using the standard 3.5mm audio jack because my iPod's bottom dock is slightly broken in that it does not transmit audio."
2,Broke after only a few weeks.,"The 3.5mm cable broke after about 3 weeks of use. I had to cut open the cable and re-splice it, that worked for another few weeks until it stopped working completely.I am very disappointed in this product."
1,Fails After 30-40 Minutes of Use,"This unit at first pleased me with adequate audio quality and the ability to bypass those unreliable tape cassette adapters which only work in some cassette players. However, after about 30-40 minutes of playback, this unit fails and displays a flashing ""J"" in the display. If I let it sit for a while, it works again for another 30-40 minutes and then fails again. This failure is both repeatable and seen with a couple of different audio sources. I contacted Monster support via their website's email form, but there was no response. I guess most people use it less than 30-40 minutes and therefore do not see this issue."
1,Sound quality terrible!,Dont purchase this product as the sound is not good. Slightest movement of power cord creates severe static.
2,Not the quality I expected,"I am not happy with this item. It will not hold the station and has a lot of static. Therefore, music does not play correctly.Very disappointed."
5,Happy daughter,"She wanted her first used ,new to her vehicle to have outlet for I pod did not so bought this plug and she found it to be very simple and of good quality especially for price and stays tuned in sounds great!"
1,"Very poor make, build quality","Had a terrible experience with this item. Very flimsy buttons, poor build quality and make. Stopped working in a few days. There are better choices out there."
4,I liked it so much I bought 3,"For the price and the flexibility this is a great FM transmitter. I has worked for every MP3 player and Phone that I have attached it to. It has the usual problem of finding a clear channel in a large urban area, but with a little fine tuning with the Monster and the player I have had minimal interference."
2,Nearly useless,"I've now used this on two long car trips up and down the East Coast, and my recommendation is that you only buy this if you are absolutely desperate to use your iPod in your car, and there are literally no alternative ways to use your car's audio equipment to accomplish that. The sound (whether in an urban area or way out in the sticks) is noisy, distorted, and compressed, even when there are no local interfering stations. Loud music is crackly, quiet music is inaudible."
2,"Poor sound quality, weak transmitter","I was hoping to use this to play my ipod in the car on road trips. The sound quality is terrible, and there is static on just about every channel. I live directly between Milwaukee and Chicago, so there are very few stations that have dead air. This transmitter is not strong enough to block all of the interference from local radio stations. This product may work well when traveling through rural areas, but that has yet to be tested. Do not purchase this unit if you live in an area with tons of radio stations."
4,Good product.,"I love that this will work with my iPod, iPad, or cell phone. It is also really easy to use. The only thing right now that I dislike is it only allows you to use 3 of their pre set stations. Only one of them works where I live. I used to have an older version of this but after many many years, it broke. It had 6 pre set stations on it and it plugged into my iPod.Overall, I like it. I would recommend this to someone else."
1,UNHAPPY,I got this transmitter today in the mail ahead of time and thats about the only positive thing ive got to say about it. One of the digital numbers were out and didnt work so i didnt know what station it was on exactly. The other complaint i have is that it is junk. No stations worked at all. It is a poorly made product. I will be sending it back..
3,Ehh,It gets the job done but it doesn't send out a strong enough signal to totally kill any station you try to play it on.
1,"Didn't work at all, returned",I could not get a single station to play acceptably. Returned this item after trying to go through every station without any positive results.
4,Will Not Work With Iphone,"This is a great FM Transmitter, but it will not work with the iphone. Even with an adapter. Something to do with a floating ground."
4,music lover,"The CD player in my car as malfunctioned. So I was thriller to find out I could play music from my MP3 player over my car speakers. Although the sound quality is not as good as that from a CD, it is still quite enjoyable. This transmitter gives you a lot of station choices. This is a significant advantage. Since most stations seem to broadcast in my area, it would have been difficult to find a setting that would work if I had chosen another transmitter brand with fewer station choices."
3,good for the price,"this transmitter works rather well, just haven't figured out how to change the pre-programmed stations, the only thing I do not like is it does not have a USB charger in the AC adapter to charge your player as you listen. Other than that, good product"
1,"Very Poor Reception, Lots of Static!!","I was not very pleased with this product. It does offer a large list of stations to choose from, but none of them were clear at all. I'm not talking a little static (that's to be expected) I mean, you couldn't hear the music over the static noise."
1,Weak.,"This product is so inferior I almost can't believe I paid money for it. Even the slightest amount of volume in a song makes the sound dissolve into static. Trust me, I've tried every frequency, they are all garbage. The last Monster FM transmitter I had was marginally better but alas, it died. The only reason I use this is because my nearly inaudible iPod playlist is better than anything the Clear Channel has to offer and it's illegal in Massachusetts to listen to your headphones while driving."
1,Stopped working within six months! Not recommended!!,"Ordered it for my Droid Razr in December, 2011. Worked fine for six months, then gave in. The cable/wire has problems and it won't transmit the music to the speakers, I have to constantly tinker with the wire to transmit the sound, which is impossible(and unsafe) to do while driving and kind of defeats the whole purpose. For a $25 transmitter, this was disappointing. I had a $5 FM transmitter before (when I had an iPhone) and it worked fine without any trouble for ages.Not recommended!"
4,Monster Transmitter,The product was received in a timely manner. Service from the seller was good. The transmitter arrived just prior to a long road trip so I was able to give it a good testing with my Sony MP3 player in my 2004 Dodge Durango. Easy to install and use. Found some cases where the FM station used eventually over rode the signal for the MP3 player. This was temporary and changing the corresponding station fixed it for awhile. Overall a good value for the price and does the job.
3,Monster 300 review,"Product works ok, but hard to find a station that is not near any others as there is some interference from nearby stations. Also it is hard to find a position on the dash or console to set the device with good reception. Would be more helpful with a longer cord so the device could be positioned better.Couldn't find anything that was rated higher without spending a lot of cash (>$50)."
1,Unclear; not worth the money,"I bought this product before a long road trip. I connected it to my iPod to play MP3's along the way. The sound quality is horrible! The static was either hissing in the background or overpowering. I never found a frequency that did not have static. Also, the music sounded like it was being played in a cavern through the wall. It was muted and echoing. I returned it as soon as I got back from my trip. Not worth the money."
1,doesn't work,I bought this transmitter and it doesn't work. I contacted the company that sent it and they told me I had 30 days to send it back from the time I ordered it. It took the company 14 days to send it and it was a gift for my husbands birthday so my time is up. I am very unhappy. I am trying to get them to make an acception in my case. We shall see.
5,Amazing Writter on Finances,I like the practical way Dave deals with people and finances. A real life way to do your finances. Book was in great shape and the shipping was right on time. Great people to buy from. Thanks Vickie
3,Too basic,I guess this was a little to basic for me. I feel like I had a handle on most of the things in this book. Still a big Dave Ramsey fan though.
2,"Long on imagery, short on plot","The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness is actually three novellas in one book. The first is a somewhat interesting tale that has some suspense combined with Bass' always vivid imagery of the arctic wilds. I found the second story to be a confusing jumble of characters mixed with cumbersome metaphors concerning oil wells and mortality. The third is somewhat better in that it has beautiful imagery and a gentle, simple storyline. The only drawback is that almost absolutely nothing of interest occurs in the whole story. For those readers looking for a work of art translated into words, The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness will satisfy. If, however, you read a book to see something happen, you will probably be disappointed by this one."
2,NOT A HIGH RATING HERE!!,"THIS IS MY THIRD RICK BASS BOOK---""""NINEMILE WOLVES""""WAS BY FAR THE BEST. THESE THREE STORIES / NOVELLASBORDERED ON THE BBBEEEEEEEZZZAAAARRRR. HIS WRITINGFORM IS VERY GOOD---ENJOYABLE---HE CAN STRING HIS WORDSTOGETHER NICELY. BUT--THE ACTUAL STORIES---????.EXAMPLE---THE YOUNG GIRL & HER YOUNGER BROTHER RUNNINGTHRU THE TEXAS BACKWOODS, BAREFOOT, LATE AT NIGHT, ONAN ADVENTURE---????---WHERE ARE THE SNAKES?? DID THEYALL DISAPPEAR?? NOT VERY REAL I WOULD SAY."
3,Works Well For Now,I am 35 years old and have been suffering from acne since I turned an adult. I've been using this product for 3 days and I see improvements I never got with Proactive or from my dermatologist. The irritating bumps and whiteheads are disappearing but I must say that the step 3 lotion can irritate and burn all day. Do Not get it anywhere near your lips or eyelids!I'm going to continue with it. I long for the day when my skin is clear and I don't have to wear make-up to 'hide' flaws and black marks over my face. I pray this works for me in the long run
2,Worked pretty well but too harsh,"I used the original acnefree and felt I needed something a little stronger. As soon as I started using acnefree severe I started seeing results, however after about a week of using it my skin began burning and having dry spots. My skin usually tolerates acne treatments pretty well, but step 3 the day time lotion was just too harsh."
5,excellent product,AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment is the best product on the market. I have never had a acne treatment work so well for me.
4,It really worked for me,"I've tried several products in the past and this one seemed to worked the best to help clear up my very mild blemishes around my nose and does it pretty quickly. I barely been using it a week. I actually liked the morning lotion which does burn a little and feels somewhat sandy when applied, but it's better than the oily feel I get with other products.Also, you're better off finding this at Walmart where I got mine for less."
4,Great Product,"This product is fantastic. I was completely clear of acne in one month. I live in the carribean and ordered it front amazon.com. I've tried Accutane, Proactiv (twice), prescription drug, antibiotics etc. But nothing worked as quickly and completely as Acnefree. Thanks! Wish I had a before and after picture. Just need to get rid of the acne scars, can't use hydroquinione so I'm at a lost. But the acne is gone. Yeah!!"
1,Does. Not. Work.,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I went out to Target and bought this product. It's been two months now, and my skin has not improved at all. I'm still breaking out, and even more of my face is covered with acne!"
1,HORRIBLE - HORRIBLE - HORRIBLE,"This was by far the worse acne treatment system. I followed the directions absolutely correcly but it just made my face worse and some days dry and other days greasy. Don't waste your time, money, or looks... go with something else."
2,"Works, but not for long.","This product works great in the first few weeks.It got rid of all my acne.Although my face burned, hurt, very dried out, flakey, red..And after about a month, It no longer works, my acne is getting worse than its ever been in my life.If you want quick results for something i would try this product, but if you want long term results, this is not for you."
2,good for leather faces,"My acne has been halted, but my face looks worse than it did before the treatment. Your face will feel like it is on fire!!! I now break out in places where I have never had acne. Very stringent process everyday!"
2,not sure about this one,So Ive been using this for about three weeks and I havent really seen a change in my face. I have bad acne that comes and goes and when I got this in at the time my face was pretty bad broken out. Though I havent gotten any new brakeouts the ones I already had really havent gotten much better. Im still using it hoping that it might take a few weeks for it to really kick in but I really dont have a whole like ot faith in it now. Oh and whatever you do dont get it near your eyes. I got it just under my eyes and that part of my face was on fire for two days!
1,makes it worse!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm using it for 4 days and my acne is getting worse.I read the reviews before ordering them,I don't know what these people are talking about but I definitely do not recommend this to anyone ."
1,Caused severe chemical burn!!!,"My daughter used this product for about three days. Yesterday she started with a rash which then turned into a really bad chemical burn on most of her face! It didn't really help the acne, her skin looked way better before using this. Now not only does she have the burn, but also patches of dry white flaky skin that will not go away! I guess if you want to burn a layer of your skin off, this is the product to use. Be very very careful if you use this! Her face is a hot mess. The burn is very red, rashy, and really painful."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I orignially used Pro-Active. I am 39 and NEVER got pimples as a teen. I tried pro-active and it worked great. I found AcneFree and it said it worked better and faster than Pro-Active and was less expensive. I tried it and my clear skin (from using Pro-Active) broke out in pimples. To be fair, I tried it for a month. My face never got better. I went back to Pro-Active, gave AcneFree to a friend for her son to use and it didn't work on him either.Once again my skin is clear. Pro-Active may cost more, but it is much more effective on my skin.I am not saying that this won't work for you, but it DEFINATELY did not work for me or my friend's 15 year old son....."
4,Best product I have tried!,"This is a fantastic product. I have tried everything and this is the only system that has given me results. The clearing doesn't happen overnight, but it can significantly help your skin in the first couple of weeks. THe only negative comment I have is that the products can sometimes bleach clothes and pillowcases."
2,worked so-so,"I bought this product for the first time ever and it worked great - my pimples were clearing up and my skin was really soft, so I didn't think that there woulb be a problem purchasing a second shipment. WRONG!!! For some reasin, the second time around, my face got really dry, to the point of itchiness and I was scratching it like crazy!!!Not sure if the items were expired, but I don't think that i'll be buyinfg this product again - lack of consistemncy :("
4,Clearing up most of the acne....,"I am almost on my 3rd week of using this product, it has greatly improved some of the areas on my face. I'll continue to use it and hopefully it'll take care of the rest."
5,Only used the spot treatment,So I haven't used the entire system but the spot treatment is amazing! It only took one night to reduce my giant pimple. It's not harsh and is pretty cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a fast problem solver.
1,More acne after using this product,"I recently bought this product online. I used to get one pimple at a time. Hence I thought I need to use a complete system to cleanse, tone and treat my skin. after using this product my chin and cheeks are full of acne. I don't know where I went wrong. My skin was super itchy and dry in the first two weeks. I accidently applied it around my eyes and next morning my eyelids were swollen up. My skin feels like its burning when I apply this product. If it cleard my acne I would continue to apply the product to the affected areas. but instead I have more acne. So I just bought a local brand acne cream which has 10% benzoyl peroxide."
1,Didn't work and can't get money back,"I bought this after reading some reviews and liking the price. But it was a waste of money and didn't make any positive difference for my daughter. It actually dried out her face and almost ""burned"" it. She has switched to ProActive and loves it. I was optimistic it would work, but am disappointed. I wish I could return it and get a refund, but Amazon says no."
2,My daughter has allergic reaction to it,"I bought this for my daughter. She tried the cleanser before and it is working fine so I bought the whole system. However, she got allergic reaction and has to stop."
1,Buy Proactive!!!! Not this!!!!,"I bought this instead of Proactive, which I have used in the past with good results. While Proactive dried my skin out, it did nothing like this product. I still have just as many breakouts, but now my skin is also dry, peeling and itchy. It also has made my skin red and blotchy. Plus there is No money back garuntee. BAD product, go for Proactive instead."
1,Didn't work for me.,I have tried about 100 different products (including this one) to treat my acne...as well as going to 3 different dermatologists and nothing worked. I FINALLY found a product that has worked for me and I've been telling everyone about it. My sister has started using it as well and her acne cleared up in less than a week. It was crazy. I wouldn't waste you money on anything else before you try what I've been using.Just copy the link below into your browser and check out their website.(I couldn't figure out how to put a link in here?!?)[...]
2,Very Late,"I ordered this a very long time ago, and still have not received it. On Amazon it was listed in stock, so it was surprising when I received the email about it being delayed. I have since seen it in my local drugstore for the same price. Perhaps when it finally arrives it will be fantastic, but I have been asked to review it now, and this is my experience so far."
5,Great Product For Troubled Skin,"With four acne prone teenagers, our family has tried just about every acne product on the market. Proactive worked well with two of our children but is rather expensive. With one son nothing worked, not even prescription meds; that is until we tried AcneFree Severe. Everyone's skin is different, so you may need to try several products to find something that really works for you. However, I highly recommend trying AcneFree Severe before purchasing Proactive. This product may be too strong for someone with a pimple or two, but worked wonders for a very difficult case of acne."
1,I honestly hate to be the negative reviewer...,"Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I wish I could give a reason as to why, but I cannot. What I can tell you is that I have been using it for approx. three months faithfully, only to find that the most it did was transfer my acne colonies in a different direction. Yes, that's right--when one colony disappeared, another appeared just slightly n/s/w/e from the original position. It was very frustrating; I resorted to sleeping in different positions and other potentially helpful measures, but to no avail. Here are the specs of my skin:1. I have extremely dry skin2. I have extremely NON-sensitive skin3. I have acne just about everywhere4. I rarely go out in the sun5. I rarely have any stressI have moved on to another skin care regimen that is doing wonders to my face. Let's hope it doesn't just ""re-transfer"" like this one did!:)"
5,Why so expensive?,Acnefree severe really is great and works well but I can buy it at Taget or from acnefree website for 25-30 bucks. Whats up with that!?
4,Great!,"I've tried Proactiv, and multiple other OTC acne products, I tried Acnefree and it worked better than anything. I then decided to try the ""Severe"" and it is the best."
2,Worked at first,"I bought this for my sister because nothing else has worked for her. This started to work and her acne was clearing up but then it just stopped working and all of her acne came back. YES, She was still using it the same. Don't know what the issue was, however I'm upset I lost money over another failing product."
5,Better than anything else!,"I LOVE this product. I'm 21 and I have a moderate amount of acne. I tried this product first (other than different types of soaps and cleaners) and it worked VERY well. I was thrilled with it. After a while i found some proactiv on a major sale so I figured I'd try it out. I don't think it worked nearly as well as this product. plus this one smells better. you also get more with this product than proactiv. Hands down, i'd buy this over proactiv and I'd suggest it to friends and family."
3,idk what happened,"i have bought this product in the past at a store, and it worked for me once. this time, not at all lol maybe they changed the ingredients? But this did not work at all"
5,amazing results!!!!,"After having spent ""too much money with dermatologist"". My 17 year son bought this out of desperation on one of our vacations. The results have been amazing!!!! Unfortunately it is not available where we live so I have to buy it on line."
1,Disappointing.,"I had very high hopes for this product, as I know many other users did. This stuff actually seem to make my acne worse. It was more ""severe"" on my skin, and didn't help my severe acne. :("
5,Something that finally worked!,"I've pretty much used everything, but nothing worked, until I tried out this product. My T-zone is oily, but the rest of my face is a bit on the dry side, so when I first used this product it dried out my face so much to the point it stung really badly. So I decided to just use the soap on my T-zone for a while, and I got used to it- now i can use it on my whole face, but I only use it on my T-zone bc that's only where I have acne problems. Anyways, this product actually works. I give it 5 stars because it cleared up my face, something I've been longing for for over 3 years. I am so happy."
5,It works!,"Plain and simple, this product works. Im 33 and have been dealing with acne forever. Ive tried everything but Accutane."
2,"I tried, I really did","I really did try to like this book. I certainly expected it to be good, since I've read most of Peggy Moreland's other books and enjoyed most. But this book starts out good and gets boring and stupid really fast. It's filled with cliches and stereotypes (particularly college students, most of which I personally never experienced in my years at college). The heroine starts out fine, but quickly becomes, well, an idiot, with over-blown reactions, spouting off typical ""you've wronged me!"" sayings that make any intelligent female reader grit her teeth and want to fling the book across the room.I couldn't finish this book. Maybe it gets better after page 154, but I figured I'd wasted enough time on it. I won't give up on Peggy Moreland, but I might buy the next one used."
1,An oxymororn for a psychiatrist,"Szasz is a libertarian with hatred for totalitarian governments. Nothing wrong with that. But he teamed up with the Church of Scientology years ago as like-minded bedfellows to ""do in"" the practice of psychiatry. Szasz, most likely because of well-felt political beliefs. The Church of Scientology, most likely because its founder saw psychiatry as competition to his Way to Happiness, the e-meter.Szasz is old thought that has been debunked by current scientific knowledge about the brain."
1,Few ideas,"There are few ideas in this book. With so many books available on Potty Training, this one isn't worth the money."
1,holy hot potato batman!!!!!!,"This films so hot you cant grab it off the shelf, cause if you do your in for the burnout day, waste of time, money and brainwaves.Good lord this movie sucked.All you black belt fans, do not watch this, your probably going to now just to see for yourself.THis was a little kids spoof!It was wacky land meets barney with big trouble in little china except no trouble in china because the..........I cannot waste any more time reviewing this poor excuse for a vhs tape!"
2,Hot What?,The only good thing about this movie is the fight scenes with Kelly looking cool and smooth as usual. Yes Kelly is an outstanding martial artist but Bruce Lee he is not. Kelly only wished to achieve Lee's popularity and skill. But by making movies like this one its a no brainer why Kelly is all but UNKNOWN!
3,Please credit me on your book jacket for the quote.,"Betsy,Please contact me regarding the anthology. I'd like to discuss something urgent with you about the back cover, crediting me by name in further print runs as well as in the review.BestElizabeth"
4,I am vengeance. I am the knight. I am-BATMAN!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great game. In my opinion, at the very least. It has cool graphics, lots of darkness(like any Batman game should)and some interesting enemies, including Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow, just like in the movie. Also, you can use a number of cool weapons, like Batarangs, grapplers, two kinds of gas canisters, and a flurry of vicious live bats. It is also a challenging game, and you can even increase your attacks just by keeping on pressing the B button. On top of that, you can beat up your enemies until they give you information you need. All in all, I like this game A LOT and if you are a Batman fan, it's a definite must have."
4,Good modern soul,"A good modern soul CD. Beverlei has a very nice voice and she can sing. My favorite song is ""Gonna get over you"" a really standout track. Most of the songs are up tempo. The duet with Dennis Taylor is good too (Could be you). The backing is excellent ."
4,My least favorite Lost and Found cd,"But it still gets 4 stars. Honestly, I think the plain old speedwood versions of the songs are way better, with the sole exception of Can't Take Away. The rest of the songs just seem weird played with electric instuments, and the drums just make it seem like it isn't Lost and Found.I would still definitely reccomend this album, but only after getting the Speedwood albuls, Something, etc, all of which were 5 stars in my book. Then again, I don't like most music with drums and electic instruments, so if you do, maybe you will like them on this cd. Either way, just the speedwood versions are well worth getting the cd for, and I also love the last hidden track (1980)."
5,You can only find this book here!,"Stumbled upon this book and read it with sheer delight. Love the characters, the story line, the fast pace. I hope there is a new work on the way. Get it here and get it now - I have recommended this book to a bunch of friends who have had trouble getting a copy. It is definitely worth the quest. An excellent and truly entertaining read."
2,???,"First off, I've never been able to get past ten pages whenever I've sat down to try to write a novel. Consequently, I automatically have tremendous respect for anyone who can actually stay the course. Nevertheless, I found this novella to be very disappointing. I'm not sure why all these other reviewers seem so amazed by it. There was a story, sure, but it wasn't at all clear to me WHY there was a story. In other words, I couldn't see why there was a story worth telling here. Maybe I'm a snob, but I expect a little more depth to a story than just a chronicle of the sexual misadventures of an adolescent twentysomething. It was kind of funny sometimes, but ultimately it was pointless."
2,I can't believe this got so many good reviews,"I bought this book because of the good reviews it received on Amazon and because it was compared to the works of Tom Robbins and Christopher Moore, both of whom I love. But, to compare this book to those authors' work is downright insulting to Robbins and Moore. This book wants to be a screenplay and it reads like one. The dialogue is so trite that it made me cringe to read it and the character development was also very poor. It was very difficult to finish this book even though it was relatively short."
4,More More More,I went to look for Tom Robbins and was gifted with Mr. Haskett. It was fun to break into one of the frequent giggles as the story unfolded. I for one would buy anything you write. I wait with paitience......
5,A great vacation read!,"I do a lot of reading but I really gauge my books on how much I would prefer to sit and read them vs. doing something else (e.g., watch television, go to the movies, see friends). This is one of those books that call on you to read them when ever time allows. It's a hard book to put down and I was really engaged by the storytelling and the variety of characters. Take this book to the beach and relax and get caught up in the world of Duncan Delaney."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"I did not enjoy this book at all. The pace was slow, the plot was pointless, and the characters lacked depth. I purchased this book based on reviews that compared the author to Tom Robbins. I had very high expectations based on those reviews. Unfortunately, this book did not deliver."
3,Banjamin alone is worth the ride,"""Quick, easy and fun"" ... yup, that's how I found A.L. Haskett's debut novel, Duncan Delaney & the Cadillac of Doom.I'm not sure why Bantam compares Haskett to Tom Robbins per se. Actually, I would compare him to Hemmingway or Chandler just as much as I would compare him to Robbins, which isn't saying there's an obvious comparison at all, really. His characters are unconventional, sure, but his writing style is simple, streamlined and almost journalistic. This, all in all, makes the book easy to zip through.The only issue I had was with Duncan Delaney; I didn't find him a great protangonist. I didn't find his dialogue all that real, which made it difficult to keep my interest. But Benjamin Lonetree, on the other hand, is great fun and redeems Haskett's ability to characterize. His dialogue is fresh, his actions are bold, and he just outshines all the characters in the book."
4,Duncan Delaney motors along,"""Duncan Delaney"" is a great read. It reminds me of early Tom McGuane or Tom Robbins. The story moves right along, from Wyoming to Hollywood, and it kept me laughing all the way. The characters are always entertaining, if sometimes a bit surreal or cartoonish (but in a good way) and I always cared about what happened to them, sometimes more than the charcters seemed to care about themselves. It's both funny (laugh out loud funny) and touching, but I felt a little let down at the ending. I look forward to more from Haskett, and will definately buy his next book."
2,Boring,"I found this slow to read. Only part way through but now archived. I really tried to keep going, but, yawning doesn't help."
2,Boring,"This book was boring and nearly insults the reader's intelligence. It was short and took forever to finish reading. I don't understand why it is recommended to me..repeatedly, but I really didn't get anything out of it."
4,"I... liked it, not bad","Its true that I liked the book... after I read it. The way it made me feel in the end adn the way I keep thinking about the characters. I think thats when a book is good, just like a movie, when it can still leave you sad after youve put it down."
1,Very disappointed with Don't Waste Money Spend It,"I teach a class on frugal living and bought this book in hopes it would offer new insights and things to share with my students, most of whom live in poverty. I really feel like I wasted the $10 I paid for this poorly written and edited book. I read the entire book in less than two hours and was still waiting for the ""Madcap adventures in frugality"" when I read the last page. A very big disappointment, and if I were to follow her advice, I would write to her and demand my money back."
5,"Don't waste time, buy it !!","Don't Waste Money, Spend It by Lisa Wysocki is a must read for everyone! It's an easy to read, smart and witty guide to spending money wisely. It is filled with sound advice on building the all-important nest egg. Ms. Wysocki's step by step approach will make the most ardent spendthrift repent.Through her many tips and anecdotes, I feel empowered as a consumer. I will no longer cower and accept inferior service or merchandise. I will continue to use this invaluable book as a reference to help me reduce waste and fight for my rights and my money."
4,A quick and fun read,"The fun little stories gave good solid examples of how Lisa Wysocki came to acquire the knowledge she shares in her book. I found myself laughing out loud to myself on more than one occassion. Although some of the information is the same old advice recycled (only buy the stuff you really need), other information was less ""common knowledge."" I enjoyed the book, and hope she writes another."
5,Audio-Technica AT-LP2DA LP Review,Great way to convert your old albums to cd's! The Cakewalk software is a great bonus!
4,"Great product, but....","This turntable does what it's supposed to do and does it very well, however, the software is somewhat awkward and takes a lot of reading through the help sections to understand how to make the features work. With some practice you can create very nice cds, but it would be nice if the process were more automated (i.e. track separation, noise reduction, etc.). Overall I'm quite happy with purchase."
3,recording CD dificulties,"about to recording from LP to my computer it was very good. but I think there is some truble on the software because following your instrucción can't burn the CD. Appear the dialog foor burning, it seems to be burning, but after finish you find the CD has not been touch.Tomas Reyes"
4,Audio-Technica AT-LP2DA LP-to-Digital Recording System,I found this item to be exactly what I needed to get my record collection onto CD's. I had a lot of records which are irreplaceable and are not as yet and probably never will be out on CD.I did have trouble getting the system hooked up properly in the beginning.The company gave me guidance over the internet which helped to correct the problem.Dennis Day
1,Right on time but with missing parts,"Even though the package arrived on time before Christmas, the equipment came without the rubber record mat (to protect the LP from being scratched by the turntable).I tried to communicate with the seller to solve the problem but they didn't replyied. I asked them only for the record mat, or at least a refund on the value of the mat, but without a response by them.Careful with what you order with them the next time."
4,"Copied my LP to a wav file, then CD, just fine","The hardware has easy to follow instructions. The software, not so much, but with the aid of these reviews on Amazon it wasn't too hard. The first try, I recorded the wav file from my LP, and split it into tracks ok, but when I burned the CD it only recorded the first track. Then I tried again, numbering all the tracks (and skipping the dead space where I turned the record over) and VOILA - a playable CD. I figured it out trial and error. I didn't find the online help very useful. I'm a newbie to digital audio files so this may be obvious to most people.Who knows, maybe this'll make me buy an MP3 player so I can try making mp3 files."
5,Great Product!!,"I bought the product to convert my LPs to CDs. The turntable was easy to assemble (just remember to set the pre-amp to ON). The Pyro 5 was also easy to install (you have to register the product).Initially, I was not able to record. I could listen to the music via the PC speakers. Contacted Audio technica twice, via email, and they responded promptly both times. Corrected the problem by connecting the cables to the AUDIO IN, in the back of the PC (I was using the LINE IN at the front).Suggestion, request from Audio Technica, their guides to connect and to record (they are very, very good, you'll save time and aggravation). Especially the steps to follow, when you are going to record. Before recording, check the volume is not too loud when playing your LP. The Pyro Volume Window will tell you and you adjust the volume.The recorded CDs are fantastic! The music sounds better than when playing LPS. Your LPs will come to life!!! Great stuff!!"
1,Very poor performer,"Others might have better luck, but the one I got was just trash. The amplifier didn't work (I did find the hidden switch to turn it on, but turning it on had no effect), the turntable was bottom of the barrel, and the stylus just skated across my lp's.I do appreciate that Amazon took this back and gave me a credit, no questions asked."
4,Excellent hardware - good software,"No problem setting up the turntable and connecting it to my computer. You have to register the software to have full functionality. The software copies the record tracks to a .wav file, then you must indicate tracks, then convert them to mp3, wma etc., then burn your CD. On the Pyro website, click on MANUAL to find an excellent online help for the software. That is where I learned how to name each track."
4,Perfect for my needs,"The turntable worked perfectly out of the box. Very easy to use to convert vinyl to digital. My interest is just to make CDs, not MP3s and the like. I followed the advice of others and did not bother to install the provided software. My preference is Audiograbber, a free ripper that will sense the silence between tracks and break them up automatically. You can also use it to make MP3s, etc."
3,Software Nightmare,"Although the turntable is actually better than average and performs really well, the software really stinks. If a company is going to use software like this is they should add a comprehensive owners manual to be used with the help folders. I have had the system for two days and still have a ways to go to use many of the functions. I am considering sending this one back and trying another brand."
4,LP-to-Dig,"Although I feel that this product is just slightly ""misadvertised"", once you get it out of the box and set up...it does exactly what it should: play LPs. Once I got it connected to my PC, all was well. Works fine, no issues."
3,Audio- Technica Digital Recording System,Had problem getting started . Instructions were a little fuzzy.Did not tell you that you had to register first before it wouldplay. That piece of imformation would have me a lot of time.they need redo their book. Also did not know what the (time remaining)meant. Does that mean it will quit recording at some point.Other than that it works fine.Paul
5,Easy to use,This product is easy to use. I am converting my husband's album collection to mp3s. I was afraid that it would be confusing and too hard for me to learn. But my son was able to install it and figure it out without too much difficulty. Now us Baby Boomers are able to enjoy the songs of our youth again.
1,not as it appears,"very disapointed. this is nothing but a regular component record player with a miniplug adapter and CD in the box with it. if you already have a record player, get the free software and an adapter, and youl have better than this. no digital conversion, no usb. its all software, and not very good software at that. your system needs windows media player to work, and there is no easy direct MP3 conversion. its barely more than recording the line in on your regular sound card software. im serioulsy considering sending it back."
4,Ripping LPs for my IPod,I got this a couple of weeks back. The s/w installed very easily and despite no documentation it is pretty easy to use. The only catch for me was that on my initial recordings the playback was great but when I replayed the recordings they were terrible. Windows had the Audio recording source as my Webcam and what was recorded was the sound coming out of the speakers being picked up by the Webcam. Once that was corrected via Windows Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices -> Audio tab -> Sound Recording (Default Device) the recordings were great. I haven't even bothered running any filters to take out the hiss yet as it is pretty insignificant.You have to set the input recording level before starting to record but that is a minor setup that will avoid problems later.The turntable itself is simple to set up and use. Not the greatest turntable ever but at the price it is a complete steal.I now get to listen to all my old albums on my IPod and am delighted with the purchase.
4,Audio-Technica AT-LP2DA LP-to-Digital Recording System,"This is an easy way to do some fairly sophisticated stuff. Just connect following the directions-- which are easy to follow--and you can digitize vinyl records to make CDs in several formats. The sofware also allows you to play amateur audio engineer, which is fun. The cartridge seems quite small and fragile, compared to older systems, but the sound is great to my untrained ear and CD's I've made and played on my high quality auto sound system sound great."
1,Not a Digital Transfer,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother assuming that it had one of the standard digital connections for a computer (USB cord, etc) like every other version of this type of product I've since found. It actually only has rc imputs that specifically don't work with any mic imput - so, you are basically left with a plain old turntable without any new way of connecting to a computer or creating digital files. Look elsewhere if you dont have one of the few high end sound cards that have the specific input you need for this product. The software was also overly complex and not intuitive at all. Lame."
1,"No CD burning, burn your money","Purchasing this product, you might be able to burn CD's, but most likely, you'll burn your money.It's actually a good standart turntable with a RCA to miniplug adaptor.They talk about a preamp switch, but they forget to place it on the product.Software is lousy -close to garbage-. In order to record my vinil records on CD, I had to buy another software, wich worked better.It actually could be considered a misleading advertising."
4,Great if you need Pyro,"The Audio-Technica AT-LP2DA LP-to-Digital Recording System is a nice, easy to use system for ripping your vinyl to digital format. It is easy to set up and use. Although it is not super audiophile quality, the results are very good.I generally use Adobe Audition for most of my audio recording and editing needs and for file conversions, but I found that Pyro works better for recording my albums. After recording I use Audition to split, clean and tweak my files. If you already have software that you are comfortable with, then you can buy the Audio Technica AT-PL50 Belt Drive Turntable. It is the exact same turntable only it doesn't include the Pyro software and it costs $17 less. The Pyro software is probably worth the difference though because it does much more than just ripping vinyl."
2,"Fine turntable, awful software","The turntable is simple and easy to set up. Easy to connect to the laptop (although the instructions say you can't use the mic input, it actually doubles as the line-in, so it does work). The software is a joke. It claims to do all sorts of fun things with editing, but unless you have weeks of free time it would be difficult to figure it out. I was able to record some LP's, but the ""help section"" is useless. Much of what it describes can't even be found on the software. It shows functions that aren't there. It also claims to record from the internet but doesn't work on my computer. It's a fine product if you want to do basic recording, but not much good for anythinig else."
1,More headache-inducing than helpful,"I received this for Christmas and am returning it. The problems are numerous, primarily with the software.First, it is not compatible with Mac. Second, it will only work with Windows Vista after a download of the 48MB patch from the Cakewalk site.Once installed, the software suffers from serious usability issues. Nothing is intuitive, and the ""tips"" are self-contradictory. In an age in which one can buy a song for less than a dollar with the click of a mouse, there are better options for replacing your LPs and 45s than this.Avoid this product."
4,New turntable 4 Old vinyl!!,"This is a GREAT starter table 4 getting my LPs & 12"" vinyl onto CD format!! WAY COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing price & by the time I was talking about this at work - the turntable was already on my doorstep!! VERY FAST & wonderful servive!!"
1,AT-LP2DA is cheap,"My Audio-Technica AT-LP2DA turntable arrived DOA, so I was not able to hear the sound quality reproduction. What I DID see frightened me; the turntable had no tracking mass adjustment, no anti-skating adjustment, and no strobe for speed adjustment. It was belt drive. In summary, if one had a few dozen LPs to digitize, it might do. Otherwise, upgrade to the Audio-Technica AT-PL120S; for twice the money, you get three times the turntable, and will NOT be sorry.I found the Cakewalk Pyro 5 software to be non-intuitive, but VERY powerful."
3,So-So,"I bought this item with great anticipation that it would work with no difficulty. The directions are very vague, but with a little fiddling around, I managed to make it work. They sure could do a little more to the directions."
1,Junk,"Total waste of money. The mic picks up the movement of the arm, when it comes into contact with the record, the actual turning of the turn table. The software is horible. It is so bad, I ended up getting my portable voice and holding the mic up to the speakers. It came out so much better than this junk. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!"
4,LPs to CDs,"This turntable worked as well as you can expect. Everything about setting it up was easy but when it came time to use the enclosed software, PYRO Audio Creator and Audacity, I ran into trouble. I couldn't get either one to work and ended up using a Roxio program (which was totally up to the job). For $100 it's worth it."
5,Where to put your old vinyl? - on a cd,The system was easy set up and install. The turntable works well and the sound is of good quality even on very old scratched records. There are no directions as to how to burn or manipulate the music files but it is fairly intuitive. It takes a little time to figure out how to manipulate the files but the whole process is time consuming because you are playing records and not just downloading music files. I am very happy with the system.
4,Software a little complicated,Bought this for my husban'd birthday and he's not a huge computer guy. He was able to figure out how to separate the songs after playing with it for about an hour. Documentation that comes with it is pretty thin. He's ripped 15 of his Misfits/old punk albums so far and is ready to do more. It's funny how you get spoiled with uploading CD's at 4x speed - you actually have to play the whole album with this. It's just time consuming.
3,Vinyl to CD was Pretty Easy,"The Audio-technica AT-LP2D USB turntable was easy to assemble and attach to my computer. The software married easily with Vista. I have recorded several albums and used the ""clean-up"" software. You still have the analog sound.It does what you think it will if you are not a romantic. I will get rid of my old albums but keep the music."
3,what is digital about it?,The turntable is excellent and nice to use but what is digital about it? The analog audio cord comes with an adapter to plug into the analog audio input of your computer audio card. The only thing digital is your own computer. The software could not be opened without first registering so it is impossible to try it out without going on the internet and registering. I haven't figured out how any of the digital features have to do with the turntable and since the turntable output is too high for the microphone input on my laptop (which is the only input)I can't record yet. I would use my desk computer but the software only supports XP and W2000 so I am out of luck there too. Well the price was reasonable for a turntable with cartridge so I didn't get took even if I can't use the software for much. TIM CUTFORTH
1,Not what it's cracked up to be.,I really got the impression I wasn't going to need any additional parts... Not True be aware you will need an amplifier
4,LP to Digital Recording System,"This is such a fun system. I have over 300 albums (yes some of them are disco!) and recording them to CD has been a blast. I am able to custom make CDs. Haven't got into all the different features to manipulate the sound, but working on it. p.s. the price was right!"
3,Instructions Lacking but Hardware Works Very Well,Audio-Technica AT-LP2DA LP-to-Digital Recording SystemSet up is easy and the basic recording tasks are straightforward. Track identification and editing are much harder and came to me only after trial and error. I still don't know everything needed to complete the record/edit/improve/file cycle. It will come eventually.
2,really crummy software interface,"Transferring the first album to my PC took roughly 5 hours. The second took 3.5 hours, the third about 2 hours and the fourth about 1.5 hours.Learning the software interface took an inordinate amount of time, even though I've been an interface programmer.After learning the software, it appears every album will cost about an hour to record, mark the songs, name the songs and write the songs as MP3. If I want to edit out song parts or eliminate pops/clicks, it will take longer.It's really time consuming and the software doesn't make it simple or intuitive.The turntable is of reasonable quality. It's just a regular turntable with a built-in pre-amp. You turn the pre-amp `on' when recording to your PC, turn if `off' if you want to use the turntable with your regular stereo."
3,Mixed review,"After hooking up this product to my PC I was very satisfy with the sound of my old records. I consider the sound excellent. But the transfered music to CD is noisy and of poor quality. Of course, I am not a recording engineer byany means. I also found that the sound quality tools provided with this product are not that helpful."
1,Broke after 2 months,"Not only did this machine break after 2 months (an error message indicated that I had to return the machine to the manufacturer to have the ""computer board"" fixed), the customer service was awful. I had to call repeatedly to get help, including numerous messages with the Customer Service Supervisor, who never called me back at all. This machine is also very high-maintenance - if you're buying it for milk drinks, be prepared for an extremely rigid cleaning procedure, which is an enormous hassle. I strongly encourage people to avoid this machine. I would suggest the Jura Z5, which does cost about $400 more, but at this price point, save yourself the aggravation."
1,One week and..no more proper milk frothing,"The machine made the best cappuccino ever during its first week of operation, a LOT better than dunkin donuts or starbucks. Fresh ground coffee, one button operation, best milk froathing ever. Err...until the first week. After that the machine somehow stop producing that nice foam and it was instead producing a 'watery' kind of milk. Tried 4 different kinds of milks and still no luck. Also, the cappuccino temperature was never hot enough so that the coffee stays warm while you hold say when waiting for the train. It's going back to J&R tomorrow - who by the way has an offer on it for 2000$. Good luck Saeco."
1,Constantly breaking down,I strongly recommend that no one buys this machine. We have had one for 2 years and sorely regret buying it. It has been in the repair shop for well over 8 months at various times. It is simply not made to last. Dont say you wern't warned.
1,Mold and mildew Yuk,"This machine was rediculous. It was returned within 3 weeks. It would constantly ask you to clean the milk unit and run the cleaning cycle every day. If you do not, it builds up mold and mildew. Was a nightmare.The touch screen did not work well either. You press one thing and another function was activated.done with Saeco"
2,Three Strikes and on to Jura,"I was incredibly enthusiastic when I originally purchased this machine... I mean, this was the ultimate gadget freak's full-automatic capuccino maker - with a color touch screen! Wow! And the first few weeks were good (with the exception of the coolish latte macchiatos and the machine enforcing a totalitarian cleaning regime). But then the problems began.According to Saeco, the machine would get air bubbles in its internal tubing and would start to sputter endlessly, then ask to be restarted. It would take me 15 minutes to an hour of starting and restarting the machine to coax them out, if I could at all. I got a replacement machine, and the same thing happened again.In the end, I gave up and the wonderful store I do business with replaced it with a Jura Z5 (with an additional payment, of course, because Jura is top-of-the-line stuff). Jury is still out on the Z5, but I can tell you that after years with Saeco, I'm pretty much done with them."
1,Huh?,"I agree with R.V. There is no reason to allow sloppy playing in a professional orchestra recording. You do it over until you get it right. No excuse. I have always had a soft spot for the Russian orchestras, but let's face it, they are not on the A-list equal to Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, etc. Also, for a modern day digital recording the mixing should be first rate and almost perfect.There are just too many mistakes made in creating this recording to make it stand up with the others out there. Chicago/Ozawa, now that's a nice recording. Boulez/Cleveland, awesome. I don't like listening to my favorite pieces and hearing orchestra clams. They should be caught by a conductor who is paying attention even if the mood is wonderful, mistakes should not be recorded. People who know the score may be listening."
2,Mp3 version: Not Gapless,"In general I was impressed with this recording, until I noticed a brief hesitation between segments as the player (foobar2000) switched tracks. Same problem in iTunes.Such things used to happen all the time. Mp3 is a somewhat flawed technology that wants to put empty space at the beginnings and ends of files.However, files I rip myself include extra info (called ""delay"" and ""padding"") which specify how much space there will be and allow the player to compensate. That's not the case here. I am disappointed."
3,I'll Stick With Boulez,"I listened to this with much anticipation, having heard Gergiev several times with the N.Y Philharmonic. I also think his and the Kirov's recording of the Firebird is the best I have ever heard. Thus, I was disappointed with this recording. I felt that the performance was understated, certain segments sounded rushed to me, and basically I didn't hear anything new. I'll stay with the Boulez recording (the first one I ever bought) from now on.By the way, the most thrilling ""Rite"" I have ever heard was Christophe Eschenbach conducting the NY Philharmonic last year."
2,"Contemporary Philosophy, By Fredrick Copleston","I bought this book las December, and I have never received it, although I paid for it.I sent many letters reporting this to you, asking for help, and always reported the sale's number, and received from you the same request again and again without any results. I have kept all your letters and my letters in a file, and I plan to write a letter of complaint along with the file to the Attorney's general office. The way you treated me was very undfair!Michael H. Mitias"
5,An Exotic Girl.,"This doll is beautiful! She is rather gothic, but it's very attractive, if you think on it. Her hair was loose on the sides and did not complement the dress very well,but it is easily pulled back with a clear band. Her arrival outfit is cute and sporty, but I love her dress with the Faux suede blossom. Her best features are her deep auburn highlights (look closely- they're there!) and her mesmorizing violet eyes. Well worth it."
1,Girls gone wild...,"This really looks like a hoochie Barbie!! I can't believe people would buy this for their kids...they belong on the Girls gone wild videos.....This whole line of dolls is so degrading, is this what you want your kids to wear?!"
1,First Time I've been sorry for buying a barbie!,I bought this barbie (My Sceen-Nolee) for my 9 year old daughter. I didn't think there was a problem until she asked me what a communist was. I asked her where she heard that word. She told me on the Barbie (My Sceen-Nolee) Cd. The Song is Soak up the Sun by Sheryl Crow. I never thought I would have to check out Barbie products. This is the first. My daughter and I have been collecting Barbies for about 8 years. So this is the first time I've been very upset. We are 100% Proud Americans and love our freedom in the wonderful United States. I hope you listen to the cd and send me a reply on why you would have something about communist on our childrens toys. Debbie Demke. P.s. Waiting for a reply........
5,"Her City, Her Style 2002!","This was my first MyScene ever! I love her because she is SO cool! Any way,what she includes is, her little pug Cookie, a sweet bikini, a extra dress, a brush. What she's wearing is, a halter top, a purse (which is SUPER cute!), shorts with a REALLY cute belt, sandal styled shoes, and a visor. She I should mention has two (2) braids in her hair (which by the way is really soft and manageable). Hope this helps! :)"
5,The trendiest Barbie collection to date.,"I purchased Nolee and Chelsea last week. I had seen them at the store and thought they we're very cute. I have a 3 year old daughter who I planned to give them to, yet when they arrived yesterday I decited to put them away until she gets older. These are made for the pre-teen girls who are too old for the original Barbie yet still young enough to play with hip dolls. I'll admit it, I opened both Nolee and Chelsea and had fun putting on the outfits on them. My 3 year old had a hard time trying to dress them yet she loved the idea that mommy was playing Barbie's with her. The CD that came with Nolee has music that I don't typically listen to, I did not find it offensive like the other lady did, yet everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I am a proud American who has family right now fighting in the war. It's times like these that we need something to get our minds off our problems, if Barbie and friends can help, more power to them."
3,this toy is OK,nolee is okay but she is not my favorite my scene. I dont HATE her but she is not my favorite. I like bratz better but no offence to the my scene lovers!!! Her clothes are okay but they are NOT skimpy!!! I noticed on her halter that the ribbon frayed and now i cannot get her halter on and off easily. she is cool but i would rather have a bratz!! remember everyone has differint opinions about her and if you have your mind set on getting this doll dont let me get in your way!!!
4,very warm boot,"very sturdy, warm boot, can feel the warmth instantly as soon as I put them on.true to size.the look of the boot is casual, high shaft.they are made in Canada with good quality."
4,A Nice Little Referance For the Kubrick Fan,"Yes, Kagan does make some foolish mistakes in summing up Kubrick's films. However, this is a nice book for anyone interested in the late Stanley Kubrick, a film genius whose works ranged from sexual thrillers and science fiction epics to period dramas and war films. It contains some nice photos, as well as just enough information about each film. I bought it after seeing only three of Kubrick's films and it compelled me to see five more."
1,This is the most shallow and worthless book on Kubrick.,"If I could give less than one star, I would. This book sheds no light on Kubrick's genius whatsoever. The majority of the book is a sort of Cliff's Notes on nearly every film Kubrick has made. The capsulation of these films are so brief and hollow, that he covers a work like A Clockwork Orange in a mere 20 pages. Not only that, but the book is full of errors when lines are quoted and references made. If you want a REAL book on Kubrick, read Mario Falsetto's works on this directoral master. I will use Mr. Kagan's, however, as a beer coaster."
1,Worthless,"I don't know why film critics think they can get away with this kind of thing. Imagine if somebody tried to ""critique"" a novel, a CD, or any other type of work by retelling the narrative (or lyrics, or whatever) in his own words. Dismissed without a second thought, needless to say. But film critics write 'em and get 'em published. To what end, I don't know.That said, this book plumbs new depths in that it's ALL the author does. There's no technical background or critical apparatus at all, merely scene by scene retellings of the films along with a bit of blather about ""themes"". The book's errors have been mentioned, but it should be reiterated that these are of a number and level of ignorance that's truly jaw-dropping. (My favorite is Kagan's identification of the drunken Shriners of ""Killer's Kiss"" as ""some kind of street entertainers"".)One of these days, Kubrick will get the film-by-film analysis he deserves. This one ain't even a beginning."
2,Parrot Talk and Kubrick,"Norman Kagan should get an ""editing"" credit rather than ""author"" credit. This book on the cinema of Stanley Kubrick is basically an accumulation of articles, interviews and reviews of his films and his life. Albeit some of it was interesting, the book is nothing I found original. At the end of each chapter, however, the author does take it upon himself to interpret the films in a manner in which he sees a destructive, non-sexual, non-emotional Kubrick. That of obsessive and homicidal. Attempting to make a ""connection"" in all the films which I believe is poorly attempted. I would move elsewhere to find word on Kubrick and his films."
2,The Kelly Family,"I have been a big Kelly fan for years, but they haven't produced a good CD in years. I hope they go back to their roots and make the next CD fabulous. Love to see them on top again."
5,Another Smash Hit Album for Europe's Best Band,"It has been four years since the Kelly Family's last new album, and it was well worth the wait. Even though this band was one of the biggest hit-makers in Europe through the '90s, they're virtually unheard of here in the States...too bad, they have one of the best sounds of any band I've heard in many, many years...and I work in radio! If you've never heard of the Kelly's, check out their 'Best of 1 and 2' cd's first, then get 'La Patata.' You won't be disappointed. p.s., there's a bonus song on the c.d that is not listed in the track listings.After the last song, 'Life can be so beautiful,' there is about 30 seconds of silence and then the song 'Audry' plays. Why it's not listed on the track listing is beyond me, but it's a very cool song from Maite. Enjoy!!!"
3,Kelly Family,"CD surface is not 100% perfect, first song doesn't play in home hi-fi; nevertheless, the package is like-new and tunes are great!"
4,Nice Surprise,"After hearing 'I can't help myself' (Almost Heaven) I became a huge fan and found a lot of previous albums had very good songs. Last year however I didn't see this new album near where I live and only bought it now. It was a very nice surprise, different to the others and very enjoyable. The sound and vocals are excellent in 'Love Music and Sun'."
4,A neglected masterpiece,"We badly need to have this book once more available. Full of insights into the meaning of human life in nature, it also chronicles the passing of a virgin landscape in S.America with the coming of a predatory civilization. Hudson came of age with little schooling but endless hours of observing life (especially birds) and reading. His friends in England, where he went in his 30s, often wondered why he was habitually sad. This profound reminiscence explains why."
5,"Good solid construction, quality product.","It was everything I was hoping: a quality solid product that does what it is supposed to. Mounting was simple and it works great for my closet needs as a suit/laundry service valet.Bar is solid chrome-plated metal. Housing is well made, powder coated white. Extension length is perfect, and it looks good as well."
3,"Great content, didn't enjoy reading it","This book has an amazing amount of information in it about Halloween from the Celtic period to post 9/11 and anyone wanting to learn about the history of the holiday over this entire span should start with this book.I can't fault the author in any way for what is written, my problem was with how it was written. It didn't seem as though the author enjoyed the holiday and that made the writing seem kind of gray to me, not enjoyable as it would be with someone who really loves the holiday.Still a great reference book though."
3,"A Hard Read, But Well Informed","This book actually has a lot of detail on the history of Halloween. From its beginnings to its modern day traditions, this book seems to cover it all. You can tell that the author has done his research.However, this book is a hard read. It reads like a college professor's thesis full of large, exaggerating words and sentences rather than a reader-friendly book.The only other distracting thing about this book is it's continuous mention of homosexual Halloween traditions. This history gets its own introduction AND chapter, which is quite distracting when when you are trying to read the history and then reminded about the parades and flamboyant costumes of the gay community.Aside from this criticisms, this is an informative book. If you want a brief history of Halloween, go somewhere else. But if you want a true (time comsuming!) commentary, then this is a good find."
3,"Now, now, now!","Holly and Alexander, you two just stop it right now! And Michael, you stay out of it."
1,Defective dvd,"I ordered this for my son's 16th birthday and he was very excited until he tried to play it and found it was defective. The vendor claimed we must have ruined the dvd and would only issue a partial refund. Amazon did not help much either. My son plays many dvds, games etc and is very careful with his stuff. The bottom line was that this was a terrible experience."
2,Killer Priest,"I just finished reading the book. The material about Hans Schmidt, taken from the local newspapers, trial transcripts, and other documentation was fairly interesting, but the material about the Louisville case of the murdered child is pure fiction. Schmidt was never assigned to St. John's church. He was a visitor at another church. I saw one newspaper article that stated mistakenly that Schmidt was assigned to St. John's. I've been researching this case for a number of years and have found no evidence that Schmidt was ever at St. John's. The child who vanished had only been to the church once before and did not attend St. John's school. If there is evidence that Schmidt was at St. John's the day the child disappeared or the day her body was found, I'd love to see it."
5,"To be fair about this product, understand what it is for!","I saw the other two reviews and wanted to say that my research indicates that gypsum can be very useful, for example, where patches of lawn are damaged by pet urine and the soil needs to be neutralized. Gypsum can help where more calcium is needed but unlike lime it enriches the soil without raising Ph. So, just reserach what your soil needs first before buying. As to the price, Amazon is especially convenient when you just want something delivered to the door farily quickly, but if you really want to compare prices and are willing to telephone and drive to local places, just do that! You could call local places first, then check and compare on Amazon. The other reviews are not really about this product itself."
1,Gypsum is a gyp,Gypsum is not a fertilizer. It is not a soil conditioner. It is a source of sulphur for soils. It will help reduce the sodium content in highly salty soil. But it will not add calcium to the soil or raise the Ph. There is very little need for use by gardeners in most of the US. Save your money. Get a soil test from your local or state ag university or extension service to see what you would need in fertilizer or compost.
3,"Old songs, but some good ones.","This CD is one of his earlier ones, it mixes fast, upbeat songs, with slow, love ballads. Still, some very nice ones! ""Uncle Borya"" is one of my favorites!"
5,Sue Miller is specifc and detailed,We've been working on a lot of material on voice and accent for Indian Call Centers dealing with the American market.This appears to be the best book I have come across.It is very detailed and easy to understand and beats the current book and CD offerings like American Accent training.A definite must buy if you are into accent reduction for individuals or training.Ian SternHolistic Enterprise
1,Terrible!,Used this racquet for a few weeks & it cracked. The frame is about as thick as a few sheets of paper. Compete piece of junk. The company won't answer my letters.
1,"I'm sure this item is quality, but...","No WAY is this a 374.00 racquet!!! From someone who plays and knows, this item is no discounted bargain, it is valued appropriately at the ""discounted"" rate though, but thats poor form and misleading on the seller's part PNC!"
5,"Algo nuevo para sus fans, que rico!","Thalia, como siempre, nos sigue sorprendidnedo cada vez que saca un disco al mercado. Esta vez nos ofrece un trabajo un poco dificil de describir, la musica es una mezcla de 80's/Rock/Pop, es una obra maestra, su voz se luce al maximo. La primera vez que escuches este disco talvez no te cause un gran impacto pero despues de escucharlo una segunda vez empezaras a darte cuenta de lo bueno que esta. Mejores canciones ""Tu y Yo"", ""No me enseñaste"", ""A quien le importa"", ""La Loca"", tambien destacan las tres canciones en ingles ""The Mexican 2000 (el titulo no tiene nada que ver con la canción), Closer to you (muy bella balada) y ""You spin me round"" indiscutiblemente, Thalia logra lo que se propone, esta vez fue un disco lleno de musica fresca, sonido de alta calidad, un sentimiento inconfundible....te dejara queriendo MAS!"
3,"Not bad, but not Thalia's best work","I bought this CD with high hopes thinking it would be as good asArrasndo and Thalia's other CDs, but it's not. The CD doesn't totally bite, but it just isn't the Thalia that I have grown to know and love. It's something about voice in this CD it just isn't as strong as it was in her other CDs. As for the English tracks her accent isn't perfect, but you try singing in a different language and see how well you do. Thalia me encanta tu trabajo, tu musica, y tus novelas espero que tengas exito en tu ""debut"" en ingles y por favor HAGA OTRO DISCO CON BANDA!"
1,I guess if you married a rich old men is ok to sing so bad!,"What the .... where they thinking when they decieded to put out this piece of garbage. T H A L I A D O E S N 'T K N O W H O W T O S I N G , get it , she dosen't know how to sing.Somebody needs to tell her that, ya es hora que le pongan un STOP a tanta llamada ""musica"" que no tiene nada de talento es todo computer work.So People Outthere don't buy this cd is all GARBAGE."
1,"Poor production, Poor English&#65533;","I heard the entire CD only once. I couldn't understand a word she was saying.""Tu y yo"" is a boring, boring song. Is nothing, just nothing!""A quien le importa"" was a great to begin with...Thalia's interpretation is ""Ok"" no excellent.""Closer tu yo"", ""You spin me round"" ""The mexican"" The songs are not great, her English is poor.Thalia is trying to hard to imitate Shakira, Paulina Rubio and JLO...Thalia, I don't know who advised you to do that, but believe me...IS A BAD ADVISE!!!Stick to your spanish songs until you improve your english. Be YOU!! be original, don't imitate! That never works....!!I do not recommend this CD. However, I am not giving up on her yet, hopefully her next production is better."
1,"Thalia singing ""You spin me rrrooounddd???","I cant believe she had the nerve to sing this song!!! she doesnt have the style to do so! i feel the same way about her other remakes! [...]!!! Thalia sure is very pretty but lacks so much in talent., not the best of voices and not the best dancer., I went to Dead or Alives concert in San Francisco nobody in this planet could sing ""YOU SPIN ME ROUND "" as Pete Burns does!!!"
1,Worst CD Thalia has ever made,"What can you expect when you are rushing to take out an album. Thalia has demonstarted not only in this album but in her new style of dressing that she is not unique at all and that she has an identity issue.The worst thing about this album has to be the fact that Tommy Mottola her husband and CEO of Sony Records, has used his connections to get MArc Anthony to do a horrible remake duet with Thalia. The song ""The Mexican 2002"" is a remake of the famous 80's freestyle song. Not to mention another remake in English called ""You spin me round"" We all remember that song, I bet, well she killed it. You can't you hear what she is saying in her English songs and her voice on the Spanish wanna-be Shakira tracks are not suitable with her music.Bottom Line:Hubby is paying to make her famous and not working, her talent is lost."
3,Not her best,"En Extasis [bad], Amor a la Mexicana was better, Arrasando was EVEN better, and this one slipped on the way to the top of the rest below. She still has talent with ballads, but she's lost her touch with the faster songs. As always, they start out with an attractive beat that keeps your toe tapping, but after a short time they drag and leave you pushing the button for the next track and that happens again until you reach the end of the cd to ""You Spin Me 'Round"". This song is not for everyone and it is certainly not for Thalia. Not only because she doesn't have too much experience with Rock music, but because her English is as bad as this song. But I still love her!!"
3,a bit disappointed....,"After the extremely hot, and energetic ""ARRASANDO"" CD I perhaps was expecting some of the same on this CD. Unfortunately, as much as I love her, I was disappointed. ""You spin me round"" (the old Dead or alive number) was refreshing but as a whole I think the different styles, that remind you of Shakira and the like, left me cold."
1,"Thalía = ""Copy Girl""","Thalía's New Cd is really boring, all songs sound equal. She is a cheaper copy by Mariah Carey, Paulina Rubio and Shakira. I don't like her ""Latin Beat"". Her last Cd shuold be titled ""Fracasando"", Her last 4 Cd's including this bores.In mexico everybody knows that she is a puppet of Mottola and the ""Estefan Group""..."
1,Songs are boring . Her english is poor!,"Big disappointment! !That song ""tu y yo"" is so boring!!Besides, is obvious that she is just trying to imitate Jlo, Britney Spears, Paulina Rubio and Shakira.I thought she was good, cause she got ""the look"" but she is not! I wouldn't buy this cd is not whorty!"
1,Unbelievable!,This has got to be the worst CD of the year. I can't believe Thalia would release such a horrible album. All her songs are stuck in the 80s. The music is so outdated. Save your money for something better. This CD is going directly to the trash.
5,Thalia never ceases to amaze me!,"I was so amazed by her previous 2 albums that I was doubting she'd ever top her own work but somehow she has managed to do it! The whole album is geniune work straight from Thalia's heart and I especially love her english songs (just a little taste of her much anticipated crossover) and the spanish song ""A QUIEN LE IMPORTA"" which is Thalia's way of giving the finger to all those people who still doubt her even though she has become the phenomenon she is today. I could go on and on but simply put and to summarize it up...THALIA is a must have!"
5,"GREAT ALBUM!, I think is one of her best albums!","I like very much this album! All the songs are good!I especially like ""Así es el destino"", ""The mexican 2002(Spanish version), ""Closer to you"", ""No me enseñaste"" and ""Tu y yo"".It's a good album.Buy it!"
1,What a waste of money,"I bought this CD based upon the great reviews, expecting to hear something along the lines of the new Latin pop performers, such as Shakira and Paulina. What a disappointment! Most of these songs sound like they're performed by a 12-year old. Were it not for the awesome collaborators--such as the Kumbia Kings & Marc Anthony--and the brilliant production work, Thalia would not be able to stand alone. On the other hand, I wonder why Dead or Alive sold the royalties to their work; I bet they regret it now that their formerly likeable tune has been butchered by some malnourished diva with a truncated voice and Tommy Mottola's millions (yes, Thalia is married to Mariah's ex). I rarely write reviews, but I am so disappointed with this one that I had to voice my frustration... Oh yes, I'm selling the used CD on the auctions section."
3,interesting,"I bought this for a friend, a young man who is dealing with serious kidney disease. He has been trained in acupuncture and observes healthy diet, etc. Although Dr. Sternberg's experience with improving her inflammatory conditions via positive environmental stimuli and good diet is inspiring, I don't think the remedy applies to my friend's very serious disease. He is probably already doing all the things Dr. S recommends, but all that will help him is a transplant. I didn't give the CD to him, as I thought is would just be suggesting that ""if you handled your disease better, you wouldn't be so sick."" And, that wouldn't make him feel any better."
2,Disappointed by 'Science of Healing',"If you're curious/intrigued by the premise of this video, I would recommend renting it over buying it. It is a VERY superficial overview of beliefs/practices which are thought to promote overall health & healing: Visual surroundings & environment can relieve stress. Pleasant smells can relieve stress & promote health. Regular exercise like walking promotes health. The Mediterranean dies is healthful. No kidding. Everybody knows this stuff and this video doesn't really offer up any new information or novel /interesting studies."
4,Good Solid Flick,"After spending five years in prison, Dr. Thomas Reed, played by the incomparable Vincent Ventresca, exiles himself to Purgatory Flats and winds up tending bar. He soon meets the luscious, angel-faced Sunny (Alexandra Holden). ""You are wicked."" he tells her. ""You have no idea."" she replies as she sips her Slo Comfortable Screw and languidly drags on her cig. Reed finds himself entwined in the violent troubles of her family and the femme fatale story unfolds set against the desolation and desperation of the oil-drained western town.Canny direction. Great performances. Superb entourage work. And some lust scenes that sizzle like the sun in Purgatory."
5,A under rated film,I watched this movie on Showtime a few weeks ago. It is a really good movie. It is not what you expect. The cinemaography (I know I spelt that wrong..lol) is really good. I like the story line. I think this is Brian Austin Greenes first film that seperates him from anything he has ever done. The story line is good.I know there will be people out there that may not like. Truly a matter of preference but I did enjoy it. I liked and I think if you are looking for something different. Give it a try.
4,Very pretty when hung in a window,"Pretty, reflects light and sparkles when hung in a sunny window. Makes a nice gift."
4,Prince & The NPG - Gett Off,I like this single with the extra mixes. If you are a Prince fan then it is a must have for your collection.
5,Sue Snue is wonderful!,"I, personally, enjoyed this book and so does my son and my niece. Children are always asked, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" How can you know when you are so young? Little ones, like the rest of us, are trying to figure out where they fit in the scheme of things. Does she want to be a baker, a candlestick maker, or something else? She says that she wants to be herself and I say 'Hooray!'. It's nice for girls and boys to know that it is more than fine to be themselves."
3,Fun read for you and your toddler together.,My son absolutely loves me to read about Ms. Susan Bock Dutter Docks Burklummer Snue. He loves all the different careers she can have and the chance at the end to say that she is going to be just who she is an no one else. I love the book because it makes my child laugh. At 2 he as memorized the entire book.
1,Terrible message!,"I completely agree with other reviewers who found the conclusion of the book (where the three-year-old Sue Snue defiantly announces to everyone that she will not be told what to do by any adult, including her parents) to be infuriating and entirely inappropriate. I ""edited"" the last pages of the book to remove the ridiculous rant."
3,The Frank Popp Ensemble - The Frank Popp Ensemble,"Where big beat meets big band funk: The Frank Popp Ensemble. These songs seem made for the jukebox -- short, catchy, energetic. Their retro chic is fully of shimmy and jiving, from the wild Hammond organ of ""Mullet King"" or the full-on soul horns on ""Breakaway."" And the pure fun of ""Hip Teens Don't Wear Blue Jeans"" is like a double-barrel of funk right in your face. It will make you shimmy, almost unconsciously, as well as reconsider your wardrobe. So what if tracks like ""Goo Goo Muck"" and ""The Catwalk"" don't really make much sense? If you want reasonable and thoughtful lyrics, go for the haunted house effects of the instrumental ""The Thing Demands"" or the liberation anthem ""Enough."" Better yet, just give into the fun."
5,Heavy Metal Parking Lot,"Seb Hunter does just a brilliant job paying Metal it's long due respect, concurrently embdedding just the right bit of wry Brittish humor and colloquialism, so that we don't take any of it too seriously. The important take-a-way, is that for anyone...I mean anyone who felt the goosebumps up their back when they first really FELT metal, those feelings and that energy and affectation were real. Anyone can make fun of it now, but if you were there, you know who you are and you will be underlining passages in nearly every page of this book. Without necessarily cognating it at the time, Metal was a first glimpse for many to grab onto something to really feel passionate about. And now, as an older, ""wiser"" person, I realize those experiences are just too hard to come by."
4,Excellent analysis of heavy metal.,"This book contains a very witty analysis of heavy metal culture, from its long hair, bullet belts, and tight jeans, to pointy headstocks on electric guitars and Marshall amps. Whether you are a fan of metal or not, you will find much to laugh at (or with).These observations on the metal scene are interspersed throughout what is actually a story about the author's ups and downs, on his quest to become a metal superstar. So while the commentary on the metal scene is more or less universal, the rest of this book is one man's journey.It doesn't necessarily detract much from the book, but it will probably be disappointing to anyone who reads it, that it is ultimately a story about how the author got out of the metal scene, and not a celebration of it."
5,Interesting Translation of Islam's Most Holy Book,"This translation is a good one to be read and compared to more traditional and literal translations, expecially for the non-Muslim reader. An interesting method and results. Certainly worth the purchase price, even though there are free versions available on the web."
2,Pretty poor game...,"I bought this when it first came out, and frankly, it was terrible. I never quite completed it, because I became so frustrated with the gameplay (a bad attempt to mix ""arcade action"" along with ""timed puzzles"" and ""text-based adventure game""). It was never fun, to begin with, and it was always frustrating. It's probably the worst game I've ever played. The translation into the English language was even done very poorly (I believe it was originally in French?).Trust me... it's the worst PC game I've ever played, and I have HUNDREDS of games I've purchased and played (some only part-way, some I've replayed multiple times)."
3,"More Scripting, less cleverness","With so few truly useful VRML books on the market, it is lclear that writers are at a premium. While this book was useful in putting the VRML phenomenon into perspective and allowing newbies a glimpse into its programming worth, it was a little shallow on actual content. It would have been nice to get some hardcore coding in while the business is still new. A mark could be made. Sadly, there are too many books of this quality. I recommend this one if you want to know more about where VRML is going, but not if you are a part of that direction."
5,The Real Thing,"I am a psychotherapist who found the EmWave while looking for a biofeedback product that would help my clients self regulate their moods. I can tell you that it is the real deal--it works just the way it says it will. Of course, like most things, it will only work for you if you follow the directions for use. The purpose of the EmWave is to bring your heart, brain and autonomic system into coherence, which then creates a feeling of well being. I have used it myself, as have my clients, and when used as directed it does work beautifully. You will also be interested to know that the research behind the creation of the EmWave is evidence based and sound."
5,A Macintosh version of the emWave program is finally available!!!,"A Macintosh version of this program is now available. There's a listing on Amazon, but the product isn't available here yet. More information is available at emwavemac dot com.Tom"
2,Who needs sound anyway?,"I bought the DVD with an eye toward using it in a forensic evidence class. Unfortunately, the sound on the video is dismal. The doctor mumbles and the other pathologists look like deer in headlights. You would think there might be more than one choice for a topic as educational as an autopsy.The reviewer who mentioned lack of context is exactly right. No history was provided, and to come to closure on the actual c/o/d was no small accomplishment either."
1,Don't bother,"This DVD seemed like it was filmed cheaply and made in a basement (creepy thought.) It was very dark, and well, just not educational. It didn't seem professional or medical. I have gotten more out of Dr. G, Medical Examiner on TV. Don't bother to buy this. There are better ways to learn about an autopsy."
4,Creepy.,"I enjoyed the writing style, poetic and eerie. But the overall creepiness kinda got to me. I knew what I would get going into this, but I couldn't read the whole thing myself, just the first story. I would, however recommenced the book if for no other reason to push your boundaries."
3,"Disturbing, but potentially dated","""House of Sleeping Beauties,"" and the other short stories in this collection, all deal with the themes of idolization of virginity, degradation, fetishization of the body, and so forth. While this may be food for thought for early and even late 20th century readers, the 21st century reader might not get as much out of it. As with many modern Japanese works, Yasunari Kawabata transcends any cultural barriers by focusing on things that are alien in any settings, and themes that are universal to anyone who has ever struggled with any sort of ""hang up"" about [anatomy]."
4,CHAMBERLAIN GARAGE DOOR OPENER,"AN EASY INSTALLATION, JUST FOLLOW THE WRITTEN DIRECTIONS. IT WAS A REPLACEMENT AND I WAS ABLE TO RE-USE MOST OF THE EXISTING LIGHT ANGLE IRON MOUNTING BRACKETS. DOOR SENSORS WERE EASY TO INSTALL AND LINE UP. AFTER INSTALLATION, IT WAS REAL SIMPLE TO MAKE ALL THE FINAL ADJUSTMENT.MY OLD OPENER WAS A CHAIN DRIVEN AND VERY NOISY. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND IMPRESSED WITH THE QUITE OPERATION OF A SCREW TYPE."
5,"Good manual for the ""Do-It-Yourself"". Smooth Operation.","The screw driven opener performs very well. Operation is quiet and smooth. The computer's logic and sensors ensures the opener will avoid ""crushing"" incidents. The lightweight rail is easy to assemble and stronger then expected. I used Locktite medium strength to ensure nuts would not vibrate off. The lack of vibration made the Locktite superfluous.The manual was clearly written. Providing the installation steps are followed, the system is easy to install in a half a day. Please make sure your door is balanced as explained in the manual. You do need a 6 ft. ""A"" frame ladder. Manuals can be previewed (to see if you want to tackle this job) and additional accessories are available at Chamberlain's own web site.Amazon's competitive pricing and inexpensive shipping made the purchase easy."
5,Does the job,"I opted for this garage door opener for two reasons, the price and it's a screw drive. I initially purchase one to replace a really old opener that was failing. Because I was pleased with the installation process and its performance, the decided to purchase a second model. I've had them both for 3 months and no issues thus far."
2,this watch needs a new battery!,Actually this is a very nice watch -- unfortunately - it didn't work and I had to return it.
4,Show nuff!!!,Uncle Luke is one of the best of his time...Minus the controversy he's a brilliant business and he loves the black community... Worth the money? 4sho!!!
1,mother of 1 year old and pg needing monitors.,"Despise all the reviews and after talking to the sales associates at BRU. We purchased this monitor over the summer dual monitor. We have only had it for 12 hours and already the monitor is not working. I moved the monitor right out side my daughters door and it still doesnt work. It only worked for about 10 mins and then hasnt worked since. Yes there is a hum and if you dont mind it or dont have senitive hearing, its fine. It drove me nuts. If you want to try it, cause yes some homes get better reception, but buy it locally and hang on to your box and your receipts. As most of the reviews state, it goes bad months later, so make sure you can return it locally so your not out shipping cost. Just be aware when you purchase this monitor and hang onto everything. We are out to do more research for another monitor. We are looking at X-10 cause so far they have had the best quality."
2,Not worth the money,"Got this as a gift at my baby shower. Video reception is very poor and the transmission distance is quite short. Our home is 70 ft long and the video transmission cannot make it that far. The audio transmission is good so that is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Overall, regrettable product."
2,Probably not worth it,"For the price, I would have expected better performance. Lucky for us it was a gift. The audio performs passably, although I found the maximum volume, on the video monitor at least, was too quiet. The video signal never worked reliably when the units were upstairs & downstairs, respectively. The interference from the cordless telephone, however, was unbearable. With just two channels to choose from, it was impossible to clear up even after trying all the channels on the cordless phone. I am much more satisfied with the Sony Baby Call 900 MHz 27-channel monitor (audio only though), in all respects."
4,Worth it!,"We received this as a gift, and even it is hard to get a good reception sometimes, it is the best video monitor we found. We bought about 3 others to try, and they weren't as good as this one. I like how you can turn down the volume on it, b ut you never turn it off. So even if you can't hear your baby, you'll see the lights on the monitor light up. Worth the money!"
2,Again- Night Sensor Dies within a month or two!,"Like many others who have written, we had received the previous model (with the TV- a feature I liked) but after the infrared sensors died we returned it to Safety First, who replaced it with this newer model. While the reception & quality is still fine during the day, the night vision died again after only 2 months and now I cannot see my daughter in the dark. Whoever was told by customer service that the infrared sensors are ""not supposed to be lit up"" was told a crock of lies! As soon as those go out, you will notice that you can no longer see in the dark. This appears to be a chronic problem with this product, so don't waste your money. I saw that GE makes a similar video monitor, maybe that is better since they are a trusted name in electronics."
1,Never worked right,"If this had not been a gift without a gift receipt we would have taken it back after the first day. The video monitor had *severe* vertical hold issues and would not stop rolling. Very entertaining for the cats, not so much for us, especially at night. Both the audio and video had terrible interference issues. Maybe it was our Wi-Fi, maybe it was sunspots. Either way both would hiss at random intervals, completely obscuring the signal, even if the receiver was right next to the optical device. Last night, it just stopped working. Nothing but hiss, no matter what channel it was on. If the video monitor wasn't a tube-TV I'd take a hammer to it. If it was possible to give zero stars, I would."
2,Monitor doesn't last long,We loved this monitor until a little over a year after we started using it (of course after warranty expired). The picture got increasingly worse and smaller so that now (two years later)it is a 1/4 inch strip across the monitor. We can only use it for sound now. We are definately purchasing a different brand for the next baby.
2,Picture is horrible at night,I bought this video monitor for the night vision. But I can only get a good picture when the light is on. At night half the screen looks like fog. It hurts my eyes to look at the screen and I can't even see my child on the monitor. The monitor works fine for daytime but if you want to see your child in the dark this monitor is a waste of money.
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible!!!,"We purchased this monitor so that we would have the piece of mind to see our newborn son sleep without having to go into his room to check on him. Even though the phones and different household items would sometimes make it go crazy, it was still so handy to have - until I used it for about 2 months! One night as I was getting ready for bed I noticed that there was no picture on the monitor! The thing just wouldn't work! We could get sound but couldn't see a thing in his room at night when it was dark! I tried it the next morning and it worked fine. I left it on all day this time, but when it got dark out the monitor wouldn't pick up any picture again! This is totally useless to me if I can't see him at night when I would need it the most! I have looked all over for a way to get it fixed or talk to the company and can't find anything! I guess I am just stuck with an extremely expensive monitor that only picks up sound! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
2,loved it...till it broke and they wanted $100 to repair it,"We got this as a babyshower gift. I loved the idea, but in the begining, who needs a video to watch a swaddled infant?? LOL. At around 5 months, I began using the night vision. At 8 months of on and off use, the night vision broke. I finally got around to calling the company 13 months after the unit was purchased...mind you I got it at a baby shower... they offered to send me a replacement camera for $99...now why would I purchase a replacement for $100, when I can get a whole new unit for $150??? So, we no longer have night vision. Instead I put it in my home office for watching my child while I work. I guess if it didnt break in such a short time, I would reccomend...but for $150, it definelty should have lasted longer than a year.. in my opinion. So, yes it is a good monitor initially, yes it has decent clarity of picture, and yes, I loved it at first, but save yourself money and go for another option..."
2,Went down hill. . . .,"The picture/reception was never good, and finally the parent reciever (sound only) broke. Also, their so called ""night vision"" was awful.I had purchased the product reimbursement plan, and I am SOOOO glad I did. Definitely NOT WORTH THE PRICE!"
1,The Worst Monitor Out There,"My daughter who is 9 months old, this is her fifth monitor. We received it as a gift for my baby shower. It worked great until the monitor went bad. Then we purchased another because we liked the fact that we can see her. The monitor went bad again. This last model something in the camera part went bad. We could only see her during the day. Well, needless to say we are now done with this monitor. It was great to see her but not worth the money."
2,Good while it works,"I've had this brand and model of monitor for 10 months now. My second one just went bad again. I had the first one for about 4 months when the night vision went out and I couldn't see anything at night. I returned it for another and now this one is doing the same thing about 6 months later. It hasn't even been a year since I started buying these! I'm going to see if the store will take it back. If it will, I'm buying the other greenish colored one. I'm not going to mess with this one anymore."
3,Great for the first 6 months :(,"As a first time mom, this was great in the beginning. I felt relieved knowing that I could quickly glance at my baby during the night and decide if I needed to go into his room or not. It's VERY sensitive to sound - I hear all of his movements, which can be great, and horrible, if you are a light sleeper! Picture is wonderful (except when the 900mhz phone rings). BUT a problem developed after 6 months - the night vision LED's are not working. I can see him during the day in lighter hours, but at night I can't see him at all. The sound still works. I am going to contact the manufacturer tomorrow. I read another review just like this...sounds like it might be a manufacturer defect."
4,NERVOUS MOMS MUST-HAVE,"Even though we share a room with my almost 7-month old, we would be lost without this monitor. Babies make alot of noise when they sleep. With this monitor, you can see if she's simply just making noise or if you need to attend to her. We traveled to Maine to a house party for my brother-in-law's birthday. There were alot of people there that we did not know. I would not of been able to relax after she went to a different floor to sleep without my TV next to me verifying that she was safe and sound. I read the other reviews, it is true that the cordless phone makes you loose the picture. I found that that only happens if the phone is in the same room as the TV, and you still have sound. That is why I voted 4 stars instead of 5. That is the ONLY FLAW. Nightime vision is excellent. Picture is perfect! If this monitor broke today, I would feel that I got my money's worth and would run out to buy another."
2,not great but adequate,"There must be something better. Like everyone else (this should be a clue for new purchases!), this is a factory replacement (900M) for the original monitor (2.4G) we purchased where the camera failed (infrared again). The replacement picture is nominal at best in infrared. The reception is awful at more than a few feet. Many other devices interfere. The portable sound monitor is a nice addition, but it eats AAA batteries (four at a time) with a passion. Purchase something else when it becomes available. Don't risk it... the one's who love it haven't had a failure yet."
4,Works great for us,"There were alot of bad reviews for this monitor which made me nervous at first since I knew I had gotten this one on my gift registry... but it has always worked very well for us. I gave it four starts simply because one time I turned it on and it had waves on the screen, but the next time it didn't... must've been interference from somewhere. It is quite expensive, but we have been very satisfied with this model."
1,"Bad product, bad customer service","We received this monitor as a shower gift and have only had problems from the beginning. The sound feature broke on my first one (although in all subsequent ones it was still awful, and you can barely hear your baby)only a few months after received it. I contacted Safety 1st and they sent me a new one, then a few months later the night vision feature broke, and since the product was still under warantee, they sent me another one. Now my 3rd montior has broken (the night vision feature again) and Safety 1st told me they no longer make this model, and it is no longer under warantee (short by 3 months) so I have to purchase a new one. When I told them that based on their track record I was considering another brand, they said ""fine"". I can't believe a Company wouldn't want to do more for a customer when clearly they are selling an inferior product. I do not recommend anyone buying this product, it will cause you more hassles than its worth."
3,Decent product but expensive,"After we used this monitor for about three weeks, the infrared night vision went out on the system. I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement with little problem. My new monitor gives me feedback if I turn it up too loud which the other one didn't do, but I just have to remember to keep it down.The handheld receiver works excellent. I can take it downstairs or outside and the reception is awesome! Which says a lot considering we have cordless phones, cell phones, and a wireless Network that doesn't seem to interfere at all.Overall, I LOVE the product ( overly helpful 6 yr old and baby share a room), but based off of my own experience and the reviews of others, there does appear to be a defect (worthy of a recall in my opinion) with the night vision part. If that were remedied, I would give this product five stars."
2,Liked it until night vision broke after 6 months,"I was happy with this unit until the night vision completely lost function after only a few months. We cannot see any detail at all in the dark, which is 99% of the time the monitor is needed. I just contacted the company by e-mail, and now I see online that many people have had this same problem. For the amount of money this unit cost, I expected better quality."
2,"Good for a while, but...","I purchased this monitor for my first child, and had pretty good reception with it. Unfortunately it did not last until I had my second child. It only lasted about a year and a half. At that time I decided that I needed a new monitor for my first child and that I was going to need a second one for the baby. I read a review at the time on this website which recommended the radio shack monitor. It allows add on cameras to be in multiple rooms at once so that both children can be monitored. You can program it to be on one, or both. It stays 4 or 6 seconds (your choice) one one camera, and then switches to the other room. It is a little bit more expensive but definately worth it in my opinion."
1,Poor quality product and customer service,"Initially the monitor worked well and then the video portion stopped working. No picture at all. Contacted Safety 1st got the run around for a week and then said it needed to be replaced and that the only way they would do that was to send in the entire system. So now I am without any monitoring system after spending the money for what was supposed to be the best. Bottom line poor quality, unreliable backed up by the worst customer service policy I have ever seen."
1,No reception... very sensitive item...do not buy,We got this as a baby gift and had so much trouble setting it up. We could not get good reception from any room in our house! The momentary reception we were getting was so poor you couldn't make out details....Do NOT waste your $150...We haven't tried any of the other video sets yet but I'm reluctant to after the extreme dissapointment we had with this one.....
1,POOR POOR POOR QUALITY!,"I first purchased the 2.4GHZ last June. It lasted three months and was completely out without warning. The company is very cooperative and asks no questions. You have the choice to have them send a new monitor or a complete refund. Second monitor, went out in about 3 1/2 months and sent this one back. I purchased the third one on January 7 and it is now out. The company has pulled these off of the shelf because they were no good and replaced them with this model. I drove to the nearest toys r us today which is 40 miles and this is a horrible model. Their is barely a picture of the baby. This one will now be returned. I rate this very poorly, although keep in mind the company is awesome and will never give you any problems with returns or refunds."
1,DOESN'T WORK AT NIGHT!!!,"I HAD THE OLDER VERSION WITH THE TV AND WE EXCHANGED IT ABOUT 6-7 TIMES BECAUSE THE PICTURE KEPT GOING. I ONLY DID THIS BECAUSE OUR 1ST SON WAS THE SPIT UP KING, SO WE DEALT WITH THE HASSLES. FOR MY 2ND SON, I SAW THIS NEW VERSION AND THOUGHT-GREAT A NEW AND IMPROVED MODEL. WELL, I GUESS IT'S NEW AND IMPROVED...BUT THAT STILL SAYS VERY LITTLE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THROUGH THE SNOWY PICTURE AT NIGHT. WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY THEY HAD ME UNPLUG AND REPLUG EVERYTHING BACK IN MY HOUSE. THEN I MOVED IT CLOSER....NOTHING WORKED. I AM TAKING THIS BACK TOMORROW. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Frustrated consumer,"I have to say in the beginning I thought this product was great, I could see the baby and know whether I had to go in or if she was just playing. It has only been a year and the video monitor screen has died on us, I only can see a blur, so we just use if or sound. When I contacted the manufacturer, I was told I could buy the screen for 107.00 which is still not a bargin, and they were not helpful on the phone at all. I do not recomment this product to you if you want to use it for the long term. I only hope in the future they will develope their technology a lot better to make it last, but on the other hand how can they make money if that happens!!!"
1,Not Good,"The volume wouldn't work on the TV monitor (brand new) then I found that when I moved it in the right position the sound would come through. The picture was O.K. you can see at night but it had a tube effect, darkening around the image, as long as the image was dead center. The hand held receiver was really bad. I was shocked to find that it was so unclear. I found that a cheap monitor that I got as a promo the,(900 Mhz Long Range Monitor) had a much clearer sound.I could hear my daughter breathing, and never second guessed what she was doing in her crib."
2,Not quite right,"I registered and received this monitor as a shower gift. I thought it would be great. My daughter is 10 months now and I have already bought another monitor. Within the first month of use the hand-held audio only monitor broke. The video actually works really well and aside for some NOISY interference that it picks up sometimes, its a great picture day or night. The camera is kind of a pain, though. The way that it is angled, you need to mount it on the wall above the crib, or have it sitting on a tall piece of funiture that can overlook the crib. I don't have that, so we only really use it for the sound. The monitor is very large, though, and so it would have been nice if the hand held auido one worked - so I could take it to another room. This model has too many problems I wouldn't buy it if I could do it over again."
2,Great until you use your phone......,"Video was good and appeared to be worth the price. Unfortunately, it has limited channels (only 2) and they just don't offer enough flexibility to deal with any other 900 MHz systems. Not only does it creates static on my cordless phone but when the phone is in use, the video signal goes completely out. So alas, back to the store this goes...If you only have 2.4 GHz systems in use at your house, this one will probably work for you."
1,Nice look but terrible quality.,We bought this and had trouble from the start with the reception and the night vision. The reception was never stable therefore difficult to watch. The night vision is just weak compared to the Summer model which we ended up getting. And finally the tube blew out after less than a year of sitting boxed up in a closet. Complete waste of money.
1,Company does not back up this item,I have owned this product for a year and half and now the video monitor went out on it. I took it to Babies r us and they said they have a 90 day return or exchange policy now without receipt or box and they said to contact Safety 1st. I called Safety 1st and they said it only has a one year warranty. I find this absolutely horrible for a company to only warranty this product for one year when obliviously so many others have had similar problems. I will not buy Safety 1st products again.
1,VERY Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had originally bought the Safety 1st 2.4GHz Child view monitor back in 2002 when my daughter was born. It was a VERY reliable product-- day OR night the picture was great. So when the wire frayed to the monitor, I did not hesitate to purchase another safety 1st video monitor. I bought the 900Mhz sight and sound assurance and IT IS AWFUL!!!!! The picture is wavy and fuzzy during the day and I do not get ANY picture at night!!!! And if my phone rings, I get NOTHING BUT SNOW!!!! I am VERY VERY disappointed and will be returning it to the store ASAP! I am not sure why this model is so inferior to the old one, but its clear that Safety 1st needs to rethink this one!!!!!"
1,Run for your Life!,Do Not Waste Your Money on this product!!!! I have bought two of these monitors in a period of 2 and 1/2 years. The product is set up to work just as long as the one year warranty and then a couple months after the warranty is out so is your monitor. This can get expensive if you're buying a monitor every year. I reccomend finding a monitor that is a lot more reliable.
5,Peace of mind... simply could not sleep :) without,If you are considering a monitor... pay extra for a VIDEO monitor.The picture is clear and can be adjusted to be lighter or darker for those of us that like a darker room to sleep in. I simply could not of gotten any sleep as a first time mother had I not been able to see my son peacefully sleeping in his crib every time I opened my eyes at night.We use both the video monitor and the separate hand held monitor all the time and have had no problems that could not be adjusted easily.Forget getting up all night long to check on your angel and buy a VIDEO monitor instead.
3,"Good, but not great.","I like this monitor overall, but it needs some improvements.I like that I can keep this next to my bed with the video turned off so I can sleep. When I hear him start fussing I just flip on the video to see what he's up to. The picture is hit or miss though. It needs a stronger antenna or something - it's fuzzy a lot of the time but when I put my hand near it the picture gets better. The sound is good on the monitor and I also like the light meter that lets me know how loud the sound is.The power button is large and right on top of the unit... like a snooze button. I've actually hit the power button in the morning instead of my snooze alarm and shut the monitor off. It would be nice if there was a power indicator light so I would know when I do this! Sometimes he's so quiet I wonder if it's still on.Having AC adapters is nice; I like the picture I get even at night; lights, picture, and sound make it very easy to know what my son is doing."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The monitor worked for about one month, then the infrared system stopped working. A few months later, the audio system stopped working. Of all the baby gear I have (and I have a lot), this is by far the worst item we own. Don't waste your money."
5,Absolutely worth the money!,"We bought this monitor based off the employees comments on it and the disapproving opinions of the other video monitors. This was the best purchase we made for our son. We can see and hear him perfectly clear all the time. The best part is you can turn off the monitor so you can just see him, just hear him, or hear and see him. The other adaptor works wonderful when roaming through the house or doing yard work when our son is sleeping. I would advise this product to anyone who is looking for the video monitors!"
2,Unhappy with product,My husband and I had two of these monitors. Both video screens stopped working after about 6 weeks. The picture was also often fuzzy and didn't work in certain areas of our house. The only thing that we did like was that it came with the extra monitor so we could be in two different areas in the house and both hear our daughter.
1,"So so video, goof audio and no night vision","The video monitor is like watching a tv from the 70's - it is black and white with alot of 'snow' noise and horizontal bars constantly. Also, the night vision does not appear to be working and after reading some of the other reviews here, it seems this is not a well built quality item and the night vision seems to have problems elsewhere.Good luck with your purchase! Hopefully it goes better for you."
2,more money then it's worth,"Even thoough, I like seeing our newborn, it is not worth the money. We have nothing but problems, every night I put the monitor on and it is either fuzzy or the pictue keeps flipping over and over. I think the idea is great, however if they are going to charge so much for it, they need to come up with something better."
2,Don't waste your money,"I thought that this was going to be a great device, but I was wrong. I ordered this item the beginning of November in 2004 and did not get it out of the box and use it until the following January and it started off being the greatest and coolest thing I had. Then after the second night of using the sound monitor it just quit producing any sound. I didn't really sweat it because you can hear sound through the t.v.. The nabout two months later of just using the t.v. at noght and no other time during the day the t.v. just quits working. I get just a blank bright screen. I did notice that when using my cell phone around the t.v. that it would make the screen jump and get blurry so I kept the phone away from the t.v. so that couldn't have played a role. I wish I had known that I was going to be throwing this much money away because I could have used it on something else for my first child."
2,Be Warned!,"I just got off of the phone with Safety 1st moments ago. I have this baby monitor and was pretty happy with it for the first year or so. The warranty is only good for one year and now I know why. We were very careful with this monitor and after 2 years, the picture is horrible. There is a huge bar running right across the image so you can't see anything at all. I called the company and they informed me that if it is past 1.5 years, I am out of luck. They even claimed that they no longer have the monitor part in stock. I am now completely unsatisfied with this product and with Safety 1st in general. They will not stand by their product when it becomes defective and it's as if the part was programmed to stop working when the warranty is up. Don't make the same mistake that I did, this is an expensive product and not worth the money if you can't hand it down or sell to someone else when you are done with it."
1,Do not buy,"We loved this monitor for 7 months. At exactly 7 months of usage the screen went blank. I am very disappointed because we have another Safety 1st video monitor that was purchased in 2000 and it is still working well (it does experience a lot of interference with the cordless phone and the microwave, however). After reading reviews on Amazon and several other web sites it is apparent that this is not an isolated issue. There is a manufacturing or design problem with this model. Please do not spend your money on this model until Safey 1st resolves this issue!"
4,Got lucky with our monitor,"I was shocked how bad some of the reviews were on this product. I was ordering one for someone's shower gift when I saw them. I have had this monitor for 2 1/2 yrs and have used it everyday during this time. It is still working. The sound is starting to flick in and out on the video monitor. We have occassional problems with resception but nothing a little maneuvering cannot fix. Our daughter's room is now upstairs and across the house (4300 sq feet house) and we get great reception. I use this monitor now even more than when she was a baby b/c she is in a twin bed and I need to see what she is up to, ie staying in bed and lying down. I also loved it when she was in the crib so once she was in bed I would never go back in to check on her until I knew she was asleep. It is harder to see at night but you can see movement just fine. I am thankful we have it and that mine has lasted so long."
2,Worked a little over a year,I used this monitor and thought it worked great. Then a little over a hear the screen died out on me. I could only get sound. For this price it should last longer!
1,Gave up after the 2nd one died,"We really enjoyed this product while it was working. On the first one we bought, the sound on the monitor unit quit working after the 2nd day. So we exchanged it for a second unit, which worked fine for a few days. Then the monitor unit wouldn't turn on. So we are taking it back to exchange for a different brand. I can't believe how poorly this product is made taken into account how basic the technology used in this product, especially considering the price. Never again."
3,The old model is much better,"We had the older model (purchased 3 years ago), and the night vision picture was perfect. It lasted through 3 years of constant use and occasional abuse (it was knocked off the table at least a dozen times). This new model has a perfect picture when the nursery is bright, but turn off the lights and the picture becomes hazy and unclear. It looks like the room is filled with smoke. The reception is fairly reliable, though. Our wireless internet is 2.4GHz and our cordless phone is 900MHz, and there doesn't seem to be any interference from either device. The microwave doesn't even disturb the picture much.We had planned to mount the camera on the wall, high up in a corner so we could view most of the 12' x 12' room, but the camera angle is too narrow. It's fine for viewing the crib itself, but that's it.We are considering returning this monitor and trying the Summer monitor instead."
2,Night Vision broke at 6 months!!!,"I loved this monitor, very happy with it until suddenly I oculdn't see my son at night anymore. I didn't know what was wrong, I thought there was a bad reception for some reason because we were on a trip, but as it turns out the night vision is broken. I called Safety 1st and they are giving me a replacement camera free of charge, but it is back ordered for three to six weeks!"
2,SHORT LIVED HAPPINESS,"We got this as a shower gift and been using it since our daughter was born (May). We loved the fact that we can see our daughter and not to have run in at every peep. But with each month the picture quality has gotten worse and it seems like its got a life of its own. Its fuzzy, its clear, then it gets staticy. And then it fixes itself! And no matter how you adjust the knob in the back, it won't work. We should have kept the box. :("
1,GOOD PRODUCT..FOR A LITTLE WHILE,"I bought this monitor in march and I loved it. The picture was a little fuzzy sometimes but nothing unbearable. All of a sudden, the picture won't work at all. If it is light outside or the bedroom light is on then I can see my daughter if not it is just black. The additional sound only monitor eats batteries like crazy and now doesn't even work at all. For the amount of money I paid for this product, it certainly didn't deliver."
1,Cannot Use This at Night,"Called Safety 1st when we realized that the ""night vision LEDs"" weren't lighting up and therefore you can't see a thing at night on the video. They said the camera has to be within 6 ft and there has to be enough light around it & the baby. And even more astonishing thing is the fact that those LEDs ""are not supposed to actually light up"". There is something wrong with this picture..."
1,Bad reception,I returned the Summer Video monitor and bought this one. I have a 1500 square foot home and the video monitor would not work because it was out of range. It was terrible. My house it not that big and I was shocked to find out that the video screen has to be close to the base. I would not recommend this monitor.
3,Great while it lasts.......,"I loved having this monitor. I was such a worrywart with my first child and constantly went to his room while he was sleeping. This monitor was so helpful in preventing my nightly trips to the nursery for my 2nd child. It worked wonderfully for about 6 months. Then the picture got worse and worse until the monitor slowly went out altogether. I called Safety 1st and they were very great about replacing the monitor. However, I missed my daughter roll over in her sleep for the first time while I waited on the replacement. And about 8 months later, the new monitor started going downhill. It started flickering constantly to the point that it disturbed my sleep. There was always an occasional flick which was fine. But slowly the flickering increased and the picture got worse and worse until I finally just turned it off. It's hard to get used to being without it after you have it and while it works it's great. It's just not made for long term I guess."
1,Don't Buy!!!,"Used unit for 1 month, the night vision broke. Had camera replaced. Replaced camera had a crackle in microphone. Had to send back both cameras for a whole new system, was without a monitor for a month! We opened the box to check out the new system, plugged in the video monitor, guess what, no screen, just a flat line through the middle, I guess the picture tube was busted. Thats ok, we still have the video monitor from the old system. Everything works ok now, but the reception sucks, the monitor is no more than 20 feet away from the camera and we have to use a clothes hanger to get a decent picture. We got this as a baby shower gift. I would never spend my money on this product."
2,Stop!!!! Buy a Different Monitor!,I own the older version of this product for 2-1/2 years and now the video camera went out on it. I called Safety 1st and they said it only has a one year warranty. They no longer make this model and there was nothing they could do for me to fix the problem. (How about having back up stock for a little while!) I find this absolutely horrible for a company to only warranty this type product for one year when obliviously so many others have had similar problems. I will not buy another Safety 1st product. I told customer service if I could help it they will not make another dime off of my family or friends who have children. This could very well happen to you in a year or two!!!!!!BEWARE!!!!
3,Not the best,"I bought this monitor after having the Summer monitor for a year. I wasn't getting great reception from my Summer so I decided to try a new brand. I had the same problem with the reception. Also, I found the switch to turn the screen on and off AND the volume controls a little difficult to maneuver (especially at 3 am in the dark!!!). The Summer has a large glowing button on top that is easy to find even when you are seeing double at 3 am. The unit was also larger than the Summer and ate up a majority of my night stand.Needless to say, I returned it and bought another Summer (and unplugged my cordless - which helps also)"
3,Loved it...then it broke!,"Like many other reviews listed, I too loved being able to watch and hear my daughter while she slept. The night vision was great until the darned thing stopped working. At first it just flickered from time to time, then the video portion stopped working altogether. My husband and I would have to stand there for sometimes 10 mins switching channels and messing with it to get a picture. Then it would go off again, then on again, just a headache. For $150 bucks you think it would last more than a few months. What a disappointment."
1,This Monitor Is Not Worth It,"I have read a lot of reviews and have to tell you that those that have only been using this monitor for less than 1 year are unaware that is about how long it will last. I was given this monitor at my shower in June 2003. By January 2004, the video had stopped working. However, Safety 1st did replace it. I happened to save the box but we needed to send it to them first before they sent the replacement. Then, sometime in November/Deceber 2004, the video monitor went again. Again, Safety 1st replaced it because it was within the one year warranty. However, since early December 2005, our video monitor is slowly going and it is only a matter of time before it stops working. I now have a 5 month old and my husband and I are looking for another model since, Safety 1st will now not replace it. I wouldn't buy it."
2,Major disappointment!!!!,"This was a great monitor until it stopped working after only 3 months of use! The night vision is terrible and the unit would scramble on us if the phone rang or the microwave is on. It was very hard to angle/position of the base and there is no zoom in our out. Oh, the pictures come in black and white. What happen to color??? I suggest you buy something else"
2,Great while it last,"We have had this monitor since my daughter was born. Now she is 19 months and the screen part doesn't work, at all. We called the company and wouldn't you know just out of warranty, so I guess we are stuck with it. My sister-in-law has the same one, and is having the same problems. (Her son is only 14 months old)"
2,Better options available,"I will be returning this product. The Day and Night monitor by Summer Infant works much better. Although the Safety 1st monitor has 900 Mhz technology, we experienced interference from our 2.4 Mhz phone. The interference caused the screen to blink, fuzz up and roll. We had the screen in the kitchen and were also unable to watch the baby on the screen when we ran the microwave and/or washing machine due to interference. Worst of all, the baby's papasan swing at the detector camera also caused similar interference. The camera does not move up and down for viewing the baby as does the one by Summer Infant. If you are concerned about SIDS, you can't see slight breathing motions on the screen anyway. If that is why you are buying this item, don't. We bought the Angelcare motion detector/sensor for that, and it works great!"
2,Poor reception on the monitor.,"It is almost impossible to see our baby with this monitor. A friend described it best when she said she felt she was looking at an ultrasound image. It is hard to tell where the baby is and we have to play with the antenna a lot to get some reception. However, the sound quality is good and there is no interference. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Not worth the money,"I gave it 2 stars because this video monitor worked wonderfully for us - when it worked. I have had 5 of these monitors and the longest any of them has lasted is one year. The sound has always stopped working for one reason or another on the monitor. The reason I have had so many is simple: the first time it broke, it was our fault. So we had the extra camera so we figured why not buy another one and we can have 2 camera's that way we can switch which side of the crib we wanted to view based on where the baby had moved to. But then the next 4 monitors broke so I just kept returning them. Once I did try another brand, but that one didn't even work AT ALL once I brought it home, so I had to treck back up to Babies R Us to return it. My suggestion is to try another one out there that's on the market."
2,Good functionality but poor quality,"We purchased this monitor and enjoyed it's features until the camera stopped working. We exchanged it now the V-hold on the video monitor is completely out of control, rendering the video useless. In 15 months we've had two product failures. Good features, poor quality."
1,Very Disappointed,"I received this monitor as a gift from my baby registry. I was very excited to use it for the first time...that's about the only time it worked. The tv screen monitor completely died after just 3 days of use. The small sound monitor continued to work. I notified the company and they sent me a brand new system at no charge. That new monitor worked for one night, then the picture quit working but the sound still works on the tv monitor. We notifed the company and they said they would send a new tv monitor which we have yet to receive. Also, this monitor picks up A LOT of static interference so you can't turn up the volume very loud most of the time. I think this monitor is a huge waste of money and I am currently shopping for a new one."
2,I could do as well with m y camcorder,"The quality of this video is definitely not at the same level as many other children's videos. The video is quite repetitive and not very creative at all. The first part of the video is simply a recitation of the alphabet with computer generated graphics. This is repeated once and then there is a section of the video where words are mentioned that go with each letter. I don't find the images to be particularly eye catching. I speak Spanish and English fluently and am always looking for tools to help me teach my daughter Spanish. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Bilingual Baby video. It is simple, but very well done and my 19 m.o. daughter asks to see it frequently."
5,The Masters of Deception,"Great book going behind the scenes of computer hackers in teh late 80's early 90's. It really takes you back to the time. Not overly complex. A fantastic read for anyone with an interest in computer crime or within the ""IT"" community. Easy enough to read for someone not technicle savy to understand the basics. For $10 USD you cant go wrong."
4,Another glimpse into the underground,"If you want a book to teach you about hacking, and the technical information surrounding hacking, this is not your book. If you are looking for a glimpse into hacker culture, and discover what people can do with a little curiousity in this modern wired world, definately read this book. As some of the other reviewers have said, this book is a little fluffy, and the authors seem to attempt to make the book read like a cheesy TV show. If you can look past the writing style you will find an interesting plot with many twists and turns through the phone company, the Secret Service and the legal system."
5,great book,"someone finally wrote a book that shows what and how hacking is/evolved. i read this book in a few days and was really upset when i was done. i was also excited that someone finally wrote a book about the Masters of Deception. i was a little kid when all this happened, and i'm still not that old, but i remember hearing about it on BBSes and everywhere else hackers where. this is a good book, get it. -Siber_Killer"
5,It kicked.,Masters of Deception is an extremely well written book. It treats the hacker community with a lot of respect. 10. That's it!
2,Not worth the read,"I am a fan of this genre of books. This book is the most boring account I've read. Instead of a pleasure, it was tedious to read."
4,Enjoyable insight into thinking and methods of hacker type.,"The book provides an idea of the reasons for the thinking ofthe people that do this sort of hacking. After reading it,I can't help but wonder how far some of these people couldhave gone in the ""real"" world if they had put as much workinto legitimate activities. It also proves the point thatthere is not as much genius involved as headlines would haveus believe, but instead there is a lot of hard work andpossiby some luck involved.I would be interested in reading a book, five years from now,telling what has happened to many of the characters."
3,oh please,"The cover begins by cooing ""Oh, is this ever a good book!"" Nope, it isn't.It doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Levy's ""Hackers"" or Stoll's ""Cuckoo's Nest"".I'm sorry I didn't wait for it to turn up in the bargain rack."
3,Skip this one,"If you want a book on computer cracking that you can't put down, that will keep you up past your bedtime -- then skip this one and get The Cuckoo's Egg by Cliff Stoll. Factual and detailed. The Masters of Deception is more a feelgood fuzzy kind of sociological study, light on facts and correlations. Not one to read a second time."
4,One of the best...,"Great book on an interesting hacker case. Particularly interesting details about Barlow and the EFF. Did a good job of explaining technical nuances for the uninitiated. All in all, a fun and relevant book to read.FREE KEVIN!"
2,Painful to read: cliched and factually wrong,"I read this after reading Clifford Stoll's Cuckoo's Egg which is a much better book on the same subject matter. Stoll is just a smart and observant graduate student who simply tries to tell his story accurately. The 2 authors of Masters of Deception are apparently professional writers and they spend too much time trying to liven up what is essentially an account of high school and college kids playing on computers. You get the feeling they writing this with a screenplay in mind. The book is filled with cliches, bad metaphors, contrived rhetorical questions: ""Destroy people's lives? Make them look like saints? Is this what hackers do?"" There is very little interesting technical info and much of what there is is dumbed down and often wrong. The discussion of tymnet in chapter 13 is completely off. They obviously don't understand it. Cuckoo's Egg is much better and even the Littman books are better books on the same topic."
5,This is the best book,"If you have ever walked into a computer store and you see a bunch of kids hanging around talking it's likely you have no idea what they are saying because they are using terminology that many don't know. This book teaches you some of that terminology and has a great story along with it. It also teaches you a lot more stuff about computers, but you have to read closely to pick up on it."
4,Good book on hackers sub-culture,"Actually this is a great book about the hacker sub-culture, indeed one of the bests I have ever read. This book describes very well the whole story and social aspects of New York City hackers but fails when dealing with technical aspects or lacks it. I can afirm it's a good book for people who are intersted to know how poor guys in Queens, NY, rised from nothing to create one of the most notorious hacker gang ever and to improve knowledge about the late 80's and early 90's american hacker scene."
2,Don't Bother,"After reading Cuckoo's Egg, this book isn't even in the county let alone the ball park. Not only could I put it down, but I had to psych myself up to open it. It was a painfully boring read and glorifying of criminals. There were very bright individuals, but criminals nonetheless. This book did NOT convey that message."
2,"Not bad, but terribly juvenile","Not a bad book on the whole. The story is interesting enough, but the author seems to take juvenile spats and revenge way too seriously. A litany of 14 year teenagers conversations (Woah, no way, serious?, cool, etc, etc) is really not that exciting. A real light read."
4,"Lucid, but not a complete entity of detail","Of course not all details would make a print. I just finished this book a half hour ago. Although a must read for those wanting to follow in anyone's footsteps portrayed in this book, or anyone really, the reality of what happens is written well but not in its totality. I liked the read but would have appreciated more detail, the real shpeel."
2,BORING,I thought the book was boring also. Rarely do I quit reading a book. But I could never seem to finish it.
1,The worst of the hacker-related titles...,"Where do I begin?This is the most boring of all the hacker-related titles; it took me 6 months to get through it. The real substance of this book could have been written in just 3 pages. The rest is just filler and fictionalized details. There are also a few technical inaccuracies, but with so little in the way of technical information, they really don't get in the way of the author's ""story"".If you're looking for fiction, why not just pick up a sci-fi novel, it'll be much less expensive and more entertaining. If you're looking for an interesting ""hacker"" read, pick up just about anything but this rag."
5,"Loved it, brings back lots of memories.",I loved this book. Brought back many memories about the 80s and the roots of computers and hacking. For anyone that wonders why people do the things they do regarding comptuers you should read it! Great book!
5,Highly Entertaining,"This book was cool, very interesting and highly entertaining. If you liked Cyberpunk (ISBN 0684818620) you will like this one even better.This book tells the story of old school NYC hackers like Phiber Optic, MOD and others, back in the late 80's hacking around the phone company networks and causing trouble. =)Since I started messing with computers back in the days of the Commodore 64, BBS's, and before the Internet was mainstream, this book was especially cool. Made me nostalgic for the old days. =)"
5,Absolute atmosphere led by dark sadness,"Beautiful keyboards, strange ambient rumbles, and gothic Gregorian chanting are the main sounds of the songs. These songs or ""arrangements"" were obviously written by a genious (or geniouses). If listening to music that surrounds you and digs deep sounds like something you'd like, I fully recommend this. Actually, I could swear this is more than just music."
4,"Dark, kinda spooky ... very satisfying","raison d'etre is Sweden's Peter Andersson, who composes beautifully dark music for this release. Wind, bubbling sounds, sudden noises, chimes, chanting, choruses, strings, and occasionally rhythms create an ambience that is terribly dark but beautiful at the same time.The low rumblings will shake your room, and the sudden jarring bangs and clangs might make you jump in your seat. There's an ominent spookiness throughout, but not threatening. The 6 tracks flow almost seamlessly from one to the next, but are different enough to keep the listener's interest. It's probably not my favorite RD release, but still makes a great listen."
4,Zen the magician,"I have always loved Michael Dibdin's great series on Aurelio Zen, the often bumbling but very Italian policeman, who solves the most amazing crimes. This is a brilliant film version of the books. Talk about getting it right - the characters are well acted and often times totally evil. Zen himself is suave and intelligent, but often swans through his cases, which seem to solve themselves! The main characters speak in English while the background language is Italian - a clever idea as it makes it easier for us poor English speakers, but at all times we know we are in the real Italy. And it is very Italian. This is a must see series."
2,"Thin Plots, Cliched Love, Indifferent Cops","I have not read any of the novels on which this series is based. I do know, however, that reducing a lenghty novel to 85 minutes means the plot will be slighted, if not completely emasculated or ignored. The show has virtually non-existent plots and lots of love looks between Zen and a fellow cop, who is shallow and poorly acted. The actor who plays Zen is charismatic and no doubt could have made a good detective in a show that was concerned with plot, even just a little bit concerned. I watched all three episodes simply to see Italy, hoping something along the lines of a plot would develop. No plot-- but there were action scenes and some smooching. This was a major disappointment. The 5 ratings are inexplicable and proof that a show can sink below mediocrity and still find an appreciative audience."
1,Nice shots of Rome but...,"...overall a rather pathetic attempt to describe real life events in Italy by somebody who obviously knows the country only in a very superficial manner. There are also several holes in the plots, unexplained events, downright silly dialogues and totally ludicrous situations.Too bad because the acting is decent, the show seems well produced and Rome is as gorgeous as ever. If you want to watch a nicely done mystery series set in Italy get a DVD of Commissario Montalbano by Camilleri. This is something to forget."
5,top quality,"Aurelio Zen is a police detective in Rome doing his best to do an honest job in the midst of the politics of Italian cronyism and intrigue on the highest level, often demanding contradictory outcomes, oblivious to the actual facts of the case. The script is wellwritten and the acting excellent. The filming of Rome is first class. We bought the three episodes currently available on DVD after having seen two episodes on public televiision. I only hope the BBC will make more episodes."
2,Disappointed,"If I hadn't read all of Dibdin's Zen books, many more than once, I might have enjoyed this series. Dibdin was a good writer; this series struck me as a banal (hurried? low budget?) effort. It has little correspondence with the novels. Granted the stories had to be greatly abridged, but so much of what made the novels enjoyable is missing; so much is changed (the addition of new characters, the changing of some character's names--why?), the plots so full of holes as to be almost incomprehensible, that I was very disappointed. I looked forward to the series because I liked the stories and the casting of Sewell as Zen. He is enjoyable to watch, as is the Roman setting. And I had hoped for more."
2,Unrealistic Policing,"Whomever researched for the writing and/or scripting of this series doesn't know anything about police administration or detective work e.g. the tte-à-tte in the police offices and elsewhere were ridiculously unbelievable if not sophomoric. The detective's failure to intelligently think through or anticipate problems including threats were just plain dumb. Even if he is intended to succeed through dumb luck it's still dumb. The acting is wooden (except Sewell has those mannerisms that in a primal communicative way can carry a scene but still a step down from his exceptional Dark City role). Anyway, the dialogue is also sophomoric. The show exists because of the actor's appearances and the usual tiresome romantic triangles. Nothing in the plot structure indicates to me any creative storytelling - it's all too predictable. On the positive side the English and background Italian set backgrounds were well conceived.It all reminds me of a cheap paperback romance-suspense novel."
5,Beautiful arrangements!!!,"This is one of the nicest sounding big band CDs I own. I purchased it for the wonderful arrangement of ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" from the movie ""State Fair"". I had heard it on my car radio on an AM station, in March, shortly after it was released. But I love every song on this CD! And believe me, they sound much better coming from my stereo CD player than on AM radio!"
1,How lame is this???,"It's pretty darn lame, and it isn't at all romantic. This cd is one that Ray as well has his listeners will throw up when they hear it. This is so sappy it makes me want to barf, it doesn't swing, and you can't dance to it. it's about as swinging as one of Mitch Miller's sing alo ng sets Skip this omne, it should have never been released"
4,"Nothing Earth Shattering, But Good","""Shaping School Culture"" is a good overview of the components of culture in a school community. The ideas could easily be applied to any group culture. Although there is nothing earth-shattering and no brilliant revelations, it provides a good lens through which to view the cultural dynamics present throughout the school."
4,Good book!,"Every Goodbye Ain't Gone was an entertaining read. I took the book on vacation with me. I read it in one day, but the impact of the story will be lasting. Congratulations to Brey on a job well done! I am looking forward to reading more of your work."
2,Awful vocals,"The guy in this band sounds exactly like the guy from crash romeo in terms of vocals. They're just too damn streched. Now don't get me wrong, I prefer higher pitched vocals to the all too common 'mono vox' we get in rock these days, but there's a limit to what I can take. This guy sounds like his voice box is going to explode from being streched so far. I mean, there's cute vocals, and then there's annoying vocals. Race the sun falls under annoying in the vocal catagory. Still though, the music itself is top notch if you like pop-punk. 2 1/2 stars."
1,Awful Movie Alert!,"Painfully cheap, brainless slasher flick from the person responsible ""Truth or Dare"" (also a cheap, no-brain slasher). Dude thinks his wife is boinking the neighbourhood so he starts dispatching folks in a series of goofy methods. The video label claims the gore effects will ""blow your mind"". Well, they blow alright. The acting ranges from god-awful to inhuman and the irritating Radio Shack keyboard soundtrack doesn't lessen the pain. Not even worth renting, let alone purchasing."
1,This movie is a JOKE!,"Yeah, if you're a film student, you could see this movie for tips. But to see this movie for pleasure, DO NOT BUY IT! It was a total waste of money for me. The acting was horrible, I laughed through the whole movie. I wanted to fall asleep. People seem to like this movie for its ""gore humor"", but I think the director tried too hard with that. Maybe the movie was suppose to look like crap, and that's what makes it good. That factor didn't appeal at all to me. The movie has that horrible 80's horror movie feel, and that killed it at the very beginning. The tall skinny blonde, the main character, should have rehearsed being sadistic a little longer. I think I liked two of his killings, I must admit. Not bloody and gory enough, but it was good enough. This DVD is the DVD I hide in the back of my collection, its an embarassment."
2,Pink Floyd [Copies],I had high hopes for this CD. I grew bored listening to it after the fourth track. It is only an average CD that left me wanting for more. I am a huge prog fan. This CD was very dissapointing. I got relly tired of hearing all of the keyboard effects. I would not reccomend this CD to anyone.
1,DO I HAVE TO GIVE IT 1 STAR?,WHAT A LOAD OF PURE REGRESSIVE DRECK THIS IS ...PINK FLOYD COPIES???? NOT EVEN CLOSE. SOUNDS LIKE CHURCH MUSIC WITH BAD SYNTHESIZERS. I WOULDN'T EVEN PUNISH MY WORST ENEMY BY MAKING HIM LISTEN TO THIS CRAP
4,Exciting Story,"I found this story exciting to read. At all times I worried about what would happen to Sammy and also to Kevin. We learn what happens to Sammy, but not to Kevin. I think readers will feel great empathy toward both characters and both situations."
2,The Crazy book,"Sammy, who is slightly retarded, ran away from home into the woods and became friends with a wild kid named Kevin. Both survived in the woods and had an adventure they will never forget. When Sammy asked to go home, Kevin would not allow him. Will Sammy have to live in the woods forever?This book isn't really exciting because I couldn't relate to the characters. It was easy to read with good descriptive language. But, I still give it a two stars because it wasn't so boring, but not so great."
2,Not so dainty afterall... with a bad clasp,"I purchased this item thinking that it would be similar to the picture on the site. I was a little disappointed in that the bracelet links are larger then they actually appear in the photo. The bracelet is still very nice looking but, again, larger than I had assumed it would be.The clasp is very hard to fasten and unfasten. Once the bracelet is fastened it stays fastened, literally. My problem is that when I put it on I have a HARD time getting it off. I'm sure that with some wearing the clasp will get easier. I just hope, after reading another review, that it will not get so easy that I end up losing it."
1,I returned these knives because they were serrated edge.,"There probably was nothing wrong with these knives if you wanted serrated edges but what I was looking for was the hard, solid edge so I returned these unopened. It's my fault for not paying closer attention to the fine print within the description."
3,good but with flaws,"The knifes are great, sharp, packaged well, but the tips were bent. Could have been better made. All in all not a bad buy."
2,booo,"knifes are not smooth and sharp, dont bother saving money on these spend a little more and get the orig.if i had it to do again i would not purchase these."
1,joe,"cheap junk. these knifes are ""micro serrated"" if you are not using a sawing motion they do not cut. you cant chop because the edge it wont go all the way through. im stuck with them and they suck. i would have never bought them if i knew they had this bogus edge."
1,Terrible,These knives are terrible worst product I have bought off amazon ever. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone they are micro serrated and rust very easily.
2,Be AWARE,"I was surprised to discover that the reason these knives are ""eversharp"" is because they are all micro-serrated blades. It makes it difficult to chop cleanly & VERY difficult to wash without destroying the sponge. Would not have purchased them if I had known."
3,Know what you are purchasing,"My wife wanted a quality set of knives. I've used Henckels at work, I have worked in the hospitality industry for years. This set is fine for home but not the quality I would purchase for work. I'm interested to see how long they keep their edge. To many cheap knives start out fine but lose their edge and you can't keep them sharp. Only time will time."
2,Didn't know they were serated,"I didn't know they were serated knives when I bought them. I wouldn't have, had I known. Product description not that descriptive."
4,good quality for the price,"I bought these as a christmas gift for my boyfriend and couldn't be happier. They might not be the knives for a professional chef, but they are perfect for anyone who wants a high-quality everyday knife set for the kitchen."
5,Great for the Price,"If you are on a budget, but are sick of blunt knives, these are great. I'm a hobby cook but I'm also a law student so I don't have $150 to spend on one Wusthof. This is a good price for good knives and they serve me really well. As my finger can attest, they are super sharp. It's also a good variety, I use every single knife. If you have to cut stuff, then you will want to cut stuff with these."
3,important story-poorly told,"Without understanding the hisory of the cold war you cannot make any sense out of the present state of the nation or of current events such as the disaster of Sept.11. This book attempts to give an overview of this enourmous subject from the end of WWII up until today. It is well referenced and informative and many non-historians would benefit from reading it. The main problem is that the writing is terrible. It reads like a first draft of a book that the author did not have the time or interest to craft into a real book. As such it is simultaneously interesting, informative and frustrating to read."
3,Hit and miss,"When they work, they work fine, but there are some issues that can make them a non starter...Size: They're big, they add about 2.5 inches to the height of the bulb, so for an enclosed fixture, you may need a smaller bulb to get it to fit. It will obviously also stick further out from a recessed lighting fixture so can look unsightly.Shape: The base above the screw is flat where as a flood for example is angled, so for a housing (like an outside flood housing) that is also angled, it wont screw in all the way and it wont make the electrical connection - you'll need an extension.Remote: I'm having some dead spots in spite of having four of these close together, so not sure the repeater aspect is working, at least not as well as the plug in modules. Maybe the housing is interfering with the signal. Having a plug in adapter in the same room seems to help."
3,Intermatic for Home Automation,"The module is slightly bigger than it appears, and it does make it difficult to fit in many lights or overhead light sockets (as the bulb sticks out when you do). However, it does function as stated. I am using this as part of a Vivint System - I have found that, if you use this, put it in a place and leave the light powered on (and let it control when you turn it on or off). Otherwise, your system will register it as malfunctioning and ask you to remove it (although it is actually functioning fine). Overall: Good item, adds several inches to the bulb, but functions just as advertised"
3,"Works great, but large!","I have zero Z-wave related problems with these units. My only issue which cost it 2 stars was that it didn't fit into any outdoor fixture that I have or could find.I've since installed them in the basement to control the lighting down there and extend the Z-wave network. They work great, if you can fit them into your fixtures."
2,The first z-wave product to disappoint me,"I was disappointed.It worked as advertised....but I expected more. It's advertised as having an override function. I took this to mean that if this is in your ceiling, the wall switch will still operate the device. It will not...I checked it out, the intention was for the black button on the unit to also function as the off/on switch (hard when it's 10 feet over your head in the garage). it worked as members of scenes ok, so it doesn't get one star, it gets only 2."
3,Great book on Access for the BEGINNER!,"If you have used other Office programs before and want to save a few bucks just go through Access's online help and explore with Access to figure how to do the simple stuff. This book has the same explanations and walkthrough you can get from the Access help menu. I prefer reading out of a book rather than on a computer screen however so the book was OK for me. This is really basic stuff, browsing through the book for an hour gave me all the basic knowledge I needed.If you want a more detailed and advanced book get Que's Special Edition Using Acess 2000"
5,One of the best,"The Legend of Huma was, and is,one of my favorite stories of all time. I first read this book when I was 11 years old, and enjoyed it then. I'm 26 now and still read it once a year or so.I'm not much a sci-fi fan, but this book has more to offer than dragons and knights. A very good story by Mr.Knaak"
4,A Good Book,"I would reccomend this more to people who have no prior knowledge of Dragonlance simply because then you wont know how it ends(like history flunkies that didn't know how titanic was going to end). That however doesn't detract from the quality of the book because it is not the book's fault. The character were good and the plot was good but pretty much everything was good, not great. The love story was par and the adventure of Huma and his find was okay but I felt it lacked some depth. I would say this is still a fun read but there are better books out there."
4,Best book of Richard Knaak,"This book is the best book I have read after Richard Knaak.My favorite character was Kaz. I was somtimes bored when I read about Huma feelings but otherwise it was great if you liked this one you should read ""Kaz the minotaur"" it's great too."
4,good,"this was a very good book. the begining was slow, but it got better. but there were a few things wrong. i thought huma and his dragon died frozen. like when sturm took the dragonlance from huma's hand in the chronicles. and, where was the white stag. other than that it was great. but huma should have died by a white dragon, to match the chronicles."
5,a gd read,"I remember reading this a long long time ago and intensely liking it in my youth. Recently dusted it off and read it again. surprisingly, I found out that I still loved it. At first I couldn't figure out why I liked it so much. there are certainly writers who offer more mature stories like jordan, tolkien and george rr martin.But it is precisely the innocence and humility of the main character, huma, that draws you. If you are the type who goes for the cocky and battle-hardened hero, this book is not for you. Richard a Knaak manages to pull a rabbit out of a hat with this story. It could have easily ended up sounding childish and trite (like a david eddings book) but it doesn't. so put down that ps2 joystick for one afternoon and read this book."
3,The Legend of Huma,"I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers and say that the book was well written. The problem was that I found two things to my disliking. One was, where was the romance between Huma and the silver dragon, it was not taken very far. Second was, me being a Raistlin fan and mage fan, I thought there was a dearth of scenes with Magius showing us why he was the greatest war mage. I keep waiting for Magius to do something to prove to me that he was the greatest war mage that all of Krynn knew, but it didn't happen and to my suprise he was killed while waiting for him to do something. And then his death and aftermath is like two or three pages. This book glorified Huma (which it should), but paid a disservice to Magius."
3,where was the white stag?,"all in all it was an ok book. i could understand that the bards didn't mention kaz in their stories because he was an minotaur, but i couldn't understand why the part with the white stag and the forestmaster wasn't mentioned. in the ""dragons of autumn twilight"" the forestmaster says herself that she met huma. why would she lie? i think this book was an 3+ almost 4 star book. knaak is a much better writer than jean rabe"
3,Usual stuff,"To be honest, this is exactly the same as the rest of the Dragonlance spinoffs. Nowhere near the Weis & Hickman series but sufficient for Dragonlance enthusiasts and Dragonlance gamers needing some direction. Buy it if you're an avid fan only."
3,What happened??,"Now, I would not have given this book only 3 stars. It doesn't quite deserve that. It's just that HELLO PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED TO ""and the white stag led him to an island, and there he met a woman..."" ""and he rode to the High Clerist's Tower..."" SEE!!!!!(regains composure) That didn't happen. Uh-uh. Did the Canticle say even one word about Kaz? Uh-uh. We have no idea whether he was supposed to exist originally or not. Trust me people, even if the other reviews (shoots a venomnous glance) say to buy this book, you might be better off just borrowing it. If you are really intent on buying this book no matter what, try to find it at a bargain price. It's still the same old plot about how good wins over evil with a sacrifice."
5,"It was great, it had it all, I espically loved the end.","It is one of the best books I've ever read. It has everything, from magic to minitors. Knights to dragon/humans. I loved when Huma found out he had freed a minitor.The end was so suspencfull."
2,Well...,"This book wasn't TOO bad. The writing was alright, although I could see the silver dragon part coming a mile away. There were just too many coinscidence for its own good, I think. Im a big dragonlance fan and I'll read any Dragonlance book,but overall, I think Tracy Hickman and Margeret Weis do a better job. (after all, they're the ones who started the whole thing!).@"
1,This book was a outrage!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read the Legend of Huma hoping that it would follow the guide lines set by the original trilogy. I was sadly dissappointed. It was horrible. What is this with a minataur he did everything. Huma never followed a white stag and never road I quote "" He rode to the high clerist tower where only the dead walked mouthing the names of dragons"" That never happened. It was a total load of junk I am severly dissappointed with your reveiw. But i must give the book some credit. It had a good cover. Never read it it was bad. Stick with Weis and Hickman or try Some Raymond E. Feist"
1,A Real Letdown To the Knights of Solamnia,"When I first picked up this book, I was excited. Here was the legend of Huma! But as I got into it, it just wasn't like all the other Dragonlance books I'd read. At least the others were believeable, but this? I just thought that it was very poorly written, the author left out some pretty important stuff, it was totally unrealistic even for fantasy, and they used the word ""Huma"" way too many times. Don't read it. You'll regret spending your money on it."
1,Ick!,"I hate to give any book a rating of 1 star, but I couldn't even get through the first sixty pages of this one (and I've read much longer books than this all the way through that were pretty bad)! If you want something to put you to sleep almost instantly, then go ahead and get it. Otherwise... don't bother."
2,Dissappointing!,"The Legend of Huma could have been a great story if it had been told right. Instead, we get a book full of plot holes, lifeless characters, pointless battles, and a romance that never develops.Worse, it's not even well written! I mean, what happened to the white stag Huma followed that was talked so much about in Dragons of Autumn Twilight? Knaak must have forgotten to read the ORIGINAL Dragonlance books! I can't see why so many people think this is the best book ever, but they really should wake up and read some truly good books."
5,highly recommended for anybody!,"Eager to get into the DL series I picked up this one because it was a best seller and I couldnt wait to order in the core's, and I did not regret it, Knaak does an amazing job in telling the story of the legendary Huma all the while captivating the reader with a fast paced plot and wondreful battle segments full of action, dragons etc that never dull and always propel the storys momentum further.This is one of my favourite books, I was saddened when it was over as it is such an amazing book, if you only read one DL book make it this one!"
5,THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"This is the absolute best book that I have ever read in my life. Kaz is the best character and I just order """"Kaz the Minotaur."""
5,A very good book!!!,This novel was one of the first fantasy novels I have read. It was excellently written and the author did a good job a very good job. This DL novel got me started on the DL series and now I own over 15 books.
5,"This is a thrilling, fast paced story.","I have read the legened Of Huma at least 15 times, so I obviosly had a good reason to keep coming back. This story starts form the get go and keeps getting better. It tells a compelling story of Huma, Knight of Solamnia. Huma meets a new friend in the begining, Kas the Minotaur, under unlikley circmustances. Together they travel with Huma's astranged childhood best-friend Magius, a powerful renagade magi, to find the legendary Dragonlances"
5,A book self sacrifice and love,I read this book when I was younger and had forgotten what it was to be a hero of a land that needs heroes
4,This is a really fun game!,Batman Begins is a really fun game. The best part is that it is really good for spies. The only thing I don't like about it is the jump attack. You always miss the bad guy and I also have to say there are too many bad guys with guns. Arkum asylum is especially bad. But still it is a really fun game. Buy it now!
1,Sway,There is way too much play where the rack fits into the receiver. I used the threaded pin and had others check to see if it was done properly. This thing is not usable.
3,so what?,"The velcrow to tie the bike down is very flimsy and in a short time, exposd to the elements, I feel will not last very long. Can these be replaced once this happens?"
1,"No deal, but good deal.","The vendor for this item emailed that the item was not as offered, and cancelled the order, although giving me the chance in the email to take the item they had, which I declined.So bad deal, they offered what they didn't have.So good deal, they made it as right as possible.I would not hesitate to order an item from this vendor."
4,Nice rack!!!,Good bike rack for the money. It is a little loose in the tow hitch tho. Just used a shim and it was fine tho.
3,It's okay...,I suggest you go through more pages to find exactly what you're looking for. There's a few of the pages I didn't use just because it made no sense! Why have green camo pages for the Navy? Most of them wear the aqua-flage?
