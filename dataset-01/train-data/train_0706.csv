3,Not closed captioned in English,"I bought this box set as a birthday present for a friend who is hard of hearing, thinking that he could use the closed caption option.I was shocked to find that all the DVD's in all of the James Bond boxed sets are NOT closed captioned in English!They are only closed captioned in French and Spanish.How can they sell these these DVDs in the USA, label them as ""closed captioned"" and not state on the box that they are NOT closed captioned in English?"
3,MGM slcked off with the last set,"My collection does not feature any of the errors that have been reported in the other reviews, but it is possible that some sets have errors while others do not. MGM did slack off with these titles though. Only ""From Russia With Love"" features the interacive still gallery that was standard in all the previous collections. I got the feeling that this collection was more rushed than the other two. While they are still great DVDs, they are disappointing when compared to the previous sets. This probably explains why these titles are selling for less than the other ones. Still, it's good to have for anyone who wants to complete their set."
2,Horrible set,"This set os aboslutely horrible. Not only do you get the awful ""Diamonds are Forever,"" but you get the even more awful ""A View to a kill."" The others are so-so. ""You Only Live Twice"" gets my vote fore most action in a Sean Connery/Bond film, but the plot leaves something to be desired. ""Octopussy,"" is pretty good, and deserves a good 4 stars. Some good stunts and acting, but Moore is getting really old. (He was 56 when he did ""Octopussy"" and 58 when he did ""A View to a Kill"") ""The Living Daylights"" is OK. Timothy Dalton is good, as is the car he has. ""From Russia With Love"" is undoubtedly the best in the set. In this DVD we get Sean Connery, good acting, action, sets, suspense, everything a bond film needs that I can't think of.all in all: don't buy this. go buy From russia with love sperately in stead"
1,rip off,"Come on! There is only one movie in this entire set that I want to buy, but I have to spend nearly 100 dollars?! Why can't they sell these movies individually? This is just a way for them to totally rip us off and make us buy some of the Bond movies that we don't care about or that we may already have. Why should I buy 8 movies just to get the one I want? Save your money! Sooner or later the suckers that actually wasted all this money will be bringing their used ones that they don't want to the used dvd stores. Just wait until you see one there and buy it. Don't waste money on this unless you just happen to want all 8 movies in the set. Then maybe it's worth it."
1,bad,sean connery is the tru james bond.& brecking up the bond set suck's.because I want to buy on her majesty's secret service but I want sean connery.
3,Pretty good,"Was excited to get this book. Got it used from one of Amazon's booksellers and it was in excellent condition. Anyway, most of the book describes period furniture characteristics and there's only a small portion of the book dedicated to actual plans for furniture. The book has some nice templates that you can photocopy, attach to wood and cut. However, the book falls short in my opinion on actual technique. It give a brief overview of tools needed but I was hoping it would have been a little bit more detailed. Also, there could be more plans included with the book. I'm not sure how valuable the majority of the book is going to be. I was hoping for more plans. The plans that it does have are top notch designs. There's even needlepoint charts to replicate some fabric designs for the furniture."
1,Poorly Made,I used these gloves for a few hours of bouldering. The stitching is poorly done and they fell apart at the seams and the fabric dissolved from the exposed edges. I was highly disappointed.
3,Fit is odd. Probably would fit well on piano player fingers,These are a comfortable design; but the fit is a disappointment. The fingers are extra long but narrow. I think the gloves would fit better on those with piano-player-stereotype fingers.
5,Great for Hard Workers,"As someone who is constantly working outdoors these gloves are absolutely perfect. They are durable, protective, and comfortable no matter what the job at hand is. I do a lot of landscaping, and I was worried they wouldn't be able to last a day let alone a week of constant wear. But it has been several weeks now and all of the stitching is as intact as the first day I received them. And the price is unbeatable for the quality of the product."
3,"Great gloves, they will wear out quickly","I love these gloves, they are so much nicer than a standard leather work glove that fits loosely. With these gloves, you don't lose the dexterity that you do with the bulky leather work gloves. You'll still be able to screw something in without having to take off the gloves, which you'll find next to impossible with the leather work gloves.Love that they were machine washable. Hands do get sweaty in them but I never really noticed it, you don't get the clammy feeling that you get with a cowhide glove.After about 6-8 months of homeowner use, stacking wood, putting in wooden fence posts, raking leaves, etc. the gloves began getting holes in the fingers. Not sure yet if I'll replace with another set of these or look for a set of gloves from another manufacturer."
5,These Gloves FIT!,"I am 6'6"" tall. I have hands the size of small canoe paddles. On most XL gloves the fingers are about 1/2 to 3/4 as long as my fingers. These gloves fit. They are extremely comfortable. They seem to have a great balance between toughness and dexterity. I just used them to put up a fence, really splintery wood, no splinters. I was able to easily retrieve screws, nails etc from my tool belt. I will definately buy them again!"
5,Perfect fit,"I have a hard time finding gloves that fit my wide and stubby fingered hands. I'm a firefighter, and I go through gloves very, very quickly. I ordered these gloves on hopes that I would eventually find the perfect glove for me. I could not have been more surprised and excited to find that the gloves not only fit perfectly, but are tough and hard working as well. I use these gloves on the fire ground for clean up (wet and dirty), overhaul ( VERY wet and dirty, usually with lots of odd debris), and loading hundreds of feet of wet LDH / large diameter hose. The nice soft patch of cloth on the backside of the thumb is a nice touch to wipe sweat from your face or eyes. I highly recommend these gloves as ""Fire Ground Tested""."
1,Tore on first day,"I am a landscaper who purchased these gloves with the intention of using them daily at work. The first time I wore them was during a saturday of work around my house. After a few hours of moving some stone for a wall I am building and raking some leaves, I noticed two tears along the seams on both middle fingers. The seam along my left index finger was also beginning to tear. I may have been putting some serious stress on the gloves as I was moving some of the larger pieces of stone but was surprised to see them ripping so soon. Very expensive throw away gloves, wouldn't recommend buying if you will be doing and hard work."
3,Reasonable glove,"You can see several of my recent glove reviews and compare. This is an ordinary synthetic glove that will be no better or worse than most. In this price range or slightly cheaper, I prefer the DeWalt glove. None of them is anything special and they all will work fine, so price is what to look for. As with most synthetic gloves, the stitching that holds the palm protective material onto the stretchy glove part is the first thing to go. Once the stitches start to go, then the palm material begins to do the Bohemian flap dance and will catch on things. It is best to retire the gloves or rip off the palm parts at this point and just run them into the ground before throwing them out. This is a decent glove but I think for a few buck less you can get a glove that will perform just as well."
2,Eh...,"Gloves kept hands dry due to sweat absorbing material, though after only 1 week of use, they began to smell. The stitching on the cradle was not very sturdy and after only two weeks of heavy use the stitching began to com out, resulting in a dime size hole. These gloves are not for heavy continuous use."
1,Fell apart in s very short time,"stitching all came apart along the sides of fingers. not worth the price at all. I work outdoors and handle wood, rocks, dirt and the like I've use cheaper and better built gloves before this pair"
2,gloves,"the gloves were very useful for about a month then they slowly ripped at the fingers and just constantly got worse from there, all i was doing was planting flowers and placing mulch."
2,"Good gloves, but they wear out fast!!!!",If you are doing any kind of hard work these gloves will wear out in less than one week.
5,Very nice gloves,"I am an electrician so gloves that can pick up and hold small objects are very important to me. These gloves can do that, and are tough enough for demolition. They seem to be better made than those other gloves that fall apart in a couple of months of use."
4,Excellent quality and fit,I received these as work gloves for use around the house and yard. The quality of the construction is excellent and the fit is perfect. I got the XL size and they are sized similar to other work gloves and fit well. The fit is tailored to the hand and amazingly comfortable.
2,Not for hard use,"When I got these about two weeks ago I was impressed. They fit good and looked very tough. They are comfortable and the velcro strip keeps them on. I do a lot of outdoor work and was going through a pair of leather gloves about once a month so I thought I'd pay a little more and get something to last longer. Big Mistake! After only wearing these for about two weeks, and not a particularly hard two weeks at that, I notice they are already coming apart at the seam on one finger. There is so much stitching on these gloves it was inevitable that one would fail but I hoped not this soon. I would not waste my money on these again."
4,Quality work gloves,"Provides good grip and insulation in colder weather (~40 degrees F). A few threads have come loose on the palm after using gloves 10+ times, but it is still holding together well. I use them primarily when doing yard work and basic maintenance around the house. Recommended, good price."
5,nice quality,The initial quality level seems very high. I haven't put them to real work yet but my guess is they will be long lasting
2,Disappointed,That you see in the picture is not what is in the description. When I contacted them reguarding this they disagreed with me and said I could return them providing I paid shipping. Why should I pay for shipping for a product that was misrepresented. I'm in the construction trade and buy about 20 pairs of these gloves a year and the gloves pictures are CLC Custom Leather Craft Tradesman Gloves not Youngstown General Utility Glove. The CLC glove is far superior and lasts about twice as long.
1,100 plays for the out-door theatres,I was very disappointed when I recieved this book. I thought it would include actual 'plays' for the out door theatre. Instead it is just a 'list' of very old plays from the early 1920's. I would really like to return it and get my money back. I feel deceived.
5,Very Happy!!,The CD was like new!! I have been listening to it over and over!! Great delivery time as well!!
1,Caution-Defective MP3 Download,"Referring to the MP3 downloaded version of this. I didn't download this whole thing, but I did get Opportunities-Original 12"" Mix... and it skips! About 1:42-1:43 into it. It's like listening to a defective record (for all you youngsters out there who don't know what that is, records were the form of media that we old folks had to put up with before CD's came along (and for you even younger kids, CD's were what we had to put up with before MP3's came along)). Anyway, Amazon very kindly refunded the purchase amount. But I would have preferred a non-defective version."
3,too brief for anthing new to be learned,"The books is basically a collection of bullet points regarding mediation.It is a nice summary if you are already familia with the ideas presented therein.However if you are new to mediation, you will be disappointed as this book does not go into detials to explain the ""Bullet Point"" ideas presented therein."
4,Very nice and pretty,"This is a pretty watch. The numbers 12 and 6 embrossed on the dial makes it prettier. However, you think that its very small. However, inspite of that I liked it."
2,Not durable,"I had a pair of these box handler gloves. They are designed to give you grip on slippery surfaces such as box sides. These started to delaminate and shred after maybe a dozen occasions. For the money that's pretty bad. I would suggest you buy something like theseGlovePro Black Magic Glovesas their price is more in line with short term disposable. I love the concept, just not the execution by Youngstown."
2,Not SO good at all..,This book is only good for basic idea how to design simple bridge... bridge is the most difficult/complex structural design. It can't be done as this book shown.
3,mixed feelings,"To me, the best movies in this collection are ""Dam Busters"", ""Cruel Sea"", and ""Went the Day Well?"" All are excellent. ""Colditz"" struck me as a forerunner of ""The Great Escape,"" and stars the wonderful John Mills. But I had a hard time seeing ""The Ship That Died of Shame"" as WWII history, except for about ten minutes in the beginning. Dam Busters is exquisite and based on a true story, while the Cruel Sea is an old favorite of a British corvette guarding convoys against U boats. Went the Day Well is a marvelous tale of Nazi invaders disguised as British paratroopers who attempt to hold a strategic coastal village hostage for a weekend. All were interesting, but for the price, I was expecting five first-rate pictures. Maybe next time..."
3,Pretty Good,"I'm a fan of the Brady Bunch and have always thought that Maureen McCormick (Marcia) had a teriffic voice. She still does on this CD, and she does not disappoint. My only wish is that it wasn't country. Maureen's ""twang"" sounds forced and a little silly, considering that she's from California. I liked it better when she sang pop tunes on It's a Sunshine Day, the Brady Bunch CD. Anyway, if you like her voice, I'd still get this CD just because she's Marcia! Maybe Maureen will release a new pop CD today; if she does, I'll buy it."
3,A Little Bit Could Be More,"About five minutes after I ordered this cd I thought, ""What on Earth did I just do!"" I even started to dread its' arrival. I've always liked Maureen and really din't want to blow an illusion.When the cd arrived I asked a friend to listen first. For some reason she didn't jump on it so after it sat on her desk a few days I took it home. I had prejudged it by the few reviews here. So, there I was expecting the worst and popped it into the stereo. trac one, then trac two, three and soforth. I didn't gag so I listened again. You know what? It wasn't the greatest of country albums, I'll admit. It's not the worst either. It's okay. Sometimes just okay can be kind of groovy.. in its own way. I hope to get a chance to hear what Miss McCormick can really do with her voice."
3,OKAY,"This cd, I thought was okay. Lets face it, it would not be on my 10 albums to take to a desert island. I love Marcia, which is why I bought it. There are several songs on here that are upbeat, and than there are the others that are slow, you wished that they'd just stop. Maureen does show up how well a performer she is and that she can sing any number of notes. More or less, I wish that there would have been some more songs that she was used to singing, or even a duet with Barry Williams, aka...Greg. Who is this guy she say with?? Noone knows!"
1,"Oh no, Moe!","This is the first solo album by ""Marcia Brady"". It is done in the contemporary country music style. To call this album ""bad"" would be an understatement. It is flat out awful. Maureen has an okay, but unexciting voice. The main problem here is the material. The songs, for the most part, aren't very good. One good song here is a cover of Buddy Holly's ""Oh, Boy!"", but the performance is uninspired. There is also a duet here with Wayland Patton (who?). This album is not ""so bad it's good"". It's ""so bad it's boring"". A must to avoid."
5,Music you won't expected to hear off a kid's movie. Rich R&B,"Even if you think Dr. Dolittle is the worst movie ever you still needed to pick up this album! Of course Aaliyah's ""Are You That Somebody?"" is the thunder in this CD but it has great songs from Ray J. and Timbaland. Like said in past review Aaliyah was the ONLY and emphasis on ONLY r&b song to hit #1 on TRL which is a shame because I would like to see more songs like this at #1 but rewarding to know Aaliyah showed the Pop and Rock world who's boss. Buy the CD, you'll like it.Love you Aaliyah! You will always be remembered! This song was the 1st song I ever liked. This CD was my first CD ever. Rest in Peace and Glory! God Bless!"
3,Dr. Dolittle Soundtrack Does Little For Me,"This is an O.K. soundtrack. I'm being generous with this rating. I really didn't like the soundtrack as a whole, but some songs were pretty good. A lot of the songs are pretty good, but not that rememberable. The only really really good song (in my own opinion) is Aaliyah's ""Are You That Somebody?"" Now that song alone deserves 5 stars all the way! It's a shame she had to waste such a hit on this soundtrack. She shoulda kept that baby for her own album!!! The only song on this CD that I really can't stand is the All Saints version of ""Lady Marmalade"". Compared to the new Christina version, it reeks. Other than that, the soundtrack is o.k. overall. I wouldn't really reccomend this, I liked the movie better. BUT you should read the other reviews and get other opinions, too! Don't let me ruin it for ya. So, enjoy!"
2,FIRST FOUR....,"This CD is okay until you get past the first four tracks. Mad props to Aaliyah, Ray J., Timbaland, and Montell. But Changing Faces is HORRIBLE!Aaliyah pushed this album through the top. And it's good she did, 'cause otherwise it wouldn't be any good at all..."
2,Renaldo says it could be better . . .,"Although this is a soundtrack, it still could be a little more cohesive. Five of the tracks are produced by Timbaland, and four of those are the best songs on the album. Other stuff like ""Woof Woof"" and that Sugarhill song should've been left in the studio. I say don't buy it, you'll be sadly disappointed."
5,Awesome,"I honestly only like one song in the cd. But it's worth it. The price was great, itunes was charging way more for the cd (couldn't buy the song by itself) Thank you."
2,Boring!,"Except for a few gems, this CD reeks. The songs are tired and uninspired music with no real passion. I was really unmoved by any of the songs here. A lot of the same snap!-crackle!-pop!-type sound that is so popular today. Boring! Check out Rage Against the Machine or Earth Crisis for true passion and unbridled energy in music. And see what intelligence in lyrics is about. Although somewhat militant, at least these bands make you think! --Kelly Magovern"
4,ITS GOT IT GOIN' ON!!,This soundtrack is da bomb!!! Most of the songs are orginal and done well and the ones that are covered sound great. My favorite is LAdy Marmalade its the bomb. The best CD i've bought in a while!!
5,The Best Ever,"It is the best r&b/rap soundtrack since the soul food album. I love Aaliyah's song "" Are you that somebody"" and Genuine's "" Same ol' G"" great for parties!"
1,A Bad Movie Soundtrack,"The Dr. Dolittle Movie Soundtrack Album Didn't Do Much of Great Music.Some of The Music I Did Like, and Those Songs Were ''Are You That Somebody'', ''Same Ol' G'', and ''Push 'em Up''. The Rest of The Tracks on The Soundtrack Were Anoying and Very Dumb. Overall, The Soundtrack is Only Worth Owning For Only 3 Songs, and It Isn't Very Good.Overall Rating-1/5"
5,"I love the CD, my favorite song is are you that sombody",my favorite song is are you that sombody(da bomb)i saw it on the mtv summer jam countdown and loved it so much i went and got the cd
3,What a Disappointment...,"I loved the previous three PotC movies, so I was looking forward to watching this one. I started it 4 times. I finally finished when it was the movie in the DVD player while I worked out.Depp tried to make things funny -- but the script really missed the mark. Maybe it was because of the history with Will and Elizabeth, but I just could not connect with the Penelope Cruz character. Thus, I didn't connect with Blackbeard, either.Everything just felt forced and expected. Very disappointing."
5,4 for 4!!!,I loved the first three Pirates movies and loved this one just as much. I received this item in the time frame specified and in excellent condition.
4,Entertaining,"The whole family enjoyed this movie. We liked the whole series. For those who would be concerned, their is a voodoo doll and other supernatural stuff of a dark nature in the storyline. The actors all do a fine job. I never thought Johnny Depp made much of a pirate, but by this movie I was getting used to his silly facial make-up and his character was starting to grow on me."
3,so-so,Not as good as the others but it's great to see Captain Jack Sparrow again!I don't think I would have bought it if I had rented it first...
4,"Not my favorite of the set, but still amazing!","Who doesn't love them some Capt'n Jack Sparrow?! Johnny Depp provides yet another great performance as the fictional captain that we've all come to know and love. This wasn't my favorite of the four Pirates of the Caribbean movies but it's still outstanding. The cast did a wonderful job, the acting and special effects were phenomenal, as expected.One thing that did drive me crazy was that I really wanted to know what happened with the priest and the mermaid at the very end. Sequel anyone?Looking forward to buying this DVD the second it hits the shelves. So good. Can't wait! Keep us all drooling, Jack!"
4,Worth the view,"All I needed to say after seeing this movie was good sequel, fits into the series well. Enjoyed the refreshing new cast Especially Penelope Cruz and story. Will be buying it when it comes out. Again may not be your favorite of the 4 pirates installments thus far but defanitly a good solid film. Can't wait for the 5th installment."
5,Captain Jack Sparrow is back!!!,I really liked it!! Much better than the third installment. I felt they caputered a similar mood as the first Pirates movie (Black Pearl) which remains my favorite. But how can you not LOVE Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow! I even enjoyed the mermaids....!
3,"Very pretty, Plot?","Loved the visuals, but lacking a plot. They had allot of potential in the new characters, but didn't follow through. Somewhat expected, very flashy, great 3D. Defiantly a great movie to watch for the visuals and it's worth it for that point."
2,Not The Pirates of the past,I feel that this sequence was put together fast for the money. It was not at all the quality of previous Pirates of the Carribean movies.
4,Great gift,Gave this to a friend for a gift and she loved it. Nice that I can still find regular DVDs and not Blue Ray.
4,Nearly as good as the first!,"After a somewhat disappointing trilogy, this new Pirates movie does not disappoint. It gets back to the basics of humorous dialogue and great action sequences. While retaining a good portion of the original cast, the introduction of new characters was smooth. Although it is more or less independent of the trilogy, Stranger Tides still fits well within the created universe. Its ending leave enough room to bring about a follow up without it seeming forced. Overall a good movie!"
3,Okay Movie - The Blu-Ray Resellers Annoy Me,"The movie was decent, but the bigger 'quality' issue I have is with all these annoying resellers that get the two disk combo, then pull out the DVD and sell the Blu-Ray on its own so they can double their profit. I personally think Amazon should BAN those resellers since they're advertising their wares under the Heading of ""Enter Name of Movie Here"" (Two disk Blu-Ray, DVD combo). I don't care if they are putting in comments like ""Blu-Ray only"" or ""Doesn't include DVD"". They shouldn't be selling them under the heading of a product listed as a multidisk combo set... ESPECIALLY if they're listing is as 'Used-Like New'. That description means like new with all disks and original packaging; not a single disk in a CD jewel case.I've complained to Amazon about this practice, but I think others should as well."
4,This is the day you ALMOST caught Captain Jack Sparrow!,"Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow and he does a terrific job as usual. This movie was alot easier to follow than at worlds end was. This made it alot easier to just enjoy the movie. Now the 3D was not all that spectacular, that is why I only gave it 4 stars. If it would of had better 3D effects 5 stars no doubt."
3,An ok movie,"The fourth installment of the Pirates series is a reasonably fun movie. It is very difficult after three movies to meet the raised bar of expectations. The story is fun (they have to find the fountain of youth) but it is hardly unique. The visual effects are nice but they mimic the ones in the previous movies. Johnnie Depp is good, as always, as is Geoffrey Rush. Aside from that, expect this to be a mildly entertaining movie. This would be a decent rental from your local rental store or machine."
4,Good Action and fun,"Johnny Depp returns to the well once more for Pirates 4- On Stranger Tides. Losing some original cast members doesn't hurt as the movie is action filled, scary in spots and with many good special effects.Early on in the movie there is a big chase scene through Old London which is vry well done. Another higlight is the dramatic and scary mermaid attack scene. The plot is a bit easier to follow here than in the earlier sequels also. As always, Depp is great as Jack and he gets good support from the rest of the cast. Cruz is good but her role doesn't give her all that much to do, still a very entertaining sequel- 4 stars."
3,New plot but same jokes,"After the disappointment of the third Pirates film, I knew there would be a break. However, after a four-year break, producer Jerry Bruckheimer decided to take the franchise in a new direction. Instead of continuing where the story left off at the end of ""At Worlds End"", Bruckheimer thought it would be best to start fresh with a new plot line.""On Stander Tides"" is about Captain Jack Sparrow trying to find the fountain of youth. He is competing against his old foe Captain Barbossa and the Spanish to find it.With the new plot and characters, ""On Stranger Tides"" is better than ""At Worlds End"" but is nowhere near ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".If you are a fan of Captain Jack Sparrow, you will find this film entertaining as Johnny Depp does a great job as Captain Jack Sparrow."
1,"Awful, Just Awful","This is not a good movie at all. In fact this movie is an insult to the first 3. Long, boring, and well....just plain not good. It certainly didnt help that Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom were not in the film. Weak supporting characters in the 4th installment."
3,not without the extras,"no, I'm not going to buy it when it's not hd and there are no extras. I'd prefer to get it off itunes or wait to rent when it's available."
2,Not so good,"One and two was good one i could look at over again, but this one i think that it was over done an to long. I fell asleep on it so the next day I watched the rest an I just wasn't feeling it I think it's a rap on Pirates of the caribbean."
5,Loved it Loved the mermaids,You do not need to use the same characters to get a good effect. Many told me Penelope Cruz did not do a good job. Well I beg to differ. I thought I would miss Orlando and Keira but this movie stood on its own and was great. Who does not want to find the fountain of youth. I enjoyed Johnny Depp as always. Great movie.
3,Same Ol' Pirates.,"After 7 years we return back to the days of Captain Jack Sparrow and the swashbuckling mayhem of Pirates of the Caribbean. Under new leadership of Rob Marshal and replacing Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightly (For now) with Ian McShane & Penelope Cruz it makes for another action packed, laugh filled Pirates adventure.Simply put, if you have seen the first 3 and you liked the first 3, then 'On Stranger Tides' will be movie you will like as well. I was glad that they went back to the first film and realized that a simple easy to follow story is better than something overly complicated. Having Johnny Depp & Geoffrey Rush do what they do best as Jack and Barbosa, it's a winner. Still, the fact that it is just another 'Pirates of the Caribbean', well it may not always be a good thing.So apparently there will be a possible Pirates 5 & 6 as a ""New Trilogy"" I am wondering where the next adventure will be."
5,Best movie 2011,"Even the fourth part of the Pirates of the Caribbean saga was very entertaining with great music, wonderful actors and a lot of fun. While most movies were very disapointing in this year, Pirates of the Caribbean - On Stranger Tides surpassed my expectations and is by far the best movie of the year 2011. I can't wait to see the next PotC adventure!"
2,Really?,I was so disappointed in Pirates of the Carribean on Stranger Tides. None of the amazing special effect as the first two. The story line was totally lame and the casting terrible. Penelope Cruz may be cute but she was miscast in this movie. I felt no credible connection between her and Johnnie Depp's character plus it was extremely difficult to understand what she was saying. Johnnie Depp acted throughout the movie as though he was bored. Ho hum another one. Just didn't get it for me. My husband felt the same way.
2,Not really the best,"I enjoyed the first 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but this one didn't really grab me. What I really didn't understand was the love between the preacher pirate and the mermaid. It didn't tie into the plot at all. At least Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann got to know each other through the first 3 and you got an idea of the grounds for their love. Penelope Cruz was an interesting pick for the female lead. She has worked with Johnny Depp before and both are very talented, but in this movie, talent seemed not to be there. Penelope seemed like a cardboard character and Johnny Depp seemed like he was bored with the whole thing. It's no wonder they're re writing the script for the next one. The whole movie seemed to be rushed, the plot was all over the place and not solid and the script was not well written. They need to work a lot harder for the next Pirates of the Caribbean, or they're going to lose the audience. It was not the Johnny Depp you know."
2,Not a pleasant Cruz,"Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this movie very much, and I enjoyed Penelope Cruz even less. I found her voice and the dialogue to be annoying. I'm glad I didn't have to pay anything to watch this film, but I lost a few hours of my life that I'll never get back."
5,On Stranger Tides,This product arrived in the promised condition in a timely fashion so that we could enjoy the movie together as a family over the Christmas holiday.
4,pirates 4,just as good quality in both video and audio as the rest of theseries.looking forward to pirates 5.
4,"Well done, but didn't love the storyline","Greaty acting, directing and cinematogrophy, but I did not like the storyline as much as I thought I would. Nonetheless, worth watching."
3,Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"I thoroughly enjoy the POTC series, until this one. It bored me. I was very disappointed to find the original cast lacking long time members. They were missed and much needed to enliven this weak tale. The love/hate relationship between Barbosa and Sparrow is one of the few perks in it. But even that has grown more dark, serious and less humorous. I hope if a part four is dared Disney learns from this one."
3,Yikes!,"Not nearly as good as the first ones, OK, but not up to the usual standard. Naturally there were plenty of laugh parts [thanks to Johnny Depp]."
2,Avoid this Awful SEQUEL !!!,Did the writers of this movie see the previous versions??? This was awful. I can see why Orlando and Kierra decided to pass on this . I do not understand why Pennilpe C. did it . Something I am sure she wishes now would not be in her resume. Pass on this if you can!!!
3,just another pirate movie,this is just a final part of the series. Somehow it was not overly impressive and I was not looking to be knocked off of my feet. The cast did what you would expect them to do considering their collective skills.
2,"Good Action and visuals, nothing more","While the action is good, Jack Sparrow is charming as ever and some parts are funny; there are certain aspects that pull this film down. The plot of this film is very disjointed and poorly written, , Jack, Angelica and other characters are always bickering, the mermaids have vampire fangs (WTF? O_O) and there are too many plot twists and turns that hinder the movie from top to bottom which makes the plot hard to care about. The plot twists and turns worked well in the first movie but they don't do well in the sequels considering how the plots of them don't turn out well. Anywho this movie would've been better if it's issues were fixed. It's not an awful film, but it certainly isn't the worst; its medicore yet enjoyable. 6.5/10"
2,"Decent movie, will own it after DVD release","If you're a fan of Johnny Depp's zany character and enjoy the more adventurous family movies, you won't be bored with this one. We saw it in the movie theater when it came out and my 10-year-old was enthralled the entire time. I'd give this movie 3 out of 5 stars if I were rating the movie on its own merits.However, I'm deducting a star for this release itself on principle. I own a Blu-Ray player and a DVD player, but the studio's attempt to force people to purchase Blu-Ray or wait another month for the DVD is brazenly obnoxious. I'll wait a few weeks and save $10, thank you - I like having a choice. If, that is, that I'm not so steamed by then that I choose not to buy the movie at all."
1,No very entertaining,This by far is the worst Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The writing really stunk. Very good acting by Johnny Depp but he can't carry the movie alone. Wish i wouldn't have bought it!Fast shipping and Amazon prices are hard to beat though!
4,"Aside from the first one of the series, this is the one I liked best","12.26.2012Not sure why anyone would buy this movie unless they've seen it and liked it, or if someone asked for it as a gift, I suppose.....But buying it used on Amazon.com is the way to go. We paid less than $14 for it to be shipped to our house and it would have cost us more than that to go to the movies for two adults!And seriously, it's a good one - worthy of paying the extra for the difference between DVD and Blue Ray, though this comes with DVD just in case. But if you have a big screen, surround system and a good blue ray player, grow some patience and wait for these types of movies to come out on blue ray. It's really not all that different from the big screen experience."
3,No where near as good,"No where near as good as the other movies in the series, was hoping for something more but it was just not there."
4,"A bit of a let down, but still enjoyable.","There is fun to be had here, but for fans of the Jack Sparrow character, he's really not used particularly well here. I also miss the skeleton crew of the first movie. Here, only one man has any real magic power, and his crew is basically prosthetic zombies. Not as cool as previous movies. Still, Depp's Sparrow is fun and keeps you watching."
2,Disappointing......Characters in search of a story.,"I really liked the first of the series, great fun and interesting characters and a story while fantastic in terms of ghosts and ghost ships, contained some wit and heart. As far as I'm concerened it's been downhill ever since. And this last installment didn't reverse the trend. Characters in search of a story is my view. Thought the first 20 minutes or so were very entertaining and thought they might actually been on to something. but alas after the exciting and funny coach escape, it was all downhill from there. And does this group ever do anything in the daylight? One dark and dingy scene after another. Why bother with exotic locations when you never get to see any of them. Sorry folks - three times bitten (the three sequels to this point), ever more shy. Captain Jack and his merry band will do whatever they want in the future without this man's support."
3,Stranger & Stranger,"Johny Dep is once again Captain Jack Sparrow-no surprises there. He recycles the same material from earlier movies, but is more effemanent than ever. Kiera Knightley has been replaced by Penelope Cruz She's hot & supposed to be the love of his life, but I don't feel the chemistry.There are a lot more sword fights, storms & pirate booty, but it's a bit thin. The mermaids are demented! That whole mermaid bit could have been re-thought b/4 production, I think.I enjoyed this movie for what it is, light comedy. Definitely see it if you've seen the others. It's not much different, but why stop watching now?"
5,Pirates of The Caribbean - On Stranger Tides DVD,"I was glad to find this DVD on Amazon. The only format sold in stores was the DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack and this was a gift for someone who does not own a blu-ray player and I didn't want to spend the extra money. Of course it's a great movie, Johnny Depp is in it!"
5,Pirates of the Caribbean: on Stranger Tides,"Got this one for my oldest granddaughter. She loves Johnny Depp, as I do, and this was one of her requests for Christmas this year. We both find the ""Pirates"" movies enjoyable, funny, and exciting all at the same time. And we do enjoy watching J. Depp weave his way through the movie from start to finish with devilish humor."
4,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Price was within my price range and when ordered it arrived on time and good order. Would order from again. Thank you very much
2,Nice scenes but that is about all,There is some very pretty scenery but I did not like the actual movie. It did not flow & did not have the funny parts like the previous Pirates movies.
5,Great installment to a great series,"This is a fantastic movie. It's the first installment of a new direction the series is taking. I really like the new characters. The new romance is much more interesting than William Turner and Elizabeth Swan. In this movie, we have a chaplain and a mermaid. Who'd of thunk it? There's a lot of escaping, capturing, escaping, and capturing in this movie. But that's what you expect in POTC. Plenty of action and plenty of character development. This villain, Blackbeard, is more complex than just some scary bad guy like Davy Jones. I very much like the main themes of redemption and salvation. I cannot say this is the best installment of the series, but it's in the top two."
2,"Pirates of the Carribean, On Stranger Tides.","I won't say it stunk,. I won't say it was lousey, but I will say, I'm sorry I wasted my money to buy it and even sorrier I wasted my time watching it.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (Five-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)"
4,Enjoyable Film,"I have seen all three previous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, which were outright enchanting and entertaining. When watching ""On Stranger Tides,"" I felt a bit of disappointment of the fact that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were no longer presented in the film, but I came to the realization that their characters had had completed their stories, so to speak.Admittedly, ""On Stranger Tides"" by itself is an entertaining film to watch. It's an interesting story of the adventure to find the Fountain of Youth and the encounter with the infamous pirate Blackbeard (played by Ian McShane). It was really a good movie to watch. What really gave me nightmares were the mermaids. I actually thought all mermaids were ""good"" and ""lovely"" but not man-eating creatures. Now I learnt a very important lesson from this film: stay away from mermaids.All in all, it's an enjoyable film."
5,best pirate actors,depp was made to play jack sparrow each movie great he gets funnier and sexier each time love this series of movies thumps up!
4,September 19th is talk like a pirate day- FYI,"The 4th movie in the series, this movie breaks away with some of the other major characters missing (Elizabeth Swan, and her beau) but introduces one major new character,,,,,Edward Teach (or Thatch depending on which persons doing the recording) also known as Blackbeard the Pirate."
4,Johnny Depp delivers more of that naughty playful charm each movie,"I let my heart get turned towards Johnny Depp in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and fell hopelessly in love in Benny and Joon. It is his naughty playful charm that is so uniquely his that he develops and delivers better with each movie. Jack Sparrow must have been created to epitomize that trait to be played with abandon and no holds barred. In this Part 4 sequel, he is more coy and playful with his naughty charm. Penelope Cruz was perfectly cast for him to spar with. All of us need a little bit of pirate in our lives."
3,FLICKING 3D,"the movie itself was awesome, however i bought the 3d/blue ray version to go with my new 3d computer, and every 5 seconds the 3d would flicker in and out. Very annoying and hard to focus on the quality of the movie this way, kind of disappointed in the 3d genre as a result altogether."
3,The worst of all the franchise,"At least Depp returns and thats it, the other actors are gone now. That makes the film a bummer cause I liked Keira and Orlando."
3,Gas,"Watching this was like passing terrible gas. Seriously, like terribbbbble gas. Pirates of the Caribbean as a franchise is like going through severe bowel movements when you like a girl and the chic scares the hell out of you. The kind that takes one to the emergency room for further evaluation."
4,GReat Movie - Sad Features,I love the movies - and this one was such a breath of fresh air as opposed to the last two.The color and sound on this collection were superb. The only complaint I have it that they are FORCING you to by the 5-disc combo to get any REAL features. Bad Disney. Do we REALLY need 3 different versions of the movie. Is 3D really taking off as they had hoped? Me hears not. But Oh well. I'll watch the pricing on the 5-disc combo and maybe get it on sale during the holiday season.
2,"Out of all 4, this is the worst","I was not thrilled with this movie at all- basically it was the same old, same old but with Blackbeard and his daughter rather than Elizabeth and Will Turner-it was actually boring."
2,Not Worth Purchasing,"Saw the movie in 3D at a local theater. Although a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, this one left me flat. Actually could not wait until it was over. Some parts were good and interesting, but for the most part would not add it to my collection."
2,They PIRATED me out of a decent package!!!!!!,"I now have all of the PIRATE movies, but interesting how the greedy pirates at Disney decided that in order to sell their 3D version, they would add a bonus blu ray disc with extras to the package but NOT give one to those of us who only bought the blu ray (and really don't need the regular DVD they stuck in there).AND THEY LIED ON THE ADVERTISEMENT (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo). That adds up to 3 discs to me. And here I am, stuck with a purchase that I have spent over $20+ at Amazon, and it turns out I'm buying based on what the add says, and wind up with a version that Disney has sneaked out under false pretenses. The movie is fine, the blu-ray is crisp and clean and the sound is great....but all of my other Pirate movies (pre-3D)have a movie disc and a bonus disc, both in blu-ray, and no need to stick in the dvd. Anyone want to start a complaint group? I want to get what was advertised and that's all. Yo ho indeed......"
3,Is this review for the movie itself or for the Blue-ray disk quality?,"I am really confused since last time I checked the Blu-ray won't come out until in 2 weeks and people have been reviewing it since May. If you want to review a movie, there is a website ""IMDB.COM"" if you happen not to know.Bear with me but I give it a 3 star so that it won't ruin either sides."
1,DVD vs. Blue-ray,"I have no problem with you giving it a one star review. Maybe if more people did and it didn't sell as well, Disney would be less money hungry and realease both the blue-ray and the regular DVD at the same time. How dare they try to force the consumer's hand by using such underhanded tactics."
1,Worst Movie,The Worst ever made. Dont buy it not worth it at all. We should get are money back not worth it at all.
3,Long and drawn out but more fun than the third,"The first movie was fun, the second okay, and the third just plain dull. This one drags on far too long with a search for the fountain of youth and a mermaid's tear, but it has a good deal more humor than #3 and is mostly entertaining to watch."
3,"Light-years ahead of ""At World's End""","I'll admit--POTC 3 left me with quite the bitter taste in my mouth as I excited the theater. Days later, critics were screaming for the saga to end as a trilogy, and at the time, I was inclined to hop on this bandwagon. But then I stopped, and realized that redemption was needed for Pirates. I'm not sure if ""On Stranger Tides"" has accomplished this, but it's a start. No Keira Knightley; no Orlando Bloom? So freaking what?! Penelope Cruz was a nice addition. Ian McShane did a great job as Blackbeard. Geoffrey Rush needed more screen time as Hector Barbossa, and the Spanish were shamefully skimmed over. The mermaids were annoying, though. Particularly Serena.Hopefully ""Pirates 5"" will be a vast improvement. HOPEFULLY."
4,Entertaining!,One of the more entertaining Pirates movies to be released. I missed Elizabeth and Will but Captain Jack lived up to expectations. Johnny Depp is a very talented actor who was allowed to showcase his abilities.
4,It's not the best in the series,"It's not the best movie in this series, but then again they took a children's authors story about a different character and adapted it to make it into a Jack Sparrow story, rather than write something original based more in the previously laid down material.Still it has it's moments of humor, slapstick and cameos. Watch it with a not too critical eye and sharing a bottle of wine and it's a good entertainment."
3,OK movie,The first Pirates movie is the best and there is no argument about that. The second was not as good and the third was even worse. The fourth is somewhere between the second and third. The story is pretty bad and doesn't make much sense. Captain Jack is the only likeable character and everyone else is pretty nonexistent. I would not buy this for full price because it is not worth it. This movie felt like a cash in and the story should have been rewritten or let the franchise die.
5,Like a comfortable old pair of shoes,"What do the critics know? If critics pan a film it makes me want to see for myself even more.Johnny Depp and some of the old cast do not disappoint here. Granted; Jack Sparrow is looking long in the tooth these days (who doesn't!)but it's a hard life being the worlds greatest Pirate! Geoffrey Rush is in his usual fine form as his his character Barbossa which I personally think could and should be some sort of spinoff! (Are you listening Disney?) Ian McShane doesn't steal the show but fits right in as though he was born for the role, and narry a curse word used. Penelope Cruz was a fresh breath of air. We missed Ms. Knightley, but life goes on. We were disappointed with one thing though...the monkey only had a cameo!5 Stars!When is the next one?"
3,Not Too Bad,"Not The Best In The Series, But The 3D Version Helped Keep Me Interested. I would recommend this movie only in 3D."
4,Johnny Depp is a great character actor.,"You can depend on Depp to fulfill his role and it is a pleasure to watch his movies. My husband watches all of the ""pirate"" movies . . . repeatedly"
3,Ok - Not great,Usual PotC stuff. I felt boring sitting through some of the parts of the movie. I brought this as I am building my BR library
4,A fun ride,"I thought this movie was quite enjoyable. It didn't have a fantastic story, but it was fun. It's been a while since I've seen the 2nd and 3rd movies in the franchise, but I felt more of a desire to rewatch this film than the third, for what that's worth."
3,Ok I guess,"I love almost any decently made action movie, but the first movie in this series was the best and the rest are just okay."
5,Way better than 2 or 3,Not sure why I heard so many mediocre reviews of the 4th installment of PoTC. I thought it was far better than the 2nd and 3rd movies.
4,Another Pirates,"A good episode, but not my favorite. Didn't build as much on the characters' unique personalities like the other movies did."
3,Pretty forgettable film,"I'm writing this now about 2 weeks after watching, and really am finding nothing memorable about the entire film. Lots of action in the first half, then settling into dialog and story more in the second half, then more action at the end. The entire ending was predictable as far as what happened, but the one saving grace was to (SPOILER) leave the girl stranded on the island, much as Captain Jack was in the first film...with one shot and one bullet...which she promptly used to shoot at him. I would have like to know more about the mermaids and just exactly why the seemed more like swimming vampires than evil women with fins. I didn't mind the 3rd film, but found myself wandering away mentally from this one quite often. The quality of the Blu-Ray was fine, but I wouldn't go and spend a pirate's booty on it."
3,the series is getting tired...,Depp is always entertaining but without the original cast from the first two (Bloom & Knightly)some of the magic is missing... entertaining none the less for something mindless to watch.
4,MISSING 2 VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE,"I AM A DEVOTED JOHNNY DEPP FAN AND LOVE THIS SERIES, BUT I REALLY MISSED KNIGHTLY AND BLOOM, DON'T REALLY CARE FOR PENELOPE CRUZ."
3,great movie,great movie but where the other disc and did waste the case before sent it? sure look that way. but movies great over all
4,Better than I expected,This sequel was much better than the previous. The plot was more interesting than the last movie. The script is a lot better as well. I was surprised to see the improvement.
1,Who ever wrote this would have done better to vomit on The franchise.,"Horrid and nonsensical.Not even a good light action film. Bad dialog, Penelope Cruz is not even attractive as a Pirate lady.The cinematography was close cropped to clearly avoid set design, and locations.The pirate song theme was so recycled I actually don't want to hear it again.I don't know how Johnny Depp made this film without choking."
1,Pirates Please Stop.......,"I loved the first couple of films, but at this point, please stop making them. I just feel like its all been done. There's nothing new, nothing to further the story, and quite frankly the acting is a snooze fest. I love Johnny Depp and I totally get they are throwing a boat load of money at him, but this has seriously given me pause when I consider going to see him in any film at the local cineplex."
1,not good to watch on PC,"When I purchased this, I did not know that it was an on-line movie.I thought I was buying the actual CD/VHS."
1,PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN ON STRANGER TIDES,"FOR SOME REASON THIS ITEM SEEMED TO BE A BOOTLEG DVD. IT SHOULD OF BEEN A BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO, BUT I ONLY RECIEVED ONE DISK WHICH SHOWS AS A DVD, WITH A BLU-RAY LABLE ON IT! THE COVER WAS NOT AUTHENTIC AS WELL! IT LOOKED MADE UP, OR PRINTED! I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TOP ENJOY THIS ITEM! HORRIBLE SELLER!!!"
1,Please replace: audio and video are not in sync.,"The audio and video are not in sync. We would like a replacement, but have no idea how to proceed."
1,Anyone Who Had Anything To Do With This Turkey Walks The Plank!!,"Hideous! Watched it only because there was nothing better and it was a first run movie.I have nothing against gays, but Depp was so flamingly foppish and swishy I thought he'd break into a tune from ""Bird Cage"" just any second! Depp has NOTHING going for him if he isn't in wild makeup and weird hats.No, really, think about it. Can anyone say ""The Tourist""? No hats, no makeup and there was no ""there"" there.There was no ""there"" there in the actress who played the captured mermaid, no there there with the wishy-washy actor who replaced Orlando. Zimmer's magnificent score from POTC-1 just degraded all the way down to this sequel. He seems tired too. Come to think of it, EVERY one was tired and only phoned in their performances and cashed the big checks.Time to find another ride to raid, Disney! Maybe The Haunted House, It's A Small World, I don't know, just PLEASE, no more pirate movies!"
4,Get the Blu-Ray,Better than the last Pirates movie but definitely get the Blu-Ray as the sound and picture quality are far superior.
3,good...but not the best,"Watching Johnny Depp, you can sense that he is tired of playing this part. Thereis less glitter in his eyes as the previous pirate movies.But with the boatload of money Disney has, this sequel was done and it doeslook pretty with great sets, mermaids and other goodies. I did watch it andat some level it did entertain me but im really glad that i only rented it."
2,Phoning it in and a waste of time,"Honestly I did not expect much from this movie.I watched to see Penelope Cruz.Not much of a story line , Typical special effects.Johnny Depp is just phoning in the lines anymore.They should definitely stop making these."
3,awesome movie but false advertising.,Really good movie. Everything was good with it except i pre ordered this movie and they guaranteed that if i pre ordered this movie the price would be lower than the price of it when it comes out in stores. And so i bought it for 24.99 and now the price for it in the store is 24.99! That's false advertising!!
3,Better but not quite there,"I, like many others, absolutely loved the first Pirates movie. And Jack Sparrow, of course. I really enjoyed the second movie too... HATED the third. This was a slight return to form. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is as entertaining as ever. I didn't really miss Keira and Orlando, and thought Sam Claflin and the mermaid were a fresh replacement. I didn't think Penelope added too much interest. Overall, it captures the Pirates spirit, but doesnt quite reclaim its former glory."
2,Very Disappointing!,"First off, I am a HUGE Pirates fan. I've seen part 3 at least 15 times (6 in the theater), so I was chomping at the bit for this one to come out! Unfortunately, this movie was barely entertaining. For one thing, why Disney chose to put Penelope Cruz in anything even remotely kid-friendly is beyond me. She has been in several soft-core porn movies and is only a half-baked actress to boot. Practically the entire movie was filmed on either an island or in England, and desperately lacked good ""piratey"" action. There were only a few original cast members in this movie, and Elizabeth and Will were sorely missed.This is by far the worst of the series and (I can't believe I'm saying this)I doubt I will even purchase it."
2,Put The CD Back Down...,"What really got me to buy this CD was her song ""Crush"", which I heard on Soul Train. To me, that is one of the only good songs. I'm just glad it was only 6 dollars... I was expecting much more, like more songs like ""Crush"", but I didn't get them.In my personal opinion, the only good songs are ""Crush"", ""Feel Good Song"", ""This Could Be Love"", ""Solo Star"", and ""Ain't No Way""... so in my personal opinion, you should just download the whole CD and burn it...I only gave it 2 stars because of the few decent songs on the album.Don't waste your money... keep trying, Solange."
2,THE ALBUM IS TERRIBLE!,IT IS NO DOUBT THAT SOLANGE HAS TALENT BUT THIS ALBUM SOUNDS TERRIBLE. IT SOUNDS AS IF SHE JUST WENT INTO THE STUDIO AND THREW SOMETHING TOGETHER IN 5 MINUTES. THERE IS ONLY 3 DECENT SONGS ON THE WHOLE ALBUM. SHE SHOULD HAVE PUT A LITTLE MORE EFFORT INTO THIS ALBUM. HOPEFULLY HER SECOND ALBUM WILL BE BETTER.
3,Really 2 1/2 But Whatever,"She Can Sing That I'll Give Her... But Nowhere Near The Level Of Beyonce. She Is Backed By Weak Song Writing And Horrible Production... This Is Something 2 Stay Away From. She Need Some Time To Mature.Good Songs (4-5 Stars Songs)Crush, Ain't No Way, This Songs For YouOK Songs (3 1/2 - 3 Star Songs)Get Together, Feel Good Love, WonderlandBad Songs (2 1/2 - 1 Star Songs)Feelin You Pt 2 F/ Noreaga, Dance With Me F/ B2K, So Be It, True Love F/ Lil Romeo, Feelin You Pt 1, Just Like You, Thinkin About You F/ Murphy Lee, Solo Star, I Used To, Sky Away, Naive F/ Beyonce And Da Brat, Feelin You Wreckshop Remix.That Sums It Up For Now... Any Comments Instant Message Me At My AOL Screen Name MIM2STCCFS"
1,Solo Star !,"I think the title of this album says it, all one solitary star is all this gets, and that's only cos big sis saved it at the end!My gosh, I also picked this up for 99p and thought well why not see what this is like, I am glad I didn't pay more than 99p for this but then, I could have bought a hamburger or something. The album is terrible. The singing is awful, the production is good but with her vocals over them they just die. I personally would not even reccommend downloading the tracks, trust me you're better off without this in your life!"
1,It hasn't grown on me yet,"It is an eclectic endevor ,no doubt, and I admire her effort simply for that reason. I have listened to the album several times, in hopes of developing a liking for ""Solo Star"" but to no avail, I simply end up disliking it even more. Listen to it real good before you buy it (If you can) so that can you possibly save yourself some money."
3,What are people talking about!,"First, I would like for y'all to stop dissing my girl Solange. Just because she is Beyonce's sister doesn't mean anything. Solange and her oldest sister are both true musicians. They both write their own songs. Oh and yeah Solange helped co-write two songs on Destiny's Child new album ""Destiny's Fulfilled"" and co-wrote the title track on Kelly Rowland's CD."
1,"Now, now, people...","...Even though we can agree that this album is a waste of time and money, we must remember that Solange has a purpose in the music industry: she paved the way for current sister/leech/""singers"" like Trashlee Simpson and Hilary Duff's sister. That being said, I'm not disappointed in this album because I didn't expect it to be good. I found it in the Bargain Bucket at Peppermint records for 25 cents. I bought it because my dorm had a secret Santa pool and I drew the name of someone I didn't care for. I listened to it first because, well, I didn't like the gift recipient enough to give her something brand new. The moral of this story is, if you like some of the songs on this album, download them. Otherwise, buy them in a store for less than the cost of a package of ramen noodles. Don't feel bad that you're not paying much money for it; Solange's kid will probably be put through college by Aunt Beyonce."
2,standing in the shadow,Of course Solange will always be compared with Beyonce - and with this CD she cant stand competition. It's more teenage pop than anything else. A scooby do song and a rapper who sticks out more on her record than herself....bubble gum pop-soul...that's it.
2,beyonce's sister steps up in the game,"if you're 14 get this nothing really makes me wanna buy this cd features lame cameos from b2k, and noreaga still it's not the best and just more commercial garbage put out for profit pass please."
3,I like this cd but it was not that good,"Maybe it's just my age but this cd was defintely on the children's side. The Lyrics were very bubbly and kind of cheesy. And so were some of the beats.The songs I do like are Feelin You,Feel Good Song, Crush, SkyAway and Naive. The rest were just ok and some where really corny. I think this cd will only be appealing to Middle School girls. There are alot of tracks on this cd but more effort should have been put into the music and lyrics. Sorry Solange, I don't think your ready to go solo yet."
1,"NO,NO,NO,NO,NO",TeRrIbLe!!! Do not even get the 95 cent copy they are selling on Amazon.com. It is a complete waste of money. It is one of those cds where you say if It wasn't for her sister or her father she would have stayed undiscovered. I
3,DID ANYBODY EVEN KNOW THIS EXIST,not a bad cd if you'ere all on the destiny's child-beyonce banfwagon but a shame this was'nt promoted more but then again solange will alwayus follow b's shadow.
5,better than beyonce,i actually like this cd....its real nice...its good for teenagers...i like this cd more than i like listening to beyonce cd!
3,PRETTY GOOD...,i actually listen to solange cd..online before it came out in stores..and i wasn't really impressed..but i decided to buy it since it was only 8.99..and i actually like it even more when i listened to it more and more..Solange has a average voice..to me..but the material is right for her voice..although is was a couple of tracks she could have left off..overall is a GOOD(average) cd..although i don't see the comparision with her and beyonce..i actually like her voice better..and she seems real mature and different for her age...and that's what's kool about her to me..maybe since i am only 18..and a teen myself..THE STANDOUTS TRACKS TO ME ARE:1.Ain't No Way2.Crush3.So Be It(my favorite)4.True Love5.This Could Be Love6.Solo Star7.Sky Away8.This Song's For You9.Naive*I recommend this cd if you like Teen RNb music and can relate to it..or just like Rnb music period..
4,Solange is a star!,"The music and her voice go hand and hand. She also features N.O.R.E.,B2K, LiL' Romeo,Murphy Lee and you also hear her big sister Beyonce. She is a very talented young lady.The CD is refreshing."
1,"""THIS MUST BE CORINA #2""","There are no samples to determine if this is the same CORINA. Plus she totally doesn't look like CORINA of ""TEMPTATION"" fame. I'll buy it and give it a try. Usually, I'm pleasantly surprised when I listen to something new. I cannot rate this 'cause I know nothing of it and Amazon's rating system has no coice for 0; so I had to put 1 down. For all of you music lovers, open yourselves to something new- you all maybe pleasantly surprised! -JULIUS-ALLAN"
1,Not a self study book,"From the very first page in a chapter it starts with full devanagari text and no accompanying translation. The text ends abruptly to a glossary of the terms used. Then, it goes on like a vocabulary notebook that you'd keep in your pocket to memorize phrases. There are some exercises at the end of every chapter but no answer keys. This repeats in all the chapters.Overall, if you study in the course with the author in the University in person, it may help. If you are looking for something for self-study to bridge the gap between beginner and intermediate level, dump this book. You're as good as the day you completed your beginner's course.It just doesn't bridge the gap between beginner and intermediate level."
4,Good comparison between different flavours of Unix,I work with a couple of flavours of unix and find that some basic things slip through the cracks sometimes. I found that this book is great to refresh my mind on some of the differances between them and also simple things like the names of various utilities. Overall a good book if you want dabble in a Unix that you are not familiar with.
4,A good all-round UNIX reference,"I use various flavours of UNIX (including Linux) and have found this book useful and well organised. It took me a while to find a concise reference which manages to direct one in the right direction, even if the exact solution isn't available. Ideal for people tampering with various UNIX systems simultaneously."
1,Terrible wiper blade,"Absolutely terrible. I replace my many-years old rear wiper blade; and it worked better than the Bosch Hindsight Rear Wiper did out of the box. The Hindsight smears like crazy for the first 20(ish) wipes. I've cleaned it, etc., and it isn't a long term solution. It seems like the blade quickly develop a film (as in weeks) and it needs to be wiped off before it will work properly again."
2,not working well for us,"We have Bosch Evolution series wipers for the front, and they are absolutely wonderful. These, not so much. I give it two stars instead of one only because we've never had good luck finding good blades for the rear, and I'm wondering if it could be the window itself. That said, these are worse than most of the others we've tried. There have to be better ones out there."
2,Songs in Sign,"I returned the book as well as another book, Signing for Kids because I do not like them so to speak. This book does not include American Sign Language and there aren't many songs in the book."
2,"Great when it works, terrible warantee and support","I would like to throw this LCD out.Be warned that Sceptre does NOT stand behind their LCDs and have a crummy very limited 1 year warantee.Most important about Sceptre's poor support is that their policy is that NO MATTER HOW MANY PIXELS ARE BURNT OUT OR BROKEN, THEY WILL NOT FIX IT OR CONSIDER IT A DEFECT. yOU'RE STUCK WITH IT !!If you get a perfect one, hope it stays that way, if not, you're stuck.To me, support and a companies backup of a product says everything about them."
5,Mallaportinment,"I am writing my tesis about Mallaportioment, probabily in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Now Iam working in some aspects of the effects from mallaportionment to representation (Number of parties, magnitude size, formulaic structure, dispropotionality). All this issues in Argentina Electoral system. It is an quasiexperimental work, with reapportionment simulations, meanwhile the electoral outcomes are constants.Your work interest me.."
5,Contents,"navajo weavingits technic and its historycharles a amsdenFIRST SOFTCOVER EDITION 1990Detailed and comprehensive study of the techniques of primitive weaving, from the building of the loom with materials at hand to the cleaning, carding and handling the raw wool from the sheared sheepIt is a remarkable accounting of a primitive people developing a most sophisticated skill.At the time this book was first published in 1934, no non-Navajo Indian or Whiteman had ever developed the ability so beautifully displayed in this extraordinary art form.No book has ever so carefully described this most ancient of crafts. Heavily illustrated. 7 color plates of masterpieces. Bibliography. Index. 460 pages."
5,Original Peanuts pieces,"This is the real deal -- the original Vince Guaraldi score we all remember from the Peanuts TV series, including 'Cast Your Fate to the Wind' and 'Linus and Lucy' plus Guaraldi's arrangements of traditional tunes like 'O Tannenbaum' and 'Greensleeves.' Transcriptions include Vince's sparing but very jazzy, chord-based pseudo-improvisations. Intermediate level. Good value!"
5,GREAT,I absolutely LOVE Vince Guaraldi's work and have always wanted to play the REAL version. The fact that this is a great real exact perfect transcription is amazing. It is a pleasure to play.
4,4 Star Essential Rating-But Their 2nd Release Is Godly!!,"I gave this 4 stars because it is a must own. It does have everything that most power metal outfits have: thundering double bass, super fast riffs, smooth vocals; but, they stamp their own sound into it all, which is why it's not just another debut from another power metal band. Every song pretty much stays in the others tradition; in a starnge way, this whole CD could have been one massively long, concept track, if the band opted to go that route. It belongs in your CD rack for the most important reason: after you hear their next one, Prophet of Evil, you won't believe how this band progressed in MAJOR way, and it would be ridiculous not to own this one with it. Check out Prophet of Evil, which also can be bought on here. I haven't heard their 3rd release yet, but I can only imagine. A must have for any fans of Stratovarius, HammerFall, Dream Evil, and Domine. **** 4 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF POWER METAL! Cheers."
4,Oh behave!,"This was groovy baby, yeah! i luved mike myers as dr.evil, especially his little pinky finger position. i would have given this a five, but it was a little 2 nasty at some parts. anyway,if u wanna laugh a lot an cry a little, then austin powers is the movie 4 u!"
5,"This is a preemprtive ""shh"". THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!","The lines are the best. Although the average person may think this movie to be somewhat silly, it is those of who enjoy a good spoof that will take it for what it is meant to be, FUNNY!! Mike Myers is great in this and So I Married an Ax Murderer. I highly recommend both."
1,I Don't Get It!!!,"I did like the ""oh behave"" thing, but other than that it is just plain silly and stupid, baby."
4,"A clever, but often spohmoric spoof of 60's spy films.","Mike Meyers has a dual role as Austin ""Danger"" Powers and his nemisis Dr. Evil, both cryogenically frozen in the late 1960s. Each of these characters is worth the price alone. Austin is hysterical with his free-love attitude and ineptness. As the recently unfrozen Dr Evil, Meyers shines. 90 minutes is the perfect length for this, as it tends to grow a bit old. However, Dr. Evil's speech in the therapy group is THE highlight. END"
1,I really need help,"I just do not get it. At all. And I have agood sense of humor. But whta is funny about a horny guy with bad teeth who has the IQ level of toothpaste? Seth Green is hot, so I saw the movie five times. But I still dont see the funny part!! Help me understand this mystery. What is sof unny about campy body jokes and sexually insulting gags? Who watches this stuff? NOT Groovy, baby. Not even OK"
1,Just Say NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"This was not a funny movie. I am very sorry to say this, because Seth Green is in it, and I love him so much. But this movie is not funny.I saw the movie three times. Everyone else loved it, so I concluded I have a bad sense of humor. But then it hit me... This movie is just not funny!I am not going to insult all the people that love this movie, because people do that to me and I hate it. I will merely write this review and give you weird looks at the video store."
2,Wow! Dumb at it's best!,"Come on people behind this movie, we need it to be some what funny.This was such a good idea, but you stopped writing when it started forming into a good movie. It's biggest problem is how gross it is. Takes away from the movie to the point that you don't care what is going on anymore. Mike is a wonderful talent, and the characters are so-so, but a really good script is needed. Disappointment. Followed by the equally dumb ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"""
5,"An excellent movie, that's clear, fun and a bunch of laughs","This movie is great! An excellent acheivement, It's hilarious, funny, and uses a lot of scenes that have set precedents in the world of comedy. I think this movie is just hilarious using a lot of play on words, and a lot of tiny but phony jokes tied in with hilarious props and phrases. The plot of the movie is interesting, and the characters are funny, and very real. The menu uses an interesting song function, as with alternate endings to the movie, an eye-catching chapter list, and a lot of fun stuff, including a commentary with mike myers and the director. My favorite scene is the group therapy, Dr. Evil (played by mike Myers) tells of his life. I laugh thinking about it everyday. I own a lot of DVD movies, and I think this is the funniest, and best one I own. ""Yeah, Baby!"" END"
5,Never gets old,"This movie makes me laugh every time I see it, which has been quite a few times. In my opinion it is a true classic."
4,Austin Powers dvd,This is a great start in the series. Mike Myers is hilarious as many people in it. I wish he'd do another.
1,Austin Powers is a hungry hippo!,"This movie, without a doubt, is the worst biography I have ever seen.Written by, The Lovely Flavious Fruit the V"
1,"If you are shallow and mindless, you will enjoy this movie.",It is 2004 and even today there are movies like this that protray women as being mindless sex objects which is disgusting. The plot is inane. I can see how this movie will be appealing to [...] teenagers and depraved adults.
5,One of the best movies of the 90s,"I saw this film and was amazed, I couldn't wait for it to be released so I bought a rental version. Now it is avaliable on DVD I am about to buy it. If you haven't seen it you must have been frozen for the last 30 years (well, not 30)."
4,"very funny, very charming, hopeful","mike myers is a genius, he brings to life a character who is unique and delightful. there is actually a plot in here and some of the jokes are fall out of your chair funny. this movie and powers himself grow on you. you miss him when the movie ends.I hope myers does lots of sequels"
5,The best film EVER!,"This film is just brilliant, and although slightly crude at times is still extremely funny. I'm from the UK and haven't seen the sequel yet, but when it comes out on vid, I'll hire it straight away. Elizabeth Hurley does a brilliant role in being a smart up-to-date girl, and Myers is even better in playing Dr. Evil and Austin Powers. Although I am a ten year old (look at the bad reviews below)I know that people of all ages love it, including my parents. This film is just totally SHAGADELIC baby yeah!"
3,Austin Powers... yeah baby!,"This movie launched a thousand catchphrases which meant everytime you walked down the street some irritating kid was yelling ""yeah baby yeah!"", it made me feel sick. After three months of counselling I've finally got over it, during my troubled three months I managed to watch Austin Powers a dozen times and laugh louder each viewing. It's one of those strange videos that is best viewed with a bunch of friends, and always good for filling 30 minutes of spare time you may have between working and attending therapy. One small note though: Austin Power's 2 is a lot better!"
2,Dumb and dumb,"Everybody seems to love Austin Powers. I just don't see it myself. A number of cute moments, but a lot more misses than hits for me. Maybe I needed to have been alive in the 60's to have gotten it. Then again my mother didn't get it very much either, much to my chagrin."
5,This DVD Rules!!!!!,This is a must have DVD if you own a DVD player. The menu at the beginning gives you many options and It is just great!!!!!!!
5,Best DVD quality I have seen.,"This DVD is the best DVD I have seen when it comes to the technical parts of it. There are a lot of extras that usually do not come with most DVDs and it has a few cool features, like deleted scences and things like that. The menu screen has a really cool moving graphic in the background, but the neatest feature I have seen is in the chapter selection menu. Every square that represents a particular chapter is animated. It actually plays the scene all the way through (IF you want to sit there and watch it) with no audio of course. The directors and Mike Myers commentary shows a lot of aspects of the movie that you would not see my just normal viewing. Overall it is what DVD viewing should be like across the board."
4,An excellent movie plus some great extras.,"Of course the movie itself is hilarious, but this DVD is also one of the best I own in terms of bonus materials. The deleted scenes are really funny, and this is probably the only place you'll ever get to see them. I also like the commentary track. Definitely worth your money."
2,Austin Powers,This movie was not good at all Mike Myers did a smashing job of playing both Austin Powers and Doctor Evil This story was really entertaining The best characherhad to be austin Powers played by Mike Myers The movie was a little boring in places I would give this movie a 10 out of ten All I can say is this movie was Groovy baby.
1,Stupit is the word to describe it.,Austin Powers is one of those rediculous farces out there that don't make any sense. The plot is just too stupit and only 12 year old would find this funny. This movie is stupit all it is it's a wierd looking Mike Myers and some other wierd guys and some hot chicks in some really rediculous plot. That is really what this movie adds up to. If you want a good Mike Myers film check out Waynes World at least that was funny. This was a mess and stupit and once again everybody loved it Why? Because everyone else liked it!
3,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"A spy from the 60's named Austin Powers, gets frozen and wakes up in the 90's. It's then that he must continue to fight his enemy Dr. Evil. Mike Myers does a good job playing both Austin Powes and Dr. Evil. However the film gets way to crude at times. Unfortunatly I guess most people like that kind of humor."
5,"The grooviest movie of all time, baby, yeah!","This is the funniest move. I have seen it more times then Mike Myers says ""Yeah Baby!"" and I still get a kick out of every brittish-accented sylibol he says!"
3,It's Shagadelic!,"In the movie, Austin Powers-International Man of Mystery, Mike Myers plays a ""frozen science experiment"" in the 60's. Myers plays all of the main characters in the play, including Austin Powers and ""Dr. Evil."" Austin Powers wakes to find himself in an entirely different world from the one he is used to. When Dr. Evil, an old nemesis of Powers, plans to take over the world(for, at first only $100,000), Austin Powers and his new-found love, attempt to ruin his plans for world domination. If you have a twisted mind, and a sick sense of humor, this film is definitely one not to miss."
5,cult movie,"Like ""Animal House"", ""The Blues Brothers"", ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", this is a cult movie. It is plot-less, is a parody, and has great lines. And those who find the ex-based humor insulting are just taking themselves too seriously."
5,Yeah Baby!,"Simply put FUNNY, Yes it's childish and has humor for kids, but isn't that why you watch a movie?"
4,"The 1997,1998,and1999 top 3 videos","Here is my own report card of 3 movies 1997 1 1998 1 1999 1. They are....... 1997 Austin Powers A plus , 1998 Antz A plus , and finaly .... 1999 Tarzan F plus. But My Favrote one is Austin Powers . In Fact It is halareais By, M.J.R."
5,SMASHING BABY!!!!!,"Austin Powers is one my favorite movies of all times... it's one of those movies i can watch countless times and never grow tired of it... I love all of mike myers movies. but this one has to be his best... also, this is one of the few movies that has a sequel to match the hiliarity of it's predecessor....GROOVY BABY, YEAH!!!!From the soundtrack to the costumes to the shagadelic hip lines of the movie, this movie deserves ten stars plus."
4,A Great Value,"This disc is jam-packed with just about everything a videophile could want in a DVD title. Austin Powers contains both full and wide screen versions, some great audio commentary from Myers and director Jay Roach, deleted scenes, a music video, theatrical trailers, biographies, filmographies, a 60's spy film retrospective, and even ""Star Highlights"" which highlight brief video clips from some of the actors' other Time Warner movies (My favorite was a titilating scene in Dangerous Ground with Elizabeth Hurley.Although not everyone will find Mike Myers' sense of humor as funny as I, it's hard to knock a DVD with so many outstanding features.Recommended END"
1,groovy?,The story is hell when you have to write a paper linking Austin to Bernard Marx from brave new world.
1,Low-class humor,"ugh, this movie is so unbelievable stupid, i am not aware of how someone could sit through this movie, and remain awake, or if not sound asleep, they'd probably be holding down the vomit in their throats...this is the kind of perverted movie that is ruining todays theaters."
1,this movie sucks,i thought i seen worser movies but this one is the worst ever. MIKE MYERS does not deserve to be an actor.
1,What a offensive movie!,"As a girl, (duh a female) I found this movie hugely offensive. For the mental producer to portray women as sex objects, ""shagadelic babies"" is just downright immoral. Why doesn't someone make a movie with girls portrayed as pervs., and then see how guys respond?"
2,Beware! R1 dvd is heavily cut!!!,"first things first. this dvd is cut heavily! The Christian Slater ""orange sherbert"" scene is completely gone, and 2 scenes which were in the original, complete cut (the 'henchmans wife' and the 'bucks party' scenes) are cut and placed in the deleted scenes section!This cut of the movie is shocking, if you want to buy Austin powers on dvd, please steer clear of the R1, and buy the full version which has not been butchered. I wish someone had told me before i wasted my money on this very substandard dvd.You have been warned!"
4,Silly but enterteaining,"The star of the Austin Powers' series, is just a fun movie, do not search for a profound message underneath the jokes. Just relax and enjoy, that's what it was made for."
3,"Good Features, but the Film is Cut...","Austin Powers is undoubtedly one of the funniest films of the 90's. However the film on this DVD is cut. Offered as Deleted Scenes, the cuts were part of the film when screened and released in Australia. The Region 4 release of Austin Powers has all the features of this release and the film is uncut.I recommend the movie, but not this DVD."
2,"Boneheaded, but at least it has Elizabeth Hurley!","I can hardly believe it, but I flushed 90 minutes of my life down the toilet watching this piece of utter trash. This film is an insult to one's intelligence.Still, it features the fabulous Elizabeth Hurley. I'd be willing to watch paint dry, if said paint were drying on Elizabeth Hurley. Even so, for Hurley-gazing one would be better off watching the no less execrableBedazzled."
2,"1st in the series of 3, my least favorite","I think the best was part 2 in this series of 3 movies, but of course you need to see the first to understand the rest!"
5,This is one of the best comedies ever!,I've seen this movie about 30 times total. No matter how much I watch it it is still funny. Mike Myers does a fantastic job playing both Austin Powers and Dr.Evil. This is his best movie ever. I would recommend this to people who liked his other movies and SNL because it is the same kind of humor. Don't miss this one!
4,A cheesy yet well-done DVD conversion of a hilarious comedy.,"The extras on this package are lots of fun. Most of the deleted scenes are funny, but some fall short, like the new endings. As well as new scenes there's a whole lot of other junk that's vaguely amusing, but the really cool part is the voice over commentary by the director, Jay Roach, and Mike Myers himself. It's a silent version of the movie, but with Mike in the left audio channel and Jay in the right, and they discuss the film and talk about various happenings that occured whilst filming. Amusing, yet it's hard not to feel like a big loser as you watch it, because you realize that you're just listening to someone else's conversation, and it makes you feel a little pathetic. So watch it with a friend."
5,Smashing! You got my thumb up!,This was a great movie with great actors. With Mike Myers and Elizabeth Herley in the starring roles it has got to be great. The writing is excellent. Its a must see.
2,"I'm sorry, but maybe I shouldn't have seen the 2nd one first","I saw Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me the 1st day it came out (it was that or Star Wars and this was starting earlier.) I laughed my butt off, as I didn't know what to expect having never seen the 1st one. When I heard that the 1st one was better than the 2nd one, I went right over to my video store to rent it and perhaps later buy it. Thank god I rented it first. I am sorry, but this movie was a major dissapointment. Had I seen this beforehand I doubt I'd have seen the 2nd one. Both do have many of the same supporting characters, but this was kinda lacking something I'm afraid. There were some decent laughs in it, but save the money it would take to rent it and go to your cinema instead and see The Spy Who Shagged Me."
5,AUSTIN POWERS HE'S THE MAN.(oh.. I fell over.),As i was sitting in the movie theater I was regreating paying to watch this movie.As he acts like a total wanker at the start. I thourght it was going to be really pathetic. But I was wrong. It was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my life. I think everyone should see it.
4,"Like it, love it or Hate it?","What can I say... I used to watch the Three Stoges. I like Steve Martin. Umm, the first time I watched this... I was not too impressed. But, then a few days later, I was going around saying ""Grooovy Baby"", ""Let's Shag on my Shag"" and ""Shagadelic"". Anytime a movie leaves you with something that sticks with you like, ""I'll be Back"" or ""Make my Day""... then there must be something that connects. I am not a young person either. Well to make this short. I will definitely watch the new ""Spy who Shagged Me"". Austin (Myers)is taking comedy to new, albeit shagadelic heights. Watch this one and be prepared to Shaga,Shaga, ding dong."
4,"Full of quotable quotes (believe me, you'll quote)","If you're a highly conservative, or old fashioned, modest type, you should skip over this movie. But if you aren't, I guarentee you'll like it. I love Mike Myers, He does an awesome job in this movie and I'm really looking forward to the sequel, which, as you might know, has made more money in it's opening run then this movie made throughout the entire history of it! It goes to show that people liked this one enough to see the sequel! I guarentee laughs, even if it's just one. Don't miss it."
1,"Awful, Tasteless and Juvenile","I can understand this movie appealing to a 14 year old - that's about the level of immature ""humor"" that Austin Powers delivers. What I cannot understand is how seemingly intelligent and mature adults have become so enthusiastic about this tasteless exercise in sophomoric self-indulgence. It's a pity that the remake of The Avengers was such a failure; the original series succeeded at spoofing the James Bond genre with intelligence and wit. Austin Powers has neither.More the pity, the DVD edition is well packaged with lots of extras. What's not surprising is that the two alternative endings are no funnier or well written than the final version.With a sequel on its way to the theaters, keep the following in mind: Caveat Emptor!"
4,The Best of the Austin Powers Trilogy,"""Austin Powers"" is a marvelous send-up of the James Bond films of the 1960s and also pays tribute to all the trends of the era; for example, my favorite throw-away joke is seeing Andy Warhol, at the film's opening, contemplating a can of tomato soup.The humor centers around a time-lost swinger, attempting to adapt to a modern world in which the Russians are allies, nobody gives in to free love, and a higher degree of self-control and responsiblity is emphasized in society.The Dr. Evil segments are some of the funniest parts of the movie; I think the funniest scene is where Scott and Dr. Evil argue over the merits of allowing evil bass to eat Austin Powers, as oppossed to simply shooting him.I took off a star for scene where Austin Powers drowns a henchman in a toilet; I personnaly felt that the scene was thrown in for cheap laughs.The other two Austin Powers films are funny, but just can't compare to the original."
1,"Crude, disgusting, gross, ugly main character...",I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was DISGUSTING. I thought it had an awful dialouge and a really dumb plot. I honestly don't understand how it got to be so popular.
1,Sophomoric? Try 5th grader,"The only enjoyable seen was the opening seen a kind of large Bollywood dance scene. Th rest was utter garbage. I guess if you liked this movie maybe you should check out the Porkie's series, but then again you might have to ask your mom and dad for their video card, since I doubt any adult would want to view it again. Really, this was a baaaaad movie. The jokes weren't funny and the few gags that were not utterly stupid were repeated ad nauseum. It's not that I didn't 'get' the humor. I just don't think that juvenile bad sitcom type of humor is funny. Has America really sunk so low that this tripe is actually popular? Unbelievable."
1,Don't Hold Your BREATH!,"This movie is truly sad. If anyone is stupid enough to like it, then they deserve to watch this film. Austin Powers (Myers) is a horribly portrayed man of the 60s era. I believe that he throws girls arounds like ping pong balls. If you ask me, if you think Austin Powers is funny; Go buy a 747 and paint polka dots on it. Then, say oh behave, just so you can calm down. Then go off and marry Austin Powers because you are perfect for eachother."
1,awful!,"What a sad comment on our culture if we find garbage like this worthwhile. This is the equivalent of body-noise humor, set at a childish level. Anyone who likes this tripe should be emabarassed at their immaturity. Garbage packaged any way is still garbage. The directors and financiers of movies like this are counting on the utter stupidity of the public to spend money on junk like this. They laugh all the way to the bank, while fools line up to throw away their hard earned money on glaring stupidity like this movie."
4,Funny!,"Austin Powers is a very well done movie. It can get a little rough when Myers gets soft with Hurley. But I'll break it down.Ups:Dr. Evil makes the movie funny as heck.Spy spoof plot was well done.Lots of noticable, funny jokes.Downs:Hurley, though huge to the plot, is very annoying.Okay, so know you know that this is good, but you'll also see the problems with it too. I also recommend Austin Powers 2."
3,"It wasn't that groovy, baby!","Yes, it has it's moments like any film does. I just saw this for the first time waaay after all the hype had past. I guess I was expecting a non-stop laugh fest a-rama! There were only a couple funny farts I mean parts though! I enjoyed hearing ""I Touch Myself"" being played while the Fem-bots were being emploded, I can't think of anything else that stands out though. Maybe I need to see it again. Mike Myers was better in Wayne's World I'm afraid. Sorry all you Austiners out there!"
5,It was so funny I about peed my pants!,This is one of the funniest moovies I have seen! I watch it all the time when I want to laugh!
2,Do I just NOT get it??,"I like Mike Myers just as much as the next person, but I personally did not think this film to be all that funny. I was probably the last person to see it, after I heard it hyped by all my friends. Some of the lines and catch-phrases were very funny, but the movie went absolutely nowhere. Myers has done better work (ie: Wayne's World!)"
2,Terrible writing,"I thought that this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It ranks right down there with Natural Born Killers and From Dusk Till Dawn. The writing was terrible, Austin's teeth make me want to vomit and the 'hip' lingo pissed me off."
2,Lame camp humor,"If you don't really want a witty and insightful comedy -- then maybe you want the inverse, and ""Austin Powers"" is that! It's just lame, predictable, campy shtick. Both ""Wayne's World"" movies were better and that's not even saying much. Some of the gags in this film are just over-the-top and they are supposed to be, but it gets so old to the point of just annoying and entirely boring. Elizabeth Hurley is little more than a sex toy and proves that she can't act and she's not even funny. I liked Myers on Saturday Night Live, but this material leaves a lot fo be desired."
3,So-so comedy....,"The comedy doesn't deliver many laughs, and I just didn't care for the movie's general atmosphere...but it was okay. I thought Dr. Evil was hilarious, and Mike Meyers delivered an excellent performance....you kind of forget that one person is playing both Dr. Evil and Austin Powers...that's how good his acting is. Well, I'm looking forward to the sequel...."
4,Multi Region Owners should check out R2 disc,"5 star film, excellent presentation but owners of multiregion players should be aware that the US disk contains fewer scenes than the European, and exactly the same number of extras."
1,THE WORST MOVIE IN HISTORY,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The jokes are terrible and the humour is for 3 year olds. I've had more fun watching grass grow
3,Insulting DVD For America Release,"I really love this movie, one of the greatest satyres of the bond movies ever.But the dvd released for america was just insulting.No original Widescreen aspect ratio (the film has been cropped to 2:1 ratio instead of the 2:40 original).This is the Cut edition of the film, some scenes of the original theatrical release were cut (thankfully some managed to get to the deleted scenes section, but in fullscreen)The Video Quality is plain bad.This movies cries for a re-edition on dvd the way its meant to be. The Sequels had a better treatment.JPD"
1,If you've been drinking this MAY be funny,"I never got around to renting this movie until it was in the $1.99 area. Thank goodness. I was mad that I even spent THAT much on it. My husband (who usually likes stupid humor) fell asleep during this movie. I fast forwarded through many scenes trying to get to the funny parts that I found out didn't even really exist. The ONE SINGLE time I laughed (well, giggled) was the part where Austin Powers was trying to turn a golf cart thing around in a narrow hallway.This movie was a waste of time & money."
5,Austin powers,This movie was fun for the whole family.Mike myers did a smashing job of playing both Austin powers and doctor evil. The story was really imaginative. The best character had to bee Austin powers played by mike myers.The movie had lots of laughs and funny seenes. I would give this movie a 9 out of tne. All i can say is this movie was groovy baby.
1,Waste of time!,"I just saw this movie, and was pretty disapointed. It wasn't half as funny as I thought it would be. I only laughed a few times. I thought that Dr. Evil was pretty funny, though."
1,Cannot be worse,"Is this movie is supposed to be funny? ,... very boring , nothing else to say about it"
1,Find it hard believe people actually pay to view this movie,"This was a ridiculously horrid movie with no pupose. It was pointless, disgusting and not worth the least of my time.The only part I laughed at was Mr. Biggleswirth, and even then it was only a mere chuckle. Any one who is intellegent like I am would agree with me as I say ""grow up and get a life."""
1,THIS MOVIE IS HORSE SH*T,IT WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL. IF I COULD I WOULD RATE IT A -5 STAR! THIS MOVIE IS STUPID!
5,"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER, I LOVE IT, YEAH BABY YEAH",I've seen this movie at least fity times and it never gets old. I love this film!!!!
2,Ungroovy!!,"I consider this movie to be a waste of time and money. I expected this hyped up movie to be far better than it was. Lots of childish bathroom humour and dumb jokes. I hope there is never a sequel, but there are people out there who like this kind of slop!"
4,"VERY SHAGADELIC, BABY","I saw the second movie, last week and I loved it. So I decided to see the first one. I loved it from the very beginning. Mike Myers couldn't have played better. Dr. Evil was probably the funniest guy in the movie. Although it pulls sometimes, the acting covers the parts. I'd recommend it again, and again"
4,*These ... are pretty funny!!!*,"This movie was a riot, but the sequel, in my opinion was much more funny. These movies are supposed to be silly, if you're looking for a serious movie with lots of symbolism maybe you should buy Citizen Kane. (That one was good too!) :)"
4,"Packed DVD's are my bag, baby!","I am a big Austin Powers fan and the first one always has that special spring in it's step. This Platinum Series transfer is impresive: 2 alternate endings as well as other deleted scenes, director/star commentary, trailer, and other surprises. The only problem I had was the commentary being against a totally mute film. In films like Dogma when they're on DVD, the sound is somewhat audible and you hear important points the filmmakers discuss. Still, you gotta love this shagadellic DVD!"
5,Shagadelic,"This is a movie everyone has to see! If this humor doesn't make u laugh I don't know what will! The jokes are really superb, I still can't stop laughing and I saw the movie about 10times! I love this film and Elizabeth Hurley so for me this is one of the greatest movies ever!!!"
5,Great film -- and one of the scariest stunts I've ever seen!,"I just watched ""Safety Last"" for the first time and I have to say -- the building climbing sequence was one of the scariest movie scenes that I (admittedly an acrophobe) have ever seen -- it actually gave me vertigo! Harold Lloyd was such an amazing actor, he was charming, funny and one of the best silent film comedians -- and that building climbing scene just blows me away, I can't believe he did it (and with only one and a half hands, too -- he'd lost part of his right hand in an accident, and yet he could still do a stunt like this). The film is terrific, I really liked it, and wow -- that final scene, my head is still spinning!"
2,Poor condition... Great price,"Terrible condition. Far worse than the description allotted. However, it was a great price and arrived very quickly (even if the packaging was not suitable to protect the product)."
1,Unresponsive Seller,Two requests for shipping info weresent through the Amzon link. Neitherhave been given a reponse. Comon courtesyis missing with this supplier.
5,Thorogood live,"Rock out with this awesome live show, great quality, awesome set list, great performance and just an over all pleasure. Rock on Mr. Thorogood"
1,asparagus roots,"Arrived in a timely manner, but banded and put in a simple priority mailing box. Planted from the top of the box; the bundles were unlabeled. Then the last two bundles were labeled ""Purple Passion""! Did I get any Jersey Supreme? Time will tell, but I will be very disappointed if this patch I plan to keep for years is not the variety I paid for."
5,One Hell Of A CD,Welcome to the world of Ozzy This cd should be over rated due to its intense greatness Ozzy has come of with some of the greatest music and that's somethinf that I cannot ever get sick of listening to OZZY RULES!!!!
2,No no no no,Im not a fan of Ozzy at all. It was the ol' birthday present thing. All the songs suck except Crazy Train. And I only like the opening to it. Thumbsdown.
1,An Abomination,Others have already summed up the how the original bass and drums have been re-recorded because of a spat between the Osbournes and the original bass player and drummer. What the Osbournes have done to this classic cd and to Diary of a Madman is a tragedy. Try to find the original vinals or the 1995 reissues on CD. Don't waste your money on this abomination. Ozzy has ruined both his musical integrity and musical legacy with these phony re-issues.
5,You can never go wrong with vinyl version of an album.,"If you really want to hear crazy train the way Ozzy and Randy wanted it to sound, then get the vinyl version of this album. I hear that the new remastered vinyl version sounds better, but this one sounds great."
1,This brings down the grace of Ozzy Osbourne and Randy Rhoads,"Ozzy Osbourne and Randy Rhoads make a close call to perfection in the Blizzard of Ozz. At least thats how I felt when I heard the first track. But then, on Crazy Train and especially Goodbye To Romance and the rest I was peaved. The horrible sound of the new bass and especially flat drumming made me sure I was ripped off royaly. Its true the two front men made an excellent debut album but the fact remains there was still that annoying disappointment in the background. I first heard side 1 on the radio and was totally awed, thats why Im buying the 1995 remaster off this site, and you should too. 1995 remaster -- worth the effort to get. Avoid even tempting to get this 2002 version at all costs!"
5,Osbourne Unleashed!!,"Blizzard of Ozz is an album that would make Lawerence Welk a metal fan. The album is brilliant. Songs such as, I Don't Know and Crazy Train are hard rocking, yet also hold very thought provoking lyrics, and Ozzy sounds incredible throughout this album. Also check out Randy Rhoads guitar playing, and especially listen to Revelation, (Mother Earth), and you'll even hear elements of classical music. This is a must have for any headbanger, as evident by the fact that four or five songs from this album are still staples in Ozzy's live show nearly twenty years later."
1,Disgraceful,The remix w/ new drum and bass tracks is simply awful. Buy the 1995 remaster rather than this [flop]
2,"Shame on you, OZZY!",This spectacular greedy decision is something beyond description. Gone are Daisley and Kerslake phenomenal rhythm work. In come Trujillo and Brodin uninspired copy!!I hope the sales for this turkey be a total failure!
1,That (C-word!),"I just found out about this atrocity and am pretty freakin annoyed. In his haze of an existence, the wife took over Ozzy's career and does everything she can to disgrace his good name. Organizing a large group of fans to come to Ozzfest and pelt Iron Maiden with objects is just the latest that the miserable c-word has done. No wonder her kids are messed-up spoiled jerks who'll be dead via suicide or o.d. Ozzy will probably outlast those two pathetic reject clowns.I've been listening to the 2 Randy Rhoads albums since the 80's and they are 2 of my favorite records. Rhoads was the most dynamic guitarist ever in my opinion. But the drums and bass on both albums, espcecially ""Diary"" are just as important and the wife of Ozzy replaced them w/ half-assed musicians trying to mimic the originals.Please do not buy this album and support this abortion!! Find the originals which are far superior and don't give this c-word any more money!! Hopefully, she will die soon. Thanks."
1,Thanks for ruining a masterpiece Ozzy!,"I bought it and at first I really liked it. Then I bought an original and it blew this away. Ozzy and Sharon ruined two masterpieces. Just because you don't want to pay someone or because you don't like them doesn't mean you ruin masterpieces. While your at it, take Bill Ward and Geezer Butler off the first three Black Sabbath albums. This is like the first three Metallica albums without Cliff Burton and Lars Ulrich. This is like the first two Pantera albums without Vinnie Paul or Rex Brown. I have no respect for Ozzy anymore. Money got to his head. If he has any respect for his fans he will put out the originals again. How could you replace the original rhythm section with the loser from Faith No More and Robert Trujillo. Trujillo is good but it still isn't the same."
1,Beware!!! Don't buy this CD!!!,"This is NOT the original band or recording!I can't believe this. Remember when Ozzy was so cool? Why would anyone mess with the original music? Take one of the greatest rock albums of all time and 20 years later mess it up. Thanks alot. A friend of mine had an original copy, so I'm OK. I feel for the sorry folks who spent money on this horrible waste. This is an expensive coaster."
2,OVERRATED!,"I've been told this is the greatest hits of heavy metal.after listening to it several times,i can't understand why so many people love it.Led zepplin is the real heavy metal God ,not ozzy.there are no new things here.don't buy it if you are a diehard zepplin fan."
5,Excellent,"Blizzard of Ozz is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time. From I Don't Know to the last track, the band gives 100% There are no weak tracks, but my least favorite is No Bone Movies which is anti=porn, of which I'm a fan. everyone complains about the re-recorded drums and bass, but I could care less. The bass sounds awesome, wheras on most metal albums you can't hear it well. This cemented Ozzy has a solo artist after leaving Black Sabbath."
5,Ozzy's greatest CD,"This is Ozzy's greatest CD ever. I'm so sick of people giving this cd two, or even one star because the bass and drums where rerecoded. This cd has the unforgetable riffs of Crazy Train, , and I Don't Know. These riffs are done by the late, the great, Randy Rhoads (who is my favorite guitarist). It has the infamous tracks, Sucide Soultion, and Mr. Crowly. Even the less known tracks, Such as Steal Away (The Night) and the very much underated song, Revelation Mother Earth. The extra track You Looking at me, Looking at you, is a great track, and worth listing to. If you liked this CD I would also strongly recomend ""The Randy Rhoads Tribue"" album, which has all these tracks live, and a few from Diary of a Mad Man."
1,A slap in the face to fans nationwide.,"This is the worst thing Ive ever heard.Who does Ozzy think he is recording the bass and drum tracks?Thats really unfair.I have no respect for Ozzy and Sharon anymore because its plain to see they have no respect for me or any of the other people who want the real versions of these albums.Its a slap in the face to the original musicians who were really talented more talented than the hacks he had do the bass and drums on these versions,a slap in the face to fans everywhere and a slap in the face to the late great Randy Rhoads who I know would want the real versions of these albums featuring the musicians he worked with.I hate Ozzy Osbourne and Sharon with a passion.This is the most disrespectful awful thing in the world and I wish Ozzy wasnt so damn greedy.This just puts me in a bad mood.Do not buy this."
1,cannot believe they did this,"is anyone else shocked by the nerve of ozzy and sharon for recording over the bass and drums so the original guys wouldnt get any more money in royalties? that is so low its beyond words. this isnt 1984 (the book) you arent aloud to go back and erase history and pretend like something never happened. if randy rhoades was still alive, who knows, ozzy could have been on the outs with him too and had zakk wylde mess up all his guitar tracks too. dont buy this album! its a piece of crap and a slap in the face to the original musicians. seriously, why not re-record the guitars too so randy's family cant get any more money either? jesus. what a nightmare. i just keep losing more respect for ozzy. i just saw him live and he was playing to a backing track. i dont mean just singing- zakk wylde wasnt playing either. that is not a joke, they werent playing. ozzy is a joke now. listen to the original recording. screw this thing."
1,Randy would NOT have this!,"Ozzy's not the same middle-finger-to-the-establishment rock n roll rebel he was when I embraced him as a metal god.Man, this is so disappointing - first sleeping with the enemy, EmpTV and now this. Man.....I blame Sharon, Ozzy, George Lucas, and Sony for bunkin' this wicked once-superior album.Rhoads would pluck a vicious solo about this whole sorry affair if he were alive."
1,Ozzy re-recorded the bass and drums!,"I can't believe that Ozzy would destroy this masterpiece by re-recording Lee kerslake's drums and Bob Daisley's bass. To re-record any part of an album is just simply not done. How can you expect to be able to put new bass and drum tracks on a cd 23 years after its release, and have it fit the way the original tracks did. I'm sure that Robert Trujillo (bass) and Mike Bordin (drums) tried to use vintage equipment to come as close as possible to the original, but that's not the point, just get the 1995 re-master that has the shrunken picture of the cover art and says Ozzy in big letters on the side."
3,GO BANANAS INSTEAD,"I just bought new CD's from my two favorite artists. Ozzy and Deep Purple. Thank God I bought Deep Purple's latest CD Bananas it's great. Gillan is such a great singer. The songs are all good for a change. I yawned my way through this Oz disc (been there, done that). The new Purple is the best thing they've done in many years. God bless this band.Ozzy please stop embarrassing your fans.Rock on brothers and sisters."
1,Ownership of 'Blizzard' and 'Dairy' going to superior court.,"'Directors cut' and 'Special Edition' may be the new titles for the newly remastered 'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Dairy of a madman' if things really go bad in superior court. This could be another George Lucas remake of 'Star Wars',and that may not be good. The two albums that we have taken for granted for all these years may have come to an end,oh well,that's change."
1,It's a shame....,"It's a shame to rate this masterpiece one star, but it's the only posible option I've got open for me...Ozzy's managers not only re-recorded the album with Trujillo and Bordin replacing Daisley and Kerslake on bass and drums, respectively, but also ERASED Randy and Daisley (using computers) from the original photo that appeared on the back cover of the original version!!!Altough Trujillo and Bordin of course are master musicians and tried successfully to play like the original album, the original (which I own) sounds much more fresh than this re-recorded / remastered version. Onnly the volume level is superior in this new version. Unbeliavable!"
1,Eh?,"I just got this in the mail today, and I'm none too pleased with it. It's undoubtedly a classic album, but this whole re-recording business just blows. I swear the speed is off on a few tracks (Crazy Train seems slower on here than on the original). Avoid this like the plague, and hope you find a used original version on ebay or somewhere."
1,crap,"like others have said before me, the re-recordings of the bass & percussion ruin what the original brought to the table. i listened to this in disgust and immediatley got rid of it. i will now again be able to enjoy my original copy of this classic ozzy disc."
5,this is a classic album,"this album is a must own for anyone, the guitar work on all the songs are amazing, randy rhoads has to be the best metal guitarist ever, or just best guitarist ever. all the songs are amazing. ozzy's vocals go perfect with the instrument playing, this album is a must own, buy it now, i promise you it will not be a waste of your money"
2,OUTRAGE!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is unbelieveable, i can't believe that ozzy would do something as greedy and dishonorable as this. Screwing up classic metal albums just to save a few measly bucks, in my opinion, really says a lot about how ozzy feels about his first couple of studio albums. This is just........, look, i'll get to the point so you are not bored to death, don't buy this. Look for the 95' remaster."
1,Why?,"First of all, I do not have anything against Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin, but it still makes me angry that they would play a part in butchering a classic recording such as this one. No matter how well they would have played it still would have been sub par because it is not the original recording. Why do artists do this? No one liked it when Frank Zappa did this in the mid 80's, but at least the real versions were eventually rereleased. I mean as a huge Ozzy fan I can tolerate the reality show and even the Pepsi commercial, but this travesty really, even more so than the tv show and commercial, makes we wonder where Ozzy's true priorities are. It really makes me sad that a treasured album from my childhood is tainted by petty squabbles over royalties( which is apparently the reason Daisley's and Kerslakes tracks were replaced)and released in a clearly inferior form. Shame on Ozzy and all other involved in this project."
1,This is not the original! I have been ripped off!,"Boy, I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought this. I have always wanted to hear ""You Lookin' at Me Lookin' at You"", so I picked this up as soon as I saw it -- only to find that, without any notice on the outside of the package, Ozzy has replaced the original bass and drum tracks with re-recordings! What a gyp! Granted, the new drumming is probably better than the original (though I haven't listened to the whole new album) -- but the vibra-slap at the beginning of the new ""Crazy Train"" is weak! And, you shouldn't mess with history like this! It made me mad when Frank Zappa did it (on We're Only in It For the Money), and ZZ Top (on the Six-Pack), and Tangerine Dream (on the Tangents box set and other collections), but this makes me madder than any of those. You just don't mess with ""Crazy Train"" -- come on!"
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ""REMASTERED"" CD! BUYER BEWARE!!","Remastered nothing, its been almost completely remade and is musically inferior to the original version. Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake have been screwed out of royalties, and now they've been removed from the album altogether! Sharon Osbourne is one mean-spirited, greedy, over-materialistic person and the fact that Ozzy went along with it shows how little integrity he really has. I hate to say it, but I've simply lost respect for Ozzy Osbourne. I love his music and legacy, but there are certain things that are just inexcusably wrong, this CD is one of them."
3,almost but not quite,"This new version of ""Blizzard"" sounds like a carbon copy of the original. Lawsuits aside Bob and Lee were excellent in their roles and it's a shame they had to be recorded over. But the new sound is kind of refreshing, like hearing the record for the first time again. Randy's playing wasn't hurt at all in the mixing. The one new track you looking at me"" is classic Ozzy and Randy. I read one review where the reviewer said it didn't sound like Randy playing. That guy doesn't know his ""RR"" it is so obviously Randy that it feels like an original track. Well anyway I like the new sound."
4,Still rocks...,"I know it's not the ""original masterpiece"" but with the re-recording of the drums and bass, I still say this album rocks. Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin are 2 VERY talented musicians and they prove (not only being on tour with the Ozzman) it by playing this album perfectly. It'll be a collector's item if nothing else. But being a big of Robert, Mike and of course Ozzy I enjoyed this album, as much as the original. The re-recordings do not do the song any harm at all. Only pick it up if you're a true die hard fan or a collector."
3,Why????,I have compared the 2002 remastered versions with the orignals... the difference might be missed by some but... i assure you the 1995 remaster is better if you take the time to listen closely....the 1995 is better(this is because the 2002 is remixed and party remade)This is falsely labeled remaster it is a remake.Do yourself a favor and DONT buy the 2002 remade version. Plain and simple if u have ears and are payin attention it just dont sound as good. Besides i think any real fan would want the orignal versions no matter what.PS theres a new remaster of this out thats 2nd best with bonus tracks(due to some small defects and loudness of the mix) to the 95 remaster.
1,man...,"The original CD is classic, but they rerecorded the bass and drums, thus ruining the legacy by this legendary band, and worst of all, ruining the great guitar playing of the deceased Randy Rhoads. Thanks for screwing the fans over Ozzy...just give up already!"
1,... RETURN IT IF YOU BOUGHT IT!,"You're kidding right? I guess Oz and co. didn't have enough respect for this album to consider it a classic (as I always have)...This is the ultimate disrespect to the original band which included bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake. This is a frigin' rock band... not some bubble-gum band where the members are interchangable like Legos. The original tracks felt great. THE ONLY, ONLY, ONLY reason they were replaced is because some ""rocket scientist"" thought up, ""Well, if we're going to do a re-release with an extra track, wouldn't it be cool if we also replaced the bass and drums! Yeah! No one's done that before! It will be ground breaking!"" And this is the result. This is how the morons in the music biz think a lot of the time.Return it, and get your money back. I consider this false advertising because they never made mention of it. I want ""BLIZZARD OF OZ,"" not ""BLIZZARD OF OZ 'NEW & UN-IMPROVED""BEWARE: I THINK THEY DID THE SAME THING WITH DIARY OF A MADMAN."
1,Sure Glad I Read The Reviews,"Why would they re-edit this cd? Cut out the part's and add new player's? What was there to prove? Let's go ahead and cut out the Mona Lisa smile and add Madonna's smile,lol!Boycott this recording at all cost's, please.Bad enough that we all knew Ozzy didn't write the word's. But to spit in the face of those who we're responsible for the true power of a great rock n roll record??Enough said! For a guy who can't even articulate more then a couple significant words at a time. But everyone knows it's Sharon Osbournes carrer, really.Next thing you know Yoko Ono will be redoing The Beatles with new people, backing john,lmao!!In the long run Ozzy's (I mean, Sharon's)Show will show us what a fool he really is. Next thing you know, we'll all believe Anna Nicole Simpson, is really a sex symble.Ah but the magic of TV.But thank you for helping me to save a few buck's. Great music must be saved from it's self, sometimes."
1,THIS IS A TRAVESTY!!!!!!!,"OMG!!! ruined , ruined! why wld anyone do this to his own recording , its shd be on the front cover that this is rerecorded , not remastered , OZZY shd be ashamed"
5,Track Guide,"This has to be a classic album.Here are my track reviews.1. I Don't Know - brilliant song,one of my favourites...95%2. Crazy Train - classic song, ozzy at his best... 95%3. Goodbye To Romance - One of the softer ozzy songs, it still deserves...85%4. Dee - Rhandy Roads shows off his skills on this short but good track..80%5. Suicide Solution - one of the heavier tracks, and gets a blistering...95%6. Mr. Crowley - Also a heavy song, not as good as Suicide Solution,still it gets a good 80%7. No Bone Movies - blistering track, enough said...90%8. Revelation (Mother Earth) - Not a bad track, not in the same league as crazy train but still it gets...80%9. Steal Away (The Night) - A great track ,not heavy but its great in its own right...80%Overall,a great album that easily gets 90%+.Buy it and you wont be disapointed."
2,Irritating,"I could only listen to this CD halfway through before turning it off. Mostly the rhythm section is pretty much non existant, and the guitars and vocals are extremely tinny and bright, that I found it to be very irritating.Poorly remastered as far as I'm concerned.I love the original LP,and from the reviews,I thought this would sound great,but, I am totally disappointed!! Stick with the original!"
2,This Is A Dissapointment!!!!,When it comes down to this re-issue I was dissapointed how can they make a re-issue so bad maybe add more drums and bass that dont fit in. But if I was you I would buy the orginal and not waste your time or money on this on. This still is a classic album just the re-issue does not cut it. The extra tracks are the positive thing on this one if it was not for those this would get a one star. So dont buy this buy the orginal.
2,Shocked..!,"Well, I must confess I knew in advance, by reading im some rock magazines, that Daisley and Kerslake had been replaced. Anyway, I went for it, mainly due to the bonus track ""You Looking At Me Looking A YOu"" and also by te booklet with lyrics (my old CD versions of Blizzard and DIARY does not contain the lyrics).Then slowly, the absurd of it all sunk into me... THis is a classic gem, something to be respected. Anyway, I listened to it..What I did not expect was that the mix was so BAD. The re-recorded parts are plain for all to see, things just don't mix!So, what I did? I kept the new booklet, put the old into this new horrible reissue, and gave it to a friend of mine. That's it, I GAVE IT, I did not have the courage to sell it to him.THe worst thing is that, judging by his typical behaviour in that lousy program in MTV, even if someone tells Ozzy about the bad critics his attitude has produced, he probably will wave his hands and say: "" Well, fu..k them all! """
1,"What have you done, Ozzy?","I will repeat sentiments voiced many times already: LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE. This is a classic album, and the Osbournes have destroyed it with this version. The TV show and now this have officially lowered Ozzy's coolness factor to ZERO."
1,Randy must be rolling over in his grave,"As a kid, I listened to this album countless hours. I was a HUGE Rhoads fan, and I always dug Ozzy's voice. I was flat out disgusted when I heard this version of Crazy Train on the radio yesterday. These new guys didn't even bother to take the time to get the tone right, or try to mimic the original. Keep in mind, mimicing the original isn't always a good thing, especially when the new musicians are better, but these new guys suck. Why didn't that dishrag Ozzy didn't get Tommy Alridge or Rudy Sarzo to re-do the album? I'll tell you why, because those guys have CLASS and would have refused to it.Bah, I'm through with Ozzy, this is version of the album is LAME!!"
1,Original or 1995 Remastered,"Im sorry, but you can't recreate the magic of this album when you remove the original drum and bass tracks. Remember this was Ozzy's first solo effort. It was originally recorded and written with Ozzy, Randy, Lee and Bob in the studio together. Get the original album, the 1990 cd or the 1995 remastered cd."
1,AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!,"I'm sure you've heard it already. Get the 1995 blue version. On this one, the original bass and drum tracks have been erased and re-recorded with different people. It shocks me that a musician of his stature and fame could do something so utterly disgusting."
1,PATHETIC!!,I can't believe Ozzy would do such a thing as re-record the drums and bass. It is a total disrespect to Randy and anyone who supports this decision is not a true fan. I hope Ozzy has some sort of serious backlash from this decision. BOYCOTT OZZY. This is just something you do not do.
1,Garbage,"I bought this CD to replace the one I had since 1992 because it was all scratched up. I knew something wasn't right the moment I started listening to it. This ""remaster"" is horrible, the rythm section is sloppy, and bass is too loud. What a waste of money. Do not buy this CD."
2,stinks,"Ban this cd. Aside from the rotten, dull songs, it empowers dudes with mullets to commit savage acts of sodomy on each other. While that concept may sound funny, other side effects spill over into pop culture, warping the fragile balance of nature. Commonly, one will observe dudes working on their pickups on their front lawns, nascar stickers abounding! Ozzy's pathetic rantings are perfect for those who live in grandma's basement while collecting welfare. The same can be said for ANY ozzy cd, and all comparative 80's crap-metal. Cliche garbage."
1,Shame on Sharon/Poor Old Ozzy,"Yoko Ono multiplied by a thousand? Meet Sharon Osbourne. Was the TV show amusing? Sure, make Ozzy the Al Bundy of heavy metal music. What comes next? Removing drum and bass tracks so you don't have to pay the original musicians? A new low and a new lame. Sharon Osbourne pulling the plug on Iron Maiden during the Ozzfest, or staging hecklers? May Eddie sodomize Sharon in hell, where she'll assuredly be headed. She's turned Ozzy into a joke. Tell her to take all these ""reissues"" and stuff them. By the way, the Ultimate Sin album still exists, no matter how much you try to ignore it, Sharon. What, was Ozzy coked out and cheating on you then, so you want to bury that material, or is it simply you want to stiff a whole other set of musicians?"
1,I can't believe this has happened. Do not buy this cd!,"Butchering a classic album by rerecording it and marketing it as original recording remastered is just a horrible, crying shame. I think I feel sick. I used to love Ozzy... wtf!!!"
2,Negative side of OK,"Not that good and not too bad. Better than Diary of a Madman for sure. Bass is toned differently, as it can be heard from Crazy Train. It sounds as though someone is in constipation.Ozzy sounds better here than in the 1995 remasters though. Randy's playing blends in with the drums and bass on some songs, but it doesn't sound original. Buy it if you are a diehard."
1,Violation of the Sanctity of a Classic Album,"Like so many others, I was lured into buying this inferior new reissue. I bought Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman many years ago on cassette and had just recently decided to upgrade to CD. I was pleased to see that new reissues had just been released. I was unaware, however, that these reissues gave no indication that this was a gross injustice to the ORIGINAL albums. I popped the disc in upon purchasing it and something didn't sound right. It was then I realized, after looking through the liner notes that I was listening to [an imitation]. The mix is awful, the new bass and drums sound like puke, and most importantly they've insulted the memory of one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time, Randy Rhoads."
1,The Politics of Money,"A definitive statement from the 1980s music scene has been altered to the point of being a ""new"" and vastly inferior.Then embroiled in litigation over royalty payments that pitted bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake against Ozzy Osbourne, the 2002 reissue replaced the performances of the pair with bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin. The ""new"" album muddles the rhythm section to the point of making such incredible tracks like Crazy Train. Mr. Crowley and Goodbye to Romance sound like a medicre cover band at the corner bar on a slow Wednesday night.New fans may never hear the real music, since the original masters have been removed from the marketplace and replaced for all the wrong reasons. That an artist attempts to rewrite history is disturbing...that it cheapens what was a classic hard rock release is disgusting."
1,Find a different remaster,who re-records the rhythm section? this sounds so terrible i had been shying away for years from buying this version but this was all amazon had so i figured what the hell. and man im so sorry i wasted my money. the bass is too loud and out of tune and the drums sound so messy. the showcase of this album should have been randy not this sub par bassist. the album honestly just sounds like really bad cover after really bad cover.they changed ozzys vocals up and added in weird sound effects in places. and for those of you who are going to buy it for the bonus track... it's very forgettable trust me on this folks.find an actual remaster of the original
1,Ozzy the hypocrite,"Haven't even heard these 2 CD's, but after being a fan for more than 25 years, I am pissed off. It's all about money and screw the orignial musicians that contributed to the magic of these albums. You're a jerk Ozzy! You still rock like a mutha but damn! Don't you have enough money. Don't mess with something that's not broke and stop listening to the old ball and chain. Come back down to earth Ozzy."
1,THANK YOU GUYS....,"I had just bought the 2002 version. The cd was still wrapped as I came here to read customers' reviews on it. Thank you guys! As soon as I read them, I got back to the cd store and had it changed. Thank God I hadn't unwrapped it already! I'll be searching for the 1995 version. I'm sooo curious to hear this masterpiece but I'd rather have my hands cut off than to buy this version! I'll wait no matter how long it'll take...You're all right: we must not let Ozzy make money on this outrageous version. He himself must realise what he has done: I hope he will not sell 1 more copy of it!! May it serve him right....:-)"
1,Sharon's greedy business practices kills historic metal!!,This album has her fringerprints all over it. We know who calls the shots! The bass and drums were removed so that Daisley and Kerslake could be cheated out of royalites = more $ in the Osbourne's bank account! I also hear they're making 'Ozzy Osbourne: The Movie' Give it up! The original Blizzard was a masterpiece.
3,*Not* the album you grew up with,"As great as Ozzy's first album is, be aware that due to an ongoing lawsuit between Ozzy's original rhythm section Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley on one side, and Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne on the other, the bass and drum tracks on ""Blizzard of Ozz"" and ""Diary of a Madman"" have been re-recorded by Ozzy's current rhythm section. Caveat emptor."
1,randy rhoads fan,"OZZY,{or should i say sharon}HOW DARE YOU.randy is rolling in his grave.what a disgrace"
1,WARNING! THIS ALBUM SUCKS!,"God is this album overrated, i wish the ozz just stayed out of music when he left sabbath so crap like this wouldn't exist. i was shocked at all of the 5 star rated reviews for this awful album. i like heavy metal and all but this is just an embarresment to the gendre, if i here crazy train just one more time,JUST ONE MORE TIME!, i am gonna freak out, it's probably the most annoying song ever written. anyway, this album is proof of ozzy's lack of talent, he is nothing with out sabbath. if it wern't for iommi,butler and ward, this guy would be living in a dumpster in birmingham england eating yesterdays newspaper for lunch. i hate how he is so reveared by people for acting like a complete retard on and off stage."
1,Disgusted,"I'm so upset that this classic album has been monkeyed with,that I'm done with Ozzy. I really can't believe this happened,but lets face it, Ozzy's music has been lousy for decades now. I used to worship Ozzy,but hes a joke now. He has no integrity as an artist anymore, and Randy would be very angry."
1,History revisited at the expense of art,"Its an abomination to have replaced original musicians Lee Kerslake and Bob Dailey with members of Ozzy's current band. Why not rerecord Randy Rhodes guitar parts and use Ingwie Malmsteen to do the job? Or worse yet, lets get Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy's parts, hey it worked in Black Sabbath, Oz should be used to it by now. Either scenario would be as inappropriate as this Sharron Osbourne led hatchet job. To ruin an album because musicians actually wanted to get paid for their work is inexcusable. What should we expect though from the daughter of a gangster? The greed is just sickening. I will look for the '95 reissue to replace my worn out cassette copy instead of buying this travesty."
2,This album should be called Blizzard Revisited,This is not a remastered version of Blizzard of Ozz as one would think. The original drum and bass track have been RE-RECORDED by DIFFERENT MUSICIANS than those on the original.I was fooled when I bought this. Hoodwinked. Bamboozled.PLEASE don't make the same mistake!This album should be called Blizzard Revisited. You can't re-record significant parts of an album and call it remastered!!Not recommended!
1,"1 star for ""this"" not original","Here I am on a boring Saturday afternoon just poking around Amazon blindly & for the heck of it I put ""Ozzy"" in the search & find a low rating for what I believe to be the greatest album EVER made, bar none!! And thought...(insert vulgar language here) & thought I had to find out why & defend it by rating it 5 stars......until I saw why people were complaining.You simply DO NOT mess with a classic...period!!!! Glad I still own my original CD I bought in the early 90's which the rating scale does not go high enough to reflect my opinion!"
5,Randy Rhoads is God,"This is perhaps the finest guitar work ever done in an album of any style of music. Rhoads sparkles in gems like ""Mr. Crowley,"" which is still one of my favorite songs, and ""Revelation (Mother Earth)."" Teamed with Ozzy's surprisingly meaningful lyrics, this album is a must have. The critics may have been cold to this album because they have always shown strong prejudice to the entire heavy metal genre, but screw them. Rhoads' death was tragic. He was easily better than people like Van Halen or Malmsteen, who represented the heavy metal guitar gods and ""Blizzard of Oz"" and ""Diary of a Madman"" prove it. He brought a feeling to the music that emulates the perfect combination of neo-classicism and old-style blues. No one since played with more feeling than Randy."
5,Ozzy FreAkin..,"rocks the houSe.Randy Rhoads showcases his classical guitar.Lovely! I'm thinkin of Sarolta.I enjoy Ozzy and I'll be a woman.One who rivals Sharon Ozbourne..I'm Ozzy's! sarolta can save me from this, but Randy Rhoads it's sad to say has died at 23 years of age.Guitars so wild, ozzy:Kindest man ever met when he's sober according to Joe Lynn Turner RainboW's vocaliSt"
1,Ruined!,"I ordered this disc but cancelled my order after reading the other reviews here. A classic album has been ruined. If you can find it, get the original version."
1,$haron's Finest Hour...,"BEWARE:This is a ""remastered"" version of the original in which they (Ozzy and Sharon) have removed the work of bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake, whose playing was (and remains) so instrumental to the success of these records. This was done out of spite and is so sick as to be almost beyond belief. If these records ever meant anything to you - and if they still do - DO NOT BUY THESE REMASTERS!!!!!Look for the 1995 remasters (the little album cover with the quilt-like border). Bob and Lee helped bring out the best in Randy; this is how they are repaid. Unreal. You reap what you sow $haron. Shame on you."
5,Fantastic!,"Ozzy's first solo album, and his best. You only need 2 of his albums. This one and Diary of A Madman. After that, it goes downhill until No More Tears. Randy Rhoads's solos are amazing. It really is very sad how he died at a young age. And there's also the great drumming and basswork. It proves that they're not there to make the guitarist show off. Ozzy's singing is not as nasal as other albums, but it is Ozzy, alright. Some classic riffing here. ""Crazy Train"" and ""Revelation"" are the best tracks on this album. ENJOY!"
2,If that is the case:,"Then wouldn't Rudy Sarzo also have something to say about the re-recordings or was he just a touring session bassist on the Diary of A Madman tour when he was with Brad Gillis at the ""Speak of the Devil"" Tours or were those completely different concerts. This is why I only gave it 2 stars because of the comments above on the page."
5,R.I.P. Randy,This recording introduced most of the world to the fantastic guitar playing of Randy Rhoads. He was great on this and Diary of a Madman. He passed way before his time and he is missed.
4,"Not the original, but still great nontheless","The reviewer below me is a dick. Did he read the review below his? THEY WANTED THEIR PARTS REMOVED FROM THE ALBUM. Holy Crap. The guy spelt Rhoads incorrectly too. Sorry, it makes me mad when people cannot spell his name right, i mean... holy crap, SPELL IT RIGHT. Yes the original recording is better, but that does not change the fact that this release is good too. It is much easier to obtain than the originals and is just overall more practical. If you have the original then there is no reason to buy the release unless you really want the 1 bonus track. This album is certainly not bad, just a dissapointment to fans of the original recording. Randy and Ozzy are still here, and they are the main people that I care about anyway."
5,One of Mr. Osbourne's greatest,"I personally don't know why some of these people rated it 2,3, or 4 star cd. I tell you it's a 5 star cd. This cd was the first solo album of ozzy, and it featured the amazing guitarist Randy Rhodes, who played in a band you may have heard of, ""Quiet riot"". \m/. Anyways this cd features songs that he still does on his tours. I went to Ozzfest 02, and he played songs off this cd such as; I don't know, Crazy Train, Mr. Crowley, Suicide Solution, and goodbye to romance. And all these songs are top notch. So if you want to get the best Ozzy album, this is the one."
3,Cool remix! Sounds better than the original,"I was very curious when I heard that the bass and drum tracks were re-recorded. Upon hearing the improved version of this album, I am very happy that Ozzy and Sharon decided to remix and remaster this album. The album has more punch and clarity than the original, and Randy Rhoads tone is more clear than before. It was great to hear the bonus track ""You Looking At Me, Looking At You"". For too many years, we've had to endure bootleg versions of this song. Finally, we can hear the song as it was meant to be heard. Way to go Ozzy and Sharon! Randy Rhoads RIP."
1,A Travesty!!!,"I won't go in to detail here but as many others have already pointed out the replacement of Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake on this album as well as on ""Diary"" is inexcusable. While we're at it let's take Geezer Butler and Bill Ward off the first two Sabbath albums! Something tells me Sharon O is behind this. I am absolutely appalled! I can hardly believe it! An outrage!!"
1,"A tragedy, a travesty, and a damn shame.","Ozzy's legacy died the first time that 'The Osbournes' aired, however, his early music lost none of the magic it contained. The music is dead now, too.I can forgive Ozzy for his skinflint wife's actions directed at one of the greatest metal bands in history, Iron Maiden. (And Sharon, if you honestly think Ozzy can hold a candle to Maiden...you really are a 'Yoko') But this... this is simply unforgivable.And the worst part is...I used to cherish these albums. They were something special. Now...now all I get is a distinct feeling of disgust in my gut whenever I hear any of these tracks.Truly and unabashedly unforgivable. I never thought I would see the day..."
1,Rob,"I bought this CD without realizing that it been so drastically changed and that the bass and drums were actually new recordings by other people. But when I played the CD I thought ""I don't remember the song sounding like this"", so I checked the CD to only discover the truth. The rest of the reviews here can go into detail, read them if you will, But I can tell you one thing: This remaster sucks!I don't know the politics behind this travesty, nor do I care, but I will never listen to this one again, and I am going to purchase the older remastered version that still has all of the original music on it.Don't buy this CD, you will be sorry."
1,The drums and bass sound like garbage,Why it gods name did Ozzy do this remaster and redo of the bass and drums....the drums are horrible. This redo sounds like rejected demo's and take the power away from these songs.
1,"err, what the....","When it comes to re-issues of classic albums remixing is something very tricky and needs to be done extremely carefully. It's done occasionally, like a number of John Lennon albums which were originally horribly produced and muddy sounding (for example Imagine) - perhaps they needed it. This Blizzard (and Diary) reissue goes even beyond remixing to re-recording main instrument tracks. Who in their right mind thought that was acceptable to do to a perfectly fine master? Why would the record company even allow this to begin with - replace a masterpiece recording with a at least partly re-recorded album? I mean albums are historic material in themselves, to mess with them is just not right. They need to come to their senses and pull this crap off the shelves and release the proper remaster. I still have the 1995 release so I'm doing good, but this is really a shame. To even entertain the idea of re-recording those bass and drum tracks was retarded."
1,FIND AN OLDER ORIGINAL VERSION - don't buy this desecration.,"The Ozzy camp has removed the original bass player and drummer from this classic album and re-recorded the parts with bogus replacements. The end result...garbage.When compared to the orignal, this new version is unlistenable. The new rhythm section performances are sloppy at times, and generally thin sounding. The mix is way over-compressed, and the ""grab you by the balls"" magic this recording once possessed is long gone.To attempt to understand why this was done, one has to know both sides of this story. There is plenty of information on the web, so I won't go into all the details here. A good place to start would be bobdaisley.com/interviewsHopefully, this rotten situation will be resolved, and Blizzard & Diary will be released as they were originally intended. Until then, find a used copy of the 1995 remastered version and if you have a pen handy, on the credits page, write ""lyrics by Bob Daisley""."
4,"Pricey, but pretty good","These panties fit nicely and are more flattering than I thought. They aren't completely invisible--they tend to bunch a bit. But, they're my first choice for clingy dresses and white slacks. They are a bit pricey, so I'm not sure I'll buy a second pair until these wear out."
4,Kitschy Fun,"I heard a few of the tracks on Howard Stern's morning show and figured this was up my alley--and I was right.If you have a sense of humor about the music you listen to, this is definitely worth your time (The ""All in the Family"" entry is particularly hilarious). Only a few stinkers of note: Carmen Sandiego, Charles in Charge (who remembers the theme to THAT anyway), and some others I didn't recognize are few and far between. And, the ""Different Strokes"" theme is sung by Todd Bridges (which is mercifully brief--Keep your day job, Todd).Keep in mind there are a few songs where the words are changed a bit (Friends, Gilligan's Island and The Monkeys all have the ""F"" word in them)....and there are two commercial themes thrown in for good measure (""I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke"" is a standout and ""Slinky"" isn't bad either)."
2,"Be careful, these are not the original recordings or artists","Actually, it's not as bad as it could be, except that once I figured out I had made the mistake of not realizing these were not the original theme songs I gave it another listen and was disappointed that the language was so foul. You just need to know what you're getting into before you buy this one."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this CD as I thought I was purchasing an ""original"" TV Theme song CD. Pay close attention when purchasing from Amazon.com. This CD is more a heavy metal type music with foul language which is something I would not have purchased. Once I opened and played it (and the return policy is null and void) and realized the error. Oh well, something else to gather dust in my desk drawer."
4,Want your long nails back?,"I've used Biotin 3 years now, and my nails today are the best they've been in 20 years. It takes a while to see great improvement, but if you're patient, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
2,"Worked on my hair, but not my nails...","Because of low cal diet, my hair was falling out in clumps every day -- lots of clumps. It was thinning quite a bit. My dermatologist gave me this supplement, which sells for 3 times the Amazon price in her office. I just finished 3 months. My nails are chipping and flaking more now than they were before. I don't have long beautiful nails after three months of biotin. In fact, every time they grew a bit, they would break right there where they attach to the skin. My hair on the other hand looks good, and I have stopped shedding so much hair. I probably won't take biotin any more unless I return to my diet and start losing a lot of hair again. I don't think it did anything for my nails."
4,Seems to work well,"This product seems to work well for increasing fingernail strength. I have been using this product for about six months, and I recommend it."
3,Appearex,"Although Appearex has not made them the long, hard, lovely nails I've always dreamed of, they are much more stable, less likely to peel and the horizontal ridges have all but disappeared. BTW, my hair is also better."
5,Appearex Biotin The Best,Great Product. My nails are getting harder everyday and my hair is growing stronger as well. I cannot wait to see what happens in 3 months.
5,Great Product,"Appearex Biotin has restored my fingernails back to normal. My nails were peeling or layering, splitting and cracking. I had to keep cutting them until I had no more nails to cut off and they were still peeling or separating in layers. My dermatologist suggested this product and told me it may take up to 3 months to see results. I saw results in about 2 1/2 months and it just keeps getting better. The same dosage in other brands is a huge horse pill. Appearex Biotin is a tiny little pill that I can swallow much better. I now have long beautiful fingernails again."
5,Appearex Bioitin Tablets,Great product. Fast and free shipping. Excellent price. Love the automatic quarterly shipment option.
4,Makes a difference,Was a little hesitant at first mainly because of the cost. Decided to purchase and at first thought I saw no immediate change (hair or nails). After three months of consistency my nails did grow beautifully and become somewhat stronger (with less ridges). As for my hair it seemed to grow faster and fuller.An excellent product if taken on a regular basis seeing change in about 3-4 months of use. NOTE: Must be taken regularly. Once you stop nails/hair return to prior state/condition.
5,Works well for me,"I was having a problem with my fingernails splitting and breaking. I started taking Appearex a few years ago, and it has really worked for me. Now my fingernails don't break or split anymore. Amazon price is very good for 84 count pack also."
2,update - I switched to Nature Made Biotin Liquid Softgels,*Update*I switched to Nature Made Biotin Liquid Softgels. They work much better and better price when you catch them on sale.*Original Review*Yeah so I have been taking this for a month now I dont see a difference yet but I'll keep taking it to see if anything improves. I will definitely come back and update this if all of a sudden girls tell me oh my god you have such nice nails and hair or whatever. If I dont update this that means I gave up on it.
3,appearex,it's too early to rate this product. it takes 3 to 6 months to see results. it did ship in a timely fashtion however.
1,Too soon to know if this med will work for me,My doctor recommended 1 per day to help with my cracking nails. But he cautioned that it probably would take 7 or 8 weeks before I would see an improvement. It's only 4 weeks and I have not noticed improved nails.
5,My tush hurts!!,"I have done this workout many, many times and I am still sore every single time I do it. As a more advanced exerciser I enjoy the harder exercise options. This is a fantastic video that I highly recommend! I even sent one to my mother!"
4,Great tool for the money,I bought this to do a little home improvement if you know what I mean.My girlfriend thought I was nuts but in the end she enjoyed the powerful 3/4 horsepower motor and flexible shaft.
5,"Not very impressive looking, BUT","While my wife had a nice vibrator, this is not a toy!!! A serious concrete vibrator that did an excellent job on my 65 foot block wall, by 7' high. I also used it on my 16X24 slab that was completely void free. I highly recommend this product."
1,Junk,Product lasted me about two concrete countertops before the trigger button stuck. Then every time I used it you would have to tap it on the ground to get it to work and then it felt like it was on a very high rpm rate that sent all of my cement material flying across the room out of the mold. Bottom line this product is built more poorly then even a harbor freight item.
4,"Excellent. But the real mystery is, why isn't this film better known?","This was a gorgeous, well-acted, well-crafted WWII thriller with a unique and rarely-addressed theme: the active role of the appeasement underground. From what I have seen here, some in this group (whole aristocratic families, in fact) were evil to the point of murdering those who disagreed with them. Why was this film not seen widely, and why are there are (at least on the jacket) no reviews whatsoever? Perhaps it is a shameful chapter in British history - ""dirty laundry"" some want buried? I find it peculiar in light of the fact that the cast is magnificent, the photography gorgeous and the plot line totally absorbing. Something's rotten in Denmark."
2,"This is a horror movie, not a mystery","I expected this to be a historical movie about the British movement to appease Germany just before World War 2, with a murder mystery thrown in. However, its purpose is to be a horror movie--which is why the plot doesn't make sense. Viewers are forced to continually watch a sensitive, beautiful, likeable young woman increasingly betrayed by almost everyone she loves, plus people she barely knows. She's lied to, humiliated, imprisoned, starved, terrorized, and is forced to watch her friends brutally murdered or discover their corpses. If you empathize with her, and it's hard not to, it feels like being psychologically tortured yourself. Why put yourself through this experience? The only things this movie has in its favor are beautiful settings and costumes, and you can see those in plenty of other movies and TV series."
1,Pointless Movie with a Ridiculous Plot,The movie has beautiful scenery and some fine actors. What it is missing is a coherent plot. The director would have us believe that a young English actress stumbles onto a conspiracy so vast wherein elements of the British Secret Service are so intent on avoiding another world war that they are assassinating anyone who opposes appeasement including members of parliament. Her family - who are all part of the conspiracy - try to teach her a lesson by kidnapping her nephew while she is supposed to be baby sitting and instead falls asleep. If this makes no sense to you whatsoever then you can tell where the rest of the story is going. Nancy Drew stories are better written than this script.
4,Interesting movie,Good period piece. I was surprised that so much effort was put into making a thriller period piece. The costumes were accurate and the scenery was wonderful. Acting was ok and script was decent.
1,Waste of an evening,"My husband and I expected an amazing film-it has an incredible cast and it was listed on someone's Amazon list along with other greats like ""Downton Abbey,"" Cranford,"" and ""Bleak House."" It turned out to be, I think, my least favorite film that I've ever watched-partially because the expectations were initially so high, partly because it leaves one feeling so ""blegh."" Not in a thoughtful, sorrowful way captured by, say, many Russian novelists, but just deep disappointment at the films mediocrity. Please don't waste your time with this one-I wish that we hadn't wasted money and time on this."
2,Could have been much better,"Glorious 39 starts out with a very interesting 'murder mystery.' The film, with an excellent cast of British actors (including one of the stars of the excellent TV series Downton Abbey) is about a partly true conspiracy to keep Britain out of WW2. People who know about the conspiracy are turning up dead, and only a young British actress seems to have any insight into the events. The problem for me, and I imagine for many viewers, is the murder mystery aspect of the film gives way about half into the film to a psychological / horror-type film. Not quite horror (and quite watchable), but for anyone wanting to know more about the conspiracy, the work of behind-the-scenes British fascists like Oswald Mosley, or just hoping for an old-style murder mystery will be very disappointed. This film could have been much better; the writers just seemed to run out of dialog and ideas. Too bad - I hope some good filmmaker will do much more with this rich topic."
1,STUPID,"What a waste of good actors, great scenery and sets!! The story starts out well and then steps quickly through the portal of crap with a ridiculous plot turn. I'd tell you what it is but my fingers will not type such dreck. Avoid at all costs."
1,A waste of 2 hours of my life!,"I saw a trailer and thought this looked to be quite an intersting theme for a film; the time before the war and the appeasement of Hitler.I was wrong. It is a truly awful film with absolutely nothing to recommend it. The script is wooden and lifeless, the acting as poor as you might expect from such a poor script and the direction so clumsy that any sense of tension that might be built up is very quickly lost.You look at the cast and think that this should be a good film......and it really isn't. Watch something else instead!"
2,Not exactly what I expected.,"Originally I heard Lisa Dabello as a guest vocalist on Alex Leifson's ""Victor"" album. She was impressive in the guest role and decided to try one of her solo albums, hoping I'd hear this fiery voice in her own particular musical environment. Nope, it just isn't the same. Let's put it this way: If you want someone to rock your socks off, this album isn't going to do it. If you have trouble sleeping some night and the usual remedies don't work, try this album.One redeeming quality is the appearance of David Gilmour (lead guitar, Pink Floyd) as guest guitarist. Perhaps he lost a bet or drew the short straw."
5,Fantastic,"Just fantastic. I have nothing to add. My personal favourites are ""Tango"", ""Talk to me"" and ""Immaculate eyes"""
2,Inexpensive but cheap.,"While around $5 for a tape measure seems like a good deal, this product is cheaply made. I purchased this one to replace another whose tape came completely detached. There is no way to open the product to re-attach the tape, so purchasing another one was the only option. Hopefully the new one does not come apart like the other. Inexpensive but cheaply made."
3,No metric measurements,"It's bad enough how slow the U.S. has been to fully adopt the metric system, but for a tape measure to not even have centimeter/millimeter markings at all? It's an okay tape measure otherwise, but I feel guilty for giving my money to a company that's this uncommitted to metrication, and recommend others to look elsewhere."
4,old good time,"One of my favorite album as a teenager. Great voice, great soud... I still like it. I love you Juliana... Roger"
5,A CD that shines all the way through,"Juliana's most outstanding achievement to date, Only Everything is perhaps Alternative rock's answer to what music should be. Sometimes haunting, often playful, with outstanding guitar and beautiful melodies throughout. A combination of innocence and hard-edge that no other artist could beat. I feel this CD out does her earlier band, ""Blake Babies"", and even her more recent ""Do Not Disturb"" album, which had a sound far different from any earlier work. Fleur De lys, written in French, is one of my favorite songs. If a CD can be worn out from overplay, this is the one you may never get tired of. If you enjoy this album, you may also like the band Veruca Salt, who have said they enjoy Juliana Hatfield."
4,"It's better than ""OK OK"".","""Only Everything"" might possibly be the best, and most well-rounded ""Juliana Hatfield"" album. Overall it's very solid, and has a good mix of rockers and softies. The hit here was ""Universal Heartbeat"", and along with the surrounding tracks starts the album off with a bang. ""Fleur De Lys"" is at least partially sung in french, and has a good grungy feel to it. Other sweet songs are ""Dying Proof"", ""Bottles And Flowers"", and ""Simplicity Is Beautiful"", though I really like them all. I'd call this a must for fans, and a great starting place for newcomers. Her 1992-2002 collection is excellent as well."
2,walking on sunshine... sorta,"OK, I've listened to this CD and was disappointed because... these aren't the original versions of the songs. See kids, Katrina and the Waves came out with two albums in Canada on the Attic label: Walking on Sunshine and the imaginatively titled Katrina and the Waves 2. Brilliant, brilliant stuff; each album has 10 songs and they're banged out in about 1/2 an hour on each record (yep, they're not available on CD). As for this CD, half the songs are from their first Attic record and the other half are from the 2nd, and they've all been re-recorded. Unfortunately, something definitley got lost in transition... except for ""Walking on Sunshine""; I'll always go with the horns version on this CD, 'cause it was the one I first heard. Fans, do yourself a favor, hunt down their first 2 Attic albums. They are worth it. And, oh, if anyone from Attic is reading this (does the label still exist?), put those records out on one disc!!! My record copies are wearing out!!!!!!"
2,Not born to sing atleast,"Will Smith is back and it's the same boring factory music as always. In each movie he makes it seems he just has to make the soundtrack. Men in black 2 was ok, but the ""Black Suits Comin"" is just as annoying as always, And now finally when we got rid it he releases ""1000 kisses"" which is cover/sample of Luther Vandross 80's hit ""Never too much"", am i surprised? Will Smith is stealing another 80's song for his rap? Come on get real. He's a wonderful comedian and a good actor, why can't he just stick to that. The music is just pointless and commercial and anyone can make a hit when they steal old skool stuff. No im defenitely not feeling this."
1,Tha Godd Of Rapp Returnz!!!!!,"Itz been so long since we have heard an album from the amazin' Will Smith.But finally,da wait iz ova!!Born To reign winz my pick 4 album of da year.""Nod Ya Head"" should have itz name changed to ""Clap Ya Handz""(Becuz dats what I waz doin while listenin to dat brilliant and complex song)"".""Willow Iz A Playa"" will have your car stereo bumpin',""Momma Knowz"" will have you lovin yo momma even more,and ""How Da Beat Goez"" will have you stompin yo feet.I would have given this record more starz,but the only problem iz there iz a bunch of bad language.There's more cuzzing on here than Eminem's ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" and Limp Bizkit's(GREATEST BAND IN DA WORLD)""Chocolate Starfish And da Hot Dog Flavored Wata"" put togetha,and dats not good for kidz.They really need to put a parental advisory sticka on this cd.Peace"
1,BORN TO DO WHAT,"YEAH- but the last time I checked the best rappers list will smith was not on there. Will smith is soo weak and why does he put jada on his c.d.,as if she didn't make a power move anyway by marrying him. There is one question that bothers me--WHY DID JADA KEEP HER LAST NAME-did she think that she was a star or actor or whatever. Who is tra-knox. I hope that he isn't thinking that he is going to put a rapper on the map by included them in his pukey c.d. I think that Will Smith and Shaq should battle. Although willy didn't make into my wack list,he was close."
4,Will's worst album still a solid effort,"This might be considered Will's worst album to a lot of people but there's still standout tracks like ""How Da Beat Goes"", ""Give Me Tonite"", and ""Block Party"" which were steps ahead of most hip-hop tracks I heard in the year of 2002, still worth the purchase, and if you enjoy this one, you'll definately enjoy the other JJFP/Big Will albums as well, especially the classic albums ""He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper"", ""Code Red"", ""Willenium"" and the recent ""Lost and Found"", he's definately ""Born To Reign"" as hip-hop royalty"
3,"One half good, one half mediocre","This is not one of Will Smith's best albums, solo or with Jazzy Jeff. While I like Black Suits Comin, 1000 Kisses and How Da Beat Goes (which samples Newcleus' Jam On It from 1984), the rest of the album and its beats sounds so uneven, mediocre, or disjointed. Several songs don't have the punch or addictiveness of the Big Willie Style or Willennium albums. Somehow, I think that this album was lost in the shuffle against heavy competition from the Nelly and Eminem albums in 2002. And not well promoted either. I noticed it got a lot of mixed reviews on major magazines. Somehow, I blame it more on the music and material given to Will, not him."
1,Born to Be Boring!!,Will Smith back in the day was a Decent Rapper when He along with Jazzy Jeff had some cool Moments but all Will does is a Puffy or P-Diddy Lite take.His whole vibe on Rapping&the Vocals are just so safe&basic.Jada isn't that Bad.but Will has gotten more than he should out of a Solo Career.the Soul Lite Karoke is long played out.
3,Not the WIll Smith I expected to hear....,"I have adored Will Smith forever. I have laughed at him on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, made it a point to see all his big box office movies, and still crank ""summer time"" up on my stereo. If you are looking for the likenesses of Willenium and Big Willie Style, this is NOT it. Most of the songs on this album dissappointed me. I was looking for the same old Will, thats what I prefer. If you like change and you are a Smith fan, get this CD. The songs have almost a 70's ring to it, and there is even one with a caribbean reggae style. Id rather keep it ""old school"" as he would say."
3,Not His Best But Okay,"I am a Will Smith fan so I expected a lot from this album. I was a bit disappointed when I first heard it but after a while some tracks started to grow on me. He's flow is a bit slow on this particular album but the lyrics are just okay. My favorite track on the album is the Nod Ya Head remix. The original is wack! Other favorite songs are ""Block Party"",""How Da Beat Goes On"" and ""1000 Kisses"". Tra-Knox on every song is a bit annoying but they can sing."
5,This CD is EXCELLENT.,"I was thrilled with this CD! This is truly Will Smith at his best. Every song is original, yet more, ""Big Willie Style,"" than ""Willennium."" Fans and other listeners alike will adore this album from hip-hop's hottest. My favorite song was probably, ""Give Me Tonight,"" which was laced with Latin-pop, but featured Smith's smooth voice and hot rhymes. This album is a must-have."
5,BEST ALBUM OUT NOW!,"Will Smith has done it again! He has created a great album with the headliner BLACK SUITS COMIN! He is still a family oriented with Willow is a Player, Momma Knows and many more! The album is great for anyone, not just Will fans or MIB fans, anyone!"
2,Try Again,I am a huge fan of Will Smith going back to the Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince days. I am truly disappointed in this album. It doesn't have the sound that has made Will so good in my books
2,Borderline.,"The proliferation of so-called gangsta rappers is as welcome as a zit on a 15-year-old, but does that mean we must tolerate the inoffensive, G-rated hip hop of Will Smith? All praise to Smith as a talented actor (an Oscar-nominated one, at that), but his rapping is cheesy even by preteen standards. Granted, he had a couple of singles that are wickedly catchy as they are guilty pleasures (""Gettin' Jiggy With It"" and ""Miami""), but on his latest album, we find Smith struggling to stay relevant in a climate that favors the flashiness of P. Diddy, the thuggishness of DMX, and the unchecked vulgarity of Eminem. ""Born to Reign"" has tracks that suffer from tired samples, dated production, and Smith's goofy delivery. With a bankable movie career, a strikingly pretty wife, and good reviews for his acting, Smith does have plenty going for him. But he needs to stay away from the studio. ""Born to Reign"" isn't a compete fiasco, but it comes dangerously close."
5,Good Energy and fun,"I love the Hip Hop Body Shop Series. The dancers have great energy and the moves are not too difficult to master. This is the second tape I have tried and it's fun each time I pop in the tape. I just wish it was on DVD. The twister abs really work if you do it everyday for like 15 minutes. YOu will see results! Even though I consider myself coordinated I still have a hard time mastering the routines but that's why it's a tape. Just rewind it, Duh!!"
2,Not the color I Imagined,"The shipping was quick. The color was listed as khaki, not so. It was very very light, almost a cream color. Disappointed."
5,A MUST HAVE for the beginning or advanced collector,"This is an excellent reference for anyone interested in Japanese swords. The authors have made not only a great handbook, but also one that is easily readable. It is an excellent buying guide in terms of identification, authentication, and evaluation. It also provides great information on sword knots, sword belts, and hangers as well as collecting tips and period photos. Don't go to a show without it! It gives you a knowledge advantage over 90% of the folks selling Japanese military swords. Easily pays for itself with your first treasure find."
3,"Content is okay, but watch out for errors!","The general content of the book is good for a general review, but make sure you watch for errors in the practice tests. Many of the answers listed in the answer keys are incorrect. Double check with another source or your history teacher if you aren't sure about a particular question; if you think you're correct and the book says otherwise, you're probably the one that's correct!"
3,This is Good ONLY for a supplementary review,"I just finished taking the AP US History test today and, after using the Princeton review book to study with, I felt that it did a good job in reviewing the material, but the information about the test was not always correct. For instance, the book states that the questions go in sets that are in chronological order, but in fact this was not true for the test. The AP test makers are aware of these types of review books and are making it different from what is in much of the review books. Another problem that I cam across with was that in the practice test, there was an error in one of the answers e.g. the correct answer was one letter but the explanation gave a different answer. Overall I would recommend this book with the warning that you should take the advice about the actual test with a grain of salt."
4,"Eh, it was alright","Because I'm from the West Coast, and West Coast schools start about a month after East Coast schools, my teacher stopped lecturing right around Eisenhower. So I bought this book to teach me the main points from Eisenhower to now and it did not work. It was way too general to do much teaching. However, after reading the summeries from earlier decades, it helped trigger knowledge that I probably would have no remember on my own. And reading those chapter summeries probably gained me 10 Questions on the multiple choice.The practice test was not very good, however. The question was basically rewritten from the summeries with the same wording, so I didn't have to do a lot of thinking. Didn't help too much on the essay questions.I would only buy this book again to have that remembering expierience, but not for the learning and practice test."
5,"Excellent monitor, weak speakers","This is a great LCD screen, with beautiful picture and very good response time which makes it suitable for games too. Produces sharp images, good contrast and nice colors. Didn't experience any dead pixels so far.The only reason I'd like to rate it 4 1/2 stars (if that was possible) is that the included speakers are marginal at best. I know almost none of the integrated speakers are good in LCD monitors - but this one is suitable only for simple Windows beeps and default sounds, nothing more.So get it for the screen, but make sure you have some good speakers if you require decent sound."
4,A definite best buy...,"I have had this monitor for about a month and absolutely love it! I use it exclusively as a television (digital cable, progressive scan DVD and Xbox) and it performs wonderfully in all situations. One thing to keep in mind is that there is only so much a television can do with a sub-par signal; if your cable signal is poor, the picture will be poor...that said, the digital channels I receive look pristine to the point of almost appearing 3 dimensional. DVD's look amazing, especially in 16:9 widescreen mode. It is highly adjustable and an excellent space saver. Compare it to smaller 15"" LCDs by some of the BIGS and you will notice that they are all in the $700-$1200 range. The Sceptre produces a picture that is just as bright, vibrant and crisp (in my opinion) as these pricier brands. Sound could be better and it could use a few more inputs, hence the 4 star rating. Wired magazine recently rated it a best buy - it truly is."
2,What service? Don't try to wall mount unless...,Cabinet is cheap looking and the box information is misleading. The base is not intended to come off (it leaves an unsightly hole if you do) and multiple calls and emails to customer support got zero response concerning this issue. I wanted to wall mount the monitor close to the wall. Can't do with this model so I took it back. Would hate to think what happens if you have serious support issues.
3,"Hard-of-hearing buyers, take note...","The picture quality on this monitor was quite satisfactory, and the 16:9 screen is great for watching DVDs and letterboxed movies, but despite all of this, there's one major gripe I have with this TV/monitor. The specifications listed on Sceptre's website and on several other sites claim that the X7SV has closed captioning functionality, but having actually looked at one of these monitors and returned it, I can say for a fact that it doesn't."
1,"Wait till you get it, you'll know why there is no image.....","This is the uglyest monitor I have ever owned, the colors are horrible, and the product is very Plastic looking the finish of the case is very rough, and un-finished also."
3,Good first step if you're considering owning a plane.,"This book helps narrow down the field as you consider buying or owning an airplane. Gives details about cost and offers real world examples of operating expenses (aircraft specification tables were particulary helpful). Covers what to look for, pre-purchase inspections, and paperwork needed to buy and register aircraft. Well worth the money if you're considering buying your first airplane."
4,Good read. Informative,Very useful if you are considering buying your first airplane. Found it to be informative and a good basic guide.
5,Perfect gift!,I bought this for my fiance's father who is interested in becoming a small plane owner and really enjoyed it.
3,Focused on doing it 'on the cheap',"This book assumes that the buyer is most concerned about the cost of ownership and how to do it 'on the cheap'. If this is not your situation, then this book may not be that useful to you. The case studies where interesting."
1,Sigh.,"Talk about cherry picking in a bad growing season. One huge problem is the runup is the propaganda used by the US against its own people. Had Pender looked the the role played by the Cheney branch of government, it would have been far more realistic and honest."
3,Yes,I am a huge Alice Cooper fan. These three albums ( I also have on vinyl) are not my favorites but they grow on you. Plus I have friends that love this different style Alice.
3,ONLY BALLADS,"Like the tittle say, this CD contains only great ballads sung (not composed) by DAltrey, who has one the most amazing rockin' voices of all times. But it is only for his mostly dedicated fans, because the ballads are so sugar, with Daltery's work from 1973 to 1980."
3,A Spotty Collection,"Without Pete Townshend writing the songs for him, Roger Daltrey seems very much adrift as an artist. That is dramatically illustrated with this collection in which the quality of the songs varies widely. It starts off with his best three songs as a solo artist, ""A Hard Life/Giving it All Away"" and the pretty ballad ""Without Your Love."" After that it is a hit or miss affair. Most of the material was recorded in the 1970s, and a lot of it lacks the timeless quality of Who recordings and sounds dated. One should also note that this collection does NOT include Daltrey's Townshend-penned 1985 minor hit ""After the Fire.""Overall, not a bad collection for nostolgia purposes, but hardly a vital body of work."
5,So awesome!!!!!!!!,I think that this is the best series that I've read! It's full of really interesting plots and stories and great pictures and always has a happy ending. I totally recommend this series.From Jill's daughter. :)
3,"More than just fairies, rainbows, and missions to rescue...","This series has some magical artwork and some incredibly imaginative adventures within it, that is for sure. However, in addition to the delightful and creative sides to it there is a strong current to NOT be honest with your parents throughout the entire series.[...]"
1,Not recommended,"I purchased several Fairy Chronicles books and intended to read them with my girls. We were looking forward to having fun as the books looked exciting. However, to be honest, my experience with these fairy books was not good. My girls hated Marigold and the other fairy stories. I too found the book dull, tedious and repetitive. Neither the story nor the telling lives up to what I expected. The characters lacked personality and there's not much plot."
1,Absolutely one of the worst,"As a true lover of children's books, I really try to give every book a fair chance but this should never have been published. I regret buying this for my daughter. Sweet's crude attempts at descriptive passages are inept and weak but the shortcomings of this book are trivial in comparison to its mindnumbing plot. Among the most distracting features of the book is the extremely juvenile dialogue. It is understandable that the author would attempt to contrast the children's emotionally immaturity, but instead the children come across as stupid. Avoid this book at all costs."
3,Does what it is suppose to,A little pricy for a charger and bulkier than I prefer but it does exactly what it is suppose to do with no problems and thats really all I ask for something liek this.
3,zune car charger,Product price was awesome and it arrived on time but it is broken. I didnt realize until I had charged my zune completely that it was missing one of the buttons on the side that allow you to remove the charger.
5,Zune Car Charger,"I was a little wary from other reviews that the charger itself would be too bulky and not fit, but it fits and works fine."
5,Zune car charger,Bought it for my ZuneHD and it works great. It causes the battery to heat up a bit which causes the zune to heat up. That hasn't caused any problems for me. Overall it was a good alternative to the $80 version if you don't want the tuner like me.
2,Bad after about a year,"I like the coiled cord, the brand name, the quality, except that it worked fine until about a year later when it just started giving some major noise interferance when plugged in. Luckily, found another one exactly like this one for just $2.95, no shipping because it's Prime and I'm a member, so for that price, sure, I'll get another."
4,Car Charger for Zune,"The charger works wonderfully with my Zune. No complaints thus far. It charges it quickly & somewhat painlessly. The charger's wires are a bit curly, making it difficult to fold and keep out of sight when I exit my car, but other than that, I like the authentic Zune charger.And yes, it is an authentic product from Zune.I haven't found the charger to overheat or the bulb to pop out as of yet and I have had my Zune charge in the car for about an hour at one time. That may not be long enough for the charger to get hot or for the bulb to break, but it doesn't seem made of shoddy material."
3,Works better than the one that came with the car kit,"My Zune car kit charger never quite worked right, this one does. My only complaint is that the cover over the ""in use"" light tends to come off - the glue they used when making it tends to warm up from the bulb and the lens just falls off. Aside from that, it works well for what it's designed to do.Would I recommend? Sure - but I shouldn't have to - the one that came with the car kit should have worked!!! :-)"
2,It's worth a quarter.,"This product is worth the 25 cents that I paid for it.The plastic ""holster"" cradle is contoured to the phone exactly. It also holds the phone snugly without making it difficult to remove. But you wouldn't need to take your cell phone out of this holder anyway because all the buttons and the charger/data port are accessible. Even the camera lens on the back of the phone is usable if you twist the clip sideways.Said clip is the only Achilles Heel of this holster. The spring isn't nearly tight enough to hold it in place. I would be afraid to go running down the street with it on, because the clip would probably come loose. For a very sedentary person, it would be fine.Overall I'd say that this product is worth what I paid for it. But I'm going to look into someway to modify the clip and make it tighter."
4,bedtime stories,This is what i call a good feel movie it shows with a great imagination you can transform into anyone .If you have never had children it's a great way to discover how you feel about bonding through stories whether they are real or imaginitive the movie follows all emotions it's funny'; shows lots of adventure and of course he finds love where he lest expects it this is a wonderful adventure for the whole family where happy endings can come true this is a heartwarming comedy adventure
4,A cute kid's movie,"This is a silly kid's movie, but it was certainly entertaining for kids. In the film, the twists and turns of Adam Sandler's life eerily resemble the bedtime stories he tells his sister's children. The movie actually has a few surprises and genuinely funny moments. However, the movie seems too short and character developments hurried. It is never really clear why, for example, why the two main characters fall in love (they go from hating each other to nearly kissing in the span of a few minutes). I suppose this isn't the most important element for a kid's movie, but better character development might have made the movie appeal to a wider audience."

4,"light hearted, feel good movie","Sure, it was predictable, but if you are just looking for a fun family flick to kick back with and you find Adam Sandler funny, this is a good choice."
4,Very cute and entertaining,"Adam Sandler and his ""friends"" get it right again in a very entertaining and funny movie for the whole family. Children and adults will enjoy it, and be quoting lines to each other for days. I even got Skeeter's ringtone as my own now."
2,"Cute premise, bad movie","This movie has a cute premise and, had it been better executed, could have been a very sweet and funny film. There were definitely moments in it that worked. Unfortunately, many of the jokes fell short and I was not invested enough in the characters to care too much about the plot. The worst part, however, was that the script resorted to using offensive racial caricatures in a poor attempt at humor. For me, that ruined the rest of the movie. I will not be showing this one to my kids."
4,Delightful.,"I am not usually a fan of Adam Sandler's comedies but I found Bedtime Stories to be cute and very creative. This is a children's movie but pretty much any age group will enjoy watching this flick. I am a fan of Keri Russell and Courteney Cox though, these two wonderful actress' are perfect in their roles. This film is part fantasy, part reality and a whole lot of heart. I'm so glad I gave Bedtime Stories a try, enjoy!"
5,Bedtime Stories or Making My Dreams Come True,"It's a great movie filled with laughter, and of love. It's amazing what one will do to make his dreams come true."
3,Giving it three stars for clean family fun,"My girlfriend loves everything Disney, so being a nice guy, I sucked it up and was actually surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. There were several scenes that made me chuckle. It's obvious that this is aimed at kids, so they will likely have a blast. I will admit that some parts were painfully bad and there was quite a bit of poor writing, but that was expected going in.2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars"
4,the magical family comedy by Walt Disney,"the magical family comedy by Walt DisneyIts is a Fun movie for Adult and Childrens .A tale about a man who makes up bedtime stories for his niece and nephew only to find that they magically come true the next day, Bedtime Stories is a funny and enjoyable film about finding happiness in unexpected placesthere are some scenes which are not kid friendly.Overall a Good Movie to watch"
3,Long delivery,The movie took forever to get to my house. Standard delivery does't take over 3 weeks. The payment went through quick so I don't know why it took so long.
1,Incentive to write a review,"I have never really cared enough to write a review, but this movie was so terrible, I decided to actually go out of my way and do so. The concept of Bedtime Stories was pretty original, but the execution was so predictable and awkward that it pains me to know that I paid money and spent 1 1/2 hours of my life which I will never get back.The only bright spot in this movie was Russell Brand, but even he could not save this movie from itself. If you're an Adam Sandler fan, your time would be much better spent watching pretty much any other movie of his other than this one (even Little Nicky or Mr Deeds)."
1,BORING! My Kids Walked Out!,"We saw this movie at a beach resort. Thankfully I did not have to spend money on it!This movie did not appeal to either the adults or the kids watching it!Two of my kids (7 and 9)actually wanted to leave to go up to bed, rather than watch the movie! The next day, they both said that it was boring."
1,"Terrible service, took them longer than a month to ship it and i still DONT have it","I ordered the movie on November 2 and its December 5th and i still DONT have the DVD. i dont know what it is, but i will never use this person again to buy items from. Thats the nicest of a review i could give without being rude."
5,Great Movie!,"The beginning to this movie was kind of boring as they tried to lay down the storyline, wasn't quite sure where it was going. But once the story starts up, the lines are very well written, cute story! Adam Sandler was a little more serious in this one, which i loved and appreciated (im not really a Billy Madison fan)Good story, entertaining, my kids loved it as well. A happy story and ending, and a highly recommended watch for this family movie!"
4,Charming and Sweet,"I really loved this movie. My family went to see it, and even my dad, who is not a particular fan of Disney, admitted that it was funny.Adam Sandler generally scores bad movies, but this one is a special exception. It is witty, funny, cute, and charming.The basic plot line-A man who's truly a kid on the inside who got the low-side of a deal with a hotel owner babysits his niece and nephew who he does not know that well and he realizes that, when he tells them bed-time stories, they come to life... not always exactly as he had expected, though.Amongst a world where true magical movies with no language, sensual stuff, or violence are rare nowadays, and I promise you that Bedtime Stories is one charming movie you'll want in your collection."
4,A Good Family Movie.,"Young children would probably enjoy it the most. But it is good viewing for the whole family. The storyline moves smoothly, so not to lose the interest of adults. It is not a classic, but it is original and it has it's moments."
3,Did'nt work for me....but others should enjoy,"Good movie with a big budget...but for a reason or another the magicjust did'nt work for me... Was it because im used to other charactersthat Adam plays.....Ive talked to other viewers and its a 50/50 thing , half loved it...halfsaid it was ok...but not great."
4,A good laugh!,"I am NOT an Adam Sandler fan, but found this movie entertaining and filled with laughs (without all the foul language normally associated with Sandler). I didn't take the kids to see it because I wanted to check it out first. I will definitely add this movie to our family DVD collection (never thought I'd ever say that about a Sandler flick)! I enjoyed Keri Russell and Guy Pearce in this movie, even though it was weird to see Pearce in a role like this. He was a hoot! Chuckles and out-and-out belly-laughs abound in this silly (but fun) movie"
4,a great feel-good movie,"I wasn't really sure what to expect with this movie, but I was immediately hooked by the charm. It's your typical good versus evil battle with a couple of twists. I rented it and cannot see myself watching it over and over, but would recommend it to anyone who needs a pick-me-up or something to watch with the kids. Courtney Cox Arquette is hilarious as Adam Sandler's uptight sister, which is made even funnier by how laid back Skeeter is."
2,DVD was Defective,"The DVD paused several times, stuttered and I was worried that it wouldn't make it to the end."
4,Review,"The book is full of information and William Shatner gives indepth information on the seven movies and his life in the seventies after the show was cancelled. Not only does he provide his views on the happens of the making of the seven films, but others such as the writers,actors,and the coporate heads of Paramount Studios"
4,Take A Trip Through The Original Films.,"Practically a part two of Memories, Movie Memories takes us behind the scenes in the life and times of William Shatner during the making of all the Star Trek films.It is a good autobiographical account of what Shatner's life was like at the time. After reading these novels I feel like I know the man a little more. His movie death at the end of the novel, during the Generations film brings to a close pretty well my following of the Star Trek franchise. The new cast just does not have the interesting personalities like Shatner and Nimoy. I will miss this cast."
1,More William Shatner fiction.,"This is an entertaining book if you accept the fact that it is largely fiction.George Takei(Sulu)has stated that the William Shatner ""firefighting hero"" of ST3 was a publicity stunt.In truth,the publicity people hurried him down to the soundstage fire for publicity reasons while the real firefightrers fought the blaze.I have thrown my copy away."
3,It's a miracle that the Star Trek movies were ever made!,The ongoing adventures of Captain James Tiberius Kirk as Shatner describes his life from the depressing post-Star Trek TV series days up to the making of the 6th in the series of movies. The recounting of each movie gets a little monotonous but does leave the reader in awe that the bean-counter and the creative egos managed to get it done!
3,"""Captain Kirk"" recalls his theatrical ""voyages""","Forever emblazoned in popular culture as the captain of TV's original ""Star Trek"", William Shatner, along with co-author Chris Kreski, takes the reader on a journey where ""no man has gone before"": that is, the soundstages of each of the seven films in which he was featured as the stalwart captain. From the first, ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", to the transitional ""Star Trek: Generations"", Shatner reveals the backstage drama of film production. He debunks some misconceptions about his ""arrogance"" and makes apologies to those that may have been offended. The author also chronicles how the ""suits"" in the offices of Paramount made some budget changes that, no doubt, played an integral part in the failure of the Shatner-directed ""Star Trek: The Final Frontier"".All in all, the book is a decent read for the true Trek fan; it's not one, however, that bodes well with the uninitiated."
2,Shoulda stood in th' can,"Well, I LOVE this band, have since I caught the ""Last Train to Hicksville"" in '73, BUT............ this is the music to a movie which never got made and although I doubt it was the soundtrack that killed the project it couldn't have helped. I was eagerly anticipating something as compelling as the other fine work with which I was familiar, BUT..... this aint it."
5,So glad I ordered this!,"This CD is classic Dan Hicks (and most of the Hot Licks). The songs are short but snappy. I love ""Crazy-'Cause He is"", that is one of my very favorite Dan Hicks songs (and I have the whole collection). ""Vinny"" and ""Waitin'"" are other classics. The music throughout is great, and includes what must be one of the very few kazoo instrumentals in recording history. If you love Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks--get this CD, it's worth the import price."
3,Decent Middle Volume,"I have to admit middle volumes in any series are generally not my favorite books. Since they are the middle of the story I don't expect closure or climatic endings. What I do look for is interesting character and story development, relevant subplots and enough foreshadowing of the future plot to pique my interest and make me anticipate the next installment. Wolf's Head, Wolf's Heart does this fairly well. It is a good read with a decent plot all it's own. The character development is fair, although there are times when you are left scratching your head and wondering what the author has in mind for some of them.All in all it is worth the read. It may not capture your heart like some books might but it is worth the time and who knows the next installment may just complete it giving us a truly fine story."
2,"Wolf's Head, Wolf's Heart","I was drawn to the first book because I had a long train ride and nothing to do and I happened to enjoy it. This one on the other hand...was disappointing. I usually enjoy long books but this one was stretched too thin. The plot was never ending. I found myself skipping to parts about Firekeeper, (the book is about her right), but she wasn't the main focus very often. Also she doesn't seem to be getting anywhere with language or knowledge. In all the book was never ending and I only finished in case something important happened in the end, which it didn't. I thought the next one in the series would be better but there doesn't seem much hope for that. So, sorry Ms. Lindskold but you are off my authors to go out and by list!"
5,A nice story,"Lindskold's Firekeeper series is a winner. She has created characters I have fallen in love with and who I care what happens to them. The plot was fast paced and exciting. Lindskold's descriptions of the people and places were so vivid (but not drawn out and boring) that I found myself completely drawn into their world, so much so that I was a part of it instead of an onlooker-- what I feel is a mark of a good book. I currently own all four Firekeeper books and I know that if Lindskold publishes another I won't have to take it out of the library before I buy it, I know it will be good enough to buy."
2,A pretty princess costume romance,"Lindskold can write. In fact, she is a pretty good yarnspinner. Unfortunately, this book is a very bad example of her art. This is one of those ""all women must envy and all men must adore the pretty princesses in their beautiful costumes"" type of fantasies, with a tame (and a fierce, and admired, and envied) ""wolf woman"" thrown in for some color and variety. It is beyond me how such an otherwise perfectly competent writer can be compelled to write stuff like this."
3,"Mustek 10"" DVD Player","Picture is great, sound is lousy unless hooked up to H-phones or other sound equipment...The Lid/DVD door was (at first) slightly warped but as time went by it seems to have flattened out.... it had no effect on the unit's playing ability so I didn't return it..I thought the unit could have been less expensive........"
1,"Its just green color + suger, no flavor. Never buy.",Its the worst khus syrup available in USA. Never buy.Try only GuruJi or Haldiram's khus syrup.
3,European influences throughout plus a beautiful surprise.,"Not my favorite Dalida CD but the song ""L'amour et moi"" or ""The Love Inside"" from Barbra Steisands GUILTY is absolutely heart wrenching. At one point you feel the emotion pouring out of her voice. Couple other beautiful songs as well as a couple ""dated""."
1,How?,"As far as I'm concerned, this is unheard of in Rock History.Although no one could ever know, the two Madison Square Garden performances from August 30th, 1972, were John Lennon's last full length live shows. The performances were recorded under Phil Spector's supervision but, apparently, were not intended for commercial release.Then, in 1986, Yoko Ono prepares this now historically important gigs for official release. Somehow she finds out maybe it would be a fancy idea to give this recordings a contemporary 80's look, so she adds ""modern"" production touches, mainly in the sound of the snare drum, making it sound like coming from Brothers in Arms!!!!!!!! Besides, the sound is very flat, like many albums RECORDED in the 80's.This is an atrocity! We can hear some of this recordings in their original form on Lennon's Anthology Box Set, and they sound pretty fine. What the hell were this people thinking? Hey, it is John Lennon!!!!!!! Let's show some respect!"
3,a good time,"This cd is slowly growing on me. At first I did not like, the more I played the more I like."
3,Lennon in 1972,"The sound quality of this record is pretty good but it needs remastered badly like most of Lennon's solo work. Having said that, there are some very good performances here. Mother and It's So Hard are better on this record than anywhere else. Imagine and Instant Karma are also fairly strong. Lennon also throws in a pretty good version of Come Together as well. This is a much better record than Some Time In New York City and if listeners are wanting some more records by John Lennon besides his greatest hits and Imagine, this would be a good purchase but Mind Games and Walls and Bridges are better records. The Live Peace in Toronto is about equal in quality to Live in New York City but Live Peace in Toronto sounds much better because it has been remastered."
3,Not John at his best,"It just seems to me that John was not really comfortable playing the role of rock star on this ablum. He doesn't sing with any real emotion, and the band is sloppy. If only Elephants Memory could have played as well live as they did on Sometime In New York City and Yoko's Approximately Infinite Universe (say what you will about SINYC, the playing and production was exelent). Here John's going through the motions. This CD is comprised of the evening performance. He did an afternoon performance that day that I think was much better, judging from the selections on the JL Anthology. But all in all, this is a flat, impersonal, distant recording. Buy Live Peace In Toronto instead. It's infinitely better."
3,Not a good live performer,"There is no doubt that John Lennon is one of the worlds best musicians but after listening to this I noticed that the songs like Imagine and Instant Karma, even though sound okay on stage can't compete with the studio versions. The whole concert just sounds like it was thrown together at the last minute. So if you want to listen to more of John Lennon's stuff I would recomend Lennon Legend since that has no live recordings and they sound a thousand times better than these live versions."
2,It's hard,"It's hard to put John down, but this cd has some serious... issues. Where to start...Firstly, Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band is comprised of a group of guys who,... They aren't well rehearsed, they aren't good playing together. The sax is all over the place! Every time he plays its just a mess! No subtlety...John is busy screaming. He hardly sings. Its a shame, because he had such a haunting voice. Instead he's just...uck.But on the plus side, Well Well Well is pretty good, and Yoko doesnt do much. Instant Karma is such a tight song, but the drums are all over the place. Those drum breaks are just emberrasing ...John tries to be funny, but it doesnt work.John just wasn't a live artist. In the Beatles and on his own, he didnt seem to like playing live. He was a studio man. He was fantastic in the studio, he wasn't on stage.And Come Together just didnt sound right. None of the songs really sound right. He just can't seem to get into it..."
3,ya gotta know the whole story,"these two concerts were not recorded with the intention of a major release...just a famously famous man recording for posterity. John had been rehearsing a good bit in the few days before the concerts and his voice was a bit ragged by this point. Again, just a couple shows for charity, not a planned release. If you want John at his best live, listen to ""Live Jam"" for ""Cold Turkey"" and ""Baby Please Don't Go"", or watch the Mike Douglas Shows. As it is, we get to hear John performing ""Hound Dog"" much as he would have on a drunken Hamburg night at the Kaiserkeller...just passion."
2,Not the best Lennon around,"I read somewhere that at some point, John had thought of asking Paul to appear on stage with him, since John was so nervous about this performance. Unfortunately, it shows. It reminds of Chuck Berry, how he hires any local band that knows a 12 bar progression and shows up on stage and starts playing. The band here sounds under rehearsed, and the CD sound quality is murky to say the least. The only thing that saves the show occasionally is John voice, but for the most part he is just not into it. 'Hound dog' and 'give peace a chance' are just exercises of self-indulgence that do not desearve a second listen. Also, after listening to some tracks of the other show Lennon performed at the Madison Square Garden, looks like Yoko chose the wrong show to release."
2,Save Your Money,"I thought Lennon was supposed to be a genius. If he was, it really doesn't show in this performance. First, the CD is way too short -- is 11 songs the best they could do? Second, he doesn't sing any of the songs, the entire time John screams the lyrics. Atleast Elvis was kind enough to sing 'Hound Dog.' It almost gives me a headache to listen to him screaming out all these songs. As a matter of fact, the only song he doesn't scream on is 'Imagine.' The third problem is the last song, 'Give Peace A Chance,' is SHORTENED! The full song is 5 minutes, but on this album it fades out after 41 seconds. For shame. Thankfully, however, the complete song is available on the Imagine soundtrack. Otherwise I wouldn't know what to do. All in all, save your money and get the John Lennon Anthology."
3,Ozzy Rocks Hard Live At The Budokan!,"I must say i love Ozzy's music but like i've said before live cds are not my favorite!The track list on this is great & the covers of his songs off of""Down To Earth"" are better than the others! But if you're looking for a live Ozzy cd i recomend this over""Live & Loud""! Ozzy's voice is much stronger on this one!"
4,Live Ozzy,"After seeing bad reviews of this Cd, I found it at Wal Mart for 5 bucks. It's a live show in Japan. It contains a good selection of material from Blizzard to Down to Earth. With one sabbath track thrown in."
3,I expected something else...,"Before you read this, you must know that I'm a huge Ozz fan. This record is NOT what I thought it was going to be. Zakk Wylde isn't playing like he used to do it, and I'm very [angry]that there's no one song of Ozzmosis. It was an amazing record. Ozzy's voice is a little weaker than years ago. But he's Ozzy, and he is great anyway. My favourite songs in this album are Road To Nowhere, Mama I'm coming home (nice riffs!...), Crazy Train and Paranoid. If you don't have yet Live And Loud, buy that album first before you buy this one."
2,"""Live & Loud"" is much much better","If you want a definitive Ozzy live album, go get ""Live & Loud"", the sound quality is much better and you get better songs. ""Live At Budokan"" is nothing more than a quick fix and cash in now that it's ""cool"" to like Ozzy. I remember when if you liked Ozzy people would look at you disgusted and weird, but ever since MTV got hold of him, all of the sudden it's cool to be an Ozzy fan. If you really do like Ozzy and are not just a bandwagon jumper now that he's on MTV, get ""Live & Loud"" which is a lot more bang for your buck."
4,"Hi... WELCOME TO THE BUDOKAN ,YEAH LETS GO F*CKIN WILD TONIGHT","I know people hate this album but I will consider myself a hardcore fan(o and not because i see the show, I have'nt even seen the show but becausegot 15 of his CD's and I know his birthday, but I give this album 4 stars 4being... well, just a great album. (P.S I almost gave it 5 but is it would have f*cked up my ""4"" for being cool) Yes he sounds drunk (nodoubt a'bout it he probably is) but THIS HAS THE VERY BEST RENDISHION OF ""JUNKIE""SO I WOULD GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good, but previous live albums were better","I just bought the video and album of Live at Budokan. I also own Live & Loud on VHS, and I prefer it over Budokan. Don't get me wrong, Live at Budokan is very good, and even has some songs that I haven't heard live (Believer). But, Live & Loud was a bit better in quality and choices for songs. I would have liked it if they played Shot in the Dark or some material from Ozzmosis, like Perry Mason. I would recommend buying Ozzy's other live albums first and then this."
2,...Another live album,"So this is Ozzy's 4th full length live album(and surely not his last). To start off with the positive things first, the performance is really good. Ozzy can still put on a great performance...but that's where it ends. Ozzy has a habit of playing the same songs from Blizzard of Ozz and the same few songs from No More Tears with Paranoid, Bark at the Moon, and usually 1 song from Diary of a Madman. For a man who has as many great albums and songs as Ozzy, I don't see why he doesn't want to play any of them. Diary of a Madman, Bark at the Moon, and The Ultimate Sin(to which isn't represented at all here) are some of his best work. If you want to hear what made Ozzy such a legend in concert pick up Tribute or Speak of the Devil. 2 Classic live albums"
2,???,"First, I don't think this is OZZY's best live album. Speak of the Devil/Just say OZZY are what I think are. Ozzy is a little flat threw this entire album but the crowds energy makes up for it. My favorite song is ""Bark at the Moon."" Second ""Paranoid."" Least ""almost every thing else.""I think this album was released at the worst time ever. Because of every thing that was going on people were getting tired of him and his family.Anyway, this is a decent live album worth a try if your a fan. If your new on the Ozzy seen you should listen to Tribute or Live & LOUD first. Well Im done typing so Bye.O and one more thing if you think you are an Ozzy fan just because you watched the show.....YOUR WRONG!!"
2,Is this Ozzy Osbourne? What's going on??,"I'm a HUGE fan of MTV's hit show ""The Osbournes,"" which I believe will go down in television lore as one of the greatest reality shows ever to grace the tube. Well, imagine my shock when I listened to this hard-rockin' disc, expecting some gentle acoustic ballads, and instead found lovable old Ozzy to be anything but lovable. In fact, there's nothing even remotely acoustic or gentle on this album. And sure Ozzy cuzzes a lot, BUT I DIDN'T THINK HE'D CUZZ IN FRONT OF A LARGE ARENA AUDIENCE IN JAPAN!!!! I don't know, I was just a little disappointed in these songs. Maybe it's time for pudgy little Jack Osbourne to carry the Osbourne family torch. I BET HE WOULD BE A LITTLE ROCKER!! To get his proper start, Jack needs to hit the TRL/Carson Daly circuit. It's a sure bet to supreme success.LATER!!"
1,Here we go again...,"Yet another lame live cash-in attempt. If youre going to come out with a live album, give us material we havent heard before. Ozzy claims to have so much love for his fans, but there is little substance in his stupid comments."
1,Just plain bad,"Ozzy was at the top of his game in the early 80's. Sadly, his music has gone steadily down hill since Randy Rhoad's death. This is a lousy live recording of his glaringly mediocre latter day material, with a couple of oldies thrown in - yet not played very well. Ozzy is washed up.Pick up Tribute or, better yet, get Black Sabbath's Past Lives."
1,Wrong item sent,Ordered white speakers they shipped black. Order clearly stated white on the product description.Box also was marked as black speakers
1,keep looking,"I was looking for a basic speaker to supplement the sound in our auditorium. While these look cool, I could only hear them if I was right next to them. This could be the fault of our sound system, but I think these are just really weak speakers. I am sending these back!"
3,not as listed,"The product works as expected but not as advertised. Amazon has it listed with ""wireless"" speakers. The only thing that is truly wireless is the fact that it takes wires but none are supplied. I think Amazon should be more careful when listing items in categories that they don't belong in."
2,Not very good,My expectations were low as these are only $30 speakers and I was not looking for audiophile sound. I only use them to listen to podcasts and music in a small kitchen but even in this limited application I am disappointed.
3,Speaker sound quality & purchase experience,These speakers are inexpensive and basic. The sound is very dull but acceptable for background music. The purchase was quick and delivery was quick.
3,good for the money,I got what I paid for. Weak low end. But It was a good purchase. I have no regrets at all.
3,"Old ""skool"" kunk fu","This movie is easily a 4 star. Unfortunately, the comedy was too long and dragged on, thus took away from the good of this flick. This flick was comedy after comedy, approximately 75-80% which became some-what boaring.However, there is no qestion about the fight scenes,,,,simply amazing. Yes, I gave this flick a 3 star, but definately a 5 star performace for the fight scenes!! Not a bad idea for the collection!!"
4,small but neat,"I thought I was buying an actual sized messenger bag for my 11 year old son, to use as a backpack.It is a medium purse size at best. So I will have to get him a different backpack, but he does love it, and is playing army with it as we speak :) so I will keep it.overall a Good design, thick material, a great product if you are looking for something in a medium purse sized bag."
3,Small but good,Was not as big as we were expecting but still made a nice small bag to be used as a handbag
2,Quality matches the Price =),"I've been carrying this for almost a month now. and I don't like it. If you don't have books in this, then it's like UN-STRUCTURED. the top doesn't close well at all. and it's just ALL FLOPPY. and when I say ""books"" you better have some SMALL BOOKS. regular books aren't gonna fit b/c it's a small/med purse like thing.I DON'T recommend. Look else where for something that will hold up."
1,Don't bother,If I could give it zero stars I would. This hardly passes for a pillow. Terrible quality and hardly any stuffing at all. This one is definetely going back.
4,A Fine Portrayal by Northam,"I admit that the ""love triangle"" wore a bit thin in this movie, but otherwise it was a superlative piece of film-making. The music is excellent and would be quite enough to recommend this work. However, Northam's realistic portrayal of an actual ""Jeckyll & Hyde"" situation cannot be discounted as one of the films strongest features. An excellent thriller, in which one comes to sympathize with Heseltine/Warlock as ""they"" move forward towards the inevitable tragic end of two personalities inhabiting the same body, each hellbent on destroying the other. Well worth viewing."
4,"Very interesting, even if not entirely accurate","This movie never had a wide theatrical release in the U.S., rather it only played at film festivals where it received rave reviews. Jeremy Northam's performance as composer Peter Warlock and music critic Philip Heseltine earned him great reviews and notice from the casting director of ""The Net"", which began his climb to stardom.The movie is loosely based on the life of British composer Peter Warlock and his arch nemisis, music critic Philip Heseltine. In addition to an interesting story and wonderful performances, the viewer is treated to great classical music. The only disappointment in the movie is the fabricated love triangle between Heseltine, Warlock, and Heseltine's girlfriend (so forgettable, I can't remember her name)."
3,Voices From a Locked Room -- VHS video,"This film is not available in DVD format and I suppose I was lucky to find it at all. Rather poor quality, a used Blockbuster video. But the seller was very honest about the condition and the price was low. So, I am satisfied!"
1,out of sync and sleepy,"The most annoying thing is the editing, the fingerings Chuck plays don't line up with the sound. On the rare occation that it does it looks weird cuase you've gotten use to seeing it out of sync. I buy live DVD's for the live experience and this doesn't give it. I also found most of the songs to be slow and laid back more than I'd like, liven it up a bit. Overall not my favorite show. Not a bad review of Chuck himself, he did fine, but the production value was lacking, thus the low rate."
1,Chuck Mangione: The Feeling's Back,Very Poorly done. The sound and picture does not line up together. The video has a delay over the sound.Not good. Would not recommend.
2,"SONGS TITLES ARE BORING, IT IS NOT CHUCK'S STYLE","I enjoy chuck's music when I purchased his albums of "" Feel So Good "" "" Chase The Clouds Away "" which are my favorites. This DVD encoded with 96KHz, 24 Bits best sounding with my DVD player and I would not ask more. However, every titles in the disc are plain with the simultaneous outdoor video taking of scenes in urban city which is unnecessary."
5,high quality with geat price,"This works great with my Sony Cybershot or may say it's even better than my original battery charger set. The battery holds longer charge then before. Till now, I have no problem with it. Good one!"
1,old raisins,Terrible. They are old and clumped together. I'm eating them with my cereal just because I don't want to throw away money. Will never buy these again.
2,Sugar Coated Raisins...?,"I have been buying Newman's Organic Raisins for some time, but I have aways purchased the 15 oz round container and I love them. I decided to buy the 6 oz foil packages, because they would be easier to put in a backpack.The problem is that they taste like there is a coating of crystalized sugar covering most of them. I would not buy these again."
5,A jewel of wisdom and love,"Ken Ginsburg has quite possibly the biggest heart of anyone I have ever met in pediatrics. He is my mentor and friend, and has taught me so much about how to help adolescents develop their own resilience, cope with the incredible stress and trauma of growing up today, and developing to their fullest potential. In this book, Ken masterfully synthesizes the state of the art research in adolescent development and resilience, and combines it with his own experience and deep love for adolescents, to offer us all a roadmap for working with our youth with love, wisdom, and skill. Work like this gives me hope for our future as a society.Dzung Vo, MDPediatrician and Adolescent Medicine specialist"
5,We loved it!,Building Resilience in Children and Teens is a very practical book with pragmatic ideas and solutions. We will reference this book over and over!
4,Cool!!,"Definitely not an Enigma album, but a must have for Enigma fans.It's great to hear some covers AND originals from Jens Gad andMichael Cretu."
3,Somewhat typical techno,"This CD isn't one I'll listen to over and over again. The novelty of this slow moving CD wears off quickly similar to one of Cretu's other ""pre-Enigma"" CD entitled ""The Invisible Man"". If you want a better Cretu CD, skip this one and buy his Enigma CDs."
5,designed to be like Him,This is the best treatise of the book of Romans chapters 6 and 8 that I have ever read
4,seiko,"its a nice watch. feels that it will last a fair amount of time. didnt use it, was a gift, do believe its fair quality. looks really nice when worn and does fine as a gift. The band is streching, if you have a big wrist it may build discomfort."
2,it was nice watch,"I was love this watch. I was have exacly same watch for about 4 years. It's look perfect and work exelent in any conditions. No one can belive it's not realy gold watch. But, couple months ago watchband bock down on midle. I don't think long time. 4 years is big time life for under $100 watch and I get new one from amazon just couple months ago. Exacly same. Perfect look. Brand new. I bin happy. But, new watchband bock down on midle again. Just on couple month. Thas is saler respond: ""Please be advised that the watchband is not covered under the warranty"". It's just under 2 months old item! Too bad. Without original watchband this watch... nothing. Seiko, where yours legendary quality? I'm done with this brand. You don't? Good luck."
3,looks preety,"It looks just as the pictures shown on the website.Very easy to assemble.For the price it is a good value.However there is a very big design fault which I had to fix by adding extra nails to it.In the door there is a magnetic latch system to gently close the door but the problem is when you pull the door open even with a gentle tug the shelf comes out or falls down.That is a big drawback and so I had to fix it by inserting extra nails to keep the shelves stable.Inserting extra nails from outside is easily visible which dosent look good,but there is no choice.Other than that I am very happy with the product.I had several nails missing about which I emailed the seller and they sent me the hardware within 3-4 days.That was nice gesture."
5,'Holding The Center' is a great read.,"This is a very intimate story of the author growing up and 'becoming'. He excellent writing style made me not want to put the book down, and the message and inspiration were priceless. That alone is well worth the price of the book, and the time spent reading it.Add to that some real quality information that is helping me calm my mind while at the same time achieve my goals in life. I'm learning that real power and fulfillment can be a very relaxing endeavor."
5,Simply The Best,"Tina Turner delivers yet another impeccable album with this 1986 album. Songs are upbeat, fun, diverse, and offer a variety of pop, rock, and soul. A must have for all Tina fans!!"
5,A CLASSIC THAT CAN STAND PROUDLY BESIDE Private Dancer,"This album is one of the classic pop/rock albums of the mid-80s. My question is, Is this album truly re-mastered and re-issued--as it is labeled by Amazon here? I purchased this supposedly remastered album to replace my original cd copy, but nowhere on the disc or booklet does it mention a remastering. Has anyone else noticed this?"
5,Excellent,"I'm very pleased with this product - however, I am ALWAYS pleased with everything that I have ordered from Amazon. I only order through Amazon now because I trust it's service and products to always be excellent. Thank you !"
3,Basic bird book,It does have the basic birds of Pennsylvania and it does group them according to color for faster identification but it only has one picture per bird and maybe showing different angles of the bird might help in identification.
5,Easy to use.,"The main color of the birds is used as a sorting method; just turn to the ""blue"" section to find the name of the ""blue"" bird you saw, etc. Good for beginning birders."
2,Similar,"Having bought the album, I found that the tracks on it are the same as on Beginnings, though in a different order."
1,Save your money,"I was very disappointed in this album, I purchased it thinking it was a new CD, but it was recorded several years ago. It's very 80s with drum machines and synthesizers. The sound quality is poor. Definately not the Shania of today."
1,Not worth the wait,"After anxiously waiting many long months Wild & Wicked finally just arrived. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! All the cuts are old style Shania, NO country, back from long before her tallent blossomed into the excellant singer she is today. Save your money."
1,Don't bother,Don't bother buying this CD. These songs are good but they were recorded before her more familiar country style songs. If you're a Shania fan and want to get some of her early recordings I would suggest buying The Complete Limelight Sessions CD as the sound quality on it is better and it has all the same songs that are on this CD and more for the same or less money.
2,duplicate,"""Wild and Wicked"" is the same cd as ""For The Love Of Him"". Don't make the mistake of buying both, thinking you are getting two different cd's."
4,Love it,"This album is pretty good. Her vocals sound like a preppy girl trying to act tough. The remixes are higher quality than other versions other versions that have flooded the market and have been advertised as sanctioned official albums that are released this decade. Buy it if you are a true fan, or if you like low budget 80s music."
1,Wrong Item,"The Sensor i have request is the same as the picture, but the one they send to me is a different one. (will not fit on my car)."
3,a very colorful book,this book shows lots of beautiful butterflies. it was a very intersting and educational book. a recommend this book very much.
1,Who's the baboon?,Why would anyone write a biography of a historic figure and use a cartoon of a baboon on the cover? Can that be the face of the author?I doubt that the greatest general and statesman of ancient times looked like a baboon. More likely it's a leftist biographer.Don Norton
4,Excellent textbook and workbook in one!,"Let's Learn Kanji is systematic, it gives you a wealth of basic kanji knowledge (including stroke order and radicals) as well as providing space to practice AND regular worksheets/mini tests so you can monitor your progress! Often kanji books offer only examples and written explanations, or focus soley on repeated written practice. The addition of the mini tests for consolidating your learning makes this book a must have. I studied some kanji previously but found my self directed study slow. While I agree with the other reviewer that the pace seem stedious at first, I after a month I can claim some serious progress! My only concern with this text is that from time to time the mini tests do not have an answer key. All in all an excellent book for self study by motivated beginners!"
3,Not for use as primary text,"If you don't know any kanji, don't get this book. If you know 100 or or more kanji, this book might be useful as a supplement. Most kanji books group kanji into useful groups that you can learn and put to use right away. This book, however, groups kanji by stroke count and teaches those that become radicals for other kanji. Rather than a kanji textbook, this book is more of a reference on proper stroke type and character formation (which is its strength). As a kanji textbook, though, it's a bit like learning to read English by first learning all the one-letter words, then learning the two-letter words, etc. regardless of usefulness (or learning all the words beginning with ""a"" before learning those beginning with ""b"", etc.). So, a good reference but get something else to follow a course of study."
5,Fantastic,"As other of the same collection, this book is amazing and with little knowledge you can learn for sure!I strongly recommend!"
5,"Disturbing, Moving and Heartbreaking","This documentary is wonderfully made. It is dark and moving and shows the plight of these children like nothing else I have come across. Please share this with your friends, family and organizations to help spread the word about these children."
2,Do not waste your money,"What a waste of money, it was really disappointing, not necessary with the subject, but with the presentation, directing, cinematography and the rest..."
2,Seager,"Not their best. tried to fit into the 80's and went away from what they do best, good old Rock and roll"
4,silver songs by bob seger,one of the best albums i have in my collection. by my self i`ve got 10 albums off bob seger. I hope that i can buy a lot more off him. but I live in holland and the music store`s here the never heart off him and thats a shame. [....]
5,The U.S. may owe Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band more than it knows . . .,"When IRS had destroyed everything I worked all my life for, and driven from me all I cared about, I fought with myself lest I let the monster I was fighting make of me a monster. One night, in the Arizona desert on a WalkMan radio, I heard ""like a Rock."" It made all the difference."
3,Bob the pitchman,"In retrospect, the title track and best song on ""Like a Rock"" was ready made to be the television commericial for trucks it has become so closely identified with. (Sort of like how Carly Simon's ""Anticipation"" came to represent ketchup). Smooth and polished, with no sharp edges in either the music or the lyrics, the song ""Like a Rock"" is a pitchman's dream. And therein lies the problem. While it isn't a bad song or album, it lacks the rawness and the passion that Bob Seger brought to his earlier work (like ""Night Moves"" and ""Live Bullett""). Once upon a time, Seger was a true original who could sing rings around the best of them. Since then, he got complacent and the results, while not awful, are not up to his own high standards."
1,bob seger cd.....Id like my money back!,"im very upset!! i had no idea i was purchasing a COPY of this cd..which is really ok.the problem is that the seller didnt let me know, and the label that was put on the cd itself wasnt stuck on correctly...i played it in my car and was thrilled...tried to take it out of my car stereo, and no cd would come out....i had no idea what was wrong...the player would not play at all...its a 6 cd changer and just kept showing an error message...i spent days trying to get the cd out with out having to go to the dealer..i finally got it out but not without ruining the cd..i had to use a piece of plastic and shove it in the front of the player...so im just lucky it didnt damage the player itself...and sure enough..nicely torn cd label came out with cd...next time..try just writing on the cd instead of the labels...i had searched and searched for that cd..i got to hear it once, and now its toast and i wasted my money!!"
4,"Not their stongest album, but still good.","Bob Seger is one of those bands that makes good rock and roll what it is. He is truly origanal and easily one of the best. Like a Rock is far from his best album, but it is still great. All The songs here are top notch. 'Like a Rock' is easily the best song on the album, with its great lyrics, and Segers great vocal delivery, and that guitar solo oh, that guitar solo is one of the top five slide solos ever recorded! Other stand out tracks are 'Miami', and 'American Storms' both of which are Seger classics. The silver bullet band sounds great here, and Bobs vocal delivers once again sounds great on everytrack here. There are no real classics here except for the title track 'Like A Rock' and that is why this was only a 4 star album instead of a 5."
4,Nice and secure,"I purchased this holster because for the Px4Storm Compact, there really isn't any holsters made for it yet. I like the holster. It holds the gun well, guards the trigger and is made with hard sturdy plastic. I have difficulty removing the pistol at times. You have to give it a good pop when removing it to get the plastic to release.I know someone that has the Beretta holster made by Beretta and this holster (the one made by Fobus) is more slender and is hugged closer to your waist. I can conceal with this if I have a large jacket where the name-brand Beretta holster sticks out pretty far and is not good for concealing.This would get 5 stars if I didn't struggle getting the pistol out of the holster at times. The fit is almost too good."
2,Disappointing.,"Even with the most extreme adjustments, holster will not readily release FNX40 pistol for which it was recommended. Indent for trigger housing appears to be too deep, requiring much more than acceptable effort to remove it from the holster. Highly recommend a different holster for the FNX40."
4,Satisfied customer,"I purchased this for my husband. He is satisfied with it once he figured out why the pistol was sticking in the holster. He had to loosen a screw in the side before the gun would release. Once he fixed that issue, it works good. He carries it everyday."
2,Nice but not for the FNX 9,"It seems to be a decent holster, fits comfortably, probably works fine with the PX4 for which it is explicitly designed. But there are serious issues with the FNX-9 for which it is also marketed.The FNX-9 frame extends beyond the bottom of the holster and with it the last two ""teeth"" of the accessory rail. If you apply any torque on the draw, a rail tooth will catch on the bottom of the holster. As a result either 1) the gun does not draw or 2) the gun is drawn with the holster still attached.If the ""sheath"" into which the frame fit was a bit longer, this holster would be a much better fit for the FNX-9. As is, the product is difficult to recommend for FNX owners."
2,unholstered,molded custom fit holster; gun w its factory sights didnt fit in holster securely. molded seams had sharp edges; maybe seconds. req left handed and recg right.returned
4,great,It is as good as advertised. It actually fits my PX4 Storm subcompact and it is very comfortable. So far it seems pretty sturdy.
5,Best tribute album I've heard,I'll keep it short and sweet: This is the only tribute album I've ever heard that doesn't blow and that I still listen to on purpose. Feels like the Replacements.
3,Coffee Table Time,"Some books look great...color pictures and carefully placed text in short readable formats. This is that type of book. Beautiful photographs and brief paragraphs here and there. Perhaps this would better suit a video or retrospective program. For me, it was pleasant, but not much in the way of substantive, insightful material to help me better understand this marvelous person."
4,An effective and unique wine stopper,"I first found a stopper like this in Spain at a winery, and was delighted to find one similar in the States -- effective at preserving the freshness with no danger of breaking off the cork!"
5,wooooooooooooo ow,this is the bomb cd and i love the song if she only knew.......everybody who likes things like nsync(i do)and bsb(i do too)should also get this cd(98degrees and rising)of course if they already havent...hehe woooooo ow
5,98 degrees is at their best in this CD.,I love this it. The songs are fabulous. I listen to them almost every day. I would give them two thumbs up!!!
2,Not that great...,"98 Degrees are great singers! But I'm kind of disappointed w/ their new album. It's not that good. After listening to their CD 2 or 3 times, I already got tired of it. I still say that ""The Invisible Man"" is their best song ever! Nice try, guys! Maybe your next album will be better than this, I hope!"
1,oh god not again!,"I could have went to the other thousand boy band sites to display my disgust, but 98 degrees is the lucky winner. Needless to say this album will make you go nuts. It's like that small ticking in the corner of a dark room while you sleep and you can't figure out what it could be. I liked New Kids On the Block, but come on hasn't this gone too far? This album is like a thousand small needles slowly injecting themselves into my ophthalmo (eye). If you like this cd why not buy Backstreet Boys and N'Sync and Five and Menudo... the list goes on. Why can't it just end?"
3,its an average CD put out by an average group....,"I'm sorry to say but this CD just lacked something that groups like NSYNC have..is it enigma? they lack that special ""spark."" This CD did not even meet any of my expectations..and they need to work on their vocal skill..ex, PROJECTING their voices..in some songs, their voices sound muffled, and I think they just lack the talent.."
4,This cd is great!,I love this cd. At first I really wasn't crazy about it. Then I started to listen to the words a little more carefully and I think they songs are so pretty. I love the song I Do(Cherish You) and Still. They are great songs. The words are very pretty. It's a great cd.
4,Young Stars Rising to the Top,"98 degrees, a young, new, hot group with their album entitled ""98 degrees and Rising"" is a spectacular album, featuring their top songs ""Because of you"" & ""The hardest thing."" With these hot new guys rising to the top, they are bound for success and the top of the charts. This cd is a great, pop charting cd!!"
1,UPDATED BOYZ II MEN?,They sound like updated versions of Boyz II Men (whom I detest also). none of these Boy Bands can sing accapello or however you spell it so give it up. KEEP AWAY FROM THE ATROCITY OF THIS ALBUM!
3,Ahh!!,"I can't get that stupid intro to ""You're My Everything"" out of my head. All these years later!! It's driving me INSANE!!"
2,Fair,98 Degrees has a beautiful front man (Nick Lachy) and 2 of the others are pretty good looking but that's about it. They don't have a unique sound and while I Do is a beautiful song for a wedding that's about the only reasn to have this CD. I am just glad I got mine as a gift!
5,Great harmonizing! (added bonus: hot pics of Nick!),"This CD is great! I absolutely LOVE ""The Hardest Thing""! It's one of my all time favorite songs: and the rest of the CD is almost as good. I'd really recommend it to anyone, even if you think boy bands are so-so."
2,Fanatics only please!,"This cd is not very good.Only fans of the 1st cd should buy this and you should like the 1st one A LOT.Other wise just stick with the singles, they're the only good cuts on the cd."
2,It was okay,"I thought the CD was good, but not great. Some of the songs were kind of weak and some were just plain sucky. As a 98 Degrees fan, I was dissapointed because I know they could do a lot better than this. I don't think people would be pleased with this CD."
1,This is so funny!!!,"I can't believe I'm actually partaking in reviewing a ""boy band,"" but I couldn't help. I have nothing really to say about the band or the album because I haven't heard it(nor do I intend to). I just think it's incredibly amusing to read all these silly comments made by teenage girls (or boys, but to a lesser degree). It's like they live on a different planet where everything is trite and inane!! But one particular ""review"" is worthy of a special mention -- the one from a Connecticut girl on February 6. I mean, is that not one of the funniest (unintentionally, I'm sure) things ever? Somebody should save it and show it her, say, ten years from now. If she is matured by that time, I'm sure she'd be stunned how much air she had in her brains. I mean freaking out over Boy Bands is silly enough, but to author a gem like this?! Truly priceless!! Belongs to the Museum of Female Teenage Hysteria Over Completely Worthless and Manufactured Boy (or Girl) Bands."
1,more like 32 degrees,"This Cd just wasn't that good.""Because Of You"" should have been thrown off the bridge that was featured in the video. ""The Hardest Thing"" I had to do was listen to this Cd."
4,A cut above other groups of the genre,"Maybe it's because they're a Motown group and not part of the 'Jive' factory that these guys are a cut above the average boy-band, teeny bopper groups. They have a more mature sound that appeals to all ages. Plus they help write a lot of their songs, and you don't find them dancing all over the stage either. Their vocal harmonizing ranks up there with the best of the genre, and I have a feeling that these guys will outlast The Backstreet Boys and N'Sync. But of course, time will tell. The highlight of the album is the beautiful accapella version of ""She's out of my life"" which seems the perfect follow up song to come after ""The Hardest Thing"". Worth the price of the cd just for those 2 songs...brilliant!!"
5,98 DEGREES HEAT IT UP!! AND THE TEMPERATURE IS RAISING!!!,"98 Degree's is my favorite group. I love this album. I would highly recommend it. Its got some slow danceing songs and some fast dancing one. Can't wit intil they come out with a new one. 98 DEGREES HEAT IT UP!! AND THE TEMPERATURE IS RAISING. -Jessica, Georgia"
5,This CD is the best one so far!,"This is the first CD that I do not regret spending about $15 on. I only skipped two songs on the ENTIRE CD because I'm not into depressing songs, otherwise it's a great CD. My favorite song is ""Fly with Me"" because it sounds great. If you listen to any review, listen to mine. Buy it. You'll regret it if you don't."
3,"TALENTED GUYS, GOOD MUSIC, AND A FUTURE.","98 Degrees are a good band, not like most boy bands. They have great harmonizing, vocals and are easy on the eyes.This CD is a good compilation of ballads, however they tend to wear a little thin after a while sounding like all the other boy bands. The thing that makes 98 Degrees standsout are their voices. They could sing over N Sync & Backstreet Boys anyday with their ranges.However I would like to see 98 Degrees rock a little and take their ballads a new direction with more strings, and a little less sappy.All together though this is a good album. Songs to listen for are ""I Do"" a great song for newlyweds, ""The Hardest Thing"" and ""Do You Wanna Dance"""
5,A great Cd for all ages!,I think that everyone would like this album. The songs are great and the voices blend together beautifully! The guy's should really be proud of this Cd!
5,The BOMB!!!,"This is the best CD I have ever bought. These four guys really know how to sing. The songs on this album make your heart mealt. And there looks are totally hot. Where else could u find a band this hot? Nowhere, that's why they're named 98 Degrees."
5,HOT!,"Need I say more? These guys are hot. Maybe even better than the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync put together! The great sound of harmony flows through each of their songs especially ""She's Out of My Life"". Not only are the songs and sounds great but so are the guys. A must for every CD collection!"
3,A day of Heat,"I think this cd has plenty of good, clean, cut music and that is what we need around here for kids young and also i like this cd because the guys have great 6 packs! I think that they are very good singers"
3,Great voices but not enough good songs,98 degrees is a great group with great people with loads of talent and lovely voices. The songs on their album are satisfactory. The writing is not that good I must say. I love the song I Do since it is just so beautiful. Thats basically the only song I listen to. Something that you'd be better off getting the single than the album. I just hope that their next album has better writing since they deserve top quality songs for them to sing. Good gift for any lady both young and old since it has a lot of love songs and great for teens. Not something that you'd play through the whole CD and love it. Something that you'd skip through the bad songs and only play one or two.
4,Surprisingly good...,"First off...i should probably say that i don't like boy bands...in fact, i really get sick when i hear some of them, but i was sort of surprised by 98 degrees. Oddly enough, they actually sound quite mature and could--with only a little more maturing--be a very praiseworthy group indeed (though they are already praiseworthy now). Their tightly knit harmonies and the fact that they helped write nearly half the songs on the album put them in a class above other so called ""boy bands"". I was pleasantly surprised...you will be too. Pick it up!"
5,Pure Talent,"This album is great. Here's what I think on each song 1. Intro-Nothing speical 2. Heat It Up-This song is really great not too slow but not too fast 3. If She Only Knew-Great ballad 4. I Do (Cherish You)-I love this song awesome ballad they really show their voices here great job 5. Fly With Me-Very good song 6. Still-Nice ballad 7. Because Of You-One of my fave songs they show their Harmonize here 8. Give It Up (Interlude)-Nice acapalla 9. Do You Wanna Dance-Not my fave song but still nice 10. True To Your Heart - (featuring Stevie Wonder)-This is definatly my fave song togther with stevie wonder they created a brilliant song 11. To Me You're Everything-Great song 12. Hardest Thing, The-Excellent ballad 13. She's Out Of My Life-Nice song"
5,THE BEST CD EVER!,THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE CD! 98 DEGREES ARE THE BEST BOY BAND OUT THERE. I LOVE ALL THERE SONGS AND THEY ALL HAVE GREAT VOICES. I THINK THAT EVERYONE WOULD ENJOY THIS CD. I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR AGE IS.
1,COME AGAIN?,"98 degrees, I'm sorry boys but this is bad-really bad! My music center sent me 98 Degrees and Rising, and after listening to the whole cd I only liked 2 songs-but how many times can you listen to those 2 songs before you become SICK of them?! Now, this over-priced cd sits in my room(I got Millennium for cheaper and it sounds a hundred times better than this cd!!!!)collecting dust! It's a cryin' shame because after I discovered Backstreet Boys I almost bought your first cd. But this second cd is garbage! No wonder your chart position is so low. Pleeeaaassssse, Come Again!!!!"
3,Nice voices,"I'm not really in to boybands right now, but this is a pretty good CD. These guys have beautiful harmonies, and I love ""The Hardest Thing"". ""Heat It Up"" is probably my second-favorite."
5,COOL,98degrees is the bomb becouse there nice and they have good music. I just go here at amozon.com and listen to them and I get ready to party.
3,"More ""X"" then Back Street Boyz","Even though their music is better then ""ok"".But to girls,""hot hints and smile"" are the focus.Most of all,they equip with ""The Hardest Thing"".You can have one!!!"
2,two star just for.....,Two star just for (Because of you). it's cool song. and if you like this kind of music just try to here Boyzone and I believe that you gonna like it because there are the best band in the world.
1,Ya for real????? They can't sing!,"Corny beyond words, only one good track ""Fly With Me"" the rest, I dislike very.I'd reccomendAvril LavigneAshlee SimpsonOr Even N'SyncBut not this trash!"
1,Suckers!,"If I could give any CD by these guys a zero, I would. This is basically due to the fact that this is not music, it is record executive product designed to prey upon the mindless public's addiction to unabridged cheezy music. This genre of music is so manufactured that it's motives are highly questionable.The unfortunate thing is that a lot of these singers actually have some vocal talent and they become pawns in the recording industry's money machine.Take one look and move on."
1,Yawn,Let me just say that I'm not a hater of boy bands or pop music. I like pop actually and some boy bands' songs. I just happen to think that this particular band makes really boring music with no beat and no really special vocals. Nothing about this CD sets it apart accept for it's extreme blandness.
4,Rock on!,"The second disc by 98 Degrees was the first one I bought. I really like the sound of their voices, and The Hardest Thing was one of my fave songs. The fastest song here is To Me You're Everything, another fave. The rest of the CD is mostly ballads, but they don't sound like boring boy band ballads, the songs have depth and meaning, not to mention that Justin, Jeff, Nick and Drew have the best voices I've ever heard. I'm sure you'll agree with me once you hear their version of Michael Jackson's She's Out Of My Life. Their shimmering harmonies blend together perfectly, which is also apparent on the other tracks. Buy this disc and surprise yourself!"
5,Not your average 'boy-band',"I recently purchased this album on a whim, having heard a couple 98* songs on the radio, and I am thoroughly impressed. I have outgrown the age-old fad of the 'boy-bands', like the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync, and would like to assure anyone who is over age 17 that 98* are NOT one of them. They are four talented men who have beautiful voices and are able to express emotion through their music. The album itself is excellent, with many great songs, some being stronger musically than others, but overall a really good buy. :)"
3,More like three and a half stars,"This CD was okay. I like their voices and they have talent. And yes, they are cute! The only thing I didn't like was all the sampling. I know everyone else does it but that doesn't make it right or cool. The song where they sampled that Kool & the Gang song...yuk, and the other song where the sampled some Earth Wind & Fire song, and yet ANOTHER song where the sampled something else. Finally, that She's Out of My Life version wasn't any of that. Dudes should just stop trying to make that song over because no one can do it like Michael. Anyway, back to 98 Degrees...their original songs are great. I love The Hardest Thing, I Do, Fly With Me, Because of You, and True to Your Heart--those are all good. They should stick with their own original material, though. They have enough talent to do their own stuff."
5,Great!,"It was a very good CD. It was neat because there were lyrics with the CD and if you did not catch what some words they are saying in some songs, then it comes in handy."
4,BETTER Than the First,"Definitely better than the first album. I did not like them at first since I tend to compare them with BSB and NSync; however, this CD certainly has shown that they are not like the other two teenie-boopers group (which irritate me to death what with their fashion geared for the young ""marketeres""). I would compare 98 to Boyz II Men although both groups have different talents. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants some real music and not jumpy, in-the-air tunes from Spears, BSB, and Nsync (although I must add they DO have catchy tunes)."
5,I LOVE THEM!,"98 Degrees is a wonderful group that work well together. I have seen them perform live, and I have met them and their personalities are as great as their music. Forget about BSB, 5ive, or N'Sync, 98 Degrees is going to be around for a long time, I asure you of that!"
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this CD because of The Hardest Thing and also Because of You. I was suprised to find that this is a pretty good Cd. Not amazing, but no really horrible songs. However, the songs do resemble each other a lot. Other than that, I'd recomend this to anyone who doesn't want to buy N SYNC's poor excuse for a debut CD. By the way, this is a bug improvement for 98 Degrees over their first album."
1,Suckz like no other,"All shallow teenage girls listen: You will love these guys! they have no talent, no lyrical abilities, and cant dance! They do however have what you love, which is a whiny voice, a pretty face, and a good melodic song(which they didnt write) Remember Leif Garret? well, he is ridiculed now, and so will all teeny boppers in 10 years"
1,Wow! New Kids On The Block cloned themselves!,"Now we know that human clones do exist. I've noticed only four NKOTB clones are here, but that's because Donnie Wallberg went into an acting career. Other than that, it's cool to see that NKOTB decided to prolong their careers an extra 15 min. through cloning. Of course, the music is incredibly awful as usual - all who seek intelligent, soul searching, and meaningful songs, stay away."
5,da best,I luv this cd! It is da bomb and even though Nick Lachey is dating Jessica Simpson HE IS STILL MINE AND ONE OF THE HOTTEST GUYS ON EARTH! The cd is the bomb so what are you wating for just buy the cd already!
4,Lacoste,I had been looking for this. J C Penny's used to have it but I could not find it there. I am glad I was able to find it on line.
5,"It's P.G Wodehouse, Dudes! What more do you need to know?","Classic Jeeves and Wooster, and a lot of stories in one collection. The clever, witty, slightly screwey situations we've come to know and love."
1,Very poor,"We found this book virtually a copy of the Claris manual in it's content. If Claris confuses you, then this book will confuse you in exactly the same manner."
2,Just a Joke,I bought this item for a bachelor-party for my brother in law as a expensive Joke!What a boring thing.
1,This cannot be a PEER reviewed book...SURELY,"I have read this book, more than once.I think most of the articles contained must be at least 10 years out of date and have no relevance in todays evidence based medecine, it seems to be made up of hearsay and conjecture....The forword was interesting written by a friend ! I dont think the contents of this book could stand being peer reviewed today, and I don't think it could have even when it was published, I would say this book is what it is; JUST A BOOK. Made up I would say, part if not all of peoples medical records supplied supposedly by other doctors who having ""I would say"" the same if not similar views to the author, theories well out of date...for example Southall, Meadow and MSbP....I would like to find out if this book, sorry the materials contained therein have ever been peer reviewed. I dont think so !.. poor book."
3,Keep trying,"Having a lot of familiarity with the oil industry, I read this book wondering if the modern industry could provide the setting for a good story. After finishing ""Offshore,"" there's no doubt that it can--the premise of a winner-takes-all corporate bet over the industry's deepest offshore wildcat well is a great one. And I applaud the author for the plotline on this first endeavor.However, the story is hampered by pedantic dialogue treatments, proofing hiccups, and some transitions that were unsatisfactorily abrupt (especially the ending)--all of which could have been assisted by an experienced fiction editor. I wanted to be engrossed in the plot but was distracted by lack of polish in the text. Please try again with more help, Mr. Corace. . . your story deserves to be a better read."
3,Good First Effort,"'Offshore' is a good tale about intrigue in the offshore oil industry.I believe this was the author's first novel and it read like it. Although the story had great potential, it was hampered by having too many subplots, some of which were just not believable.The author clearly has a lot of knowledge about the industry and does a good job of providing some insight into it. He also has good plot ideas and decent character development. He just does not tie it all up in a package that is polished."
4,Cute Movie! A little different and worth watching.,"I saw this movie a while ago and I know that it didn't get that many great reviews at the box office, but I thought it was really cute, romantic comedy and it didn't fail to deliver. The story is a bit different, I enjoyed the subtle humor and think the young actors did a great job. I would watch this movie over and over again for the cheese factor :)"
5,Breathtaking.,There are no words to express the magnificence of Mr. Hopes' prose. I came upon a copy accidently and have read and enjoyed it more than any other book in my vast library. This is a book that truly should be re-issued. David Brendan Hopes is a literary gift to be treasured.
4,Excellant product,This Emjoi Hair remover is really nice. If your in a hurry this is awesome to use! Definitely a plus from using razors.
3,It would be best used on the East Coast of N. America,"The vast majority of the species in this book are found only on the east coast. Makes it very disappointing to this west coast resident. Unfortunately it is the only book I could find of its type. I will be using it as a reference for my own mushroom dying experiments. One of my more nit picky complaints is that it doesn't mention whether the particular mushroom is mycorrhizal or not. This is important to me because I want to grow the dye mushrooms, and you can't do that with mycorrhizal ones.So, it's okay, a little disappointing, but okay."
4,Very useful reference for the person who wants to try natural dyeing utilizing mushrooms.,I would have liked a bit more information on the parts of the country/world where specific mushrooms aremfound. i can hardly wait until spring in new England brings the opportunity to experiment with these mushrooms.
5,Great Stuff! But then what did you expect from Bob Seger?!?,Great renditions and some songs never released from a studio recording. Very true to form and full of energy!
5,THE REAL BOB SEGER,"""Nine Tonight"" provides a snapshot into the sound of a 1980s concert by Bob Seger. It is filled with all of Seger's hit songs plus many lesser known ones that fans appreciate.It is a superior record to ""Live Bullet"" which is a very good record but this CD contains all of the big hits from Seger's biggest records late 70s and 1980 plus a live version of ""Night Moves"" that is better than the studio version.It also provides a different intro to ""Ole Time Rock n Roll"" that Seger didn't perform in the 1986-1995 concert tours. The album is a blend of 1975-81 Seger material that has become legendary over the years, which makes it the strongest Seger album currently available to the public.If you wanted to buy one Bob Seger record, this is the one to buy. It combines the best songs from his best albums. You will miss some of material from the mid-1980s and 1990s but this album represents the essence of Bob Seger."
5,Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band,"This tape was my running companion for years, I finally wore it out and was happy to find it again on a CD from Amazon. I don't run anymore but remember all the good times at road races when I listen to it. Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, my all time favorite!"
4,Why not release all of the original album?,"This is an excellent album as far as a good sampler of Bob's music at the time, and his great abilities as a live artist.My only problem is with the editing of the original release for cd. In my opinion, the best performance on the original album was ""Brave Strangers"" and it's not even here. And why edit the last cut on the disc? Yes, it was on ""Live Bullet"" and was better there, but still... Why not put out the complete album as originally released and add a few bonus tracks to fill out a 2nd cd? Believe me, Bob's got enough fans that would buy it immediately--just look at the clamoring for his back catalog of classics to be released."
4,A missed opportunity,"This album is one of about ten that shaped my early adult life. I was an 18-year-old student when it was released. and it still burns in my soul, nearly a quarter of a century on. I can almost track the fate of my first great love through the songs. ""You'll Accompany Me"", ""We've Got Tonight"", ""Night Moves"", and, of course, ""Fire Down Below"". The only track missing from that particular allusion is ""The Famous Final Scene"".Like other reviewers, I think this album is crying out for a remaster than restores its original running time in full, and presents the full glory of Chuck Berry's ""Let It Rock"", even if it means switching to a 2-disc format. Look what they did with Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""One More From The Road"", last year?! The whole thing remastered onto two CDs, using the original 2-inch tapes as the source.Come on, guys! What's stopping ya?!"
5,Bob Seger's Greatest Album of the Century,"This album is by far one of the best albums ever concocted by someone in my generation...Bob Seger's as classic as they come, I'd recommend this album to my children, grandchildren etc...It's good to see him back in performance live mode, and hopefully this tour won't be his last...Brando Quin, author of ""The Master Painter"""
5,Another Great Bob Seger Live Album,"NINE TONIGHT is another great live record by Bob Seger. It's not as great as LIVE BULLET, but it contains some tracks from NIGHT MOVES and STRANGER IN TOWN, which makes it quite excellent. Granted, ""Tryin' To Live My Life Without You"" is not a great expression of artistic freedom, but the title cut (from URBAN COWBOY) is. Most of the other songs are great, and this would be Seger's sixth great album in a row."
5,great album.,"because you will know every song on it. those are the ones you want for the car stereo when the radio doesn't ""cut"" it anymore."
5,Long Time Listener to this album,"It's curious really but I hated this album when I first heard it. My mate Paul and I were lifeguards and he played it non-stop on tape. I really hated it. Later I went to London and a couple of years into my stay I felt a bit homesick so I went and purchased an import CD copy - UKP22! I loved it. It was wild. The upbeat got you going and everyone listend at the slowish tracks (Against the Wind etc). My apartment got burgled a few months later and all my CD's got stolen - not very pleasant, I can assure you. The first CD I went and purchased was this one. I just couldn't get enough. I have to say that almost everyone who I have played the CD for has bought a copy. In my opinion, things don't get any better!"
4,needs re-mastering!!!,"I am in the minority thinking that this was a better live LP than ""live bullet"" Captures Bob as he was!!! Please re-master!!!"
5,This is a great live album!,"I bought this on LP when it first came out and it immediately became my favorite live album. So many live albums lose the balance between the music and the audience, where the music overpowers the crowd to the point where you lose the thrill of the event being ""live."" ""Nine Tonight"" carries the perfect balance here, as well as providing a nice collection of great rock songs, like ""Against The Wind,"" ""Night Moves,"" and ""Rock And Roll Never Forgets."" My only complaint about this CD is the need to shorten the final song, ""Let It Rock,"" to fit it onto one CD. That song highlighted Seger's rapport with the audience, and the abridged version is not as good as the original. Other than that, I highly recommend this CD to all Seger, and rock and roll, fans!"
1,Let It Rock (Medley) (Live),"Would have bought if ""Let it Rock"" was restored to it's original length. That was the only reason I was looking forward to the remastered CD."
1,Live Music,"I'm afraid that I didn't pay attention when I selected this album for my wish list. The price was right, but I don't like ""live"" music. Too much interference with the songs! If, I want the concert experience, I will go to the concert. Mr. Seager puts on a great show, but I'd rather hear his songs from a studio now. That way you can hear every nuance of the voice. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure many people feel differently. Thanks."
3,I had to replace my night tonight album.,"This is old school, Bob Seger live. I still have the album. But my turntable is ""dust in the wind"". The remix sounds good. And now rocks with my iPod."
1,Motorola Slim Battery is useless!,Motorola Slim Battery is useless! I would not recommend it to anyone. It did not increase the power holding capacity as I expected.
4,Motorola Slim Battery,This battery seems to be working good. I don't use my cell phone that much but I haven't had to charge the battery since I first got it. So I know it's doing it's job.
3,Motorola Slim Cell Phone Battery,"My old battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore so I tried this. It was better than buying a new phone but although it is the same battery, it doesn't seem to hold a charge for as long as the one that originally came with the phone."
3,Good not great,"When I purchased this grinder it was $41.99 now it is selling for nearly half that. For the current price it is a fair deal. It is slightly above the Harbor Freight and other ChiCom batch of cheapo grinders but miles from Milwaukee, Metabo and other top shelf tools. This one has been abused more than used and is still functioning as it did when I opened the box. The bearings are still quiet and if it lasts another year before dying I will be happy with the purchase.Still, I could have bought 3 of the HF units for what this one cost and it isn't 3 times as good."
1,Worst travel book I have ever purchased,This book looks great but is actually just a listing of hotels and wineries that belong to a trade association. I looked for the names of 10 wineries and 5 top restaurants that my wine merchant told me to visit. Not one of them is listed. The ones that are listed are very small and most of them don't even export their wines to the US. No thanks!!
3,Poor Collection,"sorry but this not a good record !the songs are cut short, intros are missing completely ... ?you are way better off buying both Fly like an Eagle and Book of Dreams and if you want, The Joker ... that was you will all of this and SO MUCH MORE !!!great artist ... great music ... poor collection !"
5,great cd,"THe Steve Miller band really shows its talents on this cd, it has a good beat, and is fun to work with , it keeps you movated."
3,CD purchase,"I only give 3 stars because of the following reasons...The Jewel case was broken, probably due to shipping it with another on (they were both broken) CD seems to play correctly."
1,"Nothing ""Great"" about it......","How a group with limited musical talent and laughable lyric writing ability ever acheived the amount of success the Steve Miller Band did is truly a great unsolved mystery. If you haven't been exposed to this band and have an IQ above 100, stay away at all costs...."
4,STEVE MILLER BAND- GREATEST HITS 1974-1978,A classic piece of music. Great to listen to after all these years.Brings you back in time.
5,This ain't no joke,Steve Miller Band is one of the greatest bands of all time and this album proves it. From Swingtime to Wild Mountain Honey you'll be listening to this cd for many many hours. Buy this while it's still here!
5,The best!,This is one of the best Greatest Hits collection ever gathered in one album (probably second only to .38 Special's Flashback). It really captures the spirit of Miller's music during the second (and better) half of the 70's. It's just a must have for the true rock fan.
1,no,"this album is a no. so are all steve miller's. miller is a crooning idiot who thinks he is so cute. his voice is one of the worst i have heard in years (on Jet Airliner he sounds like he is saying ""Bingo Gyp with a lineup"" instead of ""big ol jet airliner""), and the music is overrated and outdated. most of his songs are annoying and/or awful. stay away."
1,what?,"How come they edited the first opening riff on Jet Airliner, Ireally like that alot. I dont know, I dont like this band andtheres only 3 good songs. Take the Money and Run, Rock N Me, JetAirliner, too bad they eddited that. Buy book of dreams and waste your amount of money on it and listen to the Jet Airlineron it, it's much better. The Joker is one of the worst songs Ihave ever heard in my lifetime. That's what makes this compilation sucks the price!! LISTEN to the Dire Straits insted.""Telegraph Road""""Heavy Fuel""""Money for Nothing""""Skateaway""""Sultans of Swing""""So Far Away""""Walk of Life""""Industrial Disease""""Calling Elvis""""Romeo and Juliet""""Down to the Waterline""""Solid Rock""""Private Investigations""""Expresso Love""""Brothers in Arms"""
5,Steve Miller Band,I had this CD before and unfortunately got ill with brain cancer and I needed to hear this and it could no be found. So now I am enjoying this CD once again and it will never get lost again.
3,A Less-than Great Greatest Hits Collection,"While Steve Miller fanatics may cheer the ""artistic scope"" of his second greatest hits collection, the casual fan(the type who would rather buy such a collection than assemble all of the old 8-tracks) is left to fast forward. A single omnibus collection of Miller's highest-charting singles would be appreciated by just such a fan. While worth the purchase price, a truly great album is worth that and so much more. Three stars for having ""Take the Money and Run"", ""Jet Airliner"", and ""Fly Like an Eagle"" in one place."
4,"Good quality, Steve Miller is very talented","I remember Jet Airliner when one word was controversial at the time and radio stations played a modified version. Unfortunately, this album contains that modified version instead of the original that's on my vinyl LP. It doesn't make a difference as to the quality or talent of the man but it is the reason I downgraded it by one star. The word? Rhymes with spit. Picky, I know, but it's the principle. :-) (George Carlin was right!)"
2,Misleading Title Tells Half the Story,"Considering Miller's staying power, especially with his concert-going audience, one has to wonder why this CD has achieved legendary status. It's true that there are seven U.S. top 30 hits here, but the remaining cuts never even charted. While these non-charting tracks may be well-known to the Miller devotee, they are curiosities to the casual fan (including myself), who would probably want a definitve, single-disc collection that encompasses all of Miller's big hits from the pop and album rock charts. And most diehard fans already have the albums from which the cuts on this CD are taken. Also, if you want full album versions of your favorite Miller songs, you may not find them all here, as some have been edited. Like Bob Seger's ""Greatest Hits"" CD, this album needs to be replaced by a more complete and definitive collection worthy of the artist."
5,Steve Miller at his finest!,"All Steve Miller fans will love this one;afterall they are his ""Greatest Hits""! Takes you back to the day quite nicely!"
3,"Seven Hit Singles, Two Lesser Hits Not Included","I'll leave it to other reviewers to comment on editing.I look for a ""best of"" CD to include the hit singles on the Billboard 100. This CD includes seven, but omits two, albeit lesser, hits in the 1974-8 time frame. They are: ""Living in the USA"" (peaked at #49 in 1974) and ""Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But Trash"" (#51 - 1974).I don't understand why the time frame couldn't have been 1970-8 which would have caught ""Going to the Country"" (#69 - 1970).Apparently other tunes were thought to be better to include. There are six, and they are well done, but ""Dance, Dance, Dance"" seemed out of place with the other tracks."
1,Where's the Rest of the album?,"Sure, it may have their greatest hits, but they aren't the full versions, most of them are shortened, including Jet Airliner, fly like an eagle, the joker, and others. You're better off buying the original albums, Book of dreams, Fly like an eagle, and The Joker."
3,Not the best recordings...,"You love Steve Miller, your vinyl is wore out. Why not get the greatest hits on CD? They put the old radio cuts on this release. ""Take the Money and Run"" is shortened. And ""Jet Airliner"" is censored. Did the producers think we wouldn't notice?"
5,first classic rock CD I ever owned,I think this CD is great i mean I like every song on it. Its the CD that got me listening to classic rock. It has all the bands great hits on it and I don't care if it doesn't have space cowboy on it because i dont like that song is even that good. before i listened to this CD i was into rap and I thought that classic rock was only for old people. going from rap to classic rock is a big change and if this CD can do it then you know it is good
3,I Got Gypped,"From now on I'm going deeper into customer reviews. Had I read the review from the person who warned that this CD has the shortened and censored version of ""Jet Airliner"" I never would have made this purchase. When I discovered the unhappy truth while driving in my car, I wanted to ""fly"" this CD like an eagle -- or make that a frisbee -- right through the moonroof."
4,"Yes, but",What everybody's been saying about Steve Miller's music in the 70's is true: classic pop songs that really typify the era.My one complaint is (Amazon? Are you listening): Why does the mp3 download have the radio edit of Fly Like an Eagle instead of full 6 minute version?
1,Buyer Beware: Only buy it at the Used Prices,"From the reviews and the illustration, one expects the book format to be spectacular. However as priced new at $140 - $180 dollars, the type media is not supported by it's new price. Enjoy all of the comments above at a $45 - $65 range new, anything paid above that range will result in severe disappointment when the end product is received."
4,RICH,"The most outstanding track on this recording is ""Happy Valley"" with the next tracks being ""Retro"", ""I'm a Doun"", ""Embrasse Moi"", and ""Storm"". ""Happy Valley"" has a rich chorus celebrating China. It is a loud track, layered greatly and almost traditional, the orchestra is great. ""Embrasse Moi"" has Vanessa singing French and English lyrics, it is an infectious song, a rock and pop piece. STORM is so much greater than THE VIOLIN PLAYER, better produced, better compositions, everything is much more solid."
3,Pretty good,"I love what she did to Vivaldi's four seasons. The whole cd is great to listen to, but I did not expect there to be words other than that its great."
5,truly a 'best buy',"this is one of her best albums yet, even great compared to her newest cd 'subject to change'. the main theme 'storm' is not a hyperbole. with tracks composed by her, you know this is the best of classical-techno music on the market"
4,Gorgeous Griselda,"I'm a newcomer to baroque opera and vivaldi. I now own five of his operas with Griselda being the latest. I must say I absolutely love this opera. Lemieux, Cangemi and Jarousky are superb. The coloratura is to die for and the orchestral playing is first class. Very exciting. I'm very passionate about singing, being a tenor myself and mainly singing the Mozart, Puccini, Donezetti, Verdi repertoire which is full of drama, but this is some fierce stuff. Its so refreshing to hear a tenor in this recording apart from all the ""high"" voices which could be a little texturally monotinous, and tenor Stephano Ferrari does a wonderful job with this demanding score. The act II trio is sublime and all the arias belonging to Cangemi and Kermes is total ""madness"" which I love. I would love it if Naive issue a dvd with their recording giving us a taste of these fine musicians working hard in the studio, at these operas for our enjoyment. [...]"
5,Quick and easy,As with most of the purchases I have with Amazon.com this shipped quickly and was exactly as described.Service is the highest quality.Thank you.
4,2011 remaster,"i bought this hoping to find some improvement, or change to the sound of this album. It doesn't seem very different to to me than the earlier version I have of it. I think there's more bass, which this album didn't really need. So if you're sitting on the fence as to whether you should buy this remaster, I'd say save your money, because there isn't much of an increase in sound quality."
5,My favorite of pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd,"This album is great to those of us who like a little of everything in our music. The title track is a good combination of classical and rock. At the time of this recording there weren't too many groups doing arrangements like this. It is simple but very pleasing to any hardcore fan of The Floyd. Track 2 - ""If"" is a good example of Roger Water's music to this date. Although it's not one of my favorites, it's still worth listening to. Track 3 - ""Summer of '68"" is a really good upbeat melody. Very nice piano work and lyrics. Track 4 - ""Fat Old Sun"" is my secon favorite of the album. Although the album version is a little dull, it still has a nice feel to it. Just goes to show that David Gilmour can write good music. Track 5 - ""Alans Psychedelic Breakfast ...."" Is to me probably a little bit of a waste, but that's only my opinion.This album is worth a listen to. Try it, you'll like it."
3,An interesting experiment,"Many people will probably say that this album is too long and self-indulgent and in many respects, they are right. This album is not without its charms, however. I like the lush orchestration of the first track, even though the sheer length of the suite (and indeed the entire record)can get a bit tedious at times. It can be quite pretty!All in all, I bought this album to see if it was as musically dense and whimsical as I had been told - I was not disappointed.In short, you should probably buy this album if you want to hear what Pink Floyd can do when they have an entire orchestra at their disposal. If you want lean, uncomplicated rock music, buy something else!I think this is a nice effort, representative of an important phase of Pink Floyd's career. Listen to it and make up your own mind."
3,Methinks this one's been a tad over-rated!,"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not dispute that AHM contains lavish orchestrations, gentle vocals, or even the birth (perhaps . . . ) of ""prog rock"". What I DO dispute, however, are the gushing statements in which this is deemed ""Essential Floyd"". There are those who will disagree with me (endlessly bickering . . . . YAWN!), but I feel AHM is not fully realized nor brilliantly constructed - I respect it as a monumental EFFORT, but one which was not on target. In short, AHM puts me to sleep when I am not tired.I recommend ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", ""Ummagumma"", ""Meddle"", ""The Final Cut"" and ""Animals"" before AHM (DSOTM and ""The Wall"" are given), in that order. True, AHM represents a pivotal moment for a pivotal band, but I'd like to make clear to the uninitiated that there are better albums to hear before subjecting yourself to this. Pertinent in Floyd's development? Yes, that's why completists rave about this album. Great album? Uhhhh, no."
2,Recommended for Collectors Only,"There are those on this thread who find this album musically compelling, but this long-time Floydian isn't one of them. No disrespect intended. That being said, the 2011 remaster provides a richer and fuller sound that is well worth the purchase price... IF you liked this album in the first place. However, if you are unfamiliar with the material on this album, I highly recommend you spend a little time on the web, listen to each track all the way thru and know what you're buying before you plunk down your hard-earned cash. IMHO, this is the single weakest entry in the Floyd catalog. Two stars because Fat Old Sun is a cool tune."
5,"Massively overlooked, brilliant, focused, and NOT SLOPPY","This album has a marginal reputation at best, but don't be fooled! It is a beatiful, coherent composition that needs no drugs to be breathtaking. Every song is meticulous and thoughtful in both structure and instrumentation, and as Pink Floyd albums go, this is (for me) the absolute apex."
2,hmm.,"whilst not a great album when compared to what came after, Atom Heart Mother is a humouress album evoking a somewhat folky feel, where even the brass band feels welcome. It doesn't stand up to repeated listens, as it is perhaps a novely album, though Rick Wright's Summer '68 is the highlight here, and feels more like the Floyd we know. Fat Old Sun is another number which is pleasant, though hardly earth moving."
3,Nothing special,"This is the first album I ever bought in my life and listening to it now I can understand why I was attracted to this strange, adventurous music - in 1970. But alas, the Cow Album doesn't hold up very well after forty years. Sure, side one has its good moments, but without Ron Geesins participation it would have been a big bore. And as for the rest, well ... nice, but nothing special. If and Fat Old Sun just meander. And Alans breakfast is just not edible, save for part three which contains some strong keyboard playing by dear old Richard Wright. All in all, a few pieces of good meat and a lot of watery milk."
4,Floyd's Mushroom Album,"This is far from PF's best, but it is still a great album. I've heard that they were consuming a lot of magic mushrooms while recording this album and it shows. The best song is the Atom Heart Mother Suite, although it may be just too out there for some ears."
3,Searching for identity,"3 1/2Captures Floyd beginning to merge their psychedelic pathos with more constructed orchestrations, this splendid combination with next year's Meddle feels like a great double-disc (after all, many themes from the bloated Classical homage title track do reappear on the equally extended Echoes). Still, Beatles-channeling and all, Atom Heart is a worthy pre-DS addition."
4,4.5 stars - Transition album: highly experimental,"This album characterizes a highly experimental period of the Floyd, between their highly psychedelic early years and their more progressive works which were to come following this album, such as ""Dark Side of the Moon."" It's by no means an easy listening album, nor Floyd's most experimental either (Ummagumma has that title well earned, in my opinion): it has a very unique balance resulting from the crafty musical minds of Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason, the influence of Ron Geesin, fundamentally in the 24-minute epic suite that gives the album its title, and finally, the collaboration of Engineer Alan Parsons, who would break musical ground with the band later on with ""Dark Side..."""
3,Atom Heart Whatever,"I had known of Atom Heart Mother for 30 years & think I had heard it once. It is a non-significant & sometimes silly album that Pink Floyd released in 1970. The band had not left Barrett's influence completely (even though he had been out of the band for a few years already) with groovy, hippy-style songs like ""If"" & ""Summer '68"" reminiscent of Piper at the Gates of Dawn. These songs are woven in with experimental Psychedelic work that seems trite by today's standards. All in all, the band was working its way to Meddle, then Dark Side where they really discovered themselves.I wish there was another standard of rating other than 3/5 stars. It is certainly not required to own as far as classic albums go. It is very well recorded (the remastered version is impeccable) and there is no question of the musicianship, yet it does not fit in today's categories. I think we have out grown what it was tying to say."
5,another forgotten classic,"those raised on aor will just not get this album, prog rock fans will be in seventh heaven. much softer than umma gumma [floyds best] but great. space music at its best."
4,atom heart mother,"Atom Heart Mother brings a lot to the table. First of all it displays the awesome talent of all 4 bandmembers (something lacking in previous albums save Meddle). Second it shows how they can preform instrumental music as well as varying styles of lyrical music. It takes you from the mellow, smooth-sounding Fat Old Sun to the rough edged Summer 68. And the instrumental music sounds as if you were on an acid trip with the mood varying varieties of the atom heart mother suite. All and all this was the last of Floyds psychadelic experimentation albums and the best one since Piper at the Gates of Dawn."
1,What the Heck?,"What exactly was this supposed to be? I mean, the songs were all just dull, mostly instrumentals with no life to them. I know that Waters and Gilmore could have done better than this. I was sorely disappointed by this album. Yuk!"
1,PUUULLLEEEAAASSSEEEEE!,"I have to agree with Sean, the music here is bad, there is no entertainment value. Next thing you know, they'll be telling us YES makes good music!!!!!!!Avoid Floyd, especially this shameful album."
3,Glimpses of Brillance,"As a long time fan of Pink Floyd's music and finally coming to terms that there may never be another new Pink Floyd recording I decided to start checking out the portion of thier catalog that I had over looked for so many years. I started with 'Meddle' and decided to work back from there. I throughly enjoyed 'Meddle' and went to the next logical step 'Atom Heart Mother'. This one has been a mixed bag for me. I've listened to it multiple times with the hope that it will grow on me with each play. So far, I'm still waiting.The opening track & closing track have moments of brillance, but for every good moment there are moments that seem overindulgent & selfabsorbed. The remaining tracks: If (nice acoustic number), Summer of '68, & Fat Old Sun (both numbers are very Beatlesque)are much more easier for the listener to appreciate.All & all this is a good album, certainly worthy even for the casual Pink Floyd fan."
5,Pink Floyd is an invention of music all their own.,All who listen to Pink FLoyd should immediately know how great they are. no other band has ever come close to duplicating their work.
3,The AHM Sandwich Is Great Filling With Lousy Bread.,Hippies must LOVE the title track and roadie Allan's breakfast antics. Certianly this track is inventive and original. But from a musical standpoint it's pathetic.However if you look at the filling on this sarnie you find:If - Simple and catchy one of Roger's best pre-dark side offerings.Fat Old Sun - Awesome track written by Gilmour as a follow up to Grandchester Meadows. The distortion on the guitar is what makes this song.Summer '68 - Next to Paintbox this is Rick's finest hour. A genuinely catchy tune with an original idea of the chorus being Dave's distorted voice.This album is worth having beacuse the 3 middle tracks are just so good (especially Summer'68). However the opener and ender are just Wayyyyyyyy too trippy for me.
3,Atom Heart Is A Curious Affair,"Probably one of the most peculiar entries in the Pink Floyd catalog, Atom Heart is recommended for anyone who liked ""Meddle"" or ""Obscured By Clouds"". The title suite, although interesting at times, is really the precursor to more fully developed ideas like ""Echoes"" (from ""Meddle"") and ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" (from ""Wish You Were Here""). It plods along unpredictably and is quite tedious in spots. Roger Waters' ""If"" is a beautiful song that is as introspective as anything he's ever written. Richard Wright's contribution, ""Summer '68"" is a brilliant, hard- rocking piece and Gimour's ""Fat Old Sun"" is comparable to ""A Pillow Of Winds"" in it's melancholy, acoustic performance. The experimental ""Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast"" is fun to listen to, but is an average effort at best."
3,"""Hmmm...Me Flakes...""","Wow-This album is a trip. It seems like an entire instrumental but quickly changes around from funk to psychedelic and back again. This was just the tip of the ice-berg for what was to come later from Pink Floyd. 1970 was a new decade and Floyd fully embraces the new ways (at that time)to fool around with sound and rythyms.What really is a standout on this album is 'Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast' whichfollows this bloke around his kitchen as he fries eggs, bacon, pours coffee, slurps it down,etc. It's as if they stuck a mic into the cereal bowl itself to trip you out as you listen. Very interesting stuff. A must have for the Floyd fan."
5,Another good album,"one of the best instrumentals albums from pink floyd other than meddle whcih had echos.This album sounds progressive an a little bit psychedelic an if your aware of the Ozric Tentacles band? This album right here sounds a little like Ozric Tentacles.Only album's that i dislike from pink floyd is the final cut, an the divison bell whcih their nothing specail."
3,Definitely not their best,"I'm as big of a Pink Floyd fan as anyone that gave this album 5 stars, it's just that there isn't much good stuff here. For example, the opening 23 minute title track is very uninteresting and poorly put together, and fails to keep my attention. If you want a flawless 23 minute Floyd track, you must check out ""Echoes"" from their Meddle album.There is SOME decent stuff here, though. ""Summer 68"" is a nice, Beatles-esque piano-based number. ""If"" is another gem. But don't get me started on ""Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast"". 13 minutes of a man eating bran flakes is not my idea of music. Don't get me wrong, though, Floyd were well on their way to being an amazing band. A year or two later they would release their great Meddle album and just 3 years later, the perfect Dark Side of the Moon. This one just isn't that rekmarkable. That's not to say it isn't an okay buy for the avid Floyd fan, however."
4,Post-psychedelia Floyd,"The 1970 Pink Floyd production ""Atom heart mother"" found the band sitting on a fence between their old psych-space rock and the future symphonic years, the great Hipgnosis sleeve and certain erratic moments mark the album, though the suite (Atom heart mother), ""Summer '68"" and ""Fat old sun"" are classic old Floyd, and make the album worthy.Meddle"
3,Atom Heart Mother,Atom Heart Mother being Pink Floyd 1970 release is an alright experimental rock album that is almost too experimental for its own good. It starts out with the odd 24 minute Atom Heart Mother that sounds more like a rock gig rather then a track and ends with the 12 minute long Alans Psychadelic Breakfast. I can honestly say that I like it but I am quite confused about this album as it seems a bit unfocused and confounding. The booklet is also a strange one with pictures of cows on the cover and inside the booklet. 3/5.
3,Not bad,"The first Pink Floyd I ever heard was ""Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,"" the last track on this album. It was 1971, and with certain illicit substances and headphones, need I say more? I was hooked. But I can also understand why some are ungrokked by this album. The title piece meanders all over the place, even though there are some cool moments within it. David Gilmour's ""Fat Old Sun"" is Ray Davies with an overdose of the cutes, ""If"" by Roger Waters is super-gloomy and stodgy, even by his standards, and only ""1968"" by Richard Wright really works as a ""song"" song. But ""Alan"" continues to this day to be fun to listen to, so I'm glad I have my CD copy. Just wouldn't play it as often as PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN----or WISH YOU WERE HERE, for that matter."
5,"Pink floyd's best album, Musics best album!","Like the title said i belive this is the best album ever made.. its godes.. i refuse to belive that any human can astimelate a so powerfull felling movment inside of me, without even know me.. any last one of you readers must bye it, & the sooner the better .. p.s sorry about my spelling..."
1,this has an average of 4 and a half?,"Don't buy this album even if somebody offers you 1 million dollars to do it. First the title track ""Atom Heart Mother"" starts of really cool, until the keyboard solo. If you bought Ummagumma that's bad enough,but never ever buy this. ""If"" is a long,effortless, dreary,boring song. ""Summer 68'"", might be the closest to half way, to a good song.""Fat Old Sun "" sounds petty much the same, except worse. Then we come to ""Alan's Stupid Breakfast"",. It's a 10 minute piece,of hearing 3 guys eat breakest,(or something). Then there are boring piano solo's,(yada,yada,yada).The first as well as last track,are drawn out dumb songs that make me feel like using the cd as a frisbe.DONT BUY THIS ALBUM. I REAPEAT,DONT BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,Bloated and boring,"Atom Heart Mother is a lot like Meddle, with one long ""composition"" on one side (of the original LP) and a handful of lame ""songs"" on the other side. Meddle is at least interesting. AHM is just awful, disorganized and aimless. The songs are totally forgettable. The side-long title track was orchestrated and constructed by Ron Geesin, so think again before you go pronouncing Atom Heart Mother the ultimate Pink Floyd album. It's a good thing an LP side only holds 20-30 minutes of music; who knows how much longer ""Atom Heart Mother"" (the suite) would have been if made in the digital/CD era. The band disavowed the whole thing about 2 seconds after they finished it. The album cover is wonderful, though. For completists only."
5,Undoubtedly one of Floyd'sbest and most underated albums,"Atom heart mother is a fantastical mixture of good melodies (fat old son), great lyrics (if) and psychedelia (...psychedelic breakfast, atom heart mother. It also features one of wrigh'ts best songs in summer of '68. Therefore, this album encompasses an eclectic mix of every pink floyd post-barret artistt, and does it in style. HOWEVER, IF THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH THE TITLE TRACK ATOM HEART MOTHER IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE SONG (AND I OWN ALL OF FLOYD'S AND INDIVIDUAL SOLO RECORDINGS . WITHOUT A DOUBT THE TITLE TRACK IS THE SINGLE-MOST UNDERRATED SONG IN THE FLOYD ARSENAL AND A GIGANTIC MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO APPRECIATES GREAT MUSIC. MOLTE BENE!"
5,best floyd ever,"best floyd ever...atom heart mother, alan's psychadelic breakfast, and of course my favorite, fat old sun...just a great all-around alblum, a testament to floyd's multifactedness (if thats even a word). And by the way, if you think any of this alblum sounds like the beatles, keep this in mind: this alblum was recorded at abbey road while the beatles were recording an alblum (possibly abbey road, but im not sure)"
5,I have NEVER cried over a book...,"I have never cried about a book, although I have read many heart wrenching tales, but this one brought tears to my eyes. Jenny loves Chance so much that, when he leaves without an explaination to confront his past hoping to regain his memory, she goes a little crazy. Chance is her rock and has been since they met when she was 11 years old. Through out her childhood and into adulthood her love for Chance grew into something beautiful to observe. When Chance leaves, Jenny is devastated.I have read many of Ms. Sala's books, and the only one on par with ""Chance McCall"" is the book ""Jackson Rule"" - which I highly recomend. In any case, if you are a fan of Ms. Sala you will not be disappointed by ""Chance McCall""."
4,Chance McCall,I'm a huge fan of Sharon Sala/Dinah McCall and was very happy to receive this book in such a timely manner. The condition of the book that was offered was in pretty good condition
2,good premise but DRAGGED,"Neglected daughter of rancher has been in love with ranch's foreman since she was young but he doesn't want to commit to her b/c of the secrets of his past. When he gets amnesia, he goes back to his hometown to figure out what's kept him from committing to very-willing heroine.This Sala book had a good premise & promising romance & sexual chemisty but it dragged on & on. This book would've been better if shortened by 100 pages. It didn't help that the female characters of the book were emotionally weak. They either committed suicide, attempted it, or thought about it as result of a crisis. The heroine also cried a lot. It became very annoying, reading about these pathetic female characters. Hero & his amnesia story redeemed this book.Only partially recommended. A better Sala book is ""Remember Me""."
4,A Great Beach Read,this was the first novel of this author's that I had read. Didn't involve much brain power but the characters kept me interested and since I've read more of her novels. Anyone can figure out the ending but at least the getting there is fun.
1,This is like a copied from Up-all-night version,"This movie is DEFINITELY not the one you want. It's been completely edited out and watered down. It's a sham that they dare to put the ""R"" label on this movie when it's been edited down to something tamer than you see on NBC or CBS. Could potentially even be considered fraud to advertise this as an ""R"" version."
1,Not this one.,"This is the version you do not want. There is another versionout there which is the one you want, but this one isn't it . Take my word for it."
3,Bikini Drive-in,"On May 24th , 2012----I bought the movie ( Bikini Drive-in ) I played it and the DVD was kind of messed up, what I mean is that in the middle of movie was kind a , other words, the Picture was fuzzy like it was a bad copie,I want to know if I send it back, will you please send me another one in Exchange.-----the Order # 104-0117670-2260203---that was the shipping confirmation #.purchase # 104-6453623-1677033 ( sold By Thrifty joes)which was Order #2: aokmovies2.Please get back to me over my email Address(shorty51947us@yahoo.com)Thanks alot and have a great evening Bye ---Ronald D. Brown"
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this. It is badly cut (i.e. sections of the original movie are missing), very low quality video, and the picture only takes up about 50% of the screen window (which is probably good, blown up to full screen it would probably be un-watchable). The ""product details"" on the website are misleading in that it infers that you are getting a DVD disk. What you actually get is a ""DVD Movie"", i.e. playable only on a computer or similar device. It WILL NOT play on your standard home DVD player. I feel like returning it and asking for my money back!If you want a copy of this movie I suggest you try to find an old ex-rental copy on VHS video - it might not be great after all this time, but would have to be better that this! I have given it one star, as Amazon wont let me put zero which is what it deserves.Please Amazon, don't peddle rubbish like this, you will ruin your reputation as a supplier!"
2,Too Noisy,"Quality is fine, but noise was not. I was trying to use it to drive the ventilation in my ASUS Sabretooth motherboard Thermal Armor, but just way too noisy. I'll keep looking for another one..."
4,Bought as a replacement fan for my Biocube14g.,"Great purchase!Pros:-It's quite powerful for a cheap priced fan.-You can buy multiples since its priced cheap.Cons:-Its not silent(although its better than the rattling sound I hear from other cheap fans).-Wish it came with screws.Nevertheless, if your looking for a cheap replacement 50mm fan this is a good buy!"
1,NOT happy at all,I bought two of these fans to replace stock fans in my light hood for a fish tank. One of the two fans is still working but the other died within a week. They were cheap so I figured I'd buy another and it must have just been a bum. I put the new one in and after a day that one has now died too!!! I'm really aggravated.
5,"This fan blows! But that's good, right?",Not much I can say about this except that it does a great job of moving air and keeping the components on my Sabertooth P67 motherboard nice and cool.
2,Swallowed by big-a#% plot hole,"All I have to say about this is, if you were a group of four menaced by a group of two in a cabin, don't you think you would stay and beat the snot out of them rather than panic and run into the dark woods? The story CANNOT get over this huge black hole of a plot crater, as far as I'm concerned, and as it is slow enough before it gets to that point, the OK performances, OK script and OK horrors aren't enough to make you forget it."
2,Drive right by Sam's Lake..,"Sam's Lake is a real snore fest. Not gore fest, snore fest. I can appreciate the director trying to build atmospheric tension. In fact, I enjoy a slow buildup and chilling foreboding atmosphere in my horror movies. However, he doesn't have the actors to pull it off. So what we are left with is a bunch of horrible actors smiling awkwardly at each other and lot of uncomfortable silence. Then finally, and mercifully the predictable and violent end occurs. And not a moment to soon."
1,DO NOT WATCH,"this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. it had the potential to be a good movie, but it just SUCKED. it was plain awful and i'm sad i wasted an hour and half of my life watching it."
4,A must-see!,"This movie starts out a little slowly, but the suspense builds nicely and the twist is worth waiting for. I'm not easily scared, but I watched this movie clutching my blanket and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. If you want a scary film with an interesting plot and just enough gore, this one won't disappoint! Not to be missed by true horror fans!"
3,Good,Good style of writing and very enjoyable . No major surprises. Start to seem very samey after a while and can get boring. Only read one or two by this author at a time.
4,Another Hit,"Coben cranks out the hits through stand alone novels and the Bolitar series. Here is another and he does not disappoint on any level. Ny now we know the main characters, and they continue to show more depth for the reader. The plot? Full of twists and turns as we've come to expect, and even when we start to figure out where all the pieces fit, the book is nearly complete - but Coben still has a few important steps to take before he ties it all up. Can't wait to read #7 in the series."
2,Point of View,"I bought the book because a review I read of it compared Mr. Coben to Raymond Chandler. I think that probably Mr. Coben is trying to write like Raymond Chandler, and maybe he does later in the book. I put it down after only 26 pages, however, and don't plan to take it up again because of the lack of a consistent point of view. Mr. Coben jumps from one character's point of view to another, then to omniscient point of view, then to authorial p.o.v. The thing that decided me not to finish the book, however, was when he switched point of view within a sentence.I was sad not to finish the book because I think Mr. Coben has a fine feel for keeping tension alive, but I was just to distracted by the p.o.v. issue."
4,Nice Continuation of the Series,"First of all, I strongly suggest reading the Myron Bolitar series in order.I like Coben's stand-alone books better than the Myron Bolitar series, and I think the Bolitar series is very good - they appear to be more of Coben's alter ego with the wisecracks, who really drinks Yoo-Hoo, the former female wrestlers, etc. This book is what we have come to expect from Harlan Coben - a mystery that wrenches in your guts, the good guys unfortunately dies, and just when you think you have the whole thing figured out he cuts a hard left that rolls you over into a new direction. Coben is one of those authors who snares you pretty fast and has you thinking about the book even while you're not reading it."
3,A mix of intrique and humor,"Coben weaves his story around the concept that eventually your past wrong doings catch up with you. A fatal drunk driving accident destroyed many lives not the least of which, the young girl who was killed.Myron, a sport's personnel agent, finds himself in the middle of an investigation of the death of one of his clients. Finding his business partner jailed and accused of the client's murder, Myron throws himself into finding evidence in order to clear his partner.Coben's clever way of introducing humor into the story adds much and makes for an enjoyable read."
4,Good read,I enjoy the series and this did not disappoint. I am amazed at how often Myron gets abused (beaten up) and goes on to another day. Love the parts about his relationship to his parents and his work colleagues.
5,Harlan Coben contains to entertain.,Harlan Coben has done it again. I keep expecting the series to get old and predictable but this last edition maintains the high standards that he has set in his other books. It is just a very enjoyable read. What more can you ask except that another one show up in a year if not sooner.
4,Entertaining and Funny,"I enjoy this story but honestly it was the characters that really caught my interest. It's filled with funny one-liners and enough tv and movie references to make any entertainment buff go back to memory lane. There were several references to past stories in the series, but the story itself is self-contained. A solid mystery with plenty twists.Lost HoursFriday HouseXiii"
5,Great Read,He keeps you interested from the first page to the last withhumor and a good plot. Have read many of his books andHave not been disappointed. Looking forward to anotherOne of his books.
3,Kindle Version of this Novel,"While I enjoy Harlan Corbin's characters and story lines, the Kindle version I read had a substantial number of typos. They were so bad at times that I could only guess at what the author was trying to write. I don't know how the printed version is translated to the Kindle version, but in the case of this novel, quality control was sorely lacking.Were it not for these typos, I would have given the novel a 5-star rating."
4,Good book,Enjoyed this novel. The plot was excellent. He uses his characters well and keeps you guessing. Can not wait for his next novel.
3,Not the Finest Bolitar Novel,"I enjoy Harlan Coben's novels. Whether they be Myron Bolitar or one not in the series.Being an earlier novel, I suppose the characters were still evolving. I found Myron to be a bit over the top for a sports agent in this book. His sidekick, Win on the other hand, has evolved nicely so far. He provides a good foil for Myron.I just couldn't get into the story for some reason. Much of it seemed trite & not able to come together.I did enjoy the end. I think Mr. Coben thought the ending out very well & tied the loose ends of the story together. The ending is quite a surprise that the reader will not suspect"
3,Enjoyable,"I liked this much more than The Darkest Fear, and wonder if there is a disadvantage in reading the series backwards. Maybe I should have begun the Coben series from the first book instead of the last."
2,book is great..needs spellcheck,"Does Kindle have editors......or spellcheck? I have never read a book with so many misspelled words, unintellegible words spelled using symbols in place of letters, and words separated by a ""dash"" in the middle of a line of text. This book has errors on at least one in every five pages. Very disappointing."
5,If you have IBD you need this book.,"It used to be that this was the only 'laypersons' book out there for people suffering from IBD. Newly diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 10 years ago, I found this book to be enlightening and informative. It helped me to get a handle on things when I felt my life spiraling out of control due to a disease I had never even heard of before. Today those suffering from ulcerative colitis and Chrohn's Disease have more reading material at their disposal, but this book remains as the staple for any person suffering from IBD. It can also serve as an invaluable resource to friends and family of IBD survivors who also feel confused and helpless. Anyone who has ever taken prednisone for IBD knows the symptoms and treatments for these diseases can make articulate and unemotional explanations almost impossible to formulate. Handing over a copy of this to your siblings, parents, spouse, or even your roommate is the best thing you can do for them, and for yourself."
3,"Good overview, if a bit outdated","This is a very good general introduction to the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis, for the family, friends, or patient that has been recently diagnosed with one of these diseases. It covers the details of the disease and also current treatment IBD (circa 1983). However, please understand that this book has not been updated since 1983. There have been many, many developments in the treatment of these diseases and the prognosis is much better than when this book was written. (They essentially only had Prednisone and Sulfasalizine for treatment at the time). They now have Remicade and other drugs used to treat IBD that are not addressed.Overall not a bad book, but you can probably find all of this information, plus information on newer developments, in some of the other books on IBD. Needless to say, if you buy this book, don't make it your only book on IBD."
5,Great information on Crohn's Disease,"As a Crohn's Disease patient, I used this book as a source for a research project. Although, currently there are more up-to-date sources, this book provided me with a vast amount of background information regarding the disease."
5,""" Creates a calming atmosphere .""","""Do You love Me"" wonderful sound tracks offers hopes and peace. It brings us to a place where we can meditate and plan our next move in life . The first time I heard this album , I felt so good,I cried . Thankyou Mr. Butler, for helping me feel good about myself. Quality musicians like yourselves are the hope to bring people together. Please continue to perform ."
4,Not what I expected,"I dont know whose fault it was, but when I received the CD, I did not get a complete CD I only received the title song ""Do You Love Me"". When I contacted the seller about the problem, they apolized and refunded me the entire amount and then told me that I did not have to return the CD. Now, that is what I call customer satisfaction."
5,One of his BEST!!,This is one of his BEST CDs. I lost my first copy and had a difficult time finding a replacement. A must have for any real Jonathan Butler fan.
5,THIS CD IS THE BOMB!!!!,"We heard Jonathan do some cuts from this CD at the Winter Park Jazz Fest in July 2000, and had to have it. I wake up listening to the CD. Try it if you really enjoy Smooth Jazz. You will like this CD."
5,FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP OF THE CHARTS....,"THAT IS HOW BRITNEY'S NEW SINGLE WILL GO. SHE HAS THE CHANGE FOR HITTING #1 ON THE BILLBAORD HOT 100 SINGLES.THE CRAZY REMIX IS GREAT, AND THIS IS BRITNEY'S BEST SINGLE YET.GO BRITNEY!"
2,From the Bottom of My Hurling Stomach,"This song is pretty bad. Britney should have gone the more lets say, not revolting route, and released Born To Make You Happy. Instead, she released this horrendous song which makes me kind of sick. It was ok for a while, but she can do so much better! C'mon Britney...not your best choice in singles!"
4,Awsome~!,This is a great single. The US version has only 2 tracks (From The Bottom of my Broken Heart and Crazy- Jazzy Jim's remix). This version contains @ bonus tracks as well (Thinkin' About You and Sometimes Answeing Machine Message.) The answering Machine message is kinda dumb but overall this is a grat CD. Definately worth the money!
1,SOOOO not worth it!,"I bought this single out of curiousity. Let me warn you: DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID! The lead track is absolutely TERRIBLE - Britney's voice is AWFUL and the song itself is almost as bad. The remix of ""Crazy"" IS NOT the one that was released to radio - it is an EXTREMELY BAD version of this already mediocre song. As for the Enhanced CD part, it couldn't possibly be any more boring. The video for the lead track shows Britney looking horrible and she just sits around and sings. VERY BORING. The CD doesn't even include the WHOLE video for ""Born To Make You Happy"", which is a really stupid boring video anyway. Whether you want to buy this for yourself, or you're a parent and your kid is nagging you to buys this, once word of advide: DO NOT BUY THIS! It's not even worth 1 cent, let alone 3 bucks! DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY THIS! IT'S BAD!"
4,Pretty Cool!,"It was good, but Britney has done better. This CD-Single includes the tracks:01. From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart02. ( You Drive Me ) Crazy""Crazy"" is really cool, it's some different version from the original, it's more: Hip-Hop ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"" is as slow as always, not my favorite, but ""Crazy"" rocks! Hope you enjoy it!"
4,"Good, for a single.","I bought this single after I had already purchased the entire cd. The reason? To check out the Crazy hip hop remix. The verdict? A good buy. If you are a great fan of Britney, then you will like these 2 songs, but its not a must have."
5,A cd couldn't be better,"This cd is just awesome! Everything you would ever want, is available on the cd - there's 2 tracks on it: ""From the bottom of my broken heart"", a shortened, edited version from the one that is one Britney's debut cd. Absolutely wonderful ballad. Track 2 is Jazzy Jim's hip hop remix of Crazy - so great - you'll keep playing it over and over, and it is so dance-able. Super! There's an enhanced part too - watch 1-minute long clips of Britney's ""Born to make you happy"" and ""From the bottom of my broken heart"" videos in DVD quality! It's just wow!! There's also an audio player so you can listen to the cd on the computer, and a photo gallery with 9 beautiful, high quality pics of Britney. And, there is a biography included, and as the final bonus, an announcement for Britney's ""upcoming album and home video"", which is old news, but kind of funny though.All I can say is WOW!! and this is definitely recommended to any fan of pop music. GO GET IT!!"
3,Pretty Good Song,In case you've read some of my other reviews you might learn that I don't like ballads much. This was a ballad but I actually liked it. A lot of people have seen the music video because it was shown a lot on Total Request Live. I like the music video. I like the chorus of this song the most. I'd buy this if you don't like Britney much and you just like this song but if otherwise buy ...Baby One More Time AND Oops!...I Did It Again because I have them and they are both really good.
5,USGA's revenge,"When Johnny Miller scorched the Oakmont course with a blistering 63 on the final day the USGA was embarassed, and humiliated. The next years tournament was at Winged Foot and the old boys at the USGA spent the winter making sure that Miller's feat would not be repeated. The course was made next to impossible and the scores skyrocketed. Although the USGA denied that they had tampered with the course it was evident to all that they had,QED. Dick Schaap has documented the travails of the best players in the world in an account that is instructive, informative and funny. If you are a golf fan this is a mandatory read. This year at Congressional Rory McElroy made the Open look like the Quad Cities. Wait until next year at Olympic you won't see another wrecking of par, the USGA will see to that."
5,An excellent 1980s and early '90s salsa sampler.,"This 2-CD set is a sampler of TH-Rodven Records' 1980s and'90s biggest hits and features the label's most popular artists (ironically, it was released just before the label folded in 1996). Oscar D'Leon, Tommy Olivencia, Paquito Guzman, Frankie Ruiz, Eddie Santiago, David Pabon and others are all here and the sound quality is excellent."
4,A Good CD,"I am not a huge Kenny Rogers fan, but he did some quality songs such as ""Coward Of The County"", ""Ruby Don't Take Your Love To Town"", ""Love Will Turn You Around"", ""We Got Tonight"" (Although Bob Seger's version is better), and of course ""The Gambler"". You get all the Rogers you will need except ""Islands In The Stream"". It is a worthwhile CD to have in your collection."
3,"Great Songs, Awful Sound","The songs on this cd are well written, well played, and well sang. The only problem with this ""CD"" is that it sounds like it was transfered straight from vinyl, there's a heavy hiss in almost every track, and the EQ is off, c'mon guys, re-master this disk!!! I'll buy it again!!"
5,I grew up on this stuff,"If you have ever heard Kenny Rogers than you know there is no substitute. This guy brings wholesome good country fun and love to his music. I can remember listening to this on eight track while on long drives when i was a kid. The songs still hold that no nonsense, fun loving country flavor. Kenny blows away any of his modern competition, this music weaves a story and is written from the soul! You'll find yourself tapping your foot and singing along to songs you know, even though you may not know you know them!"
5,Love Kenny!,"I read some reviews that said they got the wrong album or songs, but I had exactly the right album with the right songs. Love Kenny Rogers and this has most of his best....minus a few, but the best compilation Kenny Rogers album there is. Sound quality is fine to me...I downloaded it and put it on my iPod without any issues. Great album and a must for his fans!"
1,mistaken track listing,"I wish I could say I really loved this CD. But it's actually not what I expected. Probably this is due to the fact that I was misled by the listing appearing on the page. What I was sent was the album KENNY ROGERS - 20 GREAT HITS. It includes indeed 20 tracks, but I wouldn't call them 'Great Hits.' The tracks that appear on this CD are the following:1.Ruby, don't take your love to town; 2.Poem for my little lady; 3.For the good times; 4.Good lady of Toronto; 5.Where does Rosie go; 6.Me and Bobby McGee; 7.What am I gonna do; 8.All Go's lovely children; 9.Lay it down; 10.Tulsa turnaround; 11.Sunshine; 12.Goodtime liberator; 13.Reuben James; 14.Always leaving, always gone; 15.Elvira; 16.Shine on Ruby Mountain; 17.Loser; 18.Homemade Lie; 19.Ticket to Nowhere; 20.Ruby, don't take your love to town"
1,Totally disappointed,"I ordered this CD back in 2007 and none of the songs by Kenny Rogers listed on this CD case were even on it, they were all songs by Steve Miller instead along with the fact that the sound quality was poor too.Therefore, It was like a total waste of time and a rip off and you'd be better off getting it at a retail store like at a BEST BUY or a CIRCUIT CITY, since you can be more assured of what you're ordering there."
2,Hard to clean,"I purchased this baking sheet after recomendations from several sources. I did not find the surface to be very non-stick as advertised. In fact the instruction with the pan clearly indicated that they should be heavily greased in order to prevent food from sticking.The idea of having a cobbled surface, may make food cook evenly, but it makes cleaning a nightmare. All the cracks makes it impossible to get everything out.We returned the sheet, very disapointed."
1,Please do NOT buy from this company,"I bought the Doughmakers cookie sheets in a very nice store in my home town. After about a month of use, they develpoed a very nasty, sticky brown crust. I contacted the company by e-mail and received a very snarky, nasty reply. The reply only told me what I must have done wrong, only I had done nothting wrong in the care of the sheets. There was not an invitation from the company to discuss anything, just a dismissal that I must be quite stupid. Luckily, I was able to get the nice store to stop carrying the Doughmaker line, apparently there had been complaints before. Please do not buy from Doughmakers."
5,Possibly the best bake-ware ever,"I love doughmakers. I registered for all the types for our wedding, and we received most of it. My mom really wanted some after she saw mine, so I started her collection this Christmas. She loved this cookie sheet! Great quality, just don't put it in the dishwasher! My cakes have turned out much better. The design allows the cake to breath, so it doesn't stick and turns out perfect!"
5,Best Ever baking sheet,Over a year ago I decided to replace my old cookie sheets. I read many reviews and decided on 2 different manufacturers......bought one of each. I loved the Doughmaker sheet and wish I had ordered several. Now I ordered 2 from Amazon for my daughter-in-law as she cannot stand to use her Calphalon since they make cookies too dark on the bottom. Love the Doughmakers and will purchase more. Cookies and stromboli bake beautifully and easy to clean!
4,Pleased with pans,The pans came so quickly and they are just whet I was expecting. I love these pans. The size allows me to bake many cookies at one time. They are sturdy and easy to handle.
2,Disappointing,"I must agree with most of the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. I'm a huge Suzanne Brockmann fan and eagerly await each new installment. I feel that I really did not get my money's worth this time. I won't reiterate what others have said except to say that I agree that the story was too long and too easy to put down. However, I would like to add one point. I was seriously aggravated by all the almost teen-talking verbal vomit. Many times when the characters were considering a point, every digressing thought in their head was written in the paragraph. Eventually, I just began skipping ahead many sentences to avoid this inner verbal vomit."
4,Suzanne Brockmann is one of the best in the game,"Although Breaking Point was not the best book in her Troubleshooter series, this was a great read. I actually enjoyed the timeline jumps for the most part and felt that it was a different tact for Brockmann. Brockmann's characters are always interesting and vivid and the consistancy of their personalities is a definate asset. I continually look forward to more from Suzanne Brockmann and can't wait for the next book in the series."
2,"This is a ""Thriller""?",My first experience with a Brockmann book. I was expecting a well-written thriller and was disappointed to find instead a glorified Harlequin Romance. I won't bother with another of her books.
1,Turncoat author !!!,"Brockmann has made a fortune depicting heroic navy seals and generally setting her stories amongst the selfless acts of our military. In this book she reveals her true colors by weaving baseless, politically-motivated misrepresentations of the US military---no doubt based on ""facts"" from left-wing news sources that are disproved by only a little research. I personally am glad she showed her true colors so Americans can vote with their wallets."
3,"I love Max...and I love Gina, but...","There was something about this book that I didn't connect with emotionally. Max seemed...not Max-like, if that makes any sense. I was dying to see him and Gina connect, but when they did, it felt a bit flat and emotionless. Thus far, this is my least favorite of the Troubleshooter books."
1,Serious Breaking Point To Madness,"This book is actually the 9th book in Brockmann's Trouble Shooters series. When I started reading the book I had no idea that it was #9. Needless to say it was pretty easy to follow along. However, it was drawn out and I think it could have been done better.The story starts out like the movie ""Pulp Fiction."" It jumps from the present to the past to form one unique storyline. That was pretty cool but here are the flaws. The only part of this book that was decent was the characterization and the romance between Max and Gina, and even that leaves a lot to be desired, but it was the only redeeming quality of the book.For the rest of this review please follow this link:[..]"
5,"Awesome book, wonderful author!",I thoroughly enjoy reading Suzanne Brockmann and hope she continues to write the Troubleshooters series. I'm sad to end a book because I feel her characters become family.
1,Audio Review,"This is the second audio version of one of Suzanne Brockmann's books I've tried to listen to. But I can't get past the first couple minutes of listening to Patrick Lawlor---his voice is too high and over-dramatic for these alpha male stories, sort of like a teenager over-emphasizing everything.So I went back to reading instead. Another wonderful Brockmann story worth 4 stars."
1,Dopey love story masked as an FBI thriller,"Wow, this book was nothing like the back cover predicted. It certainly sounded like an FBI thriller, but it turned out to be a dopey love story instead. I'm not a big reader of the romance novel and now I know why.The main characters in this story spend more time thinking about and reflecting on their romanitic intrests than anything else. There's barely time to get the FBI action in.I would strongly recomend not to read this book unless you are looking for a sweet romantic love story between a completely pyschotic woman and a stuburn old FBI agent who really does not want to get involved."
2,Long Read,"I wish I didn't have this issue with not stopping something I have started, because I certainly would have stopped at the beginning. But, I hoped it got better. The constant joking/sarcasm was very distracting to the story. I kept waiting for the ""ba da bum"" drum roll after each sentence. Instead of trying to be so cute, the story should have been worked on a little more. I actually had to start skimming the ending, just to get through it. It took me over a month to read this( I usually read a book in a few short days), I had to force myself to pick it up. The ending I thought was a little rediculous. A couple about to die, playing house. The man who couldn't say two words about his feelings through the whole book, all of a sudden couldn't shut up. It was just a poor book."
3,What happened to Max?,"I had been so looking forward to Max and Gina's story, but this book was a disappointment. Hasn't Gina already been held hostage before? Why does Max act like an mewling idiot? And why does this ready-for-everything, always-perfectly-groomed guy live in a rathole apartment that has been burglarized so he's afraid for Gina to stay there? Considering his position at the FBI and everything else we knew about him, that seemed goofy. I enjoyed parts of this book, but the whining of both Max and Gina got very tiring. Sigh. I agree with other reviewers who didn't like Jules calling Max ""sweetie"", but I thought he was otherwise pretty darn good. And having Molly and Jones return was fabulous-loved them both!"
1,This need never have been a film,"It is difficult to hear the voice of Cobain on the soundtrack - it has been drowned by talentless video footage and an annoying soundtrack, often so invasive, that it defeats its purpose. This is a very unfortunate packaging of spoken word, soundtrack and video of appaling shallowness that never come together like the ingredients of a badly mixed cocktail. This material should have been released only as a spoken word recording, without any soundtrack whatsoever - let alone video. Having said that, Michael Azzerad could have been more discriminating in choosing a director for this oeuvre - almost anyone could have done a better job!"
2,A Little Disappointed,"I had very high hopes for this DVD, but it turned out to be a little boring. I lost interest very quickly."
2,Not Very Entertained,"This DVD was so bad. I got it thinking it was Kurt talking about his life and Nirvana, and it kind of was that. This DVD was so bad because they never showed any live Cobain or Nirvana music, and they never even showed Kurt's face when we was talking. It was just a bunch of dumb clips from where Kurt has been in the past. This is seriously a boring DVD, and no one should buy it.I do think it's cool how much Kurt talks about his life, but theres only his voice. Curt, Dave, and Christ aren't in this movie for a second."
2,Major Let Down!,"I am a hardcore Nirvana and Cobain fan. This movie was such a major let down. It seems like the company that produced this just grabbed some audio clips from Cobain interviews and shot some random footage of what I guess is supposed to be his hometown, but it could be any town they are just random clips. Nothing in this film fits together. It all just seems to be thrown in there. I am still a Nirvana fan. I gave this movie 2 stars just because it was about Cobain and nothing else."
1,Painful.,"The spoken words of Kurt Cobain would be GREAT to experience. Fortunately, this doc has them. Unfortunately, they are presented in such a farcical way as to make this film unwatchable.About A Son would have been fantastic if not for this film's absurd stylizing fantasies. Putting so much farce into the images, it forces a viewer into the mind-boggling conflict of wanting to stay, for the Cobain audio, yet repulsed by the distracting imagery competing with - no, mocking - the powerful heartfelt voice.Hopefully these interviews are available elsewhere, without the director trying to out-shine the real star. The words of Kurt Cobain are very powerful. Trying to give them even more power is just an insult, Schnack."
3,"Good,but not great.","A must have for the true Nirvana fan, but a little disappointing. I guess they could not use Nirvana music due to copywrite stuff, if the music was there it would have been great! Would I buy it again? Certainly, for I am a true fan!"
5,Just what the doctor ordered!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a must read book for diabetics. I have always felt that a low carb diet works best for diabetics. Dr. Bernstein also recommends exercise. This is a must read.
5,Excellent,Book is very insightful and interesting. I gives you better insight on eating habits as a diebetic. I brought it as a gift for my brother but started reading it and highlighting items in it. So I had to buy another one for my brother.
2,Can't feed my family this,"I agree with Dr. Bernstein's philosophy - I bought this book after reading Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution. It's just the recipes are very rich and bland, the kind my grandparents would have been happy with, but not what I want my kids to grow up eating. To me, these recipes typify the standard American diet, loaded with cream, butter and cheese. I'm not opposed to fat, but I'd rather have a recipe with coconut milk, or avocados-food with more nutritional benefit than a cup of cream. I bought this book to help me plan healthy meals, but I didn't find any inspiration here. I don't mean to denigrate the recipes, which are very elegant and are the kind of food I grew up with, it's just that I have plenty of recipes for roast chicken already. Had I seen the book beforehand I would have put it back."
2,Looks hard to live with,"I am sure that if a person could actually live with this diet plan, not only would he/she lose weight, but blood sugars would be in complete control. There are too few choices in acceptable foods and too many no-nos. It is similar to Phase One of South Beach Diet, which is doable for two weeks but too strict for the long haul."
2,A little too much preaching,"The author spends too much time berating the bad eating habits of Americans and not enough time providing practical, usable advice. Get to the point - we already know we have a problem, that's why we PAID for your book. We want good advice, not preaching."
2,The Diabetic Diet Book,I purchase the book in hopes of finding information on how to treat my own diabetes. I found the information in the book to be old and out of date. The diet itself will be almost impossible to stick to as it cuts out most foods except for a small list which is in the book. The author recommends purchasing Da Vinci syrups and claims it will have no effect on blood sugar. I did purchase the syrup and it spiked my blood sugar almost immediately. Look up the author on the internet and you will find little support for his approach. I would recommend you look elsewhere for ways to treat your diabetes.
3,"Information which is helpful to the newly diagnosed diabetic,","Although I didn't learn much new, it did give me some new ideas and menus which are helpful. Some of the information is new but other much is a rehash of things I already knew."
3,Diabetes Diet,Gives a simplified overview of the scientific reasons for this solution to eating for optimising your diabetic condition. Excellent recipes that really work to lower blood sugars to a non-diabetic level. Lifesaving.
1,useless,"this book was useless. I am not interested in what foods contain very little carbs. i already know that, and most likely you do too.i was hoping this book would tell you how to better dose the amount of insulin you take while on a low carb diet. it doesn't even mention anything close to that.the main problem with most low carb diets for diabetics is dosing your insulin so you don't go too low, because if you do go low, then have to have a lot of carbs to bring up your blood sugar level. as most diabetics who have tried a low carb diet know, eating low carb is not the problem, it's not going too low on your blood sugars.and he doesn't mention any effective ways to bring up your blood sugars if you go low.in addition to that, the first 70 pages of the book are spent trying to convince you of his beliefs in low carb diets. only about 10 pages are devoted to telling you what he believes is a low carb diet."
2,Should have been more info on book,"I was upset with the book. My mistake, but was unaware he has and is writing this book as a man with type 1 diabetes. I am just learning about the disease since being diagnosed, but am type 2 and there is a world of differnce between the both of them. It scared me and I put the book down and will not read any more of it. I got other books that are helping me adjust to this illness."
3,Not what I hoped for....,"This is certainly an informative book, but really, the diet part is not much different from any other low carb diet--except maybe harder than some. If I was a Type 1 and this was going to get me off insulin, I'd do it. As it is, I am committed to going lower carb, but some of what is said here does not apply to me. Milk is forbidden here---milk stabilizes my sugar, to the point that the one dessert I can eat is REAL ice cream, I get only a 10 pt. rise in one hour. Also, soy is encouraged and for anyone with weight issues--women especially--soy is ESTROGENIC in its effect on the body and is NOT good for us. Anyway, this book was highly recommended and for someone who hasn't spent over a decade doing their own research may well be eye opening, for me it was no help. Bummed."
3,helpful memory tool for med school,"Do NOT rely on this book for board study, because the medical licensing exams are moving away from buzzwords. I had very few if any buzzwords on my USMLE. However, many medical schools still use buzzwords on their exams, and it is an easy book to skim through before tests if you have extra time."
3,Good supplement,"Good book as a quick review, but certainly not complete or sufficient on its own. It lives up to its title by highlighting ""buzzwords""..which is very important in the actual exam. The format may not appeal to everyone and is best used during a final review. Contains a few mistakes. I would not say it is necessary for Step 1. I used it as a ""break"" from studying ""real"" books and to see how much I had retained. It highlights important details but is not comprehensive."
3,Meh. It's just okay,"This is a pretty good test of how well you studied material, but not a good way to review material for boards. Pretty much you will go through the book and be in love with yourself for having memorized a bunch of facts from notes and other reviews, or you won't. There are minimal explanations to mechanisms or etiologies, and a few mnemonics that seem helpful. Other than that, I just used it as a way to determine how well I had understood material from other sources. If you buy a 200 page paperback with writing on half of each page and expect to have a board review book, you aren't studying right."
2,Needs work,"Has the potential for being a very helpful book, but I found it to be filled with repeated questions and incorrect information - suprising for a 2nd edition. Wouldn't recommend this book until someone does a much better job editing it."
5,This is a great book for USLME step 1,This definitely helped me remember more facts quite faster in preparation for the USMLE Step 1. The book focuses on key facts and topics that are so important to know in order to pass the test. I also used the following books that are also available on amazon.com:Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers(ISBN: 0971999635)Spinal Anatomy Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers(ISBN: 0971999600)The last two study guides helped me know the type of questions that were asked on the USMLE Step 1. I used these three books and passed the USMLE Step 1 the first time. I had a few friends who recommened the microbiology study guide. I'm glad I took their advice.
1,Shipping cost almost as much as items !,Happy with the 1GB card but I will never purchase from this company again. I was charged over $3 shipping on each card I purchased (3) so the shipping was over $9 even though they were put into the same little envelope when they were mailed to me.
4,Memory card for your memories,"Well, it's a memory card--if you want to store up to 1GB worth of data of any kind, and you have an MMC compatible device, this is one of the media cards you could use :)Fair priced and works just fine. (It doesn't prepare my morning coffee though, yet?!)"
4,Impressive!,Good vocals. Good songs. A CD that I'm proud to have and would not hesitate to recommend to my friends (Filipino or otherwise). More power to Pinay! Can't wait for your next one!
4,PINAY REVIEW,"This Cd is okay, but its mainly one girl who is leading the whole group. Pinay should sing as a whole group, not just one person. However, Next Time still continues to be one of my favorite songs!"
2,"so-so, but no thanks","The girls know show business as the cover reveals them in trendy outfits and professionally done hair and make-up. The singing? There's really only one, maybe two, with good voices. The others could've been at a karaoke bar. The songs have the same beat, same lyrics, same style. If you wanna save yourself some money, don't get it. Otherwise, their version of ""Dahil Sa'yo"" would one of the few reasons to get it."
2,Weak,"This is pretty weak, late '80s stuff from Golden Earring. I haven't heard their new stuff since -Most of it makes it to the US only on import, but their late '70s and early '80s releases are much better. You can skip this one, even if you are a fan."
5,This brought back many memories of my early school days.,"This wonderful book was in great condition, considering it's age. I do wish I could have gotten the records that used to come with these books. In the early 50's in my area, country schools still operated and that was for our music class."
4,Trike for Tot,"This is a neat first trike for a girl. She liked the storage space in the rear and the adjustable seat and foldable option are helpful. Nevertheless, I was very disappointed in the ""tires"" which were described as rubber in the blurb.Beware! They are hard plastic! False advertising, if you ask me."
2,Presented incorrectly,"First of all it was mailed in a soft carton envelope which was broken through when I got it. It should be mailed in a box. The product is a powdered mix, not a ready to drink liquid, label says 14.1 oz. not 18 oz. I happen to be having a problem with my hands so opening/closing the envelope and mixing the powder is a problem. Description should say powdered mix."
1,"Chemicals, anyone?","I love real guanabana and have such fond memories of eating it while I lived in South America. This powdered guanabana drink, however, was a real disappointment because more than anything it smells and tastes like an overpowering chemical version of the fruit. One look at the ingredient list on the back and it becomes clear why. So disappointing!!"
5,Great,"A great introduction to the Warren Court. If you are looking research this era of the Supreme Court,this is surely the book to start at."
4,"Megadeth ""Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?""","I am personally glad that Dave Mustaine, however it was to come about, did not remain in Metallica, and started his own superior, legendary thrash band. Metallica has clearly lost its roots, its vision, and its popularity with true metal fans such as myself, and I'm sure many of you as well. This album is a cornerstone of its genre. I believe it's bested overall by 1990's Rust In Peace, but in my humble opinion, the 2 to 3 outstanding tracks on this album top anything in the entire Megadeth catalogue.Standout Tracks: Peace Sells, Devil's Island, Wake Up Dead"
3,Has some good moments.,"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? is pretty good. There's no doubt that it's really heavy. The guitar playing is cool and Chris Poland is a really talented guitarist--his album Return to Metalopolis is impressive. Not all of the songs on Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? are memorable, but it does have some good moments. My favorite tunes are ""Wake Up Dead"" and ""Peace Sells."" Both of those songs have some infectious guitar playing on them. Megadeth's musicianship is never disappointing. I admit that I don't listen to this album much, but it's still quite good."
4,4 1/2 stars Beats the dreadful low budget debut.,"Dave Mustaine at his angriest. Many classics again such as ""Wake Up Dead"",""Peace Sells"" love the bass intro. Megadeth's fastest by far just listen to the guitars on ""Good Mourning"" just wrist breaking speeds. And have there lyrics changed big time just read them next time you listen to this cd. almost a 5 but hell almost all megadeth records are 4 1/2 stars and Better Except ""Killings is my Business"" and their latest ""Risk"
4,Neo-Megadeth sells - But whos' buying?,"Well, I'm sore quite a few Metallica/Megadeth - fans agee with me as I say, that they've lost a great deal of their innovation, enthusiasm and energy along teh years - which haven't been easy for either of the groups. That's why it's allways a pleasure to review such calssics as this. ""PSBWB"" is, without doubt a very enegic album. Dave Mustaine and co. are at their best. This is not a perfect album, I have to say, but with it's unresistable energy it can knock you off your chair. But hey, isn't Mustaine nicer when he has cooled down?..."
4,Freedom Fffighter,I think Peace Sells... is one of Megadeths best.If I were Dave I would re-make it.
3,hard to get over Dave's singing,"Well, I think this album is a bit overrated. Repetitive riffage and horrible singing. The lead guitar work is brilliant though. This album is heavy at times, and that's what merits the 3 stars it gets. Though musically, it gets boring. It is heavy though and that counts for a lot."
4,HEY KIDS!,"Hey kids! Tired of the same old boaring bands that clame there metal but just play two notes and rap in every song? Then try MEGADETH! Yes Megadeth, a true metal band that you can bang your head to. Megadeth contains no raping and is fun for kids of all ages."
5,A metal landmark,"After leaving Metallica, Dave Mustaine disappointed me with ""Killing Is My Business"". So imagine how shocked I was when I heard this album and found it to be even more tuneful and agressive than Metallica's ""Ride the Lightning"".""Wake Up Dead"" is one of the heaviest metal tunes ever. Period. The title track is one of the most politically insightful songs I've ever heard. ""Peace Sells"" also features one of the most incredible and memorable bass riffs in recent memory. Add other stand outs like ""Black Friday"", ""Devil's Island"" and the stunning ""My Last Words"", and you've got one of metal's finest hours.Megadeth has yet to make an album with even half the intensity of ""Peace Sells .. But Who's Buying?"", and fans who started listening to Megadeth after seeing their videos on MTV may not like the incredibly forceful and propulsive sound, but anyone with a passing interest in great metal (Black Sabbath, older Metallica, Motorhead, Death Angel) should have this recording. It's that good."
5,A great album,I honestly dont care if someone thinks this album is cheesy or the album covers look like they came out of a horror movie the person that wrote that is just mad that megadeth is better than metallica and they need to get over it and stop trying to sell therye stupid thoughts on this cd on the internet this is one of metals greatest albums.
5,Skull Crushing Good Music!,"This Is The First Metal Album I Ever Bought, 14 Years Latter I'm Still Jaming To It!One Of The Best Works In Metal History!A Must Have For Any Megadeth Or 80's Metallica Fan.The First 4 Songs Truly Rock!Wake Up Deead,The Power Chords Roar Striking Much Stompng Emotions Causing You To Rattle Your Damn Head!!!!!The Cunjering......What Else Can I Say It's Megadeth It Rocks.Peace Sells,The First Megadeth Song I Ever Heard And One Of My Personal All Time Favorites. A Lot Of Polatics In This One And I Think Between The Song And The Video (If You Ever Seen It) Defines What Megadeth Realy Stands For.Devils Island,Exelent Tune My 3rd Favorite On The Album, But I Must Admit I Love Every Track!Like It Heavy?Like It Fast?Buy This Cd!!!!!!Bruises And Broken Bones,Mechanix711"
4,2nd Best Metal Album of '86,"Megadeth are a good band, but in the 80's they've always been considered second best. Let's get one thing out of the way, Metallica's Ride the Lighting was NOT dominantly written by Mustaine, as only the title track and parts of Ktulu were written by Mustaine. Anyway, this album has some good riffs , but the lyrics are completely out of context in most places, and the songs barely reach 5 minutes. This is second best to Master of Puppets (the best thrash album of all time) for best metal album of '86. It's good and all, but just doesn't have the epic compositions of Metallica's classic."
4,Get Better By The Album: Megadeth Gears Up For Supremacy,"Dave Mustaine proved a small point with Killing Is My Business by creating his vehicle for destruction: Megadeth. Have been fired from Metallica, Dave is hell-bent on ruling the world and Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? is one step closer to realizing his stranglehold on the thrash metal genre. Less than perfect...Peace sells us some pretty great Megadeth standards. The title track is flawless and classic. Devil's Island is the albums second most powerful track. Wake Up Dead is one of Megadeth's staples though not one of my personal favorites. I Ain't Superstitious is a great cover. Good Mourning/Black Friday explores the musicianship of the band in a real way. The lyrics are still a little mindless and dull here, but you can feel the evolution of Megadeth as a force to be reckoned with culminating on this disc.Dig it!"
4,One of Megadeth's best,"I can't believe no one reviewed this one yet. The first three albums were their best, especially this one. At the time, Megadeth were known as ""State of the Art Speed Metal."" This was about as fast and heavy as you could go and still be melodic. I miss all days when music had balls to it. This is speed metal at its best. The entire alternative scene s****. They're all a bunch of spoiled little rich kids who hate the world because Daddy bought them a Honda instead of a Porsche for their 16th birthday. The entire second side rules, especially the gory ""Black Friday"" and a speed metal song about Russian Roulette called ""My Last Words."" Megadeth started slowing down with each album after their third but at least they didn't never became flat out butt rock like their sister band whose name I'll refrain from mentioning. If you like heavy, fast, and still melodic music, you'll love this one."
5,Peace Sells The best album of all time,There is no other album ever created that is better than this. Blows any other thrash metal albums away. No other Megadeth album even comes close to this masterpiece. Not even the Phenominal Rust in Peace beats this.1 Wake Up Dead-5 stars no song begins an album better.2 The Conjuring-5 stars A scary song about devil worship great guitar work.3 Peace Sells-5 stars Great baseline along with great lyrics.4 Devils Island-5 stars incredible rythm guitar work.5 Black Friday-5 stars the best song on the album.great intro grusome lyrics great solos.6 Bad Omen-5 stars great intro.7 I Ain't superstitious-4 stars incredible speed.8 My Last Words-5 stars an unbelievible song. The last two minutes are mindblowing.This is Thrash metal perfection.Buy this album.It is the best album ever.
3,3 and 1/2 stars Very Good,"THis is one very good CD.It may not be as good as ""Rust in Peace"" but it is worth the purchace price.It is easy to put aside the twisted political message and just listen to the songs.""Wake up Dead"" ""Peace Sells"" ""Devils Island"" and ""Bad Omen"" are the best trax on the record.There is a silly cover song called ""I ain't Superstitious"" that I could have done without.The only other bad thing about this CD is the Fairly sloppy production.Vocals that seem to lose or gain volume for no good reason.Dave Mustane became a better producer over the years this is just not one of his Best efforts as a producer.This CD would sound great if they would Remaster it."
2,"Poor, Poor DVD quality.","Let me say that this is a terrible re-print of this movie. It looks like it was transferred from a bootleg VHS tape. It is cropped on all four corners and the colors are bleeding everywhere. This ""insta-action"" also is the biggest joke i have seen. It makes the whole DVD skip to certain scenes and you don't know what is going on.It is a shame these classic movies are only getting re-mastered in Asia and not encoded for DVD players over here. Whatever you do, stay away from this edition of this movie."
2,Really overrated,"If you want to know a previous work to Dark Side of the Moon, please choose Atom Heart Mother or Meddle. Saurceful is a great experiment, very complex and is the base to the later (and better) recordings. But no more."
5,Pink Floyd - 'A Saucerful Of Secrets' (Capitol),"Originally released in 1968,as this was the band's second record.Technically speaking,'A Saucerful...' may JUST be the first ever 'space rock' album.Remember,even though founder Syd Barrett was booted out of the group after the release of 1967's 'The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn' lp,he managed to appear on just one track here,""Jugband Blues"".There are some vintage pieces of work here that I haven't heard in years,until recently.Such as,the anthem-like ""Let There Be More Light"",their landmark ""Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun""(like the longer/live versions of this tune as well),their twelve-minute epic title cut ""A Saucerful Of Secrets"" and ""See-Saw"".For any 'younger' whipper-snappers out there that may be reading this review,'A Saucerful...' is a must-have and a true keeper.Highly recommended."
5,Take a journey.,"I like ""A saucerful of Secrets"" a lot. It is experimental, it is psycadellic, it is spacy. Of course it is. This is what we wanted from PF in 1968. We didn't want Beatle music, we had plenty of that (love beatles). My friends and I were in a special place and PF was there to take us even farther. I like to listen to the whole CD when I play it.P.S. We would have been dissapointed if the '68 album would have been ""Dark side of the Moon"". We would have said ""Too comercial"" & ""They sold out!"". DSOTM is a perfect PF album for when it came out."
3,A Saucerful of Secrets,"Bueno, la primera vez que escuché este disco fue en 1975 y real-mente no me gustó, quizá esperaba algo similar a The Dark side of the Moon. Ahora lo he vuelto a escuchar y no está tan mal, creo que lo mejor para mi es Set the controls to the heart of the Sun y Seasow. El tema A Saurcerful of Secrets el cual seríael principal aun no me puede gustar. Es mejor escucharlo en elVideo Las Ruinas de Pompeya. Este es un disco como para coleccionistas y corresponde a una etapa muy inicial de Pink Floyd."
4,Saucer is not full!,"The sound of early Pink Floyd, 1968 to be precise. This record is also in the line first album 'Piper at the gates of dawn', but while listening to it you would certainly feel the lack of polish in the tracks. The concept is not bad at all, only the solid sound present in later Floyd album is somewhat missing.'Set the controls of the heart of the Sun' is definately innovative and should be regarded as one of Floyd's best. Syd's 'Jugband Blues' is also good. So are other 5 tracks but production is not good and Pink Floyd was still learning the art of making an album. Except for the scattered brilliance of 'Piper at the gates of dawn' and this album, they finally mastered the art in album 'Meddle'. Then came 'Dark side of the moon' and the rest is history.Fans should own this, casual listeners may skip this. Pink Floyd did not delivered their full sound in this."
2,you need to know the story....,"Before you yell ""sophmore jinx"" at this album. Sure, there are only two really good songs here ( the Rick Wright penned ""Remember a Day"" and the group-written title track, a true showcase for each individual member's strengths ) that hold up to repeated listening. But what must be remembered is that the Floyd's main singer and songwriter Syd Barret ( who was largely responsible for the genius first album ) was in the middle of a complete and utter mental breakdown due to copious ingestion of psychedelic drugs when this album was recorded, and was all but absent from the recording, having been effectively replaced by vocalist/guitarist David Gilmour. Read one of the many Pink Floyd biographies for the lurid details, then listen to this album and cut 'em some slack, for God's sake."
3,Good For It's Time.,"Don't get me wrong, this album has some memorable tracks like Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun and See-Saw, but it just seems to me that at this point in time Pink Floyd sounded a little bit too much like The Beatles. I think anyone who is new to Pink Floyd(don't know who?) should start with their next album, Dark Side Of The Moon and go from there. As I said in the title, I'm sure this album was a landmark in 1967, but compared to their later works, it's really just not memorable."
5,"It's Pink Floyd, duh . . .","You don't need to read a review of Pink Floyd's music; you just need to listen to it!!! Apparently I didn't type enough words for this review. I hope this fulfills the minimum requirement. BTW, I saw them at Hill Auditorium on the campus of the University of Michigan in 1973. It doesn't get any better!!!"
2,thurd track rocks,Hi y'all my brother gaves me this disc coz he liked the cova.I trieds to play it but was swept aside with disgust.This is as if all the artists are asleep. Yawn yawn. Only the thurd track rocks for its wildness but overall this is a - put-it-in-your-toilet-record. A wasset of money.
1,The Worst Floyd Album,Stay away from this album. It's awful. The songs are just sounds thrown together.
2,A Saucerful of...?,"This album is, without a doubt, as drab as they get. Coming off of the expiremental ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" the band decided to record their next album (or their first with Gilmour), which is what you are looking at now. The band rid themselves of Syd during the sessions (he plays on ""Corporal Clegg"" and his own ""Jugband Blues"") and Syd's absence shows horribly on the other tracks. Those two are OK tracks (Clegg is rather stupid, but hey, we all make mistakes!) and Jugband Blues is pretty much all this album can go on. It bombed drastically upon release in 1968. Instead of blowing your money on this you'd be better off getting a compilation (""Echoes"" - for example) to give you an overview. Skip this one."
3,For Nastalgia,Pink Floyd has adapted to the times (thank goodness) leaving their older albums reminiscent of the seventies. Still a great trip down memory lane if you were into them back then.
2,"Okay, but not great","Now I know this was a transitional album from Syd to Dave. But I must say this is the weakest Floyd album I've heard (Neck to neck with THE FINAL CUT). I kinda like ""Corp. Clegg"" and the title track still sounds great, but the whole thing just doesn't gel. ""Jugband Blues"" is the weirdest commercial track I've heard by an English-speaking artist."
4,A Spoonful of Floyd,"Released June 1968, this album continues the psychedelic music from Pink Floyd's first album, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but Barrett's nutty fairytales are replaced by more space-rock, such as ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"", and Roger Water's first Floyd song about war, ""Corporal Clegg"". It was a transitional album as they were in the process of booting out their leader, Syd Barrett, due to his bizarre behavior."
3,"Alright, but simply overrated by most","this album is pretty-good but is overall lacking in complete sophistication. It was in wany respects a stepping stone towards the peak of Floyd's later triumphs. Must haves in this album include most definately wrigh't s best exposition and my favorite song of the album and Barrett's mediocre musically but substantial lyrically departing song Jugband blues as wella as the unforgetable and deep classic Set ther controls for the heart of the Sun. HOWEVER, SINCE I HOLD ROGER WATERS TO HIGHER EXPECTATIONS THAN THE REST OF THE BAND (CONSIDERING GILMOUR HADN'T ARRIVED YET AND BARRETT WAS ON A DOWNSWING) I DON'T BELIEVE SONGS LIKE CORPORAL CLEGG AND THE INFERIOR TO UMMAGUMMA SAUCERFUL... STAND UP TO TIME AS WELL AS MOST GOOF FLOYDIAN SONGS DO. IT'S NOT THAT THIS IS A BAD ALBUM, I TRULY JUST BELIEVE IT'S OVERRATED BECAUSE IT IS FLOYD'S FIRST ""POST- BARRETT"" (WITH EXCEPTION TO JUGBAND BLUES) RECORDING."
4,An imaginative and psychedelic CD,"This is one of the most creative and innovative albums ever. This album is one of Pink Floyd's earliest. It includes the great song Set The Controls For the Heart of the Sun. If you want a Pink Floyd CD in which their songs are most imaginative and psychedelic this is the album for you. None of the tracks are commercialized in any way, and David Gilmour explores new musical arenas with his guitar. Simply a good CD, but have you heard of a Floyd CD that isn't."
5,"PINK FLOYD's ""A Saucerful Of Secrets"" is a hidden gem","Pink Floyds ""a saucerful of secrets"" is an overlooked Floyd masterpeice. This CD is bursting with psychedelic goodies. This a good glimps of Pink Floyds song style. It has the shorter diddys and the ten minute long prog rock epics that give Pink Floyd their name."
2,Ok for extremely small companies,"We purcahsed this to do forecasting for our company. However, I quickly found it extremley limited for doing forecasting. For small home businesses this may be ok. After doing more research and reading reviews I use DecisionPro by Vanguard Software. Whatever you decide - avoid the Excel plug-in software programs out there altogether - those are worthless."
1,Arrived DOA - Chance you take,"Item was purchased as is w/ no guarantee at a terrific price. Most of the time you do get what you paid for. Item arrived with broken lid and was inoperable. Some you win, some you lose."
5,Brilliant,"Kevin has brought DareDevil back in action whit a brilliant story, a must for all comic enjoyers!"
2,Incomplete and unnecessary,"No, Marvel Comics should NOT have released this in paperback form. The story was inconsistent and unfinished. Not a single trace of a true ""ending."" I was disappointed with the way this book was rushed to publication without the thoughts of the reader's confusement. I would gladly return this book for a full refund if I could. I would recommend ""Daredevil: Visionaries"" as an alternative."
3,missing pages,when i purchased this product i was unaware that it would be missing several pages which were two of the songs that i wanted it for.
2,"Great idea, but flawed execution?","I have an olympus Stylus 770 SW waterproof camera and successfully have taken it down to 70 feet, way deeper than its 33 foot rating. No problem, but when you dive a lot, the camera gets little scratches and dents from banging against rocks and being dragged over sand and such. So I ordered the skin for the 770. It comes in an Olympus-branded package and seems absolutely precision-crafted, just what you need. From that standpoint I'd give it a 5-star rating, or better! BUT, mine clean ripped apart the very first time I inserted the camera, just ripped. That simply should not happen with a brand-name silicone skin."
4,Does It's Job,"The camera is not difficult to insert, and the function of the buttons are not impaired in any way. However you must remove the camera from the skin to take battery/memory card out, and to upload images. Which can get annoying, and I wonder if it will wear out in time. It makes the camera easy to grip as well, and offers sufficient protection.Olympus Stylus 770SW 7.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)"
1,Arrived DOA,"Hopefully this is the exception rather than the rule, but my TV arrived in non-working condition. There were no outwards signs of damage, and cosmetically it looks fine, but it won't power on. Or rather it powers on for about 5 seconds and then shuts off with the green power LED on the front blinking.I contacted Sharp support and they said they will have a local service company come to fix it, but it looks like that will take a week or more. Meanwhile I'm left looking at a black screen."
1,Defective TV,"Let me preface my statement that I ordered a Sony Bravia last year and all went well, the purchase, the delivery and the TV were all great. I recently purchased the Sharp Aquos and it turned out to be defective-no power, no picture, a pain - but I did receive a full refund but had to pay shipping- not so good."
1,Bad belt,"This belt is terrible. It started to fray almost immediately and you can feel the lack of quality as soon as you touch it. This belt appears several times on Amazon as separate items, but I believe they are all the same. Unless you absolutely need a belt and have no other options, I would not recommend this. If you're looking for a belt to put a buckle on, find another one."
1,NOT LEATHER,"*FALSE ADVERTISING**FALSE ADVERTISING**FALSE ADVERTISING*The title says it all. These belts are NOT LEATHER, they are cheap man made material."
5,x-lg Brown belt suited for all buckles,I like a good quality belt. My son needed a brown belt to go with a buckle that I order off Amazon. Thanks again.
1,All color Leather Belt,"Give me a break, Real leather???? from what ? this is not real leather and should not be sold as real. It is real something that I would never buy again and wish I could send back."
3,very basic belt,"I bought this belt in black to go with a buckle. For the price this is a good belt. My only complaint would be that it is very stiff, otherwise fine. It is a good choice if you're going for showing off JUST your belt buckle!"
1,"poor quality, do not wear with light-colored pants","I purchased this belt in brown and black. While the brown belt was fine, I tried on the black belt with a pair of khaki pants. The black dye from the belt bled onto my pants and is still there after several washes. I did not expect the belts to be of high quality leather (based on the price), but I did expect to be able to wear the belt with any pair (and color) of pants without leaving a black ring around the waist of my pants. You definitely get what you pay for. Oh... and it took 2 full weeks for the belts to arrive. I received a shipment email, no tracking for the package was ever available, and my emails to the seller went unanswered until after I received the belts (2 days after the estimated delivery date.) Not satisfactory!"
4,"""Be your own lamps, Your own refuge""","This book is a good introduction to Buddha the man. There are times that it drags a bit, but in general it was a fast read and provided the fundamentals of Buddha's life and a beginning understanding of his teachings. I liked the discussion of the Four Noble truths and the Eightfold path which made the teachings straightforward. All to often we get mired in the ennumerable teachings that exist in a religious/ philosophy/ psychology such as Buddhism or Yoga and forget that the purpose of these teachings was to make our lives simple, balanced, honest and it is not all that hard to do. Reading a book like this brings us back to our essence."
4,Simple and easy to understand.,"For a noob like me, this was a great introductory book. It is written simply and it is easy to understand. I actually bought this copy to re-read over the years after reading a copy I borrowed from the library."
5,Bisbal on the move,"He is selling well all over the world. He is the new sensation David Bisbal. He is from an American Idol version type show in Spain called Operacion Triunfo. The cd is excellent. It has excellent dance songs like Ave Maria, Corazon Latino, and Llorare Las Penas. Just make sure you get the american version of the cd is that it comes with a special DVD which is worth the money itself. It is about a hour and a half long and has a lot of footage like when he started on the show and stuff. It also has the video for Ave Maria and live versions of Corazon Latino, pictures, interviews and making of the video Ave Maria. So if you want to get up close and personal with him get this cd."
4,david bisbal,I think david bisbal is the future for spanish music all over the world he has a great future ahead and can't wait to see ifhe goes for an english speaking cd and cross over it would be wonderful.
2,CD is at best average,"This CD was given to me as a gift. I was never really sold on this artist before receiving this CD, but I decided to lay aside my prejudice. After hearing the CD my opinion did not change of Bisbal. His music is not as innovative as an Alejandro Sanz, Alex Ubago, Chayenne or Luis Miguel. His style is a little overplayed and I got a little tired of the CD after a while. I would not really recommend this CD, his act is a like a poor man's Ricky Martin. I would recommend it for people who do not hear too much latin music, therefore his style will be a little bit more refreshing than it was to me."
5,Corazon Latino,"Great CD! Lots of good songs and definitely a worthwhile purchase.Every song has a great beat.. can use it for parties, dancing, or just a plain pick me up.I'd buy it again anytime."
4,Excellent Star,"David Bisbal is an excellent young singer with a lot of potential and charisma. You can see his passion for music when he performs on stage. For those of you who are not familiar with David, let me tell you, he is very popular in Spain. Bisbal is known for his sexy curly hair. He's like America's version of Justin from NYSNC. His best hits are Ave Maria and Corazon Latino. They have a great latin beat that really gets you moving. If you have a love for latin music David Bisbal is really worth checking out. The girls go crazy over the way he moves his hips when dancing. ¡¡¡Cuatro estrellas para Bisbal!!!"
3,Good but outdated,"This book is a good guide to application process, but the problem is that's It's written in 1997, and many things (especially related to Internet) changed since then."
2,Spyro hint book review,"This is a nice book. I say nice because it does tell you what to do but not how to do it! There are some parts where I was completely stumped, so I bought the book. It still didn't help me so I am going to buy the other one and see how it is."
3,Not 100% needed,"Even though I needed this book,I think it is not all that needed if you arrange the levels in a good way.You should try the game,as hard as you can to complete it,before you get this book."
5,Awesome,"I got this for my dad for Christmas, and he loves it. He plays it constantly. Still, after 3 months, he still isn't bored with it. His favorite game in here is Rack-O. I'm definitely happy that I got it for him."
1,Do Not Buy..,"The ""programmed opponents"" play with an IQ less than 90. For example in HEARTS an opponent will lead an Ace or Queen-of-Spades.....and make no subsequent effort to take hearts..!!!...If you like winning.....you will love this CD-ROM"
3,Parker Brothers Card Games (Jewel Case),I bought this game to replace one that was no longer working right. I think that I played it so much that I wore out the disc. I really like this disc (especially Racko). The new disc works just fine and I am very happy with it.
5,As good as I remembered it,"This is a classic.My teacher read it to me in my little church school. Now that I read it to my own students I find that I still love it and it still inspires me.Mr. Hare had a real passion for what he was doing, God and the Karen people."
5,The Best Fiddler on the Roof,"I have both a Broadway and this film soundtrack of Fiddler on the Roof. Both star Topol as Tevye the milkman. I enjoy the film soundtrack much more than the Broadway soundtrack. To me, the singing and orchestrations of the film Fiddler are superior. I also feel that Topol gave a more impassioned performance in this 1971 motion picture soundtrack than in the Broadway soundtrack that I own. If you like Fiddler on the Roof and want to purchase a soundtrack, make it this one."
3,Youngstown Glove 03-3200-78-M Anti-Vibe XT Performance Glove Medium,I purchased these for myself because I spend so much time in my shop working on woodworking projects. I sand a lot with a hand held sander and the vibrations are very hard on my hands. These gloves have helped very little and lasted about 2 hours before the seams started opening up. I would never purchase them again. Very unhappy with their performance.
4,Good gloves if you have wrist problems,"I got these gloves to use with vibrating tools such as line trimmers, blowers, drills, saws, etc. They fasten around the wrist to give extra support and are pretty effective. Use of the gloves has reduced that numbing/tingling sensation after using tools for long periods. I also use them for support when lifting heavy objects. Well worth the money."
4,Good for light duty,I bought these for a light-vibration activity --- holding the electric hedge trimmer. They are comfortable and are doing the job. But I don't know how well they'd work for heavier equipment that might vibrate more.
1,Did Not Dampen Vibration for Hand-Held Sander,I wanted to cut vibration caused by my DeWalt five inch rotary sander. These gloves did not help so I returned them. Still looking
1,No vibration protection,"I ordered these gloves only to use w/my weedeater as the vibration from the machine was causing my hand on the throttle and my elbow on the same arm to go numb after about 15-20 minutes. Thought that these would cure that. Not so.The gloves only seemed to make the condition worse. While the vibration to the elbow seemed to be better, the vibration to my hand seemed much worse as the hand will go completely numb after only about 15 min. Maybe that's the way they're designed (to keep the vibration localized) and if that's the case, it may be a good product - just not for me."
5,comfy glove,"A bit pricey but pleasant. Good comfortable friendly fit, light weight, very pliable yet plenty tough. padded palm and thumb... fingers less so = no cumbersome bulk for finer work. wide elastic wrist strap for that secure feel. Slower to put on and take off but supple enough so you don't have to take them off that often. (Yes you can work a zipper.)"
5,A Christian's prospective of deer hunting AND life.,"I had a hard time with this book . . .I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! It is an excellent book, and I recommend it to all deerhunters, especially Christian deerhunters! It's an easy, interesting read and I am going to buy copies of this book for my huntin' buddies, which include my teenage sons. Steve Chapman draws the reader into a vivid situation, allowing the reader to feel as if he is in the woods sitting in the tree stand. Also, the author shares his personal views about many areas of life. This book makes you think about many different things! Buy it--you'll like it!"
4,A Look At Life From A Deer Stand,"This book was very enjoyable. It is written in the form of short chapters that tell multiple deer hunting stories that are then compared to ones personal relationship with God and family. Any hunter, sportsman, or outdoorsman can easily relate to the stories in this book. I would recommend reading A Look At Life From A Deer Stand, because it helps us hunters better understand how God, family, and hunting all tie in together to make our lives more enjoyable."
2,Buy the paperback edition instead!,"I give the paperback edition 5 stars, but the gift edition is not the same. It only contains short, choppy excerpts from the actual book. The book is short to begin with, but the gift edition can be read cover to cover in about 15 minutes. From Amazon's description, I thought the gift edition was the same as the original, with additional artwork thrown in. I was wrong. I am only sharing this so that others can take this into account when placing their orders. Thanks!"
1,a look at life from a deer stand,very disappointed in the text of the gift edition.if your under 13 years old you may enjoy it...the pictures are good.
4,very fine book of hunting for life with God,"I received this book for Christmas and enjoyed its insights and thoughts on a variety of subjects. Good gift book for the hunting Christian. If you liked this book, I would suggest another called Wild at Heart by John Eldrege"
2,Biosilk... Product,"I'm used to buying it at a Salon and for whatever reason this appeared to be old as it does not blend like it always has before when you get a scoop out of the container, some of it blends but some is very sticky and won't spread thru hair!!!"
5,QUE VIVA EL CAUDILLO!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I never had thought highly of Francisco Franco until I read this book, along with Paul Preston's biography. I now realize that Franco was, indeed, a crusader; the last of his kind. Unlike the truly diabolical European dictators, such as Hitler or Stalin, General Franco was not fighting a perceived enemy, but a real and evil one. This book explains exactly why this enemy needed getting rid of."
4,Emotional Truth,"Coming of Age in Mississippi is an extremely well written book full of emotion and truth. This book gives a disturbing, but true account of growing up in a racist southern town. Although oppressed, Anne Moody brilliantly displays her pride, courage, and determination to overcome the circumstances she grew up in. This familiar part of our nation's history is seen through the perspective of an innocent girl living out this horror, therefore giving today's society an intricate look into racism and oppression."
3,Coming of Age in Mississippi Review,"Coming of Age in Mississippi was a great book. It begins with Anne being a very young girl living with both her mother and father on a plantation. As the story progresses, Anne herself moves on in life. Living in many different places and experiencing many life altering events.The best part of the book for me was her high school years. I like the fact that this young girl coming from such a poor background could become so popular and even be elected homecoming queen. She also played basketball at this time while continuing to work and keep up her studies. She was very inspiring.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book to read, but not only that to actually learn some things you might have never known."
5,An Aged Mississippian,"This book is very moving and touching. Anne Moody's autobiography, ""Coming of Age in Mississippi"" is a wonderful book that tells the story of Anne's struggles growing up poor and black in the rural south. The author captures the reader's attention in the first few paragraphs using some slang dialect. We had vivid pictures in our minds of what was happening in the story through all of the use of imagery. There is a vivid image of a ""rotten wood two room shack"" as you read the pages. This book is well written and easy to read. It also helps one realize how many small steps it takes for ones dreams of a wonderful future to come true. We would love to meet Anne Moody, and we are thanking her for enabling us to get a glimpse of her life."
4,Good read,Long book but eye opening. such a sad part of history. Very good history lesson for high schoolers to read
3,ok,"The book was okay. At times it was powerful and at others it was so boring. she presented a lot of events in the book that were not central to the main theme. I know it's about her life, but a lot of things were really pointless if you ask me. I sympathized a lot with her, but i really did not like the book. Yawn!"
3,"It was okay, not as impressive as I thought it would be.","It was pretty accurate in portraying the mood of the south during that time frame, however I felt her storytelling was a bit simplistic and incomplete with regards to her life and seemed to lack the intricate details I searched for through out the whole book. I appreciate the history lesson but seemed like not very much seemed focused in intimate details of her coming of age."
3,Many emotions,"The beginning of the book was strange to me. Once I got into the flow of the writing I started to enjoy it. Once Essie/Anne hits the movements though, she comes off as a zealot and expects everyone to feel and do the same as she does. There are many emotions in this book. The last part of the book was a bit tedious and repititious, then hits a crescendo, and then falls flat. I was disappointed with the way Anne Moody ends the book, but it's still a good read."
5,amazing account of history,"If you want to understand truly the insanity of the prejudice in the south, this book is the truth. Written from a woman who lived it and fought for her freedom and that of her race. It is difficult to read at times. I had to put it down in disgust at the hatred and cruelty that white men have shown to Blacks in our country. It is so well written and should be used as a historical novel in English classes in our schools. Moody had so much courage at such a young age. Pass this one on. Use it in book clubs. Excellent."
5,Great Book. American History,"Great Book. I had to read it for my History Class, my mom later read it and loved it.This is American History, everyone should read it."
5,Amazing. A MUST read.,"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. ""Of Coming Age In Mississippi"" shows segregation and Civil Rights hardships like it has never been shown before. You feel Anne Moody's heart break and understand segregation how it really was in the deep south. HIGHLY recommended to anyone who wants to open their eyes to another cultural period and understand it for what it really was. It is real, heartbreaking, and impossible to put down."
5,Informative and to the point. Excellent book!!!,"This was one of the best books I have read in a while. I am from Woodville, MS and of the 'newer' generation. I felt like I was going back in time and I could imagine that she or some of the characters in her book once stood in the exact same place where I stand now. I can't help but feel a connection with the characters. I have a piece of them in me and it changes my perspective on the older community. It makes me see them as survivors who fought the war for me and the other 'new generations'. Thank you Ms. Moody!"
5,Spectacular,This was a great purchase. I recommend it to any one who would like to give it a read. I have relied on this book for a very long time.
1,The Enlightened One has spoken from on High.,"I have no idea what book the other reviewers were reading but it was not the same one I read. Anne Moody portrays herself as the only Enlightened person in the south at this time. She criticizes all whites for being racists and all blacks for being ""Uncle Toms"". Somehow I believe that this is the way she prefers to see her life and times rather than deal with the truth."
1,:::Yawn:::,"We read this book in school - Freshman Accel English. I can't say I'd ever recommend this to anyone, unless they were researching boring, straightforwward books lacking any eloquence or flavor. Moody tells her story without any emotion, which I guess is good because it isn't sappy, but it still manages to be asinine. If this book is being read to see the black viewpoint in the South, try something like Stuck Rubber Baby...Anything else really. Maybe I'm biased because I just didn't like how her Mom complained about being poor but squeezed out the kids at a rate of 1.5 per chapter. Sorry if this offends anyone, I know it isn't Moody's fault that her life was really boring, but I just wish stupid and poor people wouldn't have 10 kids when they can't afford to feed 2."
5,SNEAK PEAK!,"Anne Moody doesn't hold anything back in ""Coming of Age in Mississippi."" She really lets you into her reactions to the incredible events she went through in her life. From first discovering black/white seperation in public, to realizing that she could make a difference in the Civil Rights Movement, you will really get a first hand experience. I would definitely reccomend this book to anyone with an interest at all in the civil rights movement. Her descriptive rhetoric and detailed thoughts make the autobiography a joy to just sit and read. A+ Nathan Galaske"
4,Compelling Account of Growing Up in the South,"Anne Moody's account of her childhood and the enormous amount of racial hatred she encountered in the early part of her life is absolutely heart rending. Moody was one of the participants in the famous lunch counter sit-ins at Woolworth lunch counters in Mississippi. Moody's account of that day, as well as many others, sent a chill down my spine. This is truly an amazing account of racism and the struggle toward freedom."
4,"A ""MUST READ"" NOVEL FOR ALL STUDENTS","I was assigned to read this book over the summer for my tenth grade English class. I thought, ""Great!! Just another one of THOSE books!!"" My plan was to listen to an old Bob Dylan album and 'get the picture' about the Civil Rights Movement of the nineteen sixties. Well, I have since realized that the Movement was much more, or at least for a Negro woman from Mississippi named Anne Moody. I have lived in suburban New York my whole life and have not seen such severe racism as which Ms. Moody went through in the nineteen forties, fifties and sixties. Even though there are examples all around us, we choose to ignore them. This novel has taught me to open my eyes!! Ms. Moody's struggle to make America live up to its creed of ""all men are created equal"" is remarkably startling as it is the chilling truth."
5,Awesome book,This book was by far the best one I've read all year. I loved the story-telling approach she took to the book. It was an eye-opener to me how the blacks lived in so much fear of the whites. I loved how almost emotionless Moody was about writing the story. She really put the facts out there. I finished this 400-some page book in less than two days. Highly recommend!
4,Couldn't put it down,I found this book very honest & interesting. I gave it to a friend who said the same thing. I wish she had written more books.
5,Good,These gloves are exactly as described. I am very satisfied with this product and would purchase again if need be.
2,Might as well be disposable,These gloves feel good and work well but lasted me about 2 weeks before a seem popped in between the thumb and fore finger.I work for fedex and use them for handling packages and driving. C'mon they should last way longer than 2 weeks.The smith and wesson shooting gloves I have used in the past are much better. I wanted to try these because the pinky and ring fingers are full length and I only need the other 3 exposed to handle my scanning pad and paperwork.Disappointed because they are supposedly designed for carpenter's? Waste of money unless you are only going to model them.The YOUNGSTOWN KEVLAR gloves are much better but don't come in this open finger format.Also they make your hands sweat more that other materials I've used and make your hands stinky.
2,"Alright, but big thumb.","I got a pair of gloves that fit me fine for the most part, but the thumb is huge, both too long and far too broad. Very inconvenient"
5,soft yet so strong,these pair of gloves are made for the serious and novice carpenter alike. When you wear it you feel like a pro and find yourself eager to work more.Feeling the nails is a blessing in this style and sometimes you nee to be carefull when using a table saw.
1,Caution!!!!,"I got this for my husband so he could wear his dog tags on something nicer then the standard military issued necklace. Anyway, he wore it 2 weeks before the whole chain turned BLACK. It did not remain silver, and was not cheap for something that only lasted 2 weeks!!! Caution when buying."
2,Cheap clasps,Purchased two ball chains in different sizes and the clasp broke on both within a week.
2,not my ambient,"Do yourself a favor and listen to samples of most of the tracks before deciding whether to get this album. I didn't--I simply went on the word of a print reviewer who compared this to the ambient music of Brian Eno, one of my favorite artists. However, unlike Eno's soundscapes, most songs here have heavy beats with fast tempos and Cockney-accented lyrics. Not something I expected when I went to buy ""ambient"" music. Despite feeling misled, I gave this dub record a chance with a few listens and still find the music unoriginally repetitive and the lyrics trite, even silly. Like I said, it's not my ambient, but if you hang out in chill rooms at raves, it may be yours."
2,"Not bad, but....","This is a decent book on heraldry, but suffers from many of the problems that the ""classic"" works have- most notably, it's about one hundred years out of date. Additionally, it lacks the clarity and vigour found in classics such as Fox-Davies, and is rife with typographical errors (such as a shield clearly containing a bend being blazoned as having a chevron)."
4,A Nice Enjoyable Early-Relationship Movie,"I saw ""Cold Feet"" with Marissa Chibas and Griffin Dunne many years ago, and I had a fuzzy VHS copy for a while. This movie broke the mold because instead of following the legally-mandated meet-date-have sex rule of early-relationship movies and rom-coms, Griffin and Marissa spend 90% of the movie guardedly approaching each other, and their dates are about getting to know each other through shared experiences, not about tearing off each other's clothes in a sex-crazed panic and sucking lips like goldfish. Marissa is intensely cute and nervously charming, Griffin is at his nervous, ironic best, having just wrapped up his marriage to hippie-looney tunes wife Blance Baker (of ""16 Candles""). One of my favorite films is ""Sleepless in Seattle"", and this fits well in that style. For a realistic, romantic portrayal of normal people dating, I really liked ""Cold Feet"", and I'm very glad to discover I can order this through Amazon.Cold Feet"
5,Best Guide to Affirmations yet,"I cannot thank Yogananda enough for this booklet. It has changed my life.I started doing these to improve my tendency to worry and now I am a optimist. My thinking has changed my circumstances so much I cannot speak enough how important affirmations are. That said, he discusses faith, energy and how powerful the mind is. The book has affirmations for wealth, relationships, health, to have good reasoning, intuition, and to attract loving experiences daily. What more could you ask for?A brilliant book by a brilliant spiritual master who is direct, honest and writes well. If you want to change your thinking or stop the endless negative automatic thoughts you have, try this book and watch your thoughts change, your life improve and your happiness grow."
5,Very helpful and convenient!,I carry this little book with me at all times. As soon as I become aware of the chatter in my mind I whip out this little book to help me replace the mindless thoughts with loving healing affirmations.
5,Incredible book!,"Words are simply not enough to describe the experience of this book.From the third sentence I knew this was something I have wanted,looked for, been driven to find, for years. Stop reading my reviewand order the book!"
5,Positive Affirmations to read every day,This is a great little book that you can carry around with you and have a read whenever you have five minutes. I try to read a paragraph or two every day. Wonderful stuff to help keep you feeling positive and happy.
5,great read-- good shipping experience,"book received new, timely shipping.great read if anyone needs healing of any sort, health, success, relationships.It was and is helpful to me"
1,Rear wiper blade,The blade did not fit the Toyota 4Runner that I ordered it for. It was also shorter than 11 inches long.
2,Did not wipe over length of wiper...,Unlike the original wiper or the replacement purchased from my local dealer for my Infiniti SUV this wiper only touches my window over 80% of its length leaving the last two inches (the outside of the arc) not wiped at all. It actually makes a big difference in terms of visibility.
3,Holes Should Be Larger,"I realize that this mesh shaker is described as being small, which it is, but I found that the holes are too small for this shaker to be very functional. I feel that it would work better with fewer holes that are larger than the numerous ones that are quite small. For this reason alone, I find this product to be disappointing."
3,small but nice,I would have given this 5 stars for quality but saying that this is for cinnamon sugar is not even worth getting. I wanted it for powdered sugar and it is so small I would be filling it every few minutes for my baking. I would say it holds maybe a half cup if that and for regular sugar to come through the top there is no way. It is very fine. If you don't mind really small then that is fine go ahead and get it.
2,Transperant St. Lawrence,"This book is an amusing Whodunnit which will appeal largely to anyone who grew up in Northern New York or went to St. Lawrence University. Set at ""Charles University"" in the early eighties, the book appears to be a screed on the shortcomings of SLU, it's preppy, lily white students and the sterotype of averageness that too often pervades the college's reputation as safety school to the children of the well to do who couldn't get into MIddlebury or Williams.The author (it's a pseudonym} would appear to have been an English major. My guess is she likely got involved with one of her profesors to no good end (a common occurence at SLU in those days -- probably still for all I know.) The book is her revenge.If you didn't spend four years in the North Country, I wouldn't bother -- If you did, this will amuse or anger you (as you pick out the obvious references), depending on your view of SLU."
5,Mortgage your home to buy this book!,"I purchased this book for $50. After reading it, I believe it is priceless.Assagioli's older works on psychosynthesis are outstanding, but this one is sublime. This book is definitely a Masterwork of the Western Mystery Tradition.Page after page, Assagioli astounds you with insights gained over a lifetime of study. This man was a psychiatrist, but his true calling was as a spiritual adept. Don't read this book unless you are over 40. I would not have comprehended or appreciated this book at a younger age. I know this is a trite saying...but this book will change your life."
3,Good Stuff,"Another very fine album. I do however miss the the old style like Life As A Rodeo Man' Paint Me Back Home In Wyoming' Those were undoubtedly country western. With covers of Tom Cochrane songs, songs with Jon Bon Jovi, and songs written by Aerosmith, I just feel a little too much of the "" Little Long Haired Outlaw"" is showing his face. This cowboy doesn't like that much rock 'n' roll. Don't get me wrong, this album is still in rotation in my CD changer, but the other four are the old Chris LeDoux, and in the tape deck are two Chris LeDoux albums still on The Lucky Man Music recording Label. Two thumbs up Chris but I miss Bareback Jack and Strawberry Roan."
3,"Solid, Raw Ledoux sound and vocals, missing cowboy style.","One Road Man provides classic songs redone with Ledoux's genuine sound, but I miss the flavor of songs written by Ledoux himself. Bang A Drum, Life is a Highway, and Caballo Diablo are winners."
5,It's just THAT good ...,"Chris LeDoux has done it again and proved his versatility in song styles. From ""Old Paint"" to ""The Fever"" every song on this album is done up in classic LeDoux style. It may just be his best yet ... but with a singer as talented as Chris, it just gets better and better. If you buy only one CD this year, make it this one! I come from a ranching background, and Chris sings it like it is. He IS country, from ranching to rodeo, he's lived it, and as a result, he is able to put more into his songs than just incredibly vocal talent ... with every word, you can hear the heart and soul behind the music. Chris LeDoux is what every ""country singer"" should strive to be!"
4,He keeps getting farther away .,"It is like he left the good old country an went to the dammed old rock an roll . I wish he would go back to the country, just like one of the other guys said. But he is still the best there is. He was the world champion BAREBACK rider in 1964 , so he has been there."
5,One of chris's greatest cd's to date,"Chris LeDoux had done it again with his newest album One road man not only does it include some great covers from Garth Brooks, Charlie Daniels, and Tom Cockrane, it also has some great duets with Jon bon Jovi and Charlie Daniels, and also includes some rocking love songs Runaway love and One tonight, and a nice romance sone one road man, this is a must for any Diehard country or Chris LeDoux fan"
5,Another great C. Ledoux album!!!!!!,"I just picked up the recent release by chris ledoux ""One Road Man"", and the CD is in my opinion the best music Mr. Ledoux has put out, I especially love his version of Bang a Drum (w/Jon Bon Jovi), this man was an awesome rodeo man and an equal musician. This CD is a must have for any Chris Ledoux fan...."
4,"Very,very good, but miss the old Chris LeDoux","Chris is my favorite singer and I like this CD a lot; the more I play it the more I like it. But I miss the old Chris LeDoux, singing about rodeo and the West. A lot of the songs on his last few CD's could have been sung by any country singer--especially the love songs. Don't get me wrong: Chris is the best, I have all his CD's and tapes,I've seen him in concert, and I love anything he puts out. I just want more of what made him my favorite: rodeo and Western songs."
5,Rock with some real thought behind it.,"Blake Morgan's Band is a staple in the NY clubs. He has a large following and his work only gets better. You can play this CD on your CD-Rom and get visuals on-screen while you listen. Great CD; it rocks. Morgan's also an amazing outfielder, often found in New York's Central Park. Talk about multi-talented!"
2,Poorly laid out Book Complicates the Uncomplicated,"This book should not be used for learning mathematical modeling. It serves very poorly as a textbook for several reasons: the author offers convoluted explanations that other authors are able to provide succinctly, the author does not illustrate examples with explanations of how concepts are being used, theorems are embedded within the text, the text jumps around without a reasonable flow. Overall, it is as if you are reading a series of typewritten notes from a 1990's lecturer who has difficulty conveying meaning."
4,I like this book,"This is a good textbook for mathematical finance. Surely, it is neither the first book nor the last you should resort to. It shows some mathematical technicalities but limited, which I think of as an advantage. After finishing a first book with intuitive illustrations, you can consult this book before digging into a book making you totally lost.It's comprehensive for upper undergraduate or first year graduate study.I did not use it for introduction, but it did make some blurs conceptually clear to me. I recommend it."
5,Lucid!,"Excellent, highly readable, solid and intuitive. Lucid on all aspects of Math Finance, with both Econ and Math theory in mind. This can be a good replacement for Hull. Not as well known, but I think this is an extended version of Financial Calculus by Baxter and Rennie"
3,Good,"It's a basic introduction to the financial market including options, futures and the pricing. I think it is useful."
4,Excellent for beginners: children thru adult!,This video is an excellent way to learn or review tap dancing.The instructor moves slowly and teaches the steps as well as the proper names of steps. She quickly has you speeding up. I'm 33 years old and have never taken a dance class before. This video was easy to follow and a lot of FUN! The only minus is that it is only about 30 minutes long (I wish it was longer)!
2,More Exhibition Than instruction,"What is wrong with this video:1)Miss Christy is in dire need of a hair band. She fiddles with her hair to DISTRACTION.2) The video is annoying because it is not a mirror representation of the steps. Meaning... when she says start on the right foot she ALSO starts on the right foot. To the viewer it looks like the LEFT foot. When you are trying to follow along and make sure you have the changes right this little flaw becomes very obvious and impedes learning. You COULD start out on the left foot, but that goes against the real world.3) The tape is too short and there is next to NO warm up.4) The children in the video are either well beyond the tape's skills and seem to want to show off or they are tots that lack coordination. Nowhere in between. For adult, the way she talks can be grating and condescending. This is the least of the tapes problems and I mention it only in a passing way.This is a waste of money."
4,Tap Class,"This video was a little too advanced for my granddaughter (age 4), but it wouild be TERRIFIC for ages 6 and up. Good investment."
3,"Newman's Own Organics Prunes, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",Not bad.Have had better...I did find these to be moist enough to rate it 3 stars...Moistness in packaged prunes is a priority to me.Nice an sweet. About average size whole dried plums.Must refrigerate after opening which it tells you on the package.I think I got a fair price for what I got.
2,not so great - newman's mediocre again in my opinion,"I'm thrilled that they were organic, but they were dry and not as flavorful as they should be.I think the product quality is lacking.Disappointed."
1,Nice Try...But...,"Nice try...but this one fails on most counts. There's nothing ""Bloody Disgusting"" about it other than the cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and storyline. The acting is non-existent. So far, I've seen all but two of the Bloody Disgusting collection films. Only ""Yellowbrick Road"" lived up to the promo...so far. What bothered me most was how S-L-O-W thisk moved along. In fact, it didn't move along at all. With a nickel and dime budget, I recommend you avoid this unless it's the only movie available and you have a couple of hours to waste."
1,this one is a stinker.,this movie is good to get that sunday afternoon nap going. i find anything more than one star suspect. sometimes reviews get pumped by people with a financial interest or maybe friends involved in the movie. do not get suckered into paying anything for this one. it is really bad.
1,What a pointless film - very disappointing,"I read the only other review with the rater giving it 4 Stars - honestly if there was a zero star rating this would be a candidate - the plot is boring, the effects are minimal and crude (why that would be a plus is beyond me) - that the film was made with very little budget definitely shows, as does the lack of talent for direction and acting - this movie was truly a total waste of time. I agree the heavy-metal industrial soundtrack is over-powering to the point of giving me a headache and really does not offer anything related to what is going on - as far as action - was none - other than pooping and puking thru a tube if that is action?"
3,Dave in Kazoo,The book would be good for someone new to computer repair. I bought it to keep current on new technology. There was little new in it.
4,GOOD ILLUSTRATION,This book will present you with the basics of computers and ever more techie stuff. The important thing more than just an actual book is hands-on learning.The publishers can improve this book by using colors and bigger font letters.
5,A Good Guide,"As one who watched his own father, a retired minister, die a horrible, lingering death this past year after 15-year battles with cancer, heart disease and diabetes, I found Mr. Price's ""Letter"" to be both thought-provoking and helpful in my own search for answers to the questions posed in the book's title -- more helpful than my re-readings of Ecclesiastes and Job were.No one in this life, however faithful, can be absolutely sure that he has THE answers. All anyone can truly have is a good guess about directions in which to look for those answers. I have found Mr. Price to be a good guide partly because he has traveled farther down that solitary road than most of us and has come back with the willingness to report his findings in the clearest voice that anyone can have under such circumstances."
2,Lost before.....Lost after,"As a person that has experienced personal tragedy recently, I began a search for answers on not the existence of God, but the question of ""does he really care"". I thought this book could provide some insight into answers to that very question. It only left me more puzzled. Mr. Price raised several questions as to the existence of God and whether he cares, but never came to much of a conclusion. If you are looking for a book to generate thought provoking questions concerning faith, this is the book for you. If you are looking for advise and answers, don't bother."
3,Thought provoking,"This book is very thought provoking. It is more like a philosophy text than a story though, so I only gave it 3 stars. It's a fairly fast read, and the prose is interesting. I had read another book from this author, and this author consistantly puts out good works. A good pool side read."
4,This what REAL hiphop is all about,"This cd is full of super jazzy cuts and fun well thought out rhymes. For people who love De la Soul's middle years, The Roots and Slum village, this album will fit in neatly."
2,HaHa I fell for this years ago ...,"It's so funny to look back at myself at the age of 20 and see my self wearing not 1 but 2 of these worthless items. Well, Now I'm 32 Years old and I can now laugh at how I really believed a smartly designed piece of tin (No Magnets) could give me extra strength. I have no faith or belief in Magnetic therapy. It's a catchy gimmick and that's all it will ever be. If you're into this type of stuff and you just want to blow away some cash get the Iron Man Mark VII magnetic bracelets (Yeah from the Avengers movie) At least with that you'll have a cool conversation piece but please don't put much stock in the Magnetic therapy part. Thanks for your time and I hope this has been helpful as well as a good laugh.Trion:Z Legend Bracelet (Carbon Fiber/Titanium)"
5,Amazing poetry by an amazing man!,"This book was very special for me to read because Mike was such a special guy. Wherever Mike went, he made people smile with his warmth and humor. Before Mike went to be with the Lord in 2003, he wrote many poems.This book is a wonderful collection of his poems and they cover a wide range of emotions. You may laugh, smile, cry, and reflect as you read these poems. You will love this book!"

4,Cute,"I think this movie is cute. Kinda creepy for little kids i think, but all in all cute. Its great to get out and watch around Christmas. Jim Carey does a good job."
5,Classic fav,Classic Christmas movie. It is my grandchildren'sa favorite!!Heartwarming and colorful and it is good to watch all year long!
3,a very basic book,"This is a very basic book but a good intro to hummingbird gardening. It recommends non-native plants in addition to native ones but you have to do your own research to determine which are which. By the time I bought this book I already knew what they hadto say and was well past it. Its very very basic - has lists of plants and drawings of gardens but doesn't tell much more. Common sense tells you that hummingbirds like flowers that are trumpt shaped and red. Other books can tell you more about the plants and its better to plant native plants anyway since they are ""designed"" to grow in your area and their blossoms are timed with the hummingbird migration (its the whole interdependency/web of life thing)."
2,"nice concept, but more of a pamphlet than a book","This is a tiny book, more of a children's book than a resource for serious gardeners. It's attractively designed and laid out, but the informational content is limited. The information on selecting plants for a hummingbird garden is not entirely accurate -- for example, wooly blue curls (trichostema lanatum) are actually not ""well-adapted to various soil types"". Unfortunately that's almost all the book had to say about this beautiful but temperamental western native, which requires especially well-drained soil.Part of the problem is that this book doesn't address regional differences. Perhaps it would be suitable for residents of the east coast or Midwest. For residents of western states, I would recommend looking elsewhere, such as books on native plants or the Sunset guide to Western Gardens."
4,its about hummies and their gardens,"Nicely done book on how to set up and make your yard and gardens ripe for bringinghummies to your house and gardens. Helpful hints, good pictures or where andhow to set up and much more. After looking over some of the info in the book, Ishifted my hummingbird feeders to the back porch. I got more hummies to stop and wasable to photograph more of them too."
5,"Great book, fine service.",We need more peace at all levels. Less of the male response to stress: fight or flight; more of the feminine response: tend and befriend.
5,This soundtrack includes classic songs from the movie.,I just love Labrynth. These songs remind me of how great this movie is. It brings back the good memories of my childhood. I just love it!
4,Great - with only a little wincing from David Bowie,"I loved this movie. I agree with the poster below; this type of fantasy touches something in women. We love this magic-guy-in-love-with-the-real-world-heroine story. The music is haunting, mystical, sometimes silly (The Goblin Battle), and altogether wonderful. Two of David Bowie's songs - ""Chilly Down"" and ""Magic Dance"" made me rate this four stars because I truly do not care for these two tunes. The rest, however, paints a perfect picture of fantasy, especially the lovely ""Sarah"" the almost heartbreaking ""Home at Last,"" and the whole reason for buying the soundtrack, the stellar ""As The World Falls Down."" All in all, a damn good album."
5,A most amazing experience!,"'Allo! If you've seen the movie and love that little worm as much as I do, buy the soundtrack! I've loved this movie from the very first time I saw the commercial, yes, I was one of the unfortunate who didn't see it until it came on TV. My very, very favorite song is ""Home at Last"" because I love sad music, and that is just beautiful. I also love ""Sarah"" and the ""opening titles"". I'm one who's not really into dancing though, but whenever ""Magic Dance"" or ""Chilly Down"" comes on, I'm glad I'm not in public or I would embarass myself! HA! ""As the World Falls Down"" has always been one of my favorites, but ""Home at Last"", though instrumental, has to be my alltime favorite song. I love absolutely everything about this soundtrack, every song, every melody. Just get it ok! =0)"
5,You CAN'T go wrong with this one!,"A magical soundtrack for a magical movie. It's like taking the movie with you wherever you go. The songs are fantastic! Bowie is fantastic! There's no way you can go wrong with this one. Now, if only some body would start printing the movie again!"
4,"Good Soundtrack, but only if you LOVE the movie!","I enjoyed this soundtrack, but I love this movie also! Anybody that doesn't like the movie is more than likely not going to like this."
5,there's so much i felt i should say...,"...prior to the last review that i read about labyrinth,i would have to agree with all apart from the how it's onlyfor senorita's to like, i'm a guy and this movie and soundtrackboth dus me well ;) great Movie with many fantastic momentsand a really beautiful soundtrack, Well worthy to be in anyones c/d collection.As the World falls down and Magic Dance arr my fav songs :0"
4,Great 80's music from a fun 80's movie,"David Bowie's soundtrack from the movie is pretty much what you expect: if you've seen the movie Labyrinth, you've heard the soundtrack. As a longtime fan of the film and an unabashed child of the '80's, I still enjoy it. I only wish they'd included a lyrics sheet."
5,The Labyrinth,"This is one of the best soundtracks that I have heard. It truly follows the movie closely. I can hear a song and know extactly what scene is being played. If you have ever seen this movie, then you will know what I am talking about. Their are several songs on this cd that are so beatiful. Of course, the entire cd is beautiful, but here are the songs that I think people will recognize the most: As The World Falls Down, Magic Dance, Thirteen O'Clock, Chilly Down, and Within You. As The World Falls Down, Thirteen O'Clock, and Within You are lovely, huanting melodies, while Magic Dance and Chilly Down are upbeat, move your feet tunes. This is even a cd that you want mind playing around your children."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"There`s not much to say... If you have seen the movie, BUY the Soundtrack!! If you haven`t seen the movie, BUY IT ANYWAY! This CD is fantastic. After my opinion David Bowie`s best collection EVER! Listen to this CD longer that 10 minutes, and the songs are sticked into your brain FOREVER!"
5,He didn't sell out here!!!,"David Bowie complains that he sold out in the eighties. This soundtrack would seem to prove him wrong. His music is so unique and enjoyable, and Trevor Jones' score complements Bowie's musical and acting performance perfectly. ""Magic Dance"" is one of the best tracks on the album. the movie was incredible, and this soundtrack is right up there with Legend, Dune, & Blade Runner."
5,Labyrinth is true magic,"Most reviews of David Bowie's life erroneously leave out his wonderful work in film--such as ""Labyrinth"" and ""The Hunger."" Bowie lends an air of true magic to ""Labyrinth"", both with his screen presence and with his music and haunting voice. He is a genius, in the real sense of the word. Anyone captured by this movie/soundtrack once will never be the same."
3,Labyrinth...downsized,"I was a little disappointed when I listened to this soundtrack. I absolutely love the ballroom song, ""As the World Falls Down,"" but the one on the soundtrack is different than the one on the movie. It's faster and more keyboardy. I liked the movie one better. The ""Magic Dance"" song is different on the soundtrack also. David Bowie makes the baby sounds and it sounds really [not real]. The backup singers sound bad too.The rest of the songs were pretty good though--especially ""Underground.""I have to keep reminding myself that these are songs from the 80's and they are a little different from what I remember them to be when I saw this movie when I was about 6. The smart thing the producers did with this movie was have David Bowie star in it. I would otherwise not be a David Bowie fan."
5,Nothing better then the best; Labyrinth,"Labyrinth is a well performed movie, and well written. Jennifer Connelly did a spectacular job on her character! David Bowie couldn't have done any better. His music was phenominal, for lack of a better word, not to mention his acting. The entire cast did a spectacular job. The plot is great, and as said before, very well written. The music, was outstanding and should have won millions of gramys and awards. As the movie went on, it captavated any one lucky enough to view it. The art was amazing. My hats of the Jim Henson. I can not stress the effectivness of the music. Bully for David Bowie and Terry Jones. The music added so much to the movie, and would not be as great as it is, without it. I would strongly recomend anyone going out and seeing it. It is the best movie of all time."
4,Bowie's tracks stand out the most!,"There's no doubt in anyone's mind, once they hear the soundtrack that Bowie hold it together. The songs are very clever. Especially for Bowie, whom prior to the Labyrinth soundtrack, had little to no experience writing songs about a children's' movie. ""Magic Dance"" is a funny song, but nonetheless good in it's strange and simple way. ""Underground"" is a weird song, but much better than any non-Bowie track included on the soundtrack. My absolute favorite song on the soundtrack, hands down, has to be ""As The World Falls Down."" This is a love song at its best! Bowie's voice is stronger than ever, along with his song writing! I can't get enough of this song, and hope you won't be able to too! Many critics ponder on why Bowie chose to do this movie. It's quite simple really. Bowie has always searched high and low for something that would make people talk. Labyrinth was the perfect solution."
5,Labyrinth,This is an awesome soundtrack. It is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
1,music,"this was not for me but a gift , never heard from the granddaughter so I don't know how she liked , but guess she did since she had asked specifically for it."
3,Only 1 thing wrong!,I bought as a gift for my lady. We both love Labyrinth. I wouldn't have thought the cd to be censored but our favorite song is. Its SLAP THAT BABY MAKE HIM PEE not FREE. Other than that its all good
5,It's Only Forever,"The first time I saw The Labyrinth I was 7 or 8, probably 1987/88 Rotterdan, on tv and it really blew me away. It has a fairytale quality, a beautiful world of make-believe, truly wonderful. Years later, 2006 I went to the local fantasy shop (which has unfortunately moved from Rotterdam to Delft), saw the special DVD box with special drawing cards inside and bought it then and there. In that very same year I also bought the soundtrack.While the ""Opening Title"" transports you to The Labyrinth, ""Into The Labyrinth"" makes you want to walk inside and be lost forever.""As the World falls down"" and ""Within You"" are both beautiful and haunting, showing Jareth's desperation and (maybe) love for Sarah.""The Gobling Battle"" is a blast, ""Home at last"" makes one feels like it is a preparation for the BIG Party in ""Underground""."
5,Labyrinth Sountrack,Loved the movie as a kid. My kids love the songs and are original songs from the movie.
4,Listen to it all the time,"The first time I watched the movie, I fell in love with the songs. I memorized it. It took me years to find the soundtrack, so when I did, I bought it. It's nice to listen to all of the songs that were in the movie in full version, it takes me back to when I first watched the movie."
3,Why the rejected version of Dance Magic?,"They used the rejected version of Dance Magic, wich can be seen as an extra in the DVD release. After hearing it, I can understand why they opted not to use it in the movie. It would have been nice if they'd added BOTH versions of the song on the disc, seeing as it has few songtracks & has both versions of Underground. To this day, aside from maybe 3 other songs he sang in the early 80s, this is the best music I've ever heard from David Bowie. (Does his face age at all? He looks just as young today.....)"
5,"Pricey, but it sticks to glass in extreme temperatures","This was $75 for the package when I ordered it, which is expensive compared to other ""re-closeable fasteners"". What sets this apart, though, is that it does live up to its claim to be high temperature. I used this product to fasten a set of emergency response lights to my windshield. Other fasteners I tried came loose within days in the summer. This fastener has been in place for over two years now with no issues. The price is also offset by you not having to use very much to accomplish the job. My Whelen SlimMiser light is held to my windshield with just 3 square inches of the product. Overall, pricey but worth it."
1,Not worth the money!,"After using this I would have to agree with other reviews, look at something else. The problem with this strap is that the quick release buckles slip apart when you try to get it on tight, which I want when I'm traveling with my car. Other than that the straps are ok, but that for it's intended purpose makes them sub par."
4,Long but serves its purpose,"These straps work just fine for me. The only complaint I have is based on the picture, the strap looks rather short, for the use intended. However in reality the strap is extremely long, leaving a ton of slack i have to wrap all around my bike."
1,Would not hold,I returned this because it wouldn't hold. No matter how I routed the strap it slipped very easily. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,Meh,"These do the job, but they are REALLY long, meaning loose straps, and nothing special in terms of the clasp design."
2,Kind of cheap,Purchased the straps to keep the tire from flopping around. I guess it will do that but I am afraid to use the strap because it is so ruff that it will scratch the paint on the frame.
5,Fundamental Forerunners,"From Scott Joplin's rag, to Charlie Parker's & Miles Davis's beatnik cool, Disc 1 features pieces from some of the greatest innovators of jazz. Disc 2 illustrates the influence these fathers of jazz had on seminal artists of the 70s & 80s. After getting to know the pieces on this collection, you will easily recognize the role these artists continue to play in today's music--not just jazz, but in a wide range of genres.Fans of roots music will also enjoy NPR's ""American Routes"" weekly program. Visit [...] for broadcast times on your local PR station."
3,Mid-life Crisis?,"Yeah, I'm in a bit of a retro mood at the minute (trying to relive my youth or something). So I dug out this little record.Now the Atom Seed were a band I followed in the late eighties, & had a funky rock style, if you're into the Chilli Peppers(they supported them when the peppers toured the UK)you should check this out.I think they ware their influences on their sleeves abit wit this debut, but would have evolved into something special have they been given a chance to make a second album (they were dropped after their first album, the bass player went on to join Bruce Dickinson's solo band)They were a nice band, who really went against the grain with their music, so defiantly worth a spin"
5,Great condition. You wouldn't think it was as old as it is.,The book was in fantastic condition and the story is just as lovely as I remember it from when I was a little girl.
5,Great Children's Book,"I still have my large copy from childhood. How sad that what I received was a smaller version. The story, however, is still large! This is a wonderful tale of how much one receives when one gives selflessly. It should be reissued in the original large size."
2,Charming but blurry!,This is a charming story and the illustrations are painstakingly detailed but VERY blurry. Maybe this latest edition had a different printing process or something. The story is lovely but if the drawings in Corgiville Fair are a 10 these blurry pictures would rank a 3. What a disappointment! As a big Tasha Tudor fan I am dismayed that the producers of the book would put it out in such a state that I would have rate it so poorly.
5,Corgiville Christmas is another winner.,Tasha Tudor has another winner with Corgiville Christmas - I have all her books - I collect children's books (waiting for those grandkids) and the Corgiville series is fantastic. The story is fun and the illustrations are amazing. I recommend all of her books for your collections.
1,Drawings are very blurry,"I like the story, and the book but the illustrations are terrible. It looks like they did not line up the plates correctly and the drawings are blurry. Do not recommend for this price."
3,Could have been lovely!,"I am a fan of Tasha Tudor children's books, collected them for my children and purchased this for my grandchild. So disappointed in the very poor quality of print! Overall extremely blurred. The illustrations are nearly indecipherable. I think I noticed that it was printed in China. Whoever is in charge of Tasha Tudor's works, should make an effort to maintain the integrity and quality of her work."
3,GOOD HISTORY,"I ENJOYED READING THE BOOK, AND RECCCOMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS READING REAL HISTORY. PROVIDES A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE/ACCOUNT OF PHILADELPHIA, AND THE REACTION TO A PROBLEM THAT REACHES INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE CULTURE.MANY GREAT PEOPLE STRUGGLED TO GET PHILADELPHIA THROUGH THESE DAYS!"
1,Incorrect/misleading information,"The title and associated information for this book titled ""Scoring High on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills - Itbs, Book 1"" is misleading. I interpreted it as a test preparatory aid for my child that would include practice questions and excersises to help improve test scores. However, it turns out to be just a test booklet that you would get for an actual test sans the test questions! This information should have been clearly associated with the book. And what would have been really helpful is to include information about the questions' booklet so one can actually be able to take the practice tests!"
1,The Other Half of Christmas?,"Hey guys, don't waste your time ordering this item from Amazon. I bought this item at a great price just as they were being marked down (waited for two years for the price to come down). Albeit Barcana makes a great product, Amazon can only seem to be able to deliver half a tree (ships in two boxes due to size/weight). I called customer service and the nice gentleman courteously explained that he would re-submit my order, and sure enough another box arrives with half a tree. Seems logical that I would be content now, but all I have is the bottom half of two expensive trees without a stand or the top. Called customer service again and they gave me a refund. Customer service was really courteous, but the guys in the warehouse see a product number on a box and send it.... Somewhere in the Amazon inventory they have a stack of tree tops awaiting a great family Christmas."
1,Wishing for a complete tree...Need box 2 of 2!,"Same story as the other individuals. Purchased this tree with the logic that Amazon could not possibly continue such an obvious error. I was wrong. We received box 1 of 2 of what appears to be a beautiful tree. Called customer service and they offered no solution to the problem other than a refund. I didn't want a refund, I wanted the complete tree. Don't list an item if you are not prepared to sell it. Offering a refund, while the easy solution, is not acceptable. It is beyond me how this happened, and frustrating that Amazon showed no willingness to find box 2 of 2 for me. It has to be there somewhere."
4,The Ending Was Messed up!!!,"I usually don't write reviews but I was so pissed off that I had to do it. You just always root for a hero and a villain. You're hoping that the story will end the way you want it to. But int his case, it didn't & i was just upset about that. Ok, I'm done!!"
1,Do I Have To Give It Any Stars?,"This movie was awful. I understand that the writer and director of this film seem like they are sincere people, but jeez there are so many things wrong with this movie from the EPIC SLOW pacing to the characters, I really can't begin to take the time to name them all. Do NOT WATCH this film. I watched it FOR FREE on showtime & I was still ticked off."
3,Everyday Deception,"The cover of this DVD is quite deceiving. This is not a love story between a young black man and black woman. It is about a middle aged black man who is living a lie. He conceals the fact that he is the father of a young woman that frequents his store. His business is also slowing slipping out his hands due to his financial distress. A young Muslim brother, played by the enticing Omari Hardwick decides he wants to give the older man's business some financial support. As soon as Hardwick enters the screen you begin to sense that he is too good to be true. His motives become clear as he strong arms the shopkeeper and deceives his daughter into thinking he is upstanding. I enjoyed the movie but I am longing for a film that expresses the pure love between a black man and a black woman. One that tackles the ups and downs involved in two people deciding to take a journey together. It has been way too long since Love Jones was released."
3,This is a good movie,"This is a very good movie. Judgiing by the cover I also thought it was going to be a love story but I was wrong. Despite that this movie was awesome, it kept me entertained and interested from the beginning to the end."
1,ALL AMAZON DVDs,"I have not been able to play this movie. However, all Amazon DVDs I have bought in the past, my CD player cannot read. I have no problem reading any other CDs."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"Although I am a fan of Omari Hardwick, the role of Malik just did not work. Henry Brown, as Moses, did an excellent job! He was one of the few hopes within the community, and killing Moses at the end of the movie killed hope. Also, killing off the character (Sonny), which Corey Jackson played, was senseless. I was very disappointed with the outcome of this movie, and I will not be watching it again."
2,Not Love Story It's Drama! Sorry!,"The actors in this movie they're great, but the movie is sorry and about drug dealing on the street in this story. Sorry! I hate the end of this movie, People save your money."
2,Everyday I waste money,Borrow it from someone and save your money. The movie was good for eye candy only and maybe one or two chuckles.
2,Everyday Black Man,"In an interest to follow the career of the OLD SPICE MAN. I choose this movie. It was interesting and I did enjoy watching it. I think I will more use it to compare his acting progress as he continues to move up in his acting career. That was the reason for my purchase as well as the reason to watch it more times. All and all though, it was a pretty good film for a one time watch."
4,Be careful who you trust,"I liked it, I wanted her to know him as her father longer before he died. We are assuming he died."
5,Everyday BlackMan,I just saw Everyday black man and it is a great movie im personally recommondating and encouage people to see it this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I give it five stars.
4,it was pretty good considering everything,It was not long enough to me!! I did enjoy it and Omari is always nice to look at. lol. He was just too nice and thought provoking. Of course he had something up his sleeve and what he did to Sonny..was WRONG
3,everday black man,"this movie was okay, i enjoyed it, it was on that gave u a little of both worlds, yes, when see this movie we think it a love story but it not, overall it a good movie to watch and relax to"
4,Good Entertainment,Entertaining movie. Story was slightly predictable but interesting none the less. It is a very good movie for young ladies as a reinforcement on the perils of jumping into relationships and not listening to people who have loved you for years. I would recommend it for its good entertainment value.
4,riddler's moon,"I saw Riddler's Moon as a teenager on tv and I was very excited to be able to buy it. I haven't watched Battle Planet yet, but it seems like an interesting show to watch.I am a Kate Mulgrew fan and it's awesome to see her in a more feminine, less commanding and more vulnerable role."
1,Product never arrives,"I ordered a set of Auto ventshade in Sept. 2009 but never received the product. In fact, I forgot about it until I received the invitation email for reviewing the product!What has happened to my order?Please send the product so that I can review.Thanks"
1,Yikes!!!!!!,She has one of the most Amazing Careers thus far&I'm Scurred about it.alot of Success&whatnot&I still can't beleive it.some of the music tracks are alright on her Stuff&She is Eye-Candy for Real but as a Artist&all this Princess of Hip-Hop Soul Mess it's Laughable to me.She reminds me of Janet Jackson before She hooked up with Jimmy Jam&Terry Lewis&Janet then was kinda wack to me.but then again Janet then was still better than Ashanti.
5,excellent combo,"This is a nicely built keyboard with very good tactile feedback on the keys. I came off of a split keyboard, so I was worried that I would dislike it, but surprisingly it's been pretty good, so far. I like the low-profile design a lot.The Home/End/etc keys different design takes a lot of getting used to, but once I did, I really like it (their positions actually makes sense, and double-sized delete is pretty nice).Wireless response is great from all over my room. I think that I might notice a lag between the pressing of the key and the appearance of it on the screen, but I don't type fast enough to be distracting or annoying.I don't use the mouse because I have an MX1000 already, so I can't comment on it.I must say that Logitech continues to create very quality computer peripherals. Highly recommended."
4,Very comfortable keyboard - Worth the buy!,I dont know what is David Hutchison is complaining about the keyboard size. To be realistic anything bigger than this keyboard keys is an old type computer and i dont know how you could fit it to keyboard trays. For me size of the keys are perfect. One bad thing about the keyboard is the Caps Lock and Function lock indicators are not on the keyboard but instead on the IR Receiver station. And hence mouse dont have a docking station for recharging. Quite acceptable due to lower series compared to LX 700. Overall keyboard is very nicely build and as always superb 0 degrees tilt. This set is worth buying at $30.00. I'll recommend this to typical computer users.
3,No simultaneous use,"I bought this keyboard & mouse set for work on the Black Friday sales. I mainly bought it because I had limited mouse mobility at work. This set is good for the price, but I found that I can't use shortcut keys on the keyboard unless I stop moving the mouse. So I need to make sure I let go of the mouse to make sure it's not moving, and that's when I can use Ctrl+A,V,C,X shortcuts."
5,Cordless keyboard LX500,I had worried about mouse response time as well as battery lasting time in placing an order on this item.But quite satisfied with both on my worries.Greater keyboard with mouse than what I have ever used.I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
2,The keys are tiny!,First of all please check out the pics I posted of this keyboard - the keys are as small those on my notebook! I don't care if this keyboard has a key for everything possible use - which it does - if I can't type properly its worthless. I don't know if the overall size of the keyboard is too small or if the problem is the surface area of the keys - I just don't like it.
3,Just OK,"Had his for some months now, use it infrequently. It seems solid and powerful enough, but one is reminded of why it is less costly than some of its competitors with similar basic specs: balance. This has the feel of a cheap Chinese-made product and not a fine German engineered device. It's somewhat loud (sounds like a DC-3 landing when it shuts down) and has very unbalanced wheels. It's heavy enough that it doesn't vibrate too much, but there is certainly a bit of shimmy in it. Better griding wheels may remedy this. Fine for basic homeowner use."
3,Distracting Format,"While the author may know a considerable amount about academic publishing, the book's format -- composed of a fictional series of letters to authors who've supposedly committed mistakes in the publishing process or who've supposedly asked questions they want answered -- is distracting and keeps the author from addressing his subject in an in-depth, serious way. William Germano's book, Getting It Published, covers this subject in a more comprehensive, more easily accessible form."
1,Poor Customer Service Makes This Sealer Useless,"We recommended a Rival food sealer to many friends and relatives, before it developed a glitch. After a short time, the sealer started turning off before the food saver bags were fully suctioned. It was necessary to unplug it and plug it back in to get it going again. As time went on, the problem became worse and worse. After receiving no replies to our contacts to Rival (2 to the 800 number and 1 via email), we tossed it and replaced it with another, more expensive brand. Rival's customer service is non-existent, so do not take a chance with buying any of their products. If it should break, you are on your own."
2,mediocre,"not impressed. i've sealed five things so far, and two i've had to reseal because the machine woulnd't seal them. i am saving small portions,so i'm trying to cut down the large bags, but i can't get the machine to seal them. also, supposedly, it's supposed to go to hands free after a bit, but it only did it twice of the five (well, actually seven if you include the resealing) times."
3,Not Purchased,Seller informed me prior to shipping that there were missing parts which could not be replaced. Declined to purchase & money was refunded.
4,CUTE!,"My 22-month-old daughter loves this doll. It's very cute and well-made, especially given the price, and it's a nice size, easy for little arms to carry. I recommend it."
2,its eh,"It shaved...but not well. Fromm is supposed to be good. But the shavette was just too light and that razor including the Fromm packs werent that sharp. It caused an insane level of irritation. I use real straights and wanted to use this as a travel version...not worth it. It's very hard to get a good shave with this. If you're looking to start into straight shaving, just go on badger and blade and get info and help there. Then buy a real straight."
5,Magnificent CD,Tarika Blue has created fabulous music. It is unfortunate that they seem to have only 3 CD's.
2,Key holder,I would not buy again...but I kept it instead of having the hassel of returning.It is much smaller than you think. You can't hang a ring of keys on one peg...only one or maybe two will fit. They are hard to get off the peg and if its too full the door won't close.
3,Good Enough,"Not bad, not brilliant. Each post can only hold one or at most two keys, so it's not ideal for storing groups of keys, as city-dwellers might prefer."
5,Awesome Instrumental Worship.,"I love this Instrumental worship by Ruth Fazal.I listen to this music many times, and praying.It's Awesome Album from Ruth Fazal =)Highly Recommend to any body."
3,Ok,This was a pretty good book. It had action and suspense. I love the Intrigue books because I like to have the romance as well as the action part of the books. It makes it that much more gripping for the reader
2,Would be better if there were words.,"The CD's play fine, but it's hard to sing along when there aren't any words to sing along with for my kids. They're sad, so am I. I wish I would have just bought the MP3 for a dollar."
2,Just not worth it,"While it looked cute and seemed like a good cat toy, Carl just wasn't into it and it wasn't worth the few bucks that it cost. Oh well."
1,USELESS for puppies,Absolutely useless !! My 3 month old lab puppy chewed it in the very first minute. I threw the rest in next minute.
5,We had to buy another one because all of my cats wanted to play with it!,"We have 4 cats, 2 of which love toys and 2 usually don't enjoy any cat toys. We brought this mouse ball home and all 4 were interested. It seems to be weighted a bit and surprisingly our cats liked that feature. The weight makes the ball move in unusual ways, instead of straight all the time. I couldn't smell the catnip on the toy, but it appears the cats could. They batted it around for quite a long time. The tail is fur and that's what our cats grabbed on to while walking with it to another room. We had to buy another one to keep the cat crew happy! I know for a fact every cat has a unique toy preference, but this one was a hit in our house!"
2,Mediocre toy,"This ball had no ""catnip"" smell as was claimed on the packaging. Instead it had a plastic/rubber smell and has been mostly ignored by my cat. I'm currently ""marinating"" the ball in a catnip container to try and get her more interested."
1,Correct Detail's Please,"The dimentions given in the Product Description are for the outside of the case including the Base, my bobbleheads would not fit. I feel that I wasted my time."
4,"I liked this because is was melow, interesting.",There is little difference between this melow music and the type of music I would play when I was up all night. It is complex but does not clash like some of Chic Corea's music. A bit more gentle.
4,The Ruby Raven,"Finnegan Zwake's mystery-writer uncle is nominated for the Ruby Raven, an award presented to mystery writers from around the world. The award is worth one-million dollars, and Finn's Uncle Stoppard is determined to win it. Finn and his Uncle Stoppard have to travel to exotic Occo to qualify, and before they even get on the plane, they are faced with danger. I enjoy mysteries and this one was good. It kept me interested and Michael Dahl is a excellent writer. This is the second Finnegan Zwake Mystery I've read and this one was just as good as the first."
1,Disappointing,"The novel is uselessely ornate. Language translations is pretty bad, the use of some words and concepts is stretched to a breaking point. For a king to be afraid of his own sword is most laughable and the attempts to counter its curse with a red ruby who's fictional story a British boy concotes on the fly is even more so. Unless you are truly bored with life .. and can't findanything to read .. don't spend the [money] on this book, go to a movie."
3,Did not like it much,"I used the skin once on my camera, it made it difficult to use the controls - especially if you do not know the camera well and cannot see the symbols or writing on the camera. I will try it again once I am more familiar with the camera."
1,Olympus Clear Skin for Stylus,The product does not cover the camera easily. There is not an opening to put the carrying strap. If pulled the wrong way-it tears. Which mine did. I found it of NO use.
2,Gets torn,"Good product as far as protecting your camera, but tears easily after 1 vacation's worth of use."
4,"Recommended, but...","Pluses: Overall, a great idea. It goes on pretty easily once you get used to how much you have to stretch it (basically the whole camera goes in thru the opening for the LCD display). With a little adjusting, the openings in the skin perfectly match the lens, flash, and other spots on the camera. It really does make the camera easier to hold onto, and although it covers the buttons, they're still easy enough to operate.Minuses: It gets a little annoying if you often change the battery (as we did on a recent vacation -- each day we swapped batteries between the camera and the charger) or memory card. A nice thing about a waterproof camera -- you can just keep it in your pocket while swimming, but the skin makes it harder to slip in and out of a pocket (which could be a plus, also). Finally, after 7 days in the Caribbean sun the original clear/white color has weathered to a fairly unattractive yellow.Bottom line: Go ahead and buy it, but maybe get it in a color other than clear."
1,Ripped before I ever got on camera,"The thing ripped before I even got it on the camera, and I was trying to be carefull. I have a skin on my iPod that works great. This skin is less than useless.It would be too much of a hassle to try to return, so I just wasted $16 plus tax."
1,lasted a week,"As others have said previously, this thing doesn't last. It feels nice to have it on the camera, but after taking it off and putting it back on a couple of times it just rips and then its no good."
2,"Great idea, badly thought out","Wanted this to protect our Stylus camera, but quickly learned that you had to take it off each time you download as it does not have a cut out for the download door/port, or for the battery door, so same with every time you need to recharge the battery. PIA!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!!,This CD is a work of modern classical art in the usual Rondo Veneziano genius! This is a MUST have CD in any collection!
3,"A nice sound, but doesn't live up to it's predecessors.","Marco Polo has a great, opening sound, with a broad orchestral backing....then it lingers on into the traditional Rondo Veneziano sound, notably the oboe, violin, and drum set. There's a nice, melancholy piece played altogether on the piano as well, but it appears as if the group is starting to run out of ideas for their music. The final tracks on the CD are a blend of orchestra and oriental sounds that just don't really seem to blend too well. It is innovative in a sense, but don't expect to hear the suave sounds you heard at EPCOT on Marco Polo- try some of the many other CD's by Rondo Veneziano instead. Particularily, the Mozart album and the Greatest Hits."
4,Luscious pictures,"This is to rebut the previous review. Based on that review, I scanned our library copy carefully before checking it out. I found the book delightful and immediately shared it with my children. Some of the ""objectionable"" pictures are subjectively interepreted--for instance, where the previous reviewer saw an insane man dressed as batman, I merely saw as Batman himself (supported by the fact that if one looks carefully at the pictures, you can also find Little Red Riding Hood and Mary Poppins). I found the nude beach (less than one inch square) but completely missed the ""children spying on naked people."" The ghosts are teeny and cute. And so on. My children loved looking for the common elements in each beautiful picture. As in any book, look it over yourself and decide if you want your kids to see it. There ARE three or four impaled men in one scene, though, like every other element they are very small. I felt that these tiny images did not detract from a beautiful book."
5,my favourite baby book!!!,"this book is my favorite book to watch with my one and a half year old daughter. everytime we turn the page she points at the yellow ballon and makes a funny sound. she can also show many other things like vulcano, plane ... many more. with this book you can teach your child the whole world and explain a lot of things about the earth. it's fun to watch for adults as well. GREAT JOB done by the artist!"
1,Completely inappropriate for young children.,"I would strongly urge any parent not to let your child read this book. I took my 5 year old son to the library today and found this in his pile when we got home. Looking very innocent at first I had fun finding the yellow balloon until I took a closer look. There ARE witches flying around and then burning something, images of a person lying in the street injured after falling off his bike, a funeral happening where people are carrying the casket, a medieval fight happening where one man is lying on the ground bleeding, not to mention the nude beach scene where you can see nipples and pubic hair drawn in. So many injured people (a plane crash with no help in sight), scary ghosts, and people being chased by wild animals is enough to make me take this book back to the library and never check it out again. This is the first review I've written on a book but I felt so strongly about it that I wanted to deter any parent from getting this for a child of any age."
1,"Drunks, Prostitutes, and Naked People?","I too was at first charmed by the lovely style of painting, and the joy my 3-year-old takes in searching for things in pictures. Then I started to REALLY LOOK. I don't mind Batmen and fairy tale characters (including witches, etc.), but this book really crossed the line of (not so) common decency. This is the first time I've been moved to write a review (and we've read a LOT of books!!). I wouldn't even buy this book for a grownup!!!! UGH."
5,The Unknown Mystic,"Jacob Boehme is probably one of the most unknown mystics of our time; due to the nature and seriousness of his works. He often cautioned his readers that reading his writings without ernest intention to live the ""new birth"" life is ternamount to invoking the Holy names of God within one's self, which carries with it consequences. Jacob's writings initiated me into true understanding of the christain faith and the scriptures that have been long misinterpreted by ""babel"". Jacob believed that any one can arrive at his understanding and wisdom if only they can resign themselves to God and give up selfhood and the insatiable seeking of the pleasures and glory of this world. The divine spark is in all!!"
4,Tasty!,"These guys rock! This CD, as good as it is, isn't thier best. ""Soon to Sound What Where"" has their best songs. Do yourself a favor and go see these guys live! They leave it all on the stage. They rock hard, and lay down infectious grooves that will satisfy a large spectrum of musical tastes."
