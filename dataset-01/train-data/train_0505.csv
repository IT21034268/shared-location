4,What Would Biff Do?,"The story of Jesus' childhood as told through the eyes of his best friend is just too good of an idea to pass up. Chris Moore does a terrific job of sketching out the misadventures of Biff (Levi), Joshua (Jesus), and Maggie (Mary Magdalene) as they grow up. Biff was resurrected by the angel Raziel in order to tell the tale; these are hilarious episodes that are interspersed with these childhood memories. I laughed a lot while reading this book and it made me remember some of those dreary Sunday School lessons with a new perspective. The story does slow down a bit towards the end in order to weave into the common knowledge. On the plus side, it has many great jokes and one-liners. And most importantly, this book confirmed that God doesn't care if you eat bacon. Yum!"
4,"Oh my, ""true"" christians, beware - you'll have to think !!","Simply, I was shocked -- and laughed, laughed and laughed. The puns on jewish customs, the basis for jewish new york chinese on christmas day, among other things, Biff himself, left me in stitches. Their lives in the east, the miracles, who knows, but wonderfully worth fantasizing upon. I enjoyed it...It proves religion can be dealt with in a serious/funny manner and to heck with the ""true believers."""
4,I always wondered what went on after the manager ...,"I first thought this was going to be a Douglas Adams-ish take on the life of Jesus (nay Joshua). But, while the book was certainly funny, I found it to be even more insightful. Not sure the typical American Christian will want to or enjoy reading this. However, if you have an open mind toward how things could have been and if you ever wondered it was like to grow up under the star of Bethlehem, this is a book for you.Enjoy"
5,Long winded but worth the ride & read,"First of all, I will say that I'm not religious. However, if this is what it's supposed to be, then maybe I should reconsider. Blasphemous? Maybe, but an enjoyable and truly inspired read nonetheless.I laughed some, but it was also a story of true friendship, through thick and thin; doubt and belief. As others say, the ending isn't a surprise, but the way it's lovingly told by Biff, puts a human and believable face on the events leading up to the finale.Can't wait to read the sequel! A movie wouldn't be a bad thing, either, but I doubt it could be made."
2,Corny,"I just couldn't get in to this one. Moore's other books are awesome. I wasn't offended by the subject matter, it just wasn't funny to me."
5,"Funny, but heartfelt","I was a little skeptical about this book as a Christian, but I can safely say I had nothing to worry about. Granted, I'm a Christian who also practices elements of Buddhism, so I was on board with Lamb from the beginning and was pleasantly surprised with Jesus and Biff's adventures into the East.Lamb is a hilarious look at what Jesus' life may have been like and is surprisingly reverent toward him. It is a wonderfully paced story that will have you laughing the entire time."
5,You'll pee your pants by page ten,"Just read this book. It's that good.This is a very funny, light hearted, well written work of fiction. Even God laughed."
4,Lamb is hilarious!,"Needed a book to read on a plane ride so browsed and found this. Thought it would be fun since I work closely with a Presbysterian pastor and could tease her. It was more than I could have imagined. Totally irreverent but hilariously funny! I laughed out loud. Highlighted portions on my Kindle Fire and had my husband read them. He was laughing so hard that he had to wipe tears from his eyes and he is not easily amused.My pastor friend was so amused by my recounting of parts of the book she went ahead and downloaded it herself. Others that heard us discuss/laugh also downloaded/bought the book.If you have an open mind and need a good, cleansing, laugh, read Lamb...The Gospel According to Biff. Make sure you have an empty bladder before beginning the book. It's that funny!"
2,Just ugh,"I have this terrible habit of being unable to stop reading a book once I've started unless it is just God-awful, irredeemably bad. Sometimes that is more painful than others. This was one of those times. Slogging through this book has been a nightly sentence.I take exception with the idea that this is funny, insightful or good. In a nutshell: a new friend - Biff - is inserted into the life of Jesus, and we learn what happened during his previously undocumented years. Guess what? Biff has modern sensibilities and a filthy mouth. Isn't that hilarious and original? No, not really. And that's it. That's all the story has going for it. One cheap trick that has been done before and better.I read Moore's latest book Sacre Bleu, and I didn't hate it. It wasn't a truly great story, but it was readable and infinitely clever. Aside from the fact that both stories focus inordinately on sex, I would not think they are by the same author."
2,Not amused,I am a christian that could not get my head wrapped around a spoof on Jesus. So this was a waste of my time to read.
2,NOT MOORE'S BEST,"I consider myself a fan, but this is not Christopher Moore's best book. In fact, this is his worst. It kind of runs out of steam about half way through. His earlier works have been breezier and swifter reading.LAMB is the life of Christ as seen through the eyes of his best friend Biff. Moore adds a lot of humor not found in the Bible. Jesus alternately killing a lizzard and bringing it back to life, and Biff lusting after Mary. Apparently, the mother of Jesus was hot. Unfortunately, after the bits of humor played out, the thing starts to get a bit tedious.Enjoyable, but I can't help thinking CM could have done more with the material, given his particular slant."
2,where is the plot?,"it starts with a good premise, ripe for possibilties and humor but I'm a quarter of the way through and am bored! there isnt any tension or apparent forshadowing of anything interesting coming and barely any humor imho. i read Fool and thought it was funny and interesting so i bought this thinking it would have those same assets but its just not going anywhere. the author has not provided any hint that things will get more interesting further in and with so many other books to read i think thats a shame and a missed opportunity to include the most basic storytelling device: a reason to keep reading."
3,Somewhat cute and mildly funny,"Overall is quite disappointing, and not engaging enough to be a good entertainment. I suppose author's aim was higher than that, and from time to time there is glimmer of depth, but the promise is kept unfullfilled."
5,I wish it were longer,This was a very good and funny book. Nothing too offensive for the average evangelical but then again I doubt any evangelical will read it. My only complaint was that it was too short. I wish the author went into more detail on Joshua's life before his mission.
5,In times like these...,"...LAMB is exactly what we need--it's the perfect marriage of humor and humanity. Hilarious, touching, and wise--anyone who reads and loves this book (and all of Chris Moore's others) is a friend of mine (not that that's such a coup, but you get my drift). He obviously did his homework and then set his incredible imagination loose. What he has come up with for us is nothing short of absolutely original, filled with fun and heart. If Christ exists--and if he does he's surely an avid reader--he'll love this. Pass it on..."
4,Funny x 345,"This is seriously one of the best books of fiction that I have ever read.Some extreme Christians may be extremely offended at the ...possible sacrilegious element. Although, I really have to say as a non-extreme Christian that this book actually made more sense of my religion for me.This book is beyond funny, and really does make you think about the various religions. It's well thought out and flows very nicely. It also doesn't take Jesus/ Joshua off a pedestal, but gives you a better understanding that he really was a person before the end. A person with friends, family, a life and interests. But, of course keep in mind that this is a work of fiction. Although, that isn't hard... Because of Biff, who is such an original character idea.I say, It's a great read. **** & 1/2"
3,Too Much Lamb,First third was hilarious. Middle dragged and was not all that funny. Last 88 pages was work.
5,"Lamb, A sinner""s opinion","I am a huge Christopher Moore fan, and I found Lamb both wonderfully funny and heartfelt. I am a Christian and I know that God and the Son both have a soft spot for fools and children. I am 58 years old so I am not a child but a fool, maybe. One of my joys as a Christan is the ability to laugh and Christopher Moore ""gets it"". I also read ""the Stupidist Angel"" every Christmas."
3,Enjoyable but not 4 or 5 star material.,"I got some general laughs out of it. Decent novel. Not as blasphemous as you would expect. Quite the opposite in fact. The certainly is an undercurrent of, I don't know, catholicness or reverance, behind the sometime hilarity. Could have been better but was certainly worth a read."
5,Really great book,"This is the book that made Christopher Moore one of my favorite writers. I love how clever and funny it is without being disrespectful in any way to Christianity. I recommend this book to everyone with a sense of humor. Christopher Moore has a wonderful imagination. (Give ""Fool"" a read too)!"
5,WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY LOOKING AT ITS COVER???,"I read this book, first, as a paperback. Loved it so much I purchased a short stack (hold the maple syrup) of this very special gift edition. The perfect gift for loved ones who love a brilliant, fall-down funny book. It's not only one of the best written books ever (Christopher Moore, you rock!) but also, perhaps, the best damn ""packaging"" and book design since, well ... the bible? Yes, I highly recommend it to one and all.""Two very big and happy thumbs (and eyeballs) up!""-- Edwin Heaven"
5,"Funny, smart, irreverent without being disrespectful","I am not a Christian, but I also am not interested in bashing another's beliefs. I laughed out loud throughout this engaging novel. This book puts a spin on the whole ""Jesus thing"" that portrays him as divine and human, with VERY human friends. It also gave some interesting insights into the apostles and the culture of the times. Dont be turned off from this book because you are not ""into"" religion. Also, dont be turned off if you are. There is something here for both."
5,"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal","This was one of the funniest books I have ever read. From beginning to end I laughed out loud. I enjoyed this bood so much, I went out and bought 3 more of Christopher Moore's books. His books are pure joy!!!"
5,A book about Christ even an agnostic can love!,"I'll admit, I had a bias going into this because a) I'm already a huge Moore fan, and b) I'm agnostic, so I never mind a little irreverent humor at the expense of our established authorities. However, Lamb exceeded even my expectations. I found myself reading lines (even whole scenes) to my husband so often, that he decided to read the book (which is something he never does). I know this is one I'll read again and again. I encourage even the most devout Christians to read it, not only for its pure entertainment factor, but because I think it's beneficial to see the humanized image of Jesus Moore writes of. He was a real person, the greatest man to ever walk the Earth, in my opinion, and sometimes we forget that even the Bible admits he had weaknesses and troubles. Though it's pure fiction, Moore's idea of how Jesus spent his life is as heartwarming as any other I can think of, and a good deal funnier!"
5,Moore's best book yet,"Having read every Chris Moore book, I must admit that the premise of this book didn't strike me as being one that would be very amusing. After having read it, I can honestly say that this is far and away his best book. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard or been touched so much. I immediately got copies for all of my family and friends. This book is a must read!"
5,Histerical,I love this book. It is funny and intersting. If you like the movie Dogma then you'll love this book.
5,One of my all-time favorite novels,"I'm a pastor, so I read the real Bible frequently. Lamb is not the Bible; Moore admits that it is total fiction. However, in a sacrilegious way, Moore offers some beautiful (and sometimes disturbing) vignettes of what Jesus' childhood might have been like. He does such a good job with the psychological and the spiritual development of Jesus. I found myself time and again thinking, ""You know, it really could have been like this."""
5,Great Story,"If you've ever wondered what Jesus, aka Joshua, might have done in his adolecence, then read this book. It will make you laugh and will expand your imagination, and maybe even make you a better person. Fun read!"
4,Hot and heavy inter-racial homosexual dynamics,"This is an vividly written and (in several senses) exciting tale of a black gay father who has a virulently homophobic son (raised by the mother) and a white boyfriend the same age. All three have strong feelings that are not politically correct. They (and also a white hustler who was an earlier protege of the father) have graphically described sex and erotic responses.Structurally, the book should have ended at p. 249. Instead, it veers off into another interesting and vivid story and an implausible ending."
3,Never Judge A Book By Its Cover,"I purchased this book because of the cover photograph. Regretably, there are few other photographs within that have the same grace and directness, few where the subject is as strong. The majority of the pictures within would more appeal to the bondage or S/M fetishist. Although I am in no way a prude, I did not anticipate such a preponderance of that subject matter based on the cover design and the Amazon write-up. Without a doubt there is a great deal of skill and craftsmanship involved, and the photos are wonderfully washed and tinted, but there is much less celebration of the fullness of femininity here then I would have hoped for. Persons who enjoy bondage, flagellation and leather accouterments may rate this work higher."
2,Dark and Gloomy Photographs,The picture on the cover can be considered one of the better photos in the whole book. The first few pages of the book appears promising. However many of the photographs starts to take on a dark and gloomy feeling especially those with a S&M theme. The different shades and tainting of the photos only add to the gloomy feeling.A few of the models in the book are fairly attractive and the photographer is able to bring out their beauty in a erotic and suggestieb manner. However almost more than half of the book contains photos of S&M and that may be the downside of this otherwise promising book.
1,Eros-free erotica,"It is difficult to imagine an erotic photography collection being neither arousing nor artistic, and yet this is exactly what China Hamilton managed to achieve in this less-than-memorable composition. I can only pity these obviously beautiful models presented in such an unappealing fashion. If there is a hidden message here, I failed to see it. My recommendation: stick to the higher calibre artists; Sieff, Newton, Kroll, Kloster, Dahmane, Stuart."
1,Biased,"The typographical and grammatical errors make your teeth grind, the factual content (including geographically) is appalling, and the generalizations about small town life are enough to make anyone who grew up in a small town want to scream. The author's attitude is that he is the only one capable of understanding why April did what she did and that the verdict was justified. If you really want to read the book and you know someone who owns it, borrow it. Please don't give any more money to this author for his lousy effort."
1,HORRIBLE!,It does seem as if Mr. Warren could write an accurrate review if he is going to call this non-fiction. I was in that courtroom and the events were nothing like the author relates. I wouldn't recommend that you waste your time or money with this book.
1,Misinformed,"... It is obvious that the book was not properly edited and the material itself is biased. The book seems to solely focus on the murderer's family information, and does not touch on that of the victim's. ... Overall it was a struggle to read and a great disappointment. ..."
2,Not his best work,"I saw Maynard twice live, and I also own the DVD ""Live from the Top"". I have yet to see any DVD that captures what I saw in concert, but this has to be the worst attempt I've seen. The band sounded bored, Maynard was not at the top of his game, and overall it was an extremely lackluster performance. ""Live from the Top"" isn't great, but it's a better alternative than this."
5,Maynard RIP,"This is one of the best music DVDs I have ever purchased. Every solo in the group played great. The only thing I disliked is the fact that there were no extras. No behind the scene extras. No bio's about the members in the group. But, overall the play of these cats are great."
3,"It""s OK","Kind of awkward to mount it, as it has to mount on a windshield only. Doesn't always stay there, either."
2,Suction Cup is Weak,"The suction cup on this product is weak. It has come off so many times that I am giving up on it. I had the cup holder version of this before and I really liked it. I can't use this version in my current car so I tried the suction cup version.Too bad. I really like the way this holder cradles the phone. It is very secure yet easy to remove.However, it is really annoying when it keeps popping off the window while I am driving. I am using it on a side window with the mount resting on the dashboard. You would think that would put less strain on the suction cup and make it stay on. I think the suction cup is just too shallow."
5,Best In Class,The Bracketron products are top notch. Already had one of these for MY car and the Missus was so taken with it she wanted one of her own. Found the best price on Amazon and bought it right away. Now the Wife is very happy. . . Thanks.
2,Mobile Grip-iT,"I've owned one of these before, which I purchased locally. It worked great for quite a while; until it finally broke.This one, however, which I purchased through Amazon, stopped working after a few days: The gears inside stopped working so I couldn't get it to hold my phone any more.I've purchased several items from Amazon and have never had any complaints with any of those items. This is a first.It was probably just a fluke that I received a bad one, because, like I said, I've owned this particular item before and it worked great."
4,mount,the arm itself is good but the actual bracket that holds your device is kind of lacking. i did not like the release button. this bracket once you lock it onto your device you press the button on bottom left multiple times to ratchet it open. when doing so sometimes it feels and sounds like it will break. i took this bracket off and used one of my older brackets with a better release mechanism.
5,Does what it's supposed to.....,The mount is sturdy and adjusts to accomodate most smartphones. The suction cup is strong and the unit is easy to install. The bendable arm conforms to many different positions. No problems - end of story.
3,Bracketron Swivel Mount,"All in all good product for price. Ratcheting jaws hold product but seems like with a little to much force could break. Suction cup is great no problems, arm is pretty ridged but yet flexible enough to easily manipulate."
4,Nice but could be nicer,"The quick-release just isn't so quick. I wished that the closing system was spring-loaded and not a ratcheting system. However, with that said, I think it's a very nice mount that fits almost all portable devices."
4,Works really well except in the winter,"When I first bought this it worked magnificantly.. but then winter came and it got too cold. When I tried to adjust it, it fell off...every time! I think it's a great tool and I hope that they make more with improvements for different temperatures."
5,Works as intended.,"Given what other reviews said, I took a tiny leap of faith and bought two for a couple of our vehicles. Agree with all the positive comments given. In and out of device is easy, propping against dash makes it more ""solid"" in terms of vibrations, flex arm is stiff enough yet bends well for adjustment."
1,not what I expected,"Bought this product last April 2012 just so we have something to use when the need arises. Kept it sealed until Memorial day becoz we're going out of town only to find out that it was not exactly the same as the one shown in the picture. I got a mount that can only be used in a 90-degree angle windshield. The small tail at the end of ""S"" shape at the suction base was missing. The suction base is directly attached to the tip of ""S""; there was no short tail at the tip of the ""S"" to attach the suction base. Couldn't return it coz the 30-day return policy had already expired. Waste of money!!!"
1,Bracketron Mobile Grip It Mount - SUCKS!,Right out of the box it would not adjust.Called there 1-800 # and got no help.I left messages and no one ever returned my calls!Do NOT waste your money on a Bracketron...
4,Inspiring Book,"I admire honesty and Candy Chand admits there are some things she doesn't know. In spite of a lack of understanding of life's mysteries, she has discovered faith and trust in God and invites readers to share in some of her discoveries. In addition to her personal experiences, she brings added insight from other sources to explain in detail how one can apply each of the seven graces to one's own life. Each chapter concludes with a helpful summary in itemized form. Readers can be thankful Candy applied the principle of fortitude to make this book possible. On page 109 she defines it as ""the virtue of perseverance, to endure sometimes difficult circumstances with the sheer determination to see your dreams come to pass."""
4,George Foreman Side by Side,"Works very well, works as advertised, I don't over cook meats with this product, and of course fat if any drips away into the tray provided. Cleaning up the cooking surface was easy enough however as other people had mentioned when trying to clean the upper lip portion liquids drips down the backside of the grill, I put a barely moist dish towel over the area and it's easy to just toss that in the washer. Make sure you understand the SIZE of the side by side grill before ordering and have space for it."
2,not as wide as i thought....,"it needs a case for it to stand becuase it gets top heavy and i thought it would be wider, also if you have nightvision on your camcorder it will block the infrared light on the camcorder , but it does look better gives it an HD look, over all the HD look makes up for it but now i have to spend more money on a stand."
2,Cheap,Cheap. Not much a wider angle. Don't buy inexpensive stuff when it comes to camera equipment because you get what you pat for.
3,Too large for outdoor sports,"I purchased for use with the Sony CX110 mini camcorder which is used for skydiving videos and is attached to a helmet. I was quite surprised by the size of this lens - it's huge! Unfortunately it's so wide (and heavy) that I was concerned about equipment (canopy lines) getting caught on this and wasn't willing to chance it. I would not suggest anyone that uses this for outdoor sports skydiving,BMX, skateboarding etc because of the weight and width."
5,Great Lens,"I use this lens with a Canon HF100. It works great and looks good too. I haven't taken it off since putting it on.For the price you can't beat it. Especially when considering the Canon equivalent lens costs upwards of $200.Canon 1305B001 WD-H37C Wide Converter Lens for HF10, HF100 & HR10 CamcordersGreat product."
1,Dice does not rule,In this DVD Dice is early in his career and is not very good. In fact it is horrible. Save your money.
1,Bill Hicks Was Right,This is a perfect example of what Bill Hicks used to rant about. Mediocre hacks live forever and pollute the earth with their existence while brilliant geniuses die way too early.....RIP Bill! I'm afraid you were right.......you died at 33 and Andrew is STILL HERE! Get me off this planet now!
5,Classic Dice,"Arrived quickly, packaged well, no scratches. Played and entertained, if you like Dice Clay you will love this piece of his collection."
4,srh2767,"Good DVD! It shows Dice as he is, unedited or polished! It is a little on the rough side, but that only makes it better, Dice should be rough, not polished... Good DVD for the guys in the man cave."
4,50 Science Activities for Your Kindergarten Classroom,"This book does a wonderful job in breaking down their science experiments into seasons; Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer. The first few pages of the book are dedicated to using science in your classroom, including using journals. Each activity is well layed out, and easy to follow. They list the materials needed, the aim of the activity, a warm-up, the activity, things to remember, observations, books that tie into the activity, and also some spin-off projects. This book could also be used by younger classes. To gain five stars, I would have liked to had more involved projects. I think sometimes, we under-estimate the learning capabilities of our kids."
5,Such a good book,"Brookland was a tremendous pleasure to read. It's an excellent story, and the voice is consistent and convincing. Living in Brooklyn, it's wonderful to imagine what it was like more than 200 years ago, and Emily Barton does a beautiful job creating that world. The characters seem very real, in their faults as well as their dreams.It may be a bit on the gloomy side, but understandably: there are constant reminders of how hard life was, in ways it isn't so much anymore--so many babies dying, for one thing. I found it all fascinating."
4,Great Historical Fiction,"This book describes ""possibility"" as well as anything I have ever read. The story traces the Prudence Winship's dream from first moments to actualization in prose that is beautiful."
3,I felt used at the end,"Emily Barton has a way with a turn of phrase. I went back and re-read certain lines like poetry. The story is interesting and very involved. It is a long novel, but I thought worth it until the last page. Be forewarned - there was no reason to end it this way and that abruptly. Did anyone else feel this way?"
3,characters don't match time period,"I enjoyed the characters in the book. My opinion is they don't fit the time period that this book was taking place in. The characters seemed very progressive for this historical time period. When reading, at times I forgot the book was set in post-Revolutionary days."
3,This is good but?,"Of course this album is gonna be game tight but c'mon guys. It's a greatest hits cd. The problem with this is every time a group comes out with a greatest hits joint, it means their done, no mas. It's too bad these cats have issues because they need to get back to the days of all that conspiracy and political knowledge they were talking about on soul food back in 94. First of all this is a good album, but if youve never peeped a goodie album get soul food. In my opinion it's one of the best and most conscious hip hop albums ever produced. One of the only albums where 1 -20 are all off the charts. Not to mention some old school Andre and Big Boi action."
4,Great Scripture Summary & Review,"My book study group is reading this book together. Though I am clergy and have studied scripture pretty extensively, the other members of the group are laywomen who don't have any (or much) scriptural study. We are all delighted with this book, and it is really enlightening scripture for them, providing historical and cultural context that gives us all great insight into why interpreting scripture literally impoverishes the magnificence and depth of it."
1,Scam Artists on Prowl,"Yet another example of scam artists in action. A (...) plasma TV for (...) I doubt it. I have tried ordering these 10 cents on the dollar ""values"" and all 15 of them have been bogus. Amazon has been really good at kicking these scammers off, but only after they've listed. Wish they'd require a better kind of upfront verification of goods, but oh well, it's always been buyer beware!"
3,"63"" HDTV for $350?!!?!! C'mon",I'm finding that really hard to believe. I hope someone at Amazon is reviewing these offers. If there real its a great deal but I don't think they are. I haven't seen a deal like this anywhere
4,good-ish,"this plasma is good-ish. Not-ish because it is big and flat, whcih causes owie-zowie headaches. happy AND not-ish plasma consumer..by the way, consumer sounds like you're eating dairy products or something. But plasma is a good TV source but a little bit pricy."
2,Almost,This is almost authentic and almost Irish. It's also almost professional which is better than the last album these guys released.
4,I loved this series!,My 4 stars aren't for the book but for the series. Pirvan is an interesting person indeed. His ability to bring together a strange band of misfits & lead them is similar to Tanis's.I love to watch a character's journey from his younger years to his later ones & this is a wonderful example of my tastes.
3,Not a good way to start off a series,"I imagine this story reads better if you are not familiar whith Dragonlance. The story is not bad, it just isn't very good. If you are an avid fantasy reader, and tend to like most of what you read, this book won't disappoint you.If however, you find it hard to get good fantasy stories these days, dont waste your time.If you want to read any of the stories in this series, jump to Theros Ironfeld (vol. 4). This is a much better written story."
3,I dunno???,"While I thought that the book was interesting it wasn't quite what I expected. The book is set during the time of Istar's power, but before that final Kingpriest. The characters were good, except I'm still not crazy about Haimya, but there was so much more you could do with them. Another thing was that I was expecting some jousting, some duels, honorable things like that, but instead you get a pirate adventure. It was good, but I think even I could have done better."
3,Knights of Solamnia,"The Knights of Solamnia were the greatest order of knights in Krynn. All who wish to be knights must first enter as squires in the Crown order. This sees the story of Sir Pirvan, who has potential as a Knight of the Crown."
1,Too bad I paid for it,"I can't believe it took me 97 pages before I decided to through it away. I was a third of the way through the book and could barely tell where the book was going. Why did the ""author"" feel so strongly about adding in every magical creature known to man but they had absolutely nothing to do with the story up to that point. If you ever want to read about how to break into a house, you can read 20 pages on it in this book. Yuck."
1,Knights...Where?,"One word: Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z200 pages that describe absolutely nothing up to every single detail, during which you only hear about a ship in a storm, a thief who doesn't steal, a mage who doesn't cast spells, warriors who don't fight... You get the picture.But don't get me wrong, it's a great book...FOR INSOMNIACS!!!"
3,Pretty good........,"When I first started reading this book, it was really boring. It had been hard for me to even keep reading it. But on the last 100 or so pages, it got really good. I noticed this about all the Knights books by Roland Green. I wouldn't really recomend it unless you are a dragonlance fan, and have read other DL books. All in all, it was pretty good, but not as good as many other books. If you want to read a good dragonlance book which explains a lot about the world of Krynn, get a book from a better author. All of Green's Knights books didn't really explain much about the rest of Krynn, just Istar, and they certainly weren't as good as I had hoped But, they are worth reading I guess."
1,love camp 1,"was not quite what I remembered. Some nice T&A, but that is it. A gorilla pounding on a typewriter could have come up with a better script. the love scenes completely lacked variety..I don't think I will even re-gift this one"
4,Not just another Holocaust book,"Because I read The Girl in the Red Coat in German, I cannot speak for the translation, although knowing the care with which it was prepared, I'm sure that it is a good one. Not having read any German in a couple of decades, I was apprehensive at taking on the work. But I could not put the book down. Roma Ligocka's story is so compelling, in part because it is told from the view point of herself as a young child, in part because of the amazing work the author has done in working through her trauma. Not just another book about the Holocaust, this is an example of the healing power of art and of literature."
2,"Really not worth it, and the title is misleading","It would really be misleading to call this a Holocaust memoir. Roma Ligocka does write about the Holocaust, but she was a very young child, a toddler, during that time and her vague, fragmentary memories of it take up only a few chapters of the book. The rest of the book is about her growing up and her adulthood as an artist. I didn't find the book all that interesting, and I thought Roma liked to promote herself a lot, talking about how beautiful she was, etc. Interesting detail: Roma's cousin is the famous film director Roman Polanski, and he's one of the major characters in the early part of the book."
1,A book of vanity,"I have read hundreds of books about those who survived the holocaust but this is one book I cannot recommend. Although you get a glimpse of what life during the holocaust may have been like, you unfortunately get too many glimpses of a woman who thrives on vanity. Throughout the book, Roma time and time again stresses how pretty she was and how many men wanted to marry her. Roma is a woman who you cannot come to care about as she cares so much about herself but not in the way of her survival but instead her looks."
3,Lame,"After reading Shatterpoint this was a disappointment. While I did like the treatment of the clone soldier, I thought the treatment of Obiwan was just plain dumb. If the Jedi were that easy to fool, what made them so great? Also, the reactions of the Regent were unrealistic.Still, if you're a Star Wars fan it's worth the read."
4,Best Star Wars Novel Since Shadow Hunter,"Dont bother reading unless youre a Star Wars Fan. Purists in Science Fiction wont get it and certainly wont like it. Star Wars novels are like Summer Blockbuster Movies...some are bad, some are great, but none make it to Oscar Night. Personally, I loved this book...Obi is great and this book has almost no Anakin Skywalker in it which is satisfying since he has become awfully whiny. Also, for the villian was unexpected and refreshing."
2,chick-lit,"This book has one huge flaw. The over-the-top humanising of a clone-trooper. The author kept building on this theme until the nauseating Chapter 67, which had me reaching for a vom-bucket.There should be a warning sticker on this book - ""chick-lit"", because it is literature for chicks. Whoever gave this guy the keys to the ""Star Wars books"" kingdom should snatch them right back from him. He has abused the privilege bestowed upon him."
2,"Very bad, very boring","This was the first Star Wars book I ever read and is a very very poor introduction to Star Wars pulp literature. The storyline is not very engaging, the characters are flat, the writing is mediocre at best, and the action scenes are extremely confusing. The Kenobi character is not used to good effect, the Fisto character is expanded upon and not very interesting, some decent storywise stuff is attempted with the clones but takes a back seat to the boring main storyline of the Cestus Deception. Just not a very good book in any respect at all. Don't let this be your introduction to the Star Wars Expanded universe. Since this book I have read the Darth Bane trilogy which is much better in every respect."
1,bad,I found this book really boring and plain and there was hardly any action. I don't recommend this book for thrill seekers.
2,Should Have Read The Reviews......,"I would have avoided buying the book if I had read all the reviews that told us in advance about it. I won't go in a lot repeating what others have offered, but I will say that the book showed an entirely different Kit Fisto than I had hoped for. Instead of a quick witted intelligent Jedi, we were delivered a brooding, boring, out of character individual, who hardly displayed his skills with the lightsaber against one of the super villains of the books and cartoon series.For those of you who are now into the Star Wars books, do read the reviews. They are worth your while in helping you select the best in the many Star Wars novels."
1,This book is nothing more then a rip off,"First off I would like to apologize to those of you that take the time to write these reviews, I didn't read them before I bought this book if I had I probably would not have.This book is a not very well written short story with a lengthily Q&A; with the author about his next book which is probably another stupid short story and long Q&A; about his next stupid book I won't know because I will never buy another book by this guy. If I want a short story I'll buy a comic book and not pay over $7.00 for it.If the publisher wants to print a short story or a Q&A; with the author they should do one and or the other not together and pass it of as a book to con $7.19 out of my pocket"
2,"Even though I am a HUGE fan of Star Wars, I didn't like it.","This story takes place in the Clone Wars. The Clone Wars was my favorite era in Star Wars, so I thought I would like it, like Shatterpoint, which I liked.I have to be honest in saying that I hated it. The author dragged everything out, and I wish he would have just shortened it and taken out all the drecriptions of everything. It seemed to go on and on about small details that really didn't need to be mentioned. Don't read it if you don't have to."
4,"Though I am a ""Star Trek"" fan...","Though I am an avid ""Star Trek"" fan, I am also a fan of ""Star Wars"" and many, many other sci-fi adventure and space opera works, such as: ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Puppet Masters"", ""Foundation"", ""2001"", ""2010"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""Ringworld"", all the ""Star Trek"" books, ""Advent of the Corps"" and others. Definite two thumbs up on this ""Star Wars"" book! Its space opera adventure lives on!"
3,could have been better,"I have to say this novel was too long. The reason was the love story with one of the clones. I'd estimate 25% of the novel was centered around this. I feel the writer strayed too far off the mark with this love story being so dominant. Yes, at the end of the Novel, Jangotat disobeys an order due to his new found, individuality. But, there could have been much easier and shorter ways to accomplish or set up a clone to disobey an order; which happens to save many lives. Also, I'm not sure I buy the fact of obi-wan and Kit Fisto deliberately misleading others and sabotaging civilian infrastructure. This depicted the Jedi in a poor and inaccurate light.This could have been a solid entry. However, the love story drew out the the novel too long to be really enjoyable. If you cut out the love story and take out the nonsense of Jedi sabotaging infrastructure to get the other side to bargain, you'd have a much better novel. I give it 2.5 to 3 stars."
2,The cestus pool,"It is, by far the worst Star Wars book I have read so far, and I've read quite a few. It turns perfectly cool things like ARC Troopers into soap-juggling sensitive nice-guys. I am not joking. The ARC trooper fell in love with somebody who was on the same slave ship as Jango Fett. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of it. Instead, buy Republic Commando: Hard Contact by Karen Traviss. A MUCH better book."
2,I didn't buy the whole storyline,"I can't really say much of anything good about this book. It was well written, but I didn't buy into the storyline or the actions of most of the characters. I didn't really come away with anything after reading it either. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,Definitely a great purchase,"I bought this at a retail location, was told it was an 'entry level' LCD and was the lowest priced 15"" w/HDTV compatibility. I did not notice any significant differences in the picture quality or features from any of the other similar brands also on display.I have it for about a month already, the picture quality is sharp, it was easy to set up for HD reception on DirecTV, and I am a happy camper. This set is definitely a great value and a giant leap ahead of the tube TV it replaced.It also has a 12 month parts and labor warranty, as best as I can remember all of the other name brands came with only a 90 day warranty. Recommended with NO reservations."
2,Doesnt have a dvi connection,"The details says it has DVI, theres no DVI. The panel is fine, the speakers are cheap. its an ok tv if it didnt lie about its specs"
2,very disappointed,"If you are looking for hdtv quality, forget about this one! Can pick up the signal with a cable box, then shrinks the picture. No expandable screen feature. Lacks useful features to compensate. Picture quality is decent in digital tv mode. Unit is compact. Good enough for a small computer monitor with adapter cable included. Thats about it.Also must use 1/4 in. stereo phono plug in HD mode to hear sound."
1,Atrocious translation to ebook! And I mean atrocious!,"I had just finished reading a Freedman hardcover book, and I wanted to read more Freedman. So I went on Amazon and purchased This book. I am sure that if I had read the hardcover or paperback version I would be giving it between 4-5 stars. But I NEVER imagined that I would be paying more than my normal outlay on Amazon's excellent selection of ebooks, for a book that is absolutely full of every sort of grammatical, spelling, missing words, indecipherable words etc.I had better stick to the .99c and 1.99c books - but NOT a single bargain book has had 1/10th of the mistakes (let alone 1/50th)!Does nobody in Amazon review an ebook before it is put on sale?"
4,Guess I almost stand alone....,"I really enjoyed this book! I had it around for some years, and never read it. Part way through it, I looked at the reviews it received on Amazon, and I was surprised that it did not receive that many stars. I did not read any of the reviews because I was enjoying the book, and I did until the very end. I will agree that it had its weak spots, and the ending was not all that spectacular. There was little character development of Diane, who was not all that great a character, and seemed to use her sexual charms to get what she wanted. I liked the interplay between the three sons, who seemed to love their parents,and could not understand what was going on with their dad. I would recommend that you give it a try."
2,Ugh,I gave up on it after a few pages because it was overly idyllic & overly descriptive about mundane things that were in no way central to the plot. It felt like I was reading filler material. This is made especially glaring by the fact that the first few pages are *supposed* to captivate you.
4,A Good Read,"This is not ususally the type of book that I pick up (not very action packed), but it was still a good read. The things I liked best about the book were the characters and the decriptions of the locations (Central America). The plot was a little slow but was interesting. Overall it was different type of book then I am used to, but I enjoyed it."
2,"An editor, an editor! My kingdom for an editor!","What you have here is about 60 pages of material stretched out to 498 pages. I can't believe I actually read the first 350 or so. It's as if Freedman and his publisher colluded to create a massive waste of time. The story is set up early and then goes nowhere for an eternity. Finally, when you can't stand the pointless descriptions and stagnant plot, you might be tempted to skip to the end. Unfortunately, at this point, it becomes clear that the author never intended for you to figure anything out until you had read about 400 pages. The ending is not only clumsy, but of a very ""deus-ex-machina"" nature; that is, there was never any reason to suspect the true culprit except that there was never any reason to suspect the true culprit. (Yes, I know that sounds redundant, but then the whole novel is an exercise in repetition. My sympathy if you paid for the hardcover version.)"
2,Too much angst; too little action,"To date, I have read all of J.F. Freedman's books and wish I had quit while I was ahead. This is like wanting to remember the dearly departed as young, healthy, and appealing instead of puny, wasting, later years. I hope the author returns to more likeable characters and more thrilling plot. This is NOTHING like ""Bird's Eye View "" It is a shame !"
3,"Not his best work, but readable","I was rather disappointed in this book, I have come to expect much more from him.There's too many unnecessary details about the children that make this book slow reading. The plot line is predictable. I actually started it three times before I was able to get interested enough to finish.I regret that I paid retail and did not wait to get a a used book store. It is sometimes hard to find his books there, but they had several copies of this one. I imagine many other local readers were disappointed also."
3,Where was the editor?,"I too am a long term fan of J.F.Freedman, but came away from his latest book disappointed. While starting out with a good story line, it quickly bogged down in too many words and details that added nothing significant to the plot or character development. The portrayal of the nefarious world of antiquity thievery, political corruption and human greed was solid despite the rather unbelievable efforts of family members to resolve their grief and confusion. Neither tight nor thrilling, but good beach reading."
2,Disappointing,"I'm just discovering Royo, and have ordered half a dozen of his books over the past month. Next to Conceptions 1, Women was the most disappointing in the set - there were only 3 or 4 images I liked in the entire volume. The book mostly contains images that look like seventies sci-fiction paperback cover art. I wouldn't have guessed Royo was the artist, particularly when I look at some of his more astonishing pieces from recent years. If you're new to Royo, get Secrets, Malefic, Visions and III Millenium instead - they're absolutely spectacular, and better illustrate (no pun intended :-) why Royo has earned such a loyal following."
4,A waste of great pieces of work in such a small size.,"SPECIFICS:Page Count: 80Number of images: 114Small images: 77Half page images: 10Full page images: 232-page spreads: 4BW images: 7TEXT:3 page introduction2 page forewordSmall paragraphs about the chapter's topic throughout the bookTitle and year of each paintingART:12 images: 5 stars46 images: 4 stars41 images: 3 stars12 images: 2 stars3 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 stars"
4,Erotic beyond comparison...,"Royo's work no longer needs any justification except itself. Whether or not you're a fan of the (mostly) second-rate science-fiction Royo lands the commissions for, there is no denying the power and the scope of these illustrations. In reading Royo's liner notes, you get the distinct impression he no longer cares whether or not you find hidden meaning or anything transcendental in his artistry... you're simply presented with a stark ""Hey, you like my work or not?"" After a journey through this collection, there's no way you could answer with anything other than ""Yes!"""
4,Delighfully full of good things...,This DVD is full of delightful ideas for a spooktacular Halloween. I did not get mine in time for Halloween 2006 but am already reving up some of the ideas on this DVD for future Halloween parties and get togethers. This is definitely a must have on your Martha Stewart Holiday Colletion!!!
4,Kiehl's Musk,I am a woman and I use Kiehl's Orignal Musk. I enjoy the smell of musk but most are too loud. This smell is light and fresh. I enjoy wearing it especially in warm months.
5,"The original blend, the brand's mark","Kiehl's classic star product, in the most convenient, practical presentation.Best if combined with the shower gel & the body lotion."
5,MY SIGNATURE,"i love this fragrance! after years of being a fragrance whore (literally, dozens...the money i could have in my account;() this the one i wear everyday. it is a bit heady but at the same time fresh and clean. i will occasionally wear marc jacobs or guerlain vetiver (gemini that i am, i have to mix it up once in awhile)."
3,eh . . .,"It's OK, wasn't as ""wowed"" as I thought I'd be. Doesn't seem to last very long, maybe I'm not using enough? And doesn't smell to me at all like the oil, which also doesn't seem to last very long."
4,Very sexy scent,"I love the way this Musk by Kiehl's makes my skin smell musky and sexy! Throughout the day, I spend a lot of time in the sun, and by the end of the day I can still smell my perfume! I live in Florida, and usually perfume sweats off of me, but this Musk lasts and lasts! It changes scent, too."
1,"I really wanted to love this, but...","I'm a musk fanatic! That being said, I came upon this item and based on the reviews, I was very excited to try it! Through a search, I found that it is available at a local department store, so rather than risk ordering it, I excitedly ventured out to the store for a test! My immediate reaction, was ""un-neutered ferret and male cat spray"" For those of you fortunate enough to have never smelled either, let me sum up in one word...YUCK!!! I thought the scent would improve after a bit, so I walked around, sniffing the pulse points of my wrists, hoping against all hope that after a few moments, I would be able to utter an ""ahhh"". Sadly, no such luck. The scent never improved and I couldn't wait to get home to shower. However, I decided to wait it out, still clinging to the hope the scent would magically improve. Hours later, I took that shower! Maybe it's my body chemistry because there are so many positive reviews, but for me, this was not good."
3,"great scent, poor packaging","I've been wanting to buy this cologne for a while now, and recently purchased this with a gift card. It arrived wrapped in bubble tape, but without the box it SHOULD come in. Granted, this was no big deal for me, as I bought it for myself and it hadn't been damaged during shipping, but if I had bought this as a gift for someone else, I would have wanted to know it would be sans box. To be perfectly honest, I thought it was illegal to sell beauty products without a box listing ingredients and whatnot + a safety seal, so it was all a little fishy to me. That said, the scent is as it should be, so I'm content."
5,Handbook for Mortals,I found this book days after leaving the hospital with a two year prognosis for a misdiagnosed illness. My head was spinning. I was making lists of questions and to do lists for leaving my 2 young children. Finding this book was a wonderful gift. It answered my questions and provided a realistic outlook for what to expect of a terminal condition. The book provides sample statements for calling your relatives and helps you to prepare for your doctor appointments. I visited a doctor today and I led the session and all of my questions were addressed before the exam occurred. This book should be recommended to all diagnosed with a terminal illness. Highly recommended book!
4,Handbook for Mortals- good reference for non-medical people.,"This is a very practical and ""user friendly"" guide for non-medical people to try to navigate the often difficult and long journey when someone they love is dying- even includes a section on children, babies, and even when there is a suicide.The last chapter is just references- sites that people can go to for specific illnesses and other resources. Very direct and down to earth- addresses issues most would rather avoid- pain, incontinence, etc. A forward by Rosalynn Carter states, ""We often put off in life what is important, and sometimes it takes the shadow of death to make us appreciate that love, family and faith are really things that matter."" Excellent resource."
4,A Must See,"A real Gem....everything works; extremely will directed with a strong cast that keeps you glued to the movie. Excellent example of an ""Indie"" as its finest. A well written musical score that works very well. This film won't disappoint. If you're a fan of ""Indie"" films a must see."
5,Well Done Supernatural Romantic Thriller,"Not really a Horror Film (by today's blood-n-guts standards). Even Redbox lists it as Drama. Acting was first rate. Story was ""out there"" but that's what I REALLY liked about it. Much better than I expected."
2,Good actors in a wacky story,"The cast does the best it can, but this story is just too wacky to believe or even to make the viewer suspend disbelief. A grieving woman who works in a hospital revives a dead man with a violent history and then the ghost of the house she is renting inhabits the body until the dead guy repo's his body. Did you get that?Um.....yeah."
2,Had promise but didn't quite make it,"I was in the mood for a good 2 1/2 star movie (sometimes they're just what you need), and rented this one. (As I write, it is out of stock on Amazon, it's the first day of the movie's release to DVD). The plot concept was interesting to me, but the movie is so implausible, that I ended up stopping it well before it was half over. Implausible even for a ghost movie? That's pretty implausible. And didn't mind the low-budget look, mostly refreshing actually, but shouldn't doctors wear badges and have stethoscopes? Liked the acting, though, and very realistic main character, Barbara."
4,Stick well,I can never seem to find all the spice names in one set but aside from that the words are easy to read and the labels stuck
1,Adhesive not good,I'm now looking for different labels. These aren't any good. I wouldn't order these. My jars are plastic if that makes a difference.
4,A Must Try,"The soap does exactly what its aid to do.Great results, cleaner skin and less acne. Noticable difference in the clearness of my skin. I reccomend a moisterizer for use after as well"
4,"Raptors ,Glorious Raptors","If you've read Palentologist Robert T Bakker's excellent book 'Raptor Red' ,your gonna love this.Aimed at the 'learning to read' market, it is however an excellent explorationof the Raptors world ,in a day to day living sense.Packed with illustrations & Bakker's excellent writing style , very soon youare living with this pack.At the same time the science is not lost & the evidence for his conclusionsare presented clearly.If only he would write more.Engaging for a 'learning to read' book , fascinating for a glimpse into thissupreme predators lifestyle.Chris D"
5,Accurate and fun information,This book gives good basic information on penguins in a very fun format. The poems are catchy. I teach 3-6 year olds and I caught them repeating the phrases they liked the best. I highly recommend it for this age group.
2,hmmm <yawn>,"This book started off with great promise. I liked the idea of the heroine being a ""pirate"" and the hero being rugged and not caring for the unfeminine ""lady"". But as the booked progressed it was loosely knit. The ""lady"" falling to quickly, the hero being obsessive about someone he dosent like.....ugh! I was disappointed."
3,"okay, not great","The book was ok, but not all that great. I just didn't really like the main characters all that much. The hero irritated me, and the book just was not that well written. It seemed to wrap up too quickly and the love the two characters suddenly felt seemed to come out of nowhere. It's ok to read if you're bored but you could find a better book."
1,For all different kind of HP cartridges...,"They can make a universal one for all printers... but they would rather make a special one for each series, and a new series every 6-9months, it is easy $ there."
2,"A classic, but more strange than I remember it being.","I remembered this being a classic from my childhood, and enthusiastically started reading it to my son. It starts out great, but ends so abruptly - I honestly started flipping the last page back and forth thinking I was missing half the book. There is no real ""end"" - the boy hates his sweater, argues with his family and teammates about it, and goes to church to pray that moths will eat it. The end. I'm left wondering why this was such a colossal childhood classic. The illustrations are fantastic, however, and my son was still interested in the story."
3,"Started out great, but the ending was odd","The story started out great. A little boy who wanted to be like his Hockey idol. He had always worn the same jersey for years, but this year his Mom bought him a jersey from a different team. He was not happy. But he wears the jersey anyway. The ending is what was weird. It was like it was missing some pages or something. It just didn't end well in my opinion."
4,Parental Review Required For This Great Story,Beware: this is not a fairy tail/happy ending book and should not be given directly to a child. Hockey loving parents/coaches should be familiar with this story before reading it to their sons/daughters/players.
2,blah ending,"what i thought would be a great book for my 2 hockey players ( ages 6 + 9), we were all dissapointed in the ending. the story builds as the boy is the only one with a different sweater from everyone else. Instead of something great happening to him, it ends with him in church praying that moths eat the sweater. period , thats the end. not very inspirational for your kids. want a great hockey book? get ""The Magical Hockey Stick"" its great!"
5,Teach the World a Lesson,I am not a big reader to start with. My English teacher recommended I read this book. I was the most wonderful book. I would tell everyone to read it. I loved it so much I went on and read The Wave by Strasser. Which was great too. I think Strasser has a wonderful way for getting a tough issue across and effectively. He teaches a lesson that needs to get across. Give a boy a Gun is written in a unique way that really connects you to the book in a way I have never felt before. There are even gun facts on the bottom of each page. This is an intense book that makes you think. It should be on everyone's most read list.
3,Give a boy a gun,"The book Give a Boy a Gun I thought was a very interesting book which I liked. It was weird to see how this book was similar to my life and most high scholar's lives. It also showed many lessons including that you should never pick on anyone without expecting anything back and also that everyone should treat others equally. It was also a hard book to put down since there was always something new to read about and you never really never knew what was going to happen next.I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It would be especially good for high scholars and teachers since it shows everyday occurrences in high school. It is a good book to read in class since it will teach kids to not pick on others and it is a quick, good read. I would not recommend this book to kids younger than high school since it does involves guns and shootings."
4,A creative perspective,A creative fictional piece in which the author views the happening of the events from many different characters. This book convinces children and teenagers today to stop the bullying and discrimination to prevent school shootings.
4,Great Book for Teens,"Give A Boy A Gun is agreat book for teens and young adults. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of ten. This book is great for teens for two reasons. First, it is just like real life. The author expresses the feelings of the teens in this book perfectly. Their feelings are very clear and their actions make sense. Second, there is plenty of action and suspense. In case you didn't know already, two teenagers(Gary Searle and Brendan Lowler) bring guns to a dance and hold sixty people hostage. Even though you know that they are both going to die it still keeps you guessing. This is why Give A Boy A Gun is a great book for teens."
4,gripping and original,"This book begins with a graphic description of what happens when a bullet enters a brain. Like Columbine, it is the story of two outsiders who plot then carry through a grisly revenge on their fellow students who tormented them. Teachers, parents and other students from prom queens to geeks all are given space to recap the school shooting for the reader. The sense of alienation and confusion these people feel comes through clearly. It is an original way of exploring what might make two seemingly ordinary suburban teenagers ""snap."""
4,Very Good Book On School Violence,"From reading this book, I have to say that it's a very good book about school violence, even to the point that there a little tidbits about Columbine, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in the book(but not in the story itself) that jolts you(although sometimes it did confuse me a little of whether this book is fiction or not) and it looks into the mind of everyone who was involved in this incident and I recommendmend this book to everyone(particularly to certain school districts and administrators in CO)."
4,Good Book With a Good Message,"A 14 year old readerOpinion:--The book was good; it showed the way kids react when they grow up in a violent world. It also displays a good message to show the feelings of the kids who are not in the ""in crowd""--It is also interesting hearing the perspective of the two boys from more than one character. That added an interesting layer to the books formayt.--One aspect that was confusing was the facts that were printed on the bottom of each page. Although they were interesting, they were also distracting to the plot.Recommendation:--This book is enjoyable and an easy read. This book should be suggested and/or mandatory to all middle school and junior high students. This book teaches a valuable lesson of respecting others whether they are like you or not. Overall a great book * * * * ( 4/5 star)"
4,Give a Boy a Gun,"""Give a Boy a Gun"" is a great book. Gary and Brendan are two suicidal teenagers who get bullied every day by football players and kids on the restling team. These boys attempt to reenact what happened at Columbine. Other than Gary, no one was killed in the shooting scene. Gary shot himself and Brendan ended up in a mental institution for the rest of his life. This was definately one of the best books that I have ever read. I sincerely think you should read it."
3,Great book but not enough info,"Give a boy a gun is an excellent book but it's almost impossible to get any other info on the event its about besides what is given in the book! It never said whether or not one of the main characters died or not & i can't seem to find this out. GRRRR its so frustrating! anyways, besides that the book is pretty good except that it can be hard to keep track of all the people in it. It also didn't say as much as it couldv'e about the things that happened during the shooting..."
4,weird but cool,Gary and brendan were definatly screwed up. This story followes their life through the stories of others. This book is really creppy because you see some kids like this at your school and think are they capable of doing this? it really changes the way you look at people. i would recomend this to kids who are looking for a great book
4,Keep guns away from kids!!!,"Two boys with the same interests and are a little different from everyone else. Well in this town in the book ""Give a Boy a Gun"" by Todd Strasser that won't pass. Just because they don't play football or atleast go to the games they are made fun of at school by the kids who do. Brenden and Gary are both interested in the same things like gory games, guns, drugs and alcohol. The guns part doesn't come in until later though. Also the other thing the two have in common is that they are both picked on at school. They both get so fed up with it. They get guns from neighbors houses and booby-trap a school dance. Then it all begins what they do at the dance and how it all turns out. To find out this information i will leave it up to you to read the book and find out. I highly recommend it."
3,Interesting,"This book was a very eye-opening expereince. I think it would be great to teach in a classroom, maybe with a unit on bullying.The book is written in a very different style that some students may love but others may hate.I personally was not fond of how it was written but I can still see the merit of it."
4,Give a Boy a Gun,"This book was very extreme, and completely addictive and thought-provoking. From the way it's written from many different people's point of view as flashbacks, and to the footnotes of interesting information on school shootings, this entire book just makes you wonder about how violent our country is becoming. This book is really short, so it's a fast read, but it will probably stick with you for awhile after you read it because of the seriousness of the subject."
1,Worst book I've ever read.,"Strasser has almost no writing talent whatsoever. His characters are flat and stereotypical and the entire book is meant only to push his political agenda. I recommend reading a book with actual character development and real emotion, not written by someone using events and the lives of teens to preach an agenda through heavily manipulated facts. Strasser is a snake at best."
1,Michael Moore is missing a member of his writing staff.,This book is so full of twisted facts and flat out lies I almost vomitted. Apparently everyone who rated this book above 2 stars either is completely inept at noticing propaganda or agrees with Strasser's BS. Strasser definatley stole a page out of Michael Moore's play book on this one. What better way to twist facts and impose and agenda than using the murders of school children and exploiting their suffering.
1,"By a stupid liberal, for stupid liberals.","Here we go again. A liberal tries to subtly state his case and covince others to become advocates against guns and the second amendment in general. Lies. Manipulation. That's what this guy's resorting to. Don't you people know a gun can't control someone, influence their actions? ""Give a boy a gun."" The title implies the weapons themselves convinced the boys to do evil things. That's the problem with you liberals. Just because something's a weapon, doesn't mean it has to kill, or harm. There are many sporting, defensive and recreational applications for guns. Guns don't kill people, losers with guns kill people. ""Give a boy a gun."" Ha! This book is the embodiment of an idiotic principle. Just a way to rally anti-gun advocates. Foul."
5,It's awesome,"This book was incredibly good. It takes you inside the mind of two boys who are planning a school shooting by talking to their friends, family, and the people that made their lives a living hell. I really think schools should make this a mandatory read. Many kids are picked on by the popular crowd. Depending on who they are, it can make them tick and want to get revenge. Unfortunately, I was made fun of a lot during my middle school years, and let me tell you, it's no fun. I hope everyone learns a valuable lesson from this book: TOLERATE DIFFERENCE!! These kids were different from the ""popular"" crowd which made them easy targets. Some people have shorter fuses than others and above all NO ONE DESERVES TO BE BULLIED. If people could just read this book and learn that tolerance could easily prevent these shootings, it would make a world of difference. Alright before I go and get tooo mr. rogers on you....go buy the book! You won't regret it."
4,Nice jersey and it made a great gift,This jersey was bought as a gift. I had planned to buy a Warriors jersey so I checked it out before giving it away. The quality is nice and I ended up buying one with similar quality. The Swingman version is a nice medium between the Authentic and Replica versions. I found Replicas to feel and look cheap while the Authentics are very nice but too expensive.
5,"This book offers ""proof"" of a global conspiracy",This is Griffin's first book in a series that attempts to document the existence of a political global conspiracy. Griffin makes a convincing argument. Everyone should evaluate the information in this book for themselves. References and citations are plentiful in this powerful and important work. It is absoultely a MUST for those interested in world politics . . . even if you believe conspiracy theories to be lunacy!
2,Interesting but pay attention to the documenation,"I read this book a few years ago and was impressed with the history and documentation. However the author includes a chapter on how the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church is really a coven of satan-worshippers. The other chapters have footnotes and ways to corroborate. The ""cardinals"" chapter had nothing. (This sort of thing can turn away people from continuing to seek out the truth when they find an obvious statement of prejudice in the middle of it). Read the book but use it to follow up with more reputable resources."
2,A bit unhappy,"This is damn near a wonderful flashlight.But not quite.The thing is, this is a tremendously bright flashlight on the main setting, and the red led is very useful if you want to use it close up without being blinded. It's also VERY lightweight, and comes with a decent belt holster.However, mine is malfunctioning. Within two weeks of purchase, it got stuck in signal mode. It still basically functions, it's just obnoxious to use.Also, the pocket clip is terrible. It's poorly designed and poorly fitted. The tip of the pocket clip doesn't flare out enough so it's rather difficult to clip to a pocket, and there's several mm of clearance between the tip and the body of the light. Retention is very poor, and it functions more like a pocket hook than a pocket clip.LRI's warranty is fairly good, and they said they'd fix/replace the light and fit a new pocket clip, but I am unable to send it back at this time."
4,Pretty Good - But older model?,I am overall pretty impressed with the product for the money. However I'm pretty sure I recieved the older model other reviewers have discussed. Also holding it up against another 100 Lumen light I have it is not that bright. The thread on the one I received also is not great and when screwing the battery compartment closed sometimes the o-ring pinches and bulges out a little - if this was something I had to do a lot I'd be pretty annoyed - fortunately it's good on batteries.Don't get me wrong this is an EDC light for me and I'm using it a lot. I like the switching mech especially the straight to red (main reason I got it) option by holding the button down. It also is definately waterproof as I has tested this - just make sure the o-ring is seated properly.
3,WARNING! THIS IS THE OLDER 100 LUMENS VERSION,"I ordered this and got the old discontinued (100 lumens) model. I don't want that - I assumed I was getting the 115 lumens model because I already own one. Also, this web listing does not mention the lumens at all. The 115 lumens is much brighter than the old. Keep ""scrollling"" down the various ""lists"" and you'll see the new one at 115 lumens is available. What nerve, trying to pawn off a discontinued model on me. I immediately sent it back to Amazon."
1,Rip-off alert!,"Beware: the picture on the box is a still of Anouk Aimee in Jacques Demy's 1962 ""Lola"". The disc is a transfer of a 1970 film of the same name with Charles Bronson - as, in fact, described in the synopsis below for more careful shoppers than I was in a moment of haste. Even if the Bronson film is the one you want, get a different transfer. This one is blurry and awful in every way, including no menu, let alone any other features. So: a false-advertising image for a woefully substandard (other) product. I chalk this one up to experience - which I pass on to others."
1,Why was this made into audio book,"I can't imagine why anyone would publish this book in audio format. The story is told in first person and the character telling the story is an incredible whiner. The narrator makes a worthy effort at trying to put some spine into his voice but the author has created a spineless, insecure, overweight character who snivels throughout the book. What was Hammond Innes thinking?"
3,Something seems to be missing!,This toy was not as exciting on its own as we may have thought. It is hard to assemble and the tracks break away from each other as my children play with it so it leads to frustration if I am not there to fix it right away. My kids did not play with it much until I connected it to other take along play sets (although it drives my daughter nuts when my son pushes Thomas the tank engine on the Dora tracks). It was almost too basic and lacked details that could have made it a good dramatic play item by itself. The castle does not hold the tracks and is generally awkward so it really cannot be transported without putting it into a bag or box. Overall it seemed to be missing key elements that would make it a great toy!
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","I guess you get what you pay for. This item comes with a variety of adapters, none of which properly fit my Aspires (I have two of them). Every time I moved the cord would pull slightly putting the laptop to battery and then back to AC. After a while something broke and the tip of the adapter actually melted inside a laptop and it took a lot of effort to get it back out. While it looks like others have had success with this product, I found it to be complete garbage."
3,"Item is OK for the price, but mine did not last too nlong","Item is OK for the price, but mine did not last too long. I bought on January 13, 2012 but right now is not working any longer. I will order another one, to see how it goes."
1,Power cord Acer,"Purchased this in December as a replacement for the original power supply. The ""new"" power supply has now broken....lasted 3 months. The first one lasted 2 years."
2,Short life,"After using the item about a weekThe unit start work irradically,,have to shake it before it works,,then sudden ly quick work all together."
2,Not as pictured.,"I was looking for an adapter with the 2 pole ac plug, not bulky and easily interchanged with a 2 pole european power cord. The idea was to have an alternative to the clumsy acer wall wart.What I got was a 3 pole power plug and a fat three pole power cord, makes the whole thing nearly twice as bulky as what's pictured. Won't store in my netbook pouch with its cord."
5,Works for more than what was displayed.,"If you have an Aspire 5552 This adapter will work as well. I've been using both my original and this replacement adapter and both are going strong. Of course only time will tell how long the off market adapter will work but so far so good, at the very least it's well worth the $10 I payed for it. Also, it should be noted that this connection has a straight end instead of an L shape that my original adapter came with. This is not so much a problem but it's something to get used to if you are used to having your computer against something on that side."
3,Keeps the cold air out,"It does a good job keeping the cold air out but it is not a true replacement for the old weather stripping. From the picture it looked like it would be perfect but when I received it I found the part that gets stuffed into the groove was too small in diameter. It just falls out. I stapled it in place but I am looking for weather stripping with the right diameter on the holding arm (.375""). The display doesn't show what the appropriate groove width should be. That is important."
2,Budget Sticks,"I purchase a brick of these sticks hoping to find a cheaper pair of sticks since these sticks we made by Vic Firth, I assumed they would be good. After playing for a few weeks I am down to my last 3 pairs, I'm beginning to see why these are ""Budget"" drum sicks, as I broke and average of on pair, every time i got behind the kit. Unless you don't play any hard or heavy kind of music I as a professional Drummer do not recommend these sticks. Save you money and get the better model of sticks."
3,shipping costs too high!,"The candy itself is very good, but way overpriced. Plus, the shipping costs are almost 50% of the price of the candy."
5,"Excellent Series, Highly Entertaining!","Hustle is an incredible story of four men and a woman who all happen to be con artists. They use different scenarios in each con with the sole intent of separating greedy individuals from their money. The have a strict code they live by and follow the maxim that ""you can't cheat an honest man"". The bonus features include interviews with the writers, directors and cast members to give you a complete understanding of this terrific story. Well worth the time and investment for my library."
3,"...only closed captions, no subtitles","Hello,being from Germany I am always looking for an ""original"" DVD on which the episodes were not cut. The German edition is cut and the British is said to have been in the beginning at least, too. Furthermore there are no subtitles at all on the British edition. Hopefully I ordered the uncut version here but the so called subtitles are ""closed captions"" only which are not common in Europe.So from my point of view shame on all publishers and also on Amazon which claimed that there are subtitles not ""closed captions"". At the moment I am looking for a codefree DVD-Player with ""closed captions"" feature but I fear that this will be very difficult here in Germany. The only solution so far is to watch the DVDs on the PC with PowerDVD that is able to resolve ""closed captions"".Best RegardsJuergen"
1,Overrated,"...The characters are not likeable, the plot is trite and boring, and Heinlein uses the same devices over and over that I could probably have written the last quarter of the book for him...If you are younger than 40, or have grown up since the 60's, you'll realize that Stranger in a Strange Land was the N'Sync of its time."
1,"Dull, dull, dull and stupid","I can't believe I managed to finish reading this tripe. Basically as others have said, the first half was an intriguing idea. The second half however shows what a simplistic world view Heinlein had.The Plot: Basically martian man begins a Scientology/Branch Davidians cuasi-socialist-cult where everybody melts into one entity and becomes happy by freeing their mind and having sex, lots of sex. Who gives a (blip) anyway. All this is explained in long-winded conversations where one idiot makes a comment only to be refuted by an all wise sage, and the sage is never wrong.Boring, boring, boring as hell. If Heinlein had any sense of irony he would have seen that martian man's cult was utter stupidity and would have made fun of it in the last half.Don't buy this book, get something that matters."
2,"Interesting, Dated, Marred by Chauvinism and Prejudice","It's easy to understand why this novel made a splash in the 1960s (before the advent of ""free love"") and its harsh criticism of many contemporary religious practices is astute and rings true. But ""Stranger"" generally seems very, very dated, the dialogue is atrocious and often painful to read, and Heinlein's disdain for women and unflattering asides about gays, Jews and Muslims is indefensible. ""Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's at least partly her own fault"" one of the lead characters, Jill, explains to Mike (the Man From Mars). Really? Perhaps if Heinlein's mother, wife or daughter had been raped, Jill would have felt differently. ""Stranger,"" written in 1960, hasn't aged well at all and, especially in its 60,000-extra-word ""original and uncut"" version, must be viewed today as a major disappointment."
1,What a waste of time,"Alternate title for my review comes from the female protagonist Jill, one of the ""girls"" in Jubal's merry household. ""Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault."" p.s. thanks to the reviewer who revealed the ending - now I can quit this mess."
4,We Could All Learn a Few Things From this Book,"This books gives you the view of the Earth from the viewpoint of a new arrival -- a human who was raised on Mars.What a great concept. You can help but to see some of the insanity that passes for normal in this culture.Heinlein has an uncanny ability to get you into the head of the characters -- you feel like you are with them in some of the most unusual situations -- actually feeling their emotions. I was definitely moved in many parts of the book.Although somethings are depicted as future, there was a lot of 'familiar' too. So for those who do not consider themselves to be 'SF' fans, I think you will find this book one you can relate to and will enjoy.It is a classic in the genre, and if you have not yet read it, you really should.I was impressed by the depth of Heinlein's imagination. I actually read this book years ago and it left a lasting impression on me. You Grok?"
5,A true classic,"There are some that haven't read this book. Luckily if you're reading this you are already interested. Great plot, great writing and a true classic. Go on and read it!"
2,"Starts great, falls apart","This is a review of the uncut version. This story begins very well, and develops as a very intriguing sci-fi thriller, with an unusual sense of empathy.Half way through Part 3. though, it veers into a strange psychological treatise on sexuality, religion, family and cult life and Part 4. is hopelessly meandering, unreal and verbose. I regret reading the uncut version as I'm sure the editing made for an improved version with more focus.It seems as though the author put the book down for a prolonged period of writer's block and when he finally came back, the story went way off course. He should have opted for some swift interplanetary warfare for a much better ending."
3,"""A historical artifact""","A groundbreaking novel for its time, which is still interesting as a historical curio. The story of the last survivor of an expedition to Mars, and his return to Earth, the book was a 1960s counter-cultural sensation at the time but today also reads like a relic of the Madmen mindset. I read it back in highschool based on my love of some of his earlier books, like puppet masters and tunnel in the sky. I liked it fine although I didn't quite grasp the underlying political message back then."
2,The only thing I can say is know your statistics,"This book was 4.5/5 when last I checked. There is no possible way that if you polled those readers who have read many of Heinlein's other books, or Hugo watchers, or those readers who are scifi specialists with specific tastes -- cyberpunks, techno buffs, socio-political buffs, other-worlders, etc., that you would get past 3/5. Caveat emptor: this book has serious potential to annoy unless you know you like Heinlein's FULL range of novels."
1,Would not have finished except stuck on a plane.,"I picked up the book because I was interested in the premise, but reading the book drained any interest out of me. If you can get past the sexism (one female character says 90% of women who are raped are partly responsible) the story is OK. But once it dives off into the religious end forget it. Heinlein has some good ideas but there is so much else to trudge through that I could never suggest someone else read this. I think I read in one review it was one of the few best pieces of sci-fi. If it is I'm giving up sci-fi. Go read Asimov or Gibson."
1,No Way to Treat Women or Maritans,"I was very disappointed in this book and I couldn't wait to finish it. I was tempted several times to give up in the middle, but I read so many positive reviews, I wanted to push on to see what I was missing. I conclude that I am not a fan of science fiction, although I love the movies of the 1950s. I found the story line (plot) to be rather confusing. There was too much philosophical preaching and innane comments by Jubal and his cast of players. I felt sorry for Michael and wished more of his character had been developed. The book was very long and jumped to places that didn't make sense to me. Much of the language and attitude toward women is completely unacceptable."
3,Looking back I see it differently,"I read this book multiple times in high school as part of a group of friends that were seeking deeper meaning, more love and understanding, an alternative to mainstream culture...this book fed those yearnings. The premise of the outsider seeing everything for the first time certainly lends itself to social commentary. I was disappointed to pick it up recently and discover gender roles that I didn't pick up on at the time, that now seem antiquated and outrageous. As a matter of fact I couldn't make it through the book."
5,Better than the original,"The publication of the uncut version was a great blessing. It is just as readable as (perhaps more readable than) the original, heavily edited version. A lot of little things make more sense in the uncut version, and you get a much better understanding of what Heinlein was trying to convey."
3,"Perhaps a little 'old fashioned', but interesting!","The book could be considered a little out of date, so far as our modern, sophisticated writing styles are concerned.However, I enjoy it. A friend mentioned it as something he enjoyed 40 years or so ago. It kind of demonstrates how we have advanced in our perceptions of things!"
5,Stranger in a Strange Land-Robert A. Heinlein,"This book is the undabridged version, which Robert A. Heinlein originally submitted to his editor. There were many cuts made and the book was published in the abridged version. Recently, I learned that Mr. Heinlein's wife had the unabridged version printed and went looking for this version, which I found on Amazon. Thanks, Amazon, for making it so easy to find this book."
4,A must-read for sci-fi fans!,"If you're looking for a great sci-fi story ""Stranger"" is your best bet. It's a thorough, adventurous, suspensful, not to mention, funny documentation of a Martian's life on Earth. If you haven't read this, you haven't read sci-fi"
4,2 books in 1,"This really did feel like at least 2 books in one.The first part is good old fashioned sci-fi, and the second part is theological and moralistic diatribe. I didnt care for the second part as much, even though I agreed with quite a bit of it, it still felt preachy. I can handle that type of deal better also, when it is more subtly woven into the fabric of the story. This was just handled a bit heavy handed.Still I can see why it is considered one of the all time greats. This is a must read for anyone who is a real hardcore fan of the genre."
5,Stranger In A Strange Land,"This is possibly one of the most unique sci-fi/fantasy books that I have ever read. This is coming from a 15 year old who read this book for an English assignment. However, despite your age, sex, etc... I can assume that if you like sci-fi, this will be a find for you. Through Mike and Jubal, Heinlein paints a web in which you will question life as you know it. You will begin to 'grok' new meanings in society and of life itself. I would definately recommend this book to anyone, as long as you don't mind decently sad endings and don't get too uptight about religion. I shall leave you with one of my favorite quotes, ""Waiting is."""
2,Mindless Proselytizing...,"I am a fan of Heinlein. Really. I loved some of his other works. But I purchased the audio version of Stranger in a Strange land and found it to be tedious in the extreme. Endless preaching about the glories of ""Foster,"" free-love and sex with many, many, available, willing young women (its amazing how these nubile women seem to fall all over the male characters. And the women are all completely unjealous of each other. Where are the harems of men for the female characters?) This novel read like a Gor book. Where is the action? And I don't mean that sort!I also really hated the narration and the monotonous voice the narrator used for Michael Smith. He sounded like a little boy.Overall, some of his other sci-fi is better than this. This book was nothing more than a soapbox for Heinlein to preach his personal life philosophy. I might be able to overlook this, if there was an actual plot as well. Unfortunately, no such luck. Ech."
3,658 reviews here already!,"Nobody probably read the previous version so I have no problem to modify it a lot. I truly enjoyed the first segment of the book (with Jubal the main protagonist) - probably because I am now in his age group.Being old and an agnostic (more or less like Jubal), I was unable to read the sex stuff (of no interest at my age) and the religious stuff (deadly boring).So, I am reducing the original 5 stars to three - this is still a 'classic' that introduced the verb 'to grok' into English language outside science fiction but I would probably enjoy contemporary standard police stories from California more. Too much philosophy by Heinlein can get bit tiresome. Educational, though, for people about 40 -50 years younger than I."
4,Still a classic after all these years,"I haven't read Stranger in a Strange Land for many years. I was as good as I remember. Some of the references we archaic but it still has power to enchant the reader. It really makes you think about how the world deals with beliefs different than the norm. As always Heinlein is a master story teller. This books should be on every Science Fiction readers list. If you haven't read it, read it now."
4,A worhty read,"I decided my previous review of this book was too harsh, criticizing it for it's (what I deemed to be) sexist views. After giving it more thought I would recommend this book because I think it gives the reader a lot to think about and reveals a lot of truths about our own society. In the character of Michael Valentine, Heinlein creates a completely refreshingly innocent man untouched by humanity's greatest downfalls as a result of having been raised by Martians, who are unlike human beings in every way, even down to their lack of religion and their sexuality. Through Michael we get the chance to view our own world (albeit in a fictional future) in a way that causes us to open our eyes and question things we take for granted.Having looked at the book from a different point of view, I can forgive its imperfections and appreciate it for what the author was able to accomplish with his distinct and well-merited skills."
2,Stranger in a Strange Land,I would not have finished this if it had not been one of our book club selections. Most of the club members liked it. I did not. It did lead to some very good discussion questions though.
5,Must-Read,"I won't add any spoilers... I hate when reviews do such. But I will say that this book should definitely be read. It is a story that has no boundary of time and is still just as good now as it was a decade ago, 2 decades ago, and beyond. I recommend this book to everyone."
2,Lost in time,"The allure of Stranger in a Strange Land departed with the allure of the free-love lifestyle that the book's protagonist espouses. All that's left is a half-interesting, if disturbing, glimpse into the mindset of the sixties and an imaginative, but underdeveloped, science fiction story.There are some timeless lessons here about being an authentic person, committing to one another, and being open to the views of others. The power of those lessons, however, is vastly diminished by their placement next to non-titanic philosophical issues like the value of nakedness and bathing and sleeping with as many as you can in the name of love (but only if they are your water brother).Must admit that it is fun to see what we thought high-tech would be in the future when viewed from the 60's. It makes you wonder what we'll come up with in the future that we haven't envisioned yet."
2,"Unbelievable dialog, endless essays","agree with a lot of points in other 1-2 star reviews, reread after 24 years, book is just out dated as hell and the characters are paperthin stereotypes for the most part.Was anyone else annoyed by the extreme number of lines of dialog that start with ""Uh ..."" in this book?"
3,Super Reader,"Michael Smith is a child born in space, because of a manned mission to Mars from Earth. The Martians raise him on their planet, and he gains unique psionic abilities because of this upbringing.When he returns to Earth he looks at things very differently to the locals, and basically straights preaching a new religion. When that happens, lots of people will get upset, particularly when it is of the love and shag all you like variety."
5,"Excellent, classic, Heinlein, but read the original version.","The original, ""cut"" version is my preference in this classic Heinlein, rather than the re-issued version released after his death. Some important concepts in the book are changed substantially with the addition of the originally-cut material, in my opinion."
2,Just very odd......,"This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the ""intelligent conversation"" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered ""well read."" Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from ""To Kill A Mockingbird."""
4,"Interesting story, but a bit too intellectual","I will keep this brief: lots of people seem to love this book to death. I enjoyed it but parts of it were tedious. The book requires a lot of thinking. I consider myself to be of above-average intelligence but at times it took a lot of perserverance to finish. It was worth reading, but it isn't my favourite Heinlein book."
5,Thou art god.,"This book burrows into the mind and questions every ""truth""held dear to us. This book made me rethink every idea I wasbrought up with, from the sacredness of religion, to thesanctity of marriage, and the point of life itself. Itdefines some of the most elusive subjects of any time.What is Love? What is being alive? It is a biting satireon our society and it really makes you think. And if that'snot enough, it's a compelling and entertaining story."
3,long,"I may have enjoyed the cut version more. Sure, this version may be more explicit, but it gets long at times. The plot and characters' development is exciting for the first couple parts, but then things get repetitive and stagnant. Lots of thought-provoking stuff, particularly out of Jubal Harshaw, but again it gets long-winded at times. An important book historically for sci-fi, so worth a look."
3,Stranger in a Strange Land,"I was bored within the first 50 pages. It arrived in excellent condition and in a timely fashion, to be used it's definitely in superb condition. I will try reading it again, it's just not my taste, has nothing to do with the book itself"
5,Great,Great book. A classic for any lover of sci fi or even a lover of philosophy. An absolute must read.
3,Wrong edition sent,Seller sent wrong edition. I ordered the 1991 unedited edition and received a 1961 edited version. I did not return it because a friend wanted to read that edition. I will try again later.Joel Curry
4,Entertaining if a bit preachy,"Heinlein does not pull punches. He tells you exactly what he thinks about a number of things up to and including evangelists in this entertaining book. It is not really science fiction, but rather a fish out of water observing the human comedy as an outsider. The fact that Valentine Michael Smith was raised by Martians is a quaint notion today, but it doesn't matter if he's a Martian or an orphan raised by wolves. It allows Heinlein to step outside humanity.Some of his points you'll find infuriating, some of them will ring a positive chord. But mostly it's presented in a way to make you think rather than to influence you (the end goes a little overboard in preachiness, but it's not too irritating).Most importantly, it is not dated. The issues it comments on are still relevant today. And it is presented as a highly entertaining story! So kick back and enjoy this book."
4,"I forgot I was reading science fiction, not sociology.","The most enjoyable moments for me were ususally found in the character's dialouge. Jubal Harshaw, although being a doctor and a lawyer, was entertaining and to me relateable on his views of politics and religion, which were depicted more as villiany than anything else. While not quite as eventfull as I would have prefered, Stranger In A Strange Land is still a wonderfull piece of work."
3,It's obvious that Heinlen has all the solutions,"Hmmm...let's see. According to Heinlen, all it takes for a communist, free-love type of society to function perfectly is an unlimited pool of cash and the development of psychic powers! Why didn't we think of this before? The idea that people actually set up communes based on this book makes me ill. Still, it's a compelling story, when the reader is allowed not to be overwhelmed by Heinlen's sledgehammer of philosophy."
3,I grok wrongness,"This book started out fantastic, and then ended with a bunch of hogwash. So many people enjoyed this book that I see no reason why you shouldn't try it out, you'll never know if you are one of those people touched by this book. I wasn't one of them."
2,"an overrated, overly cerebral mess","No, I didn't like 'Stranger in a Strange Land'. The story of a human raised on Mars returning to Earth to teach us all love and compassion is, well, almost too sappy and dull for words. To be fair the premise is good, and the book starts off rather nicely. But maybe one hundred pages in the author seems to dispense with any character development or action and simply has endless touchy-feely free love narratives. Honestly, upon reflection I really found this book to be rather awful.Bottom line: a bogus science fiction classic. I want my money back."
2,On the edge of boredom,"A frustrating book, in that it was not a page turner but just interesting enough not to put it down for good. I was on the edge of boredom throughout. Creating interesting, believable aliens is a great challenge for science fiction, which the author finesses by using a human raised by aliens as a central character. Some readers apparently see in this book a philosophical depth that escapes me. I only see it as mediocre entertainment."
2,Overrated Heinlein,"This is one of the most overrated ""classics"" I have ever read. What is Heinlein's trip with pontificating old men? I read ""I Will Fear No Evil"" and the ""old man"" character sucked in that book, too. The meaningless banter between all of the characters throughout the entire story was really tiring. I was told to read this book by many people, and I am sad to say that this""classic"" really disappointed me. Its not that I find the novel sexist, it's just that, after a while, the story just seemed really stupid."
4,Re- Reading An Old Favorite,"I am in the process of re reading one of my favorites from years Ago. It seems new to me again as I forgot so much dtails of the story.It is funny how Mike, Man from Mars learns to relate to Earthlings, and how the comunications take form.I sure like Heinline, he was before his time, like ayn Rand (Atlas Shrugged)So I wwill pursue my grokking for tonight!!! Thanks Amazon"
3,Lost interest,"I think the book started off very well and was pretty exciting. However, after 128 pages, I found that it just wasn't holding my attention much anymore. I wasn't so much bothered by what the author was trying to express through his writing, I was just bothered that he took so much time doing it. I have read other reviews for the book and it looks like not a whole lot more is going to change.I'm not saying this book is terrible and you shouldn't read it. Some people obviously like it. I'm just saying that for me personally, it was pretty boring."
1,Sci-fi classic? Hardly!,"I have just about finished this book and I am having immense trouble getting through the last few pages. I, like many others, started reading this book because of its ""Classic""-ness. The following line from the newest Ace version of the book was spoken by Jill, a major female character:""Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault.""What the heck is that?!?! How could ANY responsible author write such trash?!?! I almost put the book down...into the garbage can, but for some reason I didn't.This book is horribly dated and just oozes chauvanism out every pore. Even the strongest females are weak and subservient. It is disgusting reading a supposed sci-fi author who has been canonized by so many putting out trash like this.Why don't you just give John Norman the Nebula or Hugo while you're at it?"
1,Victim of a strange book,"For anyone who who admires and appreciates the great SF writer Robert Heinlein for his earlier books (written beofre this one), ""Stranger In a Strange Land "" will be at least unexpected, probably bewildering and quite possibly unenjoyable. The book is a thorough departure from classics such as Starship Troopers and represents a black line drawn across RH;s writing career.Before ""Stranger,"" few if any of his books were anything but good; after ""Stranger,"" few of his books were anything but bad, at least for fans of classic Heinlein.""Stranger's"" free-love message did well with the '60s hippie culture, but if you're looking for another Starship Troopers or Glory Road, you're looking in the wrong place."
2,vastly over-rated,"Stranger than Robert Heinlein's protagonist is that anyone takes this author seriously at all. Clearly, this is Heinlein's best book, but that is saying very, very little. If you haven't read Heinlein and you think for some--strange--reason you ought to, start here: then stop. (Okay, 2 and 1/2 stars.)"
2,"Weak story, naive backdrop","I'm not much of a Heinlein fan, and finally read this book for the first time since it is a 'classic'. In a word, it's dull. While The Moon is a Harsh Mistress at least has an entertaining narrative style and protagonist, Stranger is told in meandering third person. The book cascades from one small-and-easily-surmounted challenge to the next (only the first of the book's five parts has any real tension), with plenty of implied sex along the way. Heinlein's presentation of female empowerment while still treating them like sex objects is creepy. And as always his notion of free enterprise and the self-reliant man is naive at best, self-serving at worst. Smith's adjustment to his human heritage is the book's high point, although it doesn't wear well 40 years later."
5,My all time favourite book,Hard for me to grok that people would actually give this masterpiece only 1 star.
3,I grew up with this book,"My first reading of 'Stranger' was at 12 y.o.; I found the first half of the book great, the second half boring. I reread it in high school at 16, and, of a sudden, the second half (the sexy part) wasn't boring at all; it became my favorite book, bar none. In college, I read it yet again, and found it a lot of sexist, Whorfian linguistic hooey.If you at all care about science fiction, by all means, read it yourself. Your reaction may be all, some or none of the above. But don't pick it up thinking it's deeply philosophical, worthy of being taken very seriously. A great read, with Heinlein stock characters and ideas, which seems very much a child of its time 40 years on."
5,Philosophical breakthrough,"The writing style of the book may not be the best in history - everything about it is extremely well done, butwhat was striking to me, so many years ago, when I read this book, was a philosophy which to me made such perfect sense.It conflicted with my spiritual dogmas as a person, & I disagreed with it for that reason alone: the concept of free love. As presented within this book, I could not refute rationally.I was tempted to read more such books, defused from abandoning them to protect myself from impure ideas by one of the main character's challenges (paraphrased) ""It is hard to be religious when you've read as many books as I."" I knew the truth stood on its own stilts, & needn't be protected by ignorance."
5,Just plain incredible,"Stranger in a Strange Land is a Heinlein novel. Really, its Heinlein doing what he does best: being Heilein. Here, in distilled concentrated form is the philosophy that Heilein brings into all his other novels. The book is not really about the plot or characters at all, but more about the author's personal philosophy and the modern world (as he saw it so many years ago).If you don't like Heinlein, Stranger probably won't make you a believer. If you do like Heinlein, read it. If you haven't read Heinlein yet, don't start with this book. Start with something lighter and funner, like ""Cat Who Walks Through Walls"" or one of his fun young adult books like ""Podkayne of Mars"", or if your into longer books ""Time Enough for Love""I really liked this book, but its not going to win over people nor is it a good place to start reading Heinlein."
5,Sci-Fi giving directions to human race. Amazing !,"""Stranger"" is above all, a great lesson for each of us. No more standards, no more patterns. Author's faith in love is above all. No prejudices or social controls. What a world... Masterpiece"
2,I never could see what the fuss was about.,"I thought that this book was, at best, mediocre. It is written more or less at about a 9th grade level. The characters don't act like real people, and they are all given to long windy speeches about all sorts of things. The characters are all given to going off on windy, whiny recitations of Heinlein's beliefs on this or that subject. The ""Jubal"" character in particular never shuts up. I wanted to shoot him by the time I had finished the novel.Although this book has gotten considerable acclaim from certain quarters, no doubt due to its counterculture message, I personally found it to be a bore. Heinlein has written other, better novels (e.g. Starship Troopers) which offer superior alternatives to this one.Not recommended."
3,Not my favorite Heinlein,"I picked up this book after reading, and enjoying (once absolutely ADORING) some of his other works.Honestly, I had a hard time getting into it. Once I was into it I was underwhelmed for many of the reasons already stated here.If you've read this and no other Heinlein, pick up The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. This is absolutely one of my favorite books of all time and, in my humble opinion, a much better book."
2,strange...,"At first, this book seemed intreasting, but as it progressed it turned dull. It also had some weird themes that were very 60's that I couldn't relate to. It became to preachy, which RH doesn't carry out very well. I wouldn't recommend reading it."
2,bubble burst,"As a youngster in the late 60s, early 70s Heinlein was my muse....until I saw him speak at the 92nd st.Y in NYC in 1972 or so. He was asked why he wrote ""Stranger"". His reply? For the money, of course. He was tapping into the spirit of the times..free love, communes, etc. To his detriment, in my opinion. Ah well...life goes on."
2,"Sorry, I don't like books about Hippies.","I read so much about this book and how it's supposed to be the greatest sci-fi ever written but I take these things with a grain of salt. Sure there are some great concepts but what I would've loved to have known is how much influence this book had on Hippie culture in the 60's. That there would've saved me some time and frustration reading what ended up being one of my least favourite books. Sure my review is quite biased and the book does present some wonderful ideologies but maybe it just hasn't aged well. I still respect the hell out of the book because of how brave it was an how little it held back but I really didn't enjoy it. Sorry, I'm glad most people did and I won't deny its importance however be warned that you may still not like it."
3,Bigger than Average,The book (Story) is a fine one . . . but was disappointed that it's size is bigger than the average paperback - I like my paperbacks to be the standard size - fitting on the shorter shelves all together nice and neat - this one is BIG - 6.25 x 9.25 - not so nice.
5,stranger in a strange land,"The book I ordered, stranger in a strange land by robert a. heinlein arrived well before the anticipated arrival date and was exactly as described, in very good condition."
3,"Good, but not outstanding","It's not a bad book, and almost required reading due to it's massive influence and wide audience. Still, there are certainly better Heinlein books out there. It does ooze Heinein's views on life, love, relationships, etc...hints of which can be found in many of his writing, but this one really focuses on it as the primary surface theme."
5,Absolutely Thought-Provoking,"This is one of those stories that will leave you awake at night asking yourself ""Is everything that I ever knew wrong?"". Its that challenging. Heinlein rightly deserves the mantle of ""Grand Old Man of Science Fiction"". Though this book does not necessarilly display his forte but his investigations of the human culture is most thought-provoking. Though it may seem from the other reviews that this book preaches a brand new philosophy, Ill tell you that it doesn't. Heinlein asks questions so obvious it makes you wonder why you never asked them yourself! The story challenges the basic fiber of ""culture"" and ""morality"" in a fashion that can only be deemed as ""innocent"". And these questions are the most provocative of all. A must read, not just for philosopher ... and soul-searchers, but for anyone who considers himself of open mind."
5,Confidential to Valentine Smith fans,"If you already know and love this book, you must read the 1991 release of the uneditted version from the originally submitted manuscript. Valentine Smith's grokking of Earth, only hinted at in the old favorite because of the mores of its time, comes to life in the unexpurgated version now available."
1,Perfect for polyamorous misanthropes!,"If you think that sex is the greatest achievement of the human race and that the human race is doomed to failure, than this book is for you. Plus, there is so much more:1. It's not really science fiction.2. It is chock-full of pointless conversation.3. It's okay to kill ""dumb"" or ""bad"" people.4. Organized religion is evil.5. Women exist just to serve men.Plus many, many more great ideas.And, if you act now, we'll send you the uncut version, wasting even more of your time!Order today!!!"
5,Yes!,"Who cares whether it's a ""sweeping philosophical work of genius""?! It's a frigging great story! Ignore the naysayers (glad there aren't that many of them) and read this book. You'll be glad you did."
5,Best book ever!,"This is in my opinion the best book EVER written. I read it when I was 13, abit young for such books but I loved it. I though it was so touching. It made me cry. I highly recommend it to everyones who is exploring their spirituality."
2,I expected more...,"I could say that this book has dissapointed me. I expected more.I tried to finish it, but I didn't make it. Soon it became rather boring although the story seemed to be promising in the beginning. Pity."
4,"Charming and amusing, but a little dated","Martian refugee Valentine Michael Smith changes from hilarious weakling, to sex god to, well...to god over 400 pages! In the interim we see a little too much of the amusing but unlikely Jubal Harshaw, who runs a palatial residence staffed by virtual slaves on the back of romance writing! (He shelters the refugee from chasing police.) We also get to here too much 60s claptrap about religion and morality, and too many ""speeches to camera"" by the characters.I absolutely loved the opening section of the book (before the omnipresent Jubal takes over) when the Martian is adjusting to Earthly language and emotions, as he gets accustomed to the thick air and high gravity. The rest is readable and sometimes fun. But I'm disappointed since I wanted to be able to recommend this as a crossover novel for non SF reading friends. But it just isn't good enough or tight enough. Maybe it's these 50,000 words that have just been reinstated!"
4,Two Books In One -- Too Bad the First One is Better,"The first half of thisbook is marvelous, with extremely entertaining characters and a suspenseful plot. Sadly, Heinlein is so intent on expressing Michael Valentine Smith's worldview that the second half of the book describes Mike's attempt to found a church based on hippy ideas about free love and the like. The premise is fascinating, but the end is so preposterous that it really degrades the entire work. I don't challenge the worldview (although I don't agree with it), but I am dismayed by the simplistic way in which Heinlein executes it. A good book, but not nearly what it could have been. Of course, I have not read the shortened version -- I have a feeling the editors were correct in the beginning"
3,Decent,"When I heard this was a sci-fi standard, I felt rather obligated to read it. But going through it, I just was not captivated. Oh, it was alright, to be sure, but I did not get the hoopla. Was it a trend setter pushing the boundary? Introducing socially controversial issues like sexuality? Part of the problem as well is that the original critically heralded book was way trimmed down from what I read. Researching this point I found there is a disagreement as to which is superior, that perhaps the cut version was actually superior.I'll check out another of Heinlein's books, I got a long list to go through first of other authors, I try to limit myself to only one author to get through as many different and diverse as I can, and having two sons certainly does not lend itself well to the situation."
4,This Classic Is Great As An Audio Book!,"Our family listened to the entire novel during our two-week time in Alaska, while we explored the Kenai peninsula in our rented SUV. Our two teenage kids were engaged with the story, which was a nice bonus. The story moves pretty slowly, and a lot of it seems dated now, but I still like the feeling of getting wrapped up in Heinlein's vision."
4,Fascinating,"Interesting read. The characters weren't entirely believable at times (especially the women, the author definitely wrote men better) but great food for thought and very readable."
2,Didn't catch my interest,"The title was interesting to me, but the book did not capture my interest. I never did finish reading the book."
2,It's the abridged version,"One of my favorite books ever. When I gave away my special copy, I bought this as a replacement, only to discover that it was the abridged version. So disappointing, as that was never indicated in the item description at the time (this may have changed since then). If you want the full version, look closely before you buy. It's worth reading the full version. I don't know how you could abridge such a wonderful book."
2,Guess I've outgrown it,"I loved this book when I first read it as a teenager, and again as a young adult. I have read it now for the 3rd time and I had to push myself to finish. It is true what other reviewers have said about the sexism, I don't know why this did not bother me so much in my youth, but now it is just embarrassing.I thought the philosophy was so deep before, now it just seems silly.Spoiler alert: Mike finally learns how to laugh when he discovers that the essence of humor is pain this is an important step in his personal development and I think it's wrong. I can think of many instances where I have been doubled over and in tears with laughing at jokes or stories that include no pain or humiliation. Another theme in Stranger is ""how does one define 'man'?"" Here it's like Heinlein is trying to be profound, but really he just dodges the question. Maybe I should not have read it a 3rd time. My list of favorite books is one shorter now."
2,sexist and silly,"I can't believe I plowed through this whole thing. Many times I wanted to put it down, but I forced myself to finish it.Heinlein had a good idea, but he ruined it with the second half of the book. All a Man from Mars can do is start a cultish commune? How much more interesting this book could have been had the author explored a different vein instead of going into the ranch and all the stupid stuff with the commune.The thing that really bothered me about this book is how idiotic the women are. They are all a bunch of ditzes and their main purpose seems to be to serve the men. Of course, the book is a product of its time, but I wanted to smack Jill (I think that was the main female's name .. its been awhile since I read this book.) She and the other women were completely dependent on the men. I'm sure that's a man's fantasy for the future, but I wish Heinlein would have given women some credit."
2,read the first half,"The first half of the book has supsense and suprise. It explores themes and gives an occasional new angle to things, even years after it was writen. Which is a major achievement.But you better stop at page 208, when they have made the president of the world the one to manage Valentines hugh inheritence. After that point nothing much happens, and that it takes Heinlein about 200 pages to write that as well...And then of course, there are those things Heinlein is unincorrigible disenchanting in: having again (!) an old man with a series of beautiful young women adoring him; being able to be a homophobe in a book advocating sexual liberation; perceiving the women at best in indigestable paternalistic way.On the whole this second part of the book gives the impression of being a disappointed old mans day dream. You could easily substitute ""day"" with ""wet"". But I don't want to be offensive, so I don't."
4,This vendor stands behind the product,I received the book and it was worn more than I thought it should be. I sent an email to the vendor and they promptly refunded my money. I will do business with this vendor again. Very trustworthy.
1,Sexist! Some clever Sci-Fi ideas. Entirely a philosophy book.,"I hated this. I've loved other heinlein's, and rarely hate anything. The portrayal of women really bothered me (*lots* of references/jokes about cooking dinner & sex).Portrayal of a free-sex society was interesting.Several negative mentions about gay-ness, and while I should write this off to the atmosphere the book was written in, it still really bothered me.Dragged a lot. Obvious ending. Frustratingly over-powered alients, in terms of plot.Sorry if my review offends anyone for whom this is their fav book :)"
1,Boring... I mean BORING boring,"After reading this book and ""I Will Fear no Evil"" (which I couldn't even finish), I don't think I will ever read one of Heinlein's books again. It was a complete waste of my time, but of course, that is my opinion..."
1,Irrelevant,I did not enjoy this book. If I were shallow and had no exposure to the world then perhaps this book would move me as it apparently moved others. I found it tedious and bizarre with little bearing on reality. The redeeming feature that apparently moves people is that it exposes the same bad characteristics of humanity that have been recorded for thousands of years beginning with the old testament. I would pass on this book.
2,Damaged disc,"The audio book arrived speedily and packaged well. However, the 2nd disc is damaged to he point where it skips constantly and I am unable to listen to it. I have gotten no response from the company."
3,My Favorite Books,"This is my favorite book of all time. However, I purchased the unabridged version which I found to be too wordy."
2,A product of its times?,"Someone told me a little about the premise of the book: a man who was raised by Martians comes to earth and navigates our culture here. That sounded like it could be really interesting. I found out it won a Hugo Award, too, so that sealed the deal and I bought it.Turns out, this is just sloppy writing. What a waste of a great idea. The Martians and their society were the best part, but there was precious little of them seen in the book. It was all about monologues about religion and angels talking about Earthly assignments. Oh, and lots of sex with attractive, submissive women. This book made me dislike Heinlein both professionally and personally due to the gratuitous pontifications. I can't believe this is a sci-fi classic.If you are still interested in this book, borrow it from the library before you decide to buy it. I will never be tricked by another book that won a Hugo Award again."
2,Started off good,"The first couple of sections are very good. Of course, you have to suspend disbelief, but this is easy as long as you just redefine mars as a planet in another galaxy or something. Science proved wrong alot of what was written in this book. Stereotubes? The were TV's then. Like a good reader though, I can suspend disbelief and believe that people call the TV a stereo tube.Some where in the second or third section the book turns to complete crap. It becomes Heinlein's reactions to religion and philosophy. Most religions are blasphemed and free love orgies run rampant. The way Mike makes things just disappear has me worrying about the environment and I really don't see what humans are doing know as that damaging. Did I mention this book is sexist. Women are nurses, strippers, secretaries, rites of passage in new religions. The purpose of women in this story is to serve men, even sexually. (...) But every man realizes that this is just a male fantasy.Read something else."
3,"Man writes about ""Growing Closer""","Somehow when male writers try to think outside the box, it so often tends towards something Darren Roy Mack might dream up. A second data point is the Rocheworld series, which makes a real attempt at being Hard-SF yet the sexual subplot-line seems almost tongue-in-cheek it's so over-the-top.What with the amazing performance of the Mars landers, from a robotic viewpoint colonizing the universe seems almost a solved problem. To add the human part of the equation, though, I recommend a step back - read ""The Selfish Gene"", eschew Group-Selectionist-Idiocy, and REALLY think outside the box...I see that the Wikipedia write-up on Mack steers clear of detailing Mack's taste for couples-style-swinging as the root cause of his ultimately disastrous relationship with Charla, but as I recall this was the point where his train left the tracks, so to speak."
4,If all my friends were as clever and likeable as these characters I wouldn't need to read so much. LOL,"This book/CD starts out slow but once it gets going it's all ya can do to stop. The supporting char.'s made this story memorable and fun. The main char. Is somewhat hard to get over. At the start he is terrible but that is the point don't worry by the end you'll love him too. But besides the loveable char.s the thing that really makes this book great is the way it approaches life, religion, and philosophy. It tackles all these subjects and never attacks one in a negative way. It is always respectful of everyone and their beliefs while still making you think about those subjects' core properties. It really examines what it means to be a human. It's a great book hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
3,"Good, but not to be taken too seriously","Many of the other reviews have already pointed out some of this book's shortcomings: a protagonist that is bland if not outright boring; a seriously longwinded discussion of morality and social mores that is driven by a series of straw man arguments; a limp and unsatisfying ending. Although this book is good, we've come to expect better from Heinlein.But still, Heilein was on to something, particularly the examination of humanity from the outsider's perspective. That idea sustains this book, when otherwise the plot would merely wallow in the author's idiosyncratic views of sex, religion, and government."
2,Don't waste your time,"Not a horrible book, just a bad one, this novel is perhaps one of the most overrated in all SF. I am a fan of Heinlein's, but this book represents a personal nadir in his writings. A problem is, perhaps, that straight SF has never been RH's forte, and that he really does not have the depth of insights into how and why people behave as they do as do, say, Melville or even Austen, or for that matter Orson Card (to give an SF example).Do not waste your time or money on this preachy, overly-long, non-insightful novel. (""Hey, the devils have seen to it that we're not going to reproduce, so how's about we nuke ourselves?!"" Baaaaaaaarrrrf.) Heinlein has written enough decent material that he has earned the right to have this embarrassment quietly forgotten, revered only by neo-hippie New Ageists"
3,A bit of a disappointment,"Before I review this I must state that this is the first book I have ever read that fits into the science fiction genre.This book really is a vehicle for Heinlein to critique organized religion, sexual attitudes and hangups and general all around human nature that uses science fiction as a backdrop. Not that I disagree much with what he was getting at but this was a lot to read just to make those points. The story itself was somewhat entertaining but I felt like it was building up to something great and it never really happened. Not that it was bad but it was still a bit of a disappointment.I do see how Stranger in a Strange Land was such a controversial book given the time that it was released but like most stuff that caused big controversy 40, 50, years ago when you read it now it wouldnt raise an eyebrow by todays standards."
2,A blueprint for left-wing religious cults,"The underlying message of this novel is that life is too awful to deal with logically. To be happy, a person has to invent a more pleasing reality and evade any contradictions or aspects of it that can't be reconciled. Lacking the imagination and intellectual discipline to devise such an alternate reality, many early readers sought a place within left-wing religious cults, most infamously the Charles Manson family. Stranger in a Strange Land was the Manson family's blueprint and bible. So influential was Heinlein's work to the cult's development that one of its members adopted the peculiar nickname of one of the novel's main characters."
2,Not Too Bad For Children/A Sci-Fi Primer,"A very silly, very simple book with no challenging ideas. Not for serious contemplation, but not without redeeming features."
3,return of the martian,this book has an interesting storyline to it but i felt myself drifting throughout it. the writing sense did not capture me as a book should.
2,1960's story is a little out-of-place 40 years later,"The biggest problem is that the book is based on the premise of an advanced civilization existing on Mars. It was written in 1962, just a few years before the Mariner missions beamed backed the first detailed pictures of the Martian surface, which proved that Mars was a dead planet - oops! Overnight, the opinion of the possibility of life on Mars went bankrupt:http://mars.astrobio.net/news/article332.htmlLooking past that little idiosynchrocy, the book starts off interestingly-enough, but begins to bog down in the later parts; which, may I dare say, involve a lot of sex and religion (maybe these issues were shockers in 1962, but they are somewhat of a bore 40 years later). So, what we end up with is a lot of pointless religion and sex, finishing with Valentine committing a pointless suicide."
4,"Do you grok it, my aquafraternal comrade?","Though far from perfect, Stranger in a Strange Land is a great read. The novel starts off somewhat strongly. It grabbed me from the beginning. Despite sagging a bit towards the end, the story wraps up with quite a punch.Some parts of the novel seem extremely dated and may be difficult to get through, but in the end this book is worth reading--if only for the ideas presented in it. Recommended (though not for all)."
4,"""Stranger"" encourages reading between the lines","Some of the things in this book are a little outdated...if not somewhat questionable in a realistic sense (as is communism which looks good on paper but has no practical application) but this does not detract from the brilliance of Heinlein. ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" is a wonderfully told story about love and the beauty/tragedy of humanity. Heinlein's use of archetypes makes this book easy to relate to and, ultimately, a timeless treasure. I had read this book in highschool and it is still one of my favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the sci-fi genre but craves a more ""philosophical"" plot."
5,Ethics vs. Heinlein- An Epic Struggle,"Stranger in a Strange land is a counterpoint, a view of our ethics and conventions through the mind of one not raised by our standards. It shows the limits of sexual and physical jealousy and presents a view to how humanity should approach the future. A srong novel, from opening lline to finish, and thoroughly readable. It is no wonder that this is a classic of science fiction."
3,It's starting to feel dated...,"...and the sociology is starting to grate.It may be that I've read too much Heinlein and the constant sexual exploration scenes start to feel gratuitous rather than earned. It may be that this was so much a book of the sixties that it now seems inappropriate. I don't know.Heinlein remains a talented writer, and the book is engaging. Up until the cult business begins, the premise is well explored. For me, it is as though halfway through the book he realized that he had a point to make and started rushing you through to get to that point. The ending of the relationship between Ben and Jill is glossed over, all the real emotions of the characters about each other are neatly trampled by the idea of 'grokking' it, and I started to heartily wish for Mike to show some real flaws.When I was younger, I'd read this book and been much more impressed. It hasn't aged well."
3,Nothing like I thought it would be,"I liked the first half and hated the second half. Jubal Harshaw was brilliant but after a while he just became a tool to preach Heinlein's philosophies. Even though I agreed with most of what the author said, I don't like to be preached at and especially when it's disguised as a story."
5,The best book i've ever read,"This book should be read by all the students, and by all people who would like to think different."
5,This book is almost TOO good,"This book is so good, I didn't want it to end. It really made me look at things in a different way. Honestly a moving piece of work"
5,Should be read by everyone,"I read Stranger in a Strange Land when I was in was in Middle School, and was recently re-assigned the novel for AP English. The few years difference in maturity has made all the difference. This is the essential science fiction work; both entertaining and a comment on culture, religion, sexuality, and humanity in general. If you're a closed minded conservative, be prepared to be shocked. Heinlein will touch on subjects that you will view as taboo. If you're a little more open-minded, you may actually find that Heinlein can be hysterically funny, in a cynical sort of way. Either way or another, the message can't be ignored. Can you grok it?"
3,Strange and thought provoking,"Make it 3 1/2 stars. This is a strange book. Though this is classified as science fiction, that classification is only half true. The other half is a commentary on human psychology and philosophy. The book started out strong, but somewhere in the middle the author seems to have lost the plot. He gets stuck with the concept of religion, cult and God. For a commentary on humanity and society, addressing those topics might be necessary, but I felt he over-did it there. One other drawback which I felt is that he could have developed the characters better. But inspite of these drawbacks, it is a very interesting book. Some of the conversations between Valentine Michael Smith and Jubal are thought provoking and intriguing. Though, I believe this book could have been better and that it started out strong and faltered in the middle, I still consider this as one of the better science fiction/philosophy books I have read. It portrays a bold view-point about religion."
2,I don't grok it.,"Stranger in a Strange Land seems to be Heinlein's personal soapbox for airing his unresolved conflicts about religion, sex and the world in general. Maybe it was revolutionary 40 years ago, but it doesn't hold up very well. It's the Playboy Philosophy meets the Jetsons, filled with WWII and '50s slang and references. Heinlein doesn't talk to his readers, he talks AT them. I'm guessing Heinlein's ideal woman was a really hot overgrown highschool girl rapturously listening to him pontificate. And why do I have the strong impression Heinlein had to be the smartest guy in every room he entered? A strange land, indeed."
2,Unrealized Potential,"""Stranger in a Strange Land"" started off full of promise, but after about a hundred pages or so it descended into sophmoric ""philosophy"" about the nature of love and intimacy. I hate to sound snobbish but this novel is not literature, it's simply popular genre fiction masquerading as a book that deals with the human condition. The premise was actually pretty great, but apparently there was no editor, (for this book really only needs to be half as long), and the ""message"" overtakes the storytelling. This will probably be the last ""science fiction"" novel I will ever read, and I'll go back to reading what really constitutes literature: Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Baldwin, Kafka, O'Connor, etc."
2,Heavy-Handed and pedestrian,"This book starts off reasonably interesting, and I had hoped to read a book rife with futuristic politics and personal hubris. But it soon degenerates into a rather mundane diatribe for or against religion--it's hard to tell--and, while I usually enjoy such books that discuss these issues, Heinlein doesn't pull it off effectively. Heinlein seems to spend the first third of the book being interesting, then switching to soapbox mode. Such methods do not a good book make.Still, the characters are reasonably intriguing; the three girls and other workers who live with Judal are more fleshed out, in my mind, than Valentine Michael Smith or Jill.This would be an excellent read--if it were about 200 pages shorter."
1,Please read an earlier Heinlein,"This really is not a very good Heinlein book, probably his second or third worst depending on how you like ""I will fear no evil"" and ""The number of the beast"". Of his later books only Friday and The Cat are good unless you are a die hard Heinlein fan (which I have been for 30+ years). I just reread Stranger hoping I was too young when I first read it, but it seems even worse now.Stick with the early Heinlein adventures and save these weird ones for later."
1,"Dated, boring, bad...","...and the novel equivalent of ""Barbarella""...This book is like all those obscure psychedelic albums from the same time period. I'm sure at the time, and with the right complimentary, uh, influences, one would consider them masterpieces. Today, though, they're just embarassments to the excesses of a phase that has somehow inflated itself into the Annals of Great Cultural Movements.This is Heinlein as his solipsistic worst. Read ""Dune"" instead."
3,Grok This,"Ack! Even though Heinlein was a 'bit' of a sexist (to say the least), I've always liked his books ... until this one. I love the idea of a human being stranded on another planet and coming back to earth years later, but I couldn't get past the dawning of the age of Aquarius. It was soooooo 60s. Free love and all that groking. I could just see the technicolor paisley flowing freely.The book left me cold. Maybe I was jealous that I didn't live the 60s. Maybe I just didn't understand it."
1,Stranger in a Strange Land,"Engagingly written, but incredibly chauvanistic and terrifyingly homophobic. Skip it."
2,Didn't hold my interest,"I only read this book because it is ""one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time"". I don't think so. I liked the characters in the story, but it just went on and on... I could not keep reading after the 500th page or so, it did not hold my interest."
2,first half o.k. down hill after that,"This is the first Heinlein book I read. I really enjoyed reading it at first. The philosophy started off making lots of sense and the story was entertaining. However, halfway thru the book the story line gets rediculously stupid and the philosophy deteriorates to something out of a Barney episode. Still an o.k. read."
3,Not all true classics are truly great.,"This book contains virtually every Heinlein flaw...but also every touch that makes him a true Grand Master. This one is a classic and required reading for every SF fan, but it's not even close to Heinlein's best."
2,NOT one of the greatest science fiction novels,"This is one of Heinlein's more embarassing efforts. He was clearly pandering to the free-love atmosphere of the 60s. I loved and read all of his books as a teenager. I have re-read many of them and have come to see that his thinking was often one-dimensional and predictable; patriarchal and pro-war. However, he had a very creative mind and no matter how bad his books are, they are still readable, and they are definitely better than Star Trek."
5,Best. Book. Ever.,"Despite it's inherent sexism, homophobia, and somewhat rambling philosophical passages, Stranger is still one of the best books I have ever read. It makes you think, it challenges your worldview, and, most importantly, it entertains. Who of us does not wish they could grok a wrongness and send it into another dimension? Who doesn't want to learn Martian?"
4,Entertaining and Idealistic,"This idealistic sci-fi novel by Robert Heinlein is well worth reading. It's the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a nave and innocent young man born to astronaut parents and raised by Martians. Returning to Earth at the age of 20, Smith explores human morality and the meaning of love. He is under the guided protection of Jubal Harshaw, a loveable old grouch who takes on a major role. Smith founds a church that advocates free love while teaching the psychic talents of the Martians. Smith and for that matter Heinlein promote free love and brotherhood, while taking a critical view of organized religion and authoritarianism.This book was considered controversial when it was published in 1961, and it influenced many persons attracted to the counter-culture lifestyle of the 1960's - sadly it may have also inspired Charles Manson. The book is occasionally unsympathetic towards women, but it remains a moving read."
3,Utopian Novel,"This is indeed a dated work, but may be worth a read. It is another ""share and share alike"" work reminiscent of Thea Alexander's ""2150 AD."" New ideas are introduced to the characters and they, in typical human fashion, turn them into dogma. If you've explored Alexander's work, or read and gleaned something from the ""Conversations With God"" series by Walsch, then ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" may be for you. While reading though, remember Tennyson's words, ""There is more faith in honest doubt than in a thousand dogmas."""
5,Excelent Read...,"This book is absolutely amazing. Draws you in from the very first page, and after reading it, it leaves you with no questions, but a very insightful look into human nature.Once you pick it up you will find it hard to put it down to do things like sleep or go to work."
3,Seems a little dated,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this book starts out great and seems to ""bog down"" about midway through. I think the reason is that at the time it was written, the ideas expressed in the book were much more controversial and, well, new. Today I think we reach a point in the book where it just feels the author is making a big deal about nothing. ooooh free love, clothes disappearing, refusal to play by the ""rules of society"", these ideas have been beaten to death by this point. I'm not sure if I'd call this sci-fi so much as social commentary."
2,Starts off great but...,"I absolutely was hooked for the first 2/3rds of the book...But by the time I was 2/3rds of the way through I was getting very tired with the author on his soapbox beating up organized religion. Heinlein's preachiness (sp?) is the same reason why I didn't like Starship Troopers. The author doesn't know when to stop and realize his point is taken.Granted I read the unabridged version so some of the content others wouldn't have been burdened by I did get burdened by.I was disappointed because I felt the beginning had lots of suspense and intrigue but then the book eventually took a turn towards seeing see how a person can ""restructure"" (degenerate is a better word) their moral behavior in an immoral world.Therefore, I didn't love the main characters by the end because there wasn't anything left to like about them.My two cents worth."
2,Inconsistent,"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 or so of this book. It was entertaining, thoughtful, good-old science fiction. But then the book suffers a huge shift in tone. You just shouldn't introduce angels and a bunch of pseudo-religious nonsense that far into a book. To me, it was about as jarring as switching from third to first person in the middle of a novel. I can't help but wonder if Heinlein wrote the beginning and the end of this book at different times."
4,Cerebral Science Fiction,"Tackles big questions from philosophy to sociology and uses the narrative as a vehicle to do so. Using a ""man from mars"" and how he would absorb our culture and cultural taboos works well. If you're into lush description and scene setting, this is not the book for you. Very little of that... minimalist... just enough to orient you so that the characters can get onto their conversations about the big questions. Some parts are pretty thought-provoking. Overall, I'm enjoying it."
3,Not my cup of tea.,"I'm sure the book is good it just didn't appeal to me. The book had a great concept but in my opinion it went downhill a little. Still an interesting read. Also, you can kinda tell when read reading it that it is kind of dated."
3,Not Heinlein's best,"While STRANGER gets the nod by many people to be Heinlein's best book, I didn't find it so. For all the press he gets for being a feminist, his female characters in this novel are little more than science fiction's answer to Charlie's Angels. The main character is meant to serve as a modern metaphor for Christ, but his message is somewhat dubious. All in all, STRANGER reads well and some of the ideas presented are interesting. But I can only give this book an average rating. Worthy of your time but not of all the accolades."
2,Disappointing.,"This book fails to dig deeply enough into any aspect. If Heinlein is trying to showcase the philosophy (and the taste offered is interesting) he needs to focus on it instead of just giving us glimpses. If Heinlein's trying to entertain us, he needs to have more of interest happen. If he's trying to explore the characters we need to see *inside* them more.My impression from reading this book is that someone had taken a great novel, cut a thin slice from it, and published it separately."
2,How is this book the greatest selling Sci-Fi novel?,"Of the Sci-Fi books I have read (and this is including the 60+ pathetic Star Trek novels I have read) this is one of the worst. One half of the book is an interesting Sci-Fi action adventure. The second half is basically a dime-store Harlequin romance novel. I think that what happened in the second half of the novel is that Heinlein decided that it would be better to appeal to the newly rising sex-crazed pop-culture of the 1960's, than come up with a creative ending. Yeah, it is great to think that sex is one of the greatest things in the galaxy, but if it is, my god we have some problems to face up to. I really hated the fact that Heinlein made the main character be a combination of Jesus Christ, a golden retriever, and Don Juan Quixote."
3,mundane ideas from a mundane author,"Heinnlein presents ideas that he seems to t hink are revolutionary, exciting -- new! When in fact they're boring and unoriginal, with a pathetic story used to present them to the reader. Many authors have done far better jobs of presentign ideas that are trully intriguing, and exciting. I find that all Henleisn novels are much like this. Read somehtingn better liek Dune, Foundation or Childhood's end. These deserve to be called scienficiton classics."
5,Strangers In The Strangest Of Lands,"""Thou Art God"" - Valentine Micheal SmithAs we begin Valentine Micheal Smith is ""being held prisoner"" in a hospital. His Nurse, and ""Water Brother"" Gillian Boardman, constructs a plan to break him out of this prison to meet one Lawyer Jubal E. Harshaw. From then on Harshaw begins to teach him about earth, mortality, and other usful things.It was a very amusing book, and by far Heinleins best. What I found interesting, is all the lands to land on, Valentine Micheal Smith landed on the Strangest of them all."
2,"Adolescent fantasy, adult themes","Stranger in a Strange Land was and is Heinlein's most controversial work. It was written at the beginning of the end of his career, when his protagonists were created using cookie cutters. Still, for its assessment of religion(s), Stranger had no equal in any literature, before or since.Read as a story, Stranger is a tale that gets started on the right track but ends up following a tangent into adolescent fantasies about sex, riches, and hedonism. Read as an analysis of religion, the story remains a classic social commentary by one of the more capable commentators.If you want moving science fiction, read Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. If you want one of the novels that moved science fiction, read Stranger in a Strange Land."
4,Fine Alternative to U.S. Textbooks,"This book covers equivalent ground to U.S. M.B.A. texts, though the examples (which are good) focus on European situations. The balance between theory and practice is excellent, with some fine information about markets as they work in the real world. The book is clearly set out and represents fine value for money. My only reservation (and reason for witholding the fifth star) is that the book dates from 1993 and could do with some updating in a new edition, such as the effect of the Euro on the European markets."
2,Hard to follow,"I have to agree with the other reviewer in that this book was hard to follow. The storyline jumped around a bit. The scenes never connected, which in turn made me feel disconnected from the book. I couldn't get into the story and finally I just had to hurry through it to get finish with it. It's not a bad book, but there have defintely been better ones by this author."
3,Needs a little work,"The storyline is a bit sporadic and it is difficult to follow one scene to the next. I think this book could have used a little polishing before it was completed, however it is not necessarily a bad read if you are just looking to kill a little bit of time. Overall it was an average read-not the best, but also, not the worst novel out there on the shelves."
2,KOHLER K-3183-NA Undertone Extra-Large Undercounter Kitchen Sink,The sink was exactly as was stated in the description. After reading the specifications of the sink I ordered it and it fit perfectly into my countertop. The quality of the sink is outstanding. When I ordered it the sales agent was extremely helpful and if I have to order from Amazon again I would not hesitate.The product I ordered was: KOHLER K-3183-NA Undertone Extra-Large Undercounter Kitchen Sink
5,fossil watch,"I was tickled to find a round-face watch with real numbers on it; the design is beautiful! The light blue face adds sparkle to the appearance and does not interfere with viewing the time. It has a date box but is too small for me to read and i haven't figured out how to change it to correct date; tho not a real issue for me. The band fits like a bracelet, rather loose, on my arm. Only real complaint is the 'information' sheet is not particular to this model, and does not provide the information i need. but overall i am very happy with my purchase!!"
3,How about a live CD from the Early years?,"Why don't these guys put out a live CD from 1973-1974, before they went soft? There are tons of live stuff from 1980-81, with the same song list. They are probably using the same tapes from the 'Snaz live album."
4,Perfect old-school youth mask,Got this for my son who can't stand using the hockey style catcher's masks. He really likes it. It is light and works fine. The harness is very cheap and plastic though so we replaced with one from Rawlings. You can get direct from their site.
2,Not impressed,"I got this book because it had many positive reviews. I don't get it though after reading it. It feels more like a novelty book than a ""real"" book. There are some clever parts to it, but I don't think I'd buy it if I knew it was more of a novelty item than a real book in which a story of some kind is told, autobiographical, fiction, whatever."
2,Only A Teeny Tiny Bit Clever,"I wouldn't really consider this a book...it's a collection of random thoughts and observations, the better ones realistic and relate-able, the majority just filler to complete a BOOK. Ultimately, it's incredibly self-indulgent. If you have no attention span whatsoever, and like to read ""books"" that you'll forget the second you're done with them, then this book is for you."
3,bookclub response,"We read this book for our bookclub. I thought the format for writing in this bookvery interesting, however many of the girls thought this book boring. As usual Itried to keep an open mind while reading this. While, I think it was not terriblyexciting it still was a respectful attempt at writing in her own unusual way."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"This book was recommended by the author of The Happiness Project, which I loved. However, this book is extremely boring. The A-Z random format, while novel, makes it difficult to follow. I always finish reading every book I buy, but I broke that rule this time. I normally pass my books on to others when I'm done, but I'm actually thinking of putting this one on the recycle bin--never done that before, but I can't bear to burden anyone else with it. I feel like I wasted several hours of my life."
2,Not Impressed,"While there were few fleeting moments of humor, overall it felt like the author was just rambling her way through the ""alphabet."""
2,a real disappointment,"Disappointment of the year. I was quite excited about Krouse Rosenthal's book, but perhaps ordinariness is indeed simply too dull to write about (Tolstoy nailed that one at the beginning of Anna Karenia). Her style is choppy and disconnected, which, she mentions, has never endeared her to editors. It never endeared her to this reader, either. Short as the book was, I was unable to finish it--a rare problem for me."
3,Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Book,"I spotted this at the library and at first glance, thought it would be great, especially. It had two or three ""FUNNY"" entries, but the rest of the book lived up to it's promise: ordinary. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it-- I did. Many of the quirky/random thoughts were cute. The concept was cute. The accompanying photos and drawings were cute. Over all, it was an hour well spent.Given some of the really GOOD books out there that deserve a 5 star rating, an average/ordinary 3-star is perfectly fine for this one.I'd hate to think this book was nothing more than a big ego-fest for AKR, (""I'm SO GREAT that even my unremarkable, ordinary THOUGHTS are SPECIAL enough for a whole book!"")If the author's intent was to encourage readers to look inward and joyfully catalog our own quirks, then I'm sure many of us are already doing so after a reading."
3,SEEMED LIKE AN OUTLINE,"IT WAS SIMPLISTIC.THERE WAS SOME INTERESTING ""STUFF"" BUT AS A WHOLE IT SEEMED INCOMPLETE, MORE LIKE AN OUTLINE FOR A FORTHCOMING STORY, THAN THE STORY ITSELF"
1,How did this get published?,"I did not, I confess, finish this book, although I did try. I just kept wondering how Amy Krouse Rosenthal (and , more importantly, her publisher) could have thought that anyone would be interested in reading this book beyond the first few pages.It's a great conceit, but isn't the author still supposed to have something interesting to say? I thought perhaps it was me - I'm a bit too old to be impressed by bloggers and their blow-by-blow descriptions of their lives - so I gave the book to a friend who is the same age as the author. Said friend has good taste and hated the book, too."
2,Just Ordinary,"A bunch of tidbits about the author's life in alphabelial order.It was exactly what the book claimed to be.I guess I expected the book would give me a new purpose in life or something, but it didn't.And there were some funny parts, and parts where you think to yourself, 'wow, I do that too!'.But overall, it just didn't cut it."
1,CANNOT BELIEVE THIS WAS PUBLISHED,"This has to be the most narcissistic book I have ever read. Another reviewer described it as self-indulgent, and I agree. I started reading this with the best of intentions, but then found myself skipping parts in the hope I would find something relevant and/or meaningful. I found this book to be nothing but private musings and opinions about the most trivial and mundane things, and I could not helping thinking ""who cares?"". At the risk of offending those who liked or even loved it, this was nothing but nonsense and a waste of time."
1,What the...?,"This book does not make any sense nor does it serve any purpose. It's not not even remotely entertaining! I recommend ""The Meaning of Life"" by Bradley Trevor Greive instead. It's inspirational, funny, and so very clever (unlike this book)."
3,An incomplete document,"If you are really interested in this subject, then you should get Mission to Asia edited by Christopher Dawson. Mission to Asia contains the Plano Carpini work, but also contains the account of William of Rubruck as well as the narrative of Brother Benedict the Pole, and other documents. For an excellent discussion of this work see the review of Mission to Asia by Mithridates VI of Pontus."
4,First Hand Account,Great read written at the time giving insight into the thoughts beliefs and life of not only the Mongols but also medieval Europeans.
1,Surgical Weight Knee High Open Toe Stockings,"These XL-surgical knee high, open toe support stockings do not fit. (Please note that I am not an XL person, and do not have XL calves.) The wording on the package states that if the plastic wrap is opened, the item is un-returnable. How could I possible know the ""fit"" of the stockings without opening the plastic wrap? So, I'm out almost $50.00 since I cannot wear the stockings, nor can I return them. That sucks!!!"
5,My favorite brand.,I have tried other brands of compression stockings and find Jobst to be the best. Please note: these stockings are now available in petite sizes!!!
3,Ran out of sequins and seed beads,"Beautiful stocking and great, complete instructions. Ran out of white sequins and seed beads, though. I found it very enjoyable to make!"
2,not enough suppies!!,I just started making this stocking and am already out of blue sequines.nothing worse then trying to make something you dont have enough of
3,Synthasizing Asprin,I for one give this book a 3 because is it was good but 2 off and a little boring. If you like a calm read this is for u.
4,Synthisesizing Asprin,I thought this book was realy crackerjack and almost a 5. I know the name sounds completely boring but try it and you shall see what I mean. I never thought I could like a book that boring but I was wrong it is a realy cool book.
4,Little Kidnappers great movie,This movie is definitely a keeper in your collection. A great family movie. The two young boys who play the brothers are just too cute for words. One of my favorite movies.
4,My daughter loves elmo,When I purchased it I thought I was getting the electronic book as well. My own stupidity. Don't make the same mistake.
5,THESE ARE THE BEST PLUS SOCKS,"I AM A NURSE & HAVE WORN GOLD TOE ANKLETS FOR MANY YEARS. FIRST, THEY COME IN PLUS SIZE-----VERY UNUSUAL FOR SOCKS! THEY FIT & FEEL SO GOOD----PURE COTTON WITH JUST ENOUGH GIVE, LAUNDER BEAUTIFULLY, & LAST ALMOST FOREVER! I LOOK EVERYWHERE TO FIND THIS BRAND---THE ONLY SOCKS I'LL WEAR!"
3,gold toe socks,"Everything was great, but I thought the socks were 100% cotton and they turned out to be a blend. If I bought them at a local store, I would have returned them. Since it was an internet purchase, it was too much trouble to return. That is all.PS..I just reviewed the original Amazon ad and it specified that the item was luxurious pima cotton, but it also said '32%' nylon. So this was my oversight."
3,Useful but poorly designed,"I am a little displeased with this item. Installation is no big deal, but lining up the rear rail clip vertically such that the fence smoothly glides across the table, yet locks smoothly, is nearly impossible. Pliers required to fine-tune the fit. Moreover, the needle indicator is sufficiently long to allow an accurate read on the cm side of the fence scale rule, but not the inch side. On my front rail, the stick-on rule is actually not parallel to the rail and table, and it came this way. So the upshot is use a conbination square to measure your cuts for this one. Finally, I have seen much better online deals for this fence. On the plus side, it does permit a very stable cut - I have shaved 1/8"" veneers from 6 inch tall maple with reasonable precision, and it really helps, along with a featherboard, for resawing to make bookmathced cabinet door panels."
5,Fabulous for Desert Dwellers (or for coming off a plane),"I am pretty skeptical when it comes to stuff like this. A watery mist seems pretty stupid to me. I bought it on a whim when I decided to give myself a facial on vacation. It was one of the best purchases for my skin I've ever made. It's clearly not just a watery useless spray.In fact, I don't know if I've ever noticed such a difference in my skin with any other product. That may sound silly to you, but I live in Arizona and it is dry as a bone here. I put on my regular moisturizer and then spray this on my face, let it dry a little bit before I put any make up on, and my face stays moisturized but doesn't get super oily in spots that normally would. I break out less when I use this stuff, too.Of course, everyone's body chemistry is different, but people should definitely give this stuff a try (and they don't sell it at Sephora, I've tried)."
1,Waste of money,"Like many others I wanted to extend Eclipse so I can be more productive. Unfortunately I found this book to be poorly written and the technical details vague. I know what I want to do, but the book (over 1000 pages) does not show me how?!It explains the Eclipse architecture and idea goals which is fine but is repeated over and over again in various chapters of the book. I also could not get a handle on how it can be applied. This is not a practical guide to Eclipse. It is more about Eclipse's internal design which for most people is a waste of time. The online documents are more useful.Note the book is also out of date. I tried to follow some of their sparse examples, but I quickly realized it's a waste of time because I have the latest Eclipse 3.11 installed and the examples were for Eclipse 3.0 and the menu options and API have changed. All in all, this book was a real let down."
4,"Good book, bad approach","The book is very good. The problem is the examples. The examples are all heavily loaded and compounded. Like when you want to learn a certain type of a tree, instead you will be put into a dense forest and lost totally. I do not recomend the beginner to start with this book. I want the author to redesign the examples so that the topic be focused."
4,Excellent Resource,Is an excellent book even till date insipte of the fact lot of things have changed. Am very satisfied with it.
1,Tiny book,Be warned that the size of this version of this book is unusually small. It is too difficult to read the print or enjoy the pictures in this copy. Waste of money!!!!
4,Fun,"Hermit crab works through fears of change and moving from one shell to another. Throughout he makes new friends and learns it's ok to say goodbye to the those friends too.Great way to introduce the concepts of moving, making new friends and saying good bye to friends for young children.My beginning reader loves Eric Carle's colorful pictures and easy to read words and having a hermit crab which he's fascinated by draws him in."
5,"good story, but small size book . didn't know it was a small hardback",The story and pictures are good. Amazon represented it as a hardback. Sent a small hardback. Makes me leary of buying children's books from Amazon
3,Way too small,"Great book but this copy is way too tiny. I did not read the dimensions before ordering, so I was not aware that the book would be palm sized. I cannot use this book as I intended (to read aloud to my kindergarten class), as they would not even be able to see the pictures. The item description should clearly state that this is a mini version of the book."
5,Science and Literacy Connection,"A House for Hermit Crab is a delightful book - Eric Carle's illustrations are phenominal, as always. As children's literature, a great tale of friendship and sharing, and a great tie-in to our seashore/hermit crab science unit. Children learn to identify many sea creatures who are characters in the story, and reading the story to my students reinforced our discussions of how the hermit crab moves to a new shell when he outgrows his old one. A great way to tie literature to content areas."
1,Need glasses?,"This book is amazingly small with very tiny print! I had no idea of the size when I ordered it. If I had seen it in a store, I would have passed it right by!"
3,Teeeensy tiny book,"5 stars for the great story and beautiful artwork, as always, but 1 star for the eensy weensy teeny size of this book (which I admit I could have been prepared for had I scrolled down to product size, but who does that?!): it's about 4"" x 5"", which makes it good for travel but prone to misplacement. Plus, my son is just turning 3, and little books are tough for him to handle. I guess this will be one step on the road to perfecting his fine motor skills!"
2,Too Small,"This is a tiny book. It is too small for little hands. It won't stay open. For a book on the go, I would recommend a board book."
5,Great book for kids,This is a terrific book for kids which helps them relate to change and moving on. My daughter took it to school and her class loved it. It's her favorite bedtime story.
2,Size is deceptive,"I purchased this book, thinking it was a ""normal"" size book. It just arrived in the mail and is one of the smallest books I've ever seen! It's only about 5 1/2"" long by 4"" wide, which makes the font very, very small & hard to read, esp for my 6 year old. Very disappointed. When I order books, I expect to actually get books, not a mini book. If it's going to be smaller than an average size book, it should be described as such. If I would have known, I would have looked for a bigger one."
2,Blue Screen of Death,"I tried calling customer support, but after spending an hour on the phone with a very nice lady in India, we determined that the device simply wouldn't work with the version of XP running on my machine. I was told that I wasn't the first person who had reported the problem of the driver causing XP driven systems to crash. So, I'm back to my Linksys A/B USB that can't hold a signal for very long. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is that before it crashes, it does always seem to get a nice strong signal. If only D-Link could hire someone to create drivers for them, I wouldn't be looking for a new devicse."
2,Does not handle hibernate/stand by modes. Gives Blue screen crashes on Windows XP,"I have been using it on a desktop (XP Media center 2005) fir a year now.The adapter's driver is problematic. Whenever I resume from hibernate or standby, the driver crashed my computer. Talked to tech support and they could not help me at all. (I had followed all the directions specified in the manual for its installation).So I currently don't hibernate my PC :(Works well on a freshly restarted machine though...Unless they have an updated driver, I would not recommend buying this. (I am using the driver it shiped with and have not seen any updates to it on dlink's web site)"
3,blue screen of death on usb equipment ....,"when usb card or device uses more electricity ten the usbport can offer (usually 500ma) it goes to blue screenespecially on laptops...and on small pc s.the reason i think is with in the 108 acceleraton argorythmthat could suck up more than usb port can give , hence error occurs.so if you dont want your pc/laptop to go blue ,dont use the super-G mode.i think 5ghz router users must have a backup adapter like thisat hand."
2,D-Link DWL-AG132 Compact Wireless USB 2.0 Adapter,Well I thought this product will be good based on some other reviews elsewhere but I am very disappointed. On two differrent PC's the divers caused a bluescreen (Windows XP SP2). This product is so new that Dlink don't even have the drivers on their website (drivers supplied on CD). As ususal it takes DLINK 5 software versions to get it right!!
2,Couldn't wait to finish,"Though I'm a great fan of Gleick's other books, I found Faster annoying in the extreme. True, it is replete with fascinating facts and insights. After a couple of chapters, however, many of its fascinating facts and insights -- not infrequently organized into endless prose lists -- began to feel like so many bricks to the skullcap, waterdrops to the forehead, ... Enough was enough was enough. I listened to Faster (audiotape) on my commute to work. Mornings 3-8 felt like Groundhog Day. F(un/interesting 15 page magazine article) + C(affeine) + OCD + T(ime) +/- P(er-word-payment) = Faster."
3,Collection of interesting essays,"This book was not really a book, but a series of essays on time. While I found most of the essays interesting, the book lacked an overall thesis or theme to pull it all together. Many of the essays were contradictory (which is fine, but needs resolution). I loved Gleick's biography of Richard Feynman so I was a little disappointed by this book. However, it is well worth a read to have yourself think about how you use time in your own life."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"Having read Chaos, I was surprisingly disappointed with Faster. Gleick seemed to want to write about so many things, but never really had much more than a few short factoids about each. I was rather disappointed to find whole chapters of a topic comprising less than FOUR pages of text. Yes, this book is a fast read. So, for the person who seeks notches on his bookshelf, this is certainly a book for you! Of course Gleick discusses some very intriguing items concerning time, but unfortunately his execution falls a bit short of his other work."
5,"Move over John A. McPhee, coming through","The master of important trivia, John A. McPhee ""Oranges"" ISBN: 0374226881, is about to be surpassed by James Gleick, ""The Acceleration Guy."" The history of chronometry will never be the same. His insights on elevators are uplifting. He discuses the type-A personality and its misconceptions. I will not go through every subject as you do not have TIME to read this review, but I was surprised to find out what ""God's speed"" meant.Faster: Our Race Against Time"
4,I could hardly wait to read this book,"There's only one bad thing about James Gleick's Faster.. reading it you are constantly aware that you really do live at a much faster rate than you used too.As always, a detailed look at life from a different perspective. Enjoyed learning about the effects and reasons we feel that things are speeding up."
4,An interesting read,"There are some interesting anecdotes in this book, and I think it succeeds in making you contemplate the speed and rush with which we occupy our daily lives. (After reading this book, I now look at 'door close' buttons in elevators in a totally different light!) Where it falls down is in its style. It loses impact because of the very fact it is simply recounted as a series of 'interesting anecdotes' or examples, with little if any nexus linking one to the next (from telephones to elevators, from clocks to computers). Nevertheless, an interesting read which I'd recommend."
2,Faster: A List of Facts and Speculations,"I obviously did not conducting enough research before buying this book. I am seventeen and this was an easy read, but I was hoping for and expecting a philosophical examination of our speedy lives. Instead I was bombarded by semi-interesting, useless facts about how our world has been struck by ""hurry-sickness"" and how everything has been accelerated (a fairly obvious fact).If you are consious enough of our world to buy this book (because of its title) for yourself, it will not raise you conciousness with any deep philosophical questions or with any solutions. The only people who will benefit from this book are the ones who will never buy it for themselves. Therefore I believe this book is basically useless and slightly boring."
4,"... - fun, but there's not much point","This is an entertaining and thought-provoking book, but it does not bring much new information to the table. Gleick's other books, like ""Chaos,"" explain complex concepts to the reader in an understandable way. ""Faster"" does not really express much that the reader could not have worked out for him/herself on serious reflection. There is not actually anything wrong with that, but if you were expecting something along the lines of ""Chaos,"" you might be disappointed.Another reviewer said he/she could not find time for Gleick's conclusions. As far as I can tell, there are not really any conclusions. This is a little frustrating; the implication throughout the book is that the acceleration of everything is A Bad Thing, but it is never stated outright and so no argument is there to be challenged.""Faster"" is a quick, easy read that will leave you thinking about the acceleration of modern life, but will not give you much new information to ponder."
4,Frst 'mprssns,"Read the first chapter today over breakfast ;-) Loved it, esp. the way it ends: Sophocles said Time was a gentle deity, but, nowadays, it cracks the whip.Was quite intrigued by the cover of the hardcover edition. You can guess the words; but, without the vowels, they look as if they have lost their soul.Plan to read the rest of the book when in a traffic jam, which someone has described as the preserve of the motorist (pun intended)."
2,Interminable,"Clearly, I had false expectations. I had heard much of this book and expected something more insightful than the actuality.Gleick's book is anything but fast. It is slow, ponderous and desperately in search of meaning. It is one long series of trite anecdotes.As an airport book merely serving to while away some hours on a long distance flight, ""Faster"" may be useful. However, even this is probably stretching the reality. Overall, the book is anything but fast and I would encourage readers to search elsewhere for a more meaningful view of modern life."
2,One Long Editorial,"I bought this because I really enjoyed James Gleick's ""Chaos"". This however was a *MAJOR* dissapointment. It is one long 300 page editorial complaining about the pace of life in our times. The last two chapters are a meandering philosophical essay on..... well actual I'm not sure. It did not make much sense. An interesting book if you want to read about *how* the pace of life has changed, but not very informative."
3,no time for gleick,"perhaps succumbing to his own brand of hurry sickness, james gleik's 'faster' is a quick read to delight and entertain. although it is well written and credible in all ways, in the end i found that i had no time to spend on his conclusions. so i dropped the book.after several good introductory chapters, gleick falls into a rut describing how fast some other element of american society has become. this quickly (how quickly? very quickly) put the kibosh on my interest. although the content seems destined for bobo conversation, i found it little more than extended vignettes filling sound-bites into full length chapters and then chapters into a book. it made the whole enterprise seem reverse engineered around a series of simple ""aha's"" that would be better served by a juicy piece of fiction by michael crichton."
2,Not Fast Enough,"Gleick's slim little book about the quickening pace of...well, everything...turned out to be surprisingly tedious. The book's main drawback is that it's nothing more than a collection of loosely related anecdotes: how airline scheduleing software optimizes plane routes, how call switching programs handle zillions of calls, how movies are compressed into MTV-like bursts, how modern audiences can't sit still for a full symphony, etc. (If lists like this actually interest you, you might like ""Faster"".) While there are plenty of discreet observations of quick ""stuff"", there's almost no analysis to speak of, no discussion of the implications of this increasing quickness or speculation on where it might ultimitely lead.The writing style is largely glib and ironic, offering the reader little substance to chew on. A prime example of the irony of this book is the fact that many of the chapters are only three pages long."
4,Good unit,"Loved my little unit which I only had for about two weeks, before it was stolen from my car. Directions were pretty good. Only problem I had was I used it in Washington DC. Not much signal in the downtown area by the Capitol and Smithsonian Museums, which I attributed to the signals probably being blocked by the government satellites. I will be buying a replacement... same one of course"
4,Pretty accurate,"Nuvi 270 works well, but, some areas are outdated roadnames. Other than that it works excellently ."
3,Not useful in Vienna,"I bought this GPS for a trip to Vienna, Austria. The first four times I turned it on, I was not able to find a satellite. I thought something was wrong with the unit. Finally, on my last day there, it did find satellites. I used it in pedestrian mode, but while on trams, it cound not keep up. It was useless when we went into the subway, Hofburg Palace, or near tall buildings like St. Stephens. So while it was fun at times, it was not useful for me on this trip."
2,Returned,"I bought this as a Xmas gift but wound up returning it. I'm sure it is a fine product, but was missing a key feature that my Nuvi 260 has - turn by turn voice with street names. This is a feature key to the needs of the person I bought it for."
1,Horrible,The routes that this thing selects are horrible. There is a major highway between here and where I wanted to go. For some reason it kept choosing longer more awkward routes.
5,high quality,Bought as a xmas gift and got a lot of use out of it. Would buy product again as another gift
2,GPS for Dummies,"Garmin must have taken to heart the generally-accepted fact that Americans simply won't read instruction manuals--so they didn't write one.This unit is designed to be operated by persons who can intuitively divine how to make it function after glancing at the truly-quick-start information. For you, this will do the job.For the rest of us, who might enjoy taking advantage of the many advanced features of this unit--well, too bad. Garmin won't even reply to emails requesting additional information on the unit's capabilities.So you'll pay better than a hundred dollars for a highly capable electronic device and--if you're the curious type--you'll spend a fair amount of time wondering how to make it perform its tricks.For my money, I'd rather have a well-written manual. It would have earned this unit at least one more star.(Disclaimer: My Garmin 270was a promotional gift.)"
2,no text to speech.,"We ended up also ordering the 260 cause even though the 270 is more expensive it does not have text to speech. We didn't need the european maps cause we probably wont be going and I heard that they don't pick up signals in most of the european countries. In all I would say, if you only want to use it in America go with the 260, much better deal."
5,Will this work in Mexico?,"Hi, I'm planning on buying this product since I often travel to the U.S., but I would like to know if it works in Mexico.Can anyone tell me if this is possible?I would appreciate any help."
3,Garmin Nuvi 270 review,"It does NOT have bluetooth, wireless calling, mp3 player, or FM traffic Receiver. It does have the pre-loaded Euro map. And it fits in the pocket well. Also, one has to buy the overpriced wall Charger seperate. I feel I got my moneys worth. The trouble is, unless you study, you don't know what extra's you have or don't have. The 270 does NOT have the antenna that flips up on the back.It does have a slot for an SD card. But since I do not know what that is, and it really doesn't explain anywhere that I can find, who knows if that is a good thing or not?"
4,Works well!,"Bought the Garmin Nuvi 270 because it included European maps. Had just had a difficult experience in Europe. Used this unit on second trip to Europe (within in six weeks). Proved most helpful; even invaluable. Have also since used it in US. Typical little GPS errors now and then, but overall, VERY helpful. Have since used it in US with rental cars, and feel it is well worth the cost!!"
4,Great Navigator!,"We have just returned from a two week driving vacation inGermany, Austria, and Switzerland. From autobahn to streets, some alleys, country roads and what seemed to be paved goat paths, the Garmin nuvi 270 got us where we needed to go! While the documentation was not comprehensive, the menu features were simple enough to use and understand. The only drawback was (and we may not have found that feature in the menu) having a total km only to the next turn, but not to the end destination. You can set the navi to off-road and get a total to destination ""as the crow flies"". Well worth the investment!"
5,Worked great for our trip to Italy,"We bought this Garmin 270 in early March (2009), and it has performed very well for us. We used it daily during our trip to northern Italy, and its driving directions were concise and the maps were accurate. It was a lifesaver for us - I can't imagine using paper road maps instead!About the only complaint we had was that this Garmin can take a little time to 'recalculate' directions when you've missed a turn. But, that's a small complaint - the overall performance and user-friendliness of this Garmin unit was terrific!Ironically, I haven't used it much in the U.S. yet, but IMO this Garmin GPS has already paid for itself during our trip to Italy! Considering the current Amazon price of ~$140 (and Free Shipping!), this is an outstanding value for a US/Europe GPS unit.HIGHLY recommended."
4,Garmin nuvi 270 review,I am very hapy with this product as I did some research on the product before purchasing it. It does more than what I was expecting.
3,"Garmon Nuvi 370 3.5"" screen","If you're looking for a Nuvi unit that has the voice directions PLUS the street names, DON'T BUY THE 270 model!!!!! I had used the 260 model and it was wonderful, as you heard not only when to turn right or left, but also the street name to turn on. I thought the upgraded 270 would at least have this nice feature -- and the description on Amazon doesn't state that it doesn't voice street names -- so I bought it and am very disappointed. And now when I try to return it for a refund, Amazon is not going to refund all of my money, due to the fact that the item has been opened and used. Well, of course it's been opened & used -- how else would one know that the voice directions are totally inadequate??!! Just be careful when ordering a unit. The voice stuff is not the same from unit to unit. (I won't buy from Amazon again!)"
4,Satellite Reception fine in Paris,"The purpose of this review is simply to report that I purchased one of from Amazon in the US and used it for a day or two in Southern California where it worked fine, then took it to Paris, France where it also works just fine walking around. It's first satellite acquisition in the morning sometimes takes a couple minutes, but it always acquires, usually in a few seconds, even in narrow streets with buildings on either side.I will note that there was an available firmware upgrade for mine that I installed before using it. I mentione this because possibly the issues others have with satellite acquisition are fixed with later firmware.BTW I'm not new to GPS. This is about my 10th receiver, starting back with the Garmin GPS12; the point being I'm familiar with the norms for GPS performance."
5,Excellent Value,"Seven days before my wife and I left for Spain, a friend told us about the Nuvi 270, I went ahead and bought one, receiving it 3 days before we left. From the moment I plugged it into the rental car,I was amazed how easy it was to use and how accurate the directions were. Any address we needed in both Spain & Portugal, the Nuvi 270 took us to the front door. As the week progressed, I also started using the other functions (currency converter, distance converter, etc.)and getting more familar with all it had to offer. We drove 1800 miles in 10 days and as I said to my wife a thousand times, I couldn't imagine doing this without the Garmin Nuvi 270."
5,Excellent GPS,"Garmin nüvi 270 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorUsed it in New York City during my last visit there. A very neat, user friendly and quickly responding GPS. Since my return home, I ordered the free European maps update-2009. I propose that the USB connection cable be included in the package. Had to order it separately from Amazon UK. A pity that still no maps for Israel are available."
2,Go for newer version,"My older GPS behaved as nuvi 255 though it was marked as nuvi 250. And it was much better than this nuvi 270 (except missing maps). This leads me to a conclusion that this older version is not worth the money and we returned it.Here are the most noticeable differences:Faster start.Much faster search for satelites.Arrows in top bar to give you quick info where you will turn next.It is off by hundreds of feets and it takes a while until it fixes position (tried in bay area, CA and South Lake Tahoe, CA)If you have nothing to compare with you can be happy. There are good maps and it finds reasonable routes. Recalculating works OK too. But if you know that it can perform better you will likely prefer improved model.BTW: we looked for some places in Czech Republic (Europe) and it looks good even though Garmin writes that the map coverage is not complete. Fresh and complete enough for us to find all places we've tried."
3,Garmin nuvi 270 with European maps,"Product arrived quickly, seller did a great job on that.However, I have some critisizm for the product itself - the maps of Europe were very out of date, some countries had maps from the Soviet era!!!! That's aprox. 18-20 years old. Bigger countries, like England, France and Italy were a little better, but you can't reach them, without crossing the small ones, and that's where we ran into problems.Thankfully, Garmin offers ONE free map update. That helped out a lot."
4,Garmin Nuvi is a Life Saver,"We were travelling to Europe and bought Garmin Nuvi specifically because it had the maps for both North America and Europe. We rented a car in Zurich and drove through Switzerland, Austria and Germany. Other than very small towns, Garmin was able to locate the destinations and guide us succesfully. However, the pedestrian mode did not work too well in the streets and downtown Zurich.Overall, it was a life saver and it made our drive very pleasurable. Would highly recommend it if you are planning to drive and are not familiar with the roads in the area.It also helped us locate hotels/points of interest/restaurants.Two thumbs up"
4,Garmin 270,"The Garmin arrived sooner than they promised. From the descriptions I knew exactly what I am getting. I am pretty satisfied woth the product and the price was very low. I alrady have a Garmin Nuvi and I decided to buy this one because it has both US and European maps, and the price was identical to the European map upgrade for my existing Garmin."
4,not lost anymore,We purchased this after we borrowed one to go to Kansas City and after we got lost using MapQuest. We usually know where we are going but have had 3 occasions to use it since we've had it. One time we just bought a new car and wanted to go to dinner after picking up the car. It got us there without one recalculation. We bought this model because we are going to Paris next year and want to use it there.
4,Great for the Price,"I purchased this along with the case, screen protector and dash mount. The case is snug but does protect the unit well. I have found the menus easy to use, adjustable screen size is great, small enough to put in the glove box so it is out of sight. The voice can be irritating if you don't follow the driving directions and it has to recalculate. We just laughed, is sounds like you are being scolded. I bought a second one for my daughter. Maps are very accurate. I like the colored lines for the different types of roads."
4,Garmin GPS 270nuvi,"The Garmin GPS is so easy to use and it has actually saved us money with travel expenses. I have set it for the most direct route. On one trip across 12 states, we later found that by following the Garmin route, we had cut over 115 miles off our trip. That was at a time that gas prices was well over $3 a gallon, so we felt that we most likely paid for the Garmin with the gas that we saved with it's route calculations.I only gave it a 4 star due to one small flaw we have found. Twice, we have programed an address and when we arrived at our destination, the business had moved. I am not sure how often business places are updated, but that was somewhat of an annoyance. The Garmin did take us there, the information just had not been updated from the business...we went to the old address instead of the newer one that opened about 8 mos. ago.Otherwise, this is a great product and was a fantastic price from Amazon.com. I saved over $200 by comparing prices and shopping with Amazon.com!"
4,Used it all over Europe & it worked pretty good!,Used this for our two week trip in Europe (France & Germany). Worked great---little hard sometimes with putting in the right addresses--but could not have managed without it.
1,Garmin nuvi,"I was very disappointed. The maps were over 5 years old that came with my Garmin, so to find locations in U.S and Europe were very frustrating."
5,My friends want to know what is my GPS model!,"I brought this Nuvi 270 GPS less than 3 months ago because I had friends coming to visit me from Taiwan & they need a GPS speak multi-languages.This GPS not only speaks Chinese very well but also portable, with Europe map .....Strongly recommend this GPS specially if you may visit Europe or need a foreign language speaking GPS!!!!Eileen"
2,Useless European Maps,"I've been using this 270 for at least 4 years now. Every year we go to Europe for months and every year I get frustrated the 270 cannot find addresses, or even towns for that matter. So, this year I updated my map set, not a cheap proposition. The 2012 map set is even worst than those of prior years. Again, I am sitting here in Switzerland, entering streets that are hardly off the beaten path and having the Garmin not able to locate a street with that name. Went so far as to enter English spellings where appropriate. NADA.If you are purchasing this for European travel, get a TomTom. Or use Google maps as, in the case of both Switzerland and Italy, they are far more complete and accurate. I say this after over a decade to this area and the Garmin map sets are useless."
5,Works Great!,"This was a birthday gift for my husband. Gleaned through many systems before deciding on this one.I was looking for a portable model, and good design. This model comes with pre-loaded European Maps, and for me it offered more value compared to the other models. Also purchased the travel kit; comes with global extension plugs.We have been very happy using this model; the voice command is wonderful, and so far it has tackled all our ""challenge"" tests with no error."
4,Good value,"A very good value for the money, with both N American and European maps pre-loaded. Its small size makes it easy to travel with. I've used it on both continents and it works quite well, or at least up to my expectations. It seems to get confused occasionally, but usually sorts itself out if given 30 seconds. Of course, 30 seconds can be a long time when you're driving through the middle of a large foreign city, so I'd be even happier if this never happened. The only real oddity I could cite is the tendency for the verbal instructions to be overly detailed, even to the point of confusion initially. Rather than telling you to go straight at an intersection, it will tell you to 'keep right' or 'keep left' unless the intersection is exactly 90 degrees. You get used to it, but it's weird."
5,Get Movin',"My stepdaughter is going to be a nanny overseas for a year and wanted a GPS with European maps. This fit the bill. She is still in the U.S. right now, but it is getting her everywhere she wants to go."
5,Excellent Product - Highly recoomneded,"To be honest, i dont know why anyone would buy anything else. Exteremely helpful, I used this all over Ireland, all over england, and back in the northeast of the US. This has not let us down once. Quick to respond, doesnt take long to load, very easy to use and very affordable compared to other brands. This garmin is excellent!"
4,Strong performer,I purchased the nuvi 270 for the help navigating around the English countryside. The European maps are a great value compared to a nuvi 250 and add-on maps.The unit performed very well here in the states and then made driving in the English countryside possible. I don't know what we would have done without it. I suppose only tour buses and easy to get to tourist sites.Only gripes are it can send you to very small or restricted roads. Also the pedestrian mode was spotty in London.
3,Make sure you buy a USB connector,"I have only used the 270 a few days in the US, and it seems to work as advertised. They only suggestion is that you also purchase a necessary USB cable for the unit. Without it, you can't register it online, and receive any updated software. This is something that was missing in the Amazon description and needs to be added."
2,My Nuvi 270 died in 40 days,"I bought Nuvi for vacation trip in Spain. Maybe, map was too old. GPS directions were confusing in 30%. Sometimes GPS advised to exit highway just 80 km before destination point or just was showing car off road between mountains. Once we made a complete loop following directions and had to start over. The most curios case was on the one lane old bridge when GPS pushed on us to make u-turn immediately but was agree to drive straight ahead another 30km just one minute later ...Finally, my Nuvi 270 died in 40 days."
5,Marvelous navigator!,I just returned from a long and complicated trip in the USA. It always guided me to the final destination.
5,"Garmin Nuvi 270 Navigator-Europe,USA","We bought this product based on such great reviews and have not been disappointed. The nuvi 270 gets you where you need to go with ease and I can't wait to use it for bigger trips, especially in Europe, avoiding those paper maps whenever possible in favor of the nuvi and site seeing. The cost was much better than in local electronic stores with models that did not include Europe. I could not find this version in our local electronic stores and it would have cost approx. $200 to upgrade the North American version to include Europe. This one has it all and my husband couldn't be happier!"
4,Great Price!,"The Garmin nuvi 270 was a great GPS for the price considering it included maps of North America and Europe.Unfortunately, the USB cable was an option that had to be purchased separately. In order to register the unit with Garmin, the USB cable was required.Upon registering the nuvi 270, Garmin gave you a choice to update either the map of North America or Europe, not both. The extra cost to update both maps almost equaled the price of the unit.All in all, a great GPS for the price."
4,Good GPS device,"The GPS navigator is very neat. I like the way it recalculates your trip when you need to take a detour. I would have preferred if it spoke out the names of the streets. However, I've gotten used to looking at the top of the display to see the name where i need to turn"
3,"Good, but not for everyone","I bought this present for my parents who are in their 70s and not at all computer savvy. They travel by car quite a bit however, and sometimes in Europe. They are having some trouble because there's not always a 'back' button to push, or clear indications on how to change a screen (e.g. from map to text). Also, it would be nice for the screen to be larger. I think overall it is a good product, but I'm still looking for something that is user-friendly for everyone."
3,points of interest problem,"unit had trouble locating points of interest. no problem if you had the address. also, newer maps were available, but download was 5-8 hours using an institutional dsl line."
3,Can't be registered without cable that isn't included.,"I am so far pleased with the nuvi 270, but I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the fact that you can't register it with Garmin without connecting it to a computer with internet access, *which requires a cable they don't include with the nuvi!!!!* In my opinion this is simply outrageous. You should not require extraneous hardware to register a legitimately purchased product."
2,Mediocre GPS,Basic GPS. Does not speak street names. Does not have lane assist. OK for basic a US and European GPS.
4,For a few dollars more...,"Bought this unit, and then discovered I needed a unit that provided Bluetooth and Spoken Street names capability. Returned it for the Garmin Nuvi 360, and am very happy with the 360."
3,Nuvi GPS,I used this GPS in France traveling into the rural areas and had some problems locating small villages and roads. Also wanted to use it in London but it has trouble finding satelites when you are traveling along streets with very tall buildings. Still a good GPS
4,Garman 270,Very good product. Has European and Canadian maps. Does everything I need. It is not voice activated but I can live with that cause it's so easy to enter an address. It seems to know where you are going before you finish your entry.
3,Garmin,"The Garmin I am sure works like all the other GPS--I have no sense of direction so I figured it would come in handy. This weekend I went on a trip and used it for the first time. I missed my turn due to heavy traffic and not being able to make the right turn. Instead of having me back track it totally re calculated the route taking me thru all the backroads for at least a half hour. Finally after talking to my daughter I ignored the Garmin and got back to main roads and found my way home., took me at least a half hour longer. It can be a good instrument but maybe it should have a choice of State Roads or country Roads. Because believe me they were country I never met a car and never saw a gas station or store...I will use it again but now know if I miss a turn to ignore the GPS turn around and let it re calculate for the main road like I probably originally had."
4,garmin nuvi 270,"I own several Garmins, including a 345, street pilot 2720, zumo on a motorcycle. This one has excellent graphics and is easy to see in bright light. The routes it picks when I use it locally(where I know the routes) are sometimes illogical, which gives me less confidence when I use it away from home. It doesn't readily accept alternative destinations to knowing an actual street address and is not as user friendly as I think it should be after so many generations have been developed by Garmin and other manufacturers. I do like it, but am a little disappointed. I have not had the oppurtunity to use it in Europe yet, which is the reason I chose the 270."
4,great in usa..not so great in Italy,"I love the Garmen 270 in the usa. It is easy to read and I use it frequently. However it did not help in Venice, Italy or Florence, Italy. I could not get oriented in either city."
4,What you'd expect from a GPS,"first i have an older Garmin i5 GPS. it was smaller in screen size, but bulky and you had to rotate a dial to spell addresses out, etc. that was really crummy. but the nice thing about it is that it could acquire the satellites very quickly -- perhaps within about 30 seconds. the Nuvi 270 is slow to acquire satellites. i regularly drive about 2 minutes before it finally figures out where i am to give me directions. if i know i am going to be using it i guess i should turn it on before i start the car if i really don't know which way to go from my starting point.that being said, everything else is really, really well done. you can type right on the screen and you can do it while driving. i purchased the weighted stand for keeping it on the dash and the combo can't be beat. we're off to Europe for a few months soon so i'll likely have more to add to this review once i've tried this GPS from Italy to Amsterdam."
4,Nuvi 270,"I have been using it in nothern Italy and it works well (most of the time). When we were in Vicenza, we were looking for a McDonalds late at night and it took us to a remote area. Other than that it has been working good. I have not been to a city where it has been congested with tall buildings.I was about to purchase the Nuvi 370 because it tells you the street names. Because of the different langauges, I thought it would be easier to just turn (left or right) at the command of the 270. Also the street names are not always posted and I prefer to keep my eyes on the road!If you're going to travel (drive) in Europe I would recommend the Nuvi 270.Also I can charge my Nuvi through the computer's USB terminal.It's very easy to use! I purchased it through amazon.com for $169.99.Arrivederci"
5,Easy to use: don't pay list price!,"I found this to be very easy to use and quite intuitive. I bought the optional bean-bag mount, which works better than the suction cup mount. The Nuvi is quite expensive at list price, but good value at (Amazon) discount price. The embedded list of places of interest is a bit limited, but adequate. Entering addresses is very easy."
4,Pretty good GPS,"I bought this GPS in November 2008, and I think its a good gps for long drives mostly on freeway, but not on streets...battery life is not goodbut overall its good!"
3,"garmin 270, used in New York State","We used the system for the first time this weekend and had two different experiences--one in which we were completely satisfied, and one where we were a bit amused, but disappointed. The latter involved veering off the course proscribed by the GPS, because we actually knew a shorter, easier route for the initial part of the journey. After we made our detour, and were back on the recommended route, the GPS seemed a bit undone--it recommended getting off at every single exit on the Thruway!!!But when we followed its directions exactly, it was great."
4,What a time/frustration saver!,"We received a Garmin Nuvi from our daughter & son-in-law prior to a 2-month trip to Alaska and couldn't believe how easily we could find the nearest Walmart, certain brands of gas, or the dentist office in an emergency. When we got home, they asked to borrow it, so we decided to get them the Garmin Nuvi 270 for Christmas. They've had a ball with it in just the short time they've had it. Also got a GREAT price on it at Amazon!"
3,Not accurate,"I have found this GPS to only be accurate about 50% of the time. A few times, just playing with it, I'd enter a place I was going that I already knew how to get to and thank goodness I did because if I had followed the GPS directions, I never would have arrived at my destination. Disappointing."
2,NOT THE CATWOMAN WE KNOW,First off 1)Catwoman in the comics was white not black like others have written.2)In the Adam west Burt ward Batman series she was white Julie Newmar- black Eartha Kitt- and the 1966 movie white- Lee meriwether.3) Halle berry is half black half white. But that is not why I gave it 2 stars I would not care if she was all black or latin or ect.... I gave it 2 stars because you can not change a comic characters orgin this much and still think people will come and see it. Granted Catwoman has changed over the years but somethings have always stayed the same She is a catburgler with no super powers. That is what made Catwoman and Batman so cool the ability to do what they do WITH NO SUPER POWERS!. Will people go see this movie- yes because Halle berry is SUPER HOT but even she can not save this stinker of a movie.
3,A blackcatwoman... big deal,"I gave it three stars even though Ive never seen it, because I like the idea of having them use a black catwoman. I remember hearing somebody said catwoman is white. Sowhat if they use a black woman to play catwoma, she's a cat, have ya'll never seen a black cat before. People are making a big deal out of the fact that she is black, so what. Maybe down the line they will use a white woman to play catwoman. But for now Halle is catwoman!! deal with it!!"
4,I liked it!,"I'm not sure why the hate on here is so deep, but I liked Catwoman. Nevermind that Halle is my favorite, I liked the truth behind it. You gotta kick someone's azz if they kill you (or try to). Not only did she solve the crime, but she does a nice job at getting her own revenge. I do think the movie is a little slow and what not, but I also think it is good at the same time. I'll see it at least one more time. I need to see the parts I missed because of using the bathroom. All in all, wihtout giving away the story I think it's a nice movie for the family to see."
5,Catwoman!!!,"I have read the reviews for this movie and I don't think it is going to be that bad because it is based on a comic book and so far I have liked all the comic based moviews. The only think I don't like, is that it comes out in theatres too late because that is when it should have came out on DVD and VHS. Anyways it is going to be better than the Batman movie with Catwoman because this movie is only about catwoman and as always it tells how she came to be the catwoman. Halle Berry is excellent for this movie and so is Sharon Stone. So it might me a good movie.Catwoman was a worker at a company that makes skin lotion but when she uncovered a dirty secret, she was thrown off the balcony and was killed. Somehow the cats brought life in catwoman again and gave her strenght, agility, and better sight. This is the story of Catwoman. It's going to be a good movie."
5,Catwoman Brings out the Dog in Me,"Bark! There goes that catwoman. So detested by every critic and fan because of what it didn't do. They lack imagination. The production design is as cute as Berry and is 'pretty' instead of looking bad*ss. Story is light as a twinkie and less harmful; but lacks the darkness and source elements. I liked its feminine, cat voodoo-babble and Disney-Naughty style. It's another film people love to hate, that I like. The picture is great, as is the sound; but do you care?"
3,CAT...,"Blu Ray not so badly and HB is always so beautiful, the movie we like or we like not...Video: 7/10, Audio 8/10"
1,Cleavage....Cleavage....Cleavage,"The only reason to see this movie is to see Hallie in a sexy outfit. As for the movie itself, I'm sure that it will be similar to Underworld....ANOTHER TERRIBLE MOVIE.Do you know the television series ""Lost World"". Hollywood should take the staring jungle girl from that TV show and put her in a full-lenght movie. Now that would be a great idea!!!! She too also shows a lot of cleavage (Yummy)."
1,Horrible portrayal of a beloved comic book character,"I've seen some bad acting, but I don't think an ""Oscar Winner"" should act this badly in a movie. Hallie Berry, who I like as an African American actress, did a horrible job as Catwoman. Really, she was following in the steps of the lovely Michelle Phieffer, Eartha Kitt, etc. These women were sexy as Catwoman and they were vicious. More importantly, they seem to do it effortlessly. You could tell Hallie was struggling to be sexy in this movie when it should have come off naturally.The villain was just all right, nothing special.At least the fight scene at the end was okay. But the premise and acting leaves much to be desired."
1,Box office flop,IS THIS WHAT IT'S COME TO? MAKING CRAPPY MOVIES AND EXPECTING IT TO BE A HIT? THIS FILM DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT WARNER BROS HAD HOPED IT WOULD MAKE DURING OPENING WEEKEND. TAKE THAT AS A HINT!
3,Halle Fan!,"I liked the movie, eventhough most guys I talked with didn't. I think it was cute and my daughter sure loved the punch lines and the leather suit. However, I thought the writers could've put in a lot more work. Her identity was discovered too soon and the rest plot was a little flimsy. I liked the fact that this movie appealed to women, especially after watching both Spiderman and Spiderman 2! There's no comparison because women still can't seem to get enough justice :)...I can't wait to add this one to my personal collection."
3,"Good, not great","I am a little suprised by people's reactions to this film, though I guess I shouldn't be. Nice camera work, solid acting and direction. Special effects were weak - the CGI Catwoman was simply not as smooth as we have come to expect. The script was patterened around the original Catwoman comics (at least as I remember it) and likely is too pedestrian for today's audiences.THis film is by now means a 'disaster', however, it was quite entertaining. Just not aimed at anyone who thought 'Team America' was anything other than complete garbage."
4,Not bad.,I have always loved catwoman on batman and when saw her new suit on this I really did not care to much for it so I did not go to see it in the theater. Now that I have rented the dvd I cant stop watching it I had to go buy it the same day I rented it it was just cool I hope they make a part 2. I really like this better than spider-man.Rent it first then deside.
4,A human story,"This movie worked, not so much because of the action sequences which were impressive, but because of the way Halle Berry's character developed in a plausible way as she came to terms with her new abilities. The personality changes were entertaining and quite amusing. Sharon Stone, unfortunately, made a less than convincing villain and the scenes between her and Halle didn't seem to work. It was less of a typical comic-book type adventure and more of a human story, centering on one woman whose life gets turned upside down. Overall, the movie held together well and is worth seeing."
3,Blu Ray is good,"I would give the original DVD 2 stars at best, this is a pretty ordinary super hero movie, but the blu ray version looks great. Halle Berry looks great in the catsuit, the photography and some of the shots are great. All in all, a nice guilty pleasure if you like comic book superhero movies."
3,Entertaining,The film was entertaining and Halle Berry was funny and quirky. The special effects were distracting. Sharon Stone makes a great villian.
2,Copycat!,"I loved this movie until I saw ""Batman Returns"". This movie was a complete spin off of it. I mean before I saw ""Batman Returns"", I thought that the lick on the face thing was original! Don't get me wrong, it has it's moments, if it comes on HBO on demand, I recommend giving it a try. It's just that this movie is not worth watching again and again."
1,Truly awful,"This is just a ridiculously bad movie. Strictly from an action point of view, they use tons of CGI and fancy editing to cover the fact that none of the actors can do any real stunt work."
1,For Catwoman this one's a dog of a movie.,"What an embarrassment of a movie and wasted special effects. Halle Berry is an awesome and beautiful and miss-cast just because she's the flavor of the year for Hollwood - probably the only way the studio would get anyone to see it. The old addage that if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail for Hollywood and superhero movies holds true. Not every super hero needs to be reinvented and thrown up on the screen."
1,I could not even watch the whole thing....,"....and what I did watch of this trash was painful to watch.I think what really makes this 'movie' stand out as a complete flop is it's never ending corniness.. What an embarrasing, corny movie.I cannot believe I even attempted to watch this [...]This is the type of movie where you can turn it on, and at any given moment you can witness something that will make you cringe in utter disbelief.One example of this.... when 'catwoman' goes into a bar with that stupid mask, and asks for a drink.. she asks for a drink and it takes her no longer than a second or two to drink it.. she then looks at the bartender, wide eyed, and trying to look cool, as if to say ""Hey wasn't that cool?? Did that not make you think I am awesome?? It only took me a second to drink that!!""Don't waste your time with this.. I will never watch the rest of the movie, it is already, no exagerations, the worst movie I have ever seen."
4,It was very entertaining,"I enjoy comic book to big screen movies, and this was pretty entertaining. Halle Berry did a wonderful job and she wasn't suppose to be Michele Pfier, or whatever her name is...in fact, no one prrrr's better than Earther Kitt in the original television series-not even Ms. Micele! Most of these reviews weren't reviews at all; these people tried to distill all aspects of this movie while seeming more sinister than so-called critics. Perhaps they should have given the role to Brittany or that Madonna just to really get you ""critics"" talk'n...hmmm!"
2,I forgot how bad this movie was!,"I hadn't seen this movie in awhile, so I guess in memory it seemed like it was actually worth watching... definitely not the case. Fortunately I purchased it used for cheap.This movie was an absolute waste. I'm not sure the tone they were trying to set... sexy was definitely one angle and Halle Berry is hot... but if they were trying to go for edgy or action packed, that was much less successful. First, Halle Berry plays her role way too ""cute"". Definitely the opposite of Michelle Phieffer's interpretation in the Batman movie. There was also way too much use of CGI in the action sequences which was too jarring. However, tehre was some pretty cool martial arts type movies here and there. Just not enough to warrant watching the other 85 minutes of movie surrounding them."
3,MEOW! WOW! HALLE BARRY!,"Ok...the story is a little slow in some areas, but when things begin to rock, the movie rolls! Not to mention Halle Barry in the (ahem) ""catsuit"" MEOW! WOW! Also a great (ahem) ""catfight"" scene with Halle Barry & Sharon Stone.DVD contains interviews with all the women who played ""Catwoman""...Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether, Eartha Kitt & Michelle Pfieffer...and of course...Halle Barry."
2,pussy popcorn movie,"I have always enjoyed all the lovely ladies who have played the role of CATWOMAN. tv, voices, or cinema. I have never judged or tried to know the DC background of CATWOMAN. in the special features CATegory in the dvd(we get a history of who she is)-(thoughs who do not know, should see this first). however, as a movie--the movie is sort of lame, brained with no shame and is really just a popcorn movie at best(do not think-just look). the best thing about this movie: seeing HALLE BERRY in leather and oh yeah baby, CRACK THAT WHIP!!!!!---------enjoy it for what it is and nothing more."
3,Sharon STONE nude!,"Well, perhaps that would have added to the film? Of course it would have. Sharon Stone is superb as the ever-present, villian who is a true Looker. Her need to be forever young, although not a new plot line, is played gloriously by Stone. Stone is great within this mediocre collection of scenes. She truly pulls off the impossible. Stone's make-up is flawless and her intense ""eyeity"" are compelling and truly create the flame within a sinking ship. Three cheers for Stone. This film is worth it's place in your library, if only for Stone."
4,Bad repuutation,"Not awful, it's just mediocrethe acting isnt perfect, the idea is messed upbut lay back and enjoy"
1,What were they thinking!!!,"I'm trying to think of one good thing about this movie......................... oh yeah THE END!!!HB is hot, granted but his movie goes beyond stupid, I think CatYawn would have been a better name for this movie."
1,Grotesque Cat Ears!,"Ignoring the all-important fact that the catwoman in this movie is not the same character from the comics, take a gander at the dorky catwoman mask. The gay ""costume designer"" who came up with that hideous thing should be banished from Hollywood forever. Although Halle Berry is an undeniably good-looking woman, she looks anything BUT appealing wearing that dorky mask. What a travesty!"
2,Horrible but I couldn't ****STOP WATCHING****,"It was awful, I really wanted to see how it all ended so I put up with the smooth, light jazz/soft porn Muzak intertwined with some bad grrl tunes, the horrid acting and the cheesy lines and goofy computer FX to see the payoff and now I feel so ashamed, ripped off and dirty.Halle did look gorgeous, for sure she's one of the loveliest women in H-Wood, but B. Bratt is absolutely awful. I don't like him anyhow. Sharon Stone is Sharon Stone & there's nothing to be done about that.I'm gonna go fester in my guilt now."
4,"Halle ""The Cat Woman"" Berry","I just could not wait to see this movie. The visual editing on the TV commercials made it appear to be a yearly Block-Buster.Halle Berry is my GIRL! I love her to death. But the movie with its moral code ""Another Cartoon Comic"" thats out to save the world, is a familiar recurring ""motif"" that I see in ""SpiderMan and SuperMan"" Both are transformed by some higher being or inhuman power that gives them the strength to concore not only their enemies the the whole world. I really liked Halle's character, although I thought that the name Patience was just a bit too over-dramatic. Anyway, I look forward to seeing the Sequel ""Cat Woman Is Back"""
1,Catwoman smells like three week old cat litter,"You know the movie is going to be good when you want to watch the special features first. Every critic said this movie was awful and for once the critics got it right. From start to finish (and you are waiting for that finish), this movie stinks worse than kitty litter. With that said, it does have a great documentary on the history of Catwoman and how she has evolved in the comics, tv and movies. I am a comic fan, but that isn't why I hated the movie because I have always loved movies more than comics. I hated the movie because it was God awful and should have never seen the light of day. Why Bratt took a role in this thing I have no idea. Maybe he just wanted some screen time with Stone and Berry. I don't know how this movie got made, and I just pray we won't have to see Catwoman 2: Back in the Litter Box. Here's to crossing your fingers that Batman Begins will live up to the hype."
1,What in the world...,"What a waste of movie film. This is a typical example of, ""Lets use a woman who maybe considered sexy (depending on who perceiving) and market it."" If it was up to me, I'll give this a piece of a star."
3,Ammy Reviewers Should Stop Being So Catty...,"....the movie ain't *that* bad, although I wouldn't compare it to Citizen Kane. Besides, you get Berry in that Catwoman suit (Berry continues to provide some jaw dropping moments in cinema.) as well as a fight scene with Sharon Stone who coulda been a Catwoman condender herself. S'More for the Daddies in the family than for the kids...Again, I'd like to say if there's a movie made of a famous comic book character, count on these *experts* to debunk the product because it doesn't fit their mind's eye after years of studying the character....if the director doesn't exhibit some degree of pretension or geekiness, these *experts* make it harder on some productions. Bump that. See this for yourself and draw your own conclusions."
1,Cat Litter!,"This movie had some of the worst special effects I've ever seen! They were so bad, they were actually amusing. I found the acting to be terrible too. One last thought, wasn't the original Catwoman white? Avoid this one."
1,It only got one star because I couldn't give it zero.,"Everything about this movie was a mistake, including anyone who paid more than $3 to see it."
3,No need to be so catty.,"If you go to see CATWOMAN expecting to see Saving Private Ryan then you will be dissapointed, but if you go with an open mind the movie isn't that bad. It is very hard for female action stars to open movies, as much as people try to be politically correct it is very hard for people to take female movie stars seriously. Personally i enjoyed the movie, the story IS silly, but fun. Halle Berry does a good job. The action was entertaining. Anyway it is a catwoman movie so DO expect to see lots of silly cat stuff in it (eating fish, drinking milk, catty lines, etc.) deal with it. Personally i think Catwoman wouldn't care if you liked her movie or not. EP"
2,Well....Halle Berry Is In It!,The only GOOD thing I can say about this film is that Halle Berry is in it and that's about it. Not that I am much of a fan of the comic book character but the director took some serious liberties in revamping the character. It's basically NOT the Catwoman from the comic book. The villainous just seems to be a boss whose having a bad day at the office. And the battle with Catwoman seems to border on the goofy. This is great film for the MST3K treatment.
2,It has it moments,"This movie takes a long time to even get to where it's suppose to go. And honestly, I sort of enjoyed some of the cheesy dating scenes with Berry and Bratt. The whole let's sell toxic beauty cream is laughable. Why didn't she just turn in a jar of the stuff to the authorities or a newpaper organization??? But Berry does look good in her suit. I'll give her that. Stone looks good, though her acting is less than steller. But it looks like everyone agrees that the number one problem with Catwoman is the script. Was this written by a first time screenwriter? Save your money. I caught it on a slow cable night."
2,"Mildly entertaining, mostly silly and pointless","Unlike X-Men, and to a lessor degree, Spiderman, this film failed to take a comic book character and impart endearing characterization. For some reason Hollywood often forgets that story is supreme, it doesn't matter how cool the characters are.Most of the dialogue in this flick was corny or cliché and pretty predictable, and to be frank, if you want to see gratuitous shots of Halle's boobs, get the movie Swordfish. Nothing here made her character believable or really that sexy, at least in my opinion, and while I think she's a beautiful women, it's hardy enough to base a movie on.In the end, this may be worth renting and watching once, for the curiosity factor, but that's about it."
2,Don't Bother...,"If you are a fan of classic comics (as I am) you will want to see this movie just to satisify your curiousity. They say curosity killed the cat, well The cat killed this movie. Rent it if you must, but don't bother to buy it.This movie is slow to get started. Then it is unintresting in the middle. Then it only gets worse in the end.I loved both SPIDERMAN movies. I liked both X-MEN movies, DAREDEVIL was ok, and even the first two BATMAN films wern't bad.This is more like the BOMB of the HULK. A waste of time and money."
2,Not that bad of a movie.,"Eventhough it completely goes against the Batman Catwoman, if you look at this film as an outside entity, then it really isn't that bad. I had my misgivings about the costume, but in this city, in this storyline...well it does work. Halle is serviceable as Catwoman and Sharon Stone is just plain embarassing as a washed-up model. I loved the scene where Catwoman was cracking her whip in the middle of that techno club. Scenes like that worked because it was able to stand on its own. On the flipside, the CGI effects were awful. It was like watching an X-box game on the big screen. The CGI cat that ""re-awakens"" patience was equally terrible and I was a bit bummed that the cat did not stick its head in her mouth liek the one in Batman Returns. In all, not as bad flick...but the true Catwomen are Julie Newmar and Michelle Pfeiffer."
4,Halle Berry is purrr-fect,Halle Berry has got to be one of the most beautiful women on the planet and this flick is a grrrrrreat venue for her catributes.The plot is about a comic book character so I didn't take it too seriously.
2,Dead On Arrival,"I havent written a review in quite awhile, but this poorly crafted feline fiasco complelled me to pull out the ole keyboard again. Now, I really like Halle Berry, and she has made some fine films, this isnt one of them. Add this to the wasted talents of Benjamin Bratt and Sharon Stone and you have a complete waste of time. Not that it hasnt been tried before. We all remember Catwoman from the ole Batman and Robin series with the luscious Julie Newmar, that worked ok. Scroll down a few years to Michelle Pfeifer, in agan Batman, ok, not bad. But somewhere between there and here something got terribly lost in translation. The dialogue is cheesy, the plot weak, the wardrobe needs a makeover. Sorry, but I just couldnt find anything good to say about this one."
3,Black Catwoman...Big deal,"I gave it three stars even though I've never seen it before, because I liked the idea of them using a black catwoman. Big deal if she's black she's a cat, ya'll acting like you've never seen a black cat before. Any way I'm gonna go see it tommorow."
1,Are you kidding me?,One of the worst movies ever made. I am embarassed for Halle Berry that she has to see herself in this one.
2,Who Cares???,"I'm a white 34 year old male and all I know is.... HALLE BERRY IN A RIPPED UP LEATHER OUTFIT.... yum. I dont care what color she is, and, most of the time she is over rated (with the exclusion of monsters ball) - be happy your getting to bitch about the ""color of catwomans skin"" instead of having to watch another Police Acadamy installment. its a freakin move people, get over it already. I for one would think a black superman would be kinda cool....but, then again, I'm not a hater of skin. :) have a nice day"
1,Crapwoman comes to DVD,"Pay no attention to Kids Review...he's a known troll on this site and he does'nt have an objective bone in his body.90% of Catwoman's action sequences were filmed with a STUNTMAN IN HALLIE'S COUSTUME, I hope you were'nt doing anything...playful as you drooled over ""Hallie"" when THAT happened.As for the film itself...for drooling Hallie Berry fans everywhere to enjoy...not to mention the shmuck popcorn fans who don't really care for quality in superhero movies, just the size of the special effects and the T&A;, your negative ratings of my opinion will reflect that quite admirably...and I will laugh.Let's hope the commentary on the DVD is the apology"
1,Horrible movie,Worst movie I have ever seen. Wouldn't waste my time to watch this out of curiosity. Unable to find anything about it that is positive. Viewer beware.
5,Great Movie,It was a great movie. Halle Berry is a great actress and really like her movies. Hope she makes more soon.
1,"Catwoman: The Bad, The Disasterous, and the Ugly","This movie is probably one of the worst of the year thus far. After seeing it, I just sat there staring off into space wondering what the director and editor were taking when they made this film. Halle Berry had a shot of starring in a decent adaption of Catwoman. However, the creative forces behind the film couldn't give the film a breath of life or freshness. Instead, we get the bare-bones of an okay story. The editing is horrible and there are so many times when continuity through character expression is shifty. I agree, they could of made a good Catwoman film and still disconnected it with the Batman franchise. However, instead we got a blur of just another hollywood flop. My advice to Halle: Get a new agent. My advice to Pitoff: Stick to directing commercials, because that's all you'll be remembered for at the end of the day."
2,comic book to movie screen movies stink,"My problem with the movie is she is made to be a hero and a woman with a guilty conscience. Catwoman is a VILLIAN (hello!) she would not write letters of apology or save another persons life. The irony of this movie was sharron stone played more of the roll of the real cat woman then Halle did. This is the dumbest conversion of comic to movie I've ever seen. Cat woman is evil you dorks!How to make this movie a success?Give it the R rating. Make her brutally rip people apart. Make her reign the city as the major leading for, then end the movie with batman ending her reign (not that I'm a batman fan)Oh and I gave it 2 stars instead of one because of the gothic aspects of it"
1,Catwoman? Not quite.,"I think this movie looks HORRIBLE. You can't have Catwoman without the full black leather body suit with white stitching(it just doesn't look right). I do realise that the original Catwoman was African-American, and that was she a prostitute(so Batman Returns while having the correct name and excellent suit, had the background slightly wrong). I don't see how a movie with a character from the Batman comics can 1) NOT be set in Gotham City, 2) not reference Batman, 3) have the wrong name for the lead character. Yes Halle Berry is hot, but I don't think she can carry this movie alone."
2,(sigh) The Director Hasn't Read The Comics,"Catwoman is well known as the famous deadly villian of Batman who isn't sure if she should be good or evil. Now this is extremely stupid. Halle will be critisized for life at this movie. I mean, the way she becomes Catwoman is even wrong! If you want to see the TRUE Catwoman, watch ""Batman Returns""."
5,hallie berry is queen of catwomen,this movie is great i loved it it had great action'fun'humor'love story'actors & actress'and it is exciting and sexy please don't lisen to the people who are so negitaive they can't tell from a good movie or a bad movie so are the critics.but lets not talk about the sensles people. i also bought bought my 2 buds a copy couple of day a go the saw and told me they loved it. please see it for your two eye.great movie:)
2,Catty Attempt at a Comic Book Movie!,"Sharon Stone (what was she thinking) co-stars as one of the employees that invents an anti-aging cream that has deadly side-effects.Halle Berry (what was she thinking) as Patience Phillips, the woman who stumbles onto the company's dark secret and is killed and dumped. Magic cats find her and breathe new life into her. And she pops out of unconsciousness like it's the most normal thing in the world.I was expecting camp but not to this corny degree. Nothing like the comics at all. The Catwoman in the comics is a cat burglar, who is the nemesis and sometimes-ally with Batman. The Sixties TV series with several campy Catwomen were so much more intelligent if aimed towards a kiddie audience.The martial arts are a bit weak -- the cat thing is overplayed. And the love interest is as bland as warm milk.Avoid.Better Halle Berry vehicles:Monster's Ball(Sexy)Perfect Stranger (Widescreen Edition)X-Men Trilogy (X-Men / X2: X-Men United / X-Men: The Last Stand) [Blu-ray]"
3,Bad script entertains,"Catwoman isn't a movie but more of a flashy music video that features raw special effects and is littered with cheesy dialogues with a lack of emotional core. Clearly this movie has deviated from the portrayal of the dark feline heroine to a lame exercise in waxing empowerment in women. Halle Berry is the lone bright spot in the movie, playing Catwoman with a sensual grace and giving us a convincing transformation from the silenced mousy designer Patience Philips to the heroine who battles an over-the-hill cosmetics mogul (Sharon Stone) out to destroy beauty. Seeing her prancing around in her tights and wielding the whip should be worth the ticket price for some. Catwoman clearly aspires to be a C-grade popcorn movie with high camp value. In this aspect, it succeeds - the bad script and exaggerated cat-fights really left me unexpectedly hysterical and even embarrassingly at times purring in delight."
2,Scandalous if i does says so myself...,"I preferred watchin this movie on full screen cos ya know i don't want to see that plunging cleavage in miss halle berry's provocative cat suit. I think she was demeanin' to all woman and cats in the world.I despise the part where she lifts 'er arm up and sniffs.What does that tell me? Did she not wear her trusty deo 'fore appearin on set? Now halle, no need to be embarassed. Ya didn't win a razzie for nothin but ya did deserve yer other rewards ya done got.Reason i give this move one more star extra is becuase of the graphics and CGI. Talk about modern!I'm a country man myself but i enjoys the occasional future inventions once in a while."
3,Cat - Lazy..........and a little toooooooooooooo fat...,"Catwoman is a O.K. movie.The storyline is unusual........but good enough for me.I loveeeeeeeeeeee Marvel movies such as ""Spider - Man 2"" and Elektra (haven't seen it.)The movie has lots of bad and I mean BAD......VARY BAD special effects.The movie is lazy, mazy, and dazy in one or to scenes.Sometimes the movie is a little FAT because of the BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD MUSIC.But still ENJOY this movie.I like this one.cAtWoMaNdon't regret it (r)MaRvEl ExPrEsS"
2,nah,"If you close your eyes through out the whole movie you can at least imagine it's good.Imagine Bill Cosby being played by Ted Danson. They are both great actors, but there is just something that doesn't work.Imagine Will Smith playing James West in Wild, Wild West and Jim Carrey as the Fresh Prince of Belair.Imagine Black guys playing White Chicks. Gawd make them stop please!Imagine making a good movie and placing the right actor/ actress for the right role. Well we can still dream, can't we?"
4,"""If it was Lassie she would bring the key...""","The film brings to the screen the story of the very well known comic book character. The movie sheds light on when, how and why, Patience Phillips was transformed into the ""Catwoman,"" though for those expecting the setting to be Gotham City they will be a little disappointed.Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Sharon Stone, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, allowing for an entertaining, action-packed adventure.On the negative side, Benjamin Bratt's character seems to be everywhere at the same time, which is highly unlikely even for a movie based on a comic.Moreover, it does lack that special something to put it over the top, like Spiderman for example.Aside from that, the concept, the setting, the special effects, the music, and the battle scenes are all pretty good. Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!"
1,Its a Miracle,"This is an unbelievably bad film, but, considering it was made by a mentally challenged person, it was a good effort."
2,what is this i dont even,"I had ample warning before I saw this movie that it was going to be bad. But as they say, curiosity killed the cat.. pun intended. At least it was just my friend's DVD, because if I had paid anything to see this, I would be really angry.I do not know what the heck was going on in the writing room when they came up with this or some of the plot points and details. When Catwoman saw the pictures of famous historical figures in the past, I was cheesed off to see a picture of Empress Dowager Cixi with cats, this is a historical inaccuracy as the Empress was a dog person. Please do not make up things about historical figures to 'add' to your 'movie'. Some of the other scenes, like the basketball one, were truly painful to watch.And the outfit - Good God, what the heck was that? Who came up with it? The 'Catwoman' costume worn by Michelle Pfeiffer in 'Batman Returns' was way better than this."
1,Has Nothing to do with DC Comics...,"Im a huge DC / Marvel Comics fan, and naturally after collecting each & every Marvel Comics Character Movie on High Def Blu-Ray, I had to go back and collect all the DC Comic Based movies as well right? I was so excited to have this movie on BR Disc, but to my disappointment the 1080p HD, really brings out the poor quality CGI used in the fight scenes, as well as all the cheezy acting and poor dialoge beetween Halle Berry & Benjamin Britt, this would have been better as a straight-to-video movie, cant believe it was even released in actual movie theaters back in 2004. Didnt even finish watching the full movie, just put it back on the shelf, next to Batman Begins/The Dark Knight,...thank GOD for Chris Nolan!"
2,The extras help this movie make sense.,"Once I watched the extra features on the disc, I changed my opinion about the flick; it went from horrible to mediocre.The extras explain that there are many cat-women, and this is just a story of another one. Seeing how Halle Berry trained for the part made me appreciate the performance. She really does behave like a cat, even though some of those scenes are really stupid. Lastly, the Producers nailed the movie they were trying to make.This is the problem with this movie; if you are going to make a movie called ""Catwoman"" using the DC license, then your movie must star Selina Kyle. Shame on DC for green-lighting this pic as a major motion picture. It might have worked if they had given the movie a different title, something like ""Tails of a Catwoman."" The bottom line, this catwoman story should have gone straight to dvd or tv."
3,Catwoman: Feline Freedom,"I must admit, I felt that there were some things in the movie that needed improvement, but I think that a lot of the people missed out on one of the film's main messages:When shy, clumsy Patience Price turned into Catwoman, she became fearless and strong. Nothing could hold her back, she was a new woman. She did what she wanted and went where she wanted. She was finally free.I think that we should all take that with us. Whenever we're feeling a bit clumsy or shy, we should remember Patience's transformation into Catwoman in hopes that that would empower us."
5,Exciting,"I thought catwoman was full of all the coolest, most impossible things that I wish I could do. I really enjoyed it."
3,"Meh, okay movie","Had this movie come out in the 80s or even early 90s it would have gotten good reviews. Unfortunately, it came out on the heels of a wave of phenonmenal comic book movies and in comparison just doesn't hold up.That is not to say this is a bad movie. It is okay. As far as acting goes, I believe Halle Berry did a phenonmenal job. The script is decent and the plot is fine.Unfortunately, the direction and special effects is where the movie falls apart. Feels like they watched Spiderman right before they decided to do the special effects. They should have watched the Dark Knight instead.Had this movie had better direction/directing, I think it could have been 4 stars instead of 3.amnightus"
1,Catwoman or Bugwoman?,"I must admit that the movie had a good plot and there's no doubt that Halle Berry looks good in the outfit. After that, it pretty much went downhill.I'm not knocking special effects in general, but there is a point where too much is too much. And the ones used to simulate her movement were just too much. Crawling all over the walls? Last time I checked, cats do not possess that particular ability. Her debut in the jewelry store was hilarious. We couldn't stop laughing ... and I don't think that's what the director had in mind.If you're looking for a film with a good looking woman in a skimpy costume or enjoy making fun of movies then you'll be happy with this. Otherwise I would recommend passing this one up."
1,I don't if hally Berry was in this movie it was still bad,"How could a movie that features Halle Berry in a skimmpy, tight leather outfit be watchable. Well cause it's Hally Berry and she's hot but that's not enough to make this movie be worth anything. She doesn't even become Catwoman until about 1/2 hour in the movie. This movie is slow too. Not worth renting, watching at the bigscreen, watching it on HBO cable, or downloading on DVD burner. Sharon Stone has become un-attractive especially in this movie."
2,What was Berry thinking?,"I'll cover the good points first. Halle Berry did a good job considering the material she had to work with. Why she chose this role, I am not sure. Maybe she knew she would look really good in leather. Pratt was okay considering it wasn't much of a role. He was basically a boy toy (or cat toy?) Stone had a horrible role so I'm will not comment on her acting in this movie. How can you act when you are suppose to have a stone face?The bad points are plentiful. The plot was unbelievable. The dialogue was horrendous. The CGI was unconvincing. The characters were silly. The mythology was laughable. At least Spiderman had a good message: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Catwoman's message seems to be: ""Don't stand in the way of an independent woman."" Morality is ambigious. Independance is key. Oprah and Martha would be proud."
3,Meow Mix,"""Catwoman"" was not nearly as bad as I thought it to be. Considering it won the worst film of the year award from various sources, one can only expect ""the worst"". The only thing that saves ""Catwoman"" from being a total loss is the ""camp"" value and the ""so bad it's good"" quality that made many a film famous including ""Showgirls"". Halle Barry has never been an A List actress so you can't really expect much from her, but she does know how to gage her characters to a degree where it's effective but not spectacular. Sharon Stone enters to add a strange chemistry with Miss Halle and oh NO!, that is when the movie gets really funky and oh so.... CAMPY!! (the word d'jour). A most meomrable line from the movie that gives this film it's campy kick goes something like ""It's OVER. No......It's over......TIME!!!!!!!. Yeah, you tell em girrl! Hey, it's better than Avant garde BS like ""Elecktra""."
1,worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i walked into the theatre hoping to see a cool superhero movie but when i saw it i was like OH MY GOD THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I HAD TO SHUT MY EYES THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EW!!!! IT WAS SO BAD I FELT LIKE WALKING OUT OF THE THEATRE BUT I DIDNT!! I HATE THIS MOVIE, EVERYBODy SUCKED SO BAD AND THE GUY WAS SO UGLY!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS MOVIE WITH MY LIFE!!!!!!! UGH!!!!!!! IT'S HORRIBLE!!!!1"
1,Comic hero out of the liter box,Everything about the movie was terrible.Bad actingLousy storychoppy and confusing action seensCatwoman crawls up walls like a lizardWas like taken from a batman character and put into its own world (have to say its for the best).Will be a very unpleasent experience if your not a fan of hip hopReally seemed like the basis of the movie was to show how sexy Halle Berry can beWas a total B movieReally should have stayed in the liter box
3,This Is An O.k. Movie.,"This Movie Is Kinda Good,And Kinda Bad.Because I Don`t Think They Should Have Picked Someone Like The Beautiful Halle Berry And Turn Her Into A Sexy,Feline Robber In This Movie!To Me,That Is NOT Halle Berry!Another Reason Is That I Don`t Think This Movie Has A Good Storyline At All.The O.k. Part About This Film Is That Is Has Great Acting And Has Some Funny Parts,And I Think They Designed The Costume For Catwoman Really Good And Cool!So,You May Want To See This Movie,And You May Not.I Is Just Kinda Good.Not As Good As Halle Berry Movies Like""X-Men"",""X-Men 2"",""Their Eyes Were Watching God"",And Movies Like Those."
2,Catwoman: Grade C,"Catwoman is a blend of comic book style set direction, music video atmosphere, and special effects. Halle Berry is not her usual self in a very bad way. Her acting was average, and I felt and in some parts of the movie I think she felt that she wasn't doing her best. The story was a little stupid, however it wasn't unstructured. The big mistake the screenwriters took was separating her from Selina Kyle, the villainous woman from the Batman films. The movie would've generated a bigger following had the film taken place in Gotham city. Sharon Stone also makes a comeback role reprising the evil murderous woman she plays so well. Another thing about the film is that Catwoman is saving the world from poisonous beauty products, which is not a relatable fear. This film in no means will make people cringe when they pass the makeup counter at a department store. All in all, this film was fun to watch but lacked in uniqueness and class."
1,Blu-ray? Really?,There are SO many more movies more deserving of a blu-ray upgrade than this one. Who MAKES these decisions?
2,Dreadful,"Poor acting, bad plot, bad special effects.Not even Halie Berry in a leather cat suit can save this one."
4,Better than what I thought it would be,Maybe I am being biased because I love Halle Berrys acting and of course her natural beauty. This is Catwomen. I don't know what people were expecting. I thought Halle played the innocent clumsy girl role very well in portraying Patience Phillips in the begining of the movie and then shifting over to the more sexy catwomen role after she was resurrected from death by the cats. I liked the basketball court scene when she plays B.Bratt one on one with all the kids screaming in the background. She really looks sexy in that scene. In my mind I think she is in the top 5 actresses out there today. The women does have acting ability. That is without question. Its all in what you like I guess but I did not think this movie was to awfully bad.
2,Unexpected,I was under the impression that this was a dozen non-repro blue pencils but I only received one. Pretty over-priced for the product considering most places sell the individual pencils for less than a buck. Disappointed with that part but they were good about shipping. I doubt I will order again
4,The Lead is a little hard but these are non-photo pencils.,"I got 12 as were advertised, no problem with that. The lead is a bit hard, but they are non-photo pencils so I expected that. I would purchase them again. Great for sketch books."
3,"Decent Pencils, nothing spectacular","I bought these pencils for roughing-in drawings. They erase excellently, but a little lighter than I was expecting given my previous experience with normal Prismacolors. I suppose that having such a hard lead and being so light is what makes them easy to erase. All in all I'm happy with them and would purchase them again."
2,one of the hardest pencils i've ever used,"i was excited to get these because i didn't like how waxy normal NP blue pencils were (which would clog my pen), but these things are like rocks. even if you make it as dark as you can, you can still barely see it. not real helpful if you want a loose sketch that you plan on tightening up later, because it's such a chore to look at while you're doing it. i'm gonna keep looking for a better compromise."
3,Gift,"I thought I was purchasing a hard bound book, but this arrived as a paperback. Most likely was my mistake in not reading the fine print."
5,The Wild Christmas Reindeer,Jan Brett never disappoints with her engaging stories and delightfully detailed illustrations! Glad to make this a part of my Christmas Library
5,Wild Christmas Reindeer,Wonderful artwork and nice story. I loved the story within the story in the borders. It made turning the page to see what was going on fun.
5,Fun read!,Our children have received hardcover Christmas books every year since they were born. Author Jan Brett is one of their favorites. Our Christmas shopping was late this year and we received the book in time for Christmas. Thank you.
2,boring,"The illustrations are lovely, but the story is boring and not fun to read aloud. My 5yr old was completely uninterested and asked that we not ever read it again. I would return it if I could."
2,The Flying Reindeer,...The Wild Christmas Reindeer is about Santa Claus asking a girl named Teeka to get his reindeers ready for Christmas Eve.Teeka has never done this before and Teeka wanted it to be perfect.Teeka gets the reindeers but they act crazy.The next day Teeka brushed their hare and trained them how to fly or tried to train them to fly.At the end Teeka realizes that she has been yelling at them. She tried to be nice and they flew. She gave them to Santa Claus. He flew off and thanked her for her help. This is a very nice book I hope you read it. It is good for beginners and has very nice pictures...
4,"Fluoride free alternative, the tooth is out there","If you want a great tasting, fluoride free toothpaste, which can be so hard to find in stores, this is a good one.This one has no artificial sweeteners, colors, or sugar.The fact that some toothpastes contain sugar is rarely mentioned but important, since sugar in toothpaste can of itself cause tooth decay.Using a fluoride toothpaste increases your fluoride intake when some is swallowed (almost unavoidable) and especially when children use it.In school I wrote a thesis called, ""The Effects of Fluorides on Living Enzyme Systems"".To sum up, I could not find a single enzyme system, plant or animal, which fluoride did not inhibit, or effectively poison; and that is scary."
2,Pocahontas young american princess,"not a good book. i disliked it. it was very unrealisitic and boring and sometimes the author used words that i have never heard before. for example, wok-kun-tah. good one mildred criss.but if you like retarted books go ahead and read it."
1,very disappointed w/Motorola,"This phone was an extreme disappointment. I had to return for another phone after trying to use it for 3 days. The volume is very quiet, even in maximum! The screen is very small and difficult to see in the day light. The bottom of the phone to charge plug is not smooth and has sharp edging. No wonder they had to give more rebate than the 1c cost for you to use it. It is not worth it."
1,Shipping sucks. Phone svc charge starts before activation.,"Haven't got the phone yet but the 1 star is for the shipping.Ordered 2 phones on Monday, the phone was not shipped ""within 24 hours"" cuz Amazon said I chose the ""FREE Super Saver Shipping"". Then Amazon used USPS and I did not get the phone until Tuesday the next week. That's more than a week from the date the order was made. T-Mobile starts charging the cell phone service from Wednesday when the phone left the warehouse. Ended up paying cell phone service when the phone is not even activated.The shipping experience sucks. Should never believe ""usually shipped within 24 hours"" if you choose free shipping. Be ready to pay extra $ for the days you haven't even received the phone."
2,below average quality,"Cheap plastic. Feel like the lifetime is so short.Easily scratchable.Average reception.No missed calls list.Finally, nothing seems *good/ok* in this phone."
4,Good Phone,"Hi, I'm from Chile, i bought this phone because of the price and i am very surprise. The phone has a very good quality camara, and very good sound. Mp3 sound very goodI have exelent signal, even when my service company doesn't.It has some design problems, but what else are you expecting for this price!!, very good cell phone!"
2,Sent phone back twice in one month period,"I have only had this phone for a little over 2 months and I have sent it back to be repaired twice already. The first time, the camera stopped working and I was no longer able to take any pictures or view pictures that I had taken. I received a replacement and within a week I had to return the replacement. The second phone would not turn on after a week. I had not dropped the phone and there was no abuse to it. I am now on my third phone Motorola C650. We'll see how long this one lasts.Other than the returns, I do enjoy the features and find it relatively easy to use. If I had not needed to send it back, I would give it 5 stars. It is very difficult to open the back cover. I need to use a screw driver. The reception is good at times. Sometimes I have people saying to me, ""you get reception in here"" and in other places I can't get a signal when everyone else is on their phone. One of those things I guess."
2,Problems that you must know before you buy(and get rebates!!,1.Screen is too dark(complaints from lots of users and i experienced first hand)2.Camera is ok(not great but good for starters)3.Menus and options are too many .But easy to locate and use some simple stuff like how do i change the ringer tone?4.Documentation is useless .google it to read more ..but you are wasting time.Not to worry about back cover issues (for first time) as it comes from Amazon separetly and you can install in 10sec.Yes if you want to open it for some reason use credit card approach.
2,the most frustrating phone I have ever owned,"I really dislike this phone. When I read other reviews saying it was hard to open (broken nails, boo hoo) I thought that was sour grapes. But it took a combination of my husband and I 25 minutes to open the phone, which we ended up doing with a key and scratching the hell out of it. So fine, I got it all set up. But it would not transer the info on my sim card, so I had to rekeyboard my address book. Then, after a few days use, the sim card got dislodged and I had to go through opening the phone yet again! The navagation is also tricky. I have very small hands and still find the buttons too close together. If you don't lock your phone or keep it in a special case the camera comes on all the time. I have spent so much time adjusting the settings so it is effecient. I have no idea what they were thinking, but next time I am going back to Nokia."
3,Very delicate,"I feel it is not worth it for the price.1. Once you place SIM card, foget about changing it again.2. Very delicate and speaker phone quality is not good.3. Mobile service starts charging when you order Phone on on-Line.My advice is .. See it and feel C650 at near stores before you place order"
2,Display is completely black on this phone,"I've just recieved this phone on 11/29. When the phone goes into standby mode the screen display is completely black. I can't read the date or time or anything. The phone appears as if it is off. When keyguard is on, even movement of the phone does not make the back light come on. There is no way to determine at first glance if you have missed calls or messages. Has anyone else experienced this problem with this phone?"
5,Work out tool,"If you work out hard on a regular bases, this is the best-works great during and after my Crossfit workouts and long runs."
2,Don't buy the new formula with stevia,"The new formula may help with recovery, but it's taste is terrible at best. Nothing like the previous formula. I purchased 4.5lb contaniner thinking it was the previous formula. I won't buy this product again unless they change the formula back."
4,Great product and taste great,I like drinking this product during my workouts. Keeps me going and it taste great! Great service! Product was received on time and as descibed.
4,forgotten classic,"Here is another terrific record by a much overlooked band. Despite the absence of ace guitar player Henry Vestine, Harvey Mandel,no slouch himself, steps in and does a wonderful job. Though his guitar sound is very different from Vestines,he fits in seamlessly with the band. In fact, I could not imagine anyone else on "" Lets stick together."" The rest of the band is in fine form and this record contains some of Alan Wilsons' last recordings, including the prophetic "" My time ain't long "". If you are the least bit interested in blues and late 60,s American blues, than this and most any early Canned Heat album should be in your collection."
3,A Slicker Sound,"I purchased this soon after it was released and found it disappointing at first compared to the previous Hallelujah! It grew on me some after many listens but I still prefer the grittier tone of Vestine compared to that of Mandel. Mandel has a smooth approach on this release with some effects as opposed to Vestine's hornet nest buzz tone and attack. Contrary to the previous reviewer, I much prefer this approach to the guitar. The rhythm section is lumbering as usual but quite together. This lacks the emotion of Hallelujah!, from Wilson's soulful harp fills to the rattlesnake guitar tone but it's still a good listen if you are a fan of late 60s psychedelic blues."
4,"yes, indeed, future blues ..","A long time ago, for sure, but this still remains a truly enjoyable record on the brink of rock ?, blues maybe ?, psychedelic so-and-so ? Once you heard it, you'll enjoy it !"
2,Not great,I don't mind giving 5 stars when it is deserved. I did on 2 other amazon products today. This is hard to operate. It is also obviously chineese origin or similar. The only reason I even give 2 stars is because it is very heavy duty.
5,"The stories are wonderful, the use of language masterful.","The stories are wonderful. The author has really done his homework. I am particularly impressed with his grasp of the history and background and his allegiance to the sense of the stories occurring HERE instead of ""anywhere."" The use of language is masterful, a consistent and sustained catalogue of ""purty good English."" But to have the characters THINK in this demi-monde of language is something I've never seen done."
1,"My fault, but still disgruntled","Made the mistake of not reading the review on this CD; saw the graphic and went nuts, ordering it right away. THE BEST CUTS ON THIS CD ARE *NOT* on this CD. Stuck with having to order the ""Getting to this"" CD, again clicking submit in my excitement.It pays NOT to order from Amazon until you READ THOROUGHLY. Can't change the order, kinda screwed.Mea maxima culpa. A better vendor would have offered a better option."
1,The Pig Has Been Butchered...,Sorry...I expected the original lineup when I purchased this CD.Now I'll have to go looking for all the songs that are missing...Buyer Beware!
2,Two of the best songs are not included on this cd,"The songs ""see my way"" and ""summer day"",which were on the original album, are not on this cd which to me are two of the greatest songs this band ever performed."
5,About Those Missing Tracks...,"The BGO CD follows the track layout of the original (4/69) British LP release. For the 8/69 US release three tracks were replaced by newer songs:""Sing Me A Song That I Know"" was replaced by ""Walk On The Water""""Up and Coming"" was replaced by ""See My Way""""Leave It With Me"" was replaced by ""Summer Day""I just found out today that all three ""missing"" US tracks were included on the 2nd Blodwyn Pig CD from BGO, ""Getting To This."" They're not listed on the cover, but they're on the disc. In two years of owning a copy I never noticed!Unfortunately, BGO dropped ""Meany Mornay"" from GTT and substituted ""To Rassman"" from the British release... so ""Meany"" is still missing, the only Pig track that is."
3,I was surprised to see this available on disc,I first heard this album in 1970 shortly after it's release. I loved it then and still do but I'm not certain that it is the same album. I'm quite sure that this album had See my Way on it as well and to see it now not present is a disappointment. I'm sure that that cut is available on another disc but if your expecttion is to hear it on this disc check out the track listings. Notwithstanding this was a great tight blues / rock band that in my opinion had a lot more music in it before it dissolved. This disc brings back memories of Savoy Brown's Raw sienna and jethro Tull's This Was. Thanks for the oppurtunity to hear this again!
1,thumbs down!,"This much needed CD version of the vinyl lp IS MISSING KEY SONGS like ""Walk On Water"" and ""Summers Day""! Buyers Beware!"
1,Ruined!,Michael Heltau's lack of voice in the role of Danilo virtually ruins an otherwise satisfactory recording.
5,afterhours jazz for da connisseur,I was impressed that Salsa legend percussionist Ray Barretto appears on here as well. This is my first Kenny Burrell CD that i purchased and i am impressed greatly by it.
5,Jazzy Blues or Bluesy Jazz? Who Cares?! Buy It!,"You'll never go back to silly, boring, 3-chord blues after hearing what Kenny Burrell can do. None of the songs here are really traditional blues at all, but there is a relaxed bluesy FEEL in these songs. Burrell has the most incredible guitar tone and his note placement is perfect. This music is both relaxed and low-key AND dramatic all at the same time. Listen to Soul Lament and then Midnight Blue and you'll feel it too. He's the best."
5,I wish I read this before,"After 5 years on the Planning Commission, I got hooked on land use policies and controls. This book has given me an authoritative overview that would have helped me in so many ways as a Planning Commissioner."
3,Only One Sided!,"When I hang streamers, I twist them as I hang them. But this streamer is only colored on one side - kind of cheesy."
1,the muddled analysis demonstrates nothing,"I'm an artificial intelligence person, and I bought this book to keep up-to-date with what popularizers are saying about my field. Now I wish I hadn't--it's too depressing. James Bailey got caught up in the promise of the wave of trendy data-driven learning algorithms like neural networks and genetic algorithms, and the purpose of the book is to gush about them. There's no attempt to place these methods in the broader context of artificial intelligence as a whole, and no recognition of their weaknesses. The book randomly names these methods the ""new intermaths"" and analyzes them historically as a radical breakthrough from the traditional sequential, numeric, data-poor human reasoning into the brave new world of parallel, non-numeric, data-rich silicon reckoning. He's partly right about that, but I think it's a coincidence; the book's argument is so muddled that it doesn't reach any convincing conclusion."
5,Outstanding!,"Bailey does an excellent job of combining computer theory with history, mathematics, economics and philosophy. I can only guess that the people who gave it a single star must have had difficulty with Bailey's style which, at times, requires a measure of diligence to locate the point."
4,Dogs Love Them,"My puppies love them and I am satisfied. However, you do have to give them the treat outside or in a safe confined area because they are heavily basted and can stain your furniture. My sofa was actually treated to withstand stains and easily wiped off so no problem for me."
1,"A good idea, but not a very good book.","I give credit to Dan Woog for undertaking such a project and writing this book. Unfortunately, good intentions don't make for good reading. The book misrepresents itself. It's strewn together in a haphazard fashion. Nothing ever gets tied together. The title is a bit misleading as well. I bet many people would see the title and cover (with a half-naked gay porn star in football jersey) and think it is a book about erotic encounters with athletes or something. Well it's not. I don't recommend this book to anyone. If I were Dan, and I'm not, I would partner with an expert writer and really do justice to this theme."
2,Truth can be stranger than fiction,"The book covers a series of sports, but does not make for interestyin, or intriguing reading. A little too mundane and in some chapters quite verbose."
1,"Flaccid, feel-good fluff.","I found this book a major disappointment. Based on the title and the cover I expected at least some slight erotic charge, but there's nothing even remotely titillating about this book. In fact, the author wants us to believe that gay athletes never get off on seeing their teammates naked. Uh-huh. What is the point of kowtowing to the prejudices of straight America in a book shamelessly marketed to horny gays?"
2,"The Cover Is Misleading, A Boring Book","I was expecting to read about how an athlete feels with other men around, some real stories about their first times with another guy or even something like sex in the locker room. DO NOT BUY this book if you expect to be entertained in any way! The book is a boring compilation of coming-out stories, I only read it on the metro, so that I don't get a hard-on... It is probably a good source of information about coming out as an athlete and if there is someone in the closet and plays sports at school or something - this may be a useful read. That's why I gave it 2 stars. Honestly - don't get that book if you expect something hot. I recommend Alex Buchman's A Night At the Barracks - now that's a hot read!"
1,Now Made in China (junk),"Stop, don't buy this if you expect the typical quality from Milwaukee. These are now made in China. Mine broke the handle off due to a faulty trigger switch. With the switch fully depressed the drill would start and stop on its own. It almost broke my wrist. Buyer beware...china....really?"
5,It is an excellent drill,This drill is fantastic in all aspects. It handles real good and perfect for drilling big holes.
5,review of reviewer,"To the gentleman who reviewed the 1680-21 and gave it 4 stars for simply arriving at the house and didn't test it;""gee that makes sense"" During installation of a waste line section (4"") the bi-metal bit jammed on low speed. I now understand why the manual devotes significant time to being careful. Two days and some Ben-Gay does wonders."

1,Bad reception & sound quality,"It has bad reception & sound quality in DC area on Tmobile. Java is slow as expected on Motorola Phones.Nothing has been improved since t721i as far as functionality goes. Except Speaker phone and BluetoothOverall: Not that good, had to return mine"
2,Functionally maladroit,"The only reason I got this phone is because it is a quad-band and I frequently travel oversees. That is one of the few redeemable qualities of this phone. The Bluetooth works good, but not great. Using a Bluetooth headset, once paired, is easy. The phone has a lot of neat extras.Now for the bad. The phonebook is aweful. It does not group all numbers under the same name, such as cell and home numbers. Each number requires a seperate entry. There is a little icon that distuingishes between cell and home. Very little. And since the phonebook is perhaps the most important thing on a phone, a bad one can ruin the phone.If you do not need all four bands, do not, I repeat, do not get this phone. Get an Ericsson. You'll be much happier with it."
2,whan they build it thay didnt think,"i have purches that phone 2 month ago after i got use to use the sony t610. the sony was keeping my wireless bluetooth wireless device connected just fine but the motorola like to drop the connection and is unreliable.whan the bluetooth is connected you dont have much choices for ringtones, it is eather loud or not loud -- thats the choices.from tine to time the connection to the bluetooth will be lost and i have to restart the phone.also the software is very confusing even for me that im very good with computers.it happent to me that whan i want to dial using voice dialing and i didnt say anything it will dial someone.talk time is very good.the camers takes nice pictures.i have purchase the v600 because of the features but next year whan my contract end i will look for another phone not from motorola."
1,Not a good phone,"In total I had to return my phone 5 times for 5 different reasons. Not a very good phone, but T-mobile was good about sending me a new one each time."
2,Same complaints about battery life and reliability,"What other reviewers have said about bad battery life and quality of this phone is true. I am now on my FOURTH V600 and I've been using this phone for 3 months now. Thank god for T-mobile support, they exchanged the phone every time and overnighted me a new one. With any other wireless carrier, owning this phone would be a total disaster."
2,Slick looking but unreliable,"I got this as a Christmas present and it was amazing out of the box, but as the months have passed, it has developed annoying personality quirks that make it unreliable. The operating system locks up frequently, forcing me to remove the battery and turn the phone back on. The outside display breaks up and has to be restored by turning the phone off then on. The Bluetooth connection to my wireless headset will mysteriously drop out. The button response is often slow. And the voice recognition for voice dialing isn't very good (I never use it).I have to say the camera is actually its best feature, taking very decent photos and the zoom works pretty well. All-in-all if it were stripped down and made more reliable, it would be an excellent phone."
2,"Bulky, bad reception, annoying features","This phone looks better on the screen than in hands. I am having tons of difficult with this phone working on Cingular network - in midtown Manhattan apartment building on 50th floor or in Chicago suburbs this phone loses signal and has bad reception. Obviously Motorola had a bad designer for this phone - it is impossible to turn off ringer without making a sound, hard to believe but true. It is also too bulky and heavy compared to new phones. Stay away from this phone."
2,Very poorly designed,"A lot of bugs and problems. I had my phone exchanged 2 times because it kept hanging up on all incomming calls. Come to find out, the case (all cases I have tried to date) make the flip out lid extend to the point of answering if not careful when unclipping from holster, so if your not careful, you will hang up on your call by mistake (now I carry the phone with no case in my pocket). The phone is bulky. The top LCD screen keeps on getting distorted, I have to turn the phone on and off. The phone buttons have a very, very slow responses time and I have dialed the same numbers over and over in a hurry. The buttons on side of the phone are too sensitive, you can by mistake set it on silent mode (this happens ALL THE TIME!). And the most annoying issue on top of all others is that even if you delete your voicemail, the phone still shows you have calls, so you have to delete them manually in the phone to clear the icon. Next phone will be a NO-FRILLS, cheap, SIMPLE phone!"
4,No Regrets!! 80/20 = PROS/CONS,"For under $100 Def worth it!!!Pros:1.Sleek sharp looks2.A+ Best internal screen on any phone I have seen3.Bluetooth4.Speakerphone5.Loud ringers6.Solid construction ""real metal shell""7.Cool event lights on front8.Cool PC interface allows transfer ringtones and pictures or wallpapers send SMS messages ""too bad you have to buy it""9.T-Mobile in Phoenix metro area works great!!!Cons:1.Camera resolution about the same as a Nokia 3650 ""expected"" 640x4802.Slow interface3.Reception is not as good as a GSM Nokia but not as bad as a SonyEricsson thats for sure4.Phone book has a different entry for each number and email address ""annoying""5.Could use a little more storage ""has 5MB""6.External screen is not color"
1,Overpriced...Would never recommend.,"I have had this phone for almost a month now and have been extremely dissappointed the performance. The phone does not pick up a good signal at all. With all other conditions the same my last two phones have had much better signals than this one. Motorola also has other phones, cheaper by the way, with better navigation, reception, and screen resolution. I would nto suggest buying this phone."
2,Known Issues Motorola V300 and V600 series,"I used to work for T-Mobile. If you have problems with the phone, call the service center *while* your phone is acting up. Call the 800 # from a different phone. The rep will ask you a bunch of questions. 9 times out of 10 you will get a replacement phone. If it fixes itself while you're on the phone,ask the rep to note the troubleshooting and stay on the line while they notate your account. If the phone acts up the same way again you have a track record and it will be easier to exchange your phone. With the V600 and V300 series, if it starts dropping calls just turn it off and back on again once every 24-36 hours. If you're burning thru batteries, call Motorola if you're past your 90 day window but within 12 months. Remember, if you're nice to the rep they're going to do everything they can to help you, especially if you're to the point."
3,"Heavy and kind of big, but lots of features","It's a solid phone, good sound, battery - but it's heavy and kind of big. I was used to a smaller phone and although I took a step up with features, I took one down with size,weight.Also, the phone book stinks. Instead of having one entry per name, and then selecting whether you want to call the person's mobile, home, or office number - there are seperate entries for each of those so it looks like this:dave (little icon shows home)dave (little icon shows mobile)dave (you get the idea)dave"
4,Nice phone,"I don't use m-mode since I have the internet at home, which works extremely well. Therefore my monthly cellular costs are very low. I bought this phone strictly for its appearance and the bluetooth headset. The motorola headset is awesome! I'm very happy with this phone. If you charge it every evening, you can use it, coupled with the headset, for HOURS on end during the day, but you must charge both the phone and headset each night. It's also great to have a flip phone that has a speaker option. Of course there are some drawbacks to this phone (battery life, slow interface), but all in all, I would not choose another phone over it. I also have bluetooth on my PC, which allows me to transfer data and pictures back and forth (without the internet intervention)."
3,NOT QUAD BAND,Very nice phone but it is Tri band not quad band. T-mobile has degraded this excellent phone by removing the 850 band from the T-mobile v600. The ATT and Cingular v600's are quad band. You can choose the bands you want on the menu of the phone. Why would T-mobile remove it so you can't use it? For roaming or future use delibrately removing a band from a quad band phone is not in the customer's interest.
4,Not all roses,"The official review says things like ""nothing's going to break off"" but that's not entirely true. My cover slips off in my pocket all of the time as I pull it out to answer a call. It has already gotten bent and no longer fits as well as it once did.Furthermore, my coverage hasn't been all that great. With a little investigation, it appears that other t-mobile phones receive a stronger signal with all other conditions being the same.Additionally, the phone isn't very responsive. Sometimes when I start to dial a number, there will be significant lag (1/2 to 1 second) before the number, and accompanying sounds, begin to appear.Finally, on the Mac, iSync doesn't work with this phone over Bluetooth. You either need an additional utility like ""OnSync"" or purchase the USB cable for the phone and then iSync is supposed to work."
4,Freedom,"B Shah - please refer to your manual - many of your complaints are because you do not know how to use all of your phone's capabilities.The phone is excellent!!! I have no plans on ever owning another non-bluetooth phone again. The wireless earbud makes life very easy. You can set ringers for different people in your address book. (MP3 ringers!!!) Picture-messaging is simple!!! If you go to a T-Mobile store, you can walk out with your V600 right then and you have 14 days to return or cancel service - if you buy from Amazon, that time is spent in back-order. You will get billed for time that you did not have your cell phone. And if you are doing a port request, be prepared to be without your phone and it's number for as long as it takes for you to get your phone.Ever hear the phrase - If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is???"
2,"Great feature, lousy software","I am on my third replacement v600 from T-Mobile and have now given up on it. Dropped calls galore. Bluetooth operation is intermittent. It constantly flags every call that I answer as a ""missed call."" Wallpapers from camera images are stuck at a ""zoom 75%"" size.Every one of the 3 phones had the dropped calls plus some combination of the other problems. I will say it's ruggedly built, but what good is that if the software is buggy?"
2,don't buy this by looks,the looks were great and it was from Motorola.....so i went and purchased it. but the main problem is that it drops calls after every 12 mins.everything else is fine with the phone.
1,Great when it works,"I'm VERY disappointed with this purchase! The screen on the front often distorts and stops working. The internal screen stops working all-together. Then, suddenly it begins to work again after a week. Then, it breaks again. I've had to switch back to my old phone.A friend of mine also has the V600, and is experiencing the exact problems I am having.I don't recommend this phone. Motorola really slipped up on this one!"
3,"Good phone, poor network","My overall experience with this phone is good. It support mp3, mp4, mid as ringtone formats. It also supports animations and videos, many graphic formats. So, you can have fun with it. However, the T-Mobile network is poor. Very often, there is no voice or data network. I often need to go outdoor to talk or to get my download. I also bought T-Zone service. But, T-Mobile customer service is friendly.Taking into account that their rate is low, especially their T-Zone ""all you can eat"" plan for $5. I download cool stuff free from this site:http://www.funformobile.com/I can get all my mails, ringtones and wallpapers with $5/month. Not bad at all."
1,This phone really sucks,I got 3 replacements of this phone and it still went bad. The screen dies and volume gets lower with time. Dropped calls are just too much. I am sure I must have lost a few friends when I had this phone.Tmobile service sucks. There is essentially no customer service. I am not going to T-mobile ever again.MOtorola has good phone but V600 is not one of them. My wife has V300 and it works good.
1,Terrible Phone,"Only had it for one night, phone did not start the second day. They gave me a new one! The second phone they gave me had problems charging the battery sometime it charged sometimes it did not. eventually the receiver stop working it did not receive or send calls. The company changed it again. thats 3 times too many for me!!"
3,Stylish But Far From Perfect,"I was excited to get this phone, it replaced my T721. It is in a beautiful case and plenty of features like the camara, bluetooth, etc.However, the phone is not very responsive. Also I sometimes have had trouble with the front display going crazy and just showing random junk, and sometimes the screen doesn't come on when I open it.So I called Motorola about it, if I want it looked at I need to send it to them and they will return it to me in (get this) 4-6 weeks. Which pretty much makes the warrenty useless for my purposes.So if you gotta have a nice looking phone this fits the bill but think twice if you are on your phone a lot."
1,Seriously Flawed Design,"This is my 4th cell phone and the last Motorola product I will ever buy. This rather expensive phone has lots of features that are difficult you use, flawed or useless. The thing I detest most about this phone are the left side buttons which are extremely sensitive to touch. When placing the phone in a pocket or holster, if you bump these buttons you will change your ring style usually to silent from vibe and ring, rendering the device an expensive brick. I ""upgraded"" to this phone and now experience frequent dropped calls and poor reception in areas where I used to have great service. Obviously Motorola didn't do its due diligence in human factors engineering or field testing of this horrible product"
2,Bad bluetooth okay phone,I run a OSX on a macintosh and would recommend anyone else doing that to stay away from this phone. It will not sych the way you want which generally ruins this phone for me.
2,Seriously lacking in important ways,"This phone has Bluetooth, a camera, and world compatibility, but misses out on everyday user-friendlyness. The phone ""operating system"" has major oversights and is horribly slow, often taking 1-2 seconds to respond to button presses. Moreover, the phone often displays erratic behavior, such as ""rebooting"" or hanging up on an incoming call upon opening. One glaring flaw is the recharging process. You would think that plugging a phone in for recharging would allow you to continue to make calls when the battery is dead. This is not the case; apparently the phone only draws power from its battery and cannot switch to wall current when plugged in. Thus the only solution is to recharge the phone before making the call. Don't be fooled by the features, and get a phone whose everyday use is more convenient."
1,Motorola problem phone,"I bought this model phone from ATT Wireless in May 2003and have had considerable trouble with the display failing.The first time it failed was withing their 30 day return/swappolicy and so the local store exchanged it.The next 2 times, I carried it to an authorized Motorolarepair station here in Nashville and the second time,the service technician told that Motorola was having a lot oftrouble with this model and it's display, but Motorola hadn't made a permanent repair solution available to them yet.I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
2,Try again,"I have never had luck with Motorola phones except for my Star Tacs from way back when. Poor reception, dropped calls, low volume, bad accessories, no date on outer screen, and screen problems are just a few of the problems I have had. I just cant understand why they cant make a phone that works and does everything. I would pay big for that."
3,Battery power not so good,Its a great phone but like most high tech phones it eats up the battery power a bit too much...
3,TMobile es no Bueno.,"I like the phone but, TMobile has no, that's NO (NO) reception. NONE. ZERO. Every single time I use my phone I lose the phone call. Every time!"
1,Stay away from T-mobile service,I tried to cancel my T-mobile service a month ago but I was told I need to pay $200 dollars unless I find someone to take over my resposibility. I was suggested to suspend my account so that I didn't need to pay the monthly charge until I find someone to take over my phone. I do and find someone to take over my responsibility. Now they charged me $50 for last month during suspension that I never used my service. I talk to the superior and they said that either you pay $50 now or do the cancellation and pay $200. Why different people in T-mobile tell you differnet story. Don't trust this company. They steal every penny from your pocket!!
1,don't believe amazon for mobile phones...,"I ordered a couple of V600 with T-Mobile service, from Amazon.com. This happened a couple of weeks ago. Amazon told me that the order would be delivered by 16th december.On 14th TMobile confirmed that the credit check is done and it is approved. Today is 21st and still Amazon says they haven't received approval from TMobile. TMobile again and again says they have sent the update to Amazon.Obviously no service provider takes two weeks to check the credit. So I am sure the bottleneck for my order is Amazon. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!!!Regarding V600 with TMobile service, some of my friends are using it and it is too good. I am eager to see my new V600 phone. But probably I will not be able to see them in 2004 :-( . I have ordered a few books, a laptop from amazon earlier and the service was prompt. But for mobile phones, don't believe them. It seems they don't keep track of their mobile phone inventory efficiently."
1,bad search,"I have 200-300 nums. phone has to have diff entry for each cell, office, home. and search only works for first letter than you scroll till your car crashes. I have 40 entries under s and need avg of 23-25 clicks to find a name even though I am a power user and use tricks like searching for t and going backard into. I had motorola v66 and I thought moto would have fixed their search problems by two generations later v600 and i still got the stupid 20 key scroll. never buy motorola phones unless you intend to be moron."
1,ordinary,"this phone has some very nice features, but they still are some of the most standard features w/the top of the line cell phones today. (bluetooth, camera, color, viseo, and mp3...) i used this phone not too long ago, and already had it sold to a friend.the design of this phone is what disapointed me. to me, it seems like moto just add some new features to an old phone (the phone looks not much different from the phones 3 years ago, or any other phones from other brands). that's why i might just pick a korean brand.well, i guess there are moto lovers who still just like this old design. but i am always looking for something more creative and cutting-edge. especially if i am going to spend money on it."
3,"Yeah, sure.","The V600 is a 3.5 out of 5 phone, IMO. Not the best but certainly not the worst. And T-Mobile beats everyone else in my experience. Perhaps the V600 is not good in England because their connectivity technology is a bit short. We notice that the Brits are really progressive. Thats why they depend on our Amazon.com, our EBAY and countless other needs they can't seem to get going for themselves. Ck the Prince of Wales and his new bride for a good example of Brit quality. Anyway, Thanks for your encouragement, Mr. Lime - and your politeness, you have confirmed our held views. Maybe consider some good Brit manners with your enlightening reviews next time. Cheers ! ! !"
2,V600 Is Pretty Mediocre,"I recently purchased the V600 Motorola phone and the Jabra BT250 Bluetooth headset through Cingular. The phone itself is quite cool. Cingular service in New Jersey and Texas, however, has been very spotty. The Jabra headset and/or V600 have not been worth the trouble. When the combination works, it's very nice. However, I frequently lose the pairing between the two and have to take the SIMM card out of the phone and re-charge the headset (basically re-booting both of them). The earpiece on the headset is pretty weak. I have to hold my finger on it to keep it in my ear so I can hear well. I might as well hold the phone to my ear."
2,replaced 4 times with cingular,"I have had the phone for about 7 months, I love many of the features, the colors, camera, blue tooth for my car and the size of the phone.But Ive had so many dropped calls and calls that don't go through, that they have replaced it 4 times -Now cingular will replace this phone for a motorola v551 and they are no longer carrying the phone because of this known problem. The case also scratches easily. hopefully the v551 will be better.Dropped calls are frequent!"
2,Dropped Calls,"Tech support is awful. i've had 20 dropped calls in the past month. i'll have four bars and in the middle of a conversation and the call would drop. I called Moto tech support located somewhere in india, and they said could do nothing. They told me to buy another $300 phone. i've talked with several other v600 owners and they've had the same problem. DON'T BUY NEW MOTOROLA PHONES."
4,Good phone but few problems,"CONSFont size is too small. I asked Motorola representative and they've told me that there is no ""Zoom"" feature for this phone.If anyone knows how to make the font size bigger, please tell me.PROSI like how it lights up when phone rings. If you have the phone on vibrate or silent you can see the lights.Good camera."
5,its excellent ...,i just got this phone yesterday and its awesome...the camera can zoom in up to 4x. and its pretty clear. and i can also play mp3 ringtones because it's a speakerphone. a lot of people are saying that the service isnt good or whatever but really...it depends on where you live..i get excellent service in my area..i didnt have ANY dropped calls or anything .
2,Display some times gets hung ( a white screen),I did't see the reviews before i got this phone. The first day it self the display got hung when my wife is trying to call me from the same shopping place. I had to remove and place the battery to get started. The same problem araised when the battery is down and the display is hung even when the phone is given charging. I had removed and placed the battery to get to see the screen. As one of the reviews say the software is also very slow.T-Mobile support asked me to do a master reset. But i am sure the problem is still there in this phone.This is a slow response phone!!!
3,Motorola v600 unlocked/t-mobile 1 star,"I bought this phone unlocked for $275 new from ebay. I did this so I would NOT have to sign a contract with anyone plus since it's a global phone it makes more sense that way. You can't hear the other person w/out a headset, talk about a HUGE setback. It's bluetooth does not work well with mac computers and the picture quality sucks big time. I'm really sorry I bought this piece of good looking junk. I now have the V330 and That is the best phone ever! And it's completely compatible with mac computers even though Motorola says it isn't. In fact Motorola itself is not a good source to get any information on their products. Does anyone know why this is????"
3,great for everything except listening,"The phone is truly incredible as everything but a phone. It is the best in every catagory EXCEPT the recption volume. The cost of accessories to get a link from laptop to internet via the V600 is also something to consider. It is very nice, though, as an on ramp to the www if you pay for the extras. Only problem is that the connection can be difficult to initiate at high speeds or out of town."
1,Motorola V600 Problems,"I purchased the Motorola V600 3 weeks ago and is not worth $20. Issues:1. The ""7"" and sometimes the ""6"" key. I would have to depress those keys multiple times before it would register.2. The phone would freeze when I was disconnecting from a call. The phone would not hang up and would have to depress the off button for 3-5 minutes before shutting down.3. The volume control is poor. On the highest setting the volume is still low compared to other phones.I just purchased the Motorola V505 and seems to work better however, when I receive an incoming call and answer the call, when I hang up from that call - I get the message missed call so all calls I answer after I hang up are coming up missed call."
3,very average phone -- u better have great ears,"Have had it about a month. Everything works as advertised excepting(a) even at max volume, I have difficulty hearing the other person. (With other phones, the max vol is way too high -- so I am not hard of hearing :) )(b) very slow interface"
1,"Their software is very bad. Difficult to use, expensive, full of errors and gives a lot of problems (a package costs over $100 a","Their software is very bad. Difficult to use, expensive, full of errors and gives a lot of problems (a package costs over $100 and it doesn't even work)."
3,"Enjoyable, but overated","Nicely presented book - too much text that says very little.Glossy, but lacking real content."
3,Lacking Diversity,"Guess what? Women of color, families of color also grew up on farms. Any people of color featured in the book? Um...no. Except one photo on page 42.I am a huge fan of the Little House series of books. But this book is regrettably homogenous. In this day and age, as opposed to the 1800s, there is really no excuse for that."
5,First book on my shelf and always within reach!,"I can get happily lost in this book. On a rainy day, on a cold winter day, and yes, even on a warm springtime day when I would otherwise be outside in the sun! I gave a copy to my best friend for Christmas. This book inspires me to 'try'. Not even just to 'try', but to actually 'do'. With no particular carpentry skills, I measured and drew and cut and put together the wooden lingerie dryer pictured in the book. Thanks, Mary Jane, for empowering this old 'still stuck in the city' farmgirl. What's next? I think I'd like to learn to sew....."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I just received this book from my book club, and am going to return it. The title caught my attention, since I grew up on a farm. I was very disappointed and put off by this book. Especially a turn off for me was the section on wilderness camping, where the author gives detailed instructions on how to pee without spattering on yourself (!) She also advises that during these camping trips to ""wash your crotch regularly""!! Sorry, I have enough common sense to know this! Besides, my idea of camping is our 30"" motor home! A very thick book with very little that interests me."
5,Oh YEAH!,"I honestly didn't know that Anne had continued her Pern saga until I found the book hidden amongst the new releases. The cover certainly leaves a great deal to be desired, but Anne keeps the reader moving with the revelations of the origins of many of the mysteries that have plagued the faithful to her stories. Any true fan must have and enjoy this book"
3,Aliens be warned,"Non-US buyers should be warned that this is a re-titled US issue of ""Red Star Rising - the Second Chronicles of Pern"" published by Bantam Press in UK, copyright 1996. The contents are identical.The difficulty in identifying this is partly due to the different copyright date but mainly because the Pern series is so interlinked now that it is almost impossible to disintangle the chronology.The story contains no surprises but is written with the usual McCaffrey facility. An easy read but one that brings little new to the Pern saga.Incidentally, the cover on the UK-Bantam book is far superior to the US cove"
4,Good but not without errors,This book was pretty good but there were a lot of noticeable (sp) typos in there. I think the story was pretty interesting and the characterization was really well done. Hope to see more on Pern from Ms. McCaffrey soon!
3,I love the Dragonriders of Pern.,"I am afraid I must agree with most of your other critics, in that you MUST get a new artist. I have never seen such an ugly dragon in all my years of reading. As for the content of the book, it wasn't as good as all of her other Pern books, but who cares? I wait impatiently for each new Pern novel and I would read anything she wrote explaining Pern. I eagerly await her next installment to the Pern series"
4,Interesting pre-history of Pern,"I enjoyed this book, for the simple fact that it did fill in some of ""lost"" reasons and existence of topics from the first Pern books. But I do not like the cover, it really does look like a flying pig (more like a fetal pig). I am curious why some reviewers act like Ms. McCaffrey has cheated them, since the characters are, to some degree, softer than they usually are. It's a book, it's enjoyable, so enjoy it"
3,What happened to the /old/ McCaffrey style?,"What happened to Anne's old style of writing, in which we closely follow one, or at most two, main characters as they explore their way through a series of hardships and discoveries? Since The Renegades of Pern, the books seem to loose that special ingredient that draws us in and allows us to sympathize with a certain character, and is replacesd with a broad overview of several main characters. DragonsEye is even more so, jumping around from character to character, never really resting on one long enough to truly understand him or her. Don't get me wrong, this IS a good piece of fiction, and as such I'd rate it about an 8. But as one who was spoilt on her earlier writings, I have to say I am a bit dissappointed. Other readers who prefer her earlier books might want to try Sing the Light by Louise Marley"
5,"Great book, lousy cover.","Just a word to the publishers of this book, the story is really great (as we have come to expect from Mrs.McCaffrey)but the cover is enough to drive any new reader of the dragonriders books miles away. Do something about it, hire a half-decent artist"
4,A very interesting book,"I thought Dragonseye was a superb book. A decendent of the first Fort wyerleaders (Sean and Sorka), K'vin has the dubious honor of being the Telgar Wyerleader at the start of the Second Pass. Also, a Lord Holder named Chalkin will not beleive that Thread will fall. This horrible Lord abuses his people (i.e. left to freeze, starve, high taxes)to no extent. I have no doubts this is where the dislike for Bitrans originated! It also follows the lives of a gifted painter and a green wyerling pair. It also shows the start of various traditions the Pernese take for granted. This book resembles the others of its elk, but it has its own spark to it. I strongly suggest this book to lovers of the Dragons of Pern!! :)"
4,great background for the series,"This book is great background material for Pern followers. In it you learn how the educational system of harpers began, among other things. I recommend this book to anyone who wants their collection to be complete."
4,McCaffrey pulls another one..,"Though the characters and the time reference are new, the same storyline as Dragonflight... unprepared for Thread after a long interval, the people and dragon riders of Pern try to battle the menace again. However, there are some interesting parts...and what we all expect and demand from McCaffrey...dragons!"
3,Fills in the gaps,All this book really did for me was explain some things that happened earlier in Pernese history. I could have used a character list to keep up with all the two dimensional characters. McCaffrey could have written a much juicier novel. I hope she beefs up her next Pern book.
2,Didn't read very far,"I did not finish this book, because I want to continue to enjoy the 6 good books in the Pern world. McCaffrey is not your average science fiction / fantasy writer, but she does make their mistakes. World building should be done quickly and then move on to characters and plot. I know a lot of hardcore Sci-fi readers will disagree with me, but the world/ tech/ magic is just a backdrop for a drama. Think about how many people disliked the 3 starwars prequels. Why did they dislike them, simply because they removed all the mystery from the original three movies. McCaffrey eventually does this with first fall and dragonseye. I will not finish this book, nor read the other book. There is no need to answer questions that would only cause the story to lose it's flavor. When you find out that cinnamon is the mystery ingredient in the chili, it never tastes as good."
4,A great dragon-book . . . but too much other stuff!,"Dragonseye (Red Star Rising in the UK) was a great book. I especially liked Zulaya, the senior queenrider at Telgar Weyr, and her dragon Meranath. But WHAT is with the homosexuality? Okay, we all know what blue and green riders are. No problem there. But the details it went into destroyed much of what the dragons ought to represent. Great book in other respects, wonderful characters, but a bit too graphic for my liking."
1,This book is not my kinda book . . . . .,"If, like myself, you pick up a book to read about two dimensional characters, romance and quality that Mills and Boon would be jealous of, a cover that looks like a two year-old drew it, adventure that would make my maths teacher fall asleep and one which you can't get into at all when your reading you would find that it's only the cover that will satisfy you. If your unlucky enough to live in the UK, you'll find that even that is taken away from you.I am sickened by this book- and if you take my advice cut off the cover and put it around a book whose author wrote the back of a cornflake packet. . . . and you'll be much more happier. When I read this book, I found it was _so_ boring."
2,Did the past history with Pern dissolve?,"Reading ""Dragonseye"" made me feel that Rod Sterling is alive and well and has taken up residence either in Pern or with McCaffrey. The book makes it sound like its era, 257 years after landing, is only the 2nd Fall to have ever occurred. What about the Oldtimers' and F'lar/Lessa's Fall? Didn't AIVAS eliminate Thread? How did all the Halls and Crafts fall into disuse? Where are/were the Harpers? If this is just an alternate universe/time line where Pern also might have gone, just say so. But this book is a total dis-connect. On a more literary level, I didn't find the characters or the plot as well developed as I'd anticipate from McCaffrey. None of the characters or group of characters were ones that were made very interesting. The ""plot"" seemed to be that one greedy, degenerative Lord Holder doesn't believe that Thread will reappear - VERY thin. Hope for better next time!!!"
2,Childish and immature,"Some writers have it. Anne McCaffrey doesn't. There are many, many storyline possibilities for this world's scenario and none of them are exploited correctly. McCaffrey's style is simplistic and childish (there are better ways to show what someone is thinking than writing, ""So-and-so thought this""). The characters are even more one-dimensional than those on Battlestar Galactica with none of the exciting effects. My advice, Mrs. McCaffrey: stick to children's books. Maybe you'll be better at that."
3,More like 3 and 1/2,"Well if you are stickly a Pern fan it would be a fine novel, and God knows this book is still much better then alot of the stuff getting published. Ms. McCaffey oversteps her bounds here I think, that is the main problem. Previously the books have delt with the later ""pases"" of the red star. This book was supposed to introduce us to the secound pass. I urge anyone thinking of starting a kinship with these books to reconsider and start at the begining. Then you will do better about understanding this serise of books."
3,The book was ok but saddened at some of the anti-gay comment,"Just a quick line to say that while I enjoyed this book, it wasn't up to Anns usual standard. However I am saddened by some of the anti-gay comments made by other reviews. I didn't take too much notice of the cover but looked again. It wasn't as good"
1,mathematically difficult/ a guide to adaptive fuzzy,"Mathematical difficulty will make you tired. But the idea to adjust the fuzzy parameters, i think, is helpful to study adaptive fuzzy control. Mathematical difficulty is due to stability analysis."
4,Standard,"Unger's work is still the standard on the subject. His systematic study is free from the author's personal opinions as he emphasizes that the Word of God is our standard for truth, especially on a subject such as Demonology where we cannot obtain facts empirically. In addition, Unger does not ignore non-biblical sources in this fascinating study."
1,Disappointed !,I am disappointed in this book in the way that it was written. It appeared to me that it was written from one college professor to another college professor. There is nothing wrong with that if that is what you are looking for but it was very boring and I would relate it to eating a peanut butter sandwich and not having anything available to drink. I had to look up numerous words on every page just to see what they meant. I would not recommend this book unless you have a vocabulary that is well verse in a language that the average person would not use in everyday life. I did not finish the book. I would recommend Kurt E. Koch books instead.
4,Great For Study,Great reference material for those who are on the front lines for Jesus Christ. Very organized text with many reference points.
1,Horrible,"WCW hasn't had a good PPV since ... I'ld say early 96' and this was one of the worst ones ever. I mean Jay Leno beating a nearly 20 year veteran and a black belt karate instructer,come on. 2nd of all your price for these videos is absurd, come on people 50 bucks you can almost buy 2 Live PPV's for that , I would buy like 5 at a time if the price was lower."
3,Disappointed,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AS I EXPECTED TO SEE PHOTOS OF THE LUNA MOTH AND MORE WRITTEN INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH INFORMATIVE AS TO WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS NOT THOROUGH ENOUGH AS TO ITS HISTORY OR BIOGRAPHY. MY LUNA MOTH WAS FOUND IN MY HOUSE IN FLORIDA, LONG WAY FROM MEXICO/CALIFORNIA HABITAT. I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THE PICTURES MORE OF A CARTOON MANNER.I AM KEEPING THE BOOK, BUT AS I SAY EXPECTED MORE. THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK WAS FOUND TO BE NEW AS TOLD."
5,Nice Celtic Earrings,"I really like these earrings, and have even received a compliment or 2 on them. They're not gaudy, or too small. The weight is about right - enough that you can tell they aren't cheaply made. The design is what attracted me to them initially because it's not quite the same as most Celtic knotwork. Also, the quality of sterling silver is very good."
3,Check your receptacle before you buy,"Be aware that this socket is about 3 times the depth of an ordinary socket. I was unable to install this because the metal receptacle in wall was not large enough to hold this plus the wires that run into it. The problem most likely varies depending on what type of receptacle was installed at the time of construction of your building. Building codes vary across the country and change over time. Before you purchase, remove the faceplate and existing socket and make sure it is deep enough with your existing wiring."
1,Does not follow the USB Power Delivery Specification,"A nice idea, and it looks great from the front, but then USB power outlet does NOT follow the USB Power Delivery Specification. Therefore, any modern USB powered device on the planet will NOT understand that this is an AC powered USB outlet. Therefore it will limit itself to 500ma of power consumption. Recharging will take much longer. If your device uses a significant amount of power, it may continue to slowly consume the battery rather than recharging."
4,"Be aware: It's NOT Tamper Reistant, NOT code compliant for new construction","If you plan to install this yourself, probably no problem. I bought one to show the electrician working on a house I have under construction. He and my builder both told me they cannot install it as it is not Tamper Resistant (TR), meaning the prongs are not protected against insertion of metal objects. There are other manufacturers (Pass & Seymour is one) who make these in various configurations and are TR code compliant.It's unfortunate this one is not TR, as it's the only one I found made in the USA instead of the ""People's"" Republic of China. That's important to me. Hopefully it is to you, too.It gets 4 stars for quality and USA construction. Make it TR and I'll be back with 5 stars."
4,Good option,"I thought this a little pricey for what it is, but it works well and provided convience.As others have commented it does fill a stand receptacle box, so a little planing in wiring goes a long way. My scenario was an end run, so it was probably as simple as could be, but I did have to trim the wiring to a best fit scenario rather than just using the wiring as is (which was in excess anyway.)Charges my wife's iPad fine. Haven't tried it with my PlayBook yet, but I'm sure it will suffice for that as well as the phones."
4,Smart product,"This is a smart product. If you have any smart devices at home or office, you are bound to need a USB connection which are available on your computers or your laptops. With this device, you can have a USB outlet next your your AC outlet throughout the whole house if you want. 1 drawback to this device is the price. Overall, I give this product 4 stars."
1,Don't work in Nexus 7,"Don't work in USB 3.0 devices. Dont't work in Nexus 7. In Product Specifications, Description, Details, Features, i don't see this information.Check your devices Before"
3,Useful but annoying to install,"Power and Functionality:Everything lined up well and it charges our iphone 4, iphone 4s, and iPad without a problem - provides enough power to charge the iPad while running it too.Installation:It took a couple of attempts to get to fit in a 22.5 cubic inch outlet box. Placement and angle of ground screw makes keeping everything connected difficult, and while there is a cutout path for the ground and neutral wire, there was no such routing available for the hot wire, making things more difficult than they needed to be.Quality:Quality of faceplate leaves a bit to be desired as well. The USB outlets don't stick out the same amount as the 120v plugs so there's a bit of bend in the faceplace when you insert any USB cables."
2,Dead after 12 months - twice,Purchase two of the items for plugs in the kitchen. Both died after @ 12 months of heavy (multi device daily charging) use. Looking elsewhere (other brands) for replacements.
1,Not worth it,Does not provide enough power to be recognized as AC power (tested on Galaxy 1 and 3). Lasted less than a year and the USB ports stopped supplying power. I like the concept so I will probably try Leviton product next time.
4,Well made - make sure you have a deep work box,"Worked well in the applications I required, except for 1. The outlet required a deep work box to fit the electronics and wires."
4,Almost perfect,"Concept is great. Execution is almost perfect, but I had two minor issues:1) The box is big. You won't be able to replace an old outlet with this. I had to put it on a different wall than I originally planned to. For smaller spaces, this one (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007NC5GI4/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01) is better.2) It won't charge a BlackBerry without a special non-data cable (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A8OMLQ/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00). The FastMac support people were able to diagnose the problem, but I think this is a flaw in the outlet, since I can plug in a standard USB cable into my other charging devices such as my generic USB car charger or any iphone wall adapter without a problem."
4,great accessory,This product helped us clean up and consolidate our USB devices. We used one in our bathroom and on the kitchen island.
4,A Piece of Cake!,"As others pointed out, this outlet will pretty much fill a single gang box. Since this requires a special faceplate, installing in a duplex+ box requires fabricating the appropriate faceplate.. sort of a pain in the @ss, but thank god for the dremel! 3 plates later, viola! No more transformers! Horray! My only wish is that they put a cut-out template to help installers make a plate with the cutouts in the precise spot. Other than that.. works great!"
5,"""One of the most insightful and compelling books I've read""","I was immediately captivated by Mr. Prager's clarityand insight pertaining to the issues that concern modernAmerica. His faith guides him and he makes no apologies forstanding tall against the American trend of abandoning one'sfaith. Refreshingly, he cuts the fat out of partisanrhetoric by using common sense ideals to back his politicalstatements. All the while, fairly commenting on themissteps of our modern political machines. His solutionsare not quick fixes, they are ground in natural laws. Hepossesses the incredible gift to speak the absolute truthand to proudly encourage others to act morally in a societywhere unwavering morals are not en vogue. Hats off to anauthor with the ability and interest to write a book sobeneficial to modern society."
4,Reflective and Honest,"Prager doesn't easily fit into a mold of conservative or liberal. He calls his own shots and makes his own decisions on a case by case basis and as a result has detractors and admirers on both sides of the aisle. There are some practical insights included in this philosophical book. For example, on page 41 he writes, ""Life consists of tradeoffs: When we do X, we can't do Y."" On reading, he says, ""Since the age of fourteen, I have had a love affair with books and learning, but this was always despite school."" He lists three limitations of television: it is superficial, programming is solely based on the bottom line, and there is a lack of serious people watching. Prager gives readers elements of issues covered by media that are not mentioned when those issues are discussed. Consequently, he brings greater depth to public agenda items."
3,Entertaining and Shocking,"Kyle Mills is about to become a well known author, if his next books are on the same level as this one. Mills speaks of the losing battle against drugs, and then creates a horrifying solution to this major problem. The moral implications and questions that the reader is faced are brilliant. This book is not as suspenseful as it is psychological. It is definately a book that one can not put down. Read this book!!! I just finished reading it about five minutes ago and I am waiting impatiently to buy his next."
4,Clancy-lite,"If you like Tom Clancy but wish he were a little bit less detailed and technical, Rising Phoenix is for you."
4,Mark Beamon is human.,Most characters are written as being erfect by Mark Deamon has is faults but gets the job done. Do not pass this one up.
2,Poor Start,"5 Stars for the author's homework and the story's plausibility. Subtract 1 star: The author writes the ""spoken"" language, making ""reading"" the book laborious. He needs to learn how to write for the ""reader."" Subtract another star: The story goes on and on. Out of boredom, I had to clos the book at page 425. Subtract the 3rd star for sub-plot after sub-plot. Another case of boredom."
3,Starts out interesting -- dwindles from there....,"Intrigued by the book jacket's description and praise from Mr. Clancy, I took a wild chance on this debut from an author with obvious literary talents, but with need of experience that only time and future novels will provide. Fascinating premise...had me hooked for the first 200 pages or so. Then, well, I started to lose interest mainly due to the lack of characterization of the main protaganist and his cohorts. I just didn't feel anything for anybody, except for that touch of contempt toward John Hobart. No real hero. Got bored. Put book down. Went back to the library. Rented ""Riptide"" by Preston/Child. Enjoying the hell out of it. Ahh, much more my style...."
4,Not far from the truth,"After reading ""Rising Phoenix"" I eagerly awaited ""Storming Heaven."" This could REALLY happen, much to the delight of the anti-drug movement, albeit to the confusion of those in charge. Kyle really gets it done, through a sincere protagonist, and supporting characters. Read it."
1,Wooden characters with stilted dialogue and a silly plot.,"I suppose it's still nice to know people in high places. Without good connections, this author's poorly crafted work would never have surfaced from the slush pile. I keep reading it because I hope the writing improves ... but it doesn't. His characters are truly boring . . . there is nothing about them that makes you identify with them. As I'm reading, I picture lifeless, zero-personality dolts who speak as though reading from a teleprompter. I cannot imagine how this book has gotten the rave reviews that it has. Sophomoric is too kind a word for the dialogue. I give up. The book is a painfully hard read."
4,Newbie,"This book is no longer available (at least in Canada), but all the rest of the books in the series are, so it was great to be able to purchase the first book from Amazon, to better understand the subsequent books. It's a great read!"
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.,"Tom Clancy was good. Stephen Coonts, Dale Brown, Larry Bond: acceptable. But now that we're down to Kyle Mills, it's definitely the bottom of the barrel.Not only is this book filled with annoying ""uh""s every third word, stupid product plugs, and characters so wooden and thin they can only be described as paper, it's also awash in the silly USA-Today politics of the nitwit near-left (lions and tigers and Right-wing conspiracies! Oh my!) The book is roughly on the same intellectual level as the movie ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"", only a lot less entertaining.If you want to hear nutty conspiracy theories about evil conservatives, see an Oliver Stone movie. If you want to read a well-crafted political thriller, read Clancy. If you've got a table with one short leg, buy this book. That's about all it's good for."
4,An excellent read for anyone,I found Rising Phoenix to be an excellent book all around. With a highly original premise I found I could simply not put this book down. The hero of the story Mark Beamon wasn't highly believable but the wit that the author demonstrates in Beamon more than made up for that fact. The invovlment of a former DEA agent John Hobart with a television avanglist seemed a bit of a stretch but it's okay. The story unravels well and the climax comes as a surprise (it came out of no where) and I thought that was great. All in all this book was an interesting and thought provoking a great read!
3,Entertaining read...,"A pretty entertaining read. While this book isn't spectacular, it still is a good read. The author takes a different spin on fighting the drug war that adds interest to this book. Unfortunately, the characters were average and didn't stand out for any reason in particular. While this doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the book, it would have been nice if stronger characters that more aptly fit the plot had been included. But you'll still find the book enjoyable, because the story moves along at a nice pace, and it is interesting to see the response to this fight against drugs."
4,"Entertaining, a keeper, a really fun read.","I very much enjoyed this book. Read it by the pool on vacation and hated to put it down.Mark Beamon is a maverick FBI agent (picture Dennis Franz) tired of all the crap and politics in Washington. So he accepts a demotion to the Houston office to get away from it all.He is, however, one of the top investigators in the FBI and when drug users start dropping dead by the thousands, Beamon is called in to investigate.The bad guy, John Hobart, is smart and does not (like in alot of books) make stupid mistakes. The cat and mouse between him and Beamon is fast paced and interesting.In other reviews, I noticed some people complaining about product endorsements and people saying ""Uh"" alot. Didn't bother me a bit, I never even really noticed. So don't let that put you off this book.I look forward to Mr. Mills next book.NOTE: If this is ever made into a movie I think Dennis Franz would be great as Mark Beamon."
2,Boring,I thought the synopsis sounded good that's why I bought the book.Thank goodness I bought it at a clearance sale as it was definitely not worth paying for.I think the author tried to cash in on Tom Clancy's name to sell the book.It's so boring I can't bring myself to finish reading it.I'm a great thriller fan but this is quite awful as the characters are not well developed.The hero isn't even very likable ...the author doesn't bring the characters to life like so many authors do.Don't waste your money on this book.
5,Very good quaity/price,"I do some knife forging as a hobby, and was looking for some brass to make a letter opener for my Dad(loves brass). This stuff was less expensive by far than anything else I could find!"
4,Just what I needed,"I needed to make a couple pairs of knife hinges for a TV cabinet I was building. I couldn't find any big enough so decided to make them myself. The cost seemed a little high, but what are you gonna do? It was convenient to get them from Amazon."
2,bowed and scuffed up,"Some of the old Small Parts inventory is in good shape, some has evidently been around for years. I bought a piece of 1/8"" x 2"" x 36"" 360 brass recently that had two problems: a significant bowing (about 3/16"" over the 36"" length) and the surface was pretty scuffed up (dings over .005"" deep), so I had to spend some extra time (aka $) cleaning it up to be usable.I wish Amazon and Amazon Supply would go through their inventory and put the old gnarly stuff in a separate part of the website so we would know if it is quality stock or not."
1,Super hole hawg,"This drill is to powerful for the internal gears. I'm a plumber and in 3 years I've gone though 2 drills already, both broke the same gears. This is supposed to be the biggest baddest right angle drill, but trust me when I tell you DO NOT waste your money. I have close to $600 invested and milwaukee will not do any thing for me. I sent the first one to get fixed and they wanted $250.$35 more and you get a new drill so that's what I did. Never again!!"
5,Simply Excellent,"This is a beautiful, thoughtful book written by a husband and wife team who offer an antidote to the prevailing mindset which has resulted in a high divorce rate and millions of broken promises. The Prathers impart some wisdom on the subject of enduring relationships based on their own experiences and those of the many couples they have counseled over the years.The authors take us through the different stages of a marriage and map out what to expect and how to deal with these changes. They present an excellent strategy for having arguments, and discuss how much people lose out on by choosing divorce. There is a good chapter on dealing with an affair. They end with the six promises of a real relationshipI felt that almost everything they have to say here rings true. This is a great roadmap for staying married forever and reaping the rewards of lifelong love and friendship. They inspire me to have a successful and ""real"" marriage.I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
2,Ok,i really didn't care for this book. i was part of a bible study group that used the book and it just didn't keep my interest.
4,Highly Recommend,"I thought this book might be cheesy from the title but have been blessed immensely by the raw honesty. I am reading it with 2 dear friends, and we discuss on a weekly basis. I would recommend this format. I am so thankful that the Lord has humbled my by showing that my initial reaction can often be very wrong. I would recommend this book."
5,Insightful,"I didn't expect to like this book, but picked it up for a book club and I'm so glad I did! Nothing in this work was trite, suggested overly simplistic answers or gave a sense of condemnation as can so often be the case in this genre. Ms. Rinehart offers sincere wisdom and encouragement, and it blessed my heart. It's the kind of book you can read and reread and get something new or with fresh depth each time. Highly recommended!"
2,Very Depressing,"I have no complaints on the author's style, grammar, or character development, but I found the subject matter dark and disturbing. It's says it's for young adults, but I would think that most young adults would not have common ground with the main character Jeff and his awful experiences, thus finding the book, not only unsettling, but unrelatable."
4,sensitive and realistic portrait of victims,"I agree with other readers that this is book is well worth the time to read, and will add that the authors sensitive and realistic view points should make this novel required reading material for highschools. My only disappointment was too many loose ends and unfinished story lines. I would hope that a sequel to this novel would address not so much the legal aspects of the story, but explore the continuing realtionships between family members as well as Jeff and his old friend Vinnie. The character of Vinnie should be given a larger voice. Using the Jeff's first person POV was extermely effective, but I would also like to experience other characters POV."
5,"Amazing... poignant, honest, and compelling.","When Jeff Comes Home is probably the best YA book I've read this year. It subtly discusses the sexual abuse and molestation of Jeff Hart, but mostly focuses on Jeff's self-loathing and denial when his captor for 2 and 1/2 years returns Jeff to his house. Feeling detached and lonely, Jeff keeps to himself and cannot seem to reconstruct the relationships of his past life. He refuses to talk with authorities, and recoils further when the newspapers begin to publish many awful, but true stories about Jeff, thus destroying his fragile social life. Jeff must come to terms with what happened, and try to move past it.I felt for Jeff throughout the entire novel, and was even brought to tears several times at the severe, emotionally raw honestly that Catherine Atkins exposes her readers to. When Jeff Comes Home is a strong, beautifully written novel I would recommend to anyone."
5,Wonderful book,"i have purchased several other books from amazon in order to learn polish in addition to the few that i have picked up on ebay. most of them have been helpful to an extent but NOTHING has come close to helping as much as this book. after reading the other person's review, i purchased this and everything that was mentioned was completely correct. you will learn a tremendous amount in a very short amount of time when studying this book. there are exercises that will test your knowledge and will benefit you greatly. 1000 people could purchase this book and have a money back refund and none would send it back. this book is invaluable. don't spend your money on 12 dollar books because you think it's a better value. just drop the 30 dollars and this is the only book you'll need."
3,"Ugly cover, decent book","Decent book. Never really followed through with using the book, but was most likely because I was living in Poland and had enough opportunities for learning all around me."
5,Prefect Anniversay Present,This book was for an anniversary present and he loved it! He never says much about things he wants but watching the show Elementary triged his intersts in reading the orginal Sherlock Holmes. It was the perfect anniversary present. Thank you!
5,"Expensive, but worth it.","This is the standard reference book for anyone buying, selling, or collecting first editions. You won't find $20 or $30 books in here, this is definitely a guide for the high end of the market, with a good section on identifying first editions."
4,helpful tool,Highly recommended for book collectors and dealers. Good tool for identifying editions and values. A little dated but best on market.
2,Beware voltage requirements,I bought this for my Nokia 6682 but the voltage is not compatible. Since the voltage was not listed I had no way of knowing it was important. Now I have to send this one back and find a dual voltage (1.8v-3.0v) RS-MMC. The phone does not recognize the chip at all.
1,Not for a Nokia Phone!,Hey I bought this for my Nokia N90 phone and it did not work. I advise anyone who will buy this first make sure with the product manufacturer that if it is compatible or not.
1,DO NOT BUY a new edition,"You DO NOT need to buy the current edition. My sixth edition worked just fine, and cost $75 less."
2,Flip Flops (Chanclas),"When I received my Columbia's, I was a little disappointed withthe overall fit. The front part of the sandal is really wide,and feels too bulky and big when I wear them. I prefer a more form fitting flip flop."
1,I want my money back,"I thought it was a beginner book, maybe the pics are but the code [is bad]. Doesn't explain any of the examples very well. Not a very good book."
1,nothing good to say,Wow!!! This book is really badly written. I was impressed by their ASP book as an introductory crash course and it worked because ASP is easy anyway. But C# and object oriented programming seem to be beyond the authors' understanding. Everything is referred to as a box. I have 6 years of OO programming and even I found it difficult to read and understand. It is Repetitive. Based on old beta .NET. Not organized. Topics mixed all over the place. Confusing. Repetitive. Some sentences just stop halfway through. The real world objects they compare to are a joke. The same facts are mentioned over and over again in the same confusing way. Jargon is used and facts are thrown in at random but with no explanations. I wish I had read other people's comments before I bought it. Did I mention it is repetitive?
3,OK C# learning book,"This book is based on the Beta release of C# and is is full of typos, errors, and misprints. The screen shots at the bottom of each page have been reduced to the point where they are hard to read. Since C# is a new programming language, it appears that the authors did not know C# as well as they should have or the publisher was in a hurry to get this book to market. When Visual Studio.Net was in the beta, a lot of companies tried to saturate the market with C#, Visual Basic, ASP, and ADO books. This book is not up to par with the usual Maran Graphics high quality. Your dollars would be be wisely spent elsewhere. I would recommend Robert Oberg's ""Introduction to C# using .Net"" instead. Hopefully the authors and publisher of this book are working on a ""Second edition"" to correct the issues. The idea of ""virtual blueprint"" is good but this book needs to be editted and the bugs removed."
2,Not too pleased...,"I own many of these so called Read Less-Learn More books. Most of them I have found to be excellent for getting up to speed quickly on the subject. This one on C# on the other hand is terrible. It is mostly concerned with how Visual Studio.net works and how to look up documentation. When it does talk about the language, terms and techniques are all over the map with no order that I could find. The pictures on the pages (VISUAL)are so small that you need a microscope to read them. Also how many pages are needed to show someone how to open a new project!!!I got some value from some sections like strings, but that was about the extent of it. There are better sharp books out there."
3,acceptible beginner,"this is book is very clearly laid out as with othervisual blueprint booksthere are however some interesting examples in thebook which do not work which makes it very fustrating.In addition, there is alot of repeated informationand too many pages wasted on how to look up fordocumentation.the book however does give the reader the abilityenough information to follow up with a more advanced bookas intended"
2,Video Production Handbook - Review,"Good book but the material is somewhat ""old"" - no longer cutting edge in my personal opinion. I would have purchased a different book given another choice."
5,Perfect addition to the Jet Bandsaw,The Carter-style roller bearings were very simple to install and adjust. I was able to go through the entire process in about 45 minutes (and that included cleaning the sawdust from the parts of the saw I haven't seen in years). Changing adjustments for different blades is also a snap.The saw now cuts perfectly. The saw stays on the line and cuts exactly where I want it to. Jet ought to make this device standard equipment for their bandsaws.
3,"Decent for the price, would have rather bought the Carter","Seem to work fine. The thumbscrew setup has the same ""have to use pliers"" setup as the stock set.Roller seem to be fine quality. Toolless adjustability would have been entirely worth the price difference to the Carters."
5,Just what I needed,"I recently purchased my first bandsaw (used). It had the plastic blade guides that had to be constantly adjusted.I had begun shopping for a replacement,when I got the E-mail notice about the Jet guides on sale from Amazon.Since I also had a twenty dollarar coupon, this was perfect for me. The guides work great, were easy to install.They made my saw 100% better. John Oelze"
3,Hm...,"I liked the 'arranged marriage' plot, and the historical details. But the romance was somehow lacking. I hate it when the heroes aren't able to talk to each other and clear their misunderstandings. But here she simply banishes him from her room. And he simply accepts it. And they want to be together, but won't say anything to each other. Why can't you just talk???"
2,"Too big, not nearly as good as the newer G15","I replaced this keyboard with the newer G15 (orange) and found it was much better all around. This G15 was so large that the mouse pad was scrunched in the corner, also had technical problems with it after some use- certain keys stopped working randomly. Not sure if it was a driver issue or something else (using Vista) but couldn't fix it. If looking for a great gaming keyboard, go with the newer G15 instead."
2,Disappointing at best,This item is for those playing a very limited amount of supported games. The G15 is not picked up by my XPS 700 series as a keyboard but as an accessory. At first it locked my system everytime I attempted to boot or reboot. Installation did not follow as per instruction. Where there were to be prompts there were to be prompts per the documentation that came with it. If I had to do it over again I would not have purchased this product. It is not condusive to the games I use nor to my use of my system. 2 stars
2,Nice keyboard but dark keys a dealbreaker,"Brought mine when it just came out so maybe they've tweaked it by now but the light letters on dark keys just dont work well during the day. They're light blue against black and the contrast just wasnt good enough. At night or in a dark room visibility is a lot better.The room where I keep my PC has a lot of natural light during the days, so I've since switched to the Saitek Eclipse keyboard (blue against silver keys) which I can comfortably use night and day. The Saitek doesnt have all the features of the logitech, so if Logitech comes out with a G15 with silver keys I would probably switch back."
5,The Kid Loves It !,I got this keyboard for my 16 year old Computer Tech Student/Gamer son and He Loves It! Says it's awesome. What more can I add?
3,It's Okay,"Got this gift for my husband to use as a gaming keyboard for World of Warcraft. The macros to use on the left side seem to be difficult to program. He wasn't as thrilled with it once he tried to program the keys and with the operating program Vista it causes start up problems. Keyboard is very flat, thus not good if wanting to prevent wrist pain. The LCD panel seems to work well and provide decent stats. When the keyboard buttons are lit, it is really cool. Overall, it is okay."
4,Nice Keyboard,"I bought this keyboard mainly because I game in the dark. Yes, all of the keys do light up in blue. No, the color does not appear to wear out. I have been pounding on it non-stop for about 3 months now and have had no wear related issues. Unfortunately the macro buttons don't always work like they should. I think it is a software related issue (hence only 4 stars). I don't care though, I just bought it because the keys light up."
5,Expanded use keyboard,I love the many uses provided by this keyboard from using it for game controls and even connecting other peripheral devices. The lighted keys are definitely a bonus.
3,Okay features but one problem,"Regarding the features:1) Although I have yet to use the G keys, they'll probably become quite useful later.2) The LCD screen is okay, but none of its functionality is something you absolutely need on the keyboard, as you can find software to do the same things.3) The USB ports are handy, but not necessary when you have a USB hub with more than 2 ports.4) The backlighting of the keys is nifty but not very useful unless you're a beginner typist, in which case you probably won't buy such an expensive keyboard to begin with.Annoying problem: From the moment I got mine, the left shift key sticks when I press it on its right half. It may just be an issue with my particular product but it is an annoying issue. I might get it replaced."
2,Keys wearing out,"I gave this to my partner for Christmas and she has been using it steadily since then. She is taking college courses online and does alot of typing. The ""E"" is gone, it just shows the blue light coming through. Even the space bar is wearing out. I have been using Logitech keyboards for years and every one I have owned has had the print on the keys worn off from moderate to heavy use. The RMA process with Logitech is cumbersom at best, so my next keyboard will be something else, like maybe an Optimus keyboard."
4,Want Quality? Buy This!,"This is my first backlit keyboard, and I am very impressed with it. With many programmable keys, very bright backlight keys with good tacticle feedback, and a multipurpose LCD which can show you time, email, media info ( what song , what volume, etc ), countdown timers, and more, right out of the box, this keyboard rocks. I mainly got it for the backlit keys and for displaying time on the LCD screen, but it has many more useful features.Right now I have it in my living room, connected to my home theater/gaming PC, but I am going to get one to put in my office, too. The extra features were worth giving up my wireless keyboard for, but if it had been wireless, it would have gotten a five."
3,Logitech G15,the keyboard is good quality. the backlight is week unless you are directly over the keys. In daylight the keys are hard to read.
5,Logitech G16 Gaming Keyboard,"My son loves the keyboard. He can't stop telling everyone in his clan that it's so cool. He also loves being able to play in the dark since the keys are backlighted. All in all, very worth the cost."
2,"Sadly, it does not withstand the test of time.","I purchased this keyboard well over a year ago and i'm already on my second one. The first was replaced by logitech because of ""faulty clearcoat"" on the paint, which came off within 1 month of acquiring this keyboard. The replacement came soon after and the keyboard paint seemed to last... for a time, however 6 months later the frequent keys (wasd to name 4) are already blue smudges, which occured under normal use. (This computer is used primarily for games, and I only have a couple hours to play them a day, at most )I've had keyboard that have lasted for years that still look new, however the same does not hold true for the logitech G15.Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty keyboard, with keys that are easy to press and quiet. The LCD looks sharp but is nearly useless."
5,Amazing,"I don't have any problems with this keyboard, it is simply amazing. The response and programming alone make it worth the buy. But the lighting and LCD are a sweet addition too. A must buy for gamers!"
2,Not very happy with this keyboard.,"The keyboard is good quality but, the blue backlight is very poor, at times it's very hard to see unless you are directly over the keys. The on-the-fly recording of macros is it's best feature. If I had kept the box I would return it for refund."
4,DOA,"These are really good keyboards...(when you get one without a problem)The one I recieved from amazon was dead on arrival. It would work shortly and then disconnect/reconnect on its own over and over resulting in a hardware error. So I give the one amazon shipped to me 1/5 stars.However there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel. I called up Logitech customer service and they told me to send it back to amazon. I then told them there was no chance in hell I was going to spend shipping to do that. So they let me keep my keyboard (which is broken but still an entire set of spare keys isnt too bad) and they sent me out a new one which works perfectly. So I give the product I recieved in the end a 5/5 star grade because quite frankly, this is the greatest keyboard I have ever owned."
1,Thank you for buying this keyboard. Here is your Italian Version...,"WTF? Why would I want an Italian version keyboard shipped to Newport Beach, CA? There is no where on this advertisement saying its selling an Italian version. BUYER BEWARE. I will update this review once I hear back from this company regarding returns."
2,Not my kind of keyboard,"I like the idea of a gaming keyboard, but this one just doesn't fit the bill. Regardless of intended function, a keyboard needs to ""feel"" properly - tactile feedback from key strokes is the primary criterion for rating a keyboard, in my opinion at least. I know this is subjective, but for me the keyboard just feels too mushy, and key presses are too long.As for features, the display is a novelty, as the games I've played showed only basic data that I could configure on my monitor, and I'd rather keep my eyes on the monitor than look down at my keyboard for that info.The extra row of keys on the left side were useful for several games, and the blue backlighting looks cool.I replaced the G15 with the Razer Tarantula, which feels much more crisp and precise to me."
1,Doesn't pass the test of time,"Great looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it. The keyboard self destructs after you have the, count them, 10s and 10s of screws.I called their customer support. They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra. So you save maybe $10 off street prices.All-in-all they are no longer the good company they were in the past. They need competition. So I'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement. Too bad they don't make those old keyboards anylonger."
1,G15 vs G15 2007 Version,Well this version is really not worth the price it is now i know people like this one mostly better to the newer one but there is mostly only 2 major diffrinces .G15 Old= blue LEDand more G keysG15 2007= Orange LEDand Fewer G keysthats the major reason why ppl are complaining about the newer one.the Newer one is better. but it would of been BETTER if it had a option to light up in 1-2 or more LED colors instead of one. will see that propbly in the newer logitech gameing keyboard
3,"Good, but needs some improvements","Good: The macro keys can be very handy for certain games and productivity software. Although the LCD screen offers limited value at the moment, I do find myself using it regularly as a clock, timer, CPU monitor and for Ventrillo.Needs Improvement: The key backlighting is rather dim even at it's max brightness. Also, portions of the key markings are obscured by the internal structure of the keys themselves, leaving some portions of the markings dim or completely unlit, at least from some angles (look at the NumLock key for example). The volume control dial is difficult to turn because it's so smooth.Other notes: Someone complained about the key matrix only working properly for the WASD keys, but I prefer the ESDF keys instead for controlling movement in games, and haven't seen any problems."
4,$$$,"A bit expensive....The LCD screen is a nice touch, but not enough games are compatible with it. The keys look great when lit up, really helps if you have to look at the keys in the dark.Although it is a very nice keyboard, it isn't worth the money. Go for a cheaper one until Logitech adds games that the LCD is compatible with...."
2,false advertising,"overall not a bad keyboard, but the only reason i chose this model over other gaming keyboards is b/c it's advertised that it ""shows you crucial information during game play"". however, it's not until AFTER i had trouble with this feature and looked on Logitech's help page that i found out that this only works for TWO GAMES and will only work for future ones if the developer goes out of their way to program the game to. What a waste, it's a decent keyboard, but definately wasn't worth price."
5,Great Gamer Keyboard,"Been using this model for years, and years. Finally I had to replace, I wore the other one out. Like the lighted keyboard, number pad, and the ability to program hot keys."
2,Don't believe the hype,"This is one of the worst gaming keyboards I have owned. The keys feel mushy on press, and sometimes even get stuck in the keywell, which itself feels deeper than other keyboards out there. When connected to via usb, the keyboard sometimes doesn't turn back on when coming out of sleep mode, I RMA'ed it to Logitech(who to be fair have great support) and the new one had the same issue (when no other keyboard had this problem.) Lastly, the thing is a behemoth, not only because of the extra marco keys on the left, but because of the poor layout of key placement, which sets everything far apart. If you are looking for a great gaming keyboard, go with the Tt eSports or the Razer Blackwidow, both of which are fantastic. Or better yet, go with a Filco or Das."
5,"Excellent Gamer Keyboard, Photoshop Keyboard, or Programming Keyboard","Excellent Gamer Keyboard, Photoshop Keyboard, or Programming Keyboard, Slighty less Handy for day to day. I have used a G-15 keyboard to the point the keys wore off after 5 years of constant use... So time to get a new one...As a gamer, I setup my macros and simple keystrokes and spells on the G-keys, they work just fine for both healing and DPS setups. The blue glow may not be bright on low setting but it is fine on high setting (and that is with 2 24"" displays creating light). The LCD is handy just in telling me CPU / Memory Usage, GPU Data for the Video Cards, The complete HUD for world of warcraft character info is a nice feature also.The winning part of the keyboard for me was the dual USB on the back of the keyboard with the advantage of the additional 18 G keys."
2,keys wear off,"A friend and I both bought this keyboard at the same time for gaming. Within 2 months the letters on mine started wearing off on the keys. Mine started wearing off first so we figured it was something I was doing until a few weeks later when his started wearing off also. I wouldn't recommend this keyboard for someone who types alot, unless you don't mind not being able to see what the keys are."
4,Good Gaming keyboard,"If you're a gamer, this is a nice one to have. You can create simple macros in game, or u can create them out of game with the number of milliseconds in between each key press. The only thing I can gripe a little about is a ""soft"" set of keys that require a lot of ""travel"" to press down, and the little ""feet"" in the back bottom of the keybord aren't long enough. If you've got bit fat fingers, this keyboard will do just fine, otherwise it takes a little getting used to."
5,The best keyboad ever,"Pros, awesome keyboard, the macros are great, the quick macro function works great, the LCD can even check and notify of you of email. I am not using this for gaming at all, i got it to create macros for other applications such as auto cad, it works fine there too.Cons, The tabs on the back of the keyboard to tilt it are not high enough. the, I will have to put something under it, to raise it a bit."
2,Not quite the end all and be all gaming keyboard,"Don't get me wrong it's nifty but it's far from perfect. Oops it only has usb 1.0 extra jacks. There's no reference for what the gaming keys have been assigned to do(little screens on each key like on another keyboard would have been nice). There's that switch to turn off the windows key, but why does a keyboard for gamers have a windows key in the first place. The result is that the Ctrl key is farther out than I'm use to (I've used an old IBM clicky keyboard for years).The included apps are barely useful, there are better mods out there but stuff like a task manager should have been a no-brainer. The screen should have been in color and higher resolution.If you have a working keyboard you can stick with that and wait a generation or two before getting this sort of keyboard. This is a vanity purchase at best."
3,can't operate,don't know how to use it. needs manual to show how to operate it by pitcures to. do you have such a manual.
4,"nice keyboard, but one problem","nice keyboard but has one major problem. it lays too flat. my friend bought one too and has the same complaint. even when you lift the risers in the back, it's still too flat. other then that, we love the backlit keys and the lcd screen that shows date, time, cpu and ram use.... the angle of my new dell was perfect. i hope they fix this easy to fix problem"
4,Great Keyboard,"It's a great keyboard, very easy to work with. A tad bit big, but you should know that, since it has 16 extra keys. Very easy to mod/take apart. Looks great with carbon fibre Film over the gray parts. Only thing I can knock is the black lighting color, but the G19 will be taking care of that (although it does require external power, not just USB power)."
5,Great keyboard period,"I got this keyboard back when it was around 60-70 dollars which was a steal. it was when teh new g15 came out and everyone thought that would be a complete replacement, i took one look at it and decided on getting an original. I have had it for about 6 months now and have had no problems ever. The applets for the led can take some major ram so i recommend shutting some of them off or having at least 2 gigs when using this while playing games. i use this and play games and run xfire and steam and ventrillo and some other stuff and use about 2.5- 3 gigs of ram. but i have 4 gigs so its no problem. One thing i would have liked though was that the usb would be 2.0 instead of the 1.1 that is on there. but not everything is that perfect right."
3,Keyboard Letters a problem,"I've had this keyboard for about a month, and the letters on the keyboard are starting to blur. The ""e"" key is barely legible, and other keys are showing problems. I wrote to product support about this, so I'll see what they have to say about the problem. At the moment though, I have to not give it the 5 stars I was going to give it when I first got the keyboard."
4,if you like the first one...,"You'll more than likely enjoy this too.To me they are very similar,I am not old enough to remember which songs belong on which lp.All I know is that I heard great things about this band so I got their cds and I'm glad I did.The jazz styles they incorporate don't bother me that much.At least they didn't show off alot like other bands of the period did."
2,Mick Abrahams Version Of Tull,"After original Jethro Tull guitarist Mick Abrahams left Jethro Tull following their debut LP, he formed Blodwyn Pig which seems almost like his answer to Tull. BP also features a flute guy, Jack Lancaster who doubles on sax. Music is a typical mediocre bluesey/jazzy prog mish mosh of this area that doesn't leave much of an impression(file with mid to late period Family) in comparisson to the heavyweights of the day (Crimson,Tull,Yes,Gentle Giant,etc.)I understand that their 1st album ""A Head Rings Out"" is supposed to be superior, but I've never actually heard it.One reviewer calls this ""American jazz ?"". They were a British group."
5,Pernox review,"This is an excellent skin cleanser, especially for oily skin. Not just the face but chest and back too."
5,Skin cleanser,"A great product for those with oily skin. Leaves skin very clean, with a slight lemon scent. May be too harsh for those with sensitive skin."
4,A hidden gem from the UK early 90's,"If you see this pick it up, it'll be a well spent few dollars. It is a true shame this band lasted only a couple of albums, as their music more than stands the test of time. A bit like James, but just more fun. Clever lyrics and a good sense of tunefulness make this album a pleasure to listen to."
5,"So, so good. Regnecies at their best.","My college roommate introduced me to Goergette Heyer in the last semester of my senior year. . .and somehow I managed to graduate anyway. That was 30 years ago and I collected all her Regencies in paperback and reread them all every few years. Cotillion is my favorite of many favorites. I still remember when I got to the point I was rooting for Freddy. . .and feeling guilty about it becasue he was NOT the proper hero of a Regency book. Georgette is great. Now I have a fourteen year old daughter to whom I am introducing these most witty and well written of books. . . and I find my collection is musty smelling and the bindings decaying. So, so I can share them with my granddaughters (the ones I hope to have years from now), I will be building my collection of Georgettes in hardback as I can. . .Thank you, Amazon.com., for making that a possiblity for me."
2,boring stupid book,Reviews looked good and I like a brainless romance novel. This one was a little stupid in the story line. Disappointed- never could make myself finish it.
3,Charged for a Free E-book,"I subscribed to Freebies4Mom and the site said this was a free download for kindle, however I was charged for it....Wanting to know how to contact either party because every email I send comes back. Guess not all books are free for kindle as they state. Disappointed!!!!!! The book looks interesting! Buster"
2,Disappointing production,"These Casablanca/Sourcebooks editions of Georgette Heyer's works are a major disappointment to one who has collected Heyer for years. They're a nice big size, have terrific artwork on the covers, and there is a very small number of typos, for which I am grateful. However, the paper used is of such terrible quality that I expect to have to replace the books within a few years. It is unpleasant to touch, as well. The cover art is identified nowhere, which strikes me as impolite at best. Of course, none of the art is actual Regency work; it appears to be Victorian (or later) impressions of the Regency, so maybe the publisher didn't want the readers to know where it came from! I am replacing as few of my Heyers as possible with these editions."
2,Serious Kindle formatting errors,"KINDLE REVIEWI first read these books from my mother's library (and many of them were from my grandmother) and always loved them for the lively historical romps they are. I looked forward to reading these on my Kindle, but the 4 books I purchased all have serious errors, rendering them almost unreadable.Dialog runs together without spacing, making it almost impossible to tell who is speaking, paragraphs run together (and given Heyer's frequent use of paragraphs which are more than a page long anyway, that's painful) and in sections the page formatting (no matter what the type size) consists of a full line of text followed by a single hanging word.I probably won't return the books because of my love of the contents, but I'm very disappointed in Amazon and the publisher, and will check samples of future releases before I pay for them."
3,"Book is great, Kindle edition formatting is awful","Cotillion is a great romantic farce, with lots of witty banter & historical accuracy. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition has messed up the line breaks so badly that it's hard to tell which character is speaking. Since Heyer's books all rely heavily on dialogue, this makes it hard to read the book. I knew what was happening since I'd read a physical edition before the Kindle edition, but for someone reading for the first time it's probably better to get a physical book."
3,Romance?,"This is a good book, don't get me wrong. But I was expecting a romance novel and to me it really isn't.... not much romance in it except for maybe the last 3 sentences. It is a long twisted story of at least 3 couples. Although it proved interesting it also bored me in parts ( I even had to skip). It's not bad but if your looking for a fun romantic book this is probably not it. If you are looking for a very charged plot book not much romance but fun characters this is your book."
2,Couldn't finish...,"I was excited to read this book after reading all of the positive reviews. However, I couldn't even get half way through it. I didn't captivate my attention(in fact I found it rather boring), and I had no desire to continue reading it."
3,"Quirky, fun, great ending","Freebie book, interesting verbage, a bit too wordy at times. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it by the time I got to the end. Not a fan of Regency romances, but this was quirky and fun."
3,Not as Good,"I LOVE Georgette Heyer and have read her historical romances over and over, including Cotillion. However, for me, this book ranks at the bottom of the list of historical romances Georgette Heyer has written. She has others far better. If this is your first time reading a book by her, don't stop with this one."
4,Charming!,"Kitty Charing has just been told by her ward that she will inherit his fortune if she concedes to marry one of his nephews. However, the nephew that Kitty wants to marry does not show up at his uncle's house on the day of the announcement. Kitty would prefer to marry Jack Westruther, the nephew who does not make an appearance.Kitty and Freddy, another nephew, decide to have a sham engagement so that Kitty might entice Jack to offer for her and also so that she might go to London and decide her own future. What follows is a delightful and humorous story of Kitty's attempts to help others in their own love lifes while trying to decide how to manage her own!This book has some truly funny moments with Freddy and Dolph the other hapless nephew who definitely does not want to marry Kitty. All in all a great and funny read."
2,Little boring,I did finish this book but only because was sick and in bed. It does not have any real storyline. I do like to read historical books but I am not a big fan of romance. This was more meddling a bickering than I can usualy bear. I would definitely not recommend this book to any of my friends. Deleted from my kindle.
5,Brenda Still Shines,"As you can see from my header, Brenda is the one I feel shines in this trio of authors. Before you start reading the book, this reader suggests that you plug in a fan. Girlfriend, as usual, is smokin! No one can put a twist on romance writing like Ms. Jackson. The budding romance between Trask and Felicia turned into a smokin inferno and if you don't have a fan on hand you will certainly burn! . Notwithstanding romance, Ms. Jackson tugs at your heartstrings with the relationship she builds with the entrance of Felicia's son and his wish for Christmas; thus you should also have a handkerchief ready with that fan. If you're looking for romance, Ms. Jackson is the diva of that subject.The story by Felicia (another of my favorite authors) was cute. I can't give any kudos at all for Ms. Walker. I didn't like the writing style."
4,Pen awesome but stylus not working with touch screen items,Love the pen but stylus not working with touch screen equipment so spent more than I needed too - recommend only purchasing the pen with clip.
5,perfect replacement,this item was just what I was looking for. I am restoring an old steamer trunk and the leather handles had turned to dust and needed to be replaced. This was a perfect replacement.
4,Great Reference,This booklet was a great reference booklet for meI looked to it regularly when I first started to help remind me of what to do.Having a little booklet like this was great when I was nervous.
1,Don't waste your money,"First, think about the fact that there are tips on the web about how to ""fix"" this attachment. That should be your first clue.Faults:1. It's plastic, and not a rigid plastic either. You need rigidity to cut decent circles.2. It slips. The plastic is very smooth allowing the guide to change diameters no matter how much you tighten the knob. Most ""fixes"" deal with this issue.3. Poorly designed ""peg"". Rotozip videos tell you to Make a hole for the pivot peg. What the don't tell you is the size of the pivot peg is bigger than any of their standard bits! So you either have to try and round out the hole with the RZ to get the peg to fit (good luck), or you need to use a drill to make the hole the correct diameter.Pro's:None I can think of.Basically, this attachment is a piece of junk."
2,Won't hold a setting and cut a clean circle,"I used the circle cutter to cut a few ragged 10 1/2 inch holes in 1/4 inch plywood. Despite tightening the bolt to the point I was afraid it would break, the guide still slipped a little and made ragged holes. I'm pretty skilled with power tools / guides etc. but couldn't get this one to work well. Feed rate was critical for a clean consistent cut. Too much pressure and the plastic arms flex which makes for a crooked cut. Cord was constantly tangling with guide. When bits ran slightly crooked they bound up and broke. Pivot point kept trying to rise up out of the guide hole. Too many things to watch and hold onto to make the thing work. I'm returning this one and looking for a simpler solution."
1,I should have read these reviews first,I needed to cut a circle for to make a jig. Code for stairs requires that a 6 in. sphere cannot pass under the deck rail in the stair step. I wanted a 5 7/8 circle cut from plywood.The product kept slipping the dimension. I have strong hands and tightened it to the point I thought it might break. I am so frustrated with this toy. I don't mind paying double for a product that works. It may work on drywall since there isn't as much resistance as wood.I really wish I would have checked the reviews first before expecting it would cut an accurate circle.
4,I had no trouble,"I'm not sure if other people have gotten bad tools or what, because i've had great luck with my circle cutter! it flys through drywall, and i use it to cut out circles in 3/8"" plywood for my daughter's room. I had no problems with it at all!"
1,Save your money!!,I purchased item at my local Lowe's. Needed to cut a couple of holes in drywall. After two unsuccessful tries I had two spiral cuts in my drywall (the circle tool slips as you work around the circle - giving you a nice spiral)!This thing is awful. Especially considering the price. I returned it and got my money back.I could have done a better job with a pencil and keyhole saw.
2,Not worth it,The connection between the Rotozip head and the circle cutter is very sloppy. Impossible to make a precision cut in any material other than drywall. I can do better with a sabre-saw with much less risk of injury.
1,Great Spiral Cutter,Due to the slippage I was left with a spiral cut for an overhead can light. I had to use other methods to create a trim ring to cover up the cut made from this useless attachment. I would try the sandpaper friction ring theory but I already threw this thing in the trash. I don't need anymore screwed up circle cuts.
5,Convenient and simple!,"I love these creamers! It is so convenient to keep these in the fridge (not necessary but I do) and just take out what you need. The price is the best here on Amazon, I first purchased these from another site and paid $2.00 more! I'll be back for more."
4,Apposite psychological insights into esoteric tradition,"If you belong to a westernised culture, steeped in theistic religion and didactic reasoning, AND know somthing of Zen already, this may be the book that finally reassures your reasonable self that your purely spiritual one is on the right track. Brazier provides a revealing and insightful interpretation of Zen practice through the mind of a psychologist who obviously cares a lot about the people he treats. If you are new to Zen or Bhuddist thought, here you will find the essence of those somtimes arcane ideas presented with new clarity, within the framework of commonsense psychologese we in the west are at ease with. ""Yes, of course!"" I kept hearing myself say, as another pearl fell into place. Still, as we who meditate know, these are all merely words."
2,Boring,"I found this book to be boring. It is more of a description of psychotherapy from a meditation point of view. The second part of the book has some good things, but for me the majority of the book is boring. I prefer the book of his wife call Buddhist Psychology or the book of Mark Epstein, thoughts without a thinker"
4,Great full-body workout,"I started using this product during my recovery from back surgery. I wasn't allowed to do high impact exercises, so this was a nice start. When you start the video, it seems like you're just moving from side to side and not much more, but after a few minutes, you realize this is another Mindy butt-kicking workout. The best part is that it gives you the chance to do three workouts separately, or you can push yourself to the full hour and a half. No matter your level of fitness, it works wonders since it shows you options to do the exercises at a lower intensity. Highly recommend it for anyone who doesn't have time to go the gym, but still wants to stay in shape and LOOK GOOD!!"
4,GE 3-way Reveal light bulb,"I read and the hardware salesman told me that these will soon, not be available, Since the CFL bulbs will replace the standard light bulbs. I have found the GE bulbs to be superior to the other brands, found them on Amazon.con."
3,"Great light, only wish it lasted longer",I would definitely give this bulb 5 stars based on light quality but they don't last as long as I would like. I have go through maybe 1 year in a lamp that I don't use very often. I find that the light is great for reading or working on projects but any vibration kills these bulbs. I like the 150 watt variety as it gives a better range of brightness settings. Although I only gave it three stars this is the only bulb I would use for my lamp.
1,Not the quality I expected,"I was pretty disappointed with these bulbs. Out of the 4 bulbs that I ordered, the first 3 burned out immediately when installed in the lamp. The last bulb lasted 2 weeks after installing it - and then burned out. (The metal base even came off when I tried to remove it from the lamp!) Pretty surprising from this manufacturer who is generally known for quality merchandise. Don't know if these were seconds, rejects or just inferior merchandise. Won't buy again."
3,Ok for the Price,I was expecting a decent size stone but instead if you have an extra piercing any where on your body...this is the stone size perfect for this...the price was really too good to pass up regardless of the size of the stone. But nice looking and it will be used for my upper ear pierced area as a back up earring.
4,Let this be your soundtrack this Summer,"I've docked a star simply because there was room for more on this album, and I feel the best is yet to come from this band.This is a great collection of songs, with hooks and a smorsgasbord of terrific guitar and keyboard textures. Tracks 1-3 are quite simply a short course on delivery of pitch- perfect 'heavy pop'. I agree that these songs need to be heard with the volume up....atmospherics need to breathe, so crank it ...first thing in the morning, on the road....anytime! Yes...see the band live, and then believe what a monster song 'Daddy's in the Doldrums' is."
5,"Unique, brilliant album","Should be a surprise album of the year. Moody, psychedelic power chords and strong vocals create one of the most melodic, atmospheric albums out there this year.This New York band out of Texas sounds a lot like Texan Steve Wynn and Dream Syndicate at times with beat-heavy, guitar-layers and vocals, and there is nothing wrong with that.Interesting music through every cut and the only thing I wanted was more music."
5,"Hated it on first listen. Tried again later and thought, ""what the hell was I thinking?""","I discovered this band completely by accident one day when they were on some satellite radio station my friend had on. I wrote the name on a scrap of paper and forgot about it. Found it later and ordered Now Here is Nowhere, which was f'ing awesome.I ordered Ten Silver Drops and listened to it once, hated it, and forgot about it. Now, today, I decided to give it a second try and BAM! If my ears had a face, this CD would have punched them in it. Awesome stuff.Thus, I felt so guilty that I had to come on here and spread the good word. Secret Machines, I know you guys read these reviews... well done dudes, rock on."
4,Pretty good,"This is distinctively the Secret Machines, and it's a consistent effort. However, there's no standout track with the power of The Road Leads Where It's Led. This CD is more laid back."
3,So-so,"I've always felt that 'Now Here Is Nowhere' led the listener on an incredible aural journey, but I've listened to this album twice, and it's just not pushing my buttons in the same way that their last did.I'll persevere with it, in the hope that it's a 'grower', but I'm not holding out hope."
3,The potential is still there...,"I found Secret Machines' ""Ten Silver Drops"" impressive and very solid in terms of its production value. Yet, and also in spite of Alan Moulder recording and mixing it, I found myself feeling that the band's sound got old about halfway into every song and at times they didn't stand out much above the sea of manufactured bands with a similar sound ""out there"".I tried listening straight through the entire album three times and found myself skipping songs each time. So I cannot give them more than three stars. I know the potential is still there (it was already there in their first album), but I didn't feel they came through with it this time around."
3,Bang on the bass drum,"You gotta hand to these guys. The lyrics are good innocent high school poetry, but they really work. The musicians have average talent, but with all the effects they use, still get the feeling across. It doesn't bother me at all. And of course the drummer is as solid as you could ever want in a drummer. The amazing thing about this band is the song writing and the styles they borrow and transform into their own special sound. They do alot with what they have. This album is more even than their first one. Not alot of hooks, but consistent. I prefer them live, when they have the freedom to drone on one drum beat as long as they want till you are hypnotized. I'd have to say that this one is not as good as the first one because they don't have anything that compares to ""Now we're Nowhere Now"". This is not a must have, but a worthy effort."
5,Chimene Badi is amazing!,"Chimene Badi is amazing! Not only is she a beautiful woman, she has a beautiful voice! Too bad most of her songs are in french."
4,One of the better guides available,"I visit New Orleans about once every five years, and have been since 1969. Prior to my visits, I try to catch up on what's new. I have found that the Frommer's Guide offers the most useful and practical information, presented in an easy to read and understand format. One regret though, is that the physical size of the guide has grown over the years, it's approaching briefcase size rather than pocket size."
4,House to House,"Well written. Readership for Vietnam War may be flagging due to focus on Iraq. Key characters well portrayed but minor characters sometimes appear to be confusing as if author is attempting to acknowledge absolutely everyone he has interviewed. The result is a need to reread some pages to straighten out the narrative. Some tendency to be negative about higher ranking seniors who may simply be doing their jobs but may have, in the process, offended those who are excessively critical of them."
5,Accurate and Not Pretty,"Well written, well researched and best of all an accurate and not pretty description of what we all know was an very ugly war.I was there. Dustoff Freddy"
4,Great Read But Fair To All Concerned?,"I have read most of the late Mr. Nolan's books and have enjoyed all of them, including ""House to House"" , but I question whether his treatment of the late MG Ewell was fair. I understand the general was a controversial character who arousedstrong emotions in those around him but there seems to be agreement that he was at least competent. COL. Hackworth in his book ""About Face"", clearly did not like the General but respected his ability. I read the General's obituary in the Washington Post and considered it to be something of a hatchet job. I recognize that I never served in the 9th ID and would welcome comments."
4,Five Times Spooky,I've purchased and read the previous 4 volumes from Mark Nesbit and have been equally pleased with the fifth installment of the series. Who would have thought that there could be so many stories and experiences from this one place. SPOOKY!
4,Touched,"Manny--if u are reading this, you are an inspiration! Props to you for a work filled with realism and emotion, and also for having the confidence and vision to lift your life into its proper glory! I haven't seen you in a long time, but I am quite proud from a distance! Keep it up, boy!"
4,A Diamond In The Ruff,"After being given a copy of the young author's truly brilliant first collection of poetry (entitled PIER QUEEN), I wondered how he would do with this, his debut novel. Well, whether CHRIST-LIKE is autobiographical or not, Mr. Xavier's work - written in a style (thank God!) free from the more studied and routine treatments of similar material out there on the market - rings true. The presentation of the characters and the challenging situations are so honest that the effect is as if one is secretly reading another's diary. And it is with this level of honesty that the reader is led to that rare and glorious place of univeral truth. If Mr. Xavier reads this review, please keep me informed as to when the next work is to be published. Thank you."
2,I like Xavier's poetry better but if you like Party Monster this book has the latin flavour to that kind of crowd,As a novelist Manuel is a great poet who needs to fall in love with an editor
2,disapointing,"this talent needs some deep editing. The story was engaging enough, but the writing itself is lacking. But that's the case with most spoken word artists. They sound good, but they speak empty words.Painted Leaf has a habit of throwing out poorly edited crap as evidenced by this book and Besame Mucho. C'mon, Painted Leaf be a trend setter not an exploiter!"
5,Thought provoking,As my title clearing indicates this book is making me take a step back/ timeout to take a look at what is going on around me and how my life in general is going. I'm on my second reading of it as a first reading of this book one cannot digest everything (if you are a beginner). It is clear and concise in its explanation but does repeat a little for your grasping of the concepts at different stages. A very good read!
4,A must read psychology book!,This book was recomended by my psychology teacher. He thaught that this book did an excellent job in defining cognition while hitting some important points about memory.
4,a keeper,"a little dry and lacking colorful diagrams and graphics, but very informative and thorough. i have referenced this book many times since the class i bought it for has ended... a keeper."
3,Review,"This is your typical text book used in college courses. It is very easy to read and make your own notes on each section. I found that at the end of each section, there was a section summary which is helpful. I used the section summaries to study for exams. Overall, I would recommended this book for Psychology majors or anyone else who was interested in cognition."
4,A Hmong love story for the young at heart,"The horrors of war are neither glamorized nor glossed over as they provide the backdrop for this fast paced story of two young people who are forbidden to marry because one was born outside the clan and adopted into it because there were too few boy babies born within. The story is tied together with intrigue and the religious and cultural traditions of the Hmong people of Laos. Because my denomination, the C&MA, has a special interest in the Vietnamease Hmong and has established Hmong congregations in twenty-three states, I found this story especially appealing. Some readers my have difficulty keeping the names of the characters straight since they are hard to pronounce and to remember. A genealogical chart and a pronunciation guide are provided in the front of the book to help with this problem. Churches with missionaries in Southeast Asia will find this story useful when studying the Hmong culture."
5,We had to buy TWO!!!!,"The kids went CRAZY over this one! First the hole in the sand! HOW cool!! All the animals fit, the guys, treasure, or even just the swords and stuff! A great idea! We also like the Tiki hut roof and the log walls, sand floors are really cool and the palm tree rocks!Our creative kids created two sand islands with the sets (Pirate ship added for more walls and floors, and the Nautical 'shipwreck' feel) and then made a big tree with the Lost Fortress... Know what they played? SURVIVOR!!! The tree is Tribal Council, ""the tribe has spoken."" LOL! Tooo fun!Worthy of the price and lots of things to change this one into! Great idea!!!"
2,Too many pieces that fall apart easily,"This looked great on the box... until I opened it and saw the hundreds of pieces. It took me about half an hour to build correctly. There's no way my son (5 years) could've done this. I doubt whether many kids within the recommended age range of 4-10 year could assembly it by themselves. Once it has been put together, it is impressive. However, the pieces don't lock together really securely so it soon falls apart with play. As the pieces fall off, I have to constantly put the thing back together. If I don't, the kids get bored with it. I've no doubt that some of the many pieces will soon get lost as they fall off and it'll be put in the toy graveyard with all of last Christmas's bad choices. I gave a 3 for durability because most of the pieces are fairly unbreakable (unlike PlayMobil) even though the assembled toy falls apart easily."
1,Falls Apart Constantly,"This item is horrible. It falls apart constantly. We tried hot gluing and superglue, however, NOTHING works. Even our 4-1/2 YR son has told us to throw this out he is so frustrated.Part of appeal was you can take Imaginext items & reconfigure them, great concept. However, no matter how you configure them, they ALL fall apart.During assembly notice they do not ""click"" as you would expect. Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom ""base"" pieces.We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart.PLEASE do not waste your money as we have. Unfortunately we spent approximately $150 on various Imaginext last Christmas. Do not make the same mistake we did. When a 4-1/2 YR wants you to throw out his toys, somethings wrong!"
1,Buy Playmobil Instead,"My four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother. He already had pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets. Well, set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as he began to play with it, pieces fell apart. NOTE: he is NOT a careless child, nor is he rough with toys. But this toy doesn't stand up to even the most basic four year old play.After he had had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just boxed it. We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale. I just hope those people don't come back to reclaim their money. Save yourself the pain and frustration and buy Playmobil's Pirate Lagoon -- this is just a cheap knockoff."
1,Island,I would very much like to know where I can buy this so I could give a review. It is shown on the box of the ship but I can not find it anywhere. Please advise me.Thank you
4,Great book for the first time vistor to the area,Me and my fours kids set out for a spring break week in waterfall country after reading about it in National Geographic's Traveler magazine. Bought this book while there. Very easy directions to follow and let me know whether the kids could hike the distance to some of the falls. Best vaction we ever had and cheap!
4,Waterfalls- he's got 'em.,"Kevin Adams has made a remarkably complete inventory of the Tar Heel state's waterfalls. This book, which naturally includes many, many photos, has pretty good directions on how to find these falls and great advice on waterfall photography (it's harder than you think). My only complaints: (1) At times the author seems a bit full of himself (I mean his name is Kevin, not Ansel, right?) and (2) there are lots of falls which aren't pictured. Some people might prefer the joy of first viewing the falls in person, but I wish he had included photos of each and every falls described in the book. But, hey, this is more a field guide than a coffee table book. 'Course you'll still want to put it on your coffee table."
4,"Nice book, especially for the photographer / hiker","If you like to get out with your camera and take some excellent hikes and pictures this is a very well rounded book. Good directions, descriptions of the falls and even suggestions for the best way to photograph the falls. Most of these are not road side falls so if you are looking for that, you might be disapointed but that is not the fault of the author, the majority of the ""good"" falls are not on main highways!"
1,What a misleading RIPOFF,"The picture shows a box.The product description says the box contains 60 DVD-R disks.When you get it, there is only ONE 2-pack of disks.Not on the product description, but elesewhere about the product,so the lawyers can say We Told You So, it says one 2-pack.FALSE ADVERTISING."
4,I had to buy this book!,"This book has given me new perspective.Instead of accepting my situation and moaning about it, I think it's time for me to ""Earn What I'm Worth."" Helpful for those who need a little push or have no idea where to begin."
3,Good book,"Sound advice that you can use. Over all, I liked the book although I think the title is a little overhyped."
2,OK but not great,These are not as useful and practical as the folding binsFabric Folding Bin - Sage. We originally were going to use them on our baby changing table but have the bins now instead and use the baskets for storage in our closet. The liners are really synthetic feeling so we threw them away as they are not really necessary. They don't hold as much as you think they will and are not as sturdy as they look.
4,Dyspraxia Developmental Co-ordination Disorder,This is an outstanding book. It is extremely helpful and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a child that has been diagnosed with developmental dyspraxia. I only wish I had discovered it 10 years ago. Now we are playing catch-up but it provides very helpful information for our family and is teaching us how to make our child's life easier.
2,Tough to Clean Up,"I purchased this product to lubricate the tuning slides on my trumpet and flugelhorn. I haven't used this particular Selmer product for years. The company must have changed the formula because clean up is much more of a chore than I remember. The tuning slides move easily, but it was very difficult and took a lot of work to remove the excess grease from the finish of the horns. Can't say I'll use it again."
3,Decent but not amazing,Works well but you need to water it down with valve oil. My biggest problem is it gets all over everything. If you take it on a plane the pressure can make the bottle split open at the seams. This happened to me once. Total mess.
3,Thick and hard to squeeze out,"While the product works quite well, it has a couple drawbacks. It is very thick which makes it quite difficult to squeeze out of the tube. It takes a lot of effort to get a little bit of grease out. More importantly, it is difficult to clean up as it smears on the instrument when you wipe off any excess. It does do a good job coating slides, particularly the tuning slide. I have used valve oil to thin the grease on my first and third valve slides. Personally, I do prefer using Hetman products as they work much better, are easier to use, and last just as long."
5,Great Cork Grease Replacement!!!!,"I have used this product for many years to grease the corks on my saxophones and clarinet. It works much better than any of the normal cork grease products you can purchase, as it does a better job of soaking into the cork to keep it moisturized. It only takes a couple of dabs of this on the cork...then simply rotate your mouthpiece around as you slide it on the neck to spread it to the entire cork surface. I thought this product was no longer available...until I saw this today! Whew...I'm back in business! Highly recommended product...based on more than 30 years of using it in the ""real world""! :-)"
3,Glorify Him With Louisiana Mass Choir of GMWA!!!,"This album was originally released on Testament Records in 1989. In '97, Paula Records digitally remastered the album. This album features some pretty good songs like I Will Wait On The Lord, I Know What Prayer Can Do, I Am The Way, and I Want To Be Used. The sound quality wasn't the best though. Overall, I enjoyed the album. It is well-worth buying."
4,Incredible Despite The High Price,"I had the opportunity to preview this product in philosophy's Radiant Face In A Box kit(available at Sephora.com). It is wonderful, but very high priced...that is my only concern. Twosteps are involved-a vitamin C exfoliator that goes on like acream but becomes a massaging scrub, and a white cream activatorthat becomes a tingling rinse off mask when applied to the C complex. It is invigorating but in no way harsh, and has a tingling but soothing citrus smell and feel. My skin was stillbaby soft the next day! An increbible product to use with puritymade simple and hope in a jar, if you can afford it!"
4,Great Product. Stinky Smell.,"It took a few days for me to see results, but after like the 4th day of use I woke up, looked in the mirror and was dumbfounded! I was very suprised to see that the product claims were true. My skin was definitely smoother & more pores were hardly noticeable. I have to admit that I was skeptical & hesitant to spend this much money. The only complaint I have is the smell of the Hope in a Jar moisturizer. It has lactic acid in it so the smell isn't that pleasant, but it doesn't keep me from using it daily."
3,THIS IS FOR COLLECTORS OF OLDER CARDS,"I READ THE BOOK MANY YEARS AGO AND IT WAS DATED THEN. I HAVE COLLECTED FOR 44 YEARS AND LOVE THE HOBBY, BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO TEACH ANYONE ENOUGH ABOUT THE HOBBY TODAY TO BUY THE BOOK. IT IS SEMI INTERESTING BUT I THINK THAT IT IS FOR THE MID 80'S NOT TODAY.MR. PEARLMAN IS VERY KNOWLEDGABLE AND THE BOOK WILL GIVE YOU A GREAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FROM THE DAYS GONE BY. IT IS FUN TO REMEMBER THE PAST, YET WITH TODAYS ISSUES WITH CARDS AND THE HORRID AMOUNT OF CARDS BEING PRODUCED, THE DAYS OF COLLECTING AND TRADING ARE STILL HERE FOR THE CHILDREN. BUT WHEN I SEE A CHILD OPEN A $20.00 PACK OF CARDS AND IMMDIATELY LOOK AT A PRICE GUIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY ARE WORTH (ACORDING TO THE GUIDES), FOR ME IT THAS TAKEN THE JOY OF THE SPORT AND COLLECTING AWAY. THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY CHANGES SINCE THE PUBLISHING OF THIS BOOK THAT IT IS GOOD FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO COLLECT OLDER CARDS ONLY."
5,With case histories of good and bad practices alike,"Kim MacPherson's Permission-Based E-mail Marketing That Works tells how to create a budget for permission-based email campaigns, explore tailing such emails to retain profitable customers, and tells how to acquire and retain such customers. Case histories of good and bad practices alike provide strong insights on communications and etiquette."
3,Kim **NOW is the perfect time to revise your book**,"Time passes and this book now needs to be revised. TheM/s Mac Pherson gives you all the skills you need toget to the place you should have been two years ago.For example no mention is made of autoreponders. Todayalmost all permission based systems now make use ofautoresponders as an efficient method that ensuresquick replies to new leads and immediately deliversthat special offer, white paper etc.Also it is rather quaint that there seems to be noweb page associated with the book. A place to log onto give my permission for the author to send me hernewsletter and receive a personal email from Kimpromoting her new book or on line web conference.Although squarely based on permission marketing theword SPAM is treated more as a sick relative ratherthan the final attack of an infinity of verbal locustshatched for a world without meaning.Kim, It's time to hide from the family again andwrite an all NEW edition on How to do it right today."
1,Just doesn't fit,"To get a taste of the music that was used for this, check out ""Vampire Rituals: Gothic Music From The Deepest Depths Of Hell,"" which was also put out by Cleopatra Records. Needless to say, it is NOT industrial music. The music just doesn't work with the movie. Any music producer could have a great time choosing the correct music to compliment the action in the movie, but this just seems to be dark/ambient music overlaid on a silent film. The worst part was watching the terrifying carriage ride with mellow, dark, ambient music. It took the terror and dread out of the scene.If you like this movie (as I do) and you like dark music (as I do), the best choice is Nosferatu with the Type O Negative soundtrack. Search Amazon for ""Nosferatu - The First Vampire."" That one uses the music and the movie to their full potential."
3,Disappointed with the music,"The other descriptions provide very good explanations of the advantages of this DVD. The one big flaw is that the included musical scores ruined the suspense of the film. The newer symphony recording seemed goofy, the organ score was more acceptable but for some reason soothed the creepiest scenes.There was a version I saw on VHS several years ago (probably expurgated more than this one) that had a sparse and unsettling soundtrack that fit the movie perfectly. It wasn't well recorded, but that only made it fit all the better. Wish I knew which version that was..."
4,Nosferatu looks better than ever,"This version of Nosferatu looks as good as the movie ever will. The color tints are done tastfully, without attracting too much attention to them, the score is both effective, yet subtle and the print quality is the best I've ever seen. Part of the appeal of this film, despite the legendary stories behind the making of the film and its infamous cast, is the fact that people and places don't look the same as they did in 1922. No amount of makeup, set design, or costume could ever account for 80 years of history. Something about this movie is and has always been simply captivating."
5,Silent creeps,Great movie. It is very creepy. The fact that it is silent and black and white makes it creepier. Max Schreck is a hideous Count Orlok.
4,Different soundtracks make big diffeence.,"""Disgruntled"" refers to a previous review and not Nosferatu.There are a number of different ""versions"" of this movie distributed by different companies. I bought the Keno version, and the transfer and tint quality are excellent. However, I had previously seen the movie with a pipe organ arrangement and was dissapointed with the orchestral arrangements on the Keno DVD. Not that there is anything bad with the music, it's just that the pipe organ creates a creepier mood for me. I then bought the Image companies offering and am very pleased with the pipe organ soundtrack, though the DVD transfer is not quite as good as the Keno. I would have given 5 stars if the Keno video and the Image audio were on the same DVD. Oh, and the audio commentary is admirable in ponting out the symbolism and stlye of the film. great movie."
5,The Ancient One,We are accustomed to LISTEN movies. Bad habit. New soundtracks are superfluous for genuine silent film.You've seen NOSFERATU before and were not impressed enough? Really?Turn sound off. Try again.You'll be chilled with the difference.
5,Count Orlock 1st vampire in movies.,"Nosferatu was a well made slient film of a vampire named Count Orlock. I loved every minute of it. Orlock has the scariest face and fingers. It was so well made but then in 2002 or so they took this movie and put gothic music for it which wasnt so bad either. Knowing that this was a gothic movie back in the day. I love this movie, it would be my all time fav vampire movie ever."
3,Mildly disappointed,"Mildly DisappointedNosferatu - Special Edition: Although the added color tints and new musical and organ scores might lure the newer movie connoisseurs and critics, the purist will be sadly disappointed that the original unmodified release and score is not available on this disc. Another disappointing fact is that not once is the original release year mentioned on the cover/insert - something I consider a must. While I welcome remake technology and enjoy it's new dimension, without a baseline knowledge of the original context, it's like trying to understand Shakespeare by only reading the Cliffs Notes.What saves this release is the excellent commentary track, the `then and now' comparisons which beautifully highlight poignant scenes to how they look and exist today (example: opening scene of Wismar city center in 1922 and present day), and the still gallery which provides even more material for the movie and history buff."
3,This movie is pretty boring,"I love old movies generally...that is why I thought that I would love this movie. I didn't. I am sure that in it's day it was really amazing. However, I can't imagine being scared by this movie. I mean, the vampire looks very creepy, but there is no suspense. I never once thought ""Oh no, what's going to happen?"" I even left the room and went looking for a snack. I sure wish that I had rented this movie and I sugjest that to all who are curious and I would say, yes this movie is worth renting because it is so old and has a certain artistic quality that is worth seeing once."
3,a old dracula,Face it the movie is good but the muisc is harrible. the movie does not have Dracula in it insted he is named Orlock! The movie is set in germy and the castle is more like a dump. yet this is a great film.
1,A curiosity but hardly watchable.,"A renowned and influential work of movie history that manages to tell the story of Dracula at a sufficiently vibrant pace. Since the story has been done so many times since, it is entirely predictable to the modern viewer, and the melodramatic pantomime of the day causes what was once a very frightening film to seem rather comical."
2,Watch out! Nofsreatu is a really old movie!,"Some body told me that I should see this movie because its supposed to br the first Dracula movie and I like vampire movies alot. But this movie is'nt even about Dracula as far as I can tell! For one thing his name is'nt even Dracula its Count Nofsreatu! And he does'nt even wear a cape! And this movie is way too old IMHO. Its like the acters don't even know how to act! Its not evey scarey! Do yourself a faver and watch one of the Newer Dracula movies like Lost Boys or Blade 2. Those movies have lots of aciton and blood that Nofsreatu does'nt have (and their in color, I might add). If you wan't to go to sleep watch this movie! Ill give it 2 stars because theres a vampire in it. Bwa ha ha!"
5,The Original Dracula Movie,"This silent classic is the original DRACULA adaptation. Some say it is the most frightening one. Taking Bram Stoker's novel and turning it into a masterpiece. Some names had to be changed around from the novel when Stoker's wife found his novel was being filmed without proper permission. Count Orlok, the rodentlike vampire is perhaps the most animalistic screen portrayal of a vampire ever filmed. Defiantly a must have if you are into horror movies."
5,Creepy Classic,"Despite the German names, this is the classic silent version of DRACULA. Max Schreck makes a perfectly creepy Dracula, called Orlock in this film, with his rat-like face, elongated hands, and looming shadows. This is a classic example of German Expressionism in film. The tinting and sharpness of the print makes this a silent film treasure to enjoy. The audio commentary is also very helpful for the film student. If you like silent films, this is one I highly recommend."
5,As scary as it was so many years ago,"this movie is a great example of movie making at its finest. The eerie atmosphere makes dialogue unecessary and the creepy black and white tones complement this as well. Note: many versions of this movie are available, many which include 20 minutes of more film. The alpha film versions states it ontains 85 or so minutes but the case claims only 64."
4,music really adds to the movie,"Alright, first off I'm not some kind of black eyeliner wearing goth lover who enjoys being depressed all the time. I am a fan of classic horror and there is no greater originator of classic horror than Nosferatu. Here we have a version with an updated score consisting of three minute fragments of not nessisarily heavy metal gothic music but just overall errie sounding. I liked it. As far as the movie goes I've read that there are better coppies out there but unfortunaltly I have been unable to find one where certain parts are not cropped. Still, a teriffic movie even if Barbra Strisand had done the score which might actually be scarier."
2,Nosferatu,"This film was okay. I did not realize that it was not a talky,but that was okay. I should have realized that it wasn't a talky, that was my fault. It will go good with my collection."
3,Good movie bad DVD,I'm going to keepit short its a good film avery bad dvd I watched for an hour and was very jumpy and when I looked to see if there were any sratches or finger prints there were'nt
4,A Great Piece In Vampire Film History,"This is the first known Dracula story put on film. A silent film, it is not for mainstream audiences anymore, but for those that are either interest in film history, or vampire in film history.There are tons of extras here. The commentary track is pretty informative.One thing I have noticed on these reviews here is that Amazon.com has integrated the reviews of the VHS release of this movie, which had a Type O Negative soundtrack. Please be aware that this DVD has no such soundtrack. It is the original.Overall a good DVD since I am one of those whom likes to follow vampires in film and in literature."
5,The original and still the best,"What can I say? Max Schreck's performance as the title character is so powerful, it has seeped its way into the works of Spielberg, Coppola, and popular culture at large. A fabulous film. The years have not tainted it nor reduced its shock and horror value. Watch it. For your own good. I dare you."
4,Here's the REAL thing,"This film shows that you need no special effects, no gore, no shrieks to make a truly frightening film, and you need no bouncing on the bed to make a really sensuous film. There is hardly a more frightening scene than Nosferatus appearance on the haunted ship, and the final seduction of the vampire is full of morbid sensuality. Max Schrecks Nosferatu has none of the redeeming sex-appeal of Dracula, he is just a nasty, otherwordly creature bent on destruction. I saw this first when I was a child and I haven't yet gotten over the fright."
3,Watch in Silence,"This could have been a beautiful, artistic, provocative movie recommended to anyone who loves the cinema. Instead, it is an artistic failure! The ""avantgarde"" score (imagine bongos, bells and synethesizers!) provided by The Silent Orchestra (should have stayed that way!) is distracting, cacophonous, and woefully out-of-sync with the visuals. For the best results, turn off the sound until the more traditional organ score returns. Better yet, purchase the DVD version of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari to see a bona fide artistic masterpiece, that masterfully integrates the audio with the visual!"
5,A must have for a genre fan!!!,"I first saw this film in late October 2003 on TCM and was, quite frankly, astounded. I have a commercial version of this film on VHS (approx. 68 minutes). I watched this remastered version for TWENTY MINUTES before I saw a single scene from my edition. I even discovered scenes that are misplaced in my VHS copy. If you are a fan of the silent, impressionistic film genre or a fan of vintage horror or vampire films, this piece is a MUST HAVE for your collection. The subtitles and the music have been greatly enhanced. BUY IT! This is not mere pieces of film spliced callously together. This truly is Nosferatu as it was originally intended to be seen!"
2,Nosferatu ( Alpha Video release ),"This dvd has my favorite soundtrack for this film, however, it is out of sync with the video! (which basically ruins it )The chapter selection is flawed also: there are only 4 chapter selections to choose from; chapter 2 is labeled chapter 1, and so on... so there is no selection for chapter 1.The title menu is also extremely cheap, showing a small photo of the cover of the dvd case on a background closely resembling the old windows 95 'blue sky with clouds' background image.Last, and certainly not least, the video quality is terrible.This one probally isn't worth getting unless you're planning on remastering the dvd with the soundtrack in sync with the video for personal use, and with a decent chapter selection menu. I hope to find that someone has already put a nice version together with this soundtrack on dvd ( I know it exists on vhs )."
1,Nosferatu - Special Edition Max Schreck,"I purchased the Special Edition and the video was wonderfulbut the sound track was so bad that I could not watch themovie with it on. If you are serious about buying a copy ofthis movie, find the Nosferatu web site first and read aboutthe sound track that are in use. The sound track on thisrecording sounds like a 1950's jazz track with a lot ofbrushed cymbals. The Man With the Golden Arm is what comes tomind. There are many good sound tracks out there. Find thegood one before you purchase."
1,Weird ...,"Seems like a good idea at first, to combine old visual with a modern audio.Anyhow - it doesn't work. The 1920's interpretation has it's time-stamp, which is unique, unrepeatable, unreachable at any other time ...Adding an industrial mix sounds to me just like a poor wash-pan-attempt of a couple of people, to parasite on a classic. Very simmilar to the puppets' ""Hard Day's Night"" given in Prague for foreigner.My personal recomendation is - just walk it by.I've ben force to rate i 1 star. IMHO - zero would suit better."
4,This Review Pertains to the 2001 Image Entertainment edition,"As mentioned, This Review Pertains to the 2001 Image Entertainment edition only...I do not own or care to own the Kino version, which maybe longer[...] one version is all I need, and this version is good enough for me.It is by far very different then the 1931 Bella Dracula version...and more scary too. I love to watch different era's of film to compare things with like the 1931 Dracula and this silent Nosferatu film. Lighting - special effects, camera techniques, etc. Acting also was rather different from the silent era to the talkey era.I took a film history course in High School - and this is one the films mention about, but never showned, since when I was in school, they did not have Nosferatu available on video at that time. There was a picture of the movie in the history books, but that was all."
2,Great film-bad music track,"The music track of this version is made up of various romantic symphonies and overtures. At first the effect seems quite pleasing. Then you realize that no attempt has been made to match the mood of the visuals with the music, so you end up with things like a light-hearted scherzo during the first appearance of the vampire, or Dvorak's ""New World"" symphony over the arrival of the vampire in Bremen. The music track eventually becomes an unbearable distraction and the only thing to do is to hit the mute button."
3,"For fans of Goth/Industrial, worth a buy","I thought on the whole the music was very fitting, I sort of find it running through my head, which is sort of disconcerting. On the down side, yes, they can't make up their minds whether it is Dracula or Orlock, and there are other things that are rather disturbing from an authenticity standpoint. To me, there is no excuse for not using the original names and places and so forth - tinting as well, to get as close to Murnau's original film as possible. Had they placed this music with a more faithful rendition of the film, I would be 100% happy because I think the music is a great fit for Nosferatu."
2,Unfortunate Edition,"This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood. I'm not sure when this ""score"" was ""written"", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film. Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film. With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while. If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition."
2,Nost for me!,DIE Ted Turner!Ted ruined forever our ability to see some movies as they are best seen and remembered. I don't WANT Nosferatu in color. I want it in B&W. Now i have to look for it (already) in used video stores.All is LostRicky
2,Nosferato/Orlock A rose by any other name,"Have seen this movie with the haunting,eery piano soundtrack that made this masterpiece truly scary. The sound track on this flick is a bore/tedium and takes away the frightening element with added sounds that are just plain stupid. The music in most part is lousy. Orlock/Nosferato is a horror story not some kind of sick joke.Bring me the pounding on the piano any time.The 3D is remarkably good for a century old film. But they knew about 3D way back then.Tromeo studios is truly pathetic. They are not campy. They have no talent whatsoever except for one middle aged actor who is polished among the most polished in the field. He takes a role, I assume when he flat broke."
1,Ol' Jug Ears,The great big distraction is the surprisingly modern and way-too-light musical score over the visuals which is a shame because the footage itself has a wonderful archival feel as though retrieved from a dusty sea-chest from within a spooky attic.This vampire has big ears that are comical to the point if distraction.A classic in its day but then the public were reeling from the magic of the newly invented cinema in any case.Nosferatu by Werner Herzog is far better. Klaus Kinski is responsible for the most ghoulish eerily real presence on film I have ever seen.
3,"Innovative, but practically does not work that well.","The Odyssey LSTAND is a very innovative product, and I would like to see more like it. Unfortunately, its innovations do not hold up so well in practical terms. The main issue with this stand is that it is unstabled. Since the left, right, top, and bottom of the stand are essentially de-coupled and hence flexible even when fully assembled, it is extremely difficult to get anything but a wobbly stand. I really wanted to like this item, but I do not trust putting anything of value on top of or below it, as it is unstable no matter how much time you spend trying to get it stable. I spent a good hour tweaking the knobs and eventually gave up - either the metal is warped or the design just plain has too much flex for a sturdy fit."
2,"If you're looking for Pro-grade, look further","The L-Stand is pretty shoddily constructed. The threads are soft and will strip easily. The machining is not to strict tolerance, for sure. Easy to set up, but when all put together it lacks stability. It's not going to fall over, but if you're using really using it to dj in club settings, I don't know if I'd feel comfortable with my laptop on it hovering over my equipment. If you're a hobbyist and want something relatively cheap to hold your laptop, it will get the job done."
1,Disappointed,Well i dont know where to start. i was happy when i saw other reviews from past users so i went ahead and i choose this stand. sad to say when i started assembling the unit there were some factory faults with the threads for screwing. the bar which goes across were too small at the ends and they weren't able to screw on. they would just fit it and then fall off. now i have to sort our the threads because sending it back from my country will be too much.
2,Un-Reliable; Don't waste your money,"This stand isn't worth the money. Laptop stands rely completely on balance which is the main reason why I'm giving this stand a bad rating. The problem I experienced with this stand was the threading with the screws. The rods that attach to each leg include extenders for your laptop size. However the extenders had stripped threading thus the balance was not level. In fact some of them didn't screw together at all, even after trying different combinations.Overall I wouldn't purchase this stand. I'm not sure if I received a faulty one or if they're all constructed the same way. My advice would be to save your money and purchase one with higher quality."
3,Works as described but missing parts,"I bought this to position a lightweight 61 key keyboard over my 88 key keyboard that's sitting on top of a nice piece of furniture in my studio. There was no other product in the market designed specifically for this purpose and I was successful in making this work.It came without the bolts and nuts and washers the packing materials said were supposed to be in the box. Fortunately, I had some laying around the house that worked."
1,"Dont bother, spend your money on another item.","Dont bother, spend your money on another item. Just trying to lock IT!so your Laptop wont FALL off!! is crazy. I had to look at the pic's on the boxjust to get it together.LAST this is for SALE for $29 ! else where! the same item with locksLAST this is for SALE for $29 ! else where! the same item with locksLAST this is for SALE for $29 ! else where! the same item with locksOh ya New not OLD/Used/ Google it to FIND it Lower.so DONT SPEND $43 & AGAIN $$ SAVE your MONEY $$"
3,"Sharp as a razor, but a little too personal","Throughout the poems I collected as my favorites from Autumn Sleep and Roots in Winter, sharpness prevails. ""Winter thunder. / There in a shaving glass / razor waits poised"" (p. 10; probably the best poem) sets the tone of this collection.Illness, the violence of life, and death. The predicted future overshadows yet sharpens Richmond's creation. On the other hand, the frequent reference to his own illness makes his poems sound too personal and exclusive.Shiki Masaoka, who turned hokku into haiku and was also ill, kept graveness at bay and aimed at karumi, ""lightness"". Richmond's style is quite unique in haiku, but not in English-language poetry.I like the fact that he doesn't pretend to know the Japanese psyche like many haiku poets do, and the poem he wrote after Kyoshi Takahama (p. 21) is one of the finest piece of haiku in English: ""Summer moon / on a dish a lone apple / loses its blush"""
2,Too shallow,"I will start with the book's bright point: every chapter starts with an amazing photograph, which really captures something ""divine"".And moving on, I'll get to the actual content.Ajahn Sumedho's book offers buddhist reflections on life. However, judging by the book, these are very shallow reflections.The book does wrong to Buddhism's deep insights and philosophy.There's nothing in the book which you haven't heard before: Be kind and good, accept life,be generous, etc. To me, almost nothing inspired, just old cliches about the spiritual life.And of course, don't expect any practical advice, like meditation techniques.Maybe this book will help total newbies to get acquainted with Buddhism, but still there are far better books. One can try for example Ajahn Brahm's books, for an inspiring stories and just a good laugh.Those famaliar with Buddhism- stay away, because you're likely to get bored!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Here, Alex Ross and Paul Dini take a crack at the Big Red Cheese, and he is definitely in Big Red Cheese mode in this book. Ross has again done a fine job with his artwork, and so this is very nice to look at, as we see both Captain Marvel and Billy Batson enjoy their lives and take down the odd villain in the process."
2,Wisdom of Soloman?,Within the first 10 pages of this very short story we see Captain Marvel telling a group of sick children how he took muzzled grizzly bears and threw them up in the air and juggled them as part of a circus act all to the kids great amusment. I guess the Captain's compassion only extends so far. The sick kids in the story are bringing tears to readers eyes at the same time they gloss over other forms of abuse. The god of empathy was obviously forgotten when these authors revisioned Shazam!
4,"Standard light bulbs, but good value for money.",These light bulbs are great and ship fast. I would definitely buy them again for the lamp I purchased as well.
1,I cut my hand opening this product cause they sent me a damaged piece,terrible why package a heavy lamp with four glass bulbs that are not protected by a decent box.The last time i boiught this product they sent me the bulbs seperately. I am shocked how much down the drain this product has gone
3,Jamie Foxx-I Might Need Security,"I don't follow much of Jamie's Acting Career as I am more of a Fan of his In Living Color Days and his comedy,I found it funny except in the parts of Bush Bashing and the saving our own(to some degree yes you should),But his take on Giraffes and the Sexual habits of Lions as well as the faces which is what makes Jamie Really funny to his meeting Prince and feeling ""attracted"" to him which is bizarre and disgusting yet the way he pulls it off is funny,and his Beef With L L(Who's way in over his head anyway)an overall Good act and Typical Jaime."
5,i watched this and....and...OH I CAN'T HELP IT HE'S SO FINE!,"yes dammit! i watched this and i just love him!!! i just love looking at this man! i loved this show and i'm gonna order it, just so i can look at him again! i'm sorry, but i have to confess, i have dreams about Jamie Foxx! There! i said it! lol. yes, i know i'm crazy i'm crazy as a Foxx!.....ok, i looked at his show and it was funny and i truly enjoyed it. now i got to go fan myself, because just thinking about him gives a sista hotflashes! lol! whew"
2,Not Funny,"I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all."
2,not impressed,"Jamie foxx needs a little help here. Although some things were funny, His mouth was filthy."
1,Notta,"We have here, not a comedian, but a blundering idiot, uncognizant to his trite, underwhelming, overdone routine. I feel like he just told stories which I can get during Thanksgiving by relatives who can throw a punchline or at least choke on a shot of whiskey, for a laugh. Vulgarity does not mean hilarity, and I have seen many comedians who have not attained Jamie's success, yet are smart and witty. And look at his creative title; I Might Need Security. Make up your damn mind Jamie. Either your a crappy comedian or a crappy actor. You don't negate the crap by choosing both."
4,Don't Dismiss!,"Although the humor is spotty, there are many laugh out loud sequences. (I count the Prince sequence as one of my absolute favorites.) Do not judge this by the HBO special, or even the VHS. The DVD includes so much more priceless airtime. Stay tuned after the credits to learn why you must buy his next musical album, then stay for the next two encores to find why he is the people's comedian!"
3,"You have to really, really like Jamie Foxx to enjoy this","I think Jamie Foxx is funny and all, but he can't really hold your attention for a whole show. I couldn't even remember half of the stuff he said. The only part I vaguely remember is when he was talking about Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. Also, I disagree with the reviewer that said you'd like Jamie if you like Eddie Murphy. No disrespect toward Jamie, but how can you match Eddie's relatable stories and dead-on impressions? Watch this special only if nothing else is on.Anthony Rupert"
2,maynard,I agree with handsome johnny on an earlier review. The book had no depth and I thought hastily put together. There was true history of people that came to her book signings bringing in maps of early Lansing and photographs. A book of this nature takes a long time to research out not just a couple years. Needed more. Perhaps Carrie could do it again another volume before the rest of the true pioneers of Lansing are dead.
1,Why would anyone would be interested in what this convicted felon (freed on a technicality by right-wing cronies) has to say?,"That this guy has an audience at all is simply further evidence of the dumbing down of America. My one-star rating was compelled by Amazon, which does not provide for minus stars."
3,Promising debut,"Judging by their debut album, Muse are in love with their guitars. Which is no surprise seeing as their heroes are Radiohead and Nirvana. The songs on 'Showbiz' aren't tuneful in the pop-rock sense, but repeated listens show that these are songs of substance. I'd say 'Muscle Museum' is the most immediate of the tracks, while some of the songs aren't all that bad. Though they're not particularly outstanding either. Yeah, Matt Bellamy does sound like Thom Yorke, but there's still enough individuality is his style to distinguish himself and his band from their heroes. Other notable songs are 'Sunburn' and 'Filip'. If 'Showbiz' is a portent of what is to follow from Muse, then I'll certainly be one of those watching out for these lads."
1,Cover does not look like the one shown in the picture,"I'm giving it at 1 star rating to this product because I bought it as ""NEW"" with original labels, however when I received it I noticed that the labels shown in the picture were not there, plus the wrapping looks homemade which tells me this is not a new product which is what I paid for. I could've paid much less money for a new product from a different seller.I contacted the seller before purchasing this product and I was told : ""yes, this product is new"" . Please be careful when buying something from this seller and make sure you are paying for somethig new and not used."
3,A lukewarm first album,"This Muse's debut album, and it's rather average. It actually has quite a similar ""sound"" to their later albums, with a mix of hard and soft-sounding rock songs, except that the songs aren't as easy to listen to, and the songs themselves are less interesting. I did fall in love with ""Sunburn"" and give it 5 stars. ""Cave"", ""Muscle Museum"" and the balladic ""Unintended"" aren't too bad either. The rest or the songs are mediocre, which is why I average the album 3 stars. If you're trying out Muse for the first time, purchase ""Absolution"" instead."
3,A good album,"This is a fine album but they do sound a lot like Radiohead!They have also been heavily influenced by The Smashing Pumpkins though the popular music press would have you believe they've been more influenced by Nirvana(typical of the prejudiced way the Pumpkins are treated compared to Nirvana in general).If it wasn't for the sometimes lack of originality,this album would be one of the great debuts of all time.They are outstandingly talented musicians though and Matt's a great vocalist."
3,More amazed than amused,"3 1/2While everyone was being distracted by their increasingly epic releases, this straightforward guitar-driven debut was relegated to encasement around here, only to have its ambitious energy affirmed with impressive if seldom revisitation."
4,"Too good, too young.","Like Radiohead? I am a huge Radiohead and have to disagree, this is not how I would pigeon hole them at all. You can't liken them to any particular person, they are awesome live and the CD is also very, very good. If you like good, funky, twisted music then this is for you."
5,Drawn in from the beginning,"I have to admit that I was drawn to Muse at first because I thought they sounded like Radiohead, but after buying this cd and listening to it many many many times, I'm finding new reasons to name Muse as one of my top-five favorite bands. The music is fantastic and all the songs have something a little different to offer than the one before, so playing the album isn't like listening to the same song over and over. I like Matthew Bellamy's voice, and his range is amazing. Definitely a good cd worth your time and money."
4,Better than Radiohead? I don't think so.,They rock. That can't be denied. But to say they are better than Radiohead is absurd. Nobody can make you as depressed as Thom Yorke.
5,absoulty wicked,this has got to be one of the best albums i've ever brought. I firt saw them at glastonbury and they were amazing. if you like them then see them live and you will like them even more!!
3,Muse are not the Monkees!,"I just read the below review from B.D. Love regarding Muse's recent concert at the Greek. I attended the show also and take issue with his assertion that Muse played little of the music live. That is total B.S. Very rarely were tapes used, and that was just because Matt Bellamy (understandably) can't always duplicate the multi-tracked keyboard parts that are on the albums by himself. As far as guitar tapes, I don't what the reviewer is smoking - not once was there a guitar sound that Bellamy wasn't actually playing live. It's highly doubtful that Love was even at the show, so please ignore his review."
3,This is how Muse used to sound??????,"Needless to say I like Muse a lot, they're my 3rd favorite band, and I had only 2 albums, Black Holes and Absolution, before buying this. Anyways, I picked this up the other day, because I was curious to hear Muse's debut. It's not a bad album... it's not much of an album really, it's more of a taste of things to come than anything. I like ""Muscle Museum"", ""Unintended"", ""Hate This and I'll Love You"" and ""Sober"". The rest is all... ehhh to me. That said I can excuse that. This was their first album and they were still searching for that sound. Needless to say, Origin of Symmetry is a better album and has their best track, ""New Born"", which was used at the end of ""Haute Tension""."
4,Seeds of greatness,"It's not so simple to write a debut that doesn't feel like something you've already heard. What does meke the difference anyway? That feeling of expressive power that makes you say ""here is somebody that has something new to say"" they can bacome big. I think for Muse this is the case, so with Radiohead in lack of inspiration (heard Kid A?) let's try it!"
5,come waste your millions here...,"Well it wouldn't actually be wasting considering that this is one great cd! Yes, they sound a bit like Radiohead but after listening to the cd repeatedly the difference is quite clear. I believe that I will be keeping a close eye on this little band and waiting patiently for more awesome tunes."
4,"Very, very nice!","I only heard of Muse because I was visiting London and the song ""Sunburn"" was EVERYWHERE. Now, that song is one of the best I've heard in a while, and believe you me, that says a lot! I've bought the CD first thing when I got back to the States, and I must say it's pretty enjoyable. ""Muscle Museum"", ""Fillip"" and ""Cave"" are very impressive! Now, Muse might be dismissed as Radiohead clones by the critics, but as a music fan I think that music itself should come BEFORE the question of who's imitating who, and what Muse does on ""Showbiz"" is excellent!"
5,Promising Beginning,"Muse's debut ""Showbiz"" despite being an immensely beautiful album is still pretty much anchored in the coordinates of their two main influences-Radiohead and Jeff Buckley(""Unintended""is the best ballad Jeff Buckley never wrote)which doesn't mean it's not filled with great songs,only that Muse hadn't by then found their own voice.In their search for na original sound they bulit this endlessly charming melodic rock album that boasts some of the cusp of the century's best tunes-""Muscle Museum"",""Sunburn"",""Unintended"",""Escape""and""Hate this and I'll love you"" among the top picks."
4,Wows me everytime,"This album contains the song that led me to falling in love with the group. ""Muscle Museum"". While I prefer their more recent album ""Absolution"", this album is still amazing.It starts off with an explosive song called ""Sunburn"", and the rest of the songs are pretty mellow. All amazing in themselves, and given just that much more as you listen to the singer's voice, which, in my case, really adds that extra something to the music. He knows the music, and he matches the emotion to the music so you can really feel the words, and yet, you can still sing to the songs.A great addition to any music library.....highly reccommended, along with ""Absolution""."
4,Order this!!,"This album has very very special place in my heart.My musical taste wasn't very developed until I heard ""Sunburn"".Before that I was casual listener,who didn't know anything about alternative bands. But Muse really rised my interest and through the web I learned more.After I heard Muscle Museum,I decided to order this album. The reason I give it *only* 4 stars is that there is still something that can be better.I can't put my fingers on it.Maybe they just need to grow more as a band. There isn't any song I dislike.Usually I listen the whole album.Still,every song has different atmosphere,so I may sometimes skip the songs that aren't equal to my state of mind at the time. So,if you like Nirvana,Radiohead,and all other alternative music,you should order this album. Muse has their own sound,though.Matt's voice is maybe similar to Thom Yorke's(my other fave,BTW)but the sounds are pure Muse! I can't wait their second album!"
4,An invitation to know Russia's people,"This was an unexpected gem. Russian Journal is a great read for people who love to travel or who don't travel but want to. It was less a journal and more a love letter to the people of Russia that the author met in the late 1970s. I easily could picture the harsh architecture and the warm people, what a startling contrast! I began the book wondering about Andrea's experiences (will she encounter the KGB? etc.) and by the end I was curious about her friends and wanting to go there myself. I am actually leaving in 15 months for a year long stay."
4,Gobbled it up,"While one immediately realizes that this book is a bit outdated, that does not make it less poetic and a vibrant portrait of a repressed people. This book made me fall in love with Russian culture and people, even at its darkest time Lee paints a lovely (and realistic) portrait of a country and a people. Very worth picking up!"

2,Did not fit my 2003 Honda Accord,"I bought this filter because I'm hoping it does turn out to be more economical for me. I put my car's information into Amazon to make sure this model fit my car and Amazon said it fit. I tried putting into in my car today and it was a no go. Did not even really come close. I'm sure the filter is just fine, but I had to exchange it for the right size through Amazon and Amazon is still charging me to return it because they say the reason for the exchange wasn't due to their error. I beg to differ. I'm hoping Amazon will straighten this out for me, but until then please beware."
5,Awesome Product,Installed on my 04 Accord and it fit perfect. I install K&N Filters on all my vehicles to improve power and gas mileage.
1,not what i thought,I got this but it was only the filter and not the housing for it. Does not fit well air was getting in and check engine light came on. Why does the picture show 1 thing yet i was sent another?
5,Crown of Aloes (Paperback) by Norah Lofts,Ordered for wife she loved it . Fast Shipping and in perfect condition excellent seller .Crown of Aloes (Paperback) by Norah Lofts
3,kinda crummy-but what I expected,"The product arrived quickly and was about what I expected. I'd say too much money for the product, but my son was dying for a stormtrooper outfit. I did think I had read about styrofoam parts, which sounded promising, but this thing was all polyester/plastic. No hard parts. The mask you can just toss. I think this is pretty junky. My ten-year-old likes it, though."
4,Costume,I love this costume even though it was too big for my 5 year old who weights 51 pounds and is 47 1/2 inches tall. The pants were huge. What I love though was that it was well made and came in seperate pieces an pants and a jacket.
3,So-so quality costume,The size ran large for the ages specified. The mask was the most difficult part. The holes for the eyes were too small and I had to create a way to make the mask stay on my son's face.
4,A very fun movie,"I am pretty new to Bollywood movies, and am by no means an expert. And I loved this movie. I watched with my girlfriend and 13 year old son. He did not like it all, but she loved it. We both laughed throughout the whole movie, except the end, where it got a bit more serious.This is obviously a spoof on Bollywood movies and I was left wanting to see more of them, so I could have a better idea what was being spoofed. But it was still funny, even if I did not all the jokes and inside references. (Only later did I learn that the celebration party featured the best and brightest of Bollywood cinema.)The movie did run a little long, but mostly because of the music, which we both enjoyed (and my son did not). If you are looking for a fun evening, where the fun is drawn out over three hours, I highly recommend this movie."
5,Hilarious,"As long as one understands that this movie is meant to parody every aspect of Bollywood, from the actors and directors to the dramatic music and the acting itself, this is an incredibly enjoyable movie! It is hilarious, but the plot still really involves you and you connect to the characters. Much better than American parodies! On top of this, the movie arrived days before I even expected it and in perfect shape. And for the huge fans of Shah Rukh Khan like me, the poster is worth the whole deal."
5,LOVED IT...,I really enjoy Bollywood movies and this movie was fantastic!! My daughter and I really enjoyed it and it was SO funny and goofy... Great story line.
3,A Shahrukh Khan Fans Must Have,I have really gotten into the Bollywood Scene lately and I am quickly making my way through the good and bad movies. This one is excellent. They did a bang-up jobs with the costumes for the '70s and songs (of course) entertaining. I find that dialogue is just as important to me in foreign movies. And this one hits it on the nail. This was one of the first bollywood movies I've watched and what got me hooked on Indian Cinema. I just had to own it!
1,I did not like the reincarnation topic,I was very upset with this Shah Rakh Khan movie. It was too full of false religious believes and I will throw it away!!
1,People REALLY like this movie? Why?,"OMO is a very average movie. I think Farah Khan is one of the most overblown over-hyped film maker. Actually the word film-maker doesn't describe her. This is more like an MTV movie. A lot of flash without any heart. She said she was after Shahrukh a lot to make this movie and I understand why he was playing hide and seek with her. Now don't get me wrong. The first half was very funny thanks to SRK's wit. She actually said he improvised a lot during the filming and she kept it because it was so funny. Good move sherlock. However, please don't put this movie up there with there with the greats. Lets not encourage this kind of garbage. You want to see great bollywood movies, try ""A wednesday, Chak de India, Baghban, Tarre Zameen Par, Fanna, Jab we met, Omkara, Sarkar""."
1,OM SHANTI OMG IT WAS BAD,"I have to say the plot of this movie was the worst peice of writing I have ever seen. I have watched many a Bollywood, and even the B-Movie Bollywood Calling was done 10000 times better. The sets looked good, and about 2 goodish songs. Other than that this was horrible, my friend from India said this movie was not liked in India...hey 600 million (something like that right?) people can't be wrong.The movie had such bad Bollywood acting.The plot just went aimlessly around until it would run into plot walls.OMG it was soooooooooo bad.Colorful and some catchy toons.But this film is trash."
3,Alex Bubble Beater,It doesn't crank very easy. Works better to rapidly move it through the water then it does make a lot of bubbles with a small amount of soap.
4,Bubble Beater,"My boys really enjoy this bathtub toy. I feel that the only downfall is that the ""beater paddle top"" comes off. Without the top, there is a sharp point at the end. Other than that, it is a cute bath toy."
2,Joke,"My son is 3 years old, can put together and take apart the most difficult of vacuums but can't get this bubble beater to work. I have to do it for him, and even then it doesn't do a great job. Save your money!"
1,Junk,1. Doesn't make bubbles.2. Gear stripped without much effort.3. You can make tons of bubbles for free with an empty baby powder container.
4,Not the most attractive unit ....,Seems to work as claimed. Hard to see contents from the top. Barely large enough to hold the bigger onions.
3,Just Okay...Nothing Special,"Product is okay, but it holds and retains the onion odor ... even after washing in hot, soapy water the plastic lid especially continues to smell ... even in the dish drainer you get a whiff of onion smell when nearby. Seems to protect the refrigerator from smelly onion. When not in use, though, need to keep lid attached so lid and bowl don't smell up storeage space. Have had better experience with other models keeping refrigerator odorless and container not holding onto residual smell. Like others have said product size is a bit small. Not convinced product is worth the price."
5,Had to get more!,I received one of these several years ago and absolutely love it! I bought six more for gifts. They will make perfect Christmas gifts for my neighbors who love to cook.
3,onion keeper,"Depending on how strong the onion is, I find I still need to put it in a plastic bag. It is also smaller than I would have liked."
4,Does a pretty good job,My only real complaint is that the bottom (clear) portion feels a little cheap. It is a light weight plastic - I would have preferred if it was a pyrex-like material. I am still happy with it as is.
3,The Young Duke In Color,An early Republic entry this John Wayne film is less than hour long typical of B-Western. Legend films has colorized this film but left the soundtrack alone.The colorization is not a high quality job but still better than B&W.; But the B&W; version is here anyway as well for those who hate colorization. I have news for Legend Films; the people who hate colorization won't buy this anyway so don't waste your time with B&W; version.The actual movie has an exciting stagecoach race as the finale with Yakima Cannutt and John Wayne doing excellent stunt work. Wayne totally dominates the film and although [...]Phyllis Fraser is pretty she adds nothing.The original title is Winds of the Wasteland from 1936. The DVD title really is a better title for the film.
5,this is a good one pilgrim,"loved this movie. seeing it in color was even better! great stagecoachrace. back then, they really knew how to wreck 'em. wayne is double tough. you gotta see this one."
2,Few bite size pieces left when I received it,"I thought this was a great deal when I purchased this item a few weeks ago. So far, I have opened 2 out of the 5 boxes and more than half of the cereal is crushed and not edible (unless you like it that way). I also bought the chocolate Special K cereal and the same problem so I assume it has to do with the shipping.It's a shame because the big bite size is rarely on sale like the small bite kind so I jumped on this price. Considering you are only getting half the cereal it turned out to be a bust."
3,As Advertised,"Not a very exciting cereal, but certainly a deal at the offered price if you like big bite-size sugared shredded wheat biscuits (not as attractive a mouthful as the smaller mini-wheats). Add free delivery & it's a real bargain."
4,A Victorian Era Saga of the Intrigues of the Landed Gentry,"""Dawn"" is set in an era when women were essentially without rights of property and frequently forced into marriages by domineering fathers for the purposes of amassing more property. Rider creates powerful woman who use their feminine talents to often foil the intigues and designs of men. Like all Rider novels, the characters are excellently developed and move through the elaborate plots in accordance with their described abilities. This Victorian piece with it's intrigues, lost and regained love, rich and beautiful widows, innocent maidens, a touch of witchcraft and a few spectacular dog fight scenes has the makings of a great BBC series. Like all Rider novels, ""Dawn"" is a rewarding read.Dawn"
3,"Cool socks, poor materials","I bought these for my wife. She loved them when she opened them. They really are cool! (I also bought several other pairs, also from Lin. All of the socks I bought were either large or x-large). After one or two washings (in cold water) each pair was shrunken almost small enough to fit my 3-year-old. (Yes, he has big feet, but not that big). If these didn't shrink so much, I'd very highly recommend them. If they can fix that little problem, I'd definitely buy more."
1,Dashmat Order,"I ordered a dash mat for a 2002 Dodge Dakota.. In reviewing my order, I ordered the correct year. But received 2005 to 2007 dash mat. I am in the process of returning it. This was a Christmas gift for my husband. In fear of this happening again, we will purchase it locally."
5,Love the Hampton Collection!,"Recieved most of the collection as a gift! It looks wonderful in our shared room and our son loves looking at all the little details. The collection is darling, but not too baby-ish and will grow well with our son. We have everything but the lamp, fleece blanket and wall border and look forward to completing the collection! The walls in our bedroom and bath are a light blue and we are considering using the border in the bathroom to give it a whimsical nautical theme!"
4,Robert Calvert - 'Captain Lockheed&The Firefighters (BGO),"When I heard this CD reissue for the very first time, I thought, ""what the...?"". Originally released in 1974, the purchaser SHOULD keep in mind of course that 'Captain Lockheed...' is a concept lp by Robert Calvert, who was the resident poet for Hawkwind through out the '70's. Maybe to conceptual for some. For one thing, there's plenty of dialogue. This may be so, but there are some tunes here, that truly hold the test of time. The ORIGINAL versions of ""Aerospaceage Inferno"", ""The Right Stuff"", ""Ejection"" and ""Song Of A Gremlin, Part 2"". This may not technically be a Hawkwind lp, but the players backing Calvert (R.I.P.) on this effort are: Dave Brock, Nik Turner, Lemmy, Del Dettmar and Simon King. Need I say more? A great Calvert solo title to have."
5,Frog knobs,"I adore these whimsical knobs for a bathroom that my husband and I recently remodeled. I originally saw them at a hardware store chain but they had to be special ordered anyway so I decided to check Amazon. The price was better, the delivery was very quick and the knobs are just as cute as they can be."
5,Riveting!,I had the honor of meeting Mr. Hartzell and his lovely wife. I was lucky enough to purchase one of the rare copies of his book and it is excellent. It is riveting. The book has eye witness accounts and Mr. Hartzell fills in the blanks from the view of someone that served on the NO Boat from Bremerton to Philadelphia. This is definitely a must read!
5,"Yes, yes, and YES!!! We need more poets like Anna Swir!","It's rare that a poet stirs and excites me like this one did. I first came across Swir from the wonderful poetry anthology by Czeslaw Milosz, ""A Book of Luminous Things"" where she totally captured my attention. The poetry here is always raw, direct and authentic, deeply sensual, accessible, and with none of the self-conscious mannerism or affectation that dominates the academic poetry churned out by American graduates of MFA-programs who are forever trying to get published in dreary WASPish places like The New Yorker. A large part of that is likely due to the fact of Swir having grown up in the place and time that she did, rather than in politically correct, sexually repressed suburbian/middle America."
5,It's Perfect for my Husband's Needs! *And Mine... :),"Haven't used all of the bits so far, and yes there are some extras of the most commonly used sizes. One, people lose bits all the time in renovation/housing jobs, or even just at home! Two, since they're used most often they're more prone to wear and tear, especially if it's used by someone inexperienced (*I take the blame on that one for stripping an older one by overusing it in the wrong size screwhead - I learned my lesson!), or handy for when the guy you're working with needs to 'borrow' the same bit. Great product, Hubby's happy, and I've got more of the art and shelving hung now! Thanks Amazon!"
3,Okay but do you REALLY need it??,"I purchased this box set awhile ago and it is set up to be used several different ways. You can either use it before the fall of Zhentil Keep, during the fall or after. It is not necessary to buy unless you will actually be playing in Zhentil Keep itself."
3,Good Story - Poor Sound,The story line is very good. Great Steinbeck novel but the soundquality is not very good. I had to turn the volume way up attimes in order to hear it. Very annoying.
4,East of Eden . . .,"While this is certainly the most faithful adaptation of the book, it's not as I remembered it (but then what is?). Jane Seymour really shows her stuff, but I remembered much more of her on the screen. I felt that Timothy Bottoms was not ideally cast. Certainly worth seeing but I'm not sure I would purchase it, maybe rent it."
5,East of Eden is a classic,"I love that East of Eden the mini series made it to DVD. They don't seem to make many mini series any more. Mini Series have turned into reality TV. I would like to find Rich Man Poor Man on DVD. That too is a classic that has been forgotten. East of Eden is a classic movie that fits well with the book. I read the book first many years ago, and the movies take on the book is very good. The movie fills in your imagination. Jane Seymore is a fabulous actress and could make any movie shine.If you like watching the classics which I do. You will love this movie. The remastered version looks wonderful like it is a brand new movie that has never been seen before."
1,East of Eden,The quality of this video is extremely POOR! The picture jumps throughout the entire video and it's impossible to view it. The price was low and I guess you get what you pay for. Just disappointed because I could have used that money to buy from a different seller.
1,East of Eden 1991 version,"I was very disappointed with my purchase. I paid $41.00 for this video tape and when I viewed it, the reception was distractingly snowy. Also, the voices were somewhat muffled. All in all, this purchase was a total rip-off!"
5,Want to buy movie,"I am not writing to give a review, I saw the movie years ago, but I am not able to find it anywhere. I would like to buy the movie and if at all could you tell me when you would be getting any more in stock. Or where I could get it.SincerelyTheresa McGilvery"
1,Dark movie,"I loooove historical film, especially with romantic relationships. I based my purchase on Jane Seymour, who usually plays ""romantic fluff""(no great actress). I have read Steinbeck, but not this particular book...MY FIRST MISTAKE. I can appreciate all who reviewed and their analytical reviews with several ""stars', but, if you are a romantic female stay away from this one! LOL"
5,Jane Seymour's Greatest Work!,"Since I've received my dvd, I have watched it at least 10 times. I have waited so long to see this movie again. The picture and sound quality is great and I must say I was not disappointed at all with this purchase. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"
5,Complete version on DVD,"This is an excellent adaptation of the book. Also, the DVD version is a complete, unedited version from the TV mini series. The VHS version was edited for time, and lost some farily good material in the process. Jane Seymour has never been better than she was in this series, and the actors and supporting actors are all good as well. Soon Tek Oh is especially good in his supporting role. Steinbeck makes some points to ponder about good and evil, and about the possibility that they might be inherent, yet why they really are not."
4,Excellent recreation of the great Steinbeck novel.,"I saw this movie before I had either read the book or seen the Kazan version. After reading the book and seeing the Kazan version (which follows only the last of three generations covered in the novel), I can say that this version is the most faithful to the novel in its scope and in its exploration of the full depth of Steinbeck's philosophical idea. The concept of man overcoming his sin nature passed down from father to son, from generation to generation, cannot be fully realized by covering only one generation, as the Kazan movie does. If I remember correctly, the score was taken primarily from Copeland's Appalachian Spring, which fits perfectly with the tale. There is a 4-hour version at video stores but to get the full affect, the full 6+ hour version must be seen."
1,My review for VHS East of Eden from Cinema Paradiso,"Extremely poor VHS copy of the 1981 mini-series ""East of Eden."" Paid $85.00+ expecting to get what I paid for. Cinema Paradiso advertised product to have superior picture and audio quality on Amazon.com. Picture was extremely muddy--barely watchable. During some scenes there was no audio or extremely poor audio. Have requested a full refund. Very disappointed. Have pre-ordered the DVD version of this from Amazon.com. I am looking forward to hopefully viewing an excellant digitally remastered copy."
4,The cast of East of Eden with Jane Seymour,"It is too bad that Viacom can't see fit to put this video out on DVD and refresh it. The video tape version looks like the original has deteriorated and color faded. Fantastic mini-series though, very engaging and beautiful scenery. At least one scene from the original broadcast is left out, when the Jane Seymour character is young and kills her parents by fire in the barn, because they punished her for being sexually curious."
2,Great Movie Poor Quality,"First this is a great movie. Jane Seymour is superb. The biggest problem is the very poor quality of the DVDs. The sound is poor, many scenes are dark and blurry. It gives me the feel that the master used to make the DVD was a VHS tape."
5,AMAZING BOOK!!,"This book is fantastic - gives you all the details from when babies are just a mear thought, to when the real little munchkin is in your arms... All the details you don't normal hear about when speaking with doctors etc. This is a womans real life account of her own experiences and what she went through - it's so easy to read you feel as if you are sitting there with a friend chatting for hours.Well worth the purchase - it provides you with contacts/groups/places to go all listed at the back - it would be great if I could find a book like this for a lesbian mother to be in Australia. AMAZING BOOK!!! THANK YOU!!"
5,Five Little Peppers And How They Grew,"This book takes place in the the 1930's, during The Great Depression. It is sort of dated, but the story line is still an excellent one. In it, the father has gone and Mrs. Pepper and her five children have to learn to get on in life without all the easy things. Later, they meet with a boy named Jasper, and between Jasper and a host of various other people, to make a happy ending for the Peppers. There is an afterward by Betsy Byars."
5,Dorcas' Review,Margaret Sidney wrote a great series about The Five Little Peppers. It is an excellent series of books. Five Little Peppers and How They Grew shows how these children grew up learning how to be moral and obedient how people. I think all families should have this series in their families.
5,Just as good as i remembered,This book has been a favorite of mine since I was a small girl. I read it many timer as I grew up. Also I read it to my children.
3,A book I remember adoring in my childhood,"The Peppers are horribly poor, too poor for the children to go to school, too poor to celebrate Christmas, too poor to even buy an envelope to mail a letter in. Then the Peppers meet Jasper and their lives do a complete turnaround.A surprisingly happy story. Cheery, even. Not sure what modern children would think about this one...."
1,Poor quality,"Whoever edited this edition, should be fired. There were repeat sections, too many typos. I wonder if this was a scanned a digitally reproduced book with no content checking? Also, the [...] URL referenced on the back cover doesn't exist as I discovered when I tried to go there to find out why this edition of the book was such crap. Do yourself a favor and try to find a different edition if you want to own The Five Little Peppers and How They Grew."
5,wonderful old fashioned book,There is a sweetness about this book that is missing in many modern children's books. It emphasizes the good character the children are developing as they struggle with challenges. It is very satisfying in the end too!
4,Latest edition of a virtual glass collectibles encyclopedia,"This is the 3rd edition of the most comprehensive guide to glass collectibles. Contains a huge amount of information covering thousands of entries with prices. All major types of glass items are included along with a brief history of major manufacturers. Hundreds of items are shown in black and white photos. References, web sites, auction houses and reproduction alerts add to the book's value. An important addition to every glass collector's library."
5,Maggie Sweet the novel,"Judith Minthorn Stacy, the author of ""Maggie Sweet"", lives in my hometown of Mooresville, North Carolina. How thrilled I was to find ""Maggie Sweet"" at the library in Myrtle Beach, S.C. I read the book from cover to cover in one sitting and have told so many friends about it. You have to be from the South to really appreciate the dialect of Ms. Stacy. I could not find""Betty Sweet tells all"" anywhere. I ordered from ""BordeeBooks"" and it was just as wonderful as ""Maggie Sweet"". I cannot wait until Ms. Stacy writes another book, she is a wonderful author."
4,southern as bluebell icecream,"The book is short and ""sweet"" but definitely a fun read. While ""Maggie Sweet"" will never be confused with Southern literature such as Faulkner, or even Lee Smith, Stacy does an excellent job with making us laugh and earning our sympathy by the third chapter. Fans of Fannie Flagg and Adriana Trigiani will love this book. Maggie is a ""desperate housewife"" of a sort, and her struggle to have her childhood dreams is what propels this story along. With the obvious cliches scattered through the whole book,this is forgivable and you won't be disappointed. The characters are like those in your own community. If this book is intended to be the first of a series, it is a striking and stirring beginning. Funny, memorable, and unpretentious."
1,Maggie Sweet,"With most events happening coincidentally, I found this book extremely predictable. Almost all of the characters possessed extreme personalities and therefore, were written over-the-top and unrealistic. Everybody lives happily ever after....? yeah, right. And no mention of Amy at the graduation party, etc. --- what happened to her? Besides, there was a typographical error on the last page, and typos bug me. I finished this book, because I had already invested the time, but I was sorry I did."
1,Book needs to be taken into Style Salon and gussied up!,"This book won the NC new writers award and recently got picked up by a major publisher. What in the world were they thinking? In the afternoon it took to read, I was overwhelmed with how insipid it was. Weak storyline and the plot was predictable. There's hope for all would-be writers to be picked up by a publisher after reading this book. Would NOT recommend it to anyone."
1,Big Ol' Letdown,"I started this book thinking it was gonna be good, campy Southern fun. Instead I got a lame, predictable plot that wasn't even up to snuff for a Lifetime movie script. Stay away from this book if you have even a scintilla of intelligience and/or a fondness for Southern fiction."
2,Not as good as I expected,"It was kind of funny, but it was predictable and just not what I was looking for."
3,Light but entertaining,"I went into this book ""blind"" (I had never heard anything about it and had only glanced at the synopsis on the back cover). I must say that I was entertained and, although the book often headed down a cliche road, it always seemed to redeem itself. There are some stock characters, but Maggie Sweet is a one of a kind woman."
3,Worth Reading...,"Opinions: Bought this book used, and it was pretty beat up when it arrived. However, the book itself has something to offer.It is written in an easy to read style, and while it gives some good advice, the main premise is pretty basic: Stop running from fear. Running doesn't work, running hasn't worked, running won't work. Ultimately, all you do by dodging or denying uncomfortable emotions is make them more potent and scary the next time around...and there WILL be a next time.If you struggle with worry and fear, you may well want to consider this book. This is no magic cure-all by any stretch, but it does take a somewhat different look at fear."
1,No need to read this book,"Not only did the author write his own review, he used a ""vanity"" publisher."
1,200 pages?,"Seriously, the author writes his own review. He doesn't even have one or two family or friends who could give it 5 stars? Just him? How could he possibly have filled 200 pages? Why doesn't everyone just save a tree and not order this book."
5,Nice player,"Just got the player before a flight. I have to say this player doesn't dissapoint. It has a fantastic picture but only so so sound from the speakers (expected for its speaker size). Headphones on the otherhand sound great. It's loud enough even when sitting next to the planes engine. It has a lot of great features including progressive scan component video output if you have a TV that can handle it. Battery size is larger than I would like (my only beef) but has good run down time. Some have complained about battery discharge when the unit is off and TV connections not working. I say READ THE MANUAL! The manual clearly states that you should disconnect the battery when not in use. This is because the unit still requires a small amount of power when it is off. This is so you can use the remote to turn the unit on. As for the video connections, you have to use the monitor button to get video out. This player is definitely worth the price."
5,Awesome DVD player,"After researching portable dvd players extensively, I finally bought these and I can't complain ONE bit. I was deciding between the Sonys, Panasonics and Toshibas and while they are all very similiar in picture quality I felt Toshiba was the best for features, reviews and price. The picture is really amazing and while the speakers are a bit lacking, that is true for the majority of portable dvd players. The only problem I've had is that it states that it plays video cd's but so far I have not been able to play any of them. The battery life is outstanding. The manual says it's good for 3.5 hours but I used them for almost 4.5 hours. I watched mystic river and (6) 25 minute episodes of the simpsons. Overall, I highly recommend this player."
2,"Great Picture, No Sound","This DVD player has a wonderful picture but without using some kind of head phones, the sound is almost faint. I've heard others and the sound on both Toshiba Portable DVD's (the 8 and 9 inch) is very low and ""tinny"" even when turned up to the highest volume, you can barely hear it. It's a shame because the picture is beautiful."
2,Let Down,"It could be a good unit but:1) As others mentioned with the normal sound setting, the volume is way too low, even for headphones. And with headphones attached, there is a very loud background noise (hiss) generated by the on-board speakers.2) I also noticed (at least in the unit I had) that the sound mix was heavy towards the left channel, i.e. the center sounds were not exactly center. I tested this with many DVDs and had the same bad result. Annoying.3) The battery is way too bulky for a portable. All these companies should show their units with the battery pack as well before you buy them. The Panasonic models have such a smaller profile.4) Even with all the good on-paper video specs I found the picture not as warm. Again, I think the Panasonics imho seem better.So, I think I'll be returning mine and taking a look at the Panasonice DVD-LA95 instead."
2,A fine but quiet performer,"This player is loaded with wonderful features. Picture quality is good, being the largest one I've auditioned. There are many helpful features for viewing chapters, segments of chapters, etc. Regretfully, I had to return the one I ordered. Compared to the other players I've tried, the speaker volume was very low and contained no middle or low frequency output. It was like listening to just the tweeter's output. The headphone output however had pleanty of volume with full tonal range. Hopefully this was just a defective unit and not indicative of all SD-P2000's."
2,Disappointing sound makes unit unuseable ...,I would agree that this is by far the best unit on the market. Superior picture quality is important and not even the newest Samsung unit beats the Toshiba. But sound quality is also important to a movie and Toshiba fails miserably here. Low volume at the highest setting makes the unit unuseable on aircraft or in other noisy enviornments. It is going back.
1,great portable useless for tv usage,"I tried this player and was impressed with the quality of the picture. the sound was ok for a player this size. what I did not like was the a/v output did not work. I.E. you cant hook it up with the cable supplied.I tried 2 machines both would not play on a standard TV. so, if you only want to watch the little screen attached to it this machine is awesome, but forget hooking it up to a motel TV or anywhere else!"
5,A book that's a friend,You know when it's nice to hear when someone else is going through what you are going through? This book is just that. It helps you to know that you're not ever alone because God has always been there.
3,Dance of Daze...,"Growing up in Milwaukee, skateboarding and listening to punk rock, the D.C. Hardcore music scene had a huge impact on me. Instilling beliefs and values I still hold on to today.Upon receiving the book, I was highly disappointed. Not in its editorial content, but the layout and design. I mean, this thing is layed out like a scholastic textbook.One of the reasons I got into punk/hardcore music was to avoid boring things like school textbooks... oh well, it just wasn't for me."
2,Misquoted,I give it two stars for a great concept but I have a few issues with it since it is suppose to be non-fiction. The 1st being that someone I know was was misquoted in it which makes me wonder how many other people people were misquoted as well. Also I would disagree with some the character descriptions and affiliations given to a few of the people.
3,History of D.C. Punk is not over.,"This is what Ian Mackaye of Fugazi had to say about this book when asked by Slug magazine if he had read this book.""IAN: I have not read it. I don't read books about myself. I was there, and I know what happened. They [the people that wrote the book] were not there. They're my friends. I know they had a big job ahead of them, but they were not there, so they couldn't possibly know what really happened. It would be depressing to read my own history and not have it be accurate. It's just weird. I just avoid those things. Another thing is that they are history books, and history is about what has been done. I am not done. I am doing. I'm not there yet. I've got too much work to do."""
2,Pure Posturing,"Anyone who goes to a Fugazi show (in DC) knows that the first 5 minutes of it are going to be taken up by Mark Anderson passing off bumper-sticker quotes as deep political lecturing and flogging for ""Positive Force"", which may be doing some good for the community, but has surely cramped the musical scene. He's insufferable. If you haven't had the misfortune of seeing him live, you can read his book which is a couple hundred pages of political posturing dressed up as the history of DC punk. The book is nothing more than unrelenting praise of Fugazi and self-serious [junk] about politics. Worse than being inane, Anderson's politics are BORING. No one cares, guy. DC - and the country - are doing better than ever no thanks to his and his friends luddite and reactionary (dressed up as ""progressive"") politics."
2,A letdown but bought it since it's about harDCore,"I suspect most people bought this book just because it is about Dischord and the DC scene, and we like the idea of a cool looking book format about the scene. But this book is, overall, a letdown.Like the author himself, this book is a bit of a bore that seems to glorify certain things without driving a sense of vitality at all. The details can be cool but often times are tedious and painful to read. Let's face it-- no one from outside the scene would find this book tolerable at all.I am not going to debate what bands were/weren't included. I just found the book to be long and, ultimately, slightly a downer. Disappointing. Steal it from a friend then give it back-- you'll see."
5,Essential Reading for DC Hardcore fans,"This books is crucial for fans of the DC scene and all of the people and bands involved with Dischord Records. Reading this book I learned about the context in which the lyrics of those bands were written. This book is like the glue that pulls all of the DC puzzle pieces together. NOW I understand the situations that gave birth to the way so many of those people were thinking. This book clears up a lot of mysteries for me. Seriously, I had a hard time stopping once I started reading. I can't recommend this book enough for people who are true fans of all things Dischord. The authors did an amazing job pulling all the pieces together. I'm so happy that I got this book."
1,A book that distorts the whole truth of somali women,"Not a good start for anyone working with Somali people as the book distorts the whole truth of how Somalis treat ""their"" women.This was a girl who at her young age, fell in love with an Italian boy and slept with many different men mostly Italian settlers while roaming around Mogadishu's red lights. The book does not give even a bird's eye view point of what life a Somali woman has in Somalia and the way she is treated in her community. Readers should consult with more other books or observe the Somali community in their country."
3,Aman Review From Oshawa Ont,"I had just finished reading this book. I found it very interesting but a little long and drawn out. However,I recommend this book to those who need to do a women Study for a project or a term paper. I bought this book for 5$ in a used book store."
3,Bought the book. It was ok,The book was ok. It is helpful to those who has no business experience what so ever. I will not help you at all if you are already experienced with the business world. Basically teaches you to have a vision and constantly motivate your people. Join a MLM if you want to learn it first hand.
4,Important Messages Said Simply,"Books about vision and mission are usually excursions into the ether of fine thoughts and noble thinking. I appreciated how Boylan reduced these concepts to very practical concerns and actions that once expressed will get an organization effectively pointed in the same direction. This is a book I recommend to anyone who needs to get an organization from here to there, when the group is unclear about which ""here"" and which ""there"" is intended."
4,Pretty Great,"I got this used for 99 dollars at guitar center but I wanted to review it here.Pros:Anyone who's familiar with the band 'Animal Collective' (Strawberry Jamlisten to the song #1) this is the pedal for you.My main reason I got this pedal was when I go to play a show a lot of the time the sound guys never get my vocals the way I want them too. Not anymore.It's made of metal, so it seems pretty sturdy. Also, the tube pre-amp sim in this makes your voice sound about 10x warmer.Cons:This thing feedbacks like a mother. Don't be afraid to learn how to use the noise gate, and please make presets so your settings don't get lost.Headphone port seems kind of movable, which it shouldn't.So basically, if you want a less expensive way to get your vocals the way you want them too for a show, go for this."
2,A Recording Studio Engineer,"The effects will work well for someone in a live band, but if you are looking for a device to record with in a studio, you may want to look at the ""Digi Tech Live Vocalist 3""."
3,Power Supply Shorted out within days,"The Unit is great the only problem I have had is that The Power Supply Shorted out very quick, this thing doesn't take batters and Multi Power supplys and a 1 spot wont work with these So once your power supply screws up you have a $200 Brick...But other than that it was fun while it lasted"
2,Not great for serious musicians,"This processor does have a lot of good basics, like a pre-amp for a warmer tone, distortion, reverb and delay, but 90% of the effects a singer would never need. Lots of robotic, sci-fi effects that are fun if you are messing around in your garage but that you would never use in a live setting. At a low volume the quality is fine but when I turned up my PA at all i got a high pitched hiss that I could not find a way to get rid of (even when is bypass mode). An ok processor, but for the price, I'd rather have something with a harmonizer and autotune, which this unit does not have."
5,Great product @ a great price.,This effects processor is great. I also use it with my guitar. It's like having 40 pedals in one.
1,Entertaining but limited,"The book is easy to read. It does not have a lot of insider knowledge of Japan, and the conclusions sound contrived."
2,Why so many factual errors,"I found this to be an interesting book, possibly more useful to someone not too well acquainted with Japan. BUT how can a book like this be published with so many factual errors? The Princess is not Masaka, but Masako. Nagano is not 100 miles from Tokyo, Tokyo is not the largest city in the world, Takasaki is not 200 miles from Tokyo, Ishihara did not get 319 million votes, etc. If these kind of errors are allowed in a book, how accurate is some of the other information? Rather disappointing."
5,What do they believe?,"A concise yet comprehensive look at the major cults that doesn't require a degree in theology! Something every Christian should have on their bookshelf. Examines each cult briefly under nine doctrinal headings, and includes each one's ""speciality"" and history. Also briefly reviews basic Christian doctrine and shows you how to ""test"" teaching according to Biblical standards. A ""must have"". Great for Bible Studies and teaching sessions too."
2,Outdated series of advertisements,"This book is little more than a series of plugs from biotech firms trying to sell their technologies. It's seriously outdated anyway, so don't bother."
1,Bad Quality,"I purchased this watch from a department store a little over a year ago and less than a month goes by and the watch stops working...the watch gets more and more behind. Thinking it's the battery I bought a new battery but still the watch didn't work right. So I returned it to the store for a new one. The new one worked for just under a year and then began to lose time. Thinking again that it was the battery, I replaced that again and a few days later it was 45 minutes slow again. The company says they will fix it but I have to pay for all the shipping charges. I'm not too happy with that (for one, I live overseas and they won't return the watch to me overseas) since it is the fault of their defective product. I've owned only two fossil watches (this one, twice) and they have both been defective. I would hesitate to buy a Fossil watch now even though I previously heard good things about them."
3,Lots of highlinghting,This product contained a lot of markings with a highlighter that was not stated in the book's condition status.
1,rambling....,"Slow... very slow. Also F*** is interspersed through out the dialogue. ""Daily"" life of 3rd rate musicians made into vampires to sell a book."
5,The Best book Ever!!!!!!!!!!.,The Book I Chose was Rotten school The bigbluebarf. I Likes it because they started a food fight because a new kid likes this new girl and he gets jesious also because of a new watch.that he as peter as two slaves this is why I like it because of The charariters and pictures.
5,Amish made wrought iron robe/towel hooks,"I am in love with this company and the very high quality of their products. The first thing I bought was the towel ring, which I did review. I went on to buy two more of those. Then I bought the robe/towel hooks. I will review the tissue holder under that category later (also superb).All of these articles are substantial. If you have kids, you will really appreciate them. That goes for teenagers too. These are strong, simple and take up no room. They look great on the wall in our Tudor house, but are also a wonderful cottage style addition.Definitely buy .... good prices too!"
4,Very useful,"Although some of my questions went unanswered, this book is helpful for most citings and contains a lot of useful information."
3,"Skips around, a lot of searching","I bought this in order to avoid plagiarism on papers.Likes*Very thorough*Uses examplesDislikes*Very scattered, any exception in a citation requires going to an entirely different chapter, which makes it possible to miss that part of the citation."
4,Thorough Resource for MLA style,"A must have for technical writing, this handbook is a resource that should be at hand for anyone writing for or about research."
3,Know which edition you need...,"The 6th edition of this handbook is very handy, if it's what you need for your work. The 7th edition was released in 2009, so there are several updated standards and rules. Check which edition your professor/teacher/institution is going by, and purchase accordingly."
5,"MLA Handbook for writers of Research Papers, sixth editions",An excellent overall guide for writing research papers. I highly recommend this product for all college and college-bound students. What a remarkable way to display and work with the English Language.
2,don't think you need it? don't buy it!,"This book is hard to find things in and doesn't seem extremely well-organized. Besides that, it's annoying because it looks like it was done on an old school typewriter. I thought I'd need it because I need to write a lot of papers for my classes, but it turns out I can just look in the journals I'm using for the citation style for the most part."
4,good shape,"Lots of help, very useful, but when i got it, the silver cover was a bit dirty, and the stain would not come of, other than that, excellent handbook."
5,pleased with purchase,Book was just as described and I am very happy with it. met my needs for school.
5,MLA handbooks super,I was very satisfied with the mla handbooks. The shipping and handling was superb. Thanks a million.
5,The General Handbook on Writing.,"The MLA Handbook is THE handbook used for writing in high school and colleges across the United States. The APA handbook comes in 2nd place, but it can't stand up to the MLA Handbook. English teachers across the country swear by it, and despite what people might think, English teachers do have a great deal of clout when it comes to writing with the mass populace. There have been a few minor changes that the MLA has made since publishing this edition. Nevertheless, this is the latest edition and until edition 7 comes around, this will be the handbook on writing and researching that tons of students across the country will become familiar. A good resource."
2,Not convenient -- poor organization,"As an English Lit. major in college a MLA Handbook is indispensible, but I was disappointed with this one. I found it difficult to locate the information I needed, often having to comb several pages to find what I was looking for. It is just not convenient to use. I much prefer Diana Hacker's ""A Writer's Reference."" The layout of her book is much simpler to navigate, and the spiral binding is always a plus, because it lays open on your desk nicely."
4,thank god they updated it!,"After staring at the 5th edition through a 4 year B.A., and continuing to refer to it into my graduate degree, I am SO glad they put out a new edition with an update on citing the internet. Hopefully they will have updated some of the other things that are missing for university students who want to work beyond a basic level research paper. Definitely worth keeping within reach if you have to write any Humanities paper"
2,Overly complicated,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the other reviewers. I had such high hopes of getting a true insight into how a large enterprise scale application is made in the real world.Sadly, I was totally lost after the first 50 pages and found the rest of the book far to much effort to continue with.These guys are obviously very clever, but they sorely need to look at some of the classic books such as the Gang of Four or Martin Fowlers book to get an idea of how to make difficult topics readable"
2,Incomplete dissection,"This book isn't big enough to cover the full dissection of the SharpDevelop application. As a result, the code snippets are confusing. Also, the authors write too much on XML Config files, and tell the reader to look at the source code for how the config files are used."
1,"BEWARE-""Neighborhood Ball"" incomplete--.NOOO Shakira!","This is not the broadcast of ""The Neighborhood Ball"" that was shown on ABC. The great performance by Shakira has been cut, the dj has been cut, the backstage interview with Obama has been cut."
5,We Are One concert and Presidential Inauguration neighborhood ball,"I was quite satisfied with the product. I really wanted the concert right after it was televised, but was unavailable until now. While I have not viewed the neighborhood ball or the President's Inaugural Address on disc 2, the concert is on disc 1 in its entirety. Great Concert!"
1,Bad learning book,This is a very poor teaching book. The author fails miserably in trying to give the first timer a solid picture of what is happening. Feels more like blob of jello. I think that this book should not be used as an intro textbook. Its also wasting my strength to carry it to class.
3,Old Fashioned,A new editon is due soon - hope it's better. The main difficulty is that this book presents material but doesn't give much insight. Many of the problems extend the material in the text in nonobvious ways - a bit challenging for the reader. And the use of PSpice is terribly dull - used only to verify hand analysis.
2,"Some good, some bad in hindsight","I used an earlier version of this book as an undergrad. I am happy with the experience and the knowledge I gained of the theoretical underpinnings of electronics. On the other hand, it never really helped me take the next step in using or applying the information. I kept the book as it was one I felt would help me long term and I liked it, but once working in electonics, I find it really wasn't useful. Most of the problems I see on a day to day basis were never addressed and the methods I learned in graduate level classes were much more powerful.I do wish more students had the underlying knowledge of electonics, so many engineers these days don't know why or how semiconductors work!The way I saw the book is that it teaches one how to drive a car by exlaining the gas pedal, the engine, the transmission, the tires, and the road. Great to know, but it never gets around to clearly saying why something is the way it is or clearly summarizing the important points."
2,good....not great,I had to get it for a class but i wouldn't get it on my own. The book lacks explainations and examples that would normaly be expected in this level of a book.
2,Poor explanations and difficult to follow,"Examples are too simple to form a good understanding of the material, and to tackle the more difficult end of chapter problems. Explanations are poor to fair at best."
1,"Lots of worthless examples, but few words.","This book has a lot of examples which I felt was going to help with the course, however; the written part of the book is dim. The text never really tells you what is going on which leaves a lot to be learned and a higher stress level in an introductory engineering class. This book would be a fine text for a more advanced course."
1,At least get the examples right,"On average, there are 5 errors per chapter in this book. The examples given often use wrong units. The equations often mix current for voltage. This book has one use: it adheres to the common stereoype that electrical engineers can't write."
2,a good reference text but not good for intro course,"this book is thick and covers a lot of topics quite in-depth, definitely not very good book to start with on microelectronics, but it does make a good ref text!"
2,Not for a beginner,"This book is written with the big assumption that the reader is quite versed in the topic already and is very sophisticated in math manipulations to get the results that Sedra ends up with !Well for a beginner student intersted in this topic this is a book that he or she would struggle with for sure!But this is the common problem with tech writers who use information and formulas that they never first explain and then assume the reader already knows the material being presented. This is why tech writers rarely get the Pulitzer Prize in writing !Could Sedra correct this flaw ?Sure, but often these authors are so set in their ways that it is a struggle even to bring it up to them, so the only answer to new students in the field is to keep searhing for texts that do meet the student half way at least.Gerard J Sagliocca, P.E.gerard_sagliocca@yahoo.com"
1,The Worst,"This is by far the worst book I have had the displeasure to read. The first problem is the incomplete examples. On page 128 the author claims that 10/10 = 1mA. In my book that is 1. The examples are only the begining of the problems with this book. The CD that came with the book (at least mine did) is filled with the exact pages from the book. How does this help anyone. Every person that has read the book (Including the teacher who teaches the couse) agrees, Never ever by this book if you want to learn electronics."
2,Not clearly written.,"I found this text terribly unclear. It was obviously written by professors who forgot their audience is comprised of E.E. STUDENTS (whom this is their first exposure to such material). Also, the CD rom (included) and highly-touted author web site are juvenile and worthless- obviously introduced just to say ""Hey, our text comes with a CD rom and supporting web site!"" The authors could greatly improve their book by using a ""back-to-basics"" approach. Sit down with students trying to learn the material for the first time, and revise accordingly."
1,Hopelessly poor book.,"People, you really think this is a good teaching text? This book has many mistakes for its chapter question solutions. Important concepts are stated subtly and expected to be instantly understood and absorbed by the reader. Before issuing any future editions, the authors should really consider taking some technical writing classes to improve their communication skills."
2,I don't like this book,"Perhaps this book is good for circuit designers, because although I absolutely despise this book, seems like many well qualified people like it. I am not a circuits person (electromagnetics/physics is my field) and I find this book a poor reference. I got absolutely nothing out of this book, so in my opinion, if you are from a field other than micro circuit design, you'd most likely want some other reference book."
1,I would of chosen the 0 star option instead if it was there,"This is one of the worst circuits books I have ever encountered. The examples don't explain much, the questions asked at the end of each chapter don't match the examples, the topics are all over the place and don't have much relationship with one another, the explainations are poor and incoherent... Many important concepts are left untaught and expected from the student when doing exercises. My fellow electrical engineers, if your circuits class happen to use this book. I pity you. May God have mercy on us all for having to go through a semester with this book. Amen"
