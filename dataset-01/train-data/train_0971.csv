2,a bit shocking and I am not a prude,"Ok, so Anne Rice is a great writer, yet this book and I would assume the two following, is just vile, in my opinion. I have read many of her novels and am a great fan, yet Beauty is just too much for me. I immediately saw where 50 Shades has taken her ideas and turned them into a modern day story (personally I would have been a bit upset by this) even the lip biting habit. All and all, the attraction to the story of love and lust with the trilogy in 50 was addicting. This book, so sorry Anne, is nothing more than raw, graphic, repetitive pure vile acts of animalistic sex. I found no tenderness acts of love or romance in it at all. To be sexy and capture the mind (which is part of seducing one) it takes more than the acts of dominance and rape. I wish I had stuck with 50 shades lingering in my mind.....I would still be romancing the ideas of Christian and Anastasia. I hope this book leaves my head and soon."
1,very disappointing,Did not like this book at all. I don't get it and the ending is......... What a waste of 12.99 save your money. I thought that this would have been a love story.
2,this is just really badly written erotica,"can't Anne Rice use the english language any better than this? (maybe she's better in her other books) this book just comes off as really badly written smut! Unless you have never ever imagined or been exposed to the concept of S&M or D/s, every scene in this story is completely predictable and repetitive. But, if you've read any other D/s fiction, i would bet that whatever you've read before is probably much more erotic than this. I can't even put this book in the hard core erotica category, 'cause there's books that are much more hardcore than this. And if you're looking for softcore erotica, the writing in here is definitely not subtle or eloquent enough to qualify. A suggestion for those who might be willing to read something SciFi-oriented that portrays a similar world of Domination/submission: _Captive of Gor_, _Slave Girl of Gor_, and _Dancer of Gor_ all by John Norman."
1,NOT 50 shades,I bought this book thinking it would be decent and like 50 shades. It turns out this book is incredibly disgusting and digrading. DO NOT buy this if you're looking for romance. This is not the book for you.
1,Can I give it 0 stars??? NOTHING like 50 shades!,"I thought this would be like 50 Shades and it is SO not! Awful, disturbing, violent, horrible, not my cup of tea whatsoever. I suppose if you are into that kind of thing, you may find it interesting but I couldn't bear to read another word, made it to about chapter 7. No Way, Not For Me!"
1,How did this make the NY Best Sellers List?!,"This book was painful to read, I read it in 2 days just so I could finish it and start a new book. It is extremely dark and caught myself disgusted at times and skimming through certain parts. If you like reading about sodomy and rape this is the book for you otherwise it is a very sick and twisted version of Sleeping Beauty that I can't understand anyone liking."
1,"Nope, nope, nope","After slogging through the mire that is ""50 Shades of Grey,"" I decided to download the sample of this relatively well-reviewed book by Anne Rice. I'm glad I didn't actually purchase the book--all I could think of was Lord Farquaad and Fiona from Shrek...not exactly the erotic imagery I had in mind. Skip it."
3,Interesting,"I value Rice's recrafting of a treasured faerietale as an adult fantasy. At the time this was published, it was a brave foray creating erotica as a more mainstream art form. I found myself skipping the sex to get back to the plot, however."
2,Not your typical fairy tale,"I bought these books expecting some romance, what i didn't expect was all the abuse that Beauty deals with. All of the spanking and sexual torture just really turned me off. I can not see how anyone would except being treated like this. Maybe that's why i can not get into the BDSM lifestyle. I have read other BDSM books after Rice's Beauty trilogy and i found that i liked them a whole lot more than her books.And i also hated the fact that Beauty was just this mindless sex addict who went from man to man and the Prince at the beginning of the first book was barely in the story. She loved him and then quickly went onto another man and loved him, then went to another one. I know its just a story but i just hated Beauty by the end of the books. I read most of the first book, and i skimmed the other two. I was not happy with the ending, very disappointed."
3,Not as bad as as I was,"My friends warned me away from this book with the following: ""nothing but spanking"" or ""nothing but femsub"". Both are incorrect. There is more than spanking though that does dominate the book especially early on. As for pairings, they are all over the place as long as the Prince's kingdom is the one in the dominant position. However the sex and kink scenes are almost non-stop which really didn't allow me to develop much empathy for any character. After a while I just stopped caring about what was happening and to whom."
3,"Not a work of art, but pretty entertaining.","All right, this is no literary masterpiece, but i guiltily admit to enjoying it. Though it is only the first book of a trilogy, i think it is enjoyable by itself and left me feeling fulfilled, meaning there was closure, and you don't really have to read the others (which i started and got bored with). This book is completely erotic and enjoyable basically just for the hot sex scenes. Make sure you have a man/woman near you when you read because, trust me, you'll need some contact after reading some of these pages. I lent it to my brother in law who took it with him when he was shipped overseas and he said it has circulated throughout the entire unit...."
5,Good read,The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty was a good book. I like Anne Rice books. I will look for more from she.
4,Crazy,"I thought over all this book was good. It is the first book I've read by Anne Rice. It was very erotic but also very harsh. I was horrified by the torture. I know if I were a character in this book it would have killed someone to save my life. But, I could not put the book down only because I wanted to see what on earth Beauty would do. I am a big fan of romance novels and there is no romance at all. Just pure sex and torture. I don't think there is even a real plot to this story. But, like I said, I simply couldn't put the book down."
5,What I was looking for,The book was in great condition and matched the other two volumes I already owned.
2,ummmmm . . . what?,"I'm a huge fan of Anne Rice and all, and I am really into erotica, so I thought that this would be a great book. Boy, was I really disappointed. Oh, the book had its moments, but there were so many spankings and it just got redundant. The first couple of punishments were kind of exciting and that got me thinking, ""cool, now we're going to get to the actual sex!"" But it wasn't to be. No, instead it was just spanking after spanking after spanking after . . ."
3,"It's OK, and I thought I was purchasing the whole trilogy for 12.99, but not","It's an OK book. I thought I was buying the trilogy for 12.99 Kindle version. I would not have paid 12.99 for just one, so probably not going to buy the other 2."
5,Definitely entertaining!,"This book is amazing.However, if you are looking for the classic fairy tale, turn aroun and pick something else to read.If you are looking for something to make your mind boost with erotic estimulation, you chose the right book."
4,Not what you expect...,"No, not at all what you expect, much much more. The thrilling and arousing plights of Beauty as you live them along with her. She has a way to always bring you into her novels."
1,"WOW, this was crap!","I bought this book because I have an interest in S&M... but it was SO repetitive and utterly boring that just finishing it was an amazing feat! The very fact that ""Beauty"" could be Soooo shocked at her predicaments, even though it was basically the same tedious, unimaginative torture page after page, became quite a joke to me. The book starts out nicely but quickly becomes one long Y-A-W-N .... You might as well put it down after the first few chapters, because believe me, at that point ... you HAVE read it all. Save your money and try reading some erotica with a little imagination, intrigue, and a plot . like ""Topping From Below"""
2,Should be called the spanking of sleeping beauty,"As a long time fan of Anne Rice's witch books I started this book with high expectations. Instead I found myself skimming the long descriptions of spanking, welted bottoms, paddles etc. As a result I skimmed most of the book. This book was just too boring to justify buying the other 2. They really shouldn't classify this as erotica because there was very little ""sexy stuff"". I'm glad I bought it used, I would have been irritated if I paid full price for it."
3,S&M is not just my stuff,"I expected, based on my reading previous reviews, that the book would be steaming with sex. But I at least expected that there would be a sensible plot & some depth. I was disappointed to learn that there was nothing more but spanking, paddling & whipping. It was just too twisted to enjoy such a thing. Other readers mentioned that there was a great characterization & depth but I personally feel that that the characters were bare & void & they were just like their pornographic counterparts.I have to admit that there were parts which turned me on - but the incessant paddling was a great turn-off!"
2,Kinda boring,It seems like all the characters can do is spank each other. I've never really cared for the way Rice writes but at least she has produced stores in the past. I don't see any point to this - waste of money.
1,"Unless you enjoy reading about excessive spanking & humiliation, don't bother","I really expected more from this book based on the positive reviews I read. I am very open minded when it comes sexuality, but what I found in this book here was more humilation and spanking than anything else.As stated by other reviewers, some of what is written as punishment would indeed injure, maim or kill a person. Not to mention the techniques used to attract flies and other insects to a person's nether regions.... ugh!The story just drones on and on and to me is just not enticing at all.Give me some good BDSM on fanfiction over this anytime."
1,Immensely horrible.,"I never thought that Anne Rice could disappoint.Turns out she can.I bought this book figuring a little fairytale erotica would be good, however this book has no plotline, the characters are undeveloped at best and there's nothing erotic about being spanked that many times.Don't waste your money on this. I'm sorry I did."
1,Not what I expected,"Having read Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles (both old and new) I figured I would give this a shot too. After all, it's the same author, the books should be similar, right? I was horribly disappointed.There is no plot to speak of, just spankings on top of spankings. The relationships have no depth. Neither do the characters.I found the Vampire Chronicles to be more erotic than The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty because the scenes in The Vampire Chronicles were called for and needed to advance the story. In The Claiming of Beauty, the scenes serve no purpose, and there are a lot of them.I would advise all Anne Rice fans to skip this trilogy. Otherwise you are going to be in for major disappointment. I know that I personally, am not going to read the remainder of the trilogy."
1,Disturbing,I actually am a fan of Rice's Vampire Chronicles. But even just reading the first few pages of this book and skimming the rest was enough to leave me feeling disturbed for several days. I wouldn't reccomend reading this book unless you have a strong stomach for things such as rape and sexual torture.
4,Highly Enjoyable,"I wasn't surprised to see so many negative reviews about this book. It's not for everyone, by any means. Still, I thought the trilogy was great. There's not enough well-written BDSM literature out there, and to get three whole books of it was fantastic. I've read these over and over. Recommended for anyone who's curious about the darker side of erotica."
2,The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty,"After being sorely disappointed with Fifty Shades of Grey, I was told I should try this trilogy. I did some research and decided to give it a whirl. But I was definitely not prepared for what was in store for me from Ms. Rice. Now I'm no rookie when it comes to romance novels, but The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty gave new meaning to sex scenes... if you can even call them that. There were moments where they were more likely to be considered rape than consensual sex and left me feeling uncomfortable.You can read the rest of my review for this book on my blog, Reading Until I Fall Asleep:[...]"
3,A little too much,"I decided to read this after reading 50 Shades of Grey. At first I could not put it down but after a while you become desensitized to the whipping and the naked and the beatings. I really liked the concept of the story (what happens when Sleeping Beauty wakes up). My biggest problem with it is since it's a Trilogy you have to read the next book to see what happens. I know that sounds weird but other series books I have read (50 Shades, Twilight, Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings) can stand up on their own as a book or a series."
4,The claiming of sleeping beauty,Although this book takes you to some very strange acts in the sexual realm - it pushes you to examine your sexuality beyond what is comfortable. Being uncomfortable was actually a turn ON!
3,Boring,"Let me start by saying I really Really like Anne Rice's novels. Her complex characters, their relationships and passions, the lush descriptions, the mystery and horror, and yes, the eroticism all are wonderful to me.So I was eagerly anticipating the Sleeping Beauty collection. However, it was not what I was expecting. In my opinion, the characters were all flat and one-dimensional, and I felt nothing for any of them. The endless descriptions of B/D and humiliation were as titillating as a phone book to read. I found The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty not at all erotic, only tedious. I would give it 2 stars, but I just can't do that to Ms. Rice."
1,Enough Already!,"I love myth; I love story; I love erotica. I hated this book! It's a long, grueling, repetitive NON story of spanking, torture, and more spanking. There's no plot! Just spanking and more spanking. If the editor had used ""find/replace"" function on a word processor for every instance (...)the editor wouldn't have had anything to edit. What's the deal? Don't waste your money on it. I'm sorry I did."
2,Could have been better,"It started out with promise but about halfway through, it gets monotonous. The constant spanking, slapping, and the characters unrealistic reactions to the situations just bored me. I was hoping the book would be a bit more detailed and expound upon other aspects instead of centering attention on wanting to please and begging for spankings. As an avid reader and writer of multiple verses and genres, I found this book to be rather flat. There should have been better descriptions of the events and delve into the total psychology of the characters instead of having the constant, annoying, weighing of options like 'do I give in and adore the humiliation"" and 'Why cant I be a bad pet"".I guess for the time it was written it was considered risque, but in today's day and age, it seems to be lacking the normal 'substance' that makes up good erotica. Perhaps it should be 'updated' to fit the modern times?"
3,Fair to middlin,"This reinterpretation of the classic Sleeping Beauty tale is about 1 part titilating playful sex and bondage, and 3 parts repeat to the point of overkill... Still a worthwhile read if you are into the light S&M, but save yourself the trouble of reading the next two, you could just as well reread the first one, and imagine minor changes to the scenery."
1,cruel and unusual,"Bought this as a light beach read - oops! Boring, repetitive, cruel, mean-spirited - there are only so many interesting ways to describe raw genitalia. And I prefer my s&m consensual, thanks. Wrapping a good plot around it might have helped - a little. I would give it 1/2 star if I could."
3,"Painful, yet delicious!","At first I couldn't believe what I was reading! I'm not really the type that enjoys my pleasure with pain, so I found this book quite shocking. After I read on, though, I couldn't put the book down. I was constantly asking myself what would happen to Beauty next. I tried to put myself into her place and feel what she was feeling, and the book came alive. Anne Rice does a wonderful job at creating an imaginative secret story compared to the Disney version. I was engrossed with this book and, as surprising as it is, couldn't put this book down!"
2,Not an appealing Beauty,I did not think this trilogy compared to Fifty Shades of Grey at all. The stories are totally different. This erotic take on sleeping beauty was not very facinating.
4,Not the usual fairy tale,"Light S&M revision of the well known fairy tale, this is no Disney heroine and no Disney Prince. I appreciated the humor of the Adult Version. This has not quite the eroticism of The Story of O, but a good read if you're in the mood."
1,Erotica? Not really,"As a reader of a variety of books I was very disappointed reading this book! I have read other Ann Rice and loved them (The Mayfair Witches trilogy) but this one, not so much! i do read some erotica and did read Fifty Shades. Can I say Fifty Shades is the best written plot ever? No, but I can say I thought it was pretty erotic and everything in it was consensual. The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty is anything but consensual and I have a problem with a book written purely about cruel treatment as must of the story was not about consensual acts and then try to say its erotic?? I don't think so, I can't see how a normal person would think someone explaining how they were raped over and over is erotic. The spankings and such aren't made to be erotic in my mind. Even though it's not my idea of a good time I have read stories were it seemed like fun but this is not one of those, it's harsh, a lot of rape, mistreatment and just bad!"
2,Extremely disappointed,I couldn't even finish the first book of the trilogy. It was mind-numbingly dull. How someone capable of writing such gorgeous Gothics set in New Orleans could crank out something so dry and mechanical and soul-less is beyond me. You get the feeling that maybe she just did it for the paycheck. There is so much better erotica out there; don't waste your time on this.
3,A Bit twisted for me,"Not at all what I expected, I kept reading thinkng I may be in a dream sequence but that was not the case. Graphically was not the issue, it was more the inhuman treatment of people that I had some difficulty with."
1,Absolutely filthy,"I enjoy erotic books and have read many; however, this one is unacceptable. No romance and no merit - just repeated descriptions of digusting, sick acts of violence. I couldn't finish the book and would certainly not recommend it to even the most depraved among us. I tried to give it 0 stars but the survey would not register no stars. What were you thinking, Ann Rice?????"
1,The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty,ThisThe Claiming of Sleeping Beautybook was nothing like Fifty Shades of Grey.......pure trash.......very dehumanizing to the human race.....disgusting.
4,Delicious,"I have to admit, when i first picked up The Claiming of Sleepng Beauty -- i honestly had no idea it was an erotic story! no bull!you see, i'm a self-proclaimed anne rice freak, and so when i was in the thrift shop and i picked up the book i thought ""Yay, another anne rice book!""but when i got home and opened the pages, i was in for a bit of a surprise. This book is deliciously erotic. no one can read it and be disappointed with its pleasures. i myself had to be very careful about reading it because everytime i did, i was filled with a sexual energy i did not desire....but my favorite part of this little novel is probably the part where Alexi tells his own story of capture. in my mind, prince alexi is as fine a man as can be . . . and when he told about his ""punishment"" in the castle's kitchens. . .well, let's just say his punishment was my reward!so if you purchuse this book, be warned! it is deliciously erotic and it will turn you on like a switch!"
1,If you are getting this because of Fifty Shades...don't,"I decided to read this book because it had been recommended for readers who enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey. I have no idea who (or how) they came to this conclusion, because this book has no romance, no love story, and pretty much no character development. Once you've read the first few chapters, the rest is pretty much the same: Beauty is just a novelty item, the Prince has no emotional attachment to her, the characters in the castle are all flat and one-dimensional. There are plenty of spankings, and then some more. There is plenty of humilliation too, but that's about it. Not even a twist or a turn, to keep things interesting. Just the same thing over and over again. If you must read this book, do yourself a favor and save the money: check it out at your local library."
2,Disney never saw this one coming,"The tale of sleeping beauty through out history has been the muse of countless paintings, movies, plays, and fashion photo shoots. The princess has memorized all of us with her renowned beauty and magical circumstances of sleeping a hundred years under a spell that could only be broken by a prince's true love kiss. Anne has taken the magical moment of the first kiss and turned it into something dark and fierce. No sweet tender kisses here the prince was there to claim her and he did just that. He claimed her and stole her naked back to his homeland as his new personal sex slave. I wish I could go into more detail but it is just too graphic for this my blog because I do have YA readers. This is anything but the Disney version of Sleeping Beauty."
2,Save yourself,This book is just about sex but not in a good way. I kept waiting for something good to happen to the main character in a positive direction. I would not recommend this book.
1,"Yes, well written, but a terrible story","It's interesting that this has been suggested by other readers as a book for those who liked 50 shades of grey. Sorry, but this is more like pornography than 50. It's utter degradation for Beauty, and endless beatings - spanking sounds too pleasant for what is conveyed here. Couldn't get through it as it was much too repetitive - just a series of new backgrounds for the beatings and public humiliations.I loved The Witching Hour, and the vampire stories. Not sure what led Anne Rice down this path, but they are not in the same class. Perhaps why they were written under a pen name."
2,strange book,"I just finished reading this book and I did not like it at all. I felt it was dark and the slaves are treated abominably! To be fair, it is fiction, but I will not be reading the rest of the series and I love to read a whole series of novels!I can't wait to get rid of this book and start on a new great read!"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"After reading the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" trilogy and enjoying it, I was casting about for something else to read. I read an article that this Anne Rice trilogy was being resurrected to ride on the FSOG popularity. These books should have been left dead and buried. I found this book totally boring and repetitive. And to those who would urge me to read the entire trilogy before passing judgement, I'll pass."
4,Racy and scandalous!,"I enjoyed this book but it is very racy and scandalous. Not for the prudish or easily embarrassed. Definitely not for anyone under 18 or who has led a sexually sheltered life. Or then again maybe it would break you out of your shell! Like I said before very racy!!!! Rice follows the story of Sleeping Beauty only in so much as Beauty is in an enchanted sleep when her ""Prince"" comes and awakens her with a...kiss<giggle>. After that the story goes off in a totally different direction! Must be able to view sex with levity in order to get into this book. Oh yeah and beware the bdsm."
1,Anne Rice's trilogy = hardcore; E.L. James' trilogy = soft porn,"50 Shades was my first erotica, so I picked up this novel next as I've heard so much about it after the 50 Shades explosion. Anne Rice's trilogy is a lot different (though I haven't, and will not, read the other 2 books). It is sad and cruel; I feel this trilogy is like hardcore porn, where as 50 Shades is soft porn. I understand that erotica/fantasy is all about the individual's taste and this is definitely not my taste."
3,Steamy,Excellent steamy book about strength and rebellion- Beauty is strong and deliciously hard to control - ending leaves you wanting the next book immediately
2,"Good Writing, Boring Content","As usual, Anne Rice is a great writer. However, this book is just full of spanking and silliness. Same things happen over an over with just a few small changes."
3,not mr. gray,"Much more s&m. Not a""hugs and kisses"" type of book, like 50 shades. Hardcore almost mean sexual explicitness. But that's probably the relationship of a true master/slave where there is no falling in love. After 50 shades, u expect the same kinda of book. THIS BOOK IS NOT!!! But....I couldn't put it down either. Half way in I thought, I'll finish reading this one, cuz I bought it. But I have no desire to read the other two. But as I approached the end I wanted to see what happened next. So needless to say I started book number 2 last night. So if u can keep an open mind and not compare every S&M relationship to ""50"" you'll enjoy it. S"
1,"Um, why are you still spanking her?",Jeez.... I got bored with all of the spanking about 1/4 of the way into this book. It's just not an interesting enough story to keep reading about the different ways a person can be spanked...
2,Love Anne Rice.. But This Book is Disturbing...,I had heard so much about this book..and when I saw it compared to 50 Shades couldnt wait to read it. The story could have been well written but too disburbing in some of the scenes. I am by far no prude but to compare Sadistic treatment to Erotica is so far off the mark here. I wont be buying parts 2 and 3.
4,Delivers!,"This was a good book for its purpose: erotica. Who needs deep characters and storylines, when the main themes are about slaves being spanked, stripped, and humiliated? I loved the bridle path stuff, when Beauty is oiled and groomed like a horse and then has to run while she is spanked!"
3,interesting idea but awkward lol,Okay the idea of taking fairy tales and adding some naughty really appeals to me. The opening scene of the book was what pulled me into buying the book. But after that scene it is just too much. I'm all in for a erotic story but I am not into all the pain crap. I believe you should have fun with sex but when people make it painful on purpose that just makes no sense. You can enjoy it with someone but it shouldn't be the end all of what constitutes sex. So maybe if you like that pain then you will really enjoy this book. If you just want something dabbling with it I would suggest Fifty Shades of Grey.
2,waste of my time/$$,"This was the first 'erotic' that I have read. Actually, I didn't even bother to finish it. I gave her two stars: one for originality and the other because there was some 'excitement'. If they'll take it back I'll return it to the bookstore today. I've read other Anne Rice books and I think she's an excellent writer - but this stuff... ugh. What was she thinking ruining a perfectly good children's tale?"
4,Bought it for the wife and I'm happier!,"Heard about the book from a friend and bought it for my wife and I'm a much happier for it. That is about the best recommendation a guy like me can give. She's a happy lady reading it and doing a good job of making me happy in the process.Oh, and yes I have read it. Not to my taste. A bit flowery, a bit too nice and way to much talking about thoughts and feelings. But then again I'm not the main audience.So my advice to all you guys is buy this for your special lady when she has some alone/down time. Give the book to her (nicely wrapped) with a bottle of wine, some bath goodies and come home to a very happy lady."
1,Disgusting and Relentlessly Cumbersome,"This was one of the most repetitive, sickning, and most boring book I've read so far. I can't believe an author would even attempt to destroy a childeren's fairytale with this nonsence. Having been forced to read this junk for a class, I was totally shocked at Anne Rice's degrading and horribly narrated smut. I wouldn't recommend this rubbish to anyone."
2,Proceed Reading This Book With Caution!!,"All I can say is WOW. This book is not for everyone at all. I was so disappointed and disgusted with this book. I am all about pleasure and pain and good erotica. I am in no way a prude, but this book is almost sickening. I do not mean to be offensive to those that liked the book, but this book is not about passion...it is about cruelty. It was sadistic and I cannot believe I actually read it all the way through. I love a good trilogy, but cannot fathom reading the next two books. I should have known better when the Prince awakened her by raping her, which is really what he did. I don't care what spin you put on it. She was a sex slave and there was nothing sensual about it. And how many spankings can be in one book. It was just waaaayyyy to much!!"
2,Not into rape,"I bought this book because I love Anne Rice's other books. I also was interested in reading an erotic novel that would have more depth than the popular 50 Shades series. However, this books was not sexy in any way. The couple scenes that I would have normally found enjoyment in were overshadowed by hundreds of scenes of over the top rape, humiliation, and torture. I found myself disgusted more than aroused. There was no real romance in the book. All the characters, even those nobles who are handlers, seem more like animals than actual people with emotion. I was severely disappointed with the shallow characters. I felt that this book was more of a horror story than anything resembling erotica. If read in that light, it is actually quite good."
1,NOT like 50 shades,"That's false advertising. I only read the first 20 pages and was completely turn off. It was S & M! It's degrading. For some this may be of interest but for me not, I was looking for something with romantic substance. Within the first 20 pages, Beauty was degraded, demoralized and spanked 6 times. For me it was absolutely gross and this book should not have come out of hiding."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Ive read many romance books plenty with bondage, spanking, and whips and chain... But I read to chapter 3 and stopped. Definatly not my thing.. And I edit gay and ménage romance books for a living. I found the spanking and publics nudity a little off setting but when the price let a old man fondle her in public while she just about cried I decided to return the book.. I men it was almost border line rape... But I didn't finish the book so manybe it got better but I can't image hours Of reading about beauty crying and getting spanked."
1,sleeping,This book was recommended because of Fifty Shades nothing like Fifty Shades at all. The recommendation should be taken away.
1,What a mess,"I am sure there are others who have already stated what I am about to write, however I felt it my duty as an educated reader to warn the populace about this book. I enjoy kinky writing just like the next closet freak, however this book was absolute drivel. It made little sense from beginning to end. The writing was beyond elementary. The ""show but don't tell"" rule of writing is thrown out the window. Everything the reader is supposed to learn is stated by one character or another in very dry and silly dialogue. I don't know how people got turned on while reading this. Its rediculous and not well thought out. Personally I am convinced that Anne Rice's Master made her write and publish this novel as a ""punishment"", because something so juvenile could not have been a true attempt at well written fiction."
4,Challenging--even for a liberal!,"I loved how reading this book triggered the exact emotions as eating chocolate--guilt about what I was enjoying--thinking some folks understand this thrill, some do not. A very intriguing read---um, stimulatingly different!"
3,Unique,I read it years ago and wanted to read it again on my Kindle. Very unique and interesting. I wish Anne would write more like it.
3,(no comment),"This is definately S&M. I don't really like that time of stuff, so I couldn't get into it.... at least not sexually. However the story line is pretty interesting. I am going to read the other books to find out what happened at the end though."
2,oh my,"Bought this based on my pure enjoyment of Shades... this is RAUNCHY. Wow. More than your typical chick smut - this book encompasses ALL realms of sexuality, and porn. You have to really enjoy S&M, rape, and then some for this one."
1,Actually ... It deserves no stars,"After enjoying the romance & love story of Fifty, I jumped at one reader's recommendation of the Beauty books. What a disappointment! No love story! The Prince pretty much raped her to ""awaken"" or ""claim"" her! There is no romance; no love when he makes her a (sex) slave and lets lowly villagers ogle, grope and (gasp!) spank her. I am grateful I at least did not waste my $ on the other 2. And remain still searching for my next erotic love story ...."
3,"disturbing, but still read it all","I was rather disturbed by the abuse portrayed in this book, it was nearly enough to make me too bothered to read it, but it was written in a very easy flowing way that made me get through the book before I knew it, and I did move onto the others in the series just to see how everything turns out! If I had known the extent of darkness with the abusive behavior prior to starting I don't know if I would have started."
1,"Imaginative, maybe; wonderful, no!","The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy was very disappointing. The sado-masochism was, at least to this reader, not very erotic. When I imagined naked men trussed up as ponies, replete with ""tails"", I got a case of the giggles ... I prefer the more subtle and intelligent erotica of Anais Nin. Annie...you've got the ""bite"" on vampires but I think Sleeping Beauty needs a rest!"
2,Too repititious,"I found Anne Rice too paddle-happy. I enjoy a good paddle spanking story as well as the next one. However, on every page? That was just a little too much. I was very disappointed in this book. I felt as if I was just reading the same thing over and over again - nothing new."
1,NOT IMPRESSED!,"This book was a huge disappointment! I thought it would be, as it states, ""erotic"", but not in the least! Unless you like reading about punishment and constant spankings...to the point of blistering. It was the most ridiculous story based on humiliation and degradation. I kept reading hoping it would get better but found myself disgusted at every turn. It is ridiculous and not worth the time."
5,Kinky and Addictive,"I bought this book and finished it in the same night. It was an expensive reading adventure(should have bought it on Amazon) but totally worth it. I could not put it down. A fairy tale with sadism and masochism woven in a darkly delicious manner. This is a very sexual novel, in fact it is considered ""erotica."" However, there is so much more to the book besides sex. It is also a love story, but a very disfunctional and twisted love story. Come on, this is Anne Rice, people. Would you expect anything less than disturbing and sexy? Read it. You know you want to."
4,My first erotica read...,"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty was the first erotica book I have ever read. I was not disappointed. I was already a fan of Ann Rice from her Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witches. But when I read Sleeping Beauty, I was entranced. It was a book I couldn't put down. Most women would feel embarrassed or ashamed to be caught reading an erotic book. But the way Ann Rice wrote this story, it was beautifully poetic. It was in no way pornographic in the sense of Playboy or Hustler. It was truly art. In my opinion, Sleeping Beauty could almost be compared to Michangelo's David."
1,so bad,what was i thinking? this is the worst book i ever tried to read. absolute nonsense and repetition thru each chapter. ugh i could not even finish it i feel bad because I adore Ann Rice.
3,Doesn't give me the right feel,Fifty Shades of Grey is a better written book of the sexual compliance of 2 people living a life style of perversion.
2,Boring,Page after page is exactly the same. There is no variety or plot. I rarely do not finish books but I am going to put this one down.
3,Disappointed,"The writing is actually ok. It's Anne rice. But the story is crazy! I like a little bit of drama, intrigue, etc. This was overkill. Sleeping Beauty was treated like an animal. Very sexist & hard to take most scenes. It's hard to read a book where the main character NEVER catches a break. In fact, I was waiting for her to kill herself."
2,Too Much Of The Same Thing...,"I bought the Sleeping Beauty Package with all 3 books because I heard and read so much hype about them that I just didn't want to be left out of the loop! Well, I read the majority of the first book but let me tell ya, I skimmed the last couple of chapters only to say that I actually FINISHED it! This book has WAY too much spanking in it and after awhile it just was too much! It became too tedious and frankly---BORING after awhile! Why there had to be TWO chapters of Prince Alexi explaining how and why he got captured is beyond me! Overkill, if you ask me! I didn't even read the second chapter because it was just re-hash!And, now I'm sorry I bought the package! I can't even pick up the other two books---good thing my boyfriend wants to read them! He read the first book but didn't have the opportunity to read the other two---now he does! He can HAVE them, for all I care! Personally, the hype was---in the words of Shakespeare---MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING!"
1,A story with very little pug in it,I love pugs and was so excited to read a story about a pug. But as I started to read I realized there was really very little about about pugs and much more about the authors life. I kept reading hoping the pugs would get the intergal part they deserved and was disapointed until the end.
1,"If you love your pug, not a good read","I only read through the first few chapters of this book and had to put it down - forever. I began to hate Margo more and more with each page. She clearly does not ""get"" what it means to be a dog-owner, especially a pug owner. Her first reaction when she sees her new puppy, Clara, is to call her husband crying because the dog's tail wasn't perfectly curled had a white stripe on it. Give me a break! Any person with an once of compassion would have immediately smothered the puppy with hugs, kisses and love. Margo needs to get over her spoiled, conceited self and learn that she can't always be the center of the universe."
2,The story of the adoption process that ruled Margo's life,"Clara is cute, but the story of the adoption process is not. Neither is Ms. Kaufman's blatant materialism. Her comment of wanting a child, any child as long as it's cute was pitiful.Actually, I can't stand kids which is why I have pugs instead. For unlike children pugs are greatful, always cute, adoring and not an investment in tragedy. So why would I give a hoot about Kaufman's boring and arduous adoption process????For the love of pugs, don't waste your time with this book!!"
4,Required Reading,I have assigned this book as required reading to any and all of my friends who think that I am just a little out of touch with reality when it comes to my Pugs. Perhaps it will prove to them once and for all that Pugs are not dogs and should never be treated as such.
3,disappointing,"If I finish a book it automatically gets three stars. And finish this one I did even though I skipped a lot of paragraphs regarding the adoption of the russian child. The author, who quite frankly, is not real likable uses her pug Clara (who is of course, the most interesting dog on the planet according to Margot and supposedly EVERYONE Clara encounters) to sell a book that is ultimately about adopting a Russian baby. So if you are interested in reading a book that has a pug in it but is ultimately about adopting a baby from a foreign country this is your book."
4,Finding Pug Talk Magazine,Ms Kaufman speaks of Pug Talk magazine in this book and I cannot find it anywhere. Would someone please help me locate it. Thnx Karen Ward and Owen MacPherson
4,This book was so fun to read,"I agree with the other reviewers...I am saddened by the passing of Margo Kaufman...We really lost someone special in her.Now concerning the book,It was extremely funny. Kaufman's descriptions are not overbearing, she describes scenes, without you paying attention to the words she uses, and draws you in. The book read like a conversation with the author over coffee. Clara the title character and her nemesis Sophie are memorable with distinct personalities.Oh and to those of you who have read the book already--one phrase: ""Sophie Puppet-time"". I laughed for at least five minutes. I don't think I'd want Sophie for a pet, but she was easily my ""Favorite Pug in a Supporting Role.""This book was a fun quick read that I didn't want to end. When I finally finished it, I was thinking is that it. I wanted the story to keep going. I'm sure you'll feel the same way when you read it."
4,Pug Mania,I really enjoyed reading this book! As a new pug owner I found that this book shows me what I have to look forward to! Margo Kaufman is a very talented writer and her experiences with her pugs are very funny! This is definately a very good book to read!
5,Erica Asahan Book List,"Erica Asahan wrote:I just got done reading this wonderful book! There are parts where I laughed so hard and a couple of areas where I was scratching my head, because I did not quite understand? And I am very saddened to learn that Margo K., has passed away, RIP. Over all, I do love this book and will own it till the day I go. Clara is so much like my Bota. She is amazing!"
4,Perfect Pug lover gift!,"If you have pugs you will love this book - so true to the nature of Pugs. I found myself laughing right along with the story and saying out loud, ""oh, my...my pug is JUST LIKE THAT!"". Wish I could get several more copies. Wish they weren't used but it was very gently used so I'm still passing it along (after I finish it, that is!)"
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for software to install on my laptop to lighten my load while taking classes and provide more power in researching and studying. My laptop has an external CD drive, and the software could not be effectively installed on the hard drive despite various attempts. When it was working, the interface was primitive and the selection of Bibles very limited - it has quite a few versions, but few that are regularly used. NIV was even missing. Personally, I would not download a free version of this software, and would definitely not purchase it."
3,Nena Revisited,I liked the album and I find it quite different than her original versions but I would recommend that if you don't own any of her material then buy the original 99 Luftballons cd. I would have to recommend Eisbrecher or Feuer und Flamme over this one as well. If you are a BIG fan and own all the other albums you wouldn't be reading this but you would have ordered Nena Revisited the day of release!
5,LOVE IT,It looks just like the style of my grohe faucets. spent so much already. was looking for cheaper accessory for the bathrooms but still look good. I found just the thing i was looking for. bought other accessories related to this one and they are all so perfect! love the fact that we can now hang both bath towels in a smaller space and now have to wash towels every 3 days.
3,"Pretty, but light quality","Looks sleek, but you get what you pay for... it is feather light, inferior gage metal, and since I have just ordered it, I am not sure how it will hold up. Am afraid it will chip off or scratch easily through normal use. I hope not, but because it matches the toilet paper holder from Gatco, which I love the look of, I will keep it. Not a bad product, but not amazing by any stretch. Make your own decision."
5,Solid quality,Looks good. Solid. Installed easily. Great that it can hang 2 full-size bath towels separately. I would definitely recommend this.
4,"Yes, it is two mats!","Just making sure everyone know this is two mats, not one. Listing is misleading. Good heavy duty mats with deep channels."
5,Beautiful and very helpful to my own liveaboard experience.,"While I do not own a copy personally, I have repeatedly borrowed this book from the local library. Now someone else has permanently ""borrowed"" it, and I will need to buy a copy! I have found it to unparalleled in providing information and inspiration in my first years as a liveaboard aboard a 30' sailboat. While I could never hope to own a boat like most of the ones shown in this book, the photos and text take me right inside the boats and lives of their owners, helping me find my own comfort level and validating my own desires and needs below decks. A friend to me for years, I cannot say enough about it."
2,Rather dated material,"I started out with a mean review of this book, but then I started to feel guilty, so will keep it simple. This is clearly a 1970's style production, and the choice of images, image quality, etc. reflect it. If that was your time, and you like that sort of thing, by all means go for it. If your looking for well shot images of exceptional yacht interiors or ideas for a restoration project (like me) then keep looking or get if from a library first to decide if its worth owning. As someone who is willing to look at pictures of almost anything nautical, I found it pretty disappointing - mostly because it is so out of date and unprofessional by modern standards. There are a few classic yacht images worth seeing, but much of it is run-of-the-mill boat interiors of the day. I regret being so harsh because I'm sure a lot of work went into this in its day, but in my opinion, it is time to let go."
1,Classic Yacht Interiors,This book is out of date for today's interiors. It isn't worth the money to buy it and then pay to return it!
2,A Bit Floppy...,"My laptop computer slides in easily and comfortably, but it doesn't exactly provide reliable protection. I use it in my booksack so that I can take my laptop with me to class, and as a result my laptop has developed a severe wobble to its joint for opening and closing the computer. I would recommend a bigger, more padded laptop case - even though it will be bulkier and more expensive, it's definitely worth it for the safety and security of your laptop."
3,pretty good,"It works well and my laptop fits inside with plenty of room, but it doesn't have as much padding as I thought it would. It seems like my laptop is not that protected, but I am overall satisfied with it. It serves the purpose I wanted it too,which is to protect my laptop from scratches and the like."
3,"Too Wide for my 15.4"" MacBook Pro","This case is way too wide for a 15.4"" MacBook Pro. There's a good 1-2 inches of extra material, which is not what I was looking for. The padding is nice, and I like that there are no zippers, but in my opinion, it's too big for the laptop."
3,"Nice case, too big for MacBook Pro 15in","This is a really nice case, the smaller size is great for the old MacBook. However it is to small for my new MacBook pro, and the 15 in case is way to large. A friend got one for his Dell and it fits perfectly."
4,Blacker does rate with Lowry,"This book is good, but I agree- it has very much potential to be even better than what it is. When I first spotted this book, I thought it almost childish- but it is very well worded and it is truly a work of art. Blacker needs to round it off with a sequel."
4,Great story but one big annoyance,"I thought this was a great story, but was very distracted in the early chapters by a glaring (to this California native) error in geography. The family is supposed to be vacationing in Santa Barbara. The text refers to their visits to Hollywood Studios and Disneyland as if Santa Barbara is in the LA area -- it's not. You certainly can visit those places from St. B. but you'll be driving 2-3 hours each way. Later the boyfriend, Luke, says he wants to go to a surfing competition UP the coast in Ventura. Ventura is an hour or so SOUTH of Santa Barbara. This was really annoying me so I had to mentally substitute Santa Monica (in LA and fits the details better) for Santa Barbara. Blacker and his editor need to look at a map."
5,A good book!,"From the beginning to the end, The Angel Factory was a compelling novel. Young little Thomas Wisdom had perfect parents, a perfect family, a perfect life. All that changes when he finds out a secret about his parents and himself. The truth, if he is willing to believe it, will change his life and the lives of billons of people like him. One wrong move and that's the end of the world. The book kept me interested and surprised throughout the whole book. This book was a fantasy book but it seemed like real things happened. People who like fantasy books would like this book. I think it should be read by people who are in sixth grade and above. It was one of the best books I've ever read!"
1,Tiger put me to sleep,I got this book from a friend in Salinas and tried to read it. I was told the author said it was a 'page turner'. It was boring and predidtable. It must be Henke's first book as he cannot tell a story without falling all ove his own words. He must be very 'full of himself' in real life as he comes through as a boring person who brags about anything he does which is probably nothing.Don't waste your money on this book.
5,Fender P-51 mic Kit S/O,Love this mic. Very clear. The specs. that were provided was great. Would buy this item again and would recommend it to others
3,No no no no no.........,"Boulez' capacity to elicit the inner workings of a score can be stupendous at times. With this particular disc, this skill becomes the problem. In trying to convey those little undercurrents about 'La Mer' that Debussy felt and later put into music, Boulez forgot the overall human sensation and merely clarified that it happens. It's wonderful to hear those intricacies but when they are borishly played, what's the point? The 'Nocturnes' pale in comparison to Haitink's and the clarinet rhapsodie is the dullest I've heard.This disc's contents suffer from the weight of over-interpretation and are better off ignored.I continue to enjoy seeing all the 'unhelpful' votes I get for this review. It's as if Boulez is 'untouchable'. I totally disagree. His Mahler 6 with the VPO is an incontestably great recording. This Debussy disc, unfortunately, is not."
2,Urp,"Geez, maybe I have a heart of stone. I wasn't a bit moved by the overrated Streep and handsome Clint. It's a story about two hearts linked as one - a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good - a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy, bored adults. Yawwwwn. Streep can do any accent on the planet, and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than Marcel Marceau. That doesn't make her an actress - just a clever chameleon. I'd rather watch Julia Roberts play herself over and over and over than see Streep play ""pretend"" roles. There, I've said it. Now goodnight."
1,Unpleasant to watch,"This movie endorses adultery to placate women suffering from boredom. Robert Kincaid shouldn't be driving around Madison County plowing with other men's heifers.The writer of this story obviously intended otherwise, but the only person I felt sad for at the end of this movie was the unaware husband.After witnessing how devastatingly painful the effects of adultery can be by having had friends that experienced it. I can't fathom why anyone would even attempt to show this in a positive light."
1,VERY DULL,"I lived in Iowa for a few years and I took my wife (who hated the movie too) to Madison county to see the bridges. We saw these 2 older women walking on one of the bridges and we heard them say, ""And this is where Francesca sees him...""I almost yelled, ""Get a life"". I don't get the attraction at all.I really like Meryl Streep as an actress, but this movie is just bad and very boring."
2,excellent,the BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY movie is one of my favorites. i had a copy to use with a VCR which just broke. so i needed a dvd. i love it.
2,Glorifies adultery...,"Very romantic, but glorifies adultery. I just can't like a movie that does that."
4,A real tearjerker....,"This is a story of what could happen when someone settles for less when they're young, and later on in life, they find the real thing. This is just what happens to the two pivotal characters, Robert and Francesca, in this film. It moves a bit slowly, but it is a very engaging story about a ill-fated romance between older adults, starting in the mid-'60s, and ending only when one of them passes away...and not even then! If you like to cry at movies, then this is definitely one you should pick up. By the time the film ends, you would've went through a box of Kleenex!"
4,wonderful tear-jerker,"Although most stayed away from the theaters(myself included) when the movie opened, presumably turned off by the idea of Clint Eastwood as a romantic lead,this movie truly deserves a second chance on video. Adapted from Robert James Whaller novel, the film is a moving look at true love that comes too late. The characters are wonderfully acted by Oscar winners Streep and Eastwood. As usual Streep shines in her portrayal of Franchesca. Making us feel her dispair in a situation she never thought she would be in. But it is Eastwood who believably portrays Robert's anguish after finding love and knowing that it just can't be. Eastwood also directed."
5,Good Movie,This is Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep at their best. If you like adult romance stories this is the one you want to purchase and place in your DVD library. I watched this DVD on my HD big screen and it was like watching a real personal love story up close.
2,Bridges of Madison County,"Two amazing actors but not particularly believable together in a romance. A slow plot that doesn't gather much momentum. I couldn't imagine their relationship working anyway (seemed much more like an unrealistic fling on both parts) and so couldn't really get into the romance, which is the basis of the film. And this is coming from a totally sentimental, cry out a box of Kleenex gal. And what was to stop her from adding a little spice to her own marriage? Her husband wasn't an entirely unlikeable guy. When he asked her why she was crying in the end, that was a chance to offer up something to him. Overall unrealistic, which dampened any attempt to get into the movie and characters. And the ""Italian"" accent seemed more Eastern European."
3,Francesca,"This was a book I loved but the movie was disappointing. I loved Clint as Robert, but Meryl really bothered me as Francesca. She had a stilted, bizarre way of moving and talking (no, the accent wasn't convincing) and I just couldn't buy her as arousing such passion in Eastwood's character. I still cried at the end when she had to make the choice. And I loved the music, much of which, I understand, was from Clint's collection."
5,An unforgettable love story!,"Is there a more beautiful love story than this one... NO. It's all in softness, and so romantic. What do you do when you are emotionnaly detached from a boring husband, and alone for a few days on an isolated farm in Iowa, when you can feel like a women in love again with someone like Clint Eastwood... seriously, all the ingredients are there for a very moving love story that touches our heart very deeply. I had the chance to ""relive"" that beautiful love story when I visited the different locations where the movie has been shot. I am not about to forget that wonderful day!"
3,Only slightly better than the book,"What are the chances of finding new love on your doorstep when you've been married for years, living on a farm in Iowa? Very slim. Yet it happens in The Bridges Of Madison County.What made this movie a bit better than the book was the sense of humor of both characters - something that was sorely lacking in the written format. A scene where Robert picks flowers for Francesca is made more endearing in the film when Francesca mischieviously jokes about them being poisonous.Neither the book nor the film convinced me that this was truly love. I strongly feel that both characters saw in the other a life that was unfamiliar and alluring to them. Robert saw a life settled down in one place and Francesca saw a life of roaming the world, finding adventure. I think they fell in love with that possibility, not each other. But neither of them realized it and instead mistook it for a deep, romantic love."
3,Great movie ... damaged?,"I absolutely love this movie! Playing it on my laptop and getting ""skipping over damaged part"" (or words to that effect) ... ??????? Why is it damaged? Got this message twice!"
1,"I hated it. So did my sister, and she likes romantic movies.","I am a male, I'm 20 and I'm single, so maybe I wasn't the indicated to enjoy this movie. I really hated it, it was sooo slow, long and boring. But my elder sister is 32, she's married, and she loves to read romantic novels (all of them awful in my opinion). She even read the Bridges of Madison County novel and liked it. But she hated the movie as much as I did. If anybody has an explanation for that, please tell me."
1,JUMP OFF THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY,"So romantically cloying, it bathes viewers in a love story that's about as subtly manipulative as tar and feathers. It starts off well enough with Eastwood arriving in a small Iowa farm town to photograph bridges for National Geographic and meeting immigrant housewife Streep with a thick Italian ( Italian? I would have guessed Czecklesovokian! ) accent. After a sexual encounter the two carry on a brief but passionate affair that's about as invigorating and sexy as Barbie kissing Ken. Through it all, Streep's husband is away at a county fair concerning something about a 'prize cow'. Talk about your Freudian nightmare! It took me several sittings to get through this tear-jerker which comes equipped with it's own box of soggy Kleenix."
1,"After 45 minutes of Iowa, we left","I was born in Iowa and love the landscape of that state, Nebraska, etc., but this movie managed to bore me to tears after a mere 45 minutes. I have only ever walked out of two movies and this was one of them. It was painful watching two of my favorite actors wasting their time in what was a piece of drivel to begin with, but which I had hoped would be redeemed by their presence. No such luck, it was still unbelievable drivel. I couldn't get the recommendation box let me say ""anything but this!"""
1,"Boring tripe! No, that's an insult to tripe!","I am in awe that so many can find this dreary, boring self indulgence so ""beautiful"" and ""lovely""! I hate this garbage!This has to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. And please! Spare me Eastwood's method acting! Actualy, no, that's not true - Eastwood doesn't act - he's just Eastwood. Don't get me wrong now. Clint has his place in westerns and the odd cop shooting-say nothing-look mean Dirty Harry fuilm, but the Great Lover! N0 WAY!Moreover, while you're all getting all gooey over the so called ""love story"", just remember that this is just a glorification of adultery! I am no prude, but come on! At least TRY to set an example in the movies you make!Awful! In fact, I have never managed to endure it long enough to see it in full!"
1,It's a sad day when Clint does films like this.,"Clint doesn't destroy one bridge. Remember ""Where Eagles Dare""? They blew up a bridge at the end of the movie. Not here he only takes stupid pictures. Please Mr. Eastwood don't make a sequel."
1,Bridges...will NOT make your day!,"Again the critics dissapoint me. This movie was an utter disgrace. I was anticipating such a great film but was left kicking myself for enduring the entire film naievely waiting for the story to thicken or grab my interest. The movie in general had a very monotone feel about it. Granted it's not an action flick. However, I have seen some fantastic love stories. This is definitely 1 of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen (READ THE BOOK!)"
1,dvdlegacy is a lousy seller,"Nothing to review. Never received my order. Emailed seller twice, no responce. Recieved email from seller 4/1/09 said item is being shipped, HaHa, must have been an ""April Fools"". Seller should be removed from Amazon. Buyers are being ripped off and nobody is doing anything about it.Amazon should back their buyers and get them their purchase or get them a refund. Numerous complaints from other members. Very disappointed with Amazon."
4,For once - a movie that's better than the original book,"This isn't a movie that will hit you on the head and change your life - it's smaller than that. If anything, it's about how the simplest things sometimes have more depth than anyone would imagine. Beautifully directed by Robert Redford who has the wisdom to let Streep and Eastwood just *be* - their chemistry is an unexpected and delightful surprise, with both actors putting in quiet, touching performances. It's Clint Eastwood as you've never seen him. A fine soundtrack adds to the overall quality of this film.My one complaint about Bridges of Madison County is the sub-plot, concerning the main character's adult children, which I find to be clunky and badly acted. More care should have been taken in casting these roles, as the actors have zero charisma - a stark contrast to Streep and Eastwood.Watch this one with someone you love."
1,damaged,waited to long to view - and it was damaged - can't return it - don't order older dvds on line
2,read the book instead,Read the book instead... it's much much richer and better done. Clint is awesome... but the book simply is perfect!
2,LUST AND BETRAYAL,"I gave it two stars because of the outstanding performances of Streep and Eastwood, otherwise I would have given it only one star. So! It seems many reviewers went through boxes and boxes of Kleenex tissue while watching this movie. I found the story line quite sobering and depressing. Francesca has been married for twenty years or more to a faithful husband who loves her, and while he is away on a camping trip with the kids, lo and behold, she plays tiddly-winks behind her husband's back with a roaming, divorced photographer because she is bored with her existence. Well, isn't that a shame! What happened to her vows, ""Until death do us part?"" The plot was so inane, it was embarrassing.And what a legacy she left for her kids! She recorded her affair. Please! I would rather not have seen the film. It left me feeling not too good about the human race."
2,Two stars is generous,"This could have been quite a good movie but the selection of actors was inappropriate. Streep was from the first scene too worldly to be believable.The story had potential, but Eastwood was probably too close to the film to do it justice. He too was unconvincing. The brother and sister get the alocades here, for their excellent supporting roles.The sound track was relentlessly boring and stereotyped. During the dance scenes I considered switching it off, but I am glad I did see the ending. I'll read the book."
1,Where's the Widescreen?,"I saw it on TV, wanted to own the DVD, but in this day of all TV sets eventually going to 1.85:1 imagine these numskulls issuing the movie in 4:3 only. I will not buy any more 4:3."
2,It Just Left No Impression,"Times like this I wish there were a way Amazon could allow us to specify when a product is a gift, which means the giver may not actually have viewed the product. In this case, although I did indeed purchase the DVD as a birthday present to my fraternal twin sister, I had watched the movie some years back and despite its two well-established stars, the movie itself made no impression on me, and I have no desire to see it again. I recall Eastwood was playing a photographer, and wanted to photograph a covered bridge, which was reflected in the title, but I cannot recall how Streep's character fit in with that, or the relationship that must have sprung up between the two. The relatiohship between H.G. Wells and Amy in Time After Time was much more intriguing and interesting to me."
4,Clint Eastwood last of the Giants in Hollywood,"This movie is so emotional and it proove if it was necessary that Clint Eastwood is a giant in the film industry the last one i mean! This DVD is perfect for discovering all the sensibility of this man who are not only ""Dirty Harry""."
4,Useful,"I've taken several math classes so the chapters that covered material in which I was familiar seemingly flew by, where as others were quite boring. I didn't work out any of the problems, but upon inspection they seemed like they were upper undergraduate level problems. The problems dealt with geometric proofs, number theory, binomial expansion, sequences and series, etc. so for the reader, they might get more out of the book if they've taken the prerequisite classes. Hope this helps."
4,Text Book,"This book definitely served its purpose! It was the required text for a Math class I took, and the information in it was great - perfectly supplemented the material. I suppose it had too, since it was the required text. A little technical at times, but each chapter starts off with a nice historical overview."
2,disappointing,"Interesting subject, well researched but poor formatting and rushed or non-fleshed out reasoning makes this text incredibly disappointing. Not worth your money. If you are at all rusty on algebra and arithmetic, you will get lost or be frustrated with the demonstrations and problems shown in the book. Even the answer guides in the back are poor illustrations of well-worked, fully explained problems. You find a lot of ""and so because of X formula, we can see Y"". You will think to yourself, how in the world did one make a logical step from the previous statement to the last. The chapters and chapter sections are also very inconspicuous and figures do not relate well to the surrounding text. Quite terrible book unfortunately."
3,Nothing Special to report,"This book is too long, there's no way more than half of it can be covered in a semester. The problems are very easy and don't require the reader to think too often. I think this book had a hard time finding it's identity. The chapters are written like a history book with little computation involved but the questions at the end are all math based, generally reapeating the same concept over and over again. I'd say there are better, more concise, Math History books out there....for a cheaper too!!!"
2,Caution. Accuracy in question,"The results of these strips didn't look right so I decided to test them. Water is a neutral 7.0. First I tried carbon-filtered tap water and got a reading of 5.0. While carbon filters aren't perfect, water should never be that acidic. To be sure I bought a jug of distilled water from the pharmacy. To make sure nothing could skew the results I got a strip from the bag, opened the jug, stuck the strip in for 2 seconds, pulled it out and took a reading. It was 5.0 with a bit of color (maybe 5.2). That can't be good readings.The strips must be old or bad. Either way I caution you not to make health decision based on your strips until you verify to your satisfaction your batch is accurate."
5,good work mattel!!,"i was so excited to find this bed, along with the other furniture at toys r us..after purcasing it i got home and ripped open the box only to be even more surprised that it had an actuall matress, beautiful sheets and great accessories..this is a great deal and worth every red cent, great for collectors and kids..check out the other furniture items too, they make and awesome room!"
2,Fashion Fever Sweet Dreams Bed,"This is a beautifully made bed with real mattress and sheets! Has the look and feel of Barbie and Francie's vintage furniture. Great for the adult collector as well as for children. The other FF furniture pieces go work well with this bed. Packaged nicely, also!"
4,A worthwhile addition to the DEMON CITY series.,"DEMON PALACE BABYLON is a stand-alone, 2-volume manga series that is part of Hideyuki Kikuchi's DEMON CITY SHINJUKU universe that was created with the publication of the novel of the same name (which has - sadly - not yet been translated into English) in 1982 and continued in a number of manga comics.Shinichi Hosoma's artwork for DEMON PALACE BABYLON is a significant improvement over his previous, earlier work on DEMON CITY HUNTER. He really has come a long way in the 10 years between those two series!The story of DEMON PALACE BABYLON is rooted in Sumerian mythology and sees a arrival of an enormous, mysterious floating palace of the Demon City. Kyoya, Sayaka and Dr. Mephisto must deal with its lord and the sinister plans he has for Sayaka.DEMON PALACE BABYLON is a brisk, entertaining, pulpy read that I can recommend to anyone who's a fan of the DEMON CITY SHINJUKU anime or Hideyuki Kikuchi in general."
3,Blowing the blues,"The good news is Merano provides a complete set of color coded harmonicas including sharps and flats in a carrying case which will fit other harmonica brands. One of the harmonicas in the set was defective and Merano responded promptly and courteously with a replacement. I was able to bend the reeds easily with the following harmonicas A flat, B flat. The draw on the B and G harmonicas was tight and airy. The draw on the A,C,D,D flat, E,E flat, F and F sharp was unresponsive. However each harmonica's sound is bright when playing straight tones. But in order to play the blues with performance quality sound I could only use the A and B flat harps. You get what you pay for...a complete set of harmonicas with an excellent carrying case, but not the quality or reed flexibility of a Lee Oskar (Tombo) harmonica."
4,monroe quick-strut 17116r 17116l,THESE STRUT US SHIP FAST AND THEY FIT LIKE A GLOVE VERY EASY TO IN STALL. WOULD BUT AGAIN. VERY GOOD PRICE...............
5,A perfect fit n ride for my 2002 Grand Prix GT.,"These 2 rear Quick Struts were quick n easy to replace my old ones on my 2002 Grand Prix GT. To remove the anti-sway bar connection from the rear struts, just put a socket on the bolt to the outside of the car, even though in the center of the bolt there looks to be an allen screw to remove first (it faked me out for a few minutes), n an openend wrench on the back side of the strut where the anti-sway rod connection meets the bolt, n remove rod from strut. Used only a jack n jack stands. The 2 rear Quick Struts are both same part numbers, but are with Right n Left, at the end. The old ones were originals at 162,000 miles n were totally shot! I've got a great ride again, thanks to Monroe n their $125 rebate on 4 Quick Struts, deadline for purchase was Oct 31, total price was $307! I'd do it again. They were shipped quickly n arrived on-time."
2,TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS USED~!,"I am dissapointed! I ordered what I thought I would recieve a NEW Patriots License plate and to my surprise it was used! Scratched and faded! Not what I thought I was paying for! If I would have known it was used, I would have ordered a more expensive plate and got my moneys worth!"
3,Understated but good,If your looking to hear Oteil stretch out Love of a Lifetime is a better choice.
2,"Very cute, but the drawer falls out","My daughter received this for Christmas and we all loved it, except the draw falls out! For 1: the opening for the draw is wider than the draw and it just drops and 2: even if it did fit you can pull the draw all the way out and it will land on your lap. We are returning this and finding another."
1,Cheap,"This vanity is so cute and my daughter loved receiving it for Christmas but the mirror came scratched, the drawer does not open and close properly and has now eventually broken."
5,A Beautiful Book,"This is a beautiful book - there's no other way to say it. A wonderful story of life in the North Woods, and of its wildlife as experienced by Helen and Ade Hoover. Like Helen's other books, this one is illustrated with Ade Hoover's beautiful drawings."
4,Waited ten years for this video!,"Unfortunately, living in the UK, it's hard to get hold of REO music and videos but it was great to finally get to watch this one. A fantastic cross section of all of their hits with original videos and live clips from the Wheels are Turnin' show and the 'terrible' 1981 show at Denver McNichols Arena. Sorry but it was bad compared to the magic of the later years. Live Every Moment - Live was actually the studio album version overdubbed onto live video footage from the Wheels.. show, with the overdubbed echo and crowd noise...why? Also, why the cheering in between each video? Some puzzles there but otherwise a video you'll want to watch over and over again! Can't wait for the next one."
5,My Favorite Cookbook,"I was in New York City and had tickets to Good Morning America the day Faith was there promoting this cookbook. I got to meet her and eat some of the Applesauce cake which was delicious. I couldn't wait to get the cookbook. I have tried a new recipe everyday and so far, all are wonderful. I also love the format of the book and the personal notes. It is like when your best friend gives you a recipe and tells you the little tricks to make it extra good. I have been so inspired by this cookbook and being a southern girl myself, I understand and appreciate the anecdotes. You won't be disappointed."
3,Not sure if it did anything,"My trunk rattled before putting this stuff on and it continued to rattle after applying it. A lot of prep work is required, removing and cleaning where you want to apply it to. I slathered it on liberally and let it dry overnight before reinstalling the felt back into the trunk. Only real bright spot is that it is light. Dynamat is really heavy and adds a lot of weight. Maybe you'll able to tell the difference, I couldn't."
2,Buy a Cookbook Insead,"Though not completely useless, this item has done little to improve my cooking. I like how the technology allows you to change the proportion of your measurements. However, I don't like the recipes and the look and feel of the product is quite dated."
4,pay attention,"pay attention when ordering these parts. Some say ""plug"" or ""In-line plug"" but have a picture of the Jack. The Jack is the Female connector, and the plug is the Male end."
5,Excellent medium speed film.,"This is an excellent b&w film, especially if you use either a 35mm SLR OR a 6 x 6 or 6 x 7cm SLR film camera. It's a fine grain film when processed at it's original ISO of 100. It also push processes very well. If you have an slr with an excellent quality lens and are interested in shooting black and white, this is a good all-purpose film. Recommend that you eiher process the film yourself, or have a trustworthy professional photo lab process it."
1,Don't buy this!,"I totally agree with the review ""A music fan"" wrote. Mercury didn't want Toby's bold and very creative writing, but now they are trying to cash in! Isn't it great they at least sold him his own songs back for the CD ""How do you like me now""? They refused to release the CD and the rest is history with his new label. :-)"
5,Toby At Mercury,"This CD is obviously not for you if you want all of Toby's hits up 'til today. But if you're a true Toby fan, this is a nice addition to your CD collection of him. The Millennium Collection nicely captures Toby's hit making days at Mercury Records. Although Getcha Some and a couple more are missing, it does include other greats like Should've Been A Cowboy, Who's That Man, Dream Walkin', Wish I Didn't Know Now, and eight more."
1,Big Disappointment,"The first CD - Talk Now! - was nice for learning some basic vocabulary items and expressions. It's good to know before you buy it that you get nothing but vocabulary, no grammar at all. The second CD surprised me because I imagined it would be more of the same, but you can't use the second CD UNLESS YOU ALREADY KNOW ARABIC! That struck me as bizarre, since I expected the second to build on the first. But they were miles apart in level."
3,average,"I give this CD series an average rating. initially i was quite disappointed because there was not an accompanying book to learn script. however, while the information is quite basic, it provides a good foundation for further study.One should note though, that while the tapes do not specify, the instructors teach the Lebanese dialect and slang without also teaching proper arabic."
2,not for serious study!,I bought this program not expecting much because of the low price and my expectations were correct. This program seems to be designed for a person who wants to learn a few Arabic terms that would be useful a couple weeks before traveling to an Arab country. It is definitely not a serious student of the language especially because it does not even use the Arabic script! It just transliterates Arabic words into Roman script.
1,Don't bother with this product,This DVD is out of range for most individuals becase the software needed to run it is way too old. This DVD runs off of Windows 95. Who on earth still uses this? It can't even be run on a MAC.
2,blah,"it's ok for VERY basic Arabic, animation is awful, and does not keep interest long. But I guess for the price it's not too bad."
4,Good program for learning basic words,"This is a nicely set up program for learning arabic words and phrases. It works great if that is what you want to do. However, this is not a program for learning the arabic language. If you want to actually study the language, nothing beats a textbook. Or maybe the really expensive software packages. But I would recommend this program for learning basic words and phrases."
1,4 Stars only if....,...you are homeless and want to practice martial arts but don't have any money to spend.
5,"Truper 30314 Tru Pro 54-Inch Manure Fork 5-Tine, Ash Handle","This fork offers the very high quality and strength needed to perform all the tasks I require. Although this heavy construction adds a little more weight, it is well worth it."
3,Of Interest,"I purchased this version of the monks of Santo Dominto De Silos at the same time I bought the 2008 edition of the Gregorian chant by the Cistercian Monks of Stift Heiligenkreuz (Chant: Music for the Soul). While the effort of the Santo Domingo monks was highly praised when it was released, I fully understand why the version by the Cistercian monks of Stift Heiligenkreuz was so brightly hailed. The Spanish recording seems regimented, in contrast to that of the Austrian Cistercian monks of 2008, who seem quite sublime, un-regimented, and singing only in response to their devotion to God. Even so, this recording by the Spanish monks is clear, pure, and by the books; it is authentic. If you are interested in Gregorian chant, you should have a chant rendition of this style in your repetoire because these fellows deliver it in a style considered normal in the recording world before their performance was usurped for many by the Austrian monks."
2,So-so,"I was looking forward to receiving this CD because I love chant and because I had walked some of the Camino de Santiago. It was in Burgos, Spain that I heard about the CD. But the CD was a disappointment because there was very little variety in the chants and they all began to sound all alike. I found myself getting bored."
4,NOT BY WYNTON MARSALIS,"This book is written by someone else. It's a perfectly good history of Jazz, but Amazon is misleading in the author tag. Wynton only wrote the foreword."
2,sara henry wood handle tote french heart,"This tote is much larger than indicated more like 22""by14"". The design on the tote by the artist Sara Henry is really cute, however the company that manufactured the tote besides making it almost grotesquely oversized also did a very poor job with the color dyes used. The colors in the picture of the tote online look much nicer to me than the tote actually looked when I received it and the tote has a funny odor. Although the workmanship and detailing on the tote is very well done the wood handles seem dwarfed by the large size of the tote and the detachable shoulder strap does not sit the purse comfortably next to one's body. It's too bad because this could have been a really cute fun tote. I don't think the arist, Sara Henry has control over the manufacturing of the tote only the design and the design is darling. Hope the manufacturer makes some changes in the size and dyes used on this and the other Sara Henry totes."
5,They omitted the Harsh! Excellent and Exciting!,"They bill themselves as an ""Urban Blend"" band. Lots of brass, keyboard, guitar and percussion behind the lead singer in the best mix yet from Bucho. In this, Bucho's first labeled album, we can actually hear the words and understand the lyrics. Having heard them onstage in a jazz club in Tacoma, I may have a better appreciation of this jazz/latin/pop fusion band of professionals. Rumor has it that all are classically trained and play multiple intruments. All original songs. I have two of their albums and will definitely purchase their next ones. See them live. Good show!"
3,A Second View,"I bought this book, as a indication of my professor at university, because i had to start a questionnaire regarding my field search to my thesis, as i was a complete begginer in the field of quastionnaires, it gave me a overview of the main problems during the process of starting one, evaluate and also about thinking on small details of the questionnaire that might do a difference in the outcome of it.But its sort of too widespread, it doenst guide you step by step, to conduct what you want, anyway i indicate it, but beeing aware that is not a perfet book to begginers"
3,Looks cool - but the quality?,"I bought the model with the leather band. Overall it is a very nice watch - but a little heavy. The thing that freaks me out about the watch is that the pointer for seconds and the seconds on the dial don't match. I might be able to change that somewhere, but for a $200 watch that should work."
3,Needs Editing,"While the content is what I expected, the formatting needs work and the wonderful pictures are not included in the Kindle edition."
2,don't bother,Blue Rodeo has a small fan base in the U.S. and I am one of them; been with them since Diamond Mine. Their music is great but they can't put out a decent DVD; this one is home movies with so-so sound. Their more professional one released a few years ago was so difficult to navigate I just gave up on it. Hey Blue Rodeo; why don't you get a professional crew and do a straight electric concert in DTS or Dolby Digital? Don't waste your money on this one
3,Product is OK,"Makes clothes look brighter, but does not get stains out well. I have to use more than the recommended amount."
3,MGB Complete Handbook,"This book is anything but complete. There are large things missing like the exhaust and header system, 1971-1974 wire diagrams and other stuff that I can't remember right now. The information that is there is quite good, however. I would consider this to be an indispensable reference despite its being incomplete. This manual, with other references like Haynes, etc, is just one piece of the puzzle that are British Motor Cars."
3,A bit lacking,"This manual is a whole lot better than not having a manual. However, some of the text is a little difficult to understand because of the differences in terminology. ""Boot"" instead of ""trunk"" and ""bonnet"" instead of ""hood"" is only the beginning. Also found that some things, like a wiring diagram for my '74 MGB, were missing. Disassembly of some key areas is missing too, like the dashboard or ""fascia"". Still, if you are going to make a choice between this and the Haynes manual, buy this one. As for me, I'm still looking for something better."
2,You Can Find Anybody,"I thought the book had some good reference material in it and I only learned 2 new things in it ,so overall it was a disappointment.I kept reading and thought that it will deliver more but it didn't."
4,"One of the more readable of Vidal's ""inventions""","This is a very enjoyable read from Vidal. A cult led by a charismatic figure may or may not be able to bring about the end of the world. This is a funny-and scary-novel. Vidal's dialogue is witty. His observations are dead on target. The story moves forward rapidly, with few of Vidal's usual tangential meanderings. This may be because Vidal realizes that he has a great story to tell or that he was writing with one eye on a film deal (In fact, it was once planned as a movie with Mick Jagger playing the role of the cult figure). Not to be missed."
5,Hah!,This is the first Gore Vidal book that I have read. A great book...made me laugh out loud so many times! Now I'm starting from the beginning to read all of Vidal's works.
4,Great book,"This was a really fun book. I have enjoyed most of Vidal's works, but this particular one stands apart. The plot and how it unfolds is just amazing. He hooks you very early on and refuses to let go. The more you read the more Kalki grows on you. Before you know it you are looking for your free lottery ticket as well.Any book that has a post-apocalyptic ending is great in my book, but the way that Vidal leads this story towards its conclusion and climax is superb. It reminds me of Vonnegut's Galapagos. There is a wit and a charm to this story that is uniquely Vidal.I want spoil the end (which makes talking about the book at all difficult), but I will say that it has the Vidal twist. There is no simple straight forward endings for this writer, and the reader will be glad for it. A great book that is wonderful throughout, and has a brilliant finally."
1,Disappointment,"Too slow to get started, takes too long to establish. May have been a great novel thirty years ago, but a bit slow for today's story narration structures."
3,an interesting look at Vidals spin on the 70's,"A mostly cynical look at the world of the 1970s. Kurt Vonnegut writing is more bitter but a lot more fun to read. The story is engrossing, and a pretty easy read. The plot twists are unlikely but fun. You can kind of see what's coming towards the end of the book... maybe because there have been so many of these doomsday stories through the years... but for the first two thirds of the novel, I had no idea where the author was headed."
4,Fantastic performance! Just a few problems:,"This is the dream cast for this opera! There is no reason why an opera this beautiful should be revived as little as it is. Even Strauss's own tyrannical wife approved of the closing scene: at the premiere, she leaned over out of her seat and gave a kiss to Bohm, the conductor (she said he only would get one because he was too sweaty).So what are the problems? The first is the recording technology of the time. The second is the fact that this is a live recording. Why all of Vienna had to attend the performance with the flu is beyond me. Still, this recording is worthwhile for the performers and the performance!"
1,By the Sword keeps you guessing!,"By the Sword is both thrilling and suspenseful. It kept me guessing all along as to how the story would unfold and brought me to tears a couple times. A real fan of Christian fiction which is both instructive and easy-going like some of Francine Rivers and Jan Karon, I found that By the Sword took off in 5th gear and kept me on edge. Even though this 'cliff-hanger' might be considered more of a man's book, as a woman, I still enjoyed it. It was fun reading about the different places in Switzerland that Mike Yorkey wove into the story. The scriptural teachings were simple, yet sound and the information on the religion of Islam, was extremely interesting. It helped me to better understand what is happening today and why. A good read...don't forget to 'buckle-up' when you start off. :)"
5,Exactly what I needed,"A friend gave me the Forerunner 205 and had lost the charger. This is exactly what I needed. I already had the power cord but if you don't, you'll need to buy one as this doesn't come with it."
3,"Works great, but....","This works great, but I would have thought buying a charger, the cord would have been included, rather than have to make a separate purchase (fortunately I noticed it was not included when I ordered it on the website, otherwise I would have been a little P.O.'d)"
2,GPS pops out,I would not buy this product again. It does charge my GPS but I have to put a rubber band around it get it to make contact.
4,Saved me a lot,"I was ready to buy a new Garmin 305 watch because my old one was not charging properly. i saw this in Amazon's inventory an decided to splurge on the $20 it costs to try to avoid the major expenditure. I received it and it works perfectly. my wife, the runner is happy. I am not happy. now I have to find another gift for my wife."
3,Works fine but is too expensive for what it is,"It is unfortunately that you have to use this cradle to sync your gamin device, it would be much easier to simply plug into the device itself. They over charge for this cradle, this should be more like a $5 item. I suggest if you are looking for a device like this you should get one where you do not need a separate cradle."
1,Garmin Charging cradle,I have never received this product although the company insists that I have - Therefore I really cannot give it a review. This needs to be resolved - I told them over a month ago that I had not received it.Garmin Charging Cradle for Forerunner 205 and 305
5,Works fine,Seems to be exactly same as the one that came with my Forerunner 205 and works the same. Seems to be perfect replacement
2,Dosnt stay connected,"I bought it. It looks and feels like the one I lost, but when you snap it in it does not stay attached. I managed to hold it on with a twist tie to charge, but its not as good as the original."
5,King of the low budget indies,"You have to like low-budget independent films to get into this film but it is a good one! The best description that I can come up with for Down Time is that it is like the film ""Clerks"" in prison. The film moves along in a docu-drama style driven by a surprisingly good ""grungy"" soundtrack. I really enjoyed this film but remember this is not ""The Rock"".Was this review helpful?[ Report Abuse ]"
2,LIKE A HAMMER TO THE GUT,"Down Time came recommended by a friend when I mentioned I've seen the Australian indie ""Chopper"" (one of the early works of Eric Bana and none too fascinating either.)Filmed in unmistakably low-fi B&W; tint, with a macho heavy-metal thrash soundtrack, the look and sound were clearly going for gritty. But along with the downbeat storyline, they just make sure that this attempted low-budget film is just that -- cheap.Cliches abound: violence, drug abuse, sheer boredom of an inmate's life. The shock or fear quotient is largely derived from disgusting moments from uninspired characters play-acting stuff like a high school drama.If you want raw, there's ""Romper Stomper"" with Russel Crowe. But this farce is a strictly skippable amateur effort that looks more like outtakes from a B film on some local channel."
2,Downer Time,"There are good movies and there are "" B "" movies. Seems there is new category,the "" D "" movies.Never judge the movie by it's cover,tough men surviving prison life.Seems it is tough men surviving the movie."
5,Premium food,"I have been using canidae for 5 years now along with nuvet vitamins and it has been a wonderful product. After the ingredients change I have not noticed any sort of change in my siberian huskies what so ever. They still have high energy, very lush coats,white teeth and great done density. I am very happy with this product i have had no problems!"
1,"New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good","This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it."
1,serious diarrhea - I would like to rate even lower,"I am very involved with dog rescue - in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards. We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters, but recently we (personally) have seen problems with our dogs', as well as dogs throughout the rescue, stools. We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced. I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again. It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product."
1,Lost a loyal customer- changed formula without notifying customers,My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.
1,Used to be an awesome food but they changed the formula. NO GOOD!,"This used to be a great food, but they've changed the formula and my dogs have suffered. Their customer service is very rude. My dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula. Explosive Diaherra, Vomiting, Fur became dull. Change it back Canidae!!!"
5,canidae review,This dog food is the food that the breeder uses for all her dogs both adult and puppies. We continued to feed our puppy Canidae when we got him and he is turning into a fine dog.Rod
2,Formula changes causing upset,"I have a rescued greyhound and he was doing great on Canidae until we got our last order just last month. Now he's a mess digestively. I'm on an email discussion group for greyhounds and have seen lots of complaints as well as confirmation that the formula has changed. Definitely not working for my dog anymore. Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for. I know everyone's hurting financially, but I think in this case the dogs got sold down the river for a few bucks. Disappointing."
2,worst food,"Would not recomend this food, my 3 chihuahuas,an 1 greyhound eat this food free feed, an have lost excessive weight. They eat & eat an still loose weight. My dogs are very healthy have been to vet, vet said its the food. I changed their diet an after only 1 wk have gained all the weight back they lost."
1,Beware the new formula!!!!,"I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half. My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded. However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!! I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before. Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it. Immediately her stools firmed up. Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick. I am done, I will no longer support Canidae. Do not buy it! Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there."
1,Canidae Dog Food made my dogs extremely ill,"I have relied on Canidae for my 4 dogs for over 3 years now. It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different. Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic. The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms. I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA. I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away. I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae. I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs. Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill. I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on."
1,Hot spots galore while on Canidae,"I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing."
4,good product,"I like this dog's food for my dog, it's high quality and not too expensive. I have to say though that the bag came all ragged and opened."
2,Dog didn't like the taste,"Started out OK, but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn't like the taste all that much, became picky and wouldn't finish her feedings. I ended up discarding a half-bag and switching to Wellness brand Puppy mix. Canidae does produce very dense, dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy. With a 1-acre fenced yard I don't bother."
1,Beware new formula!,"Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs. I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots. There are many, many complaints on the web by people with dogs having the same symptoms that finally stopped upon changing to another food. Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only). There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list. Do your homework before buying this dog food. Dog owners across the country have spent lots of money unnecessarily at the vets trying to find answers to their dogs medical problems only to find that it's the food they've been feeding. Used to be an outstanding product! Wish I could give zero stars!"
1,Great for Diarrhea and Making Your Dog Sick,"I've been feeding this to my dog for months and I have just realized his stool has been pretty runny the whole time, today he had diarrhea again, probably the second or third time during that period. I came online to see if others have been having the same problem as me, and sure enough the answer is yes. I'm done with this dog food, I'd suggest you do the same, it's just not right."
4,Canidae Dog Food,This is one of the best dog foods on the market. It saved me quite a bit of money to order it directly through Amazon rather than try to find it locally.
5,Even better than I was expecting...,"I was looking for Lola Albright's ""Dreamsville"" album on CD, which featured songs she performed on TV's ""Peter Gunn."" I can't find that on disc, but this one turned up and I took a chance on it. Boy, I'm glad I did. She's got such a smooth, sexy voice, and it's used to good effect here. She doesn't have the widest range, but she's quite a charmer, performing a mix of well-known tunes and songs that were written especially for her. All the selections are excellent, especially the opener, the delightful ""A Man, A Man, A Man."" The backing is the kind of light jazz/pop arrangements that Julie London often favored. But Lola is a better singer than Julie, with a silkier, more girlish voice. Definitely a lucky find!"
3,reviewer from dallas,i first heard joyce cooling on a contemporary jazz station on xm radio and really liked her so i got this cd--this girl's got to play. i really like the instrumental songs but the vocals are pretty weak--and there are four of them. she plays the guitar so well i don't know why she would want to cover up or detract from her great guitar playing. the other issue i had with this cd was there was nowhere on the outside that told you there were all these vocals. all i every heard on the radio was instrumentals and that is what i expected to get. if you like female vocalists you might like this one better than i did but i really prefer instrumental pieces.
4,"Very good CD, but....","I have all of Joyce's albums and I think ""This Girl's Got to Play"" is right up there with ""Third Wish"". I especially enjoyed ""Wizard"", ""Green Impala"" and ""Expression"". I was disappointed that she did not really show her guitar acumen on more of the tracks. However, I think most Cooling fans will appreciate this CD. Joyce, please on future albums, do what you do so well in concert, scat and play. Enjoy!!"
3,"Play, please don't sing.","This is my first Cooling purchase and I was not aware that she also sings. Or,attempts to. I understand why the only cuts I hear on the radio are instrumentals. The instumentals are decent, though not exceptional, smooth jazz offerings. I agree that the girl's got to play but, she should drop the singing or leave it to someone else."
2,Play but don't sing,"I have enjoyed Joyce's guitar playing for many years as a Bay Area resident, but I don't understand who told her she could sing. On past CD's there is one song with vocals and they are so bad I always skip over them. Unfortunately, this CD has at least 4 vocals, which makes it harder to skip. There really isn't anything else about this CD to set it apart from her previous 3. I say skip on this CD. Sorry Joyce."
4,Good Playing,"This is my first Joyce cd and it's pretty good! Great instrumental smooth Jazz, this cd is great for those nice long drives to the beach or park, Joyce has a pleasant voice, i think in the future she will be a seasoned vocalist, my favorites are 'Expression', ""The Wizard' and 'Talk'."
3,"Good, but definitely not the first choice","Levine's reading is admirable, with which I feel very satisfied. But what disappoints me is that the singers did not match up with their maestro. Take James Morris, for example. Act II of Walkure is so important that I can't believe the dramatic elements in it are missing through his rendering. Overall, this is a good set, but if you want to keep just one or two Rings, this should not be one."
2,A disappointing cycle,"I'm afraid I'm rather disappointed by this set. Levine and the Met orchestra are indeed admirable, although they surely don't erase memories of other great readings in the past. Most of the disappointment come from the singers. Goldberg is simply inadequate as Siegfried, Behrens is over-stretched (esp. in the final opera), Morris is dramatically dull. Most other roles are merely adequately taken, sometimes less so. No, I'd prefer many other cycles than this one."
2,Disappointing performance,"Frankly, the performance disappoints in many aspects. I have great reservations on Levine's plodding tempo, and the singing is generally much below expectations. Above all, the entire performance never manages to take flight, and it sound all so earth-bound. I don't think this can be a good introductory to the Ring."
4,a very pleasant ring indeed,"I saw this on offer when I was looking to buy a copy of Solti's recording. I bought the Levine 5 years ago and I have listened to it several times. Superb orchestration, Goldberg has a true heldentenor voice. You can understand every word too.I have seen live performances of die Walkure & Siegfried (SSO, at the Opera H). Behrens compares exceptionally well as a Brunhilde. This is a great recording, but I'm still buying the Solti as well! vive la difference!"
4,A noble effort but . . . .,"I bought this ""Ring"" after buying the Met's video of the live production hoping for the same, but oh well. Levine's conducting is brilliant & balanced, but the climaxs' really aren't that exciting, also it sounds like it was conducted in a vaccum. The cast is excellent, notably the Rhinemaidens; Morris is THE Wotan of course, and Behrens shines as Brunnhilde. The major flaw is Reiner Goldberg: he just doesn't sound heroic enough for Siegfried, and his voice isn't strong enough. Siegfried Jeruselem is given Loge's role. I thought that was an insult, him and Golberg should have changed places. Besides all that this is quite a notable recording, and I would recommend it if you've listened to others and made a sound choice."
5,Used Book like New,"Bought this used book and it said it was in ""good"" condition but it almost looked new. Maybe one person read it. Now marks no torn or missing pages, really good book."
3,good picture book,"Book has lots of good pictures to help you identify corals. IN this manner it can be used as a min-coral atlas.However, the book comes up seveley lacking when you wish to get information on said corals. All info is in bar graph form -- not narrative. A coral may be listed as preferring light 3-7.That is not helpful... 3 could mean keep it in the dark while 7 could mean it prefers direct light... the 3 and 7 are not informative! Same for feeding icons, coral placement icons, etc.If you want a book that TELLS you all about different corals, how you care and feed them, etc, then this book is NOT for you!BUT, the pictures are really nice, closeup, and clear."
3,"Excellent pictures, but not as much care content as desired.","This book has great pictures, with an excellent taxonomy of cnidarians, written by an author with both authority and experience in the subject. The book lacks, however, the basic and intermediate care descriptions that people would normally like for their corals. Best suited as an introduction to basic reef placement and coral identification. The lighting standards neglect to mention which corals are non-photosynthetic and which are photophobic, such as Nephthyigorgia."
3,Great pictures; awful writing,"The pictures throughout this book are fantastic. They are beautiful, clear and even illustrate the different appearances possible within the same type of coral. Sadly, though, the book is full of grammatical errors and awkward writing. One gets the sense the author was trying to write above his level with the help of a giant thesaurus and an overactive comma key. It is so bad, I found myself doubting the accuracy of the information. Hopefully, future editions of what should be a top-notch book will be more closely edited."
4,some poems reflect Dryden's take on key public issues,"Winn has gathered together a group of essays about the Middle English writer and poet, Dryden. All the essays presuppose that at the very least, the reader is well familiar with Dryden's best known works.One interesting analysis is offered by Harth, who describes how Dryden was acutely interested in the main public issues of his day. Harth shows how some of Dryden's poetry and writings and be usefully viewed in this light. And not just as abstruse declaimings. Some poems are overtly political, as Dryden was a public poet and sought to influence public opinion on various matters."
3,A barber without an edge,"As a steady JDF fan, I am always impressed with his singing.I also enjoyed his dance steps and comedy. He does not disappoint; however, I can't say the same about the rest of the cast. The production itself is not interesting. I will be looking forward to a Barber with JDF and a more excellent cast in the future, like the current production at Covent Garden (I know it's not being produced for DVD). I hope there'll be one."
5,Wonderful Opera,Purchased this for my Mom she loves juan diego florez and was not disapointed in this production.
4,Could have been higher rated but for Bayo and Spagnoli.,"This is a Madrid performance of Rossini's much performed opera.I have been given to understand that this is the complete version. Credit goes to the stage production and to those singers who gave the 'completeness' to the production, especially Florez.It could have been a perfect production if the Figaro and Rosina were not casted to singers who are much too mature for the role, compared with Juan's Count Almaviva.Spagnoli's Figaro lacked the mischievous light-heartedness required of the role, while Bayo is a strain both on the ears and the eyes with her dry and gritty tone and slightly over-aged appearance.Much more fun to watch the old DVD with Erika Koeth as Rosina, Hermann Prey as Figaro. Their duet at Act II were so funny and entertaining, as compared to what was presented here.This production is otherwise recommended, especially for those beginning to watch operas."
4,"Wonderful performance, with lackluster image quality","This is a wonderful performance, but the DVD suffers from an abyssmal video presentation. While the camera work is very good, and the image IS anamorphically enhanced (for widescreen televisions), it appears as though the image was cropped from a standard-resolution video master. As a result, there is considerable video noise and widespread (almost distracting) compression artifacts. On a large screen the video is almost unwatchable. Maybe I've been spoiled by opera DVDs made from high definition masters, but the video here is a major disappointment.I'd give a 5 for the performance and camera work.I'd give a 2-3 for the video presentation (it would be even lower if it was not anamorphic)."
3,"This recording is good, but ...","This recording is good but it lacks true capacity to get me excited. There are some passages in No 3 that should get the pianist first and then the listener very excited, and Mr Kissin does not impress me as anything other than technically sound but unfortunately very detached. Particularly the end bars. For true excitement he should listen to the late Terence Judd's live recording in Moscow, in the Chandos recording. Sorry. Mr Abbado, The Berliner and the 4D recording, on the other hand are superb."
5,Excellent for children and adults alike.,"My wife had read all of the Mitford books, so we decided to bring this book into our home. We had no idea what a great decision it would turn out to be! This is truly going to be a classic. I read it to my wife and daughter each night before bedtime. They both loved it. The characters are colorful, and jump off the pages into your heart. The pictures fit the text perfectly. My daughter said after seeing one of the pictures, ""Oh, that's what the owl looks like!"" It is also a chance for Mom or Dad to get those voice talents working. I have already purchased two more while they are still available. One for my daughter, my wife won't give hers up, and one for my 8 month old granddaughter so she can have it for this coming Christmas. Thank you Jan for a classic."
5,Jan Karon Does It Again!,"This tale of a stuffed bunny setting out to deliver himself to his new owner is wonderful! Jan Karon's writings are always warm and witty, and Jeremy is no exception. Adult readers will find much to smile about in this story, and children will be enchanted with the idea of a toy rabbit having an adventure on his way to a new home. The illustrations are beautiful, also, and add a lot to the tale. I thoroughly enjoyed this little book!"
3,Not that impressed,"I love books. I love children's books and love reading to my grandchildren. I must say that I was not all that impressed with this book. The physical look of the book is gorgeous. It is a high quality hardback with adorable, charming pictures. But I just couldn't get into the story line. I certainly don't see it in the same category as classics like Peter Rabbit and the Velveteen Rabbit. I bought it to read to my four and five year old grandchildren. I just can't see them sitting still for that whole story. I couldn't even get through it in one sitting myself. I think it is too long for a reading session for children who can't read yet and I don't think it would hold the interest of children old enough to read for themselves, so I'm not sure what the target age would be. I am obviously in the minority with this opinion, but as one who has read tons of books to my own children, as a substitute teacher and now as a Grandma;I think my opinion should carry some weight."
4,Good,It took a while to figure out to get on since we were frustrated before hand but it works. It's good. I recommend.
5,Finally!,ive wanted these boots for the longest time and i finally got them and i love them. the first time you wear them you'll have to adjust the laces and stuff but after that you can just zip them on and off. i love them.
1,No NHL Fighting,"This video is just like all the other lame hockey fight videos out there. No NHL fighting, only AHL and other farm teams. Quality of film is lackluster as well, not to mention the eighties music. Best part of the video is a fight by a young Eric Lindros, the rest is worthless."
3,"Good, but hardly great.","What makes this book an interesting read is the length of time Mr. Laurence was in Vietnam and the freedom he had to cover the war from it's inception through Tet and the Cambodian invasion into post-war Communism. He witnessed and reported admirably on most of the seminal events of the war. However, the book can hardly be called, as it is on it's back cover by the Boston Globe, ""Homeric"". It is too self-absorbed, and at times too catty :) to be called epic literature.Ironically, although Laurence seems almost Gump-ian in his presence at the major milestones of the war, he unfortunately missed the most successful strategy employed in the war. The Marine Corps' implementation of Combined Action Platoons (CAP), taken from their 1940 Small Wars Manual was successful but derided by Westmoreland as undoable. Laurence has nothing to say on this matter, and that is unfortunate. ..."
2,"a 300 page book ""packed into"" 850 pages","A very interesting perspective on the war that was somewhat enlightening, but highly redundant and self-indulgent.Getting through it was a painful slog."
4,"""The Truth will set you free. . .""","Frank Peretti did it again! He has created a masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. This book has a great message to it. Truth can't be taken out of society without lasting affects on people. Although I knew how the scientists were creating virtual reality, ... I had no idea why they were doing it. Although it is a little far-fetched, it is close to being believable. It isn't as believable as the first one, though, but that's okay. I read this whole book in nine hours. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the debates between Elijah and the counselor at the camp are fun to read. Keap up the good work, Frank Peretti!"
5,BES5 BOOK EVER,This is my absulute favorite book. It may be labled for kids but I believe all ages will adore this thrilling mystery.
3,"WELL---OKAY, I GUESS","AS I AM AN OLDER READER---AND---A PRETTY BIG FAN OF PERETTI'S---THIS WAS JUST OKAY.I, MUCH PREFERED """"HANGMAN'S CURSE"""" TO THIS. THIS WAS NOT AS MUCH OF A PAGE-TURNER.BUT--AGAIN---IT IS A PLEASURE TO READ A BOOK WITH NO SEX, SWEARING, ETC. I FELT THATTHE RELIGIOUS TONES / ASPECTS OF THIS BOOK WERE MUCH AMPLIFIED OVER """"CURSE"""".IT STILL WAS A PLEASANT READ."
5,"Great, a amazingly good book........","Its a shame how few good christian teen writers there are. I read alot so I should have a clue what I am talking about. And I think that this is incredibly good. All they need to do is make a movie about it , like Hangmans Curse. If you think this book preaches. It doesn't. I grew up in the church and I know what I am talking about. Unless your loking for the sermon, you won't feel preached. Enjoy the the book for what it is and read more Frank Peretti"
2,Not the best writing.,"If you have read This Present Darkness, The Oath, or even the first Veritas Project book, this is a disappointing novel. The print is 1.5 spaced, meaning lots of whitespace to make up for the minimalistic content. The storyline itself has a lot of interesting content, but just lacks the Peretti ""feel"" of the other books. If you really like Peretti, this is a good read if you just want to read something, but the ending is disappointing and I feel it could have been better to offset the lack of content in the main plot (which is really bizarre). This is what I would expect to see in a first draft of a Peretti book, not a ""best seller""."
2,boring,"This was one of the most boring books I've ever read. There were only a few good parts in the book, but the rest was dull. Better than 'Hangman's Curse' though."
3,a little surprised,"We purchased this with the set (car bed and toy chest). The cute, sturdy dresser holds his clothes ok for my 3 year old but, you have to go purchase baskets, else it gets messy. Not a dresser, more like a cabinet. Also it is bows on the top. The picture shows you can have decorations on top but I can't put anything on it except stuffed animals. I thought this would help him be able to easily get his clothes, but the handles are hard to open for a 3 year old and really just ackward in general."
4,Great little dresser!,"I think this was a cute addition to my 22-month-old's son's room. It is sturdy and it comes in one piece. You just have to put the stickers on any way you wish. I use it as his dresser, the top shelf I just stacked his undergarments and pajama's, and on the bottom shelf I put all his play clothes. The rest of his clothes I hang up, so I felt like there was ample room. I think it is great as a dresser for toddlers. As he gets older I will probably use it as a bookshelf/toy storage."
4,Really Nice,My Son's room is now complete. looks real cool and he can access his own things. I am happy that I bought it for his room.
4,What do you want it for?,"Make sure you ask yourself this question before you buy this item. It is really cute, but it is certainly not a dresser. It is a storage unit. It is small, a really good size for a small TV stand or a bedside table (especially if you have a big Little Tikes car bed.) There are 4 cupboard type doors that open to one compartment which is separated by one shelf about midway. It does not come with any bins to better utilize the space inside, so if you want to put anything that does not stack easily you may need to buy some containers. We are using it for a bedside table and will keep books, etc inside. It is well made, but the plastic top and shelf are not extremely flat. You can literally pull it out of the box and it is fully assembled, all we had to do was to put the decal stickers on. [...]."
3,Very Cute But Not Very Well Made.,"I thought this was the cutest thing to go with my sons car bed. We purchased and received by UPS. Hardly anything to assemble just put on the stickers and the ""rollers"" and you're done. Our middle shelf inside seems alittle messed up. Almost like something heavy was set on it and it drops down a little. Not flat but the top is fine and doors shut okay. I probably would have sent it back but my son would not have let it leave the house. My son loves it. I would purchase again. Very cute. We use it for toys not clothes. I wish I would have found it sooner."
5,Tool chest Dresser,I purchased this Tool Chest Dresser for my grandsons bedroom that is decorated in a Car Theme. It is so cute and holds a lot of his things. It can be used to hold clothes but he uses it to hold his toys.He is three years old and loves this thing and it looks so cute with his blue car bed. The dresser comes already assembled and all you have to do is put the stickers on. It is sturdy and well worth the money. Trust me you will love it.
3,Listen to the other reviews!!,"This box is very cheaply made as mentioned in other reviews. My son does love it though because it goes with his room and it looks like daddy's in the garage but honestly I would never buy it again for the price it is at. The quality of the plastic is cheap and some parts are actually already faded to a different color straight out of the box, I think for around $40 this would be an okay item but not for almost $90.00. Besides the cheap quality of material it is hard to open as there are no actual handles on it and when it is closed properly 3 of the 4 doors are usually pretty difficult to open. The 4th door is much easier because it never really closes completely. If there was something similar on the market this would be returned but there's not so I guess it will get the job done for now."
5,toy shelf,"This item is advertised as a dresser, but it is really a book or toy shelf with doors. It is sturdy. Holds a lot and is great for kids."
3,"Cute, but overpriced","Bought this for my 2-year-old's room to match his race-car toddler bed and provide some extra storage for his toys and books that will be accessible to him. I think it is overpriced for what you get, but it is cute. He will probably outgrow this and the bed within a couple of years, so I am not sure it was worth the value- unless I can re-sell it for 1/2 of what I paid for it."
4,Like it,When it arrived there were a few dents on top of the dresser. One part was dented enough to keep the top doors from closing properly. The dresser serves it purpose and my three year old loves it.
4,my grandson loves it,My son and daugher-in-law wanted this for my grandson for Christmas. They said it was easy to put together and my grandson loves it
3,Not really a dresser,We have had this for about 4 years now. We got it when my son was 1 and needed a dresser. I was excited because it would match the race car bed he had at the time. It worked as a dresser for maybe a year. I had to buy some if those cloth cube drawers to use in it. After that first year of use he out grew it for use as a dresser. It has made a great cabinet for toys though!
3,Good only for larger bike,These training wheels are are too tall for smaller 10-12 inch bikes. Unfortunatley that is not indicated on the package. Otherwise they look very study. We'll save them for the next bike. (My son is only 3).
1,Dissapointed in Jamaica,"I bought these training wheels to fit my daughters 20"" bike for Christmas. It does not fit. It only fits up to a 16"" bike. So my daughter could not ride on Christmas day and i had to purchase an additional pair. Please get your sizing right.Krys.....jamaica"
1,WORST PURCHASE EVER!,"Bought these to go on a Schwinn 20"" bike and they are just awful. They don't fit the bike, the wheels are rocky and bolts do not lie flush, we were missing two lock nuts in the package.Need I say more, very disappointing especially to the 7 year old whose new bike had to be taken to a bike shop and have new training wheels purchased and put on to the tune of $30!!!!"
1,Horrible,"Never again will I purchase a Proctor Silex product. My hand mixer I had for 13 years died on me and my daughter purchased the proctor silex. I was excited about the clip on holder for the cord and mixer blades. However, it was short lived after the mixer burned out the second time I used it (3 days after purchase)."
1,DO NOT buy this mixer - it broke the first time I used it,"I bought this hand mixer when my 30 year old stand mixer stopped working. The very first time I used it, I was mixing a small amount of cookie dough when it started smoking. I heard a pop and saw a spark, after that it just kept smoking for an hour, never worked after. Since it was still under warranty, I contacted the manufacturer to let them know what happened. They told me if I wanted a replacement I had to pay $10, which is almost the cost of the mixer itself. This mixer is NOT worth it."
3,Pretty good. The tiny box is slightly annoying though.,"This program does just what it says and works nicely. I think someone else mentioned this though, that the Window box that you work with on the screen isn't full size. It's rather small. However, forgetting that aspect of it, it works great and is sure to be more handy than grabbing a Dictionary on the desk. I'm hoping to utilize the Thesaurus part of it a lot too."
4,Rivals Karajan/Schwarzkopf and in Some Ways Better,"Boehm's Rosenkavalier with Ludwig et al. rivals that of Von Karajan with Schwarzkopf, which latter is generally (see, e.g. Penguin Guide to Compact Discs) regarded as the best recording yet. Actually, in some ways, the Boehm/Vienna Phil. is better. The reading is more precise, and some of the minor parts (I am thinking here, especially, of Anton de Ritter as the Italian singer, whose one solo brought me almost to tears) are exceptional. But we go on judging Rosenkavaliers by the famous trio in the final act, and I cannot prefer Boehm's Ludwig/Toyanos/Mathis to Schwarzkopf/Ludwig/Stich-Randall. Just as the Penguin reviewer suggests, the Karajan/Philharmonia will always rate ***** in my book."
5,"Excellent restaurant, now excellent book","The book is wonderful. The stories are hilarious, especially the Frank Sinatra ones, and the recipies are great. The stories are all true, and the people involved are all wonderful. Not only is the book great, the actual restaurant is much better. I love all the people there, and our family has been there many times. Hats off to the restaurant that was the best, is the best, and always will be, the best!"
2,too many fancy people but the recipes not good at all,i like the stories at the begining but the recipes were lame and not very enticeing the carmines cook book is much better and i think the price was much too high for what was mailed out to me i will have to rethink my future orders
3,Patsy's Cook book,"Nice assortment of easy to understand recipes, to much back rubbing with the rich and famous. Photo's of finished meal would be nice instead of the customers."
5,Simple Italian Cooking,"As an Italian American I recommend Patsy's cookbook because the recipes are easy to make. Sal's recipes for the most exotic Italian dishes are easy to follow with ingredients you usually have in your home. Most dishes can be prepared in 30 minutes with about 30 minutes cooking time. They are not only delicious, but also nutritous. I highly recommend this cookbook for busy people."
5,Mistaken Mom,"'It had been a dreadful shock to Caroline when her sister (Dorinda) disappeared, leaving her baby (Vito) with Caroline, but she vowed to herself she would do the best she could for the infant.So when the baby's uncle, Domenico Vicari, appeared, with an offer to marry Caroline and give the child a home and security, she felt she could not refuse. A condition of the marriage was that it would be in name only-but when Domenico had made it he had been under the impression that Caroline was the child's mother.What would his reaction be when he discovered how she had deceived him?'"
4,Good job !!!!,"Typical Gramophone production and sound quality! Seiji Ozawa and The Boston Symphony Orchestra produce exceptional work. Very lively and vivacious.Nice to have the complete work, but I will only listed to the non-narrated pieces in the future.Nothing more to add the previous reviewers have not already opined.Good day friends!"
5,I can't help but agree,"The above reviewers have pretty much said it all: this recording is certainly amazing in all respects. Judi Dench adds credibility and talent to the narration, while the orchestration and singing are simply marvelous. What we have here is:1) A great source text by Shakespeare.2) A great musical interpretation by Mendelssohn.3) A great performance of this headed wonderfully by Ozawa.You just can't go wrong buying this disc. 5 stars without the slightest doubt."
3,Utterly Confused,I was so confused throughout this entire book. I never knew who was on who's side. The different internal monologues were rambled and I was unsure who was talking and who wasn't. The ending is unsatisfying. I am not even sure I want to read the following two books in this series. This book is in general aggravating. I give it three stars for the interesting factual chapter at the end of the novel. Otherwise this book would get a 2.
3,Strangely incomplete,"I liked it, but felt as if I missed some thing Important to the storyline.I will need to reread this book."
5,Mystery Romance,Kathleen has done a superb job of adding a fictional story to the great historical cultures of the Native Americans. She has shown courage in being willing to add the romantic element. I look forward to reading her next work as it will use the power of sex to heal. The high chieftess trully exudes the stresses of leadership.
2,Confusing and not up to standard,"I hope I wasn't the only one who was totally and utterly befuddled by the end of this book. The characters were so marginal to Sora that when the plot twisted, I couldn't keep them straight, never mind who was on whose side. Glad I got this one from the library and didn't spend money on it...not up to the Gears' usual standard."
1,Boxes arrived opened,"In all fairness, this isn't a review of the film itself. I haven't taken any pictures with it yet. However, I ordered two rolls. Package arrived with the boxes open (open at both ends, and cut open, not torn). I don't feel very good about the expiration dates on the box being valid. Seems the canisters could contain just about any film stock. Not good."
1,all I can say is purple,I was finally going to shoot a roll of film after years of digital. Film has dimension that digital just does not. I though I would start with blackand white and play with some images so I was VERY disappointed to learn that when I took the film to the in for processing it cam out purple. The lab thinks it was heat damaged. It was still within date so they think it was improperly stored or handled. Very sad to lose all of those images.
4,Trustworthy,"I was a bit cautious when buying film off of amazon. So I only bought two in case there was a major issue, so I wouldn't waste too much money. But I was pleasantly surprised that this film worked out GREAT! I developed it myself in my schools dark room and there was no issue at all. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because when it came one of the boxes was open as if it may have been squished during transportation. But that's why we put film in containers! That didn't cause any problems. Although I see the price has gone up on here since I ordered I highly recommend this film!"
5,Ilford,Fast delivery. I used this film in one of my older cameras and the results were great. I did have to send it out through the mail to get it deveolped but that is understandable today.
4,For small players!,These mouthguards are are really small - they fit my 6 and 8 year olds. Good price. We bought the bunch for the coach to keep on hand.
3,The sum of its parts do not equal the whole work,"Three PURE AND SIMPLE songs stand out: ""Consumed,"" ""Activity Grrrl"" and ""As I Am."" The rest of the electric guitar-laden songs seem to blend together, making for an enjoyable listen. P.S.: In a world where the likes of Shania Twain and Mariah Carey depend as much on their great looks as they do on their music, bravo to Joan Jett for the semi-nude, tee-hee PURE AND SIMPLE cover shot, where she does nothing to fox up her plain-jane appearance. Take Joan, as she is."
3,Joan Jett - 'Pure And Simple' (Warner Brothers),"I'm sort of amazed at how LONG former Runaway Joan Jett's career has actually lasted,and it's still running.Playing basic three chord rock&roll with sultry vocals apparently still have a call for it.I'm not complaining,I mean 'Pure...' is a decent CD,I thought.Tunes here I liked best were ""Eye To Eye"",""Go Home"",""Insecure"",""You Got A Problem"" and the a couple of tracks she penned along side with producer Desmond Child ""As I Am"" and ""Brighter Day"".If you're a major Joan Jett fan,you should enjoy this release.If you happen to be a new fan,start with 'Bad Reputation' then work your way forward."
5,Her Absolute Best,"If you look up rock-n-roll in the dictionary, Joan Jett's picture should be next to it.... This is an amazing collection of her best tunes, all written by her. It runs the span of her tastes and abilities. From the catchy top 40 sound of EYE TO EYE to the punk sensibility of SPINSTER. If you love rock-n-roll then this is the perfect disc for you. You get the straight ahead 3 chord style that Jett has made her signature and throws in a few surprises. Hold on, you are in for quite a ride and a total treat!"
5,Creative songwriting,"This is another great album of Joan Jett. Her songs are getting more and more personal. There are many songs on it that I love: ""Eye To Eye"", ""Torture"", ""As I Am"", ""Wonderin'"" and ""Brighter Day"". The last one is one of the most touching songs of all that I know! There are also songs on this album that I don't like so much. ""Spinster"" doesn't feel good to me. And in ""Insecure"" words and music don't fit together; I would prefer to hear the same music with another text and the same text with another music. Yet I give five stars to this album, because it is Joan Jett, and that is good!"
4,track listing,"""Go Home"" (Jett, Kathleen Hanna) - 2:42""Eye To Eye"" (Jett, Kenny Laguna, Jim Vallance) - 3:30""Spinster"" (Jett, Kathleen Hanna) - 2:44""Torture"" (Jett, Kenny Laguna, Jim Vallance) - 3:35""Rubber & Glue"" (Jett, Kathleen Hanna) - 3:19""As I Am"" (Jett, Desmond Child) - 4:35""Activity Grrrl"" (Jett, Kathleen Hanna) - 3:45""Insecure"" (Jett, Kenny Laguna, Jim Vallance) - 3:11""Wonderin'"" (Jett, Kenny Laguna, Jim Vallance) - 4:53""Consumed"" (Jett, Thommy Price) - 4:40""You Got A Problem"" (Jett, Hanna, Desmond Child) - 3:57""Brighter Day"" (Jett, Desmond Child) - 6:06""World Of Denial"" (Jett, K. Aaronson) - 4:14 (Japanese Pressing, VICP-5396)""Hostility"" (Jett, D. Sparks) - 3:37 (Japanese Pressing, VICP-5396)"
4,Great album!,"The title of the album is exactly what it is. This album is WILD!!!!! Nothing held back. My favorite song on here is Brighter Day... a very true and touching song that makes people think about the issues in the world. I also love Hostility, Activity Grrrl, and Wonderin."
5,The Two Ages of Merle,"There are two Merle Haggard's. Merle the younger and Merle the Elder, withtwo quite different voices both equally plesant to listen to. Merle the younger sings a bithigher and always returns to his favorite phrasing. Merle the Elder has a bit deeper range andmore variety in style. Both Merles are great listening and I listen so much I am now comfortable signing Merle songs at local Karaoki bars. This album is Merle the Younger and I recommend it strongly i you like Merle at all.I've heard Merle now lives in the Redding area for the fishing. So if you are out fishing sometime and hear an old fisherman humming Merle tunes it might just be Merle."
3,We're Bar Room Buddies (and that's the WORST kind!),"First off... Bar Room Buddies was originally released in 1980 on the Elektra label, not Capital. And the soundtrack was not ""Any Which Way You Can"", it was ""Bronco Billy"".I own the vinyl soundtrack, cassette, and the promo 45 single (B/W The Not So Great Train Robbery).Capital could've remastered this song and got rid of the pops and scratches, better yet remaster it off the analog cassette, which would've sounded a whole lot better.I was able to remaster it myself from my cassette tape soundtrack, which came out like a champ and way better than the Capital release, and it only took a minute to do!Capital Records... SHAME ON YOU!!!Everything else on this compilation is great (including Bar Room Buddies if it only sounded great), and good selections."
2,Barroom Buddies is off vinyl!,"The hard to find duet ""Barroom Buddies"" with Clint Eastwood from the soundtrack of Any Which Way You Can is taken from VERY poor quality vinyl for this collection. Shame On You Capitol Records! Although this collection is issued by Capitol Records, I have a sneaking suspicion that many of the songs here that were originally released on Capitol are rerecorded versions. Can anybody verify this? The Sony titles are definetly the originals (tracks 9-20 on disc 2)."
5,A Must Have For the Merle Haggard Fan,"Excellent selections and a good quality cd. If you are going to own anything Merle Haggard, this is the cd to go with."
2,Misrepresented?,"Seller was a fast shipper, but the picture and the BOLD product description indicated this product was original sewries 1. I ordered it and recieved series 3 world of cars product which made it not a good deal.After receiving my order I looked again at this site and saw in SMALL print at the bottom of the page that the product could vary in series. It was my fault for not carefully reading the entire page, I felt the picture and BOLD description was very misleading.Tony Arden..Lenoir City, TN"
4,An extraordinary glimpse into Michigan's distant past.,"This book is for anyone who has wondered at the origins of a Petosky Stone or counted the layers in a cut of sedimentary rock. Holman wraps the most interesting aspects of geology, geography, paleontology, and anthropology into a single comprehensive picture of ancient Michigan, readily understood by anyone with interest. Coral reefs, 30 million years of tree growth with no animal intervention, and giant land tortoises all share a common history in Michigan. Holman takes you back, way back, and then just like the sedimentary rocks of the Great Lakes Basin, builds layers of interesting and entertaining information as you journey forward in time. Read this book, and I guarantee that the next time you climb Castle Rock or hear the call of a loon, you will be filled with just a bit more awe."
4,Look and features are good; a few minor flaws.,"The look of these is very modern, and the features very nice. Dimming and lighting works fine, and the remote control is very useful. You are also able to program it into any programmable remote.Two things that could be better...1) all of them use the same infra-red frequency. This means you can't have 2 or 3 lights in the same room on different remotes (we had hoped to program 2 different ones into our programmable remote, one for my side of the bed, one for my husband's.)Second, they will only work with standard bulbs; it does not work with energy saver bulbs."
4,Very good dimmer switch,"The Lutron dimmer works. I love the ability for remote control. The remote sensor could be a little more sensitive as sometimes it doesn't pick up the command from the Harmony One. The switch is not in line with the home theater equipment; so not the fault of the remote. The only caveat is a person who installs this should be familiar with tools and electrical work. If not, have a professional install it."
5,GREAT Show-Great DVD,Love everything on Little House...Great Moral Values! I have never gotten tired or watching Little House...over and over and over...great stories with good moral values.
1,Is it possible to give a movie 5 negative stars?,"Joel Schumacher could have gone on to cure cancer, bring peace to the Middle East, and end world hunger. I would STILL hate him for this turgid hackwork. This gets a two-disc special edition? What kind of masochist would order that?"
2,Bad Bad Bad!,"This was bad it wasn't the tim burton style. this movie wasn't dark, He did not have a partner in 1,2, the batmobile didn't change, now look he has a different face what happened to Michael Keaton.I'm telling you Val kilmer doesn't suit batman Michael Keaton suits it. And one thing they are trying to make batman a sex symbol for batman forever and batman and robin he is not. Joel Schmacher the director of this and batman and robin he is not creative like tim burton. some parts in this film were ok but other parts were bad. Joel Schmacher did a terrible job for this and batman and robin. Batman forever and Batman and robin are not connected to batman and batman returns.This movie wouldn't be good in your collection."
1,batman never forever,"riddle me this, riddle me that, whos afraid of the big black bat. Everyone should be be because this movie blows, i mean whats the point of Val Kilmar being batman, he is the worst of them all. I think the only could thing about this movie is that there are some funny parts but the rest might as well be riddles that someone should flush down the toliet, cause thats how bad this movie is. Oh and no one has ever made easier riddles than jim carry in this movie."
5,Reviewer: Big Zach NOT A KIDS REVIEW although I am a kid!,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ilove this movie so much it is the 2nd best batman and superhero movie ever! It's not as good as batman begins but still incredibly Awesome! Val kilmer is the 2nd best batman (besides Bale of course) But he was still great! This is a very dark movie. Idont know why people are saying that it was colorful like Batman and Robin. It is Packed with Action and a awesome soundtrack may not be as good as Elfmans music but still Great! Now we move onto more actorsJim Carrey: Great (as usual) He was excellent as the Riddler!Nicole Kidman: Wow:Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Hot! She is one of my favorite actors/Actresses and this is one of ther best performances!Tommy Lee Jones: He Was Aesome they could not have picked a greater Two-face This is his greatest performance. This is One of the top eight movies I have ever Seen in my life!
1,garbage!,I thought this movie was garbage. Tommy Lee Jones was not needed in this movie. He was more of a nuisance than a villain. His attempt to play a villain was awful. The only good actor was Jim Carrey.
5,VERY VERY GOOD,"3rd film in hit series. Joel Shumacher does fine job of directing. Val Kilmer takes over role from Michael Keaton and delievers SPECTACULAR performance. Chris O'Donnell swell as ""ROBIN"". Nicole Kidman fine in role. Jim Carrey & Tommy Lee Jones BOTH FANTASTIC role of ""RIDDLER"" and ""TWO-FACE"". 5 STARS once again."
5,Best Batman Movie!,"Batman Forever is one of my favorites.The other batman movies with the joker,the peguien, and catwomen were ok and batman & robin was alright but none of the villians measured up to the one's in batman forever. Val Kilmer played batman perfectly, Tommy Lee Jones played the cold harded two face brilliantly,Jim Carrey was halirious as the riddler, Nicole Kidman played the beautiful chase merridian and Chris O'Donall was a good choice to play robin. Overall,This is the best batman movie from the '90s."
4,Batman Forever.........,"""Batman Forever"" seen alot of changes made to the film series. First off, directorial duties were handed over to Joel Schumacher and the cowl of Batman was passed on to Val Kilmer. The film also marked the debut of Robin into the series(who, believe or not, Current Batman Begins star Christian Bale tried out for). This time around, Batman goes after the likes of Two-Face and The Riddler(played by Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey). While the movie is much more lighthearted in tone than anything that came before it, it was a great third installment, in my opinion. Val Kilmer did an excellent job as Batman/Bruce Wayne, playing it just as Michael Keaton had."
3,MIND NUMBINGLY ENTERTAINING,"Joel Schumacher is the wrong guy for the job, but this third film in the series is ok, due to the fact that it was still trying to stay true to the spirit of Tim Burton. Kilmer is an acceptable Batman, and Nicole Kidman has never looked better. Chris O'Donnell is good as Robin, and the Special Effects are well done. Jim Carrey scores as the Riddler, but the film's greatest flaw is the treatment of Two Face. The most tragic of all Batman villians, he is turned into a clown here. Tommy Lee Jones is a fine actor, and he could have played the part of Two Face as envisioned by creator Bob Kane. Instead, Schumacher(and the script) turn him into nothing more than a goon, a henchman for the much brainer Riddler. Also, Eliot Goldenthal's score is acceptable, but nothing compared to the operatic, Wagnerian music of Danny Elfman in the first two films. Pretty good, but not to be compared to the first two films(though better than the disaster that was to come)."
2,Expensive nightmare,"Friends, this Batman film, in addition to leaving you feeling depressed and extremely overstimulated, is quite badly edited. This becomes important during crucial action scenes, when the cuts happen so fast that they don't reveal what is actually happening. As with all sequels to the first Batman film, this one is burdened with too many characters."
3,Decent movie but not believable,"BF is a decent movie but some of it is not credible like how can the Riddler construct a death trap hideout with riddler bombs and his own version of Battleship with out alertling anyone and all his costumes, he had like 6 costumes in this movie but i still always enjoy the villains acting better then Batmans, i like the villians more.It bothers me that Batman never layed a hand on Riddler and Two Face, even though they were trying to steal his identity. They got alittle fancy with bATMAN facing his enemies in this movie, in the first two movies ,Batman killed the enemies by kicking their asses, in Batman forever, Batman desrtoys the enemies by throwing a batrang at The Riddler's parachute thing and killed Two Face by throwing coins downward and Two Face fell trying to catch the coins, if i were Batman, i find their wussie asses and beat the life out of them, the villians got off easy in this movie."
4,Tim who?,"Tim Burton's dark, dim version of Batman never came close to the Batman Bob Kane created.Now with Burton out of the picture viewers can come to know the story of the Dark Knight.With Robin by his side, Batman is battling Mad Criminals like Two Face and The Riddler.All the bat-gadgets and bad puns are back as they should be. This is a fun feel good movie!It's the real Batman!"
1,one god awful star.,"Here is my review as intelligent as this movie.If you think this movies great, Your brain is full of doody!Love, the Riddler."
3,More Heroes please,"It is said of this film, that people watch Batman for the villians. However, I found Val Kilmer's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman to be one of the better performances of the Dark Knight. Yes jim Carey as the Riddler was astounding, howver lets not forget that it is a batman film, not a villian peice."
2,Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones saved this movie,"Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones were the only two things that saved this movie from being a total disaster. While Val Kilmer may have looked better for the part of Wayne, that was the only good thing about him. Kilmer, O'Donnel, and even Nicole Kidman simply didn't work for this movie. there was no chemistry between any of them. Jim Carrey was the obvious choice for the Riddler, and he was histerical. And although I was a bit surprised at the casting of Tommy Lee Jones for Two-Face, he did a brilliant job. He has a real flair for playing psychotic. Those two were the only things that saved this movie from being a total disaster, and frankly, if they had cut out all other scenes and just shown the scenes with those two in them, I would have been happy."
1,EYE CANDY FOR THE ADD-AFFLICTED,"Oh, my God--what happened! I guess Joel Schumacher heard all the complaints that Tim Burton's Batman was too dark, so he went in the completely opposite direction--flashy, gaudy and campy! Is Joel suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder or something because not a moment goes by in this film without someone: screaming, yelling, shrieking, giggling, punching, jumping, swinging, grabbing, snarling, whining, crying, wailing, falling, climbing, sneezing or farting. There's just too much happening in this film all of the time. This production is just one big homage to La Cage Aux Folles! It's just one histrionic movie, man! As for Batman himself--sorry, Val, I love ya and all, but you just didn't do it for me. That's my verdict regarding BF; but your kid might like it, though."
5,Jim's Madness,"There is no subsitute for the madness that Jim Carrey manages to bring out in the suit of the Riddler. Jim at his best. Though, he's given us BEST many times. One of the MOST TALENTED actors of all TIMES!The movie? Well, it's Batman, so forget the plots. Enjoy the colors, motion and special effects. Batman is Batman. It's not Shawshank redemption. So don't expect, plots, dialogues and monologues. It's Batman! When you go see or buy a movie like this, forget plots and well-written dialogues. If they come, consider them as a BONUS."
1,an insult to the great burton/keaton films,"this movie is terrible, a stupid lighthearted awful movie that i really feel is a waste of time and money. two face is a joker ripoff, and the riddler in this film makes me appreciate frank gorshin. kilmer is awful as batman, robin is annoying as usual, stick with batman returns, anything after is garbage.nyc"
2,Why did they ruin this series?,"Ok first off all kids don't belive this Zack reviewer on any movie.Zack you call this the second best batman?! THis byfar is not the worst but is no where near the quality of Tim burton or Chris nolan's films. Joel Schumacher tried to make this a comdey action and ended up ruinning the series. Val Kilmer also is not the 2nd best batman his the 3rd best(Keaton being first, Bale being second, clooney being worse .Zack is to young to know the quality of good movies.All these kids only care about the movie having action. Do yourself a favor and watch the first two and batman begins(Zack if you watch the first two movies you will call them bad because you don't understand the concept of movies without special effects. Anything without them two you are bad probably).P.S. Zack you are grade A retard."
2,"Schumacher takes the ""Dark"" out of ""Dark Knight"".....","I know when you watch a movie,you're supposed to temporarily suspend belief, but how in the world did Harvey Dent turn from Billy Dee Williams Jr in the first Batman movie to Tommy Lee Jones in this Batman movie. It would've been interesting to see Billie Dee as Two-Face, just like Michael Clarke Duncan played the Kingpin in the Daredevil movie.One Last Thing--I hate to admit,but Schumacher had to play these Batman movies light,flaky and campy as long ws Robin was in them. In the comics and cartoons, Batman's character is so dark grim and moody, Robin has to make ""light"" of everything to ease the tension and make Batman not look [so uptight]! Without Robin, you can make Batmn psychologically grim, moody, and completely obsessed with fighting crime! That still doesnt excuse Schumacher from ruining Batman the way Adam West and Burt Ward did....."
2,"This one killed the ""Batman"" movies!","I loved the original ""Batman"" film(1989), and enjoyed ""Batman Returns"" (1992) even more. Now they just HAD to do a sequel with cheesy special effects, bad acting, and barely any action at all! Val Kilmer just doesn't have the good ol' touch to be the Gotham hero compared to Michael Keaton, the BEST Batman of them all! Skip this one along with ""Batman & Robin"", for they both seemed to have killed the series. See the first two instead, they are true classics than this mess!"
2,Bad Movie But DVD Is Improved,"This Batman movie is one of the worst Batman movies. Although The movie suffers from a super silly feel, I still think it might be better than the melodramatic Batman Begins. Val Kilmar is the worst Batman ever. Not bad special effects in this 90's movie. The Batman franchise died with this movie. The only two good batman movies are Batman and Batman Returns. Although this movie stinks, it has good special features. Music videos, making of docs, interviews, dleted scenes: it has all the works. I would pick it up only if you are a huge Batman fan and want to add it to your collection but otherwise I would just save my money."
2,Not better than Batman Return,"Batman Return was a far better movie than Batman Forever Batman forever was like watching a two hour cartoon show val Kilmer was okay as batman but Jim carrey was good as the riddle but tommy lee jones sucks as two face best part of the movie was The showdown Between Batman, The riddler so rent this okaymovie but Batman Forever is a better movie Than Batman and Robin Batman and Robin sucks i hpoe tthe new Batman movie is going to be good"
1,Joel Schumacher undoes all of Burton's good work and makes Batman camp again,"Oh my GAWD. Not surprised I didn't remember seeing this when it came out, but can't believe I didn't remember how gawdafully terribly bad it BLOWS. Schumacher did, indeed, destroy the Batman franchise do badly I'm surprised it ever recovered. Inexcusable nipples on the Batsuit. You'd think Batman raped Schumacher's mom while Robin kicked his dog, what he's done to these characters. Painful to watch, should only be considered if you want to punish yourself for (substantial) sins committed. Campy and corny are fine, but, jeebus, do it on your own dime, man..."
2,Oh no.....,"What is this?? What's with all the Neon and cheesy, campy lines?? It feels like we're going back to the Adam West days! (NOW, that's a bad thing, but back THEN thats how the comics were). With lines like 'Chicks dig the car.' and 'I'll get drive through' right after we've gotten Tim Burton's masterpieces it makes one feel woozy. This movie is a prime example where the merchandise is better than the movie (Batman and qustion mark symbol glass from McDonald's, anyone?). It gets worse (Batman and Robin) before it gets better (Batman Begins). Bob Kane must be thrashing in his grave."
1,"WORST ""Batman"" movie ever!","Strikingly cheesy dialogue, lousy acting, amateurish fight scenes that look like they came from some 1970s TV movies, a bloated and schizoid script that bounces all over the place---Joel Schumacher has made what is by far the worst Batman movie in history!What a shame to waste a fairly decent cast: Nicole Kidman, Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey...why on earth they'd cast Chris O'Donnell as ""Robin"" (other than to attract pubescent girls) boggles the mind, this kid couldn't act his way out of a paper bag!I rented this movie because I wanted to test out a new subwoofer in my home theater system, thank God I didn't buy it.Especially watching the latest installment, the excellent ""Batman Begins""---the sheer incompetence displayed in every aspect of ""Batman Forever"" is just appalling."
1,schumacher = hack,"This movie's worth can be gathered from looking at the box; notice how many faces are on there (five). That's exactly how this movie plays out, like five stars trying to get their shots in. Kilmer didnt seem that bad nor did Kidman, but I don't want to watch a movie featuring the joker and two-face. The series is based on Batman but I felt that Batman is a side-note in films 3 and 4. Films 3 and 4 just prove how much of a genius Tim Burton is."
2,I hate Joel Schumacher,"This is the start of the ruination of the Batman series. Joel's Batman was more concerned with nipples on the batsuit and driving up buildings than actually producing anything near an enjoyable movie. Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones are so pitiful as villians that there performances make me physically ill. Damn this movie to hell. If you can believe it, Batman 4 was even worse than this."
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!,"I don't know if Burton was on something when he let Schumacher mess around with the story. Hold on, wasn't Burton a producer? Why didn't he exert a little more control over the story? Batman is crazy, but he is not on acid! What was up with all the neon nonsense? Gotham is a dark city. Burton captured it well the first two times. Why did Schumacher feel the need to royally screw up! This is a big disappointment to me because Batman happens to be my favorite hero. Why did Burton agree to Schumacher's ideas? If you're a Batman fan, DON""T WATCH IT! DON'T EVEN REMOTELY THINK TO BUY IT! IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"
3,The Other Side of the Coin...,"I'm really sorry to hear everyone blasting this movie so badly. When it comes to the Batman series I believe the dark style of the first Batman was a better choice, but you need to drop that and go from dark to just plain fun! This movie to me was a return to the craziness of the original TV series. I liked this version because it was something other than rehashing the first movie. I was a big fan of the original TV series and I liked to see the cast having a good time playing some really wacked out characters again. Jim Carrey was a real hoot as the riddler. And Tommy Lee Jones, rather than try to show up Carey's craziness, opened up a darker, more serious version of the much-disturbed TwoFace. This movie is a roller coaster of a good time filled with craziness - so what else would you expect from a storyline about two men in rubber suits and capes who run around in lit-up vehicles saving Gotham City? Take a silly pill and just enjoy it!"
3,Batman Forever,"Better than Batman and Robin, but the Christopher Nolan trilogy is the way to go when it comes to Batman movies."
3,Val kilmer as Batman WTF,Good movie. Val Kilmer is allright as Batman. But the real draw is Chris O'donnel as bat boy and tommy lee jones as Two Face
5,One of the serie's best!!!,"This movie feautures a whole new look at the Batman saga,balancing Burton's vision with Schumacher's.From my opinion it's far better then BATMAN RETURNS,but better then BATMAN & ROBIN as well.The action is great too,at least for a mid 90's movie.I also think that the fans overeacted at the scene with Batman's butt-I don't believe that it was mean as a ''sexy scene'',but just a scene to show Batman's new suit."
2,Half right half Crap,Burton did not direct this film instead the flash and dash camera work of Schumacher was used.... Schumacher wanted to shake up Burton's vision and in doing so he overdosed on cod pieces and colors and kilmer is actually good but Kidman is more cold and wooden than an icy. Carrey is the saving grace of the film until his over the top performance gets old and its revealed he has absolutely no material to work with! A really bad film.
3,"Entertaining, despite flaws","Joel Schumacher takes over the Batman franchise in this episode in which Batman takes on the Riddler & Two-Face, while taking on a crime-fighting partner in Robin. Despite the brighter colors and air of campiness, there are enough dark moments to make this a fun film. Val Kilmer is a solid Batman, while Jim Carrey channels Frank Gorshin in his take of the Riddler. Chris O'Donnell has the right attitude as Robin. Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face is completely underdeveloped, while Nichole Kidman is just there for decoration. Unfortunately, Schumacher would completely abandon Batman's dark elements and create a disaster in the film after this...BATMAN & ROBIN. That said, this particular film is entertaining, despite it's flaws. Recommended"
3,It's okay,"Batman Forever features a solid cast and a semi mediocre plot. Jim Carey does what he can as a villain dressed in a Greenman with black question marks on it costume. Val Kilmer I feel did a descent job as Batman, but unfortunately is not welcomed back for the next one.This is probably one of the better older Batman movies, since it isn't so dark and doesn't include any Arnold Schwarzenegger one liners."
4,"Good, but not good enough","This was an above average movie, but could have easily been the best of the Batman series. I have a few problems with this movie. One: NIPPLES ON THE BATSUIT. What the ... was that there for? Two: TWO-FACE'S CHARACTER. They should have used the black and white suit from the cartoon instead of a red and white zebra suit, with an leopard tie and spiked shoes. It's just too colorful, which leads me to three: TWO MUCH ... COLOR. What was Gotham supposed to be, Las Vegas? Note the word ""goth"" in Gotham. And also, there was never a clear sky day in the previous movies, why was it that way in this one? Finally: THE MOVIE WAS JUST PLAIN SILLY. Cartoon sound effects? The childish dialouge? The villians' insane, forever lasting laughter? And what was with those 1940's cars and music? This movie should have been the best yet Batman but instead slides in at #3. But compared to the next Batman this one is ""The Empire Strikes Back""."
2,An embarassment to all involved.,"I'm giving this two instead of one star because Nicole Kidman is in it, but even SHE couldn't bring any life to the insipid script, contrived scenes, and lackluster characters. The best character in the whole schlocky mess is Alfred, and it probably would have IMPROVED this wretched movie if he made like the old TV show and put on the Batsuit.The attempt to combine gothic noir with headache-inducing flashiness AND grade-school humor fails miserably, but I ask you, what ELSE would result from such an idiotic combination, and in an ACTION movie no less?!What a terrible, terrible movie. I think it managed to barely be better than Batman and Robin, but that's not even an accomplishment, more a necessary law of nature..."
2,"Um, Batman's not cross-eyed.","At this point, I began to wonder why I bothered, so I skipped it. My brother rented it one night. So I watched this ominously titled film. It is horrible. The script is awful, the performances are just as bad as if Burton was directing it, and the cinematography, while interesting, is intrusive and obnoxious. It is impossible to follow the badly-staged action scenes. Jim Carrey in particular is really, really bad. It introduced the benightedly bad Chris O'Donnell as Robin. So why in the hell does it get the highest rating of the series? Because I enjoyed it. Somehow, all the horribleness of it came together for an entertaining movie. It is also the shortest (oddly enough, the other three are all the exact same length...). The big question is why in the hell did they lose the Batman theme, the best part of the previous films?"
3,It Has Potential!,"This film was great with one minor and one major flaw. The minor flaw was having Val Kilmer playing Batman. He's not the right person to play such a popular character. And the major flaw was including The Riddler in this film. Adding in a great Batman villain, but who acts like a 4 year old. I believe that this role for Jim Carrey lowered his career a bit. He was like a bug the you wish would just go away. I believe that this movie was good enough with Tommy Lee Jones playing as Two-Face. Now that he was fun to watch.I would give this film a much better rating only if The Riddler was not in it, but because he is, he ruined most of the movie."
3,Good sequel saves the series...,"Val Kilmer is Batman in this third entry into the successful series. The Riddler is wreaking havoc on Gotham City and it's up to Batman to save the day. Chris O'Donnell plays Robin and joins a reluctant Batman in bringing down Riddler and Two-Face. Director Joel Schumacher makes ""Batman Forever"" a bright, stylized comic-book movie and succeeds for the most part. Tommy Lee Jones is silly as Two-Face and Jim Carrey is goofily over-the-top as the Riddler. Hold on to your bat-seats, fans. This is a good one!"
2,Jim Carrey is OK rest of the movie is trash.,"I enjoy Batman movies Batman 1987,Batman begins, Dark Knight,... but this movie well it sadly got worse with the next installment don't waste your hard earned on this garage. Really stupid story-line."
3,Mediocre at Best - the Beginning of the End,"This movie began the descent part of the Batman arc or dive. Even though Bob Kane himself said that he always pictured Bruce Wayne as portrayed by Val Kilmer, the film as a whole did not carry a whole lot of appeal. Chris O'Donnell, while doing a fine job as Robin, reminded me more of Jason Todd than Dick Grayson.I enjoyed Gotham much more as Tim Burton's dark vision rather than Joel Schumacher's Neon Funland.The movie carries on the mythology with the introduction of Robin, but sets the premise for the subsequent failure of ""Batman and Robin."""
1,the worst batman film,i actually hate this even more then batman & robin to be totally honest. Atleast from beginning to end we all saw a camp train wreck with no plot; so it can be laughed at the for the camp classic that it is. Batman Forever masqurades as a good film but falls so far short that it earns much more of my hatred. there's just so much too hate about this film. first off lets get one thing straight...Jim Carrey is just awful as the riddler shouting and mugging through the movie. TLJ is just as bad as TwoFace laughing and screaming. Nicole Kidman is horribly miscast as bruce waynes love interest. Joel Schumacher seems to be obssesed with beauiful women then actually above average ones that are better suited for the part. the music was also horrible loud and annoying. funny enough Kilmer and O'donnel are the only actors who adds a sense of seriousness too the movie. in the end you will see a movie that had poteintial but in the end comes crashing to a big terd.
1,wasted movie,"The main reason i came to hate this movie was because of two face.don't get we wrong i think tommy lee jones is a grate actor could have made this role his best.but instead they made him to a joke. To me he was alway the best of the batman bad guy, never good nore evil but both. Not only that he had been at one time brue's best friend. which meant that it wasn't easy for batman to fight him.In this movie we see nothing of this. The part good part bad story is forgotten. In one part two face kept tosing his coin untill he got the side that he wonted. the bad one, the whole pont of the coin was becuase he could not make up his mind.Batman on the other hand seems to have no troubal beating up his one time friend, in fact the only time it there past is brought up is by two facs at the very end and then it's only for a second. As for the rest of the film it looks as if the makers were on LSD or something."
1,Disappointed,This movie was disappointing but almost all sequals that I have seen are. I always wonder why they don't use the original actor(s).
1,Worst Batman Movie I've Seen,"I began watching the Batman series starting with Tim Burton's 1989 film. The first two films were excellent, full of layered characters, surprisingly good dialogue, and satisfying action sequences. Even the city of Gotham looked good. This film, however, features groan-inducing dialogue, a completely incoherent plot, offensively fluorescent sets, and just generally bad acting. I would rather have watched Batman Returns a second time."
2,"Bad, but not horrific","Look, a Batman movie is only as good as its Batman, and considering there have been a number of them throughout the entire series, I've gotta say that Val Kilmer is not only a terrible Bruce Wayne, but also a horrific Batman. Perhaps the worst, probably moreso than George Clooney. This movie was successful due to lots of advertising, flashy effects and the fact that it was a Batman movie. It's not so much that Val Kilmer can't make a good hero, but his acting performance in this is simply pathetic, he's like a piece of wood it's ridiculous and painful to watch a fantastic actress like Nicole Kidman putting her heart into her role meanwhile Kilmer is just responding like a stiff.Jim Carrey and Kidman make this one work. I have no idea what they were thinking casting Val Kilmer, it's no surprise to me that shortly after this film his career pretty much went downhill, they should've fired him early on and gotten someone else. No Batman will ever match Michael Keaton."
3,Not a bad movie,"But it certainly could have been a lot better. This film is nowhere near as good as its brilliant predecessors. Val Kilmar makes a mediocre Batman, and Chris O'Donnels Robin isn't much better. All the power, depth, subtlety, and psychological drama of the previous films are absent here; in their stead lies little more than an overly-done, loud, and heavily-stylized action flick. Still, it does reasonably well in the art department, and the acting is over-the top, but in a fun way. The action is smooth and well-made(though occasionally hard to follow). Basically, though not bad, it still pales in comparison to the darker, more adult ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", which were far better than this."
4,Val Kilmer blows Keaton and Doc Ross away,"Val Kilmer understood this part. Unfortunately, he couldn't develop it the way he really wanted to due to the ego of the director. Their feud is well chronicled and disturbing. I will agree that the first two were more dark and forboding, especially RETURNS with its intense sexual energy (not for the kiddies), but FOREVER did an excellent job of providing more action to an action starved series while staying true to the Batman mythos. The last scene in Arkham Asylum is really well done and leaves the door open for the future. Come back Val, we miss you!"
2,Falls short,"This film is somewhat lighter than the first two films, and in some ways it works. We begin to see the campiness of the next sequel, the god-awful ""Batman & Robin"". Jim Carrey does a decent job portraying the Riddler, but what is up with Two-Face? Out of all the Bat-villians portrayed in films, Tommy Lee Jones does the worst job. He makes his character totally uninteresting. If you want to see Two-Face done right, watch the animated series."
2,An insult to Bat - Fans!,"The ridler only tells one riddle. Two-face has only one personality. This movie is just a reminder of how superior the FOX cartoon series of ""Batman"" is to this empty-headed junk. On a daily basis, the cartoon series has ten-times better writing than this overbudgeted drivel."
3,"Good, not Great!","Batman Forever is a good film. Not a great. Unlike Batman and Robin, you can sit through it and not get bored! Val kilmer plays Bruce Wayne pretty good. But his Wayne is pretty restrained. Kilmer's Batman is close, but no cigar. Chris O'donnell is pretty good a Robin, htough his Dick Grayson is pathetic at times. The villans are pretty weak, not evil like Nicolson's Joker. Jones hames up his role a bit too much fr me to take, but he isen't the center of the film. If he was, I'd probably give this movie two stars. Carrey is just MARVELOUS as the Riddler! He dosen't have to be very evil(has the Riddler ever been very evil?), so it's easy for Carrey to portray the Riddler. Carrey's only fault is that he hams his part up a bit. Good directing by newcomer Shulmaker(far better than Batman and Robin!). This guy had good iedas. Overall, a good movie, and perhaps the only Batman movie that the family can watch together(well, maybe Batman and Robin, too) Overall,a good movie!"
2,"Batman ""Whatever""","Batman Forever is cartoonish, silly and filled with shallow performances. Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton as Batman. He turns in a souless performance, a complete walk through. Chris O'Donnell is the only spark of interest in the film as Robin. The rest of the characters include Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler.Under the direction of Joel Schumacher, the Batman entry looks like it's based on the campy Adam West series rather than the brooding Dark Night of the comics. The emphasis here is on flashy sets and comic one liners. This is the first dent in the Batman series and it only gets worse from here."
3,Actually I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.,"Batman Forever certainly doesn't measure up to the first two, but Batman fans would agree that this one still is quite good. Val Kilmer is no Michael Keaton but he is still good Batman. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey are wonderful additions as Two-face and The Riddler. The new stylized look mixed in with the old dark look makes Gotham look cool. The only flaw probably is Micaheal Keaton's absence as Batman. But as I said Val kimer is good. Also Robin's entrance is put in well."
1,NOOOOOO!,"Okay, admittedly all I've seen is the trailer and all I've heard are comments by other people, but even that it is enough to say with some confidence that if you have any regard for the character of Batman/Bruce Wayne DO NOT waste your time on this movie. Even the catchy quotes that appeared in the trailer were all wrong, and out of character for the Dark Knight. That smile of his? Yeah, not unless he was faking it for a reason, or had just been gassed by the Joker. Heaven forbid! If you want a good Batman movie, rent/buy Batman Begins."
3,Took a month but great product,"It took a complete month to get my book but I finally got it, in better condition than I expected. Thanks"
2,Don't be fooled by the name!,"This is not immersion. It is a series of games in Hebrew. The games will teach you vocabulary, but it will not teach grammar nor will it help you make sentences.On the positive side, I did find the games were useful in getting down vocabulary that I had a hard time memorizing. The other good thing about the CD is that there is no English."
2,Instant Immersion Hebrew,I was very disappointed in this title. There are better free programs online than this one. In my opinion don't waste your money. If you want a serious Hebrew program you should be searching titles available from Judaism websites. They may cost more but you are getting what you pay for.
4,gives history and current beliefs,"Gives history of each denomination, including groups within a denomination, in an interesting and readable format. Gives summary of basic beliefs. Avoids biased comparisons. Useful index. Would benefit from providing more details on the beliefs of each denomination."
3,"Broad, but shallow","This book came highly recommended to me. You see, I wanted to understand why there are so many Christian denominations out there, who they are, and what sets them apart. This book goes some way in that direction. It lists what must be all the denominations and gives a little information on them. There isn't any depth here, which means that you can read it, and never really get what the groups believe. For example, I have talked to people, and found out that Christians often use the same words, but when you get down into it, they mean something completely different when they use those words.Oh well, perhaps I was asking too much. If you want a book that is broad enough to list every denomination, but don't want any depth, then get this book. 3 stars."
1,Handbook of Denominations in the United States 13th Edition: 13th Edition,Do not buy this book in the Kindle edition. You can not use the go to function to get to the table of contents. This fact alone renders this book useless as a reference book unless you want to spend hours just clicking through pages to get to the place you want. You can't return a kindle book so my money was wasted and I won't spend more money to get the actual book.
3,Information seems Compressed,"I wish I could have given this handbook a higher rating. Reading about a particular sect, one feels that someone other than the authors had a heavy hand in the editing the entry. A little is told about a sect, but not enough to get a good feel about the sect's reasons for being separate from all other denominations.An interesting exercise is to compare entries from the 10th edition with the same entry in the 9th edition. One cannot help but wonder if the 9th edition mobilized what one can only imagined as powerful, sword-wielding, dour, fierce preachers standing over the authors as they produced the 10th edition."
3,Good Reference Book,"This is a good updated reference book with many of the religions listed. However, it does not have much substance or depth. I gave it a 3 star though because of the quality of including most of the religions! Provide some more depth...please!"
4,Definitely glad I bought this.,"This is just about the best book of its kind that I have found. I have bought several books in the past and not been very happy with them. The history of each denomination is covered thoroughly. In general, the beliefs of each denomination is covered, but I wish they had included another 1 or 2 paragraphs on the beliefs and practices of each denomination. The only book that MIGHT be better than this is the Encyclopedia of American Religions.I was also wondering why Hinduism was not covered in this book."
5,Wonderful reference,"This book was originally recommended to me by the instructor in a wine-tasting class that I took. It's a great reference. The introduction contains everything you'd want to know about how wine made - from the types of grapes to soil information to the anatomy of a winery and everything in between. The meat of the book gives incredible information about the various wine-making regions of the world (including newer, smaller areas). In each area (or sub-area, for the larger places), Johnson gives a map of the region, gives a detailed description, and identifies some of the major labels. Great book - I definitely want to keep this on my shelf!"
4,Must-have for wine lovers.,"The main interest in this book are regions, maps and tipe of wines. Every single wine region is explained and commented. But you also get to see an introduction to wines. The proccess, tipe of grapes, and so on. It is a must-have if you want to learn all about the great world of wine. And you get to understand why Hugh Johnson is a master in this field."
5,WINE BIBLE,"THIS BOOK IS SO INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL FOR NOT ONLY THE NOVICE, BUT THE PERSON WHO WOULD LIKE TO BRUSH UP ON THERE KNOWLEDGE OF WINES. HIGHLY RECOMEDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent book,"Whether you want to become an expert, or your are just interested in wines this is a great book. Very well written, easy to read and remains useful as reference material"
5,almost an encyclopedia,"This is my third copy of World Atlas. Each one has been such a substantial improvement over the previous one that its purchase was inevitable. Great maps, witty, relevant text and the usual breath-taking photographs of wine country. (did you ever notice that no body grows wine in ugly places?)"
3,the world atlas of wine,"Good, but not as in depth as Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia. Many typos. The section on Cote Chalonnais is cut off and the begining is repeated. Nice photos."
3,I thought it was okay,"I was a bit overwhelmed with the geography aspect of the book, but then again, it is a wine atlas. I would have liked a better listings of what wines to look for instead of the few that were given. If you are a beginner and would like a very good book that holds your attention, refer to the Windows on the World Complete Wine Course for 2003."
1,Poor Sonoma County Coverage,"While the book is very big, I felt Sonoma County California's wineries deserved more than about one page of coverage. This book seems to have a strong European bias.If you want much better coverage of California wines, try Matt Kramer's ""New California Wine"" also available at Amazon."
2,So-so,"Not Kenny's best. Charles Davis is ocassionally interesting. the sound on this reissue is rather indifferent. Fresh Sounds are not archivists. They are pirates. Sometimes the product is quite good. Often times, it is the only source for some performances, but it is not like you are buying it from Mosaic or some other archivist label."
5,DE kicks. Plain and simple.,"If there's a WIN/WIN situation, here it is. Great album.And the service was excellenté as always!"
1,A Discouraging Book,"I was severly disappointed in 'An Introduction to Christian Writing: An Indepth Companion to the Complete Writing Experience' by Ethel Herr. Oddly enough for someone who is supposed to have a Christian viewpoint, Ms. Herr seems to totally discount inspiration of any kind for a writer. Perhaps that's why I found her writing to be uninspired and uninspiring. She insisted writers use a cycle of endless writing and rewriting. It left me wondering when you get to the part about actually getting published. She had one valid point, in that authors may not make substantial amounts of money from writing (although that is the reason for being published) and should take solace in having done what God asked. Perhaps she hasn't heard about Internet marketing and promotion, although it's possible she wouldn't be inspired by it if she had.A caveat for those who take a writing course using this as a textbook--you will not find encouraging words here."
4,ok soulfly album,I think this soulfly recored is an ok recored in not as great but it is much better than soufly 3. there is more rocking sound and its much more better songs. but of couse nothing can bet the crate cameos on the primitive disc.
4,GREAT SOULFLY ALBUM!!!!,"After 2 not so good albuns, MAX create another great metal album!!! This one and the debut are the best albuns by SOULFLY!!!!"
3,"A nice album -> 3,5 stars",This album is not good not bad but its a little more better than just ok. They have the same formula on soulfly songs. A lot of changes and different parts (other are metal other are tribe and there are even female vocals in some tracks). The formula is good but the result is not so good as it was in their second album Primitive. I like what they <<try>> to do . I hope they succeed in the near future.
2,What's happened to you Max?,"For one thing, it seems that Max Cavalera is trying to change his musical soundscape yet again, as his Soulfly outfit returns with another major lineup change and an attempt to go at an even more harder edge. In the end however, ""Prophecy"" is a mess, and Max is doing more of the same that was featured on the last album, and it's sadly pretty lame. Not to mention, when did this guy get so religious? Like a previous reviewer stated, anyone else remember ""Antichrist"" and ""Necromancer""? How did this guy conjure up utter filler dribble like ""Moses"", ""I Believe"", and ""Wings""? I never thought I'd say it, but Sepultura is better off without Max leading the way, especially considering the direction he's taking Soulfly in. The title track is a solid song on it's own, but it's not enough to save ""Prophecy"" from being a coaster. All in all, it's about time for Soulfly to fly away."
2,Would have been great without the cheesy lyrics,"The album has some cool riffs, some cool parts, but the cheesy lyrics spoil it all... some parts & music are so cheesy that I cant help switching over to the next track which will start out great and end up having the same cliched lyrics with some over melodramatic acoustic guitaring.Examples:Some vocalist other than Max singing in an emo way- ""Every man has to find his own destiny, Just follow your heart and just let it be. I believe in God immortality""- ""Learn as if we are going to live forever, live as if we are going to die tomorrow""Give me a break!"
2,Are you people insane?,"This is their best album to date? Wataf are you guys talking about? I could make an album and put a bunch of Mariachi music and some whiney Spanish guy singing and you'd probably be, WOW, THIS ALBUM IS SO DIVERSE AND NEW, I LIKE IT...Pfft, get real, Max did waaaaaaay too much experimenting with this album and it didn't go right. The songs aren't heavy or have the same crushing beat like those on Primitive or III. Why does Max kick everyone out of his band every record? This is ridiculous, the songs have lost intensity, all of them. The only track I like off this album would be ""In the Meantime"" because it reminds me off the old hard Soulfly/Sepultura riffs.Do not buy this album if you're a hardcore Soulfly/Sepultura fan."
1,VERY ... DISAPOINTING ... ATTEMPT,"I am a massive soulfly fan but this album is by far their worst album out of the 4. The first album ""Soulfly"" was amazing and brought a new sound to metal with brazilian roots. (First heard in Maxs other band sepultura). The second album ""Primitive"" was also brilliant , it had so many great cameo guest vocal spots and sounded fantastic and the songs seemed to flow into each other. The third album ""3"" was another fantastic attempt it lacked the power of the last two albums but was still by far better than this new album i honestly cant believe Soulfly even released this. Plus Max has got rid of all the band members off the last album and gone back to original members and newbies. Why doesnt he just call the band ""Max Cavelera and others"" because the fact he still calls it soulfly is stupid. If you like metal which puts u to sleep then by all means buy this album. But if you are a hardcore soulfly fan dont buy it because you will only be as disapointed as i was.CH"
4,Their best album,"Being a huge fan of Sepultura during the Max days, I've always liked, but not really loved Soulfly. To me, Prophecy is the album Sepultura might have eventually made if Max had stuck around. The thing that really grabs me on this CD is that it simultaneously grabs your interest from the get-go and also displays a greater amount of musical virtuosity than the previous Soulfly releases. A word of warning, while the thrashy songs are amongst the best Soulfly has done, this album also contains a good deal of experimenting in other genres. For those who don't like touches of reggae, for example, in their thrash (only at times!) then this might not be for you."
4,"not the best, but...","This album goes back to the later sepultura/earlier soulfly style as opposed to the straight up hardcore/thrash that soulfly did with ""3"" and ""primitive"". Not as many guest appearances as max has used in the past, but that's simply a matter of preference. I was kind of disappointed in that fact, but others may be happy about that. The tone of the album has changed too, focusing largely on religion rather than using the war/revenge theme that seemed so prevalent on their previous 3 albums. This definitely affects the musical style and the album seems more subdued throughout. However, songs like ""born again anarchist"" and ""living sacrifice"" show that the hardcore element has certainly not died from Max's style, just faded to a less dominant position. I wouldn't recommend this if you're not familiar with soulfly or sepultura, but if you're a fan, you can appreciate this album."
5,SOULFLY KEEPS THE BRAZILIAN METAL SCENE ALIVE!,"(...) very inventive and provoking percussion helps this cd flow right along mixing heavy jams ala the 'ol ""Sepul'"" days with instrumental world ideas and native influences. Fans of the old school sound and maybe even some nu-metal kids (after being converted) might just get the tunes they've been waiting for all this time. This lineup seems to be the best one yet. Just bought this cd at 4pm and am already jammin' it twice! Do yourself a favour and grab this edition while you can. When you buy the disc it gives you a ""key"" to exclusive live tracks on the internet! Doesn't get much better than that. (...)"
4,"Not what I expected, good and bad.","Max is back with a new band and a new cd. Great. More stale nu-metal? Nope, this time they return with sepultura esque riffs and more so tribal and reggae influenced music. Much more non-metal sections, but the ones that are metal sound MUCH better.It also sounds like the lyrical content has gotten better too, but heres where I hit a rut. I seems to me that Max has a bad habbit of reusing many riffs and lyrics. I guess it'd be okay on a single, but in my opinion he's done it too many times. The lyrics that aren't reused seem to all reflect hollow ended views of religion... which I can't really get into. Other than that, they're getting better, I hope the next cd I can put 5 stars on."
2,boring,"I must say, I like Max Cavalera as a hardcore, metal musician, not as a religious one trying to be spiritual. I mean, come on Max! Don't buy this one, the real Sepultura fans wont like this Prophecy cd, but to give it a bit credit, the first song is good, the second one ok, and the rest, could care less.Again i still like Max, but maybe the next Soulfly or better yet Sepultura reunion is next, the fans are waiting, no more religious crap please."
5,Nice,Wanted to see a part of Julianne Moore and I see she nailed it in this movie. Really lovely to watch.
4,I liked it,"The dvd arrived on time and it was in the condition that the seller advertised. I rated it a four because I liked it, and with the service, I didn't have any problems getting the merchandise that I ordered, which was great. ml"
4,Charming Chemistry-Good Moral,"I liked this film a great deal. I thought it was far better than ""Intolerable Cruelty"", which I thought was caustic and heartless in its characterization of divorce. This film is about divorce lawyers, but it is PRO-marriage!It was charming and funny, but it also made you feel good after seeing it. It has become my favorite film that deals with this topic. It's message is simple, if people put as much effort into their marriages as they do into tearing them apart, the divorce rate would be a lot less.The Irish country-side is beautiful and the courtroom bits are quite funny. Forget the professional reviews, they must have had an axe to grind with someone connected to this film. The film is very good. Enjoy."
4,Good,It was a very nice movie and the pairing of Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan was realyl different to see but they worked well together.
4,Not bad.,"I guess I'm a sucker for formula romances because I actually enjoyed this film. Not a fan of either Brosnan or Moore, I consider myself completely unbiased in regards to this movie. Although, I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, I do get trapped by such classics(haha) as Sleepless in Seattle and Pretty Woman. Believe me, this movie is no Pretty Woman. What is it then? Well, it's witty. Small details will have you giggling to yourself. Julianne Moore's performance is adorable, which is a stretch for her. Of course, Pierce Brosnan pulls off the role of the aging bachelor well. Together, while sparks don't fly, there is a definite chemistry and an obvious mutual respect for one another. Don't look to this film for a blockbuster. Do look to this film for a fun curl-up-on-the-couch-together-on-a-rainy-day flick."
3,"Good Message, But Soooo Unrealistic","I like the theme of the movie, which is that marriage is a thing worth fighting for. This is rather refreshing where marriages only work half the time, divorce court is filled to overfilling, and people are making predictions of how many weeks a Hollywood marriage will last.But the rest of it is just silly and unrealistic. Where do they find these writers?That aside, Brosnan and Moore do a good job despite the poor script they are given. There are a few scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny.Worth checking out? I think so, only because of the central theme which is something that should be shouted from roof-tops. But don't expect anything smart or realistic."
4,A Nice Little Movie,"A rented this movie because I couldn't find anything else to rent and I came away really liking it. Laws of Attraction is a throw-back to the kind of romantic comedies you don't see much these days and the chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore is great; in addition, Michael Sheen and Parker Posey as a rock star and his wife engaging in a nasty divorce is laugh-out-loud sometimes. Yeah, it's kind of schmaltzy, but it's nice to watch that kind of movie now and again."
3,A bit of a disappointment.,"I was excited to see this movie when it came out, and I just got around to watching the DVD. Although the premise of the film was good (Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore are opposing divorce attorneys in New York City who have a love/hate relationship and accidentally tie the knot after an evening of drunkenness), the movie was disappointing overall. I'm a fan of both Brosnan and Moore, but I didn't think they had much on-screen chemistry at all. Moore's character was really annoying throughout the film, and Brosnan's quirky lawyer character had some funny moments, but it wasn't enough to save the film. Also, the plot had some holes in it and the dialogue was painful to listen to at times. A lot of the big jokes in the film weren't very funny at all. If you're a fan of either of the two leads, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of the film, but otherwise it's worth skipping."
2,I tried to like it..,Really like Juilanne Moore but the story was so predictable. Some cute moments and occasional humor but I would not watch again....
5,Fun movie!,"Don't take this one seriously. It is for fun and it is fun and funny and silly funny. Two attractive lawyers, one male and one female, represent a high-profile couple (He is a punk rock star and she is a famous designer). The She-attorney is stuck with the husband and the He-attorney is stuck with the wife. The sparks fly all around and make for madcap entertainment when the divorcing couple disappear at the same time and the lawyers have to track them down to a castle overseas. This is an enjoyable movie if one isn't anal about it."
2,Light and Predictable,"If you are simply looking for some escapist fluff--or just want to look at Pierce Brosnan for awhile--""Laws of Attaction"" may work for you. Brosnan was his usual dashing self in this film, but there was not enough substance to make the film memorable, or to provide any basis for concluding that the role played by Julianne Moore was that of a hotshot atorney. In fact, she was so poorly prepared for her court hearings, it is a wonder she still had a job! Verisimilitude was shorter than the word itself. Except for the pleasure of watching Brosnan onscreen, I didn't care a whit about any of the characters."
2,Brosnan and Moore give a little life to this shabby script,"I love Pierce and Julianne, but this script is a stinker!! It's not convincing, overly predictable, poorly directed and made it to rental status (DVD/VHS) in record time after the release. The time just drudged on and on. I kept looking at the DVD player to see if it was about over, sad to say. The production value was very low, too. Of course two opposing lawyers are going to fight, but to try and weave an infatuated relationship between the two? I could see it, but the director obvisouly didn't.There were a couple of clever scenes and a couple of ""emotional shakers"", but other than that, this is, sadly, a bust."
3,Nice Movie But Not Great,While I like Laws of Attraction. I would have to agree with the others this isn't a blockbuster. Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan make a great team despite the fact the movie was alright . Intolerable Cruelty was much better. all in all It wasn't bad
3,Fun and silly,"Okay, on the whole I liked this film, because in the end it had a good message--that marriage is worth fighting for and that relationships aren't easy, but they are worth the effort.There is a pretty high cheese factor in this film...thanks to Julianne (e.g., the scene of escaping His office without getting caught was nuts, but fun, and then the secret cam shots--perfect). I didn't scream too much, but I did laugh a lot.What I didn't like--getting into a situation because you got so drunk one night that you didn't know what you were doing; I think this premise is over used and abused. So, I guess in the end it depends on what you value more: a good ending (get the film) or more responsible characters (couldn't get past the first act)."
5,Good movie.,"A very good romance movie.I think anyone who likes romances,will definitely like this movie.It has some comedy and the actors do a great job. Amazon has all the best romantic movies. Thank you,Julie"
3,It was a good rental but I wouldn't buy it.,"Well, it was ok. There were moments that you found the pairing really hard to imagine. It was ok, but you never reall felt it. the movie is only 1 hour 27 mins. so it skips of lot. Moore and her inability to be funny. She is not a comic actress."
3,An Innocent Little Diversion,"""Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes...."" You know the jingle. LAWS OF ATTRACTION is a pleasant enough diversion, sort of background Muzak-type of Hollywood film. The interaction of two polar opposite Divorce Attorneys isn't a deep cup of tea, but as acted by Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan it becomes a light truffle for a nice evening's viewing. Don't expect much and you'll be very happily surprised. Nice to see Moore and Brosnan just having fun - and they really are as fine as comic actors as they are in their usual heavier roles. Plenty of time for raiding the fridge for snacks without putting it on pause. Nothing wrong with that!"
3,Light fun,"Pure fluff. This is the kind of movie you watch, simply to be entertained. (that's how movies should be sometimes isn't it?). It's short, sweet, even amusing at times. I think in keeping this short however, the creators left out a few plot points that would've made this a little more believable. Regardless of what's missing, it has a classic happy ending that may or may not leave you wondering (are they for real?). I'd watch this again. I guess that says something."
4,A grown up Remington Steele,"This picture tries to harken back to the screwball comedy format of the 30's and 40's. It was funny, romantic, and visually beautiful. A very nice date movie for grownups. Brosnan plays a slightly sloppy version of the Remington Steele of his youth. Moore trys to play a woman whose job has spoiled her faith in men and marriage. She is too sweet in her role. However, they do click onscreen and he is so very,very handsome. In the mold of so many recent romantic comedies like Intolerable Cruelty,and Somethings Gotta Give, the writing and jokes start off fast and funny but bog down in the plot twists and slightly slow pacing. I hope hollywood's writers can someday come to terms with the idea that the movie can keep up speed and pacing even with the love scenes heating up and the sparks changing from anger to affection. It should as funny and fast for the middle and end as it was at the beginning."
5,Cute and funny.,I love this movie. I had looked everywhere to find it cheap and this was the best site. I would reccommend this to anyone who loves watching to people argue and then fall in love.
1,yawn yawn,"BIG YAWN. Bad acting,this is onr of the most boring movie I've EVER seen. Not funny, not romantic, not clever, not anything. Waste of money. Don't want it in my movie collection and Not worth giving it to somebody. Really want to ditch this in the garbage bin. Maybe it can be sold at Ebay's... for the fans of these two..."
3,BREAKING THE LAWS,"LAWS OF ATTRACTION is like eating cotton candy; it's light and airy and refreshing while you're eating it, but it doesn't stay with you long. A romantic comedy that heralds back to movies of the thirties, this fluffy concoction is entertaining at times, but it's so obviously contrived, it's hard to take it seriously. Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore play opposing divorce lawyers who fight, bicker and obviously fall madly in love, although Moore finds it hard to make the commitment. After they get hopelessly drunk at an Irish party, they awaken to find themselves married and thus the story evolves. Moore and Brosnan are charming in their roles, with Moore taking the bigger stretch as a comedienne. Brosnan has played this smoothie many times before. Frances Fisher is fun as Moore's vain mother; Michael Sheen and Parker Posey are delightful as the bickering couple who are fighting over his Irish castle. It's all lightweight and breezy but not the best of its kind."
4,Not up for an academy award - so back off,"Okay, so 'Laws of Attraction' is not going to bring home any Academy Awards, so back off a little. The critics were really hard on this movie, but I thought it was a completely enjoyable 87 minutes. If your want a similarly themed movie with move snap and wit, go check out 'Intolerable Cruely'...the Massey Pre-Nup? Now, that's great comedy.But give me Julianne Moore over Catherine Zeta Jones any day of the week. Moore is perfectly cast here as Ms. All Prepared Smarty Pants getting dusted by a seemingly ill-prepared but cagey Pierce Brosnan. And let's give it up for Bronsan. Despite the handicap of of being almost ridiculously charming and handsome (they try to tousle him up here a bit, but it has no effect), he proves very adept at his first attempt at self-deprecating, screwball comedyAlso, Nora Dunn is a hoot. For those thinking she;s playing Nora Dunn, remember 'Three Kings'. This lady is pretty fair actress in he own right."
4,Lighten up!,"With the angst, gore, and hell-ishness so abundant in the current roster of films at my local theatres, it was delightful to find something light, frothy, and just plain fun. Thanks to Laws of Attraction for delivering a evening of gentle humor and charm. If you want something ""socially signficant"", this is not your flick. But, if you are looking for a film about grown-ups flinging, floundering and finding themselves in love, this is $8 well spent.It doesn't hurt that the leads are so easy on the eyes and so completely believable with each other. A stylish effort."
3,Cute but nothing new,"I love Ms. Moore's acting, but she is not a comedienne. Mr. Bronson does a better job with comedy. All in all this was a cute, formulaic boy meets girl film. The sexual tension was mild, and the theme tried and true.Save money. If you go to see this go to a matinee."
1,Malarky!!!!,This was a completely unrealistic feministic role reversal fantasy. With no disrespect or disregard for maturity in women; Julianne Moore can do every minute of the well preserved 56 year old role that was portrayed to be her Mother's age.
2,About as atttracting as two positive ends of a magnet,This film containts all the elements for a delightful comedy but at the end one is left with a feeling that a lot of things were just not right. Talk about formulaic - you knew from the first that the two divorce lawyers would eventually marry. And that they would also battle in court. And that they would have problems.What you DIDN'T know was that the attraction between the two would be about as phony as a North Korean promise and the sexual tension (quote unquote) had about as much spark as a used firecracker. Cutesy rather than cute.
1,A Solid Waste of Your Time,"First things first. It was an atrocious idea to cast these co-stars in their roles. Not only does Pierce Brosnan's performance feel forced, but Julianne Moore is remarkably bland and unappealing. That's not even the worst aspect of this appropriately labeled piece of garbage. The arguements these two get into are notably tedious and uninteresting. The shallowness of all the characters is mind-blowing, and those two celebrity clients are incredibly stupid, not only in their acting but in the stereotypical fashion in which they were created. I could've done a whole lot more with myself in the time I wasted on this."
2,A romance that lacks chemistry and you can safely skip,"Being a Brosnan fan, I just had to watch this movie, but afterwards I was so glad I got it as a free rental at Blockbuster rather than paying for it (or wasting $10 in theater when it first came out). This romance flick just lacks chemistry, and lacks a good storyline. Even though the ""anti-Irish"" talk was way overhyped, the movie came out pretty much anti-romance and anti-audience. The love development between the two protagonists is just so predictable and bland, and the movie is just totally boring."
2,Meh,"Pierce Brosnan really needs to do away with his tradmark smirk: it's really getting tedious. He's the weak element in a fluffy flick which features lots of nice light comic performances. Julianne Moore displays good comic timing as the opposing counsel and Michael Sheen whoops it up as her not-that-bright client.It's not a movie you remember much after it's over, but it's actively offensive, and that's---well, that's about it."
1,Available copies not worth the Price,"While I value Helen Van Wyk's teaching style this is not her best contribution. That being said, it was certainly worth the retail price when it was in print. The recent price escalation since it went out of print bumps it down at least two stars and perhaps four. My advice is to write Helen Van Wyk,s estate/publishing company ( most likely her husband ) and encourage a reprint. In the meantime go to the library, read it, return it, and let the price mongers keep their books."
5,Nice Addition to our Kitchen!,"Purchased this beautiful stainless kitchen cart based upon all the good reviews it received from others and they are quite right. My husband put this together in about an hour (with a timeout for a couple slices of pizza, lol) and he commented about how well-made this cart is. We had several extra pieces of hardware leftover, which is rare to find in most kits today too. It's the perfect height for doing all my prep work (the basic reason I purchased it) and I can also free up some well-needed counter space with the shelves provided.Well worth the money and the free shipping was a big bonus too. Well-made and so pretty! Would definitely purchase from this vendor again."
1,Wrong Item,"Beware, I'm sure I would have liked this item, but instead got the wooden top. Just love having to send back a 70+ pound box."
5,Quality w/ Ease of Assembly,"I just put this together over the weekend and I must say I could not be happier. I have assembled more than my share of ""boxed"" furniture and so often there are problems, but this cart is quality. The holes were drilled properly, the pieces were marked and they even supply an extra piece of hardware for every format used. Very considerate. The instructions make sense with one small caveat. Do not look at the hole marks on the illustrations as a guide for placement, as I did find one mistake on the back panel. Just know that all multiple holes will go inward. External holes also get plugged with nice finishing dowels. Upshot is, the piece is extremely strong, the wood is good quality, the drawers run smoothly and the stainless steel top is beautiful and is extremely heavy. This is not a flimsy piece. There's also butcher block top version, Solid Wood Top Kitchen Cart And Workcenter , which I just ordered a few minutes ago, being that I liked this unit so much."
4,It's perfect.,Perfect size. Functional and stylish. Easy to put together. A great product at a great price. Putting it together was quick and easy. Make sure you have an electric screwdriver.
3,Great product except...,This is a beautiful cart. The assembly could have been easy...but the holes in the top were not square. Therefore I had to drill different holes to square it up. Someone who does not have access to tools to do this may want to buy a different product.
4,good,"Good service through amazon once again. i bought this 5in 12in to add to my collection for someting different from this band.... once again, one of the most underated group in america....maybe its because the way they look....hmmmmm? but great band very talented group!!!!!!!!"
5,AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE...,"This is one of the best recording of the 8th symphony of BRUCKNER, the one i had was by ""Sir Georg Solti"" and it was a very good performance and i had think that the recording of Solti was the best of ever.Until i heard the recording Of ""Herbert Von Karajan"" with the ""Wiener Philarmoniker"" and it was the most amazing performance,and later i heard the Extra-Performance Of ""Carlo Maria Giulini"" and i think it's the ideal Recording because Giulini make the Orchetra so Dynamic and So loud With an extra vision of the Symphony. The device that i should Give is to By this Master CD Of DG, don't Be late...! i'm Waiting for your Opinions Hurry!"
2,All the same.....,"I can only blame myself for not being more attentive to the song list - there are many cd's in this package, but they're all the same! Read the song list carefully before you purchase."
2,Wimpy collar,"I am sooo frustrated with Halloween costumes that don't look like or perform like their pictures. I would like to know how they made the collar stand up for the picture! I ended up painting wire black and then hot glueing it to the back of the collar and dress to get it to slightly stand up like the picture. Otherwise it just looks like a sailor collar because it velcros onto the inside of the dress. The costume is true to size and of decent quality material, just poor poor collar!!"
2,"Good, but turned bad","I had an allergic reaction so I have nothing good to say. Maybe this will not happen to everyone I am assuming, but it happened to me, so look out!!!!!!!! Caused the areas around my eyes to become very very dryed out... red, chapped, etc. It was NOT good. Hopefully no one else has this reaction. When I put them on they felt refreshing, so I kept using them... but I will not use them again due to my reaction. If you have sensitive skin do not use. Sorry :("
2,Wish I had stopped after first three,"This book was rather boring and slow. In fact, I only read half of it before returning it to the library. I didn't even care about the characters this time. Very disappointing."
1,too much,"I guess Maupin just ran out of steam. He should have done the decent thing after More Tales.. and let 28 Barbary Lane drift over the Reichenbach Falls. The series started with some great books, with interesting characters he clearly felt sympathy for. By book 3 (Further Tales...) he was introducing increasingly improbable characters (Jim Jones, alive and well and living in Golden Gate Park!), but enough weird plot interest to keep me going to the end of the book. Babycakes doesn't even do that. He's made a big mistake by moving the action from SanFrancisco to the UK - he loves S.F. and the way of life there is a great theme. He doesn't get England the same way, and even gets his facts wrong. There are two really good books in this series, but this isn't one."
5,Marvellous!,"""Babycakes"" is one of the most touching novels in the ""Tales of the City"" series as it marks the end of the seemingly fun-filled pre-AIDS era, and the beginning of death, despair and tragedy. It's deliciously comic whilst at the same time having essences of profound sadness on every page. Freud would have a field day analysing the symbolic significance of the endless rain that drones on throughout most of the book. More sombre and more political than his first three novels Babycakes is firmly planted in the period of the very early eighties. Maupin is a topical writer and seems to draw influence from his immediate surroundings and the time in which he lives. Although almost twenty years have passed since the early 80s the relevance and importance of his subject matter remains undiminished by time."
5,A GREAT INSPIRING MOVIE!,This is a great inspiring movie based on a true story. The cast is perfect and the movie reminds us that God is still in the miracle business! Throughly worth your time to watch this one! There are interviews with the cast members as a bonus feature!
2,"Sadly, not that great...","Borrowed this from the library. It is based on the true story of Craig Shergold, a boy with cancer who desires to break the Guinness Record of most ""Get Well"" cards received before he dies. Not only does he break the record, he lives!There is a bit of inspiration to be garnered and it was worth watching once, however, I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing it. The acting was lacking; English accents would disappear, the boy seemed to be delayed in addressing his lines and often just sat there trying to ""look sick"". Kirk Cameron's (tiny) role was obviously added just to get him in. I was also quite dismayed at the direction/lines given to the mother, who's faith often seemed to revolve around the cards, rather than God. While I can't imagine the immense stress this family must have been under ~ the mother was downright insufferable at points."
1,HATED IT! What an insult to God!,"At first I thought this was going to be a good movie; someone turning to God to get through a difficult time in their life. But instead the mother in the film began to put her faith in the cards, and in her own obsession of collecting them for her son. She neglects others in her family in doing so. She was snippy and rude. In the end, when all goes well, she gives the credit to the cards and her own determination. She gave none of the credit to God. Wasn't the whole reason for the film supposed to be to give credit where credit is due? Shame Shame on her! My copy went straight into the trash. . . where it belongs! Joshua 24:15; Philippians 4:8"
1,Awful. Plain awful,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting. The actors were completely unlikable and ill suited to their roles. The girl has about 4 facial expressions, none of them believable. The guy was just as bad. Don't waste your time on this stinker. It is beyond amateur and not worth 15 cents let alone 99."
2,Not that great,"The gate was easy to install and looks fine, if a little chitzy. BUT, the latch is near impossible to do one handed, and really hard to do with two. You certainly can't do it with the light off. Sort of a drag when you have to go through it in the middle of the night. THe top and bottom each only clicks into the eye part of hook and eye set. I don't think it's that sturdy. I wouldn't recommend this gate if you have to go through it often. Lots of them are much easier."
1,Terrible!,"Bought this gate for the top of our staircase... and returned it the very next day. The quality was poor - it seemed very flimsy, and I was concerned as to whether it would hold up if my 18 month old or 3 year old pushed or pulled on it. It was also extremely difficult to latch - you had to line up a hook/eye at the bottom and squeeze in and lock into place at the top all at once... not an easy task with a child in your hand. Yes, this gate has a bargain price - but I quickly figured out why! Might be sufficient for a doorway, but definitely would not recommend for staircases."
1,Wood Gate,Slats are too far apart.Would not reccommend for small pets or puppys.I had a puppy and it would not work.
1,"Flimsy, do not buy","I needed a strudy, hardware-mounted gate for the top of the stairs. This product fell apart. The materials are light and flimsy. For example, the hook that actually closes the gate does not hold up to normal wear and tear, doesn't close properly without a lot of effort, and is generally a piece of junk. It does mount easily and might hold out a small dog, but not children, and should not be used ever in a high-traffic area where you'll need to open and close it regularly."
2,motorola thin shell,"This product was ok at first...a bit bulky. After about 2 weeks it started falling apart at the seams. I have since taken it off, and my phone is holding up just fine. I wouldn't spend the money."
3,Moto v3 leather cover case,"Fits well & snugly on the Moto Razr V3 phone. Nice (magenta) pink like or strawberry color. You can fell the leather with good stitching around it, also the price was extremly affortable."
4,pink leather razr shell,"very cute,has a nice feel in the hand,ilove that it has a little ring on the back so you can can put a wristlett on it ,and it's not a bright pink so it's good for mature wimen also.try it ,you'd like it."
3,Leather Wrapped Thin Shell Magenta,"The color is not magenta, it is hot pink. The platic see-through face cover fell off. The part that clips into the belt clip (round, star like object) gets loose and allows the phone to roll freely on the clip."
5,A great tv,"The picture is great, and the menus are easy to navigate. If you hook this up to a ps3, or a blue-ray player you will be very happy. The only issue I have is with the remote control. The keypad is higher up then any remote I've used since the early 1980's. Other than that, this tv is worth every penny."
5,This is a simple review.,This is a great system. Every input and output that you would want. Especially good in high-lit rooms. The viewing angle is great. Just for those two things I would have upgraded from my analog CRT TV. But this is a great investment as more TV stations go to HD and more programs are shot in HDTV. Bottom-line impressive. But if you haven't had or seen an HDTV don't think you are going to be blown away by extremely high detail. This will only come when everything is full HD.
2,disappointment,"All I can say is IMAGE SMEAR.....I was really disappointed in the PQ of this panel. There is alot of noise even on HD-DVD, and with Noise Reduction turned on (even on low), I saw the worst image smearing I have ever seen. Images trailed across the screen with quick movement. Totally unacceptable for a panel that costs as much as the Sony. I think Sony is in trouble with the new Sharp LCD's as they are almost 1/3 with the same image quality."
5,Clouds,"***ATTENTION***The ""clouds"" are an issue that sony is aware of. It happens in the corners of the display because screws that fasten the display and/or frame are being torqued too much in the manufacturing process.Yeah it still sucks, but it's not a permanent thing. Then again, at this price tag, it's still unacceptable."
1,Not a good purchase!,"We purchased this television December of '06. Although the television is nearly 3 years old, the first 21 months it was used at most an hour a day. Around August of '08 the television began having issues sporadically. I would have to power the television on a few times before it would turn on (despite the fact that the power light was on). There was no sound and no picture, just a blank screen. Finally in September of '08 the television never fully turned on (still a power light on, but no picture, no sound. After contacting a repair man, I was told the main board is probably 'fried' and needs to be replaced at the cost of $4,000. I found mutliple instances of this when 'googling' the problem! Not having purchased a 2 year extended warranty, the television is now useless. I'd suggest googling no picture, no sound on the KDL40XBR2 before making this purchase"
5,Beautiful TV...does anyone have a color profile for it?,"The TV itself is gorgeous, but for some reason the colors look strange when I hook it up to my computer. Does anyone know where to get a color profile for the monitor?"
1,Sony Bravia Television break after one year,DO NOT BUY A SONY BRAVIA TELEVISION. They work for one year and then break. They then try to upsell you on a new television when you call to get a repair.
4,good,"It's good and cheap ,these are what I like , but it is small to me,I think the size are not allowed,these are what I don't like, Thanks!"
5,Unusual to find 33 waist,Dits great and looks good on! Came quickly and absolutely clean. Would recommend Lee over Levi for quality at the price point.
2,TOO BIG,"Item was marked at a size which normally fits me. These were very, very large.They were not what I expected at all. I was trying to get a standard or slim fit jean."
5,Doesn't get any better,"Great heavy denim, excellent fit and finish, love'm. If you're looking for a quality upgrade to classic Levi's, then these are the jeans you've been hoping for."
5,"Goodbye Levis, Hello Lee","Like thousands of other lifetime Levi fans, I got tired of low quality and high prices. I got real tired of pulling my pants up. When I read the Levis reviews here I knew it wasn't just me.So I said, it's time to try a pair of Lee jeans. Today I tried them on. They fit great. No missing belt loops. No flimsy fabric. Then I road tested them. I went out to the store and came home. I didn't need to pull them up even once. Hoo boy!I'm a believer now. I'm going to buy more. At close to half the price of Levis, I can afford it."
4,Lee's Jeans,"The quality on these jeans were great, they were not real heavy wieght denim but they were comfortable, the sizing was exactly what I usually buy and they fit good. the reason I ordered from Amazon was because I can never find these in a 29"" inseam at the stores, so i will be ordering all my jeans from Amazon going forward."
1,"1,st Time Dissapointed by Amazon online order.","1'st time dissapointed by a product ordered online from Amazon.These jeans I ordered had a right hand pocket that had not been properly sewn.3 inches of the upper seam of this pocket had to be sewn shut----after I discoveredI was losing a few things from this faulty pocket. Had to repair this seam.I have been buying these jeans locally and have an entirely better fitting jean, they aretruly 34W x 29L--Amazon's are more then 34W x 29L and also DARK BLUE JEANS INSTEAD OF PEPPERSTONE.The Salvation Army now has this disapointing Amazon order.C. B."
3,You get what you pay for,"These jeans aren't bad, per se, but the material is quite stiff and uncomfortable. On top of which, I'm not sure who defines the sizes on these, because 30W has always fit me, unlike these jeans."
4,"Standard jeans, very good for the price","Jeans are jeans. They're blue, have zips, have pockets, and have seams on the sides. For a poor jean connoisseur like me, these are some very excellent jeans: they're cheap, they fit, and they fit my definition of jeans.This pair's strongest suit is its price, being at half of what you'd pay for some other brand. They are however a little on the thin fabric side, so don't be expecting a great deal of thermal insulation from wearing them. If you're the athletic type with some very defined thighs you're going to find the standard size a little on the tight side.If I was to recommend another product over this one, it'd be the cheap $15 jeans you can find at a Target store; the two pairs I purchased two years ago still serve me faithfully now. If however you're in my condition (no nearby cheap store), then these aren't that bad a deal. Do buy one size larger though, as those will fit much more comfortably."
2,reyurned item,Ordered these is 36 x 29--however the length was at least 2 inches off. Have purchased these in the past and did not have this problem
2,i do not like it,back pockets are radically different. not the same as it showed on the picture. it's a great pity! i do not like the color
3,Jeans,Poor appearance dirty and rumpled. Fine for the yard but would not want to wear them out for a social event
3,Worth the Money but...,"I purchased these during a sale on Amazon, but if these are not on sale on Amazon, they could probably be found elsewhere fir less money. The quality is fine, but they are a bit stiff. Size is true so be sure and order the correct size."
5,got these for my dad,"i'm assuming my dad liked them. i got him the darker color to be a little more hip, and he liked them!"
3,Not true to size,"I got these in a 36 x 36 and, while the length is fine, the waist is too tight.Color really bleeds when washing.I guess you save a few bucks and you lose some quality."
5,Great!,"Received my order on time. The pants' material is great, and seems very strong; the size and color was correct also."
2,Style Change,It seems that there was a change in the style of the jeans. They have a lower rise than previous Lee jeans I have purchased and the pockets seem to be set lower. It looks like the pants are being worn low when they are not. It seems to be a younger style rather than something for a mature man.
4,A bit wide in the leg area.,"Cheap Jeans, about the right size, and other than the leggings being a bit too wide, these jeans are perfect.Not an alternative to dickies since the threading is thicker, hence the name jeans not pants.For the price it's alright."
1,Terrible,"My husband has been wearing lee jeans for decades. This is the same name and the same description but not the same jean. The waist is enormously wide for a 34 and the whole style is more like 'no style' and no defined waist. On top, the legs and seat are also much wider than the earlier models and we don't even want to mention the material...Ours are going back."
5,Excellent pair of jeans. Gets dirty easily though but very comfortable.,"Got these jeans for $25 on a sale, so can't complain about the pricing at all. Very comfortable jeans, have a great fit and look good. Fit around the waist, thigh and foot is perfect, no complaints. However, it tends to get dirty a little too easily and it feels as though it may fade after a certain number of washes.On the whole, very satisfied with this pair and would definitely buy more or recommend."
5,Just what I was looking for.,I had serched all the local retail stores as well as the mail order stores I dealt with on a regular basis and could not find Lee jeans in my size. It wasn't until a friend suggested Amazon that I was able to find the exact manufacture and size of jean I was searching for.I am completely satisified with the product as well as the price and intend to order several more pair in a few weeks.
3,High waist compared to Levi's 501,"The jeans are well made and the size fits, but I wasn't aware of the waist. The waist is higher than I'm used to, and I doesn't feel comfortable in these. If you're looking for an alternative to Levi's 501 look elsewhere. The waist rise is 12.5"" compared to Levi's 501 which have a rise of 11.25""."
4,Good quality,"Lee just makes a good set of jeans that can take a lot of use. Good fit, good construction. Nothing negative to say."
3,okay jeans,"These pants feel comfortable, but the pockets are very short. How short? My keys tend to sit right at the bend in my upper legs when I sit and my legs go numb. The pockets are about 3/4 the size of other jean pockets. This is a show stopper for me, because I always have to carry two sets of keys with me. Other than that, the pants are comfortable."
4,Honest price/performance product,The size range was the most important factor for picking them up. The price is also very good. By the end of the day a decent product.
1,Must be mismarked!,I've been wearing Lees regular fit straight leg jeans for many years now.I assumed that these 2 pair would be the same fit as all the other Lee regular fit straight led jeans that I already own.These are relaxed/loose fit.If these arn't relaxed fit I hate to see what realxed fit are like! I feel like I'am wearing potatoe sacks.I already washed then before wearing them so I guess I can not return them.Try them on first!
5,Great Jeans,"Lee jeans fit great,are very comfortable, and are very affordable. I have looked at other jeans, but I always choose to buy Lee jeans."
5,It fits and looks nice,I measured my waist and inseam by myself and the size works pretty well with the ordered jean. It's good.
4,"thick pants, too long for me","the size info is not very clear for me. so i pick the longest one, unfortunately too long. it is thick. will stick hairs."
2,Not button fly like it states,"The description states that these are button fly... They are NOT, they are zipper fly.100% cottonButton Fly closureEverything about this jean feels just rightAn everyday fit that's not too tight & not too looseIf you are looking for buton fly don't waste your time with these.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008EOH9Shttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008EOEV4http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XDQH4K"
1,claims to the quality,I am writing from Georgia. I've got my order from your site but I would like to tell you that an amount of details of the belt that I've ordered to you are not enough. Besides back pockets are absolutely different from item that was uploaded on your site; lines are not straight i.e. they have low quality. Moreover quality of the material is not corresponding to that brand (Lee).
2,Poorly executed stonewashing,"Yes, I know stonewashed is supposed to be faded. However, the stonewashed versions are very poorly done. The Classic Stone is overdone to the point of being unwearable outside of working in the yard. Dark Stone is a standard jean that's been washed twice. Awful execution."
5,Sale on Lee Jeans,"I bought these for my son for Christmas, they were first quality, arrived in time for christmas,and at a great price!"
3,I like my black LEE jeans,"I was sceptical about ordering clothing over the net, the sizing charts were accurate. How ever the jeans were a size out compared to my current jeans. Not sure if US 40inches must be different to Aussie 40inches. I call them ""comfortable"" and the first time I have not had to cut half the legs off to make them fit."
2,the internal finish of the pocket,"I did not like the internal finish of the front pocket of low quality, expected better. As to the shape of the rear pocket is not the original LEE. I am disappointed with this pant."
5,Lee Jeans,I bought these for my husband and he is hard to fit. These were perfect and look great. The price was also great. Thank You
2,Not what was expected!,"The pictures presented differ absolutely from what I have received: the jeans are too baggy! they correspond to the relaxed but not to the regular fit. Dark stone color appeared more like ""pepper prewashed"". I give two stars because it is made of good heavy denim, otherwise these jeans are only good for working e.g. in the garden."
3,Flawed,"These jeans are a lighter weight jean. The colors are fine and look like normal light weight Lee jeans(I purchased 5).Four of these and 1 from another item from amazon. BUT- the label in the waist have been sewn through the waist band. This is the first for us. We have 5 men in this famly 15-50 and not one of their Lee jeans have this. I will take a seam ripper and remove the threads. But, I will no longer purchase them from here."
3,It's too heavy,"It's too heavy, maybe for a cold weather that will be a good choice. To be honest, I think Levi's suits me better."
4,Great Lee Jeans!! But messed up on the sizes,I bough couple of Lee Denim Jeans. They are great on quality and price!! But they messed up on the sizes. I asked for 33x30. They sent me the same but actually the real size of the Jeans is smaller then what it claims.Otherwise Great piece
5,First time buying this brand for a man,I got these for my husband as a gift on the chance that he may like them. Well he LOVED them. He really liked the fit and feel of the jean as well as remarking on the quality. I've often bought LEE for myself and have always had good results with them so I thought I'd give them a go for my husband. Would definitely recommend them to someone who isn't about BRAND names or TRENDY styles such as the current 'skinny' jeans or the baggy 'street' style that is so often found in stores.
5,Great Classic Jeans,Nice jeans with a classic fit. Not too baggy or trendy and available in shorter lengths. Good price and good service.
3,Not too bad but not the same ones that i purchase locally,"I usually get my Lee from Local Sears and really like how they fit, It has been a while and i havent see them in stock at sears so i decided to purchase to Amazon, Even when is exactly the same PN in the tag those are different, they ones i found in Sears are made in Costa Rica, while the ones from Amazon are From Mexico, the Ones from Costa Rica Fit nicely on the waist and the fabric is thicker but soft, these ones from Mexico are too loose at the waist and even when Fabric is softer but thinner and the design make my rear end look flat. Still is not so ugly to not use them but i was expecting to get the same quality as the ones purchased locally."
4,Muy buenos jeans,"Muy buen jean. Hacia mucho tiempo que tenía un Lee. El color esta muy bueno. La talla, el corte y la confección son muy buenas tambien. Este es el segundo par que me compro. Puede alternar con los Levis, y ser una alternativa muy buena y un poco mas económica"
4,Made in Mexico?,"I have a Lee jeans bought in China and made in China, which cost me 120 dollars. This one made in Mexico only cost me 24 dollars. I mean this cheaper jeans is also in a lower quality. but no too bad"
5,"It's good jean that easy to use, and I love it very muchand also nice price.lol... strongly recommend it","It's good jean that easy to use, and I love it very muchand also nice price.lol... strongly recommend it"
2,I good 1 used,I ordered two pair of jeans. 1 pair was used merchandise. Worn cuff was noticable. Tags removed. Would not order from vendor again.
2,"Great product, but eminating odor","When the dumbbells arrived on my porch, I could smell a rubber/chemical odor eminating from the packaging. I took them to my basement gym and opon removing them, I was impressed with the construction and durability of the weights. But that odor. After a few hours, it filled the house, giving my wife and I a headache. So I moved them to the garage. After 6 weeks, the odor has ceased and they are back in my basement. The compounds used should be reconsidered."
3,Flitz,tried it on formica counter tops. dissapointing! basically just dulled the finish did not remove scratches. works well on metal though
2,I was shortchanged. NOT 2.2lbs - this is a 2lb can!!!,"Product itself is top notch! Great polish, works well, very expensive but worth it - HOWEVER - Amazon item description states that this is a 2.2lb can - the can that arrived was 2oz short, only 2.0lbs - considering Amazon sells a 1.7oz tube for almost $10 - I feel VERY shortchangedShipping package was inadequately padded - the metal can arrived totally dented up and I'm amazed it didn't burst open in transit."
2,It's ok,"The intended use for this was to buff out scratchesin a clear Stratoglass enclosure on a boat. Also purchased thekit with their large buffing ball and and a 3000 rpmdrill, as per instructions. I believe the kit package stated thiswas its intended use. Scratches did not buff out.Later tried it on some fading red gelcoat but it did notdo a very good job their either. I used it on somemag wheels and there it worked ok, but not as goodas Mothers Brand. I tried it on an anodized aluminumTuna Tower that's been turning from silver to white.There it worked good; however after about a weekyou could see it was back to turning white. In fairness,neither my professional detail people nor I have everfound a product that worked well and lasted more thena few months at most on the aluminum and we have tried many. In hindsightI should have returned this. Probably would cost moreto do that then its worth."
4,Polish,Work pretty well. I used it on my older copper pots that the bottoms had turn black. Took some scrubbing but they pretty good after wards.
4,expensive but very good,"This is the best chrome polish I have used. If you have a motorcycle it is a must. It will not remove bluing on chrome exhaust but it will remove the brown/gold color at the header. It is expensive, but if you need to polish chrome or bare aluminum its a must have .I gave it four stars because of price and some limitations like bluing ... etc."
1,Does not fit the EX V6 Accord,"I bought this to resolve my SRS light issue. First problem: clock spring arrived with a broken alignment tab, which Amazon resolved quickly. Second problem: wiring harness is missing a wire that is needed for the steering wheel radio controls. I checked Dorman's website and this is the only clock spring/cable reel listed for my 99 Accord EX V6 sedan."
4,A Heartfelt Story for Every American,"This book should be required reading for every American schoolchild at 6th grade level. The story is meaningfuland thought-provoking and without malice truly asks the question""What does it mean to be a race other than white- even partially?"" For those who truly feel that they are impartialthe subtlies of prejudice are revealed. The love and caring of the storyteller for every character in the book is ver evident-warmth radiates from every page. Read this book and embrace thewonderful American Family experience!"
4,Music inspired by ideal vacation getaway!,"Pass through to Ireland as the sounds of heritage and tradition surround you. Instruments include Scottish smallpipes, fiddle, accordion, guitar, mandolin and cello. Track List: 1. Ireland, A Waltzing Within 2. The Sickle, The Sun & A Harvest Dance 3. A Ceili for Father William 4. Baptism 5. A Woman's Lament 6. Oh, To Open the Rusty Gates of Romance 7. The Gentle Voice of Midwinter 8. The Hour Before Dawn 9. A Dublin Pub 10. The Chimney Sweep 11. She Swims at Night in the Silent Sea 12. The Tune A Fisherman Hums 13. Ireland's Waltz Everlasting. (Over 50 minutes of music!)"
4,The Virtuoso Treatment,"Unfortunately there are not too many premium orchestra versions of the Carl Nielsen symphonic cycle. To hear the Berlin Philharmonic, with Von Karajan steering the sleek beast, perform the breathtaking 4th is a revelation. Von Karajan does take some liberties with the score, going for the 'slowing down' theatrics option near the ending of the first movement, but the power and precision of the orchestra more than makes up for any transgressions."
3,This book was a gift,"Since the book was a gift to someone, I can't reasonable review it other than the say the recipient liked it."
2,Liberal commentary,"I bought this commentary because having been published by Thomas Nelson I thought it would be a conservative and orthodox one. But I was disappointed by the liberal tone of the book; for example, Genesis is considered to be a postexilic product, and Isaiah is divided into three parts (First, Second, and Third Isaiah). If you are looking for a commentary written from a conservative perspective, this book is not for you!"
4,Nicely Done,An all around great collection of important 20th century stuff. She really has a unique take on the Bartok...
4,A solid story...well told,"I read THE CRANBERRY QUEEN in one sitting. Diana's tragedy pulled me into the story and did not let me go until I had turned the last page.I've never suffered such a loss, but I feel the author really portrayed Diana's journey through the darkest hours of her grief and recovery with amazing insight.I loved the New Jersey characters and learned more than I could ever imagine knowing about cranberries and their environment.This is a character-driven book that offers rich rewards to its readers.I hope the author will write more.Enjoy!"
4,A little jewel,"I throughly enjoyed this book and found myself from the very beginning attracted to the main character and felt drawn into her life. Having lost both my parents in 2000 I could understand her feelings and moods. It gets just a little slow in the middle but not enough to discourage you from continuing on, you won't lose interest becuase the characters are so compelling.This is Demarco's first book and I hope she writes more, I like her style."
4,a sad and hauntingly beautiful book,"the 1st quarter of the book is okay but gradually picks up. i like the part where diane escape the city to a peaceful and suburban place. and how louisa criticized her for being so helpless and pitiful just bcos ""the monster"" broke up with her. when the reality is worst than she thought. instead of telling loiusa the truth, diane choose to keep the secret. it makes the readers emphatise with diane even more. the most beautiful part is when louisa's boyfriend told diane she look so sad yet so beautiful. lovely..... i swore my tear falls at that."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I was very excited to read this book. I really liked the title and the cover and the sleeve made the novel look very interesting. The story is about Diana, a young thirty-something whose life is suddenly turned upside down. The bulk of the novel is about Diana trying to cope with the tragedy in her life and how she moves on. I think this novel had a lot of potential but it didn't seem to go as deep as I hoped it would. I also thought the ending was unsatisfying for the reader. There is a lot of good information about cranberry bogs and in reading the acknowldgements at the end of the book, one can appreciate the story a bit more after learning some of the author's background. I think it was a good first novel but would have liked a bit more depth."
4,Worth the time,"This book was a quick and good read. It brought tears to my eyes several times and depicted grief in a very internalized and personal way. The characters were crafted well, each with his or her own foibles and strengths. At times, as a reader, you might not even like some of them or their actions but that is one of the positives of this book: it's realism. We are not all graceful, poised, funny, strong, likable, sensitive or honest all the time. My biggest complaint, however, is that the book finished poorly. It felt lacking at the end and tied up some characters too quickly and others not at all. Perhaps that was intentional (the author writes of hopefulness at the end but doesn't show it, which is perhaps the issue) but it didn't feel right. Over-all, I liked it, though it's not a book that will linger with me long afterwards."
3,An Engaging Debut,"This is a poignant and witty story about Diana, a young thirty-something NYC career woman who loses her parents and brother tragically in an auto accident. Having trouble working through her grief and despair, Diana drifts aimlesslessly until she finds herself one day in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey after hitting an elderly woman named Rosie with her car. While staying with Rosie and her family while her car is being fixed, Diana goes through a life-changing few days and emerges stronger and better equipped to move on with her life. While the plot is a bit predictable, the dialogue (the author is a screenwriter which is evident) is sharp and lean and the characters engaging enough to make you care about what happens next. And the depictions of the Pine Barrens makes you want to jump in a car and head there to see what all the fuss is about!"
5,Emotional turmoil,This book struck me with it's focus on a deep sadness. I couldn't help but feel the heartache and pain that Diana goes through. She has her faults but the journey she goes on is impacting.
3,Not impressed....,"This book is just, okay. There is nothing special about the authors ability. One thing i did like about this book was how very human Louisa was. Beyond her tough exterior, immediately I found a whimpering puppy."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","What a disappointment! These were characters I could never care about or relate to and a story line so absurd that I had to put the book down without finishing. So predictable! The victimized and put-upon main character! (Diana), the beautiful, troubled rebel!(Louisa--ooh, she steals cigarettes and wears leather!), the spry and oh-so-loveable grandma(Rosie--but wait, she has a secret!), the evil ex-boyfriend--all we need now is the fairy godmother...but wait...here comes the fairy godfather(Sam), so I guess all is well in the land of cliches. This book insulted my intelligence. For a book with true spirit, humor, and spark, try Emma Who Saved My Life by Wilton Barnhardt."
5,Book about life's twists and turns,"Diana is like so many of us-caught up in the frivolties of life. Unmotivated to change her life, a family tragedy changes it for her in many unexpected ways. Most of this change occurs in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey (I am still floored to learn of its existence) amidst a collection of strangers. One of which (Louisa) is undergoing her own change in life.Sad, funny and deeply heartfelt, ""Cranberry Queen"" made me take a long look at my own life and wonder what I can do be to more of an active participant."
3,Tailspin of death and love,"Life is quirky; death even more so. Nothing else can send our lives into more of a tailspin than death and love. These two themes are at the center of ""Cranberry Queen"". Diana is devestated by an accident that kills those she holds dear. This is where the novel has it's strength. The thoughts and feelings Diana has are incredibly perceptive and thought-provoking, as well as relatable. The other 2/3 of the novel are interesting as well. The rest of the story is plausible. The descriptions of the cranberry bogs are well done. But the perception seems lost. The characterization is not the strongest point, but they each of some decent dialouge. Overall the story is satisfying, a good summer read and hopefully it will be made into a good movie as well. I would rate this 3 1/2 stars."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I rarely stop reading books before the end, but I had to bail on this one on page 109. It was way too depressing! The perspective is that of the main character, but she is grieving and having random thoughts that were way too difficult to follow."
4,Blu Angel,"Blu Cantrell's debut cd, So Blu is one of the best debut albums I've heard by any singer period. Blu's debut single, ""Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops)"" put cheating men in their place. The song displayed Blu as a no-nonsense, take no prisoners R&B diva. The album tracks on this album are quite listenable as Blu expounds on love lost and found. It's R&B music at its best! I would recommend this album over her second album, Bittersweet. I hope Blu comes correct with this third album and shuts it down."
1,Blu-Hoo!,"I remember getting this CD at a used CD store. I really liked ""Hit Em Up Style,"" so I was really expecting a lot from her album. Well, let me tell you what happened next. I listened to ""So Blu,"" saved ""Hit Em Up Style"" on my computer, took the CD back to the used CD store and got my money back. For real, ""So Blu"" was lousy. Too many slow songs, too many songs about some guy breaking her heart. I don't want to hear that depressing stuff. Skip this at all costs."
4,Crazy for Blu!,I love this album! Hit em up Style has a funky jazz beat that will make you get up and dance. Blu certainly was influenced by jazz and this Providence native makes good use of it in her debut album. Every track is a winner! Buy this album if you love good R&B!
5,Ms. Cantrell is amazing...,"I bought Blu Cantrell's ""so blu"" album yesterday. The album is cool. She has an amazing voice. I love this album. I think Ms. Cantrell will be here for years to come.This album has a little of everything; from jazz, r&b, and a little pop. The album is full of slow love ballads. I urge you to get this album. My ratings on this album is 5 stars. I'm just giving her the props she deserve. Love you Blu."
2,So Blah!,"Blu has arguably the dopest voice in R&B music right about now. However the material that she sings doesn't compliment her vocal talent. 'Hit Em' Up Style' was a great introduction, but the album is so boring. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis production for the first time ever I can say was wack! It's sound like they gave Blu everything that Janet, Mary J. Blige and so on turned down.Blu has been continuosly compared to Faith Evans, and vocally I can say, she's got Faith beat. But the difference with Blu and Faith is, Faith is a better artist. While Faith can write/produce/vocal arrange, Blu just sings. It would be excused had Blu hooked up with good writers but that ain't the case either.Blu definetely has the potential to be something big in R&B but she's gonna have to get more out of her writers and producers in the future, or for her their won't be a future."
1,This cd left me cold...and blue,"Yeah, this really isn't what I expected.I loved the cool,old-school blues vibe of her single,""Hit 'em Up Style(oops), so I had high hopes for this album.Unfortunately, my very high hopes were let down.EVERYTHING on the album sounds exactly the same,(with the exeption of oops).Same beat, same theme,same vocals.Oh yeah, and her voice is NOT all that great.She actually sounds pretty bad most of the time.She ain't no diva.Bur she obviously thinks she's one, since she tries and tries to hit those high notes and hold 'em, but ends up sounding like a dead cat.This is a really dissapointing debut that does nothing for the heart,head,or soul."
2,It Definitely DOES NOT Hit You Up!!,"I rushed out to buy this cd because I thought it would be awesome. The first single was great. The rest would be too, right? Wrong!! Big Mistake!!! I'm only half way through the cd and I'm already contemplating how I can sell it back. I mean I hate to dis' an up-and-coming artist and fellow sista, but the music is so stale. The beats and the words all sound rehashed. There's no originality. I think Blu has a great voice, but the music leaves a little to be desired. So Blu is truly so blue!"
1,Same Beats annoying background,"This CD is definitely not a good CD. Only surviving by her first single, OOps...!, the same rythm and beat is repeated again and again smashing the song into pieces. It gives me a headache......"
1,"1 Really Good Song, and....that's it","Hit 'Em Up Style is an incredible, infectious, addictive song. And Blu has a beautiful voice. For that I won't become one of those bitter people who 'wish they could give this album zero stars.' But it is the ONLY song worth listening to here. The rest is made up of incredibly dull and at times just plain depressing ballads. Just save your time and money and get the Hit Em Up single."
2,Disappointing,"The first two tracks (which includes the first single) are an interesting mixture of R&B and Swing. Sure, it's a couple years too late for the swing ""revival"", but it still works well - as attributed by the single's success. This unique combination is only revisited once more, much further into the disc. Unfortunately, the rest of this album is a bland collection of average-at-best R&B/AC-wanna-be filler including silly self-referencing tracks like ""So Blu"". Blech.Too bad Arista/Blu didn't have the guts to stick with the genre-bending nature that kicks off this album. It could have been great. Instead they aimed for middle-of-the-road and hit a target even lower than that."
5,Why Waste Time With Anyone Else?,"Blu Chantrell. The caramel-skinned frosted-haired beauty from next door. She has the universal appeal.. ""sexy"" to men, ""idealistic"" to women. With her voice (which outshines that of most of the popular R&B scene right now) sweeter than the juice of a honeydew melon and songs mroe beautiful than chiffon and satin, Blu comes off as a real musician.Her songs are somewhere between dance soul and straight-up R&B. The catchy ""Why do I waste my time on you"" to the obsessive ""Hit 'Em Up Stlye"" all the way to the skillfulyl soulful ""U must B Crazy"" Blu demonstrates a wide variety of skill. She can sing, she can write, but most importantly, she can carry it all off with modesty and charm.A must-listen, one of the BEST OF 2001!"
4,Not Enough Credit!,I loved this CD. It was great. There are a lot of great beats in here and shes a pretty good singer! I honestly don't think she gets enough credit for what she does. I haven't seen her in the music biz lately but hopefully she'll come back because shes awesome at what she does. Buy this CD. Play it. Dance. Have fun! ;)
3,"a good, if underrated debut","I've had this CD for about a year, and I really love it! I think that ""Hit Em Up Style"" is a great song, but I think that she should've released a second single, instead of being afraid of Alicia Keys. I think had ""Swingin"" or ""10, 000 times"" been a single this album would've done better. But I recommend this cd to people who like real soul instead of the watered down r&b that's out there now. If you like Macy Gray, Jill Scott, Tweet, and Erykah Badu, you will definitely love this cd! If not, don't bother!"
5,Very cool,"So Blu is a cd I could play over and over again. It's very catchy and upbeat, and it doesn't get boring. Her voice is full of energy and it's so bubbly. My favorite song is 'Hit 'Em Up Style(Oops!'.) The other songs are great, too. 'So Blu' and 'Blu Is A Mood' are soft and pretty, and also have an upbeat feel to them. I didn't have to get used to this cd because I was hooked on it from the minute I put it in! This is one awesome cd and Blu can really sing with style! I definitely recommend this!"
4,hip hop be bopin 2009,"not bad at all, picking up where billie holiday left off way back in the day, this is a relief for musiclovers ..., a relief this is good real music is slowly coming back but not fast enough."
4,Blu is the woman of soul,One day i was listening to the radio at work and I asked my friend who sang that song he was like it is Blu Cantrell. I never heard of her before and he was like she is new it is an album about how her she found out that her ex boyfriend was cheating on her. The song I heard on the radio was Hit em up style (oops!. I ended up buying the album from here because I loved the songs that are in the album and Blu is going to be the next Whitney Houston. I really like this album. Blu keep up the good work. You are still an up and coming songwriter.
4,STUNNING VOCALS,"THIS CD IS A HIT IF THIS RECORDING DOES NOT PRODUCE AT LEAST THREE HITS,BLU CAN CALL ME BECAUSE SHE WILL NEED A NEW MANAGER.THE SONG WRITING IS SLICK ,FRESH AND EXACTLY IN LINE WITH THIS LADY'S VOICE.A THROW BACK TO REAL SINGING NOT JUST SLICK STUDIO PRODUCTION TO COVER MEDIOCRITY. IN SHORT IT IS THE CATS MEOW!!!"
4,Grammy Voters Missed One,"While the music industry's been patting its back for honoring Alicia Keys and India Arie, Ms. Cantrell slipped under the radar with an album that is easily the equal of ""Songs In A Minor"" and ""Acoustic Soul."" One possible reason for this is the choice of the first single. While ""Hit 'Em Up Style"" may indeed be a millenium revenge anthem, it in no way reflects the maturity, sophistication, and scope of the album. Blu moves from hip-hop to jazz to classic soul effortlessly, with vocal chops that Keys and Arie can only aspire to. ""So Blu"", ""Where Were You When I Needed You"", and ""Blu Is A Mood"" are special treats."
2,aight,"This CD is aight. You can hear in this CD that this girl,Blu can sing her heart out and she is a singer that feels every word that she sings. Espeacially when you hear track number six you know that she has gotton her heartbroken before. Track number six,""I'll Find Away"" is dedicated to anyone who eva gotton their heart broken. This song is the only reason why I won't give this CD to my cousin. I'm hoping that this CD ""finds away"" to grow on me cuz right now playlist only shows track numbers 2, 6,& 13"
3,Blu Cantrell,"I bought this album, and was fairly pleaded with what I got. Blu Cantrell delivers in her own unique style on this album. However, as far as the blues are concerned, Blu's voice is just not strong enough to pull of all of the emotions she is trying to convey. She definatley does well on ""I'll Find a Way"", but the rest of her CD is not as good. I would sugest this album only if you are a fan of mellow music, because if you think that the CD has tunes like ""Hit 'em Up Style"", you are mistaken. The CD is aptly titled ""So Blu"", because there are for the most part only sad, forsaken songs on this album. However, I was and still am pleased with the quality of this album. On a grading scale, I think I would give this a C+."
2,Not good version of these songs,"I bought this album, primarily, for ""Have You Ever Loved a Woman"". There are several fantastic versions, especially the live ones, on popular internet tube sites, and I thought I'd hear that energy in a lot of Freddy King songs. I didn't, not on this record. It's amazing how tame that particular song is, especially in contrast to the fierceness of the videos. I'm ashamed to give a negative review of Freddy King, but I would not recommend this album."
2,"Better than ""Killing Time""","I was aniticipating the arrival of this book since her last book was so bad. I will say it was better than ""Killing Time"" but not as good as all her previous books. Started out very slow-hard to keep reading it. Still waiting for something as good as ""Mr. Perfect"" and all the others!"
4,Cover of Night - Enjoyed it Much!,"I enjoyed this story very much. I thought Cate was wonderful and I loved her interaction with her children and her customers/neighbors. Cal was wonderful. I don't understand the negative reviews. Try it, you won't be disappointed.Linda Howard's never fails to take me to another world and make me feel so much a part of it. She is my favorite author!I also just finished ""Kiss Me While I Sleep"". I adored that one and didn't want it to end.Also read After the Night, Shades of Twilight, Son of the Morning, Kill and Tell, All the Queens Men, Dream Man, Dying to Please, Hearts of Fire, Open Season. I loved them all!!!!"
2,Not like Linda Howard,"Terrible, terrible writing. I am a big Linda Howard fan and this is nothing like her other books. This is like something she might've written in high school before she was published. Very disappointing."
3,OKOKOKOKOK,"Remembering that Linda Howard at OK is still better than so many writers, I can only say the book is so so. I wish I had waited for it in paperback. From the woman that wrote Dream Man, Mr Perfect, and Kill and Tell this was a disappointmentBut when Drop Dead Georgeous comes along I'll be there, no doubt."
1,skipped a lot,"This book was so dumb. Who would hold a town hostage, kill people,shoot at all the houses in the town at the same time, blow up a bridge and waite for someone to come out with a white flag to ask them what they want.Five or six of them were doing this. Why didn't they just go into the B&B again and search for the disk. Of course if he was fleeing for his life out a window wouldn't you think he would take it with him.let's see, should I take this with me when I leave for good or leave it here for them to find.Its worth millions to him or he will give it to the police. The hitmen never even tried to find him or search his room. If you want to read a book that makes no sense this one's for you. A library book, lucky me"
2,Not Linda Howard's Best,"Cate spends more time thinking about her dead husband than she does about Cal. It's hard to buy that A) he turns from a bumbling fool into a tough guy and B) she suddenly has a change of heart and falls for him. No chemistry between the two, and while you can develop some empathy for Cate, there's not any romance happening. Cal's personality is undeveloped and I certainly wasn't left with the feeling that I'd like to know more about these characters or that I got to know them at all. They could have been two people in a boring commercial.Story line was promising, but skip this one. I read many of Linda Howard's books over and over. This one will hit the donation box."
3,COULDN'T SEE A THING,Where is Linda Howard? This book was disjointed and incomplete. Had to read through 40 pages of domestic child bliss before anything took shape. Then the shape switched back and forth. He blushed; she blushed. Again and again. What is this?Trying to keep track of where the story was going and then when it appeared it was like the bad guys made such a war over a little thing - it was a farce.This book never should have been a hardcover. Get it from the library. Even the lovely cover did not make any sense.
2,He got trapped in its own snare,"First I'm going to write about the thrilling part - If it's one written in the book. This story is about a hit man. The hit man knew - because he said so at the beginning of the book- what was the trap his prey was doing, and guess what, the hit man was right and he was caught in his own snare. Give me a break.On the other hand you'll have to read pages and pages of twaddle writing to get to the book's end. LH knows how to write better than this."
2,Country Lite Thriller,"Set in a small one horse town somewhere in the mountains of Idaho, a widow opens a B&B and bonds with the small community. This book is sprinkled with lite mystery, a dash of thrills, laced with some sex and is easily read in one sitting. A no-brainer mystery."
2,Disappointing and lacking something,"I love Linda Howard books. I always look forward to her releases and this book was a gross disappointment to say the least. I think the characters are not developed well, and the relationship between Cal and Cate occurred too fast. The story was rushed and I'm sure Linda could have done much better writing on this book."
4,Coulda been worse...,"There were things I really liked about Cover of Night. The characterization was sharp, the pacing was excellent, the motivations were logical, but somehow it failed to come together and engage me. It read like a book adaptation of a movie. I never invested in the emotional life of the characters, even as I respected their situation and the reactions they had to events. The major plot point required a massive suspension of disbelief. One thing I greatly appreciated was that the suspense was without horror elements. Too many romantic suspense books of late have relied heavily on graphic and almost sexual descriptions of violence, especially violence against children. Early in the book you learn the heroine has twin boys. Right away I'm bracing myself for yet another 'children in extreme peril' storyline. I should have trusted the author more. Worth a paperback purchase, certainly. As a hardcover I'd think twice."
2,Another miss,"Tedious--too much ""telling"" and not much ""showing"" about pretty much everything, and big plot holes. A lot less exposition about Cate's worries about being a single mom and more about some of the other characters and plot developments would have gone a long way to making this a really good read. This isn't new for Linda Howard books, but strong leads (Diaz and Milla, ""Cry No More"") made up for it; not so this time."
1,I would never have thought...,"I've been with Linda Howard since Sarah's Child and the MacKenzies. Even as she branched out and eventually switched over to suspense, I followed through Kill and Tell and All the Queen's Men. But here she seems to be faltering on the dividing line between fiction, suspense, and romance. The result? A boring tale of predictable mobsterish drama. You don't get attached to the heroine, and the hero seems to be a repeat of her last 7 archetypes. Though Cry No More moved me to tears with it's power and depth, Cover of Night had me yawning before page 20. For the first time, I skipped ahead to the middle and end of a Linda Howard--never finished the whole thing."
2,The first bad Linda Howard novel,I have loved all of Howard's books except this one. Even her early stuff was entertaining. Cry No More her best.I'm willing to swallow a far-fetched plot if the characters are good. The male lead's transformation from blushing handyman to love of her life just didn't work.I'm eager to donate this one to the library.
2,disappointed,"I've been a Linda Howard fan for years and she rarely disappoints, however, this was not up to her usual standards."
4,A good story worth the time to read,"I almost didn't buy this book based on some of the negative reviews here, but I did and I will add that some of the criticism is valid, but by and large it was still a good read and worth my time. The plot is contrived. The bad guys hold an entire town siege. Several of the characters in the book agree with this. But every day we read of real life stories that are just as far fetched, so I could suspend disbelief to make the plot work for me. Ms. Howard is a talented author who consistently creates a good story worthy of reading. Her characters are not carbon copies of previous characters and she doesn't use a ""formula"" like other successful authors. Not a keeper for me (and most of hers are) but worth the time and money."
3,"Started out great, ending was rushed","This book starts out like some of the best Linda Howard has written. My favories are All the Queen's Men, Son of the Morning and Diamond Bay. In Cover of Night, the resolution at the end seemed rushed and our hero did not get a chance to be heroic. I was expecting so much more from the ending and as a result was disappointed. Still worth reading but not her best."
2,"Wanted it to be wonderful, but it wasn't!","Because I have been disappointed in Linda Howard's last few novels, I waited for this one to come out in paperback. Now I wish I would've waited to pick it up at a used book sale. Though I may be repeating what many of the other reviews here state, the plot was unbelievable, the characters not easy to relate to, and the ending much too abrupt. I miss the ""old"" Linda Howard stuff. Whatever happened to characters like the Mackenzies in A Game of Chance and Mackenzie's Mountain, and plots like those of Mr. Perfect and After the Night. Maybe it's time for some sequels of these well-established characters and interesting plot lines!!"
3,Am I missing something?,"Where are the romance and thrills? The romance was not sizzling and the thriller part was not very believable. I'm not sure what exactly it is that is wrong here but this one just doesnt have that special something that other books by Linda Howard do have, like All The King's Men, which was in my opinion one of her most memorable. If you have not read that one yet, skip this one and buy that one. Some other favorites that i have read so far this year come from Catherine Coulter (exceptional story teller), Nancy Madore (super spicy stuff that is very nicely written), and Julie Garwood (fluffy romance that sizzles)."
2,Hated it!,"Love Linda Howard, but I have to agree with others who found this plot not up to par. It makes absolutely no sense that the two ""best"" guys in this crime group, the two who always get the job done, would come to the decision to take a whole town hostage to accomplish their goal. Linda's had some weak plot elements in previous books, but they were wrapped up so well in other compelling story aspects that you could ignore it. Can't do it here. Very glad that I got this book from the library."
2,Major disappointment,"This book is a disappointment. Who is the handyman, the guide (why are they so good) Why did the mark leave the B& B through the window? Why did so many people have to die? Why block off the town? This book withheld common sense and sunk into action-action-action. I usually love this author but I want my money back."
1,Not the same Linda Howard,"I have been reading Linda Howard Novels for years. I always looked forward to a new release by Ms. Howard and would gladly shell out the price for a hard cover. The last two releases left me disappointed to say the least. Cover of Night was just awful, the plot was way beyond realistic. Ms. Howard must have had enough typed to satisfy her editor or to fill up a specific number of pages because the book just ends with a very hurried explanation. The same can be said for her two books prior to this one. Needless to say Ms. Howard has lost a fan. Don't waste your money wait for your local library to obtain it if you have to read it at all."
3,It has Lifetime written all over it,"My Title pretty much sums it up. I downloaded the Sample onto my Kindle and for some reason couldn't get the excerpt off my mind. I had read the other reviews suggesting it was a mediocre storyline, and bascially they are correct. It's an easy read with some mild suspense (very, very mild) and rather a cheesy story with light romance. Okay...it was a disappointment for me. I felt this would have made a decent Lifetime Movie but fell flat with a romance book. Especially of Howard's reputation. I rated this book three stars feeling it was ""Okay"" but if you're looking for something with sexual tension, witty dialogue and body heat you might want to look elsewhere."
2,Okay book --,"I found this book to be merely ok.... I think Cate was a snob (she even says how in her past life she would have looked down on people who did menial labor). I did not have a clear picture of Mister Harris - he seemed so uninspired (grease/dirt stained clothes, shaggy hair) - he mumbled, blushed, ducked his head.... hard to picture him turning into a super-charged hero. I also find it hard to belive that Cate suddenly starts to notice him and within 2 days is in love with him. I really think the whole hiking incident was far-fetched and just added to the book so Cate and Cal can have sex with each other-- it did not seem to really fit into the book at all. they hike all the way up there and then have to turn back?? I did find the eyeball part at the end funny - I wonder if the woman Goss slept with was the eyeball killer - and if they will run into each other again.Generally I love to read LH books and think she is a GREAT author- - but this book is NOT one of her best."
3,storyteller,I enjoyed the story through the eyes of her twin boys but especially her climbing abilities. When her town is under seige she and a handyman suddenly become super people who are able to save the town and most of the people there. I always enjoy learning new things and Linda Howard either has or did a lot of research on rock climbing. Good job!
2,WHO WROTE THIS BOOK????,"I AM SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS BOOK WAS A BIG LET DOWN. I AM A BIG FAN OF LINDA HOWARDS. I LOVED HER BOOKS LIKE ""DREAM MAN"" AND ""AFTER THE NIGHT"". THIS BOOK REALLY LACKED A GOOD STORY LINE. I MEAN HOLDING A WHOLE TOWN HOSTAGE???? I LOVED CATE AND CALVIN, BUT THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE STARTED A ROMANCE WAY BEFORE THE BOOK WAS ALMOST OVER. AND THE END OF THE BOOK???? COME ON. LINDA CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAT THAT. I WILL CONTINUE TO TRY HER BOOKS HERE AND THERE EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE THIS ONE, BECAUSE I DO KNOW FROM PRIOR READING, THAT SHE CAN DO MUCH BETTER."
3,Cover of Night,I have read all of Linda Howard's books and this one I didn't care for the ending. This was good but not one of her best.
1,It should be called Cower in Shame,"Ms Howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one. It's OK to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one. So disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious ""To Die For."" The trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time."
3,Could have been great...,"I won't lie and say I didn't like this book, because I did. There was a little crush going on for me with Cal. I wish he could be picked out of this novel and given a new story from a different author. Linda Howard seems to be a good writer, although I've yet to read one to compare to all the hype, but I'm working on that. ""Cover of Night"" seemed to start slow and end way to fast. I mean seriously, the day before Cate wasn't even sure about him and the next she said yes to marriage? Not even in a book does that work."
3,A story for a long drive,"I bought the abridged audio version of Cover Of Night. It has a very light romance mixed in with some murder & mystery. It didn't really sway me one way or the other as it was kind of mediocre, but it is definitely good to listen to while on a long drive."
5,I think it was great - maybe it is the cd version that is different,"I listen to at least 2 books per week and I like Linda Howard. It is not an Eve Dallas book - however Cover of Night was very well done. The romance was not too sappy, the thrill affect was good and the story was believable. While I scratch my head as to who in their right mind would ever move to Idaho, I suppose one goes where God wants one to go, even if it is Idaho. I have been to Idaho - the only part of this story that is unbelievable is that it happened in Idaho - nothing happens in Idaho."
3,New technique from 'To Die For'.....,"This, to me, is a new Linda Howard direction. I enjoy her books with a passion and ever since 'To Die For' came out in 2003, her characters have changed for better or worse. I was thrown for a loop at the narration change, especially with the main character. Apply that technique in 'Cover of Night' and you have charaters you either love or intensely dislike for rubbing you the wrong way. I like it, it gets the job done but I would have liked more one on one's between Cate and Calvin. His shyness was also something different for Howard and that I extremenly found appealing for the fact that its a complete 180 from her alpha males. I love alpha males but a shy one for good measure is great. Lastly, sex, only one scene! Fine and it worked with the book but that's Linda Howard-- they fluctuate from book to book and helps keep fans on their toes."
3,Liked the book until the ending.,"I thoroughly enjoy Ms. Howard's books and have purchased them without checking the reviews. While I enjoyed the book, I was disappointed that the end seemed rushed and it was not properly explained. While the idea of holding an entire town hostage to obtain information was a little unbelievable I still enjoyed the story. I was disappointed in the outcome of the situation since it left me feeling that the end was rushed and the book did not come to a proper conclusion."
3,Just okay,Not the best I've reaad from Howard but I really loved the hero and would like to see more from him. They are a bit redundant at times.
3,Mediocre for Linda Howard,"Very shallow on character development and the plot was so farfetched to be ridiculous, but it was readable which is pure Linda Howard."
2,Too Old,"These recording are just too old.Furthermore, a number of these recording have Hampton ""in"" the band and not ""up front and center"".Sorry"
5,An excellent satire on the premise Go West young man!,"This is one of the funnist books I have read and I would go back to it again and a again only some swine has borrowed it . It is the story of Pa and the twins and Holly and the narrator who break down on a new road in the middle of nowhere and build a community out of notheing but their igenuity and Pa's need to beat the Government! It has farce, satire and pathos and is very very easy to read. Enjoy."
5,old favorite rediscovered,"this is an extremely funny book, one that i read as a teenager, and just recently tried to relocate. i found a good copy and became reaquainted with this delightfully funny work by a very talented writer. i have other of his works as well, and i can recommend both this particular book and the author highly. this book is a biting commentary on modern relationships between government and the people, with the people (maybe) triumphant at the end. highly recommended."
5,Love it!,"I found myself keep going back and reading this book over and over again since I first read it 10 years ago. Richard Powell became one of my favourite authors of all time. ""Pioneer go home"" is one of his masterpiece! The story was laid out in such a genius way. You'll love it."
1,business envelops,These are not privacy type. They are very light weight and the description did not warn me that they would be this way. If I had found self seal I would have bought THEM.
5,One of a Kind,"This is a record on par with Gould's readings of the Bach Goldberg Variations, having at least as much to do with the performer as with the composer so that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Here you have Horowitz's Mozart, and not only Mozart - interpretations of a unique, sophisticated character. After hearing them you will hold each, Mozart and Horowitz, in higher regard."
5,A sublime performance.,"This is the only performance i've ever heard that does justice with Mozart's sonatas. Horowitz brings out the immensurable depth of these pieces without a trace of sentimentality.The reviewer from Hong Kong who gave this performance only 3 stars should be pityed.I have the same pieces performed by Uchida, Gould, Barenboim and Perahia. While Gould's Mozart is certainly special, Barenboim's interesting, they all pale in comparison to Horowitz.I'm sorry to say but this is a one of a kind CD in the Mozart discography."
4,"""World Cup to the Backyard"" review",Excellent tape for coaches of girls to watch and get ideas from. Many skills on the tape are achievable with practice for girls 6years and up. Tape could have been longer. World cup stars do make role models of themselves by not only teaching moves and backyard games but by relating thier growing up with soccer as kids and how it prepared them for higher competition. Tape uses kids what appears from 8-15 yrs old to show the beginning stages of learning moves. This might be the most benifitial aspect of the tape as taught moves are not mastered in a day. Tape does not emphasize the importance of warming up or stretching nor does it warn of the dangers of over training. All and all a great tape for a soccer coach to watch with his daughter. Dave Friedman(soccer coach Bridgewater NJ)
3,Easton z-bladz,"I bought these for my wife who is a slow-pitch softball player.She had a pair of these previously and loved them, as they were really good at reducing glare and also when trying to take catches whilst looking into the sun. Unfortunately they got chewed up by our puppy!By comparison, the lenses in this new pair are not as tinted as her original ones and not as dark as they appear in the product photo. However it is the start of the season here in the UK, so we will see how they work as the sun starts to shine!Other than that these glasses are light, appear to be durable and I'm told are comfortable to wear. It will be interesting to see how they shape up over a whole season!As for supply, these arrived early - much sooner than expected which was pleasing. Also price was ok, even though international shipping doubled the final price I paid."
5,Nice sunglasses,"Very good sunglasses, keeps the right amount of light out and its very stylish none the less.Weird thing: sometimes the lens come slightly off, for some reason, haven't found out why yet, but it doesn't bother me much, all you do is pop it back in and your good to go."
2,Demerits well outweight positives,"Thielemann: erratic, ranging from beautifully phrased and noble legati, to autopilot let the notes role; technically fairly polished however; Moser: generally expressive but does not compensate for his limited vocal size; Voigt: bright-toned and reasonably commanding technical traversal of the notes does not compensate for lack of personality, charisma or interpretative frisson; Holl: adequate, no more, and disappointingly cardboard in feeling. In short, well down the list of great Tristans."
2,"A small voiced ""Tristan"" with unbalanced sound","This recording is a major disappointment. Tristan's voice is not heroic, Voigt sounds weak, there are odd sound balances, AND background noise. With so many great recordings of this superb opera around, why settle for mediocrity? The whole thing is a mess!"
3,Isolde... und Tristan?,"Don't DG producers remember the title of this opera? It is TRISTAN und Isolde and not Voigt und Thieleman...What was Moser doing that night? Wasn't Heppner available, wasn't West available?It is a real pity that Moser ruined what could have been a great recordin with the magnifficent Voigt and the true wagnerian ThielemanInstead of this, I recomend the Bernstein version where Moser was just the sailor..."
1,An unworthy attempt,"This set is a huge disappointment. The 2 principal singers, Thomas Moser and Deborah Voigt, are in no way suitable for the parts, as they simply do not have the vocal size and emotional range for the music and the drama. Voigt, in particular, is a keen disappointment, as her high range isn't even free or shining, which is a must for the part of Isolde.I found Thielemann's conducting to be laborious and the orchestral performance doesn't move me at all. The quality of the recording is ok, but the interpretation fails quite miserably.I don't think this is a worthy recording of Wagner's great opera."
1,Poorly cast,"This recording is poorly cast. In particular, Deborah Voigt doesn't even have sufficient voice for Isolde. For a decent portrayal of the part, one must look to Jane Eaglen instead.The other roles are merely adequatedly taken, and the orchestral playing is unexceptional."
1,"Poor, Unintelligent, Unnecessary : Disregard","The only thing that may cause this set to be noticed is that it is Obese with Ennui. It barely registers on other, more important scales. Deutsche Grammophon has sunk deeper by releasing a product so DeVoid of life and quality."
5,hauntingly beautiful,Magical is the best word to describe this story. It's poetry as poetry was intended...to burn images in your heart forever.
4,Love and Exorcism in Latin America,"The animals live in a ""state of nature"" but thepeople live in a state of anxiety, fear and panicbecause of their myriad ""demons."" A 12 yr old girl who may or may not be possessed,sends her town into an uproar, and becomes the object (at the same time) of blind, uncontrollable love, and blind, uncontrollable fear. It sounds bleak perhaps, yet it is a funny andtongue-in-cheek book, with much wicked humorderived from the pronouncements and actions of the local officials of the Catholic Church, medical wisdom, parental ""love"", married love, lust in the dust, superstition, and book-learning. For me it did not have the impact of 100 yrs of Solitude, but GGM is older and slowing down a bit, but stilla book that is finely written (even readingin translation)."
3,I was never emotionally engaged...,The writing was beautiful - though I could tell something was lost in the translation. The author's characters are unique and vibrant - but the writing only allows us to know them from a great distance. I love the premise of the story.
4,Wonderful,"I love Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I believe my favorite is Love in the Time of Cholera, then 100 Years of Solitude,and then this one. His novels seem to ramble a lot but I love that and how poetic he is. The ending of this one was tragic but what else could you expect of him?"
4,Another great novel from Marquez,I have been a fan of Marquez since I picked up One Hundred Years of Solitude. His writing is always interesting! Of Love and Other Demons is no exception. Marquez keeps you in his grips untill the last page. A great novel!
4,Excellent!!!,I think that this was a very good book. I liked the whole book. I think it was so cool I mean even though Cayetano was so old that they still found love which goes to show that love has no age. I think that it is a good book to read. I really was suprised at the ending.
3,Brilliant Prose - Pessimistic World View,"As a published novelist, I can't help but marvel at Marquez's skill with imagry. Anyone new to his work should start with this novel."
1,One of the tapes was missing,"I didn't realize it would be cassette tapes and when I received them, one of the four tapes was missing."
2,"Marginally magical, rarely realistic","Yes, this book probably lost a star or so being read by me in translation. There's good reason - at times, the English version of the Spanish text feels like a moderately-paced plot synopsis, at others like a stack of stage directions. Surely Marquez's prose is more poetic than that.On is own merits, the book never seems to establish the right pace. Issues concerning the Marquis, Sirva Maria, and her mother (as well as other characters) are brought up vaguely and left inadequately explored. Perhaps this book would have benefited from a fleshing out of the characters and themes Marquez wanted to explore.The idea of love as a demon (especially when set against the backdrop of Spanish religious draconiansm and cruel colonialism) is compelling, but these kinds of single-metaphor investments are always a liability for onerous anticlimax. Too short to make itself poignant, too long for what it purports to show."
3,Pretty... but only one glass,The glass seems to be really sturdy. But very disappointed this was for only ONE glass... no where on this ad did it state it was for only one glass. Not sure what we will be doing with it yet... keeping or returning.
1,Not a good product,"The discription failed to say that it is a mono adapter meaning that if you are looking to hook up head phones to this, that it only will work on the right side. oh and also it is not the standard headset size, so you have to go to and get another adapter that will do the job. Im sure that you can find this same product for half that price of this one somewhere else."
3,3.5mm Headset Adapter,The adapter broke from plugging it into the phone after 3 days of use. It would have been perfect if you could leave it in the phone.
1,NOT A 3.5mm ADAPTER!,This is NOT a 3.5mm adapter as advertised!!! The female plug is too small for standard headphones. DO NOT buy it unless you have non-standard headphones (2.5mm I think) or just want to use 2 adapters.This seller just lied outright and should be banned.
3,It does what it says.,"This item, makes standard wired headsets available to Samsung customers, saving your precious brains from low-frequency ionizing radiation from your bluetooth devices. the sound quality is satisfactory, although it is a little bit muted. a caution, it is not very sturdy. mine fell apart in my pocket less than 24 hours after I received it (promptly) in the mail. Less than 24 hours after contacting the dealer, I was offered a free replacement by the dealer. Buy it, but treat it gently."
1,dont buy it!,i got it in 4 days with expedited shipping. its like it wasnt even put together. it just fell apart. dont buy it
2,Yes and no,"So I got the product at a good price. I plugged it in and used it for about a week when all of a sudden the phone adapter part just fell apart in my hand. It's not a well made product and I really wouldn't recomend getting it unless you superglue it as soon as you get it to prevent any problems.Also, DNL Enterprises is who I bought it from and they don't stand behind their products as I found out in an email discussion with them."
1,I'd give it no stars if I could...,"Fell apart as soon as I put it in the Blackjack. Actually, to be fair, it never went INTO the Blackjack! The plug-in on the adapter, pushed inside the housing. I had to open it up, superglue some stuff, and then it worked. However, superglue seeped into the plug-in portion and ruined my Blackjack's data/charging port. Thankfully AT&T; warrantied it for me. Thankfully I got this when it was $0.01. That's right, one penny. It was definitely worth ALL of that one cent. If you plan to get AT&T;'s 2.5mm and convert it to 3.5mm, don't bother, it's MONO. I made that mistake already.I'll probably shell out $50+ for a Bluetooth receiver to 3.5mm. Only reason I don't just get some Bluetooth Stereo earbuds is because I have $100 pair that sound great."
4,Works well.,This product did exactly what i needed it to do. It allowed me to plug in my earphones and listen to music through my Samsung blackjack. It was working until i washed it in the washing machine. It didn't really hold up to that test. Even before the wash the adapter was already a little feeble. The day after i received it if i moved it in certain directions i would lose sound.But for the price it was great. I should have bought 2 or 5.
2,Not the best choice,"It is a cheap adapter, and thus there is no surprise that the quality is not so good. It does not firmly fit into the mini-USB, and as a result from time to time the sound becomes very low, although it can be amended by shifting the adapter a little bit."
2,Cheap,"I purchased this adapter from Amazon as I was not able to find it at any stores in town. It is exactly what I needed. However, within 5 mins of using it, it completely fell apart, and all the wires fell out. I finally had to put it all back together and wrap tape around it, in order to use it. The company said they were sending a complimentary replacement, but I never received. :("
4,cool product but a little problem,"This came in fast and worked except for when i played music through it, the main vocals werent there except for the effects on it. all i did was open the casing and started touching wires together and realize that when two certain wires touched it worked perfect. I have ordered this exact piece before and didnt have this problem. it probably was just a defect in the i got. but still a great product."
1,STOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP,i bought hundreds of these for my a707(sync)after braking them countless times. NONE of them will last more than two months but if you want to be hard headed at least get the ones from ebay for $0.01+s/h instead of paying 8 times that and make sure you super glue it before putting it in your pocket. just switch brands because sony makes phones with the 3.5mm built in
2,NOT for a blackjack 2!!,"Even though this will show up in a search for Blackjack 2 accessories this will NOT fit in the i617 Blackjack 2. I also ordered mine from Eforcity and they weren't willing to help me get the right thing except for sending it back and basically waiting 2 weeks turn around. Unacceptable for a 3 dollar item. They were also semi rude, short, and blaming in the emails while trying to find a solution. I ended up tossing it out."
4,An asset to anyones CD collection,While this symphony is not one of Mahler's better known works I found it to be intriguing after listening to it a few times. As usual the Chicago Symphony proves it is one of the best orchestras in the world.
2,Not the best Mahler 7,"This symphony is perhaps Mahler's most difficult composition to start listening to.I think it's also his greatest one.I've had this CD for quite a while. In spite of my numerous attempts, I just failed to relate to it.I really tried to like it, but things seemed as if Mahler has played a practical joke on us.All this changed when I came across other performances...If you like collecting CDs just for the fun of comparing - this is probably a great example of how a prima vista performance sounds.Otherwise, I'd recommend Abbado's Berlin 2002 performance instead."
5,"Truly fine recording, great price","I've read more than one person write about the last movement of this symphony as if it's a problem to listen to. In a bad recording maybe, but I've heard two recordings of this symphony and the last movement of the seventh conveys an awesome sunlit brilliance. To me, it is one of the most thrilling and engaging orchestral movements in the entire Western symphonic tradition. Abbado shines throughout this performance. Overall, this is a great first pick for a reasonably priced version of the symphony. Each movement is handled with both precision and passion. Go for it!"
3,"Good supplement, not authoratative source.","It is a bit shallow as one of the others reviewers pointed out. But its coverage of EJB-QL is the best I've seen. Good piece on transactions as well. I would suggest getting Ed Roman's book for EJBs and Marty Hall's Core Servlets & JSP instead. If you want an more comprehensive coverage of servlets get the O'Reilly Servlet Programming book. Reading this book side by side is helpful, because it sheds some new light on the issues and give you a better understanding. I would reccomend this book as a reference, not as a primary source for learning."
1,horrible,"The quality of this book varies but most of it is outright horrible. The problem is that it seems to be written not by engineers but by techincal writers. People who don't really understand what is important, what is not, and how the things are connected. There are many details but the text goes on and on and on blandly through lots of useless details while paying no attention to the important things."
3,Excellent book for the bignners in J2EE,"I red this book. It is excellent one for people who start learing J2EE. There are two applications are used in this book either using ejb+jsp or webservices+jsp so you can read according to what you would like to learn if you want the topic ejb+jsp so you read chapters(1,2,3,11-16,30-34,36) and if you would like to learn webservices+jsp so you have to read the chapters (1-21)."
1,This is the worst text-book I've ever had!!!,"I have to read this text book for one of my 3rd year Computer Science course. My professor picked the worst book there is for us to learn. The exam is open book but I can't use any of the stuff that's written in this piece of sh*t. Whever wrote this book should jump off the building and die. It tried to include too many topic at once and fail to explain how to used each of them. All it does is throw you examples of the stuff they wrote. Firstly, their examples don't work. Secondly, that is not now most programmer will approach it. It tries to teach connection with a database but did not provide any PreparedStatement or Statement and did not provide text on DriverManger.getConnection. How the hell do we connect then?? Bottom line is this book sucks!! EJB, Servlets, Jsp, JMS, JNDI, XML, JDBC, JavaMail my A**!!!"
2,Too shallow and too many errors,"This book focuses too much on Sun's application server, and not enough on the concepts behind the standardized J2EE. At the same time it has a very long chapter on XML which could have been left out since there are plenty of good books and Web sites that already cover the topic. The XML chapter does not even mention XML Schema, which are replacing DTDs as the standard way to describe the layout of an XML document. Also, the book lacks a sufficient amount of code examples. There are also numerous errors in the page references in the book's index. Avoid this book if you are really wanting to learn J2EE."
1,Poorly and illogically constructed,"Many times in the reading of this book I'd find myself lost in the discussion. Then I'd realize why. While trying to explain one concept, they'd be referring to other concepts which have not yet been discussed. For example, in the JSP section (chapter 12), in trying to explain expression language, functions, etc, they kept referring to taglibs, tld's, etc, as though the reader should have a firm grip on these things. But they're not discussed until chapter 15 - Custom Tags. This was just the last straw which prompted my to write this review. But the book is full of this stuff. Also, there's no explanation anywhere of the syntax of the descriptor files such as web.xml. They simply tell you how to use deploytool to set it all up. Bottom line, if you're going to use this book to learn J2EE, you better have a separate reference library handy to clarify things. Good luck to you."
2,not a developer book,"I guess probabaly because of the aruthors' back ground (from Sun's documentation group), this book reads much like a User's Guide of Sun's J2EE SDK. It provides a couple of examples and tells you step-by-step how to compile, deploy and test these examples onto Sun's J2EE platform. There is no substantial treatment on the high level J2EE architecture, technology, and APIs. It provides little help for you if you want to jump-start J2EE programming."
1,Disfigured,While this collection could be a lot of fun it is marred by an advertisement for the collection which is superimposed in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and runs continuously throughout the program.This is a horrible practice and should not be supported. I wish Amazon would note this in their product descriptions so that folks with such little regard for this material could be avoided.
1,PIRATES,"Except for ""Long John Silver"" in Return to Treasure Island..this set is a waste of time and money!The Big E"
2,On Cukor,"While in transit there were heavy rains and the book arrived soaking wet. May I suggest a waterproof envelope for future shipments?What I have been able to salvage, I've enjoyed."
2,Not Falling for Free Fall,"My first impression for Free Fall was not good at all. I was surprised about the all the curising and profanity the author put into her work! It was horrendous. The worst part was when the boys in the story were describing a... well I won't go there! Other than that, the book was O.K. It was about four boys who are trapped inside of a cave. This is the kind of book that kept you on the edge of your seat. I especialy like the last seacne. But why am I telling you this. I don't want you to read this horrendous book anyway! Forget what I said. Forget what everyone else said. Forget that Joyce Sweeney every wrote this book. Just don't read it!"
4,Good review,"Good review, the math though is challenging for someone who has been out of school for many years. Will have to purchase more detailed review for Math. Everything else was good. Purchase for a online class I will be taking from University. Maybe with their help the Math will make sense."
3,OK,"This book gives the fundamentals on what you need to know to take the GRE, but compared to the Barron's GRE study guide I think it is inferior. I highly reccommend the Barron's GRE study guide as an excellent supplement to this book."
2,"A good ego-boost, but too easy to be good preparation","The tests in this book are too easy compared to what I have seen on the real thing. It's not bad practice, but you'll definitely need another book if you want to be ready for the hard stuff."
2,Not in Condition as Promised,"I was disappointed to look through the book today and find writing through out the book. I knew it had some wear and tear but I don't recall reading in the description that there would be writing. I purchased this item to gain additional practice, it is difficult to do so when someone has already gone through and wrote on the pages."
2,I was extremely disappointed,"Dear Amazon,I purchased the book GRE:Practicing to Take the General Test. I did receive it quite timely. I did use it to study for the GRE General Test. I did find the section on the verbal/reading comprehension/vocabulary part of the test to be useful. However, I did not like the explanations for the Math/Qualitative section. I don't know if a math professor authored this particular part of the book. I had a great deal of difficulty understanding the explanations in this math section.Therefore, I was glad I had also purchased a separate book which reviewed the Math/Qualitative section of the GRE in a more clear and concise manner. I was not very happy with the ETS version of the Math/Qualitative section in the book I purchased by ETS. Therefore, I used the other book to review my math skills.Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Elizabeth H. Roessner"
1,BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME,"I completed this whole book and it was absolutely nothing like the computer-test. The questions were so much easier in the book. For example, I was getting around a 730 on the quantitative with the review book, I ended up getting a 510 on the real exam. Now I am going to pay $2000 for a tutor because I am afraid that if I use another book it will be the same garbage."
2,Okay with reservation,"The book is okay for last minute revision prior to taking the real exam. However,the tests are quite out of date and there is only one test with full explanation out a total of eight tests.It can be difficulty to see the reasoning behind some of the answers without detail explanation and it does hinder the exam preparation. As an exam preparation book, it is incomplete and disappointing."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed with the format of this book. I have been out of school for 6 years. I found that the explanations for the math problems lacking. It appeared that the authored assumed you knew how to work the problem and didn't provide any explanation.
2,arp_review,I am not quite happy with this book.I think I could have got the contents from the GRE website. This book was not worthy for me.
2,Reservation,"The product was not represented well. The seller said the book was in ""good condition"" well in fact it was in very poor condition. The answer choices were not legible due to markings, and the passages had notes on about 85% of the pages. This was a true disappointment because I thought I would be getting a quality product.When I did contact the seller, he was very apologetic and agreed to provide me with a full refund. Since then, he has followed through and I was reimbursed the full cost. Perhaps the seller made an honest error and I hope that is the case. Regardless, there needs to be better quality control to not create mishaps such as this."
4,GRE: Practicing to Take the General Test 10th Edition (Practicing to Take the Gre General Test),"The book was in great condition. No writing in the inside and all the pages were intact and straight.The only issue I had was with the book itself. The tests at the end of the book are the same as the other editions so they're the most recent that ETS offers. However, the beginning of the book describing the test is completely outdated. The format of the actual GRE is also completely different from the tests at the end of the book in terms of how many questions there are in each section and how much time you have to complete them.If you're planning on taking the computer-based GRE, don't practice a run-through with these tests. Everything is off and you'll be taken by surprise during the actual test. BUT the questions inside are good to practice with so the book does have some value."
2,"on if you need ""time management"" practice","If you are really going to spend the time to study, this will be somewhat beneficial for practicing the timed issue. If your not looking to spend forever and a day studying, not very useful. Clear/easier/better explanations for confusing math problems can be found online. The explanations in the book are written in a ""you-should-still-remember-this,"" so if you don't remember the concepts, you will need to do some research and find outside sources. However, does out line basic concepts on the test."
3,Alot of Information but few explanations,"I like that this book breaks down some of the math terms into easier to understand chunks but you still have to know what you're doing for it to make any sense. The math review is one of the 1st sections and the area that I need the most help in and there are plenty of practice problems. You get the answers to the problems but nothing that explains how they got that answer and as for the practice tests, there are several but only the 1st one has any explanations of the answers, the rest just give you the answer key. I'm going to keep the book only because I need all the math help I can get but I'll be looking for a different GRE math book that explains things better."
2,Not the best book for info & study techniques,"I recently took the GRE and had purchased both this book and the Princeton Review Cracking the GRE ('06 edition which is virtually the same as '10 edition). ETS does contain several practice tests (most w/o answer explanation), however, I would HIGHLY recommend you purchase the PRINCETON REVIEW instead. ETS does not give nearly as good an overview of information you will need to study or study/ test-taking techniques. Also, ETS does not include very many practice test answer explanations (which you'll find to be extremely helpful). I found the Princeton Review to be more user friendly, contain more information, more test taking techniques, and more practice text answer explanations, as well as a disc for 4 online practice exams (a tremendous help). ETS is good for practice exams w/o explanations, and unless that is the only thing you are seeeking, I would highly recommend purchasing a different study guide book."
3,Quantitative Sections Not an Accurate Reflection of Actual CAT,"This is a decent book if you don't care about learning all the strategies that are the exact same as the ones you learned for the SAT. However, I found the quantitative sections were not an accurate reflection of the actual computer-adaptive test (CAT).For someone who was looking to essentially ace the math, I went through these practice math tests and would finish with plenty of time to spare (~10 minutes) and only finding the last couple problems per section challenging. Based on these tests I thought I was well prepared. Since the actual test is computer adaptive, almost every question I got was of equal difficulty to the most 5-10 challenging questions per practice set and thus more time consuming. So while solving the problems wasn't so much of an issue, time suddenly was when it hadn't been before.So I guess I should ask if anyone knows a good resource for harder math questions or practice CATs?"
5,I havent received my purchase and i want to review it,"I haven't received my purchase,GRE: Practicing to Take the General Test 10th Edition (Practicing to Take the Gre General Test)which was shipped on 5, December, 2008 till now, i want to know where is the problem, why i havent received it ?"
1,Never got my book,I never got my book! I was charged for it immediately and am still waiting for it two months later. Don't buy from them.
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"I purchased an item, and quickly realized that i already had this version of the book. I quickly sent an email requesting to cancel the shipment. The item had not been shipped or even charged at this point. To my dissatisfaction I've never been contacted, and the item remains unpacked in my living room. I've never had a problem in the past, but this makes me hesitant to order anything in the future.Ashley CHere was my e-mail request,Dear Cherrybooks,I purchased a GRE prep book from you earlier today on Amazon.com, only to realize when i got home, i own the same edition. I would like to cancel this order, and perhaps order a different GRE prep book from you in its place. Could you cancel/help me with this?Thanks,Ashley"
4,This book served its purpose,"The purpose of this book is to help potential grad students do better on the GRE and because of it, I feel more prepared than I would have if I had never bought it."
4,Practice Book,"I think is a good book for Math review and practice, but I think for analogies is not as good as I was expecting."
2,Fails to review extensively.,"I purchased this book, because I want a lot of practice. However, the first half of the book does not give enough of a refresher on math to allow me to practice effectively. In fact, the entire math section is available for free on the GRE website. Additionally, it probably makes more sense to practice taking the test with a CD than on paper, if one is going to take the computer-based test."
2,Waste of money,"With the new test coming out in August, not sure why this book was still for sale. Since the structure of the test has changed, just consider using the book as a knowledge builder not really good to practice the exam. Real disappointed in Amazon."
1,stay away,"I'm a GRE and GMAT math prep tutor, and I've gotten 800 on the GRE math section. This book is out of date and misrepresents the GRE entirely. The questions are based on tests of ten years ago, when the test was considerably easier. Today, on computer, the test uses questions of considerable difficulty to weed out students, and this book does nothing to prepare people for that reality. I expect people who study solely from this book to be completely surprised by the difficulty of the test.If you're looking for a good way to study math on the GRE, I recommend studying the questions from the GMAT book published by ETS - the Official Guide 10th Edition. The questions in there are much more realistic and still legitimately written by the test-writers..."
5,Good Study Tool,"I just took the GRE and did pretty well, considering my vocabulary isn't the best. I wouldnt reccomend this book for its strategies, but because it has 8 old tests so that you can get a feel for how you will do on the test, and be able to determine where to focus your studying on. I found that my actual scores corresponded with the ones that I got after taking these practice tests.If you want some help with strategy I would suggest something by the Princeston Review, I found them more helpful than Kaplan. Good Luck with your studies."
3,Good Math Practice,"I needed LOTS of math and quantitative practice, so getting this was mildly helpul. By far, I thought Barrons Pass Key to the GRE was much better for building quant skills. But, realizing that this is paper-based and the real test is computer-based, unless you seriously need boot-camp on the math then skip this book and get something else. It's not ""better"" because it's made by ETS, don't be fooled by that. I got the most help from Barrons and from a book called The Ultimate Math Refresher. The ETS book was really just more sets of practice problems, because I did so many. My first GRE was 55% quant, and second was 71% -- so the practice and studying helped. I think, for me, Barrons was the best because they helped me with my personal albatross -- quant comparison questions."
3,Only the Practice Tests are Useful,"I've rated this book at three stars not due to the quality of its content, but for its actual benefit per cost.If you are planning on going through actual paper-based tests to drill and familiarize yourself with the types of questions on the GRE, and don't have any other sources of paper-based tests, this book may be helpful.As for the other sections, which contain sample questions with explanations, a math review, and information and samples of the new analytical writing section, all of these are also available for free on ETS' website in PDF or html format.So, realize in purchasing this book you are paying for seven paper-based practice tests."
3,"Good, but could be better","I started out my preparation with this book. I needed a lot more prep work than average -- I've been out of school a while.The math review was good, but the exercises (for the most part) were not like the actual GRE. Meaning, they were not multiple choice -- you had to solve the equation/problem completely. Then if you got it wrong, it wasn't explained to you how to correctly solve the problem. Not a big deal, but it doesn't help you learn how to use the 5 multiple choice answers in order to solve an equation. Other books teach you to use what info IS given to you, to help eliminate answers.The verbal and analytical writing sections were good, but it helps to have been a lifelong reader. That is the only way the build a vocabulary in order to beat the GRE.Also, this book is available at many public libraries. So buy Barron's Passkey to the GRE here on Amazon, and use ETS' book for a reference."
4,Great Study Guide,"This was a great study guide and better than any of the other books I tried. It's written by the people that make the GRE and has a great review for general math, algebra and geometry along with quizzes and practice exams. The only con I could think of was that the book just gives you the answers for the quizzes and practice exams and doesn't work the problem out or explain how it arrived at that answer. Overall, it is a great study guide, especially for the price."
3,GRE Practice Book,Helpful in knowing what type of questions to expect on GRE. Can't say much beyond that. I will not know until after I take the GRE how helpful it really is.
2,Maybe the third GRE book to buy,"Purchase the Princeton and Barron's GRE prep books first. There is still some useful information here, but the practice questions are way too easy to be considered more than just a introduction to the test."
1,False advertisement!,"False advertisement!I paid $68.84/w shipping for this DVD ROM Drive which was passed off as "" BRAND NEW ORIGINAL PHILIPS DVD REPLACEMENT DRIVE - 90 DAYS WARRANTY."" What I received was a Remanufactured Drive. (Used) I have the photos of the Remanufactured stickers from YOBO on the sides and sticker that was removed from the top of drive, And date of original manufacture of drive. The drive had some dirt and tool marks on it and a hair just inside the door! This is false advertisement! I would like to alert anyone thinking of buying from this dishonest seller! Sold by:Excess Source"
2,This book is useless,"I bought both this and Point It by Dieter Graf. Point it is a MUCH better book, Wordless .. borders on the childish and is really not a serious attempt to overcome language barriers. I found Point It much more helpful. It is well designed and covers a wide variety of items and occasions and is a much better buy."
1,"Not what I expected, poor quality all around",The book is small in size which is its only good feature. The pictures of the items you are supposed to point to are much too small and most are not very clear. Very disappointed in the quality of the paper. Most definitely would not recommend it.
5,Power to the Grandmother-People!,"What an inspiring, enlightening, and delightful book this is! I am old enough to recall the Gray Panthers movement and Caprow's ""happenings;"" the raging grannies appear to manifest the best of both. They show us how to work for peace and social justice by abdicating our stereotypical roles as nice, invisibile older women, by using courage, creativity, and outrageousness to get results. I bought this book because I am doing a Ph.D. dissertation on older women as agents of social change, and expect to quote it frequently."
2,It fell apart just walking around with it,"The black holders at the bottom all weren't glued on and I went to try it out and when I left I didn't notice they all fell off until I got home. Then it has some metal weights in the middle which I though okay at least I have those, next time I try it out again all of those fell off, and I thought I'll glue it together. Then I was thinking NO i payed $30 for this product it should be in good condition and not falling apart. I mean I guess it's usable, but I haven't used it since. It'll probably just fall apart on the next few kicks if it can hold the ball up still."
5,Awesome,My son received this for christmas and he loves it. He is outside all the time playing football. This item saved me from being accidently kicked...lol
4,It works.,"It works,when my son has to work out,and I'm not there to help, he can get a full half hour of field goal kicking in by himself. Wilson makes very good quality products for football and this is one of them. We haven't had it long so time will tell."
3,it work(ed),"good stand, lasted a year, then fell apart.used by 13 year old occasionally during that time."
4,Neat Calendar Featuring Chocolate Labrador Retrievers!,"While I do not personally have a Chocolate Labrador Retriever padding around my ten acres of sylvan splendor yet, I do hope to somehow garner one for the pack sometime soon. Meanwhile, I can plan ahead and grab myself a great 2005 calendar that is devoted exclusively to Chocolate Labs! It is a nice change of pace, and for people like me who love Labradors, you can never have too many of a good thing, although when I had six dogs late in the 1990s I was perhaps approaching the borderline of the limits to the tolerable. At least my lady friend at the time thought so; hehehehe.. At any rate, it is indeed a lovely calendar, one filled with great shots of beautiful dogs, and one that is perfect for an inexpensive gift for that student or friend who could use a little touch of whimsy and wonder in their daily life. Enjoy!"
5,Helpful overview to get everyone on the same (ROMI) page,"Sometimes the details make us lose sight of the bigger picture and the fact that we have to show a return on investment. Proving a Return on Marketing Investment has become mandatory. Guy's book is easy to read and can be used with an entire team to make sure they subscribe to the same values, in this case delivering ROMI. It requires no previous knowledge of management accounting. If you are looking for a deeper mathematical approach, you will need to find additional material."
3,Good for business marketers,"Book wasn't bad. It helped in terms of organizing how to look at marketing ROI. It doesn't handle branding issues very well, but in B2B marketing that shouldn't probably be the focus. We need to understand how to rank and choose programs and found this a good way to start evaluating them."
1,simple? yes. actionable? no.,"in a world where every marketing dollar invested should count, marketing roi is becoming more and more ""basic"" in the companies' operational procedure. that is a given.the premise of this book is that ""marketing roi is important"". the author conceptually introduces marketing roi, hammers on and on about its importance, and offers possibilities of measurements. if you are looking for a ""what is marketing roi"" and ""why is marketing roi important"", this is the book for you. but if like me, you've already been awakened - rudely or gently - to the importance of marketing roi and its possible contributions to your business and are looking for ways and means to effect significant changes in your organization, this is not the book for you. this book is more of a PR work for the author's firm than a book that seeks to contribute to its readers' coffers of experience."
3,Good for beginners,"I admire Mr. Powell for tackling a subject that is ignored at many corporations - how to add accountability to branding with hard numbers instead of the ""soft"" metrics like ""creativity"" or ""impact"" that unfortunately drives a lot of branding today. For that reason alone, the book is worth reading. However, if you are already working to quantify your branding efforts, the book is a little simplistic. It amounts to little more than a long discussion of the common financial concept of IRR (internal rate of return). If you are familiar with basic accounting concepts, this book will represent familiar ground. If not, then it is a good introduction to the metrics required to determine whether a marketing investment will pay off."
1,"Bad theory, errors, theoretical with little practical impact","Enormously disappointing, not at all what I expected, no way that this could be put into practice - erronous theory, weak examples.Even the central idea is flawed. Ratios should almost never be maximised (see Argenti, 1980 for a simple, clear explanation), and ROMI certainly shouldn't. The examples of spreadsheets in the book are simplistic and in some cases misleading. With lots of white space and wide margins the content of this book is very light, probably equivalent to 100 pages. The key issue of where to get the elasticities, and other parameters is glossed over, leaving the reader wondering how to implement this in practice.Suggested reading:- Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949)- Customer equity (ISBN: 0875847641)- Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847)"
2,Value of ROMI,Though measuring the return on marketing investment has a great deal of value to any organization the value of this particular book is for Guy Powell to claim he has authored a book on the subject. What you will not find are suggestions of ways to attribute sales to particular campaigns regardless of the length of the sales cycle. You will find statemnts indicating the importance of doing just that.
3,A little bit too superficial,"I agree with the review above entitled ""simple? yes. actionable? no"". However, the 1-star rating given by the reader is a bit tough.The book does give a good overview of ROI tracking. There are a few good tips. However, the author never addresses in-depth topics related to the complexity of tracking ROI. I was expecting more. I've already worked on ROI analysis and haven't learned much from this book.If you're a beginner, or have just started to work out ROI for your marketing campaigns, it will be useful (4-star).However, if you've already tracked and analyzed ROI in your company (and hopefully you already have!), then paying $25 or so for this book is not that good a ROI (ahah!). Although I did pickup a couple of interesting thoughts which still made the book worthwile for me (average ROI at other companies, how to use the accounting department for better ROI tracking). Don't expect much though."
4,Great book of great quotes.,This book has it all. Quotes that will make you laugh and others that will make you think. You'll recognize many of the names and will never have heard of others. But rest assured that when you put this book down at the end of the day you'll feel a little more inspired.
1,It's Junk!!,"Bought the compressor/nail gun combo. As in the previous review, oil had leaked everywhere, The drain valve was broken and the pressure guages bent. Got it cleaned up and put in new oil. The compressor worked for ~8 hours and failed - won't even come on! The gun seemed to work well, but can't use now. Don't waste your time and money on this - you will be dissapointed when you need it to work and it fails!!"
4,Works fine for me,"I bought this kit in November (I think) and it has worked fine since then. It arrived without issue, and started up fine inside. The gun has worked fine as well, though it does kick a little bit much (a star off) it has not had any serious problems, as long as one oils it regularly. The compressor was a little finicky in cold weather, but heat it up (to around 55F or so), and it will do just fine.Edit: Still working great...both the nailer and the compressor, though I have found that the compressor likes to be warm to start (when sitting outside, usually under non-ideal powering on older homes). After it has filled, I have had no problems with it cycling."
4,Helpful Resource for the Wannabe Green Gardener,"This book is an enjoyable journey--and tribute--toward a better world. Written by Sandbeck after the 9/11 tragedy, she wrote this book with the purpose of creating a safer environment, beginning in our own backyard. At times, this book is whimsical; at times, it is philosophical. But the theme of greener living resounds throughout. A very thoughtful and thought-provoking read for those of us that want to be more eco-minded."
2,DVD No.Company YES,"The actual DVD was not impressive to me,there was not enough variety in the program, in other words repetitive. A little boring. There would not have been any way of knowing this, unless the DVD had been previewed,which it was not.However the company who sent it, were excellent, since upon telling them I was not impressed with this DVD, they immediately offered to return my money.The DVD had been viewed and as yet I have not known many companies who would have offered to do this."
1,WHAT?,Hahaha worst video ever. She is so awkward!!! Nothing can be learned from this at all. Only how to watch this lady give the worst examples ever. Pretty smile though.
1,This sucks,There's no nudity. The whole movie looks like it was shot by a Sony Handycam(R).... Terrible instruction by a not so attractive lady. She's wearing a fullbody leotard under her outfits the whole time.
4,"Good Item, Bad Customer Service",This product works great and is built very well. Do not buy from True Value though!!! They sent me the wrong size and customer service would not help me and never returned any phone calls. I had to resort to cutting it down to size myself! I strongly recomend using a differnt seller.
5,Exactly what we needed,"Love this gate, it's exactly what we needed for our windows since they are very low and our 2 toddlers can fall/climb out. Sturdy & strong and good quality, although I would probably try and find it locally since the shipping rate is very expensive because it's so heavy."
1,Shipment just Received,"One of the side pieces is defective meaning that it has to go back. Also, this furniture does not come with the daybed spring."
3,Super Reader,"The Rat gets busted robbing a mint, and gets put on trial for his life. His only problem is that the trail comes after the execution.However, the League has a job for him, and used the Life Model Decoy gambit to get him out of it, and promptly poisons him.He has to track down an alien artifact on a prison planet. So, as a cover for being a prisoner type, he forms a rock band, the Stainless Steel Rats, natch.An extensive send-up of Iron whassisname in the woods guy in the latter part of the book, as well.Amusing as usual."
3,Outrageous Reviews,"The Stainless Steel Rat is not to be mocked. This man knows where you live... This book is, just like the other books excellent. I have read all of the SSR books, in and out of order and this one holds up just as well as the others. Dont just buy this one, buy them all. Bolivar"
4,Rat Fans REJOICE!,"Whaddaya mean this is the worst of the bunch? Now, I'm a serious rat fan; I've read almost all the SSR books, and this one fits in very nicely! It's got a fairly good plot, altheough characters don't really need to pop out of nowhere like that."
5,Read this book!,"I first read Carlson's book about 3 years ago, and since then have re-read parts of it and given copies to friends who were struggling with the aftershock of suicide.The title may be a little misleading; though I initially read the book because of a suicide, I discovered later that it could apply to any death that a reader may be coping with.This guide addresses not only the grief and angst of suicide, but also deals with the minor details we may never think of until we really need them: What do you say to a grieving parent? Is it best to not say anything and avoid bringing up hurtful feelings? What about holidays and special occasions?I found the book extremely helpful and enlightening. The hard-learned lessons that made the book possible shine through on every page. Carlson writes from experience and from the heart about a subject most of us are ill-prepared to deal with. I highly recommend this book."
5,I Highly Recommend This Helpful Guide,"I first read this book about 4 years ago, and since then have gone back to look at passages that were particularly helpful to people struggling with the aftershock of suicide.The title may be a bit misleading; although it's about suicide, it's also applicable to any death that a person may be dealing with. Carlson's book addresses not only grief and anxieties associated with suicide, but also the little details we don't think of until we really need them: What do you say to a person in grief; how do you handle anniversaries and special occasions when someone is surviving a loss, etc.I found this book helpful and enlightening, especially knowing that Carlson learned all these details through experiencing a significant loss in her family through suicide. She writes not only from experience, but also from her heart. Technical how-to's are a dime a dozen. This one's different."
3,Parent/child and adolescent focused,"This is the first book I have read about suicide since my sister's suicide about 5-6 weeks ago. Just a warning to others that Carlson's book is far from a generalist's view on suicide. There is a heavy concentration on identifying depression in youths and adolescents as a way to stem potential suicide risk. As a result, I ended up breezing through several sections that I just didn't find relevant. Other major concentrations in the book discuss parent/child relationships though for very young and adolescent children but again, not too relevant to my situation."
3,"Good First Novel, But Not His Best",Good novel of the knights of the air in World War I. Story of a British squadron of fighter pilots in SE-5s. Like his much better Piece of Cake (RAF in battle for France and battle of Britain) almost half of book is taken up by training and mess antics. Great dialogue but not much action until second half of book. Some dogfighting. Not as much as I'd like to have. Squadron Leader Wooley character reminds me of personality of Sgt. Stryker in Sands of Iwo Jima. Very tough on his charges but utterly determined to get them home safe from the war. Worth a read but definitely not Derek Robinson's best book.
4,Daughter's science fair experiment ...,"We had to get this at the last minute (since The Wife got a totally wrong kit from a local science supply place), so ended up spending more on shipping than the product. Again, it was being used to test bottled water, so most of the functionality of the product was unused."
2,Ugh.,"I was disappointed with this book. I thought that it was going to be a wonderful book about Madam C.J. Walker. When I got it in the mail, I was shocked to see that it is more like a childrens book. I had no clue! It tells the story, but none of the facts. I only wanted it because I'm studying cosmetology. Oh well, it was only 5 dollars."
2,Space Sand Falls Short,"I have ordered ""space sand"" from other suppliers that worked much better. This product did not repel water as well as the other products. I would not buy this again or use it in my science demonstrations. I was very disappointed."
4,Interesting,"This is a great product that does exactly what it says it will do. However, it leaves a funny , film-like, texture to your hand. Also, if you leave water on it (ex. accidentally leave water in the container), it will start turning the water yellow."
3,Messy,"It's defiantly interesting. Short lived though. Put it in the bath tub with my daughter once, and immediately realized I had made a mistake. It eventually turned into little tiny clumps under the water and then a thin layer of it floating on the top. I didn't want it to all go down the drain so I had to spend some time using a little screen thing to sift most of the sand out of the bath tube before draining the tub. I pulled her right out of the water because I was unsure exactly what it's made of too. My mistake. Haven't played with it since."
2,Fabric very gentle and not durable,"This tent is very light, for the trip I was planning weight was a huge factor. The fact that it was on the cheaper side made me like it even more.On the first trip I used it - only setting it up caused several holes in the fabric.The fabric is real thin and delicate it is only single layer and it is far from being durable - something we all expect from camping equipment.Unfortunately for me this was a stormy night and the whole tent kept trembling and flapping - Might be suitable for summer camping on a beach (soft surface)."
3,Don't buy this tent.,"I purchased this tent from Amazon one month ago. When my husband set up the tent, we found the actual size is much smaller than it should be. We measured the floor size for this tent. It is 7'3 X 4'10 (221X147cm), the size for Lite'n Up 2 rather than Lite'n Up 3 with size 7'6 X 5'11. It made you feel like you bought a queen-size tent, however Amazon sent you a full sized one. I called Amazon customer service, I was told to sent back this one and buy another Eureka Lite ' n Up 3-Season 2-Person Tent from Amazon. However, the new one arrived last week still is a Lite ' n Up 2-Season 2-Person tent. I trusted Amazon all the time and spent thousands of dollars there. I have to say I am very disappointed."
2,Not as durable as my other Bosch products,"I am a remodeling contractor and have used Bosch for over 10 yrs. I've been (at least) satisfied, and mostly very happy, with every tool (I own about 8). I have a couple of tools on the 14.4 volt platform so I purchased the flashlight about 6 months ago.I have not broken it, but the flashlight seems flimsy in your hand without the battery. The switch works well. The swivel head is somewhat useful but difficult to aim. The light is fairly bright, but in the first 3 months I burned out both bulbs that came with it. It would be useful if the light could be focused from spot to flood.For me, the measure of a good tool really comes down to whether or not you find yourself reaching for it when you need it. Although I find that it still gets dark here on a daily basis, I set this one aside about 3 months ago. I am considering the DeWalt fluorescent worklight. I really wish Bosch would add a tough, bright fluorescent to the offering. I'd try that in a heartbeat."
2,Cuthbert Grant of Grant's Town,"Not a source for research, it reads like a novel not a work of nonfiction"
2,"excellent soloists but funereal pace irritates, not inspires","The previous reviewer is correct when he rightly cites the quality of the soloists as a positive aspect of this version of the 9th. They are indeed top-notch, but the excellent choral singing and soloists are not sufficient to redeem this performance. The pace is funereally slow, so slow that it does indeed increase the dramatic tension, but not in a manner that adds to the performance. In fact, I became tense to the point of irritability trudging through this marathon! This most magnificent of symphonies should uplift the spirit and make the hair on the back of your neck stand up! It should not irritate or bore the listener. For the best Ninth, try Bernstein, Karajan (1976) or Solti's version instead."
4,There Are Better Slow 9ths,"I was somewhat disappointed upon hearing this. I own 28 versions of the 9th, and this one somehow eluded me until I bought it on Amazon for 39 cents.First thing is the sound. Warning: early digital recording on DG. Recorded in 1980, it lacks the depth of sound and detail that mars so many early 80's recordings.Yes, it's slow. And there's nothing wrong with that. But here, the recording is simply not compelling. Missing are drama and tension -- or even detail in phrasing. There are much better slow 9ths. Try Solti's with the CSO on London, especially the ponderous yet dramatic first movement. Yes, mid-80s digtial, but better than the Bohm DG sound."
4,Interesting layperson read - not a good justification,"An interesting look at why we are jealous from an evolutionary perspective. Find out why jealousy is necessary for reproductive success for both genders. How do men and women differently express their jealousy? Why are some of us more jealous than others? And why does jealousy vary from relationship to relationship?This book does a good job at developing a theoretical framework for jealousy, and it also gives you tools to evaluate the possible biological causation of your possessiveness in relationship. I feel that this is where its biggest strength for me lies, as it allows me to think further and transcend the way my genes have evolved.My only qualm with this book is that is dances the line of positive and normative science, going a bit too far to justify jealousy with evolutionary accounts. Don't let the naturalistic fallacy convince you that this sort of ugly behavior is okay."
4,A helpful read,"I bought this book when I was struggling with my own jealousy issues in a past relationship. As it turns out, my feelings and thoughts were well validated by Buss's research. Humans are genetically predisposed to a certain amount of jealous feelings about their partner, and are almost programmed to react to real and perceived threats to the partnership. They key is to ascertain the validity of such perceived threats and to maintain control of one's reactionary behavior. And of course, as the title suggests, a certain dosage of mutual jealousy is almost necessary for attraction and passion to continue and are actually a healthy part of a committed relationship.The overall read was interesting and kept my attention well. I have already cited my new knowledge and recommended the book to friends."
2,Hm..,"As a newcomer to the field of evolutionary psychology I can't help but marvel at how the old biological determinism is coached in the (equally old) language of male biased ""scientific truth."" Buss's newest book seems no exception. Only two stars. Somehow the evolutionary advantage of killing the straying female escapes me (but then, I'm not male, nor an evolutionary psychologist) - as do other ""scientific insights"" on the female/male behavior. Judging by the gender of reviewers and their enthusiasm, this book greatly appeals to males (small wonder). But, forgive my naive question - what's the evolutionary benefit of being an evolutionary psychologist who, instead of investing in propagation of his genes, writes books which make him unpopular with females (thus reducing his reproductive success)...?"
4,On the money,"I first ordered this book to help me overcome jealousy. When I first started reading it, I soon found out the book explains jealousy and why it exists, rather than teaching you how to overcome it. I learned that my jealous feelings were somewhat justified, and normal. This book was painfully truthful: it hit the nail on the head in regards to my marrital situation at the time."
4,late 40's Basie,"Some people tend to ignore the late 40's period of the Count basie big band. There's plenty of good music here, although the high energy swing may be lacking in a lot of the tracks. After all, this was the rhythm and blues period, and the Basie band reflected the times. There are some great Jimmy Rushing tracks and some mellow blues instrumentals, but the band still swung like only they could. Any Basie fan won't be disappointed.Just a quick update. The first 5 tracks are from Basies' Benny Moten period and recorded in the early 30's. You can hear the origins of the Basie sound!"
1,Worst headphones I ever had,"I bought this headphones to go with my new A1200 with the purpose of using it as an MP3 player. But this headphones are terrible for listening music. The sound quality is not even acceptable. They do the job for phone calls, although the quality for this is barely acceptable.I'm very disappointed with this product. Don't buy it if you want it for listening music."
1,Don't waste your money,They sound bad and don't fit very good in your ears.Five minutes after opening these I knew I threw my money away.
4,A Good Read on the Subject But Fairly Technical,"In a lot of science books written for the general reader, the complaint is that the material is sensationalistic and over-simplified. Edward Bryant almost errs in the other direction. His evidence that very large Tsunami have played a key role in shaping many coastal regions is extremely well-presented and will contain lots of new information for even dedicated followers of Earth Science news.On the other hand, while reading information about landscapes re-arranged by truly massive ""mega-tsunami,"" one sometimes longs for livelier prose. The book may also be something of a slog now and then for people with no background in Earth Science.I would recommend this book highly to anyone with a serious interest in the subject, and certainly to anyone who needs to consider tsunami from a policy-making point of view."
2,Less of a value than the paint spinner,"I bought this because my son absolutely LOVES the paint spinner. This is the same basic plastic base with an adjustable size spinner wheel to hold the ceramic pieces. However, the ceramic pieces sit much higher in the spinner than the paper would - meanwhile the ""splash shield"" sits at the same height, leaving zero protection against the spraying paint. Also, the paint provided is in MUCH smaller and less user-friendly bottles than the paint spinner bottles. The ceramics supplied are cheap - to be expected - but VERY cheap, and the square plates which are supposed to be hung with a ribbon through pre-cut holes do not have holes. It comes with four square plates and four very small circular plates and then - it's done.Stick with the original paint spinner and order some refills. This is not a valuable addition to the toy closet."
1,Like Rabbits mating,"I find this performance by Alexis Weissenberg to have but one fault; The recording itself. He plays it far too fast. The impressionistic/contemplative style that Debussy's works are written for is totally thrown away. In its place is a work totally devoid of personality, and mechanical. My greatest pet peeve when listening to an artist's rendition of a classic is the seemingly ubiqitous, but subtle need to quicken the tempo, as if speed were the transcending value of a performance. These melodies are almost sacred! Speed freaks should not track mud over them to perhaps, make a name for themselves for acheiving a newer ""interpretation"" of it."
2,One of R&B's best kept secrets.,"I do agree with another reviewer that Canadian native Deborah Cox is one of R&B's most underrated singers. I was extremely dissapointed and angry at Clive Davis for underpromoting her (he even dropped her from his label J Records!) when she actually has a better voice than labelmate Whitney Houston. ""One Wish"" is a great contemporary R&B album featuring some Hip Hop (""One Wish"" featuring Snoop Dogg), Jazz (""I Won't Give Up""), Adult Contemporary (""One Day You Will"") and straight R&B (""Nobody's Supposed To Be Here""--originally written for Patti LaBelle). Her voice is phenominal. She can softly whisper like Mariah but also belt out like Celine. A lot of the songs have potential hit. Another favorite of mine is the mild Urban hit ""We Can't Be Friends"" featuring Next group (also an underrated R&B act) member R.L. Overall if you liked Deborah's radio hits I strongly reccomend this album. I really think it's her best. Overall grade: B+"
3,Good,She really reminds me of Toni Braxton. Her looks and her voice. If you like Toni you will love this.
2,One Wish; I Wish I had not Ordered It,The product arrived safely and in relatively good shape. The content was what I had anticapated and the very reason it was ordered. I believe it can be assumed that I enjoy the DVD/CD(s). You probably have figured out that I strongly dislike being made to write these reviews. I can see reviewing a book or a product that is being tried for the first time.
4,I disagree!,"To the reviewer who said ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here"" was a ""disapointing attempt"", wake up! That song is phenomenal and Deborah's voice is better than most of the artists on the R&B scene. The duet with R.L. from Next is also powerful. I know of very few young artists that can evoke an emotional response time and again from one song, let alone two on the same album."
3,"GOOD EFFORT,YET CAN DO MUCH ,MUCH BETTER","I ENJOYED DEBORAH'S SOPHMORE ALBUM A LOT.SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL STRONG VOICE THAT MAKES HER STAND OUT.YET I WAS SORT OF DISSAPOINTED.UNLIKE HER FIRST ALBUM ,THIS ONE LACKS THE USE OF HER TRUE VOICE.HER HIP BEATS COVER SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS,BUT I WOULD RATHER HER MORE SONGS WITH HER SINGING HER HEART OUT.A VOICE LIKE HERS SHOULD BE HEARD,NOT SWALLOWED BY SAUCY BEATS.BESIDES THAT I TRULY ENJOYED THIS CD AND IT IS A BUY.I JUST HAD ONE WISH:LOUD AND POWERFUL IS GOODAND GIRL YOU AND I KNOW YOU GOT IT."
3,Good but not my style.,I actually bought this CD for the last two songs since they had the dance version that I liked. By the time I got to the last two songs I was able to get a better feel for Deborah Cox music. I am more on the house and dance side of the music so some of the tunes were a little too emotional for my taste especially the first three songs: 1. September 2. It's Over Now 3. Nobody's Supposed To Be Here My favorites were: 11. One Day You Will 12. Nobody's Supposed To Be Here - (dance mix) 13. Things Just Ain't The Same - (dance mix) The rest was good listening but not my style. Good Listening.
2,just ok,"It reminds me of Angela Bofill, who sounded great when she sang at low volumes, then the song went into the dumper when she went too far over the top. There are a few songs that are ok if you want to wait for it to go in the bargain bin, but you probably won't play it much."
2,I guess all these people can't be wrong....,"....or can they? I don't want to knock a talented artist. Some of the songs are ok, but there's a lot of yelling, which doesn't do justice to a voice that is otherwise pleasant enough. If you want a cd that makes you want to play it over and over pick up something by The Whispers, Phil Perry or Randy Crawford. ....not this one. Sorry Deborah, no offense, but its just not quite there."
4,TOO DARN GOOD!!!!,"I wasn't a big fan of Deborah Cox until I heard ""Nobody's Supposed To Be Here"". When I first heard that song I was floored! Deborah did her THANG on that song(I was also impressed to find out that Montell Jordan wrote it!) It is so refreshing to finally be witnessing female R&B artists such as Deborah and Kelly Price who can really and truly SIIIING! I am tired of hearing whiny lil anorexic adolescent girls trying to be soul Diva's! I am loving this album! ""Love Is On The Way"" is one of the HOTTEST slow jams around! R.L. (from NEXT) guest stint on ""We Can't Be Friends"" is lovely..he and Deb have vocal chemistry. Deborah has IT ALL...slamming voice, range, stunning looks. This is her time to SHINE!"
5,One Wish,"I remember this album when I was in the 6th grade. I fell in love with the album especially the hit single (Nobody's Supposed To Be Here). Deborah experimented with incorporating these new elements into her musical style. One Wish is a perfect mix of different influences-old-school R&B,hip-hop,gospel,dance,and jazz. This album is a tremendous growth from her gold debut album. This album has been certified Platinum. Remember,this was 1998-1999."
1,Cheap,"I ordered this because it said HEAVY DUTY use, figured it would be a great tape dispenser, boy was I wrong should have known better because of the price, cost more to ship this piece of sh** than it was worth, so NO I would not recommend this not even for home use. it is JUNK..oh and it also said 2pk, So I thought I would get 2 but did not get 2 only 1 not that 2 would have made a difference it is still JUNK..Roger"
5,Excellent food for our guy's sensitive tummy,"My Basenji mix puppy had a sensitive stomach. Started him on Iams Smart Puppy, then tried Innova puppy; very runny (sometimes watery) poops. After all tests came back clear, our vet wanted to start him on prescription foods. I had read good things about CN Lamb & Rice and decided to try one more commercial brand of kibble. Good move. He's been on it a few months now. He loves it, and clearly it agrees with him. We mix in a little pumpkin and water to spice it up a bit. More expensive, but I feel it is worth it. Highly recommend!"
4,Stock up now,"There are only limited replacements sets available so stock up now. O-rings last for years but the next time they wear out there will probably be no replacement sets available for purchase and you will have to replace the entire valve set. Make sure you install the cold and hot stops on the correct side. When I had them reversed, the shower leaked. I replaced the O-rings again but they still leaked until I swapped the stop again. The set does not contain O-ring grease which should be used to avoid pinching the O-ring during operation."
1,"Fine Orchestra, Fine Conductor, Poor Miking/Mixing, Indifferent Performance!","My title sums it all up. DG's mike placement and mixing leave a lot to be desired, but most of all, what bothers me is the matter-of-fact performance of these two symphonies, which are some of the most beautiful music that Dvorak has ever written. I was also bothered by some of the poor intonation on part of the cellos & bases (too sharp!!!), second clarinet (in soft sustained chords - sharp!!! - sticking out like a sore thumb, despite the poor recorded sound). All in all, not a very good performance, though the 8th fared somewhat better than the 9th, which is not saying much! Look for the Kertesz/LSO recording of these -- much more musical and expressive!"
2,Two versions,"After comparing my version with the samples here, and reading two reviews with different outcomes I checked track durations and found there are subtle differences. Maybe there are two versions. For example my version states: track 1: 9.53, 2: 11.05, 5: 11.44I find the recording lacking in recording quality (noticable hiss, very flat) as well as performance quality (again flat). Again this might be another version then presented here.Update:If you look closely at the picture shown, it shows: 'Wiener Philharmoniker', the titles for the samples however state: 'Vienna Philharmoniker'.So it's a mistake by Amazon. I think if you by this you will get the Wiener version (as I have), wich is subpar."
1,c-r-a-p,"First, I am one of the world's foremost fans and authorities on this band.Do NOT buy this--if you want information, choose any of a number of decent books. If a few SECONDS of unique video or photos are of value to you-then buy all you want.This is yet another of these ""critical review"" DVDs that are now so prevalent, like the dreaded UK Classic Rock series that feature people giving opinions and telling eighth-generation accounts. Though Chris Welch, Yardbird Chris Dreja etc are worthy folk indeed, the cobbled together video scenes and such are evidence of how little material there is about this group. The official LZ youtube channel is much better than this."
4,My not yet 3 year old loves it!,I was pleasantly surprise to find that it was educational. Especially the expressions for emotions and Ariel and the music notes. It covers a lot of different themes. It is more for girls though. I found that boys were really not interested in getting Cinderella ready for her wedding.
2,Cute,Cute... closest thing to a video game I'll let my 3-year-old use. I like that the sound is soft on this toy. Makes a good travel toy - better than sticking a DVD in their face during a long car ride.
3,medical terms,book was insightful. however medical terminology or words not normally used made it longer to read
2,Good for some maybe,"As a psychology student deeply interested in positive developmen I thought this book may assist me. I am in a family role which comstricts my true self. I think it was a well written book but in terms of development beyond the depressed rut I was in this book did nothing other than blame my parents, which may be the case however I was looking for pratical development of who i was mot just justifications."
2,Title Is a Bait and Switch,"I read this book for insights into my own nature and needs, and as one who seeks to understand giftedness better in general. I found good ideas in the book, but they were totally unrelated to the title.The title is simply a bait and switch. The ""gifted child"" turns out to be, *not* a gifted child, but any child, of any intelligence or talent level, who has survived parental neglect.Well, it's a valid topic (though see the other reviews). But I resent the hijacking of the word ""gifted."" High ability is not a Purple Heart to be pinned on the chest of a wounded person. I cannot see how this re-definition helps anyone; if anything, it may raise false self-image, which is precisely what the book wants to help overcome.Yes, she elsewhere acknowledges what she ""had in mind"" when re-defining ""gift."" But the title is seriously misleading.If you are looking for a self-help book relating to family-of-origin issues, this may help you."
2,I think there was a confusion.,"I requested a new book, but the book I received was used, it has marks and notes on it. I think they confused the book. But the price I paid was for a new book."
5,child abuse,"I tend towards looking deeply into whatever I'm involved in. The deeper the better - not necessarily comfortable or pleasant but getting down to the 'ugly' truth is paramount to me. Alice's books take me to the depths and the source of suffering in this world. Political unrest, religious persecution, corporate corruption, etc. I believe are sourced by child abuse. If reading Alice really pisses you off that might be a clue to the depth of the damage done to you.If you think you are not abused - others might be but not you or your family - I want to know what planet you came from.I use to believe that in the sea of compassion there were or might be islands of abuse and maltreatment - now I see that we live in a sea of abuse and there might be an island of compassion somewhere; I hope anyway.The books beginning with DRAMA OF THE GIFTED CHILD, after her 'awakening' are the best. Before then she was a full fledged psychotherapist and that is a pejorative."
5,Drama of the Gifted Child -- Great book,I really enjoyed this book. A must read. It was a good book providing insight to the long-term implications of child rearing. I was brought up with conservative parents and a surrounding establishment that condoned this type of behavior as a parent I have resisted doing the same to my kids and this book reminded me that I made the right decision.
4,Thought Provoking Read,"I found this book to be thought provoking yet difficult to read. Alice Miller writes about the causes and effects of childhood trauma using professional psychology jargon which makes it difficult for a lay person to easily understand some of what is written. Since I do not have a background in psychology, I will have to read it a second time to comprehend all the material.I found the book to be informative and it left me with the desire to read it again. I feel I will have to ""study"" the book rather than simply read the book. Do not be discouraged to read/study the book, it is worth the read."
2,"Ummmm, it's OK","This book must have been great in the 80s, but we've come a long way Alice Miller. She writes like someone who wants us all to know she's smart. This book is littered with psychiatric name drops and slightly esoteric references galore. It definitely gives information about narcissistic parenting but the info seems out of date and there are probably better books on the subject. Maybe, it's me and I just don't like the way this woman writes but I'd look for something else."
2,Why not just kill your mother?,"After hearing good things about the book I had hoped for some insight on how to change the approval seeking patterns developed from living in family where being good worked alot better than being authentic. Instead I got heavy handed criticism of ""mothers"" who warp their children through thier own selfish motivations. Some people may have parents who were intentionally cruel, but mine were just sad, depressed and inept. I spent so much effort defending them from this author's wrath, and perhaps anger at her own mother, that if there was any insight in this book about on how I might change my patterns of behavior I couldn't see it."
1,A treatise on victimhood,"The two pillars of this book are: 1) If you're gifted and depressed it's all your mother's fault, and 2) narcissism is a good thing. If ever a book encouraged whining victimhood and wallowing in depression this is it. One wonders if Miller would even have bothered writing this book (first published in 1979) if Prozac had been invented earlier. Reading her methods for ""overcoming"" one's past makes me thankful that Freud's psychoanalytic techniques have fallen into disfavor of late."
2,The Title is More Impressive than the Content,This book offers very little insight into the practical realities of defeating mental illness.
3,I Preferred To Have Saved My $$$,"I've many things to do on my day off, Sunday 03~08~09So I'll make my review short-n-sweet: The book honestly wasn't too much to brag about. It's written almost in textbook style which I loathe with a passion. I enjoy a more creative style of writing when relaxing at home after or before work.It wasn't what I expected overall, and decided to make some good use of it and donate it to the local library. So if your in the Hudson Valley area [in NY], simply request it sent to one of the libraries there. They will send it right over--this way you can save your cash.I don't recall the copyright of ""The Drama of the Gifted Child"", however it seems to me it was written sometimes in the ancient 60's area. {You know, that BORING style of writing!!! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK !!!!}"
4,A classic in serious need of revision,"Miller clearly states in her 1990 preface that her entire psychological orientation has radically changed since writing this book. Yet, she has opted to leave Drama in its original form. Considering the constrictions ""orthodox"" psychoanalytic theory place on thought, I would love to see the drama free of these colorings.Be that as it may, virtually every first-born baby boomer can profit from this book! Our fathers were largely absent. Our mothers were forced into social straightjackets that stunted their humanity. The false selves this environment produced has left a legacy of emotional pain that continues to fuel the therapy industry. As Miller contends, our only hope lies in ""the emotional discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood.""This book calls us to this historical, and personal, task."
5,Critically important,"I cannot stress enough how important this book is if one is at all interested in truly understanding the genesis and repair of childhood emotional damage, in many forms.With stunning insight Alice Miller has helped me personally understand more about my own inner dynamics than I could have ever understood had I not found her work. Read it - it will change your life."
5,Serious stuff,"About 15 years ago I picked up this book, expecting to gain insight about one of my high school students. Distressingly, I found it was really about me, and I cried most of the way through it. But I couldn't put it down and I am so thankful I discovered it by whatever means. This book was an essential element in a period of self-awareness and self-realization for me. I count it among the top three books that have had the biggest impact on my relationship with myself and others. It is most definitely not light reading, though. It's possible that people who can't relate to it personally or vicariously through a loved one won't have such a strong reaction, but be forewarned--I didn't think it had anything to do with me, either."
1,Terrible,"This product doesn't work like it days, the colors are hard to mix and the result is [...]."
4,"Standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop.","This ""old school"" rap classic was L.L. Cool J's first Top Ten pop hit. There are three mixes of that song here, plus one bonus song. Here is the track listing:1. Around the Way Girl (LP Version)2. Around the Way Girl (Untouchables Remix)3. Around the Way Girl (Instrumental)4. Murdergram - Live (LP Version)"
4,The road leads to love.,"When a beloved rogue of an Uncle passes away an estranged couple heading towards divorce, and the worst mistake of their lives, must make an extended road trip to carry out his final request. Everything that can go wrong does. And everything that can go right does as well. Lynda Simmons has a gift for bringing even the most sidelined of characters to three dimensional life, which makes her story all the richer. The love between the main characters is bittersweet and, for it to once again become strong, both must learn to except and embrace what they think makes each so different from the other. Highly recommended."
3,Fashion Fever Barbie Chair plus ...,This whole line of Barbie fashion furniture and decor is really cool. The colors are great and everything is funky and modern. But I bought this set for my daughter at a well known toy store for $5.00. Why the insanely high prices here?
2,Careful Subaru Owners,Although this thermostat is a option for the Subaru Outback it is a lot smaller than the OEM thermostat. I installed this Motorad thermostat in my 2001 Subaru Outback and it caused my car temp to rise to the 3/4 mark way to hot and I feared it would make my car overheat. Changed it out with a Stant thermostat and my engine temp was back to normal.Also want to say that Amazon customer service was Great!!! They resolved this problem putting the customer first as they always do. Great job Amazon!!!
2,Not what I expected,"First of all, you can't hook up a flash drive as was advertised. Second of all, I was hoping for digital tuning, which it doesn't have. Also, the little display it has only gives you the number of the song you are on, not the time in the song.My alarm clock radio sounds better than this one. I would recommend spending a little more money and getting a better one. The only thing I really like about it is that it is very small. It is perfect if you need a travel size CD player."
4,Easy to Use,Simple and basic. I got it for my mom who didn't want anything fancy just something she could easily use and this fit the bill. Not too heavy
3,Product is okay,"I really wanted something like this for work. Inexpensive and small. Have to admit, after one week of average use, the lid broke. Guess you get what you pay for.Also- cd player does not allow you to search (skip/rewind) while in the midst of a song.So if you are looking for a ""simple"" CD /RADIO PLAYER.... THIS IS IT."
4,Clear sound,"Sound is clear, plays cds well. Only problem it does not have a display for radio stations.This why it only gets four stars. Overall reccommend this product."
1,Does not play MP3 burned CD's!!!!!,Amazon needs to change the description. I should have read the reviews before purchasing this product. I read the description assuming it will play MP3s burned on a CD. IT DOES NOT!!! I think it's about time Amazon changed the description on this so people can stop buying this product by mistake.
2,DO NOT BUY - A PIECE OF CRAP!,"Cons: poorly built, un-reliable, VERY LIMITED WARRENTY, CD lasts LESS THAN 6mths, DEFECTIVE CD playerI purchased a CX-CD236 on April 11, 2010 and by October 3, 2010 (8 days before the 6 month mark) the CD player on the radio stopped working. My husband and I was only using the CD player on the radio to play our toddlers' lullaby CD during the night while she slept AND THAT WAS IT! I called Tech support to only be told that I had exceeded the 90 day warrenty for this particular radio and that there was nothing they could do for me. CAN YOU SAY MAD AS HECK!!! I would not advise anyone to purchase this radio - the CD player only has a shelf life of about 6 months."
3,Great for MP3s - use a flash drive or hard drive too,I had two of these so I am selling one on Amazon. The cool thing with this is that you can hook up a flash drive to quickly listen to music. With 1Gb flash drives for $10 and 2Gb ones for $16 this is a great feature. Makes it easy and cheaper than CDs or CDRs.I even hooked it up to my hard drive that has my iTunes library on it and it started playing tracks from that. I think that would keep it playing for days.The sound is not the best but it is also small and cheap so I understand.
1,the worst i have ever bought from amazon,broken when recieved it-led didnt work so you cant see the channel your on-it turns on but thats about all
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this radio/CD player about three months ago. It's barely been used and already the CD player has given out. At least the radio still works - but oh, I forgot - you can't easily tune to a station you like because this player has no radio dial.If you have the cash to throw away on vague pieces of trash then by all means, buy yourself a dozen of these. As for me, I am ""going greener"" and throwing mine into the recycle bin.I do not at all suggest even contemplating the purchase of this item."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,DOES *NOT* PLAY CD'S WITH MP3 FILES...which is the only reason I purchased it. Don't know if it's a decent little radio or not. But I *do* know it does not match its description!
2,not a mp3 player,"I purchased this item because Amazon's description claims it can play mp3 on CDs. It does not do this. It is a good, inexpensive CD player, but not for mp3s."
1,Piece of junk,"Cd player would not turn on. Upon close inspection, the switch is not aligned properly so that it cannot be moved all the way to the left to turn on the CD player. So what you end up with is ""off"" and ""radio"". Is there any quality control anymore? More cheap Chinese crap. Avoid it."
2,Poor,"Thought I was ordring better model. Returned to Amazon. Sond was tinny. Like the 248 much, much better.Would not reccomend"
1,What the heck was I thinking?,"This cd is horrible! I thought I heard one of his songs that I liked, but after hearing it, I knew I was wrong. The whole cd is garbage. Don't waste your money."
3,pretty good set,I like His sense of groove&Hook. Hit&Miss with the Vocals&the Kind of Artist you could get into more either Live or doing Production on other Artists.but this set has some nice grooves that you can Bop your head to.
3,I WAS AMPPED OFF HIS VIDEO...,"I saw this brotha on VH1 Soul and his video of ""Dreamin'"" and he had my dyin' laughin' because he's a big ass ham! I like that cut so much and his steelo (Reminded me of Prince, which he used to tour with) that I decided to scoop his CD. Not bad. Not great. But not bad. ""Dreamin'"" is the standout track and almost worth the purchase itself since Saadiq penned it. Other nice tracks are ""i believe in you"", ""eye to eye"", and the Sly Stone-esque ""if you can't get me off you mind."" If you want something different and eclectic, this is a good twist."
4,Not as bad as the rating suggest...,"Ok these reviews are getting a little out of hand. I own both this recording and the Grumiaux/Davis/LSO recording. While the Grumiaux IS more enjoyable, I don't see much wrong with the Perlman. Perlman's take on these concertos is quite different from Grumiaux's; while Grumiaux goes for more of a detached aloofness, Perlman tries more romantic of an approach. I know, I know, Mozart isn't meant to be played romantic, but to these ears this interpretation is rather fresh. If you are going to choose one set, buy the Grumiaux. If you want an alternative interpretation, though, give this a try."
4,"relatively fine, but...","Here, Perlman's romanticized style can be heard as always, and Levine comes sort of loose; it is difficult for me to listen to this disc often. As other reviewers suggest, Grumiaux is probably the best one. (and it is a bargain also) His Mozart is tight, well formed and sophisticated. Grumiaux's Mozart is a joy to listen to over and over."
1,stay away from it.....,"I agree totally with other reviewers, Perlman spends his time in virtuosity, but the issue is more with the orchestra where Levin's direction is totally neutral, lifeless and even boring in some moments... Definitely try the Grumiaux version, Oitrakh or Heifetz. Personnaly i like the power and fantastic sound deployed by Oitrakh's violin in all his records, certainly the most impressive: this man had an incredible force in his arm to play so nicely and he is unique. Heifetz is different and in the fourth and fifth concerto, so emotional that you listen the records everyday with the same admiration and emotion. Then you realize why Mozart was unique, and also why he deserves that artists make the effort at least to be lively like his music was and not monotone. Mozart violin concertos are uncomparable, and stay away from this record."
5,It was a gift,I have no idea how good this was. I bought it based on the reputation of the artists. I gave it as a gift. Nonetheless someone thinks I should review it.
2,Romanitic Mozart?,"Perlman spends his time on virtuosity, and not enough time on style. Keep in mind that Mozart composed in the Classical period."
5,lots more twists,"Kept the ""New world"" concept fresh by taking us to New exciting locations. Hot romance with reluctant lovers, enjoyed the ""tug of war"" going on between the lovers. Adore the dust bunnies, I need More."
5,Great dating book,"I loved this book. It was so real. And I sobbed at the end. Good, light reading, but meaningful. I totally recommend it."
5,Great Mindless Reading,"Great quick read. With all the waiting time in Airports now, I read it on a trip to Boston last weekend. a Fast read, a funny read with mostly believable characters in situations that are all too real. Tries to do a bit too much with the ""tidy, happy"" ending ... but I enjoyed it."
3,predictable and boring,This book was sooooo boring! The dating was supposed to be the important part of the book so why was it surrounded with way too much fluff about her job and Natasha? The book should have been 75 pages. The ending was just a little TOO predictable. Read Mr. Maybe or Jemima J instead of this one!
5,"Girlfriends, career, drinking, men, smoking, Girlfriends...","This was the best ""Single girl looking for love and success"" book I have read so far. I love the genre, but this is by far the best. The ending was excellent!To add to this read, I recently watched the made for tv ABC family movie based on this book. Stayed very true to the book and the lead actress, Charisma Carpenter fit very well in the role of Jane as did the actor who played Ethan. Nice Sunday afternoon snuggle up movie."
4,Finding her way in love and life...,"we watch as Jane struggles and succeeds. A fun journey with charming characters. We follow Jane as over the course of three months she falters and despairs and recovers beautifully in the pitfalls and passion of the elusive success in love and life. In any of her struggles one can easily relate. As she traipses around New York we easily fall in love with her ""home town."" Submerged in the pages of this book I became one of the characters and fell in love with each one that I met. A Great Book! Easy reading! Humor on every page!"
2,Mediocre,"I have not finished reading it but I am already disappointed. The actual writing lacks any sort of complexity and could be something I read in middle school, maybe earlier. The character also seems juvenile. She is supposed to be a little self conscious which I understand, but I feel like I am being told the story by person with a high school student's mentality. I suppose the poor writing contributes to that."
4,Interesting if she actually dated,"This book should have been called ""See Jane try to get a life, exagerate her life and find true love at the end"".Don't get me wrong, I like ""See Jane Date"", it just is interesting that Senate spent a lot of time deconstructing Jane's life than actually allowing her to have one.""See Jane Date"" is your formulaic chick-lit book. You will find no suprises and no real guesses work to what is going to happen. The reason I am giving this four stars is because Senate, like Jennifer Weiner, seems to have a firm grasp of writing a coherent sentance, just too bad she couldn't come up with a more original plot.Senate is a decent writer, and this books is a nice fun read, it just is not original nor does the main character really striker a chord within you. The publisher, Red Dress Ink, has put up a few chapters of her next book on their website and that should be interesting on how it turns out."
1,"whiny, pity party of one","The character of Jane had some sort of personality disorder. The way she resented people (her aunt, her boss, etc.) for caring about her....She was defective. I'm not quite sure if we're supposed to root for her. She clearly has some issues that she thinks can be solved by finding the right man. Not a healthy lesson for women!"
1,Totally predictable,"The book was a disappointment. The story was predictable, the situations which were designed to provide laughter/humor were forced and trite, and frankly, after the first several chapters or so, I was ready to give up on the book altogether (eerily similar to certain scenes/characters in Bridget Jones' Diary and The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing). It has its funny moments, but don't waste your money, go read the two books mentioned above, or ""Me Times Three"" / ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" instead if you're into this genre."
3,goal in life -- a date?,"Although I enjoyed this novel a lot, I had some trouble understanding why Jane was always fretting over dates. She was an interesting, well-rounded character as far as chick lit goes, and the story had a lot of depth that kept me interested. But Jane definitely had a self-confidence problem, and I got sick of hearing her want a date. Enjoy life! A boyfriend isn't the gold at the end of the rainbow."
4,See me laugh and wince...,"'See Jane Date' is one among many 'chick lit' efforts, however, I find it one of the better written books. The characters are well developed, and I 'felt' for Jane, as well as her friends. Jane is a 28 year old single woman in NYC, struggling financially as well as emotionally. She still hangs onto old high school insecurity and grudges, and has to suffer through her seemingly perfect cousin's 'perfect' wedding to the 'perfect' man. I think more than a few women could relate to Jane's less than perfect life, as well as less than perfect dating record! 'See Jane Date' is definitely worth reading."
4,I was hooked,"I really enjoyed this one, it was fun...smooth and very relatable! Definetely a great summer read!"
4,Very good entry into the genre,This is the first book in the Red Dress series. This romantic comedy type book has a nice easy flow to it that I thoroughly enjoyed. I enjoyed the main character immensely and could actually live with her through her various disastrous dates. Very well done.
1,Mucho [bad],"...this seems completely vapid to me. I borrowed it from a friend...She didn't like it; neither did I...bad writing, thin plot, overall very mediocre..."
1,Pucky,"drivel... I hate the main character she is pathetic, and selfish, whiney and generally unlikeable. I could not even finish the book for fear that in the ending would be happy for the twit"
3,"A quick, light read!","I must be honest, I read the reviews on amazon before buying the book and as you can see it is a mixed reaction. I will defend the naysayers and agree that yes, it is a Bridget Jones' knockoff and it is a bit predictable, however that does not mean that I did not enjoy it. I was looking for a light read, one in which I did not need to think about. I read it in less than a week (mainly before bed) & I found it interesting enough to finish, yet not intriguing enough to not put down. I recommend it if you are looking for a something light to read."
4,Not a pulitzer but entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book... I would not disagree with the other reviewer that it is a little predictable.. I liked how the characters seemed as neurotic as my friends and I can be sometimes.. I found the book pretty realistic... and fair to the challenges we face in late 20's career, love, family, bridesmaids dresses etc... The main character deals with all these things and some demons left from high school...If you are a fan of Sex and The City or have loved Bridget Jones' Diary, then this book would be right up your alley.If you are looking for a quick read about life in your late 20's as a single ""career girl"", pick it up. I don't think you will be disappointed."
3,"Bad Jane. Bad, bad, Jane.","I'm beginning to think the entiregeneration of twenty-somethingfemales is neurotic. And no wonder,if all they read arebooks like this.Jane worriesabout everything,every thingshe does, every wordout of her mouth.Bad Jane. Bad, bad Jane.Lighten up, Jane, lighten up."
1,Not very good,"Interesting idea, but poor execution. The main character, ""Jane"" would be much more interesting and the book more enjoyable, if the writer had tried harder to make her come alive. Instead, ""Jane"" (both the character and the book) is kind of flat. The writer seems to have cut corners, which isn't the way to tell a compelling story. Readers don't despair! There are other ""Red Dress"" books that are ten times better."
4,See Jane Date,"Whomever coined the phrase ""curl up with a good book"" had something like Melissa Senate's See Jane Run in mind. Light, breezy, and underlined with heart, it's easy to get caught up in Jane Gregg's search for the right man in a city full of Mr. Wrongs. The numerous pop culture references add to the me too fun, how many women haven't fallen prey to the dream of the DKNY wardrobe? Though perhaps the greatest moments of the reality in the novel come when Jane stamps surface labels on everyone she meets only to be left stunned that she had them perfectly upside down, we've all been guilty of a Gnatasha from time to time. See Jane Date is a relatable journey with some laughs and tears along the way."
5,Melissa Senate Rocks!,"See Jane Date is witty, poignant, and timely - just what the twenty and thirty-something woman needs to get through her day! Reading this charming, wry, totally laugh-out-loud new novel, I knew the author would be someone I'd be pleased to call a friend. She really connects with the average urban chick - I could tell as much from a line on the very first page. ""Like I didn't own a miracle bra in every color..."" Ha! It's nice to know there are others out there with a fine appreciation of the ironies of the liberated woman. I look forward to the next Melissa Senate venture!"
3,Mediocre,"I have not finished reading it but I am already disappointed. The actual writing lacks any sort of complexity and could be something I read in middle school, maybe earlier. The character also seems juvenile. She is supposed to be a little self conscious which I understand. However, I feel like I am being told the story by person with a high school student's mentality. I suppose the writing itself contributes to that."
2,Give it a miss,"This young-woman-on-the-verge-of-success-and-happiness genre is quite popular now, and I've read a lot of them. This is a resoundingly average example, featuring characters that lack definition and vibrancy, a standard plot with few insights and no surprises, and the death knell -- no humor about its navel-gazing subjects. I didn't even bother passing this one on to friends, but left it on the magazine rack at the gym."
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could,"This is a cheap, badly-written book. It has all the depth of a comic book, the writing is just as simplistic and the plot is oh-so-run of the mill. I give it a zero for writing, zero for creativity, zero for dialogue, zero for plot. Enough said. Yawn."
2,Shallow,"I wanted to like this Bridget Jones clone. The character, Jane, was just too annoying- no wonder she couldn't find a boyfriend. I give this two stars, because I did read it all, towrds the end I WAS skimming.All Jane does is whine about her job- hmm she has an entry level position...don't many 20 somethings, her small apartment - it's NYC get over yourself. Her wardrobe from Ann Taylor and Banana Republic- not exactly low end shops! She is downright nasty to/about her family and coworkers. She has a real sense of entitlement. I found it revolting that she only quit smoking for some guy not even for herself.The ending was obvious, I think a book about the other characters might have been better. I also need to add that the scene where she compares herself in Bloomingdales to Holly Golightly at Tiffany's was nearly offensive! How did the editor allow shallow nasty Jane to be likened to the spirited Holly?!?Skip it....."
1,It's a Parody of Itself!,This was an excruciating read. I bought the book thinking it would be funny and warm but it's just bad literature. What I found to be especially interesting is the fact that Jane is an editor and she criticizes Natasha's bad writing. It made me feel for the person who had to edit this book. The fact that there's a bad book within this bad book was the only funny part. I recommend this book for all you cheese lovers who enjoy a little whine.
3,A decent light read,"For the light romantic comedy that it is supposed to be, it was decently entertaining. Most of the entertainment came from Jane going on her dates and dealing with the wedding hoopla. Her obssession with Natasha was downright annoying. And her realization that Natasha was human wasn't as mind-boggling as the author probably intended it to be. In fact, all of Jane's realizations about life were very out-of-the-blue and very superficial. But then again, these books are not to be read for life-altering revelations but for pure fun, or in this case, a decent amount of fun."
3,"Good...but not as good as ""Milkrun""","Jane Gregg is a single woman in NYC. Her mission: To find a date to her cousin's wedding in 2 months. Her obstacle: Is there a half way decent guy in this city?! In desperate need of a man, Jane goes on several 'blind dates' which in themselves, are funny. Also, she must edit the autobiography of an former highschool classmate, whom she never liked.Though ""See Jane Date"" is funny at times, I found it to be very predictable, especially towards what happens at the very end. A good light book for every women who has ever been single!Also try ""Milkrun"" by Sarah Mlynowsii."
2,Hey Melissa Senate - Get a Map!,I don't think the author has ever been to the Upper East Side of New York - 818 East 81st Street? No such place. Is she serious? Was this a typo? The bit about the talking through the cabinets was entertaining but the rest was pretty weak. People that aren't from New York City might like this book but as someone that lives here it was stupid.
1,Yuck! What a whiny &&%$*!!!!,"Dear lord, this is one of the most tedious books I have read in ages. I generally love the Chick Lit genre, but this book is just annoying. I find the writing boring and tedious and often quite juvenile. The character is completely self-absorbed and a whiny... Blech, it's really quite awful."
1,Let's Try This Again,"(...) SEE JANE DATE is a horrible book. Recycled plot, bad writing, predictable ending, the works. As another reviewer put it: ""Save your money for something better."""
1,Avid Reader,"Frankly, it insulted my intelligence. It was not funny, not witty, not even slightly amusing. I couldn't even finish it."
2,A Literary Review,"I found the Melissa Senate's novel See Jane Date to be void of any literary greatness. The diction of the novel is informal and colloquial, which makes reading the book seem like listening to a story from a close friend. It was a highly amusing and easy book to read. The author uses allusions to famous Hollywood actors help set the idea of Jane being a real person, who admires the same celebrities we do. Jeremy Black, Jane's handsome boss, symbolizes her attachment to unlikely dreams. An example of foreshadowing in the novel is Jane's family insisting she go to the wedding with their charming neighbor; Jane persistently refused to go out with him, but when she finally meets him at the end, they fall in love. Over all, the message of the book was that looking for love will get you nowhere, and you will find love when you stop looking for it."
5,Gr8 book+,"This book is a blessing to anyone seeking to improve their, or loved ones diet. It gives so many ideas. Thanks for the help.+"
1,"After Chemo, Some Folks Will Eat Anything!","I'm sorry to disagree with so many ""true believers"", but I too am a cancer survivor and I truly believe it is the fear of relapse rather than the taste of Mr.Milken's concoctions that influenced so many of these rave reviews. I tried the soy ""smoothies"" and found they tasted better on the way out. After trying his Devil's ""Fool"" Cake, I felt like a fool shelling out all this money! Life is too short- I know- so eat REAL food! If you buy this book, consider it nothing more than a donation to Milken's worthy Cancer research organization. Spare yourself the culinary agony of sampling these ""dishes"". When I licked cancer, I treated myself to a juicy rib-eye. Of course, I watch what I eat and mind my cholesterol. But I must have pleasure too. Cancer was painful enough!"
2,If only I'd read the customer reviews more thoroughly. . .,"I bought what turned out to be a beautifully photographed, almost coffee table-like book . . . but not only do I have a hard enough time finding exotic ingredients where I live but I surely don't have the time to do the recipes Mr. Milken's personal chef turns out every night. If only I'd read a little further in my frenzy to find out everything I could about prostate cancer! My husband is newly diagnosed with the disease and we're attempting to turn our diets in a more healthy direction but it still has to be realistic cooking or it just won't happen at the end of a long work day. The best cookbook I've found out there is ""Eat to Beat PC Cookbook"" by David Ricketts. I need a cookbook I can really use for us to make this battle."
5,Unbelievable banana cream pie and brownies!,"So far, I've only tried the desserts, but they are amazing. I never knew cooking with soy could taste this good!"
4,Good Stuff,"The book presents recipes attractively. I've tried a few and they were easier and better than I expected, given the somewhat unusual ingredients for familiar foods. The book goes astray, to some degree, in my opinion, because it works too hard at recreating unhealthy high fat foods with low-fat, high-soy, equivalents. Better to just present vegetarian recipees that don't try to seem like something else."
3,If I Were A Rich Man...,"The taste For Living Cookbook Mike Milken's Favorite Recipes For Fighting Cancer is a nicely photographed book. The recipes are basic health food fare. Cut down on fat,avoid meat, eat lots of veggies and soy. If I was a wealthy man I would have a professional chef move into my home and cook these complicated meals im my professional kitchen. I would also go to a medition center in Massachusetts ""based on Ayurveda tradition"" and I would ""invite a doctor trained in both Western and Ayurveda medicine to move into...our house for a few months"" I don't mean to be cynical but I have neither the time or money to follow this books recipes. I did not find this book very helpful ."
2,NO COLOR!,"I normally like textbooks, but this one has no color inside. The boxes of text that are usually blue or purple? They're gray! I showed the book to my daughter and asked her if she noticed anything unusual. She immediately pointed out that the book was missing color. This lack of color makes the book seem uninteresting and difficult to read. I never knew how much of a difference a little bit of color could make, until I got this book."
2,NOT ACCEPTABLE,"The description of the book was acceptable condiition,legible, may contain marking, cover wear, loose/torn pages and much writing. What they gave me was book with a ripped off hard cover. The description does not match the book it self. The pages are fine almost like new, and the only markings on the book are of moderate amount of highlighted areas. But I was very alarmed when I first open my book to see all of the inside fall off the cover. I'm want to question if they actually physically review the books they send out?!"
3,"Not outstanding, but with some appealing sights...","SPECIFICS:Page Count: 48Number of images: 34Small images: 0Half page images: 2Full page images: 292-page spreads: 3BW images: 0TEXT:1 page foreword1 page biography2 page index with the title and year for each pieceART:5 images: 5 stars19 images: 4 stars10 images: 3 stars0 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 Stars"
2,Not to my taste...,"It is clear the artist has great technics, yet some of most of the work in the book is quite kitsch and not elegant. I guess the fans of first degree sexy will love this style. Amazing cover (I wish more of it was like that)"
2,Not the best of its kind,"I had high hopes for this guide, as I generally respect the reviews of A.O. Scott and the New York Times movie review crew. However, this book disappoints in several ways:1) The movies are heavily skewed towards those released in the last 10 years. The more recent a movie, the less likely I am to have ""almost forgotten"" it. Sure, Metropolis is in here, but very few other movies until the 1990s. What I'm looking for in a book of this title is more older movies that I am more likely to never have heard fo.2) Some of the recommended movies are pretty questionable, in my book. I understand there is bound to be difference of opinion, but I doubt that flicks like ""Drumline"", and ""Freddy got Fingered"", rank amoung the best movies I've never seen."
4,Great Gift Book,"Tired of wandering the aisles of the video store, only to succumb to yet another film made for teenage boys? Then pick up this new guide, which boasts 500 wide-ranging reviews of everything from art films, small-scale indies and foreign-language films, to coming-of-age comedies and thrillers that ""flourish on the far side of respectability.""The one-page reviews, all organized alphabetically, are sure to enthuse even the staunchest cinephile - but especially fans of ""The New York Times."" You won't agree with everything, to be sure. But there's definitely something for everyone here. A great gift book for a cinephile."
5,KC Hilites,Great Lites they even look better with the Amber Covers. Put a pair on my 1935 Auburn Boatail Speedster Look Great
5,contenido libro,"es un libro muy didáctico, con un contenido secuencial apropiado y con la información requerida por todo profesional para racionalizar sus procedimientos operatorios. lo considero excelente; por esa razón es el libro de texto guia en los seminarios de biomateriales y operatoria en los programas de posgrado de la facultad de odontología de la Universidad de Antioquia"
2,"A decent read, but a bit monochromatic","A typical L'Amour book - a dashing, trustworthy protagonist, just trying to live in peace but able to defend himself if and when necessary. Jubal Sackett is loved and trusted by all except the villains, who themselves have absolutely no redeeming qualities at all. In other words, the characters are very flat and monochromatic, and as a result, they come across as very artificial.One thing you have to hand to L'Amour, though - he writes book easily read in an evening."

3,"A huge book, with not a lot of meat","The Using Front Page 2000 comes with some free software, which they make a big deal about, and it is only shareware or trial programs, nothing you cannot easily find online.The book is huge and heavy, and did not address several of the advanced areas I was looking for, and I thought there was a lot of writing and not a lot of meat. Too much verbose talk and not enough examples.Also after reviewing the book, I have sent it back, and I have decided to move away from Front Page, and move to Dreamweaver. I have tried their trial program, and the program can do so much more, and is not dependant on MS extentions.Overall I was not happy with the book, I have seen a much better presentation of information, easier to read, formatting, etc.There was some good information in the book, but I think I just am more disillusioned with Front Page overall as it has become limiting to what I want to do with design."
5,the best,"this cd is the best, better than their album comalies. its depressing i know but its worth it"
2,For fans only,Not much hit material here even if you get the extended version withthe halflife ep included. Check it out if you can get it cheap andare a completist
2,There is far better,"I bought this CD because so many seemed to think it was good. What a disappointment. This CD is non-stop vocals, which really gets annoying. There are no standout songs. There are good guitar riffs and background music, but it gets buried. Your money is better spent on Theator of Tragedy, Avrigus, and Darkwell.."
1,very very disappointing,"i heard of lacuna coil through the grapevine, and came here to read the reviews from other listeners. most seemed to rave about the album, so i picked it up. man oh man, i wish now i never listened to you knuckleheads. this album is nothing like i expected, and it's very bad. the songs are slow, boring, and unexperimental. they all sound the same. they have no heavy side to them. (at least type o negative has some heavy aspects.) i literally had to take the cd out before it even finished, i couldn't bear to listen to the rest. very poor indeed."
4,Loved It,"It's not as good as the future Comalies but it does have its good sound to it, bought it today and just like comalies i can't get enough of it, i think the only big difference between the album and comalies, is that the choruses in the songs are not as strong, their good but just don't have that punch sometimes, i like this band a little more then Evanescence, because not only is this band older, but the music has a lot more rock."
5,Excellent,"I believe this CD is very worthy of 5 stars for many reasons. Mostly because of the heavy, yet melodic music fronted by beautiful female vocals. Although I am usually turned off by female vocals, Christina shines on this album. One thing many might not agree with is the accompanying male vocals. Some say they are too dirty and gruff to compliment the beauty of the rest of the music and vocals, but I believe they bring more emotion into the music. Christina does have a wonderful voice, but I don't believe she could display male emotion as well male vocals could. Overall a wonderful release, get it today."
4,Great earbuds for blocking outside noise,"These earbuds with their different sizes of ear pieces make it so they fit well in my ears. They seal very nicely so that airplane noise is mostly eliminated. In fact, I can't hear the flight attendant without taking one out. The sound quality on these are very good - the bass is much better than previous earbuds I've had that used foam for outside the ear canal.One of the buds has a longer wire which at first I didn't think I would like. But with when it's around the back of your neck it keeps it from dangling if you have to momentarily take it out. Also it makes the main wire stay off to the side so it doesn't get hung up on things as easily as if it were front and center. I'm sure ther are more expensive models with better sound but I think these are a good value for the price."
2,Give me a headache,"There are 3 different sized rubber ear pieces, but even with the smallest one it feels like its pushing the inside of my ear open. And after a few minutes it gives me a headache. If I use a larger size they don't stay in. Maybe its just my ears, but I think I have pretty normal ears. I guess i got what i paid for. I recommend spending a bit more."
2,Won't buy these again,"I do not care for these headphones. Here's why -When I opened the package I noticed there was a cord extension in there. I thought ""now I'll have a nice long cord if I need one."" Guess what? I needed it. I like to carry my radio in my pocket. The regular wire on the headphone did not even reach my coat pocket and I'm not even 5'2""! I have to use the extension and fold part of it up.If you move around (like walking) the buds (I only got 2 sets, not 3) slip right out of your ears. Maybe my ears are too small? It's annoying. The buds stay in if I sit on the bus not moving around.The reason I gave 2 stars and not 1 is because once the buds are not falling out, the sound is pretty decent. If I hadn't had these sitting around for a few months before I tried them, I would've returned them."
5,great bargain,This excellent version of these two impressionist masterpieces is one of the best bargains you can find. The Emersons do a great job with these pieces and the sonics are superb.
5,Vast anthology of Toasts,"1 of the 3 books devoted exclusively to Toasts, this book contains the biggest anthology of Toasts of the the 3. Quite an enjoyable read, too bad it's out of print - the record that came with this book is now on CD on the Rounder label (same title as the book)."
3,Spooky fun!,"This book brings back my childhood. It is a fun, short, simple and colorful read. The pages have cut-outs in the shape of ghosts that turn out to be real world objects like laundry, kittens, and even smog from a factory. Basic reading with bold and colorful graphics that should appeal to any child."
3,Is there anything like this for a septum piercing?,"Note: The rating is based off what it was needed it for. We do not know how this product works in an ear.We need something to hide a septum piercing, but nothing other than the usual staples or posts was able to be found. This sort of works in the nose okay, but is still fairly visible. Pops in and out super easy so it was lost in a tissue. Work requirements demand something like this rather than a standard septum retainer, and until something better is made this does good enough for now."
1,Terrible,"The Magic Pony was one of my favorite videos when I was younger, and I remember renting it countless times. However, I was extremely disappointed re-watching this movie as an adult. It's incredibly tedious and hard to get through, especially since the plot is weak and repetitious and the animation is so poor. Still, young children may find something to like in it."

3,"A Good Writer, Missing One Ingredient","Greg Kramer writes very well. He plots very well. But I was put off by his lack of empathy -- seemingly at times of interest, even -- in any of the otherwise vivid characters that he has created here. Adelaide is a brilliant creation, but I felt the author was keeping her at a distance, not allowing her to come fully to life. Or .. is this how PoMo fiction is supposed to be?"
5,Tavist Allergy Purchase,"I have absolutely no complaints aboiut this purchase. The product was received promptly, as expected."
3,Too Romantic?,"Karajan's a great conductor, to be sure, but this rendition of Haydn's Paris symphonies leaves me unsatisfied. The tempos on some of the minuets are *way* too slow. Of course, I cut my symphonic-Haydn teeth on the Marriner/ASMF performances available on Philips DUO, which I recommend. It also sounds as if the Berlin Philharmonic might be a bit too big for these works, or maybe it's just the sonics of this 1981 recording. In any event, I find this interpretation much too Romantic for Joseph Haydn, the epitome of Classicism.Karajan's and the BPO's performance of the Adagio of No. 87 is not bad, though."
4,This is a great product,"This is a great product and give the users flexibility to have their laptop or CRT in a comfortable position. I just think it is a little bit pricey. I thik 30% less price would be great for this product. I gave 4 Stars because of high price, otherwise as far as comfort is concern it deserves 5 Stars."
1,BAD ITEM,"Horrible item, I would recommend that you do not buy this. The swivel adjuster won't tighten enough to prevent the laptop from falling towards you."
1,hate it,"this thing needs better support, especially on the two bottom aluminum arms. they should wrap around another 90 degrees so as to secure the laptop from falling off the tray. depending on the angle you adjust the notebook at, your laptop can fall off this stupid ill-thought-out device and break. thanks for the stupidity, ergotron."
3,notebook tray needs additional hardware,The quaility of the unit was good but it seems that some sort of strap should be provided to assist when a laptop is opened wide and it has the potential to fall off the mount. I would recommend purchasing an adjustable strap if you use your unit as a monitor.
5,PRETTY NIGHT LIGHT BULB,"These work perfectly in a night light I have. They are a little deeper blue & not only prettier than the blue ones you can buy in the store, but much cheaper. The color is somewhat aqua-blue or turquoise."
2,Positively has mistakes,"I agree with the other reviewer here, the one named Scott. Some other examples of the book's wrong information are:1) Claiming David Cassidy was 16 playing Keith on The Partridge Family. Cassidy was in fact born in 1950. He first played Keith in 1969 or 1970.2)Claiming Roddy McDowall reprised his film role of Galen in the tv series version of Planet of The Apes. Wrong! In the theatrical films he played Cornelius and Caesar, not Galen.And I would add Grieg has definitly not seen every episode of every tv show he wrote about in his book."
3,Far too middle of the road - but Abbado would get better,"Abbado's eqrly cycle of the Beethoven symphonies with the Vienna Phil. did little to enhance his reputation and much to affirm that he could be bland and uninspired. But he had a tremendous capacity for personal growth as a musician, and in recent years his live readings of Beethoven with the Berlin Phil. have drawn awed responses. This stody Sixth and Eighth are best forgotten. They come in so-so sound, the orchestra is by no means energized, and Abbado himself has no ideas to communicate. I can't quite understand why the reviewer below who calls this CD a stroll in the countryside thinks that he's bestowing praise."
1,Not right for kids,"I purchased this book after taking a course in signing for my twins. I was looking for a short book with basic signs that we could use everyday. The publisher seems to have missed the mark on what signs kid would want or need in a simple signing book. For example the section titled ""Snacks and Food"" has 42 signs, but doesn't have the word vegetable, or any sign for any vegetable. Instead, what they do have is a section of 30 signs on religion, including such everyday usage words for children as ""resurrection"", ""missionary"", and ""devil"". A number of words in this category are helpful including ""God"", ""church"", and ""prayer"", but for the most part the book has a lot of words that adults think children should learn and not nearly enough words that children would use everyday. My suggestion would be to buy a real dictionary from a different publisher that has all the words you will be looking up."
3,"Great format and ideas, but some signs are old or not used.","While I enjoyed the book's format and ideas, I found that a number of the signs were second choices in reliable sign language sources. I also found that some of the signs were not even used or mentioned in those same reliable sources. It needs to be updated and compared with texts from Gaulludet and other recognized institutions."
5,EXCELLENT FOR PARENTS WHO'D LIKE TO TEACH A CHILD,I have a 3 year old with speech delays and he is beginning touse signing as a means of communication. This book gives excellentpictures and descriptions for an adult who needs to learn simple everyday words and gestures through sign language. I know my child will benefit through my purchase of this book.
4,awesome educational sign language book,I bought this book for my 8 year old.....she loves the way the book is broken into categories and easy to read while looking at the pictures. Great find!!!!
2,Signing for Kids,"It is similiar to Signing Illustrated.. It does not have practice sentences. Also some signs are not ""correct""."
4,good book for kids,"Purchased this book for my child's class. Good, clear pictures of signs. Better than some other books I've bought."
4,A Book for all health care Professionals,"I found the book to be very readable and informative. It took the mystery out of long term care insurance, by explaining in detail who would benefit from it and process of applying for the insurance. I also liked the book because it was written from the conumer's perspective. It can serve as an invaluable resource for all health care workers."
1,Avoid This Product,"I write very few reviews -- only when a product is superb, or truly misrepresented. Lane's Car Products Leather Scent has no leather fragrance whatever. Worse, it inhibits whatever leather odor may be left in your car's leather interior. If represented as a ""new car"" fragrance, that wouldn't be so far off. The product doesn't have a really bad odor; it's just not leather-like at all. Just as well, because the scent is gone by morning in any case. My recent-model Jaguar has fine leather seating with the scent just now beginning to fade. So I was looking for a product to restore the interior's presence. Lane's Leather Scent in no way meets that need. I've no idea why Amazon offers it for sale here. Other products do work; I used one in restoring an older Mustang and it was near-perfect. Take care. Lane's product is highly touted on Websites. I fell for it -- don't repeat my mistake."
3,Not quite leather smell,"Was hoping for a stronger leather smell to get rid of mustiness after trying charcoal and newspaper. Hoping to get the ""new car smell"" back--but didn't really work."
5,Car scent,"This stuff brings back the new leather smell in my truck, I get comments all the time about how good the leather smells,after a while the original scent wears off and this refreshes it,good stuff I highly recommend it!!"
5,The English business book everyone was looking for!,"This is the kind of English business book that gives plenty of subject for discussion and giveas the student the satisfaction of knowing that he or she is learning useful English. It is also complete and varied, can be used with any businessperson, no matter the area of interest."
2,Pass this one by,This book is OK for general tune up. But if you are going to pull apart the rear to change the clutch pack get another book. The rear shown does not even have the traction lok.
2,so so,This is not a completed tear down and repair manual. It's OK for some break downs. would recommend to do maintenance on your car.
2,"Lacking, and inaccurate.","I found this maunal incomplete, and inaccurate. The wireing diagrams have many errors. Though I have found it useful at times."
3,Dirty Dirty Dozen,"This version is somewhat fuzzy. Not crystal clear. My other discs are clear, so it is not my tv or player."
4,I've always prefered The Devil's Brigade,"I remember seeing this film when it originally played in the theaters in the summer of 1967 (the same summer as my favorite Bond Film, You Only Live Twice.) While I liked it a lot, especially the performances of Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson, who I was already a big fan of from ""The Great Escape"" and ""Battle of the Bulge,"" I was never that thrilled with the action sequences. I much preferred ""The Devil's Brigade,"" which was a much more exciting film, much larger in scale and actually had some truth behind it (although, of course, many aspects were Hollywoodized.) It also had a terrific cast starting with William Holden and Cliff Robertson and was directed by action veteran, Andrew V. Mclaglen. It has always been unfairly accused of being a Dirty Dozen rip-off. As stated, I think it is far superior and would loved to see it released on blu-ray."
3,Average,"I remember loving this movie as a young boy. The underdog winning against the odds, etc. But as an adult, it seems to pale in relation to other films on the genre and period. 'Kelly's Heroes' comes to mind. None-the-less, I think the all-star cast brings this film up a notch. The DVD is average to below average with some scratches and floating hairs to be expected of older non-restored films. The documentary was produced more as a promotional and only gives limited info on the making. A documentary to be seen once and never again. Overall decent value but one I wouldn't have in my collection unless you absolutely love WWII films."
3,Not as good as the book,"If you simply want to watch an average WWII movie, this is as good a choice as any. Lee Marvin does a good job and there is nothing really wrong with the movie. But I read the book when I was younger and it is MUCH better."
3,An Older War Movie That Doesn't Hide The Violence,"This was a very realistic World War II movie that (unlike most war movies of the time) didn't shelter the viewer from the violence of war. The acting is topnotch, and so is the action. Whether this movie is based on a true story or is fictional, I don't know. The only thing I didn't particularly care about was how the movie went from serious to comedy, then back to serious at the end. It should have been serious all the way through, and the comedy relief in the middle should've been left out. I was surprised at how this movie wasn't sanitized like most older war pictures though, that's unusual. Worth a watch."
2,Not good,"We have Blue Ray and a HD DVD players. The DVD of The Dirty Dozen I received will not play on either one I have. So, of course, I'm disappointed.Sherrie Nelson"
2,I should have avoided this one,"The Dirty Dozen does start kind of slowly and the premise is pretty silly, but things do pick up towards the end when the Dirty Dozen lock a bunch of partygoers in a cellar, douse them with gasoline, and kill them with hand grenades. Definitely recommended if you like that kind of stuff.Some reviewers have commented that this movie is making a point about the violence of war, but I don't buy it. You can't make 2 hours of frat-boy war movie then switch gears in the last 30 minutes and claim to be making a profound observation about brutality. There are plenty of good war movies that do have something to say -- Patton, Black Hawk Down, Das Boot, Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and Generation Kill come to mind. The Dirty Dozen does not belong on that list."
2,"A great cast, but nothing more. Am I missing something here?","After decades of high expectations, I finally saw THE DIRTY DOZEN for the first time on Cinemax and was very disappointed.The film, while offering an impressive all-star cast to rival THE LONGEST DAY, was more farcical than action-packed, more silly than dramatic and in the end, not very well acted, either. It was almost like watching a two-hour movie of HOGAN'S HEROES or F-TROOP.Some have called this ""a real man's action movie"". Am I the only one who noticed that Lee Marvin's character acts effeminately gay throughout most of the first half of the movie???In the end, I think the only good memory I will have of THE DIRTY DOZEN is Tom Hanks' reference to it in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE when he and his brother in-law sarcastically recall the climax like two weepy women.""Of course, I cried at the end of The Dirty Dozen.""""Well, who didn't."""
1,Review Of Dirty Dozen,Bought 2 movies of Dirty Dozen.. HD 1st 1 woulden't load.. & so stupid me bought another & that 1 would not load either.. I have 3 DVD recorders in my house and not 1 of them would play them.. Although Amazon did refund my money back on the 2nd 1..
5,Great movie,Great war movie. Great cast. Funny. Sad. Suspense all rolled into one movie. Great classic movie. As with all war movies some have to die.
2,New DVD is incredible,"2 stars refers to the OLD editions of the DVD (the first from MGM in 1998; the second and third from Warner in 2000 and 2005, respectively)The new DVD gets FIVE STARS, Finally! The 2006 release of the film contains an anamorphic 1.85:1 widescreen print, restored to its original glory (the colors look right and most of the print damage is cleaned up) and featuring a strong 5.1 Surround soundtrack. The disc contains a load of extras: the 1985 sequel, for starters; plus a trailer, vintage featurette, new documentaries, and a nice commentary featuring several of the film's ensemble cast etc., etc... throw your old DVD on eBay and buy this one TODAY!"
5,Dirty Dozen is nice and clean on HD!,"Wow...this HD presentation captures everything, including (much maligned) film grain. It is most likely a better presentation than this film had when originally released to theaters. Visuals are wonderfully clear, the print is exceptionally clean and the sound, for a movie almost 40 years old, is top shelf. This is definitely the version to own!!"
4,"Great DVD, Crappy package","While the DVD is sure to please, don't be lured into buying the special edition package. In this case the word ""original"" means brand new and not the original stills or lobby cards or even poster. The photos, on top of being murky and of forgettable scenes all say Turner Entertainment on them - obviously brand new and not original. Also don't get tempted by the original movie frame - i can only imagine that they made thousands of prints from the same ""original"" cel. Then again, if you're into reproductions this is the product for you. But, I think your money would be better spent on actual lobby cards or posters. Definately invest in the DVD but stay away from the limited edition packge."
5,An original script!,"Twelve is definitively a crucial number. Twelve angry men, Zodiac symbols, the number of members of a Jury . In this sense twelve men, condemned are invited to participate in a very hazardous mission : the core of the picture deals too with a management approach. The film looks aged but it maintains the essential elements to catch the viewer's interest: the cast is impressive and the frenetic action sequences still remain in the memory of a great audience. Marvin is superb and somehow this work threw to Sutherland to the fame. Well directorial effort of Aldrich."
5,Dirty Dozen with a Clean Print,"I ordered the Dirty Dozen on Blu-ray and was not at all disappointed. The print and transfer to Blu-Ray is outstanding.This film has an excellent cast, and Lee Marvin is at his best being Lee Marvin. The picture is a classic and will wear well with time. No pansies here."
3,"good movie, decent Blu ray ( bit grainy though )",Like:* good Price 10$* Good movie* Love the actorsDislike:* grainy Blu ray* the way they fall down when theyre shot loooll
3,Where's the movie?,"Am I missing something here? I try to stream this, and all it does is play a 3 minute trailer, no matter what button I hit. Do I need to hit something else? I've been watching other movies just fine, just this one is giving me problems. Was looking forward to watching this tonight."
5,Some Gung-Ho Types Think (Our) War Crimes Are Okay,"There are rules, even in war. You don't murder the civilians on the other side, that is, if you have any humanity or decency. And furthermore you, for darn sure, should not ""romanticize"" such activity. As far as Nazis and Nazi sympathizers goes, I'll say very few members of the German High Command were Nazis and that the only people who acted like Nazis at their worst in this film are our twelve ""heroes."" This film glorifies the basest behavior. It is pure brute evil, despicable, and a disgrace to the human race."
4,"Very quiet, very small","The Mac Mini is virtually silent. It X-Benches at around 118 (for the 1.25 gig model). That is faster than most of the later G4 towers. Disk performance is not so fast, but you hardly notice that in normal use. Recommended."
4,Base Configuration should have 512MB RAM,"Very happy with the machine, but it should have double the RAM as part of the standard configuration. Anything more than 2 apps running at one time and it slows down noticably.The software suite that comes with the machine is awesome. Easy to use and tightly integrated. I'm using this machine for digital photo management and for web surfing. No spyware/virus problems with my mini (so far!).As much as I like it, this machine doesn't have the omph to run the apps I really love, namely 1st person games. My AMD Athlon 1800+ with the same graphics chip (Radeon 9200) runs Call of Duty at high res with acceptable frame rates, while the mini is choppy running a demo version of the same game at 800x600.Oh well. That's why I'm running both my mini and my WINTEL machine with a KVM. I can always switch back and forth by tapping a few keys."
4,Apple Mac mini,"Pretty good. Small, low energy consumption, and quiet. I wish the CPU is a little bit faster."
3,A word of caution,"Apple has dropped Power Pc processors (PPC) in favour of Intel Processsors. That means that this item will not exist in future as offered now. It will cease to exist and become obsolete. Perhaps this will drive the price down, or perhaps not! It could go either way with no-one wanting one or become a hot collector's item. It's like buying stock. You could win or you could loose. Just thought all should be informed before deciding to purchase or not."
2,"Okay computing, but watch out for major design flaw!","The Mac mini works just fine. It's fast, it's quiet, and space-efficient. The one huge problem -- and maybe it's only been a problem for this family! -- is the fan located in the base of the unit. Spill even the smallest amount of coffee, water, or whatever near the unit, and whoosh, up it goes into your computer. Then, nothing. It is broken. Beware."
5,"Great Mac, but you can't get it for free!","(...)It is a well-known fact that these ""programs"" are run like pyramid schemes. Only the first few people to sign up actually got a Mac mini (it doesn't take a genius to see that you won't be the first sucker here). The rest just get heaps of telemarketing calls, junk faxes, and junk emails.I ought to know--I'm one of the chumps that was foolish enough to try! Please, learn from my mistake and don't help these jokers rope in any more people.The Mac mini is a great computer. (...)"
2,Serious Display Problems!!,"Please go to apple.com, and look at the discussion forum for the mini! hundreds of people are reporting serious display poblems with the computer. I have a brand new Samsung 193p lcd and am experiancing distortion and static. Apple are less then helpful, so far seem to be ignoring the problem, and simply stating that some displays are not compatible. please note the vast arrey of displays with the same issue.there is something wrong with the mini."
3,it's a book!,"I ordered this as a gift for someone else. I did not read it myself.It's a book, what do you expect me to say???"
1,Clear Parts Cement,"This glue was used to contruct the visible V-8 engine. If used moderately, it dries clear or invisiable. However if overdone, it will cloud up the glue joint."
5,"classical, or a creature of its own?","This was my first exposure to Schnittke, and it (the Concerto Grosso on this album) was hypnotizing. It sounded less like most classical pieces I'd been familiar with, and more like an hour-long trip of experimental mood textures built up upon each other, then destroyed dramatically, others thrust down your throat before you had a chance to take a breath (this is one of those few experiences when I sometimes had to remember to breath .. Dylan Thomas being another). It sometimes has the mood impression of a piece of 'trance' music, is sometimes wistful, sometimes angry, other times whimsical .. it is very hard to turn off after the first 10-15 minutes. The references to other classical pieces are also fascinating .. it is amazing how different familiar passages can sound couched in such different surroundings. This is a fantastic recording, and one which has changed my expectations for new music (classical or otherwise) forever."
1,Disappointed Reader,"There are far better books that can give you a perspective of these two countries. This author's work is nothing but an attempt propagating a prejudiced, if not condescending, view of Ethiopia. I find her outlook insulting and patronising to Ethiopians and Eritreans alike. It is like a poor attempt of a 90's travelogue Evelyn Waugh's style, as it is steeped in colonial hypocrisy and unabashedly patronising world view. A waste of my time, glad I didn't buy it, as I got it from a library."
1,Deyss - Vision in the Dark,Wish I could write a review on this product. I ordered it MONTHS ago from Amazon and kept getting extension emails and finally a cancellation that Amazon could not fulfill my order. I've received no emails from the people selling this item as used.Why is Amazon selling this item on their website if they do not have it in stock and/or cannot get it. Amazon should REMOVE the listing from their web site immediately.
5,Very Relaxing,"Excellent renditions of Webber's best compositions. Cannot find more Cd's by this author though. If you know of any, please email me."
4,The Great one strikes again,Domingo is a wonderful tenor. And there are wonderful choices. If only there were more.
4,does the job,"Everything arrived very quickly, parts were not damaged at all and all bulbs were intact as well. Could have used some assembly instructions for attatching the head of the lights to the shaft, but other than that it was fairly simple. It does not have a carrying case which was a bummer, but the lights were all that i expected them to be"
1,Bad News,Put in 2 fr wheel bearings 4 months ago and 1 is bad already. Must be made in China now. It's a lot of work to replace one. You don't want to do it twice.
5,PRAYERS OF PAUL,"An exellent work on the prayers of Paul, if you enjoy thoroughly detailed writing. I mean it takes 2 chapters for Colossians 1:11-12. Even if you don't agree with all Pink's theology, I believe you will still gain much from reading his books. He omits the prayer of Hebrews 13:20, 21, but that is contained in his book ""A Guide to Fervent Prayer."""
1,I can't wait to figure out what this was about,"I was very disappointed in this book. I only finished it because I was hoping the ending would bring meaning to the story. While several interesting characters were introduced in the book, really none of them get fully developed and while I like books which prompt me to think deeper this fell short of that."
1,Expected More&#65533;,"After reading Billy I could not wait to read this book. Mr. French took a different turn with this one. I didn't like the beginning and definitely didn't like the end. I didn't even finish the book, I skimmed to the end and started another. Maybe next time."
5,I want this sooooo bad!,"I was searching for cool bebop stuff and found this, now I want it! Ein is just so cute"
5,Awaken!,"This Mp3 download is incredible. I love different types of music for different reasons and emotions. I was looking for more meditative type music. I listen to and love a youtube video that contains track 4 from this album (Russill Paul) and love it. Now i have it as part of my music collection. The entire album is so beautiful and meditative. The sounds are very rich, complex and deep. The music on this album takes your mind away from everyday thoughts to a place of peace, joy and awakening. Highly recommended!"
3,warning: first edition,"First of all, I commend the authors on a timely and valuable book. However, a word of caution: this book is full of errors. Every couple of pages I am noting in the margin: did they mean A instead of B? Having encountered so many errors, I am reading every formula with scepticism. The errors are serious enough that I have trouble recommending the book without reservations, but I know of no suitable alternative. I can only hope that the errors will be weeded out of future editions."
3,"Time Machine, their roll was SLOW","I was excited with ""Slow Your Roll"" by Time Machine because of DJ Mekalek who is very respectable and featuring MC Jaysonic and MC Comel and this album was just okay. ""Time's Fly"" was simply uninteresting, ""Spelling Bee"" was supposed to be educational but seemed a but pointless. ""Personal Ads"" was funny in a good way. ""Stoerokinit,"" a strange title had a classical tune...interesting. The album's intentions were good but it overall did not succeed.The production had some bad and some great. ""Mind In A Spin"" ft. Edo G (that was one of the few good songs), ""Assembly Line"", ""Personal Ads"", ""A Cold Day In Hell"" and ""Especially 4 U"" were all special. These were mostly the album's good songs. And there was sampling involved like ""The Way Things Are"".I don't strongly recommend this album. C - average."
1,A really bad non-romance.,"My apologies to the author, but this book simply did not work for me. I felt no real chemistry between the 'hero' and heroine, just a lot of convoluted history. The 'hero' is especially weak, he may be traumatized by his beloved child's death, but he never does anything to prove or earn the love and respect of the true love he so callously jilted (over hurt feelings) - his whole reason for being there seems rather selfish and his regret at past mistakes rings false. What makes things even worse is when the heroine finds out all about it in a really long sob letter he has written to her, but kept in his desk. The guy was just too weak to care about. The heroine was a little better, but not by much as she was very weak as well. This one is a definite pass."
4,Very Easy To Picture As A Movie,"Well, this book is excellently written. Ian Rankin has done an exquised job. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the fact that it had many many different places and people that you had to keep track of. It often times got my confused. I advise to keep a notepad with this book explaining who people are and what they have to do with the story :-) Other than that, perfect. I'd love to see it on the big screen someday (even though Hollywood often screws up great novels)."
1,Boring,"It is my first and last book of Ian Rankin. The book is extremely boring, full of useless subplots, and I could not finish it.Everything goes around the personality of Detective Rebus, who is a proud alcoholist and an immature, self centered, asocial, negative and depressing character, with deep problems in relating with other people, expecially women. The other (and too many)characters are uninteresting and impossible to remember, because they are not described or analyzed. Everybody acts only and exclusively for interest, without sentiments or positive emotions. I cannot really understand the popularity of Mr Rebus."
2,A struggle to read,"Everything seemed to be going wrong for Inspector John Rebus. Tracking murderers, serial killers, with the mafia, press and his supervisors breathing down his neck, a wrong move may mean costly consequences.I found this book a struggle to finish from the start. I was not able to relate to John Rebus and found the book too dark, too complicated. The result is that I flipped through the pages, not really caring what happened in the end."
1,Quite boring!,"I am a great fan of the mystery genre and was looking forward to sampling a new author espeically after hearing such positive comments about Mr. Rankin's work. Frankly, I found the book boring and the story contrived. It just didn't have the edge I have come to expect in top mystery writing."
5,Rankin is the best,"I'm unfortunately reading these out of order, but Ranking keeps me interested and waiting for his next book to come in the mail....to bad not eligible for lenders library!"
1,black and blue inspector rebus novel,i am fond of the detective genre. i feel black and blue after making my way through this ponderous read. i read the kindle version.
5,An Excellent Read,"I'd heard some good things about Rankin, and this book was the first I read. While it's true the numerous plots can be somewhat confusing, they add to the realism; do any of us believe that police detectives only have one case assigned to them at a time? The darkness of Rebus' world, his cyncism and bitterness, combined with his stubborness and tenacity, give us a picture of a complete but flawed man. Rebus is a fully developed character, and for once we're given a portrait of a loose cannon that we can BELIEVE would continue to hold down a job."
5,Top stuff - by any genre standards,"I came to this book looking for something a little different. Having won several awards, I thought it would be good as a sampler of the crime genre. It is quite splendid. Human characters with the kind of flaws you have to accept in people you know and meet, in a familiar but grim surround, like viewing your own house after a burglary. I have since read several more Rebus novels and enjoyed damn near every page. The sharpness of the dialogue and the bold depictions are instantly memorable.The only downside is that I enjoyed 'The Hanging Garden' even more!"
4,Almost impossible to put down.,"I didn't know whether to curse or bless the friend who lent me this loooong whodunit! Great writing, good story, wonderful character and I spent an entire weekend reading. Rankin doesn't mask the horror of murder or the hard tactics used by police. But in the end we are glad the police are there. I'm off to read another."
4,A pretty good read!,"Not up to the pace of Michael Connelly, but still pretty good. I found it very slow until about a third through the novel - hence only four stars. But if you are waiting for your favorite author's next work, a nice way to pass the time."
2,Too confusing to enjoy fully,"I got about a third to a half way through this book and decided that I should start over again from the beginning! Yip... its that confusing! The plot is interesting, but there is just an attempt to cram too much in. I don't think I would read another of his books, and I wish I had read the reviews here and noted all the low scores instead of just going out and buying the book straight off. Steer clear... there are better books to read."
2,Dull,"This is the second Rankin/Rebus book I've tried. Mr. Rankin is clearly a skillful writer, but in the end I just didn't care about who and why, which is not good when reading a mystery/thriller. This required a real effort to finish, mainly due to the great amount of detail the author provides on subjects I didn't care about. Obviously there are many readers who enjoy Mr. Rankin's books, but I found this to be tedious. For other dark and troubled detectives (maybe not alcoholic), try John Harvey's Frank Elder series or Indridason's Inspector Erlendur series. Fortunately there are enough literary detectives for all tastes."
5,If there be thorns,"Once sold tales is awesome.I've ordered twice with then now, and we love what we get.I was getting older books from the 80's and they were in great condition."
2,disappointing,"i was so stoked at first when i got this ball, only to realize that it didn't feel like how it was supposed to. i already tested this ball out at my local sports store to get a feel for it and to buy it on amazon for way cheaper. first thing that struck out to me was the feel of the ball. feels like all the other generic ncaa indoor/outdoor balls. they use some cheap glossy material to make it seem 'moisture absorbent.' after that first clue that led to me skepticism, i compared the ball to the picture. the logo is off and the 'solution game ball' wasn't where it was supposed to be. i mean if you're going to sell some knockoff, at least make it believable."
2,Is it a reall Wilson NCAA Solution Game Ball basketball ??,"This is actually a question to Amazon:I just ordered one for $38 and it arrived yesterday.It does not look exactly the same as the picture shown on the Amazon website.It does not have the ""INDOOR [W] GAME BALL"" label under the Wilson logo.Is it really the solution game ball ?? Or did I just bought an imitation ?Wilson NCAA Solution Game Ball Basketball"
2,Exactly what we ordered...,"We give both the product and the provider five stars.Truly, we had shopped several BIG-name sporting goods stores and could not find this basketball at either of them...and then, we saw it on Amazon and it was delivered right to our door in perfect condition. It has already provided hours of free throws and ball-handling fun."
2,Just OK,Made of sythetic material.It almost good enough to use indoors but not worth the money... I would not but another...
1,awful,this ball doesn't hold air and needs to be pumped up again every day. how can i return it? It is a defective product. I'll be happy to return so you can see for yourself.
4,Great ball but...,"This is a great basketball but I have to admit it does not last as long as the TF-1000. I organize 2 runs a week for 3 hours. We use this ball about 6 hours a week. In bout 3-4 months the ball has no grip. We play indoor only. It's definitely taken a beating and has lots of cuts and scuffs in it. I have a TF-1000 that is over a year old and it still has better grip than the 6 month old Wilson. Don't get me wrong, this ball is amazing. The weight and balance is slightly better than the TF-1000 but I deducted 1 star for the fact that the grip didn't last as long as the similar product."
5,basketball,"Good ball for indoor courts. Cannot beat the price, with free shipping ! Arrived quickly, too."
2,Good for kids younger than 2,"Okay, I'm not one to write reviews normally, but I had to for this one. Either my daughter is a genius, or this ""game"" is LAME. Although she is 2 1/2 and has known her alphabet since she was 2, and has been able to count to 10 even before that, I thought maybe this would be fun for her to try. First of all, two of the ""games"" aren't games at all - the shapes one is just a video of a bird drawing 4 shapes, and then it's over. No interaction at all. The animal one is just lessons on different animals, and the joystick controls which animals you view, but it's not a game either. The alphabet game only teaches a few letters, and that's it. You would think it would teach all 26, but no. The ""feeding the pig"" game counts to 10, but doesn't do much. And the whole DVD intermittently uses the same puppets that were in the infant games. My daughter likes to play this thing, but gets bored quickly. I'll save it for my next child, and introduce it to him much earlier."
4,Nifty little gadget,"I love it. Works great attached to the proper discs manufactured to accomodate the light. I have a basket in my yard and even in the middle of winter, I enjoy practicing with the lighted discs at night. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the price. A tiny light like this should definitely only be a dollar or two."
2,P & M swim the Moldau while whistling preludes,"As he so often did, Karajan homogenizes these works to the point where everything sounds the same. Beautiful, but the same. These pieces may not be at the pinnacle of classical music, but the Moldau in particular deserves a lot better than this. Look further."
1,A review blinded by stock prejudice.......,"I'll just be clear. This is not a good recording and you can find and listen to much MUCH better work from Czech conductors such as Smetacek, Talich, and Ancerl.Kubelik's ""Vltava"" (NOT Moldau) with the Boston Symphony is wonderful.I thought ""Santa Fe"" listener would appreciate me using his uneducated jab as a title for my dislike of this CD.Oh, I forgot, Karajan is untouchable."
4,Good,"I found this book very provocative. The anecdotal comments throughout the book, personal accounts on each campaign and method which the author introduces character sketches as the applicable historical figures come into context were refreshing and enlightening. Despite references to Maps in the appendixes of the book, I found the author's description of tactics and battle movements to be somewhat confusing at times. I was a little disappointed with the amount of attention given to the last years of Napoleon the 1st's reign. All in all, a good, enjoyable read. DPS"
2,More Jimmy Wang Yu Swordplay,The kingfu was fast at times and slow at times with the major martial arts being swordplay. The storyline was good with revenge the theme with the a woman as the hero. Her kungfu was slower than slow. It was entertaining though and it won't put you to sleep. I just prefer more hand to hand combat. Buy if you are a classic martial arts collector only.
5,Seeing Voices- A wonderfully written eye-opener!,"""Seeing Voices"" was a beautifully written book that managed to express many things that other books on the deaf can't even begin to formulate. Oliver Sacks managed to balance facts and stories with heartfelt emotion, in a way that is truly an eye-opener, even for one who has worked with the deaf for many years as I have.His footnoting, which it has been mentioned is quite extensive, adds immense insight, knowledge, and understanding to the book. I have recommended ""Seeing Voices"" to countless people, hearing and deaf alike, and every one of them has come away from reading it with their inspiration rekindled, their compassion renewed, and a much better understanding of sign as it relates to human nature."
4,It is a very interesting and educating book!!!,This book is awesome. I want to be an interpreter and thishelps me to learn more about the culture so it is very helpful. Ihave read many other books about deaf culture too. You will ebjoy this book.
2,Not my favorite,"I loved some of his other books like ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat"" and his autobiography so this was a dissappointment. I didn't even finish it, not rivited to the page as I was by other books."
2,Struggling to read!,"This book is extremely difficult to wade through as there are an endless amount of footnotes and one feels as if they will never get to the ""real"" story. There is, however, a lot of valuable historical information about deafness and the obstacles the deaf population has had to endure. Many times during the reading of this book, I was struck with the awareness that I hadn't even considered certain aspects of living in a hearing world as a deaf person that seemed obvious upon reading them. The book is enlightening but a struggle to read."
1,Big disappointment - better lists elsewhere,"Lots of other pet travel books have lists of hotels and motels that accept pets, but without much description. I hoped this book would provide narrative descriptions of great vacations possibilities with my dog, but, apart from a section on ""Dog Camps"", was only another (and not very good) listing of accommodations that accept dogs. For that, the AAA Book is better. How about a book that features the BEST places that cater to dogs and their owners (e.g. with special pet services, doggy 'day care', dog runs) rather than just tolerate them. I'd love a book with 50 or 100 great places that cater, with descriptions and reviews, rather than another list of places that accept dogs. Besides this, its just poorly printed. Save your money."
4,Apricots for eating,Good taste. Took a long time to get shipped but they were worth waiting for. Good price as well.
2,Not much taste,"I wanted to avoid sugar so I ordered this. I like to add dried fruit to my cereal. They are close to tasteless. I have purchased other organic dried fruit and did not have that problem. However, my dog loves them. Begs for them. They are an inexpensive dog treat!"
2,Good introduction for those unfamiliar with the theme,"This was a short book that focused on the interplay between getting to know yourself and getting to know God. I didn't get a lot out of the book, probably because it is short and because I've already been hearing and thinking a lot about the true self/false self and self-awareness issues for a while now. The book reminded me to spend more time meditating on gospel stories and to not take myself too seriously, but it didn't expose me to anything that I hadn't already been thinking about a lot. It may be very helpful for those who hadn't heard its message before and I hope that such people can get this book in their hands as a good introduction to such themes, but those who are already interested in the journey of self-discovery probably need a more in-depth read."
5,Great reflections,"This book leads us to pause and reflect on knowing ourselves in the context of knowing God. This includes the good, bad, and the ugly. This is an important idea which has been largely unexplored by religious communities. I found some gems here that are catalysts for becoming a whole person. While some parts of the book were more engaging than others, the concept the author introduces is fundamentally important."
5,Great read!,I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to grow in their relationship with God and in their understanding of themselves.
3,Good foundational book,"This was a good foundational book. The young that recommended this loved this book, and why I wouldn't rate it is high for me it was a good read and drew me into God's Presence."
1,"Interesting idea, poorly done.","I was very dissapointed in this book. I started out very interested since the premise pulled me right in. A house in Scotland that ""just appeared"" in 1939? Whomever approaches it dissapears? Who wouldn't be hooked in. When I read it though, the house was not mentioned until halfway through the book, there were so many loose ends (What happens with the young girl? Did they all die? To top that off, it read like a first draft. I half-expected to see scribbled notes in the margins and I didn't feel anything but nearly pushed through the book. It felt hurried, forced and lacked any life. No spark, no nothing. It was supposed to be terror filled, a *horror* novel, and I felt zilch, nothin'. Save your money and skip this novel. It is not worth it in my opinion."
1,"what, where, who, what??????/","This ""novel' is all over the place. Frankly, I'm shocked that it got published at all. Elaine is its only plausible character. The rest is just a kind of schzophrenic nightmare. The ""house"" itself doesn't appear until you're too tired to care and the jumping from one disjointed scene to the next is just exhausting. One of the most distinguishing features of great literature is that the reader is ALWAYS drawn into a compelling storyline. Whether it's ""The invisible Man"" or, say, ""Dracula,"" the story and its characters successfully build on one another. The reader is drawn into the writer's imaginary world and carried away. I don't ever want to feel outside a piece of literature. I want to feel a part of the setting: the sounds, the light, the drama."
4,"Ah, all the lonely people","Douglas Coupland writes so eloquently in Liz Dunn's voice, that it's almost too hard to believe she's the loner she claims to be. I know people who consider themselves to be real ""people people"" who don't have half the pizzazz, power of intuitive observation and witty repartee that Liz has. The ""one Scrabble tile with nothing written on it"" is actually the most valuable piece in the game, capable of making something out of almost anything. This book is a joy -- well written and fun to read with a heroine you can't help but like and wonder about when the story ends."
4,There's Just Something Inviting About Coupland's Work,"Douglas Coupland's writing has a nature about it that is refreshing to find in literature. It's inviting, in that the characters make you feel interested in their stories. I first read this novel when I was in high school and was reading between classes. I recently have read it again and its still a great read. In an age where most authors lack that spark that draws the reader in, Coupland makes it seem effortless."
2,Not Quite Sure What The Author Had In Mind...,"Okay, if you're an avid reader you've probably read many books about lonely people, how they cope, and how they inevitably find peace of mind, contentment, true love,death,etc etc. Basically, this author takes all those plot twists and incorporates them in a very crazy fashion throughout. Many of these twists were quite a stretch - I couldn't quite understand if he wanted this book to be humorous, or just plain strange. Another problem - he writes in first person narrative as the female main character, and many of her mannerisms and ideas just didn't ring true. I have found VERY few male authors who can write well in female first person narrative - and it definitely does not fly here. I'll accept previous reviewers' testaments that this author is a better writer than this book portends - but I'll find it difficult to pick up another one of his book's in th future."
2,Hey Coupland!,"I was in shock as I was reading the rave reviews for this novel. I can't believe anyone enjoyed this book even half as much as Coupland's other novels. I've read all his books, fiction and non-fiction, and this is by far the least Coupland-esque book I've ever read. It was mundane and typical. I'll admit, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. And, that's saying something. I have to finish books. It's the OCD in me. I hate an unfinished book. But, this was just painful. I couldn't do it. Even the writing was different. I can appreciate the novel, even the worst books I can appreciate, but it is definitely the worst of Coupland's amazing collection."
2,Missing Something....,"I enjoy most of Coupland's writing for it's subtle (sometimes not subtle) analysis of contemporary society and culture. I felt this book was devoid of any real substance - other than a few critical parts on ""loneliness"", most of the book I found to be rather uninteresting and mediocre at best. At times I felt like Coupland was trying too hard with some of the plot twists and character motivations."
2,Unlovable loser makes an unbelievable u-turn,"This is my first Coupland book, and based on it, I may not pick up another one.The main character, Liz, is the human equivalent of a potted plant. She lives a life of loneliness and quite frankly, relishes it. All of a sudden, she gets reunited with the son she had in high-school, product of a one-night stand on her class trip to Rome. Mind you, this was her first and only sexual encounter. Her son is the picture of beauty, such a gentle soul, despite having been molested in every single foster home he lived in.So as not to ruin the plot for some of you, who may want to adventure into it, suffice to say the ending was terribly unplausible from the moment she gets contacted by the Austrian police."
4,A Great Read,"I was first intrigued by this book of the name, ""eleanor rigby"" being my favorite beatles song about a very lonley girl. The cover of the book also caught my eye. I was excited to read it, and it definitely met my expectations. It was hard to put down; Douglas Coupland is an excellent story teller, unravelling his details at the most perfect moments. I was able to relate to some of the feelings that Liz, the main character had. It was a very narrative story, which I enjoyed. In the end, all parts came together, which made the book seem as a whole. The ending I am still somewhat unsure of, I only finished the book about 15 minutes ago. It definitely makes you think about some of the aspects discussed in the book. A great and easy read with some laughs along the way. :)"
3,Like a generic store-brand version of Coupland,"If I had picked this as my first Coupland read, I would not have been disappointed. It's enough by itself for a quick & interesting read.However, this is not my first Coupland read and I was hoping for more.Characters lacked depth and too much of the story depended on themes repeated from previous (more successfully executed) plots.We're either too spoiled by his preceding works, or too jaded to be nostalgic for the comfort of avocado green appliances."
5,Charles De Lint Original Faery Tale/Folk Tale,"This book is a prequel to ""Seven Wild Sisters"", and focuses on the character of Lillian, a free-spirited orphan, who lives with her aunt, miles away from others. She is an independent and free spirit who leaves food for wild cats and seeks fairies in the wild forest and countryside. This is a magical, lyrical, and original fairytale written by Charles de Lint. Charles Vess' illustrations, in color throughout the book, are superb! Today it is rare to find an original faerytale that isn't a retelling of a classic tale. I recommend this book to all age groups, and most especially to those who love cats and faerytales. I predict that this book, along with the others in the series, will be cherished and read for years to come!"
2,Not the Workbook for a Young Adult,"I thought this would be a workbook to help get and keep a job. Instead it is more of a self journey. Not a bad thing for someone to do, but not what is needed when the person with AS is prone to sabatoging her efforts without realizing it. It would have been nice to have had some assistance in getting the first couple jobs in life."
1,Another contender for the no star award...,"There was a time when I loved Chris Claremont's stuff. Fall of the Mutants, Mutant Massacre, any tale he told of the Hellfire Club, Dark Phoenix...I could go on, but I won't.Why? Because this interminable, derivative crapfest, as written by Claremont, shows that he's ready to retire. He's obviously out of fresh ideas. Hell, he's ripping his own old stuff off, and badly! And I agree with the other reviewer about Igor Kordey. He should be arrested for gratuitous abuses with a pencil. His illustrations look like he took art lessons at the Braille school. They're not even illustrations, or drawing, even. ""Pick-choors"" maybe, if you're from Alabama (no offense, go Tide!)How can someone who gave the X-men his best care so little about them now. It's like catching up with a couple who were passionate after the nuptuals, but can't stand to touch each other while they sleep years later. And the X-men have definitely started sleeping in the spare room..."
4,Highly recommended,"Well written, good story with a few twists. I didn't guess the v last one but it was nonetheless a bit of an anti climax"
1,Worst Struts EVER,Do not buy these struts...cheap knock offs and make a lot of noise...worse than what I had on my car. Had to have them replaced within 3 months and could not return them or get a refund from Amazon...stay away!!! Last time I buy any auto parts from Amazon or Ebay...go to your local auto parts store...at least they stand behind their product. It is not worth your time or money to buy from here.
5,My car has shocks!,Worked great for my 2000 toyota camry - didn't realize how bad my shocks were until we replaced them and my car gained a 2 inch lift!
5,Monroe 171678,"Installed on a 1997 Toyota Camry with 180,000 miles. These Monroe Quick-Struts are the most economical choice, they made my car drive and ride better than when it was new. Highly recommend."
5,Super Smart Lady,"The best thing about Chris Turner's ideas is that they are so easily applied in the workplace - any workplace. The book is very thought-provoking. Every person in an organization can ""create the future now"" by applying these principles. My only wish is that this book be required reading for every white male over 30."
4,The Pop-Ups don't,"The first thing that happened when I opened this book is that the Statue of Liberty fell out into my lap. Then I discovered that the Empire State Building doesn't actually pop up; you have to pry it up, and hope that you're not wrecking something in the process. This is true of most of the ""pop-ups"" in the book. Also, lift-up tabs get in the way of some of the pop-ups (or vice-versa). I'd say it's a lot of clever ideas badly executed. Probably the makers were trying to do too much. But in spite of all this, I still like it, and if you collect pop-up books, you probably will too. Just be ready to re-construct and re-glue a lot of the stuff."
3,"Nice, but badly made","A wonderful carnival of a book, and like many carnivals it has problems if you look closely. The pop-ups aren't always easy to work, and one piece tends to get fouled up on another. In addition, there are a LOT of little booklets and enclosures- many of them great in themselves but they tend to fall out of the book into your lap. Then you've got an evening of ""Where the #@&&%^! did THIS go?"" ahead of you.Still, it's a love poem to NYC, with all the best intentions."
2,Very disappointed,I have to use my fingers to make them pop-up. Not interesting pop-ups at all-- just plain and simple.
5,The New York Book Of The Millenium,"This book the best i've seen as Marie Salerno puts together a book that is marvelous. The best piece was definitely the Federal Reserve Piece. This is the number one book I've seen in my 12 years of living, and it's great for both kids and adults, this will make the Holidays fun for kids and adults and a great present."
3,Not complete,"The Top of the Empire State Building are not in the book. The edges of the the book are really in a bad condition.I think, it's a seller problem!"
2,It didnt tell me much that I would of wanted to know.,"WACK!!?? The author could of told more about him then ,rather what the man then did in his life !! But dont get me wrong it wont so bad . But the author should try again.I'm out...... Rashawnna"
1,Very Sad,"Ms. Gourse's biography does not, in my opinion, do justice to this legandary jazz artist. I was hoping for some improvement over her biography on Sarah Vaughan, however, my opinion is that Ms. Gourse's Carmen McRae bio takes her down a few more notches as a biographer/writer. I almost got the feeling that it was slapped together quickly due to publishing deadlines or a general lack of interest in the subject."
1,"Error-filled, poorly written","Poorly researched, poorly written, with no real insight into the life of Ms. McRae. Avoid."
2,It's a start,"If you are completely unaware of how you affect other people, this is a good start. For more help see Verbal Judo by ThompsonVerbal Judo: The Gentle Art of Persuasionor Anger by HanhAnger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames"
2,one trick pony,The chapters on religion and litigationare right on the money. Unfortunatelythe book is a one joke affair which eventuallybecomes too repetitive.
5,"Side-Splitting Humor and Truth, Too!","This is a must read for anyone who has ever worked for, lived with, or encountered a**holes in all their numerous iterations (and they are everywhere). For those who still harbor the hope that a**holes will change their behavior and become human beings, Dr. X. Crement rapidly makes these dreamers understand the futility of this desire. Not only does Dr. X. identify they types of a**holes, he offers excellent suggestions in how to deal with or, better yet, escape from them.This book is the perfect gift for someone who is in the throes of trying to get out of a relationship with an a**hole of either sex, be it personal or professional.Highly recommended!"
5,"Excellent music, excellent renditions","Most people viewing this item probably haven't heard of Borodin before, and I must assure such people that the Borodin quartet on this recording is more than worth listening to! The star of these three compositions is, of course, the American quartet, which is legendary. Though I haven't listened to any other performers playing the quartet, the Emerson Quartet's sound is exquisite, with each detail executed to perfection. You can't expect much else - the Emerson Quartet is always great.I usually don't like Tchaikovsky, but the quartet on this recording is wonderfully melodic. And together, these three quartets on one CD make for one great purchase.Great sound, great performance, great music - at a great price. What else could you ask for?"
3,New Age perspective,"This Christian literature is not too biased, giving their viewpoint on New Age Spiritualist followers who would like to revive ancient civilisations. The Christian viewpoint is to focus on negative activities of those ancient civilisations. Whereas, New Age Spiritualist focusses on the positive activities, and only wants to revive those. The book also mentions us New Age Spiritualist followers being obsessed with failures, like artefacts from ancient Egypt. This is not true. It's a case of having another broadminded look at what was destroyed."
4,Under Exposed is right...but still a good cd,"Acts 29 Under Exposed is a fitting name for this cd because you prob never heard of them in mainstream circles. The cd is a truly good one but not great.There are no outstanding jams beside ""Confessions"" but the remaining songs are good and deal with issues like dating the unsaved, stealing and disappointing God. The cd is definately worth the purchase but its not one that you will blast in the car on your way home. It will however minister to you and I guess that is the most important thing.Feel free to get it, it will compliment your collection"
3,Pretty Nice,"Acts 29: Under Exposed (Syntax, 2001)Unique and mellow blends of sound envelope relateable lyrical concepts. Check out ""Missionary Dater"", a song that explores the dangers of dating an unsaved person. Of special note is background singer, Tiffany Simpson, who makes the project extra special with her terrific vocals.For fans of: Q Tip/ Saved Young MinistasPick hits: Sweet Tooth/ Overnight/ Missionary Dater/ Family Life/ Confessions."
3,Crystalcell CV100 violin case,"This case is extremely light weight. It is not as protective as most cases of this category. The violin wobbles around a bit in the case but I really can't complain too much. It is half the price of cases in this style and category (and little cheaper made). If you're looking for a sufficient and inexpensive case this is fine-it works. If you want something that can withstand years of use, spend a little more, as in no less than twice as much."
2,I expected much more,The cd could have been twice as phat first they need to have there beats ryme and not just talk on a mic while some music's playin this cd is wak it doesn't show there potential even though everyone know's they have a chance in the underground circut
1,TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!,"Beats?Terrible.Rhymes?Ultra Horrible.Album?UselessDon't buy this. I sold it back. Just from the internet exposure, and what I heard, I thought it to be groundbreaking; no it was earshattering IN THE WORST WAY!!!!!!!! Every song sucks. It's useless.Peace!!!!!!!!!!P.S. Amazon would not let me rate it 0 stars."
2,Good book.,This is a good book but I think it's overpriced which is why book sales are down. It gave me good ideas but pricey for what you get.Good photos
2,Not a serious book,"I expected a more scholarly work and and right in the first chapter, the author struck me with his hipothesis: jewish people are exceptional because they are ""mercurial"". I give it two stars because I do agree with the title, this is indeed the jewish century, a process that has been slowly in the making since the 15th century."
5,Fascinating book.,"I wonder whether it occurred to Dr. Slezkine that the Jewish-supported overthrow of the czars and establishment of the Communist regime in Russia led not only to the Stalin-Hitler pact of 1939 and hence to World War II and the Holocaust, but also to the founding of the modern state of Israel."
4,Torn between three homelands...,"This is a book for Jews and Gentiles alike. Most of us non-jews have probably thought we had heard everything there is to know about Jewry in the 20th century from the numerous accounts of the Holocaust, the founding of Israel etc.Not so!This book looks at how East European jewry in the post-Czarist period found itself drawn to three rival and sometimes contending spiritual homelands. In short Revolutionary Russia, Zionism and Israel and immigrant America. Slezkine illustrates the tensions and interactions between the ""three homelands"".Slezkine reminds us that there is a lot more to the Jewish story than the most well known themes. A fascinating read that helps the reader better understand how the 20th century unfolded."
4,"Could Have Been Better, But Still Amazing","This was a great CD, all the best ARP songs ore there, great showcase of all the talent in the band. Just one amazing live album. I think if they played more songs it might have been better, maybe just like Oceans of Time, and maybe even a ballad or two just to get Johnny's vocals in there even more.Overall awesome live album, one of my favorite CD's ever.Check out the DVD, its even better !!!!"
3,"A useful book for the specialist, less for amateurs","The value of this and similar primary sources to the specialist should be obvious. I did find that the way the letters were organized -- by year and then by writer -- was confusing. Perhaps it would be better to group all the letters by one author together.The amateur may be disappointed by the fact that, like many if not most Civil War primary sources, these letters describe rather little action. The editors have left idiosyncratic spellings as is, which I like, but which does make the material a little more difficult to read."
3,It's southern rock and it's alright,"""A better road"" is an album with previous unreleased tracks and new material. Often there's a reason why songs haven't been released earlier and I would say that Doc Hollidays' self titled album is better than this one. Sometimes, like in ""Angels in waiting"" it sounds exactly like Smokie (remember ""Living next door to Alice""?). If that's good or bad is up to you to decide. This album includes a good cover of Thin Lizzy's ""Jailbreak""."
3,a good book,"It's a great book with good stories. It's a collection so you have to like ""collections."" The shipper was terrific and the price was great. I got the book faster than predicted and the ""handling"" portion of the cost...often a place for markjup...was a really good deal. Congratulations to sellers who resist the urge to make money by adding a couple of bucks to the price through ""handling.""thanks..."
5,Incredibly beautiful!,"I must admite that I had not heard these songs before. However, just hearing the first notes and I was completely absorbed. The sensual, ethereal and beautiful voice of Von Otters voice goes perfectly well with the quality and mood of these beautiful songs. I was really surprised with the beauty and tranquility of these songs. This is another side of Berlioz I had not expected.I really recommend this record to you. Just hear it once and you'll love it!"
2,Psychedelics Ruined This!,"Maybe if you'd seen this in the early '70s, you might think it was hip. But today, it looks like somebody, high on acid, was working the knobs. Otherwise great Tina Turner performances are chopped up, with the picture moving in different directions and all the best parts lost because some ""engineer"" thought he was being clever and making Tina ""more' exciting.Tina sings her butt off, but the whole thing is ruined by the picture we see. Better if you just close your eyes."

4,Salt Lantern,"Salt Lantern by William Towner Morgan is an in-debth study of a man and his relationship with the home he was born and raised in. The story he weaves includes his personal recollections, other family members' recollections, as well as a chronological history of the structures his ancestors lived in over the centuries.Salt Lantern is also a personal history of the various branches of Morgan's families--in England, Ireland, early America, and into the Twentieth Century. It appears he was born after the sudden death of his father, he was raised in a household of women, and he grew up not really understanding his place in the family.Morgan seems to become the Salt Lantern, an artifact that has signifigant meaning within the family, but is not really understood. Morgan explores his own birth, life, and relationships through the structures he studies and describes.This is a study of history, architecture, family relationships, and personal memoir. A good read."
1,Waste of money,"Bulb not received by Christmas. Also when it finally did come, it only lasted a week before blowing out. What a waste of money!"
5,"Beautiful work, a keepsake","I was tremendously pleased with my Rosary. The beads are beautiful and the handwork is excellent. I ordered this gift for a friend and when it came, I knew that I would want one for myself, too."
1,Bad Ceramics Bad Color,"First, Cappuccino is not green. Perhaps it is in China, where these are manufactured. The photograph is deceptive. The canisters are an odd greenish, something or other color, not the sophisticated tan/brown/cappuccino color shown. I know monitor differences. I am an artist and I have a kick monitor. I note another customer ended up with greenish as well.On the plus: The cannisters arrived unbroken and in good shape.On the minus, the middle sized canister was defective in that it was out of round, and the lid (which is round) does not fit unless I remove the silicon ring supposed to keep moisture out. This wasn't any microscopic defect. The canister was so obviously out of round, it's astonishing to me this one made it past quality control.So. I have one cannister that doesn't work as anything but a key and change repository and the expense of repacking all this and shipping it back for another green set just isn't worth it."
