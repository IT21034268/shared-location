1,"Boring script, boring music","This movie was an absolute bore. there was no chemistry between the characters...the music was long and dull. My husband slept through it and I fast forwarded through the ""music."" The characters weren't endearing. The best part was the scenery."
1,Once,I was expecting a much better love story with what was written about it. It was terrible! Then at the end we were waitin g for the end and there was none. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Also very hard to understand at times.
5,Great Movie...Great Amazon seller,"Loved the movie for most of the same reasons so many others have detailed. Got the DVD because I wanted the extras, the commentaries, etc. And this review is about the seller: RainyDayEntertainment, Just-4-Josh as I ordered 7/26, it was postmarked 7/27 and I got it across the country 7/29. Wow, that's service. I've ordered items from other Amazon resellers and have waited a couple of weeks, and sometimes it never arrives (they send a refund, but I wanted the item!). I will order DVD's from RainyDayEntertainment again!!"
5,Super Musical Movie,"I had seen this movie before and loved it then. So when I saw it was for sale at Amazon I had to have it. I also followed up with a purchase a few months later of, ""The Swell Season"" at The Artist's Den with Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Just saw that and loved it too."
2,Poor Quality,"The video was well packaged, but of poor quality. At times, the video and sound track did not match, and the general quality of the video was poor. I am not sure if this was a ""bootleg"" shot on a hand-held camera in the movie theater, but it was not at all first quality.I am disappointed with this purchase."
4,Super,"Yes, we saw the play in New York and was told it was a movie.So when we got home from NYC I ordered the movie online.Not as good as the Play but certainly worth it to hear the phenomenal music."
4,Once,"I liked it I'll watch it again , I've been to Dublin so it brought back memories , and it had a feel good feeling"
3,"Not good/not ""bad"".....","Not really much of a story. Nice movie for killing time I guess, but not a real gripping story. Found myself wondering how much time was left a few times throughout the movie."
4,"Quite Excellent, well worth watching more than once","The cover quotes a prominent Chicago Tribune reviewer as saying this may well be the best music film of our generation. That alone made me expect it to suck. But guess what? I agree with the guy.Now I can analyze why, or I can quote the back cover, or I can do both. But those words would probably make you less likely to watch this gem, not more. So I'm stopping.I think it's excellent, like it says in my review title. And that's all I can say."
5,If you are looking for Hollywood Great this movie is not it...,"however if you want something that is more intimate then check out Once. The acting isn't great, the music isn't even perfect and there are more directing problems than I can mention. That made up the charm of this movie though. I felt like I was watching a home movie made to show a moment in time of ""guy"" and ""girls'"" lives. They were real and with our hyper-entertainment real is boring for most but if you keep watching you will be drawn in. I loved the way that guy sang better at the end of the movie than at the beginning, girl inspired him and motivated him. That's what good relationships do, they make us better. The ending is not fairy-tale but I am so happy that they kept it a good moral ending, so unlike Hollywood where lust and passion nearly always takes over. I was left feeling rather melancholy, the music is haunting and stays with you."
4,"Good movie but not ""out of the top draw""","I read really good rave reviews about the movie and I rented this DVD with a lot of expectations. I thought the movie was a pretty good movie with a good soundtrack. The acting was decent considering that their acting experience. I expected the movie to be spectacular but it was not in that league. Nevertheless, a good DVD rental."
5,Outstanding,Glen has a terrific voice and his music is inspiring and uplifting. This was a fantastic movie.
5,An Amazingly Unique Film for a Great Price,"Order this movie now if you have a good taste in cinema!! I heard about Carney's film (Once) from the now-famous play recreation. This film is the epitome of low-budget, d.i.y. masterpieces. It delivers a non-typical story that contains an wonderful journey to an unlikely ending, unlike 90% of the utterly hackneyed movies produced in the mainstream culture of the film industry. To sum it all up, purchase a copy of this DVD or rent the movie if you want to experience a refreshingly exciting filmic adventure."
4,Lacking in substance but rich in music,"The movie watcher should not expect a scintillating plot from ""Once"" but the music lover will cherish the crux of the movie - the music. With haunting melodies and intriguing timing, the music will stay in your mind for days. You'll want to buy the soundtrack CD just to hear it as often as you can. You will not be surprised that the song ""Falling Slowly"" won an Oscar for best original song in a movie in the 2007 Academy Awards. Glen Hansard's beaten up and ragged looking guitar still makes wonderful music in his hands. His voice, along with Marketa Irglova's, combine beautifully to make the music unforgettable."
3,"Multiple items, multiple degrees of performance","I ordered a number (5 or 6) of items at one time. I followed your instructions and I was sort of surprised at how they shipped. Also disappointed in some communications (NOT WITH AMAZON). With concern for the timely delivery of items I agreed to multiple shipments, it seemed like each item came seperately. Might have made more sense to put into one box, maybe lower cost? Also tried to find out how to return an item you don't stock but the shipper chose to ignore requests for info on a return. At this point do not know if this has been resolved.My only suggestion would be to be more clear in your instructions and info on different ship dates for multiple itms. Ultimately I may just have misunderstood what you would do and when.Overall I'd give Amazon a B+ on this order, maybe even A-!Thanks for the opportunity. Fred Wordell"
2,language warning; misleading promo,"I didn't make it past the first five minutes. The language, when I could understand it, was profanity-rich (f-bombs galore). The first song was okay, but I turned the film off before the second song ended.Perhaps it got better, but I wasn't inclined to invest the time to find out."
1,Once is too many times to see it,"I agree with the 1 star reviewers. Once is too raggedy in every which way. The music was totally uninteresting (except just one song in the studio scene in 5/5 time, that one was near to just okay). Self endulgent documentary/home type movie (there are better home movie youtubes then this flick. I can't believe folks like this one."
1,Once is enough,"I bought this movie after falling in love with the song and seeing the video. I was not impressed with the movie though. I enjoyed most of the music, but I expected to see a movie NOT a musical. The copy that I bought froze, which hopefully was just the copy that I purchased. The movie seemed to drag out and left the viewer waiting for something to happen. I also found myself changing the volume throughout the film because of the inconsistency in the recording. Once was enough for me and I LOVE independant films especially when they center around the UK."
5,"Greatest movie of all time...no, really","I first saw this movie at a friend's apartment two years ago and had never heard of it at the time. I remember thinking, man, this movie is going to suck, after watching the first ten minutes because it was kind of slow. But the second the first song was sung, I was completely hooked, and by the end I was almost cheering it was so good (it had been awhile since I'd seen a REALLY good movie). I don't know how to explain why this movie is so good besides the fact that it is so REAL. The cast is fantastic, the storyline has a nice twist to it, and the music, oh the music. This movie contains some of the most raw musical performances I've ever seen, Glen Hansard sings with so much emotion you're on the edge of your seat every time. I bought this movie on DVD and basically gave it to everyone I know this Christmas. So far, everybody (and it was a rather diverse group) has loved it. I could watch it all day."
3,Sweetly Simple,"I purchased this movie because the Broadway play ""Once the Musical"" received 8 Tony awards.I have tickets to see it and wanted some background. Let me say that I have always preferred live musicals as opposed to cinematic musicals.That said it was just ok for me. Luckily the price was right."
3,Ounce,"The second CD (american tour) did not play & the movey track skips, the movey DVD was OK.These were new (not used) CDs"
5,Simple and surprising,If you see this and have like it. Make it a point to see the broadway production of it. Adding words to reach 20!
5,once,"One of the best musicals I have ever seen, both original and top notch folksy/rock music with classical elements. Glen and Marketa are refreshing together and my whole family has turned into Swell Season and Frame fans to the point of attending their live concerts which are also awesome. This is the organic format future musicals should be using. An incredible first film. If only there could be a TWICE."
2,Bleh,"This wasn't a movie I would watch again. I love the song they sing, but the rest of the movie is a chore to watch."
3,Hmmmmmm,I had read rave reviews of this movie and couldn't wait to watch it. I was a little disappointed with it after all the hype.
5,Enjoyed all aspects of this movie.,"The music was great. The story was real and emotional and the acting was believable. For a low budget movie, it surpassed many big budget, big name productions"
3,Sad.,"Glen Hansard is a powerful singer songwriter presence. But Marketa brings him to life and gives him wings. So the ending disappoints. The director attests they were going for simplicity in the movie and it shows throughout. Other than Hansard's constant moping about his ex, the only real emotion displayed in this film is in the songs. But they are too born in angst and sadness to be inspiring. I wish we could have seen more character development with these two. I never got the impression Marketa was in love enough with her absent husband to welcome him back. Despite Hansard's alluded success, they both seem so alone at the end of it. Sad."
5,Wonderful film...amazing music!,I finally saw this movie with 2 friends last month after waffling about it for awhile. I'm so glad I did. It's visually intimate -- the camera work makes the environment seem more real. The relationship between Guy & Girl is also wonderful as they don't cross that line that from friends to more -- its not some mushy happily ever after ending in the way most romantic films end.But the best and most important part of all is the music. It's stunning and moving -- I bought the soundtrack immediately after watching the movie and just saw Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova play the Beacon Theatre last night -- its even more amazing live.Highly highly recommend this film and its soundtrack! :)
3,Didn't like the movie as much as I thought I would,"(No spoilers:) Rotten tomatoes gave this movie a great review and said that it was an uplifting romantic comedy/musical, but I disagree. It's got a lot of songs in it, but it's not anywhere near a Rodgers & Hammerstein musical, and it doesn't feel like Broadway. It feels a lot darker and grittier than the reviews led me to expect."
4,So Romantic,"I thought this movie was the perfect blend of romance and reality. Ok, so most people don't break out in song every three minutes but the story was believable. The songs were sung with genuine longing. How do they do that?My husband thought it was ok. He would probably give it a couple stars. He said it was like an un-funny ""Flight of the Conchords"" episode. Ha!"
3,Unusual story,"OnceUnusual but interesting movie. The music and spirit were great, the story line a bit unclear..."
5,Love it!,"Love this movie. Cute story line that doesn't have some fake hollywood taint to it. Not one sex scene. Poor hollywood is shaking it head with it's tried and true methods. However, it still portrays, passion for life, struggle, awkward human emotions, survival, and accomplishment. Last, the end doesn't leave life in a pretty bow tied package. There are still struggles going on through the successes. This felt refreshing.It also feels so honest from a musical perspective because they aren't ""real"" actors. They are ""real"" musicians. It makes the movie more authentic. (I always hate watching an actor pretend to play an instrument with bad technique. It becomes so distracting that I can't even hear the music.) The music written for the movie is nice too!Woo-hoo independent film makers!"
5,"Delightful, Lovely Film with Achingly Beautiful Music","I saw this last weekend. It's a simple story with wonderful chemistry/friendship between the two main characters. The music is really passionate, heartfelt, and it continues throughout the film. I have been blogging about this film, telling everyone I know that they must see it. To see the scenes where these characters are making music together. It's hard to explain just how beautiful it is to watch and to hear. I had the songs in my head the whole night and next day. I ordered the soundtrack right away and downloaded a few from blogs just to last me until the CD arrived. I will buy this film the instant it is released and plan to watch it regularly. If you don't like this film, I have to question your capacity to feel!!"
5,Stuck on the brain -- Once is a *gem*,"I won't make this complicated or pretentious. This is a fantastic movie without a lot of frills or flair. I don't consider this a musical, it's a movie wrapped in touching, heartfelt music and lyrics which will adhere themselves to your soul before you realize it.I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked up this movie, but it definitely left a warm glow behind.Definite 5 stars."
3,ONCE,"Once is an appropriate name for a movie that only inspires the viewer to watch this film ONLY ONCE. I would actually recommend this movie less than Once. And this movie did require 4 attempts by me to sit through this entire movie in ""ONE"" sitting, making ONCE an unmemorable experience. If asked my opinion about ""ONCE"" I would respond by first suggesting other ""B"" movies, or at the very least I would suggest that they not operate any heavy equipment or drive a car if you can avoid those activities after watching this show. I do; however, have the ability to respond to those who might ask, and my answer will be...Yes, I did view this movie ""ONCE"", and I feel I received very little in return.g.bob"
1,preposterously silly,"Sort of kind of inspiring. Sort of. Until you realize that all these two people are doing is churning out a bunch of four-chord songs.Spirited job on the part of the actors, though."
2,How about NEVER,"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is for some of the music. I did enjoy a few of the original songs, but in no way thought they were Oscar worthy. The movie itself is boring and goes absolutely nowhere. I agree with one other review here when the said ""I just didn't get it."" What was the purpose? I kept thinking it was going to get better and then it just ends...sometimes Once it too much."
1,Once dvd,The DVD is defective. Though the movie may have been terrific...I'll never know. I will think twice about buying DVD's on line again.
2,If you like Irish music ...,then you'll like this movie. If you don't then this is a tedious movie with too much music and singing and too little action. I think most kids would find this boring (mine did). I was glad when it ended.
3,Off the Beaten Path - Good Entertainment,The two characters seem to draw you in. There is a bit of good humor and fun interaction. I enjoyed it.
4,Now On Broadway,I bought the movie after seeing the play on Broadway opening night. Neither disappoints. The film won an Oscar. The play is up for numerous Tony Awards.
5,Great Story-Great Music and now a musical on Broadway!,"I rented this because I'd just been to see the musical ""Once"" on Broadway. It's fun to see the original material the show was based on and get more insight into how the story was created. It's hard to believe this isn't a true story--it just FEELS so true. It's a very touching story, very believable. I love the dynamic between the unlikely collaborators in music. It's a simply made movie that will stay with you for a long time. Highly recommended."
3,Couldn't understand the dialogue,"We have someone here from Ireland and she said it was a good movie so I didn't want to give it a poor rating, but I could barely understand anything that was said between the two main characters. After about thirty minutes we gave up on trying to watch it."
4,Movie is a wonderful tale of influencing each other...,"Quality of picture was not always top notch, but that is just a byproduct of the style of the movie and equipment used to shoot it."
5,Must see for those who are musician!!!,I love this movie it was one of the best and rarest movie out there that actually show you what a really good movie one can make. And this is how music should really sound like and be about something that should come from the heart and make you feel in your soul like I said must watch!!!
5,Amazing,"Simply great and for under $10 you can't go wrong. The whole reason I found out about the movie was due to the Pandora website. A lot of songs kept coming up from it, and I loved them all before I finally realized that it was a movie. Watched it tonight, blew me away. A must own."
5,Perfect movie for any day of the year!,"This is, by far, the most uplifting movie I've seen in a really long time. The two characters are depicted as incredibly realistic, yet magical. Perfect friendship/date movie, especially if you are both into ""real"" music. I highly recommend it!"
2,Mistaken,This is not my type of movie. I would say this is for a younger audience and people who enjoy this type of music.
3,A few great songs,"A few great songs, the rest was fair -- the story line was cliche, really better to just listen to the sound track and skip the rest."
3,blu-ray extras are PAL even though the movie is NTSC,Disappointing that the movie plays fine but the extras are not watchable unless your player converts PAL. I don't see where this is called out anywhere in the product description. This is on a Sony BDP-S570
4,"A simple story, very well told, with sublime music","A talented musician in Dublin has let himself go after his girlfriend left him for London. A beautiful Czech girl helps him to reignite his passion for life and music. It's a simple story, but set in a real world where nothing is as simple as it might seem. The music is brilliant (I would compare it to the work of Damien Rice, though I think the voice of the man in this film is even stronger), and pervades the film, making it into something of a musical with lyrics that express indirectly the feelings of the characters and convey details of their pasts and their lives that lends a richness to the simple connection that is obvious between the two characters. The acting is strong, and while the cinematography is not as lush or polished as in more expensive films, it is just right for this story, and puts the emphasis on the characters where it needs to be. A perfect musical romance that avoids cliche and hits all the notes just right."
5,great movie,"I thought this was going to be a bad chick flick, but I enjoyed it. It's the rare type of movie that both my wife and I both enjoyed."
2,More of a Nature movie than a rock climbing movie,The mood was very somber. More of a nature movie than a rock climbing movie. Would liked to have seen more of Ron Kauk. And see him rock climbing and know what he is doing now.
2,Not as good as I'ed hoped,"Although, this item was sent in a timely manner, I was very disappointed. I spent almost $10.00 with postage and the first time I used the ice pick the blade came out of the wooden handle. I ordered this one because it looked like my previous one I had for 20 years which just wore out. It is too much trouble and costly to return it. What a shame!"
3,Won't Work with TomTom One 3rd Edition,"I don't know how well this item works. However, Amazon.com put this in as a recommended purchase when I purchased my TomTom One Third Edition. However, after receiving the GPS and the antenna, I found out you can't use an external antenna with a TomTom One Third Edition.I can't give it a perfect mark because I know nothing about it. I gave it a three star because Amazon.com shouldn't be referring it as a recommended buy"
4,TomTom Antenna Review,"works very well.you are able to get a much better signal,especially in the city where the signal can be weak."
2,This is not the traffic/weather antenna.,"I returned this because I thought it was the traffic/weather antenna. It's not. This antenna just gets you a better signal, which you don't even really need."
5,RIP YOUR HEART OUT,"Ian Wright takes you on this journey to Cambodia (I saw this on PBS). This is not your usual Ian being a goofball.In this installment he talks with survivors of the Khmer Rouge's prison. One well-known prisoner Vann Nath is interviewed (whose skills as a painter kept him alive). One of seven survivors of Cambodia's Tuol Sleng torture chambers, and escaped when Pol Pot's ""killing fields"" regime suddenly collapsed in 1979. He painted graphic pictures of communist Khmer Rouge extracting ""confessions"" from victims.Some of his paintings depicting the atrocities he witnessed while he was held captive are shown. GUT WRENCHING!!!"
4,entertaining and full of information,"Worth owning, I purchased it for a upcoming trip. A little more information on problems to watch out for and how to move around the country would be nice"
3,Older woman tries to deal with relationship with younger man,"A typical movie about a older woman trying to deal with her relationship with younger man. She loves him when they are alone, but is embarrassed about him in public. Finally she figures out that she really loves him and the age difference is no big deal to her and to heck to what other people think. Good for her!!"
4,Excelente trabajo,"Despues de un disco en directo que dejo mucho que desear -a mi parecer- Bersuit regresa con otro de estudio que no defrauda. Las letras como siempre cargadas con polvora ironica y polemica para destruir la fachada politica y socioeconomica de su querido pais y algunos otros paises de America Latina. Musicalmente sigue mas o menos la misma linea de sus discos anteriores, pero sin llegar a repetir formulas y manteniendo el sonido aun fresco.La razon por la que le he dado 4 y no 5 estrellas es porque me parece que hay dos canciones que sobran o que almenos podrian haber sido trabajadas un poco mas. No dire cuales son y los dejare jusgar.Con un poco de tiempo creo que este disco puede llegara destronar a ""Libertinaje"" como la mejor obra de La Bersuit."
1,Black Dried Seaweed,"I followed the directions, and the black burnt like crips multiplied within a few minutes. I was under the impression that seaweed was green. It appeared as if I was about to prepare a brew of tea. I do not recommend this product. Buy the stuff in the store, and actually review the expiration date. Totally grossed out all the people in my office. I initally wanted to add the seaweed to my miso soup."
5,Wonderful Wallander 2,"Here is what I wrote for other films in this series; it holds true for these too.I love the author Henning Mankell and very much enjoyed Kenneth Branaugh's film versions of some of Mankell's mysteries. Just recently, I obtained these Swedish films of Mankell stories. I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys well done mysteries and who does not have a thing about subtitles."
3,Bad printed volume,Book had sme plusses but the volume I got was returned because some pages were miscut and printed upside down
1,"Utterly Frustrating, Completely Useless",Why did the New Yorker cripple this collection? The copy protection renders it completely useless. The DJVU files should have been perfectly portable. And who could sign off on the spyware clause in the user agreement? Such a disappointment.
1,"Content is fine, but New Yorker viewer is buggy","The New Yorker viewer is a buggy mess, which is a shame, because when you're lucky enough to be able to view the DVD's, they contain a lot of great stuff. But the viewer regularly freezes the computer, fails to display content because of ""invalid frames"", and chops off the left side of the display. Life is too short."
2,Search function impossible,"I am a faithful New Yorker Magazine subscriber and jumped at the chance to have the complete archive available on CD. Here's the problem that others may be able to help me with. Am I a complete dunce or is the Search function totally impossible? The Help page does not help.I have been trying to find an article (year I can't recall) about domestic violence which told about how worthless protection orders are, that they are only good for ""where to find the body."" Protection orders don't protect someone. They won't stop someone from doing violence. In my search I've tried domestic violence, protection order, law enforcement, even where to find the body.Is there some secret or basics that I've been unable to grasp? What a great concept to have a complete archive or The New Yorker. What a BIG disappointment that you can't find anything. Water water every where, but not a drop...."
5,20th century in a box!,Name a subject and the Complete New Yorker addresses it ...and probably from many perspectives and in every decade! This collection is a goldmine of research and personal library of literature.
2,"such great idea, such a waste","I was so happy to get this as a x-mas present. However, the designers of the search functions of this product must be a bunch of imbecils; it is so frustrating to search through categories and access to articles. The search operations are clunky and often plain wrong. For example, a search on all PROFILES written by Janet FLANNER gives only one article.. A damm foolish result and I have no idea how to correct it. NewYorker HAS TO improve this product before it should be recommended to anyone. What a waste, what a sad waste."
4,Corrections to other reviews,"It makes it clear that it's not actually PDFs, it's ""protected DjVu."" uh-oh! they could get the same compression factor, without all the complications and pain, from using JPEG-2000 compression with PDFs. Or, better yet, just use ""normal"" compression and sacrifice a little zoomability for usability, until computers catch up.right now it sounds like it's way too slow for anyone who hasn't just paid money for it to love. (look out for those post-Christmas reviews!) you can resize the views, though."
1,Unable to play on my Dell at home or work,"I returned one set of the DVDs and ordered a second but wasunable to play either on my computers. The drive kept tellingme to install the disk which was in the drive. Unfortunately,there is not a troubleshooting guide or advice so I reluctantlyreturned the second set. I did make sure other discs would playon my computers. I have to assume there was a defect in the discs I received. Very disappointing."
5,Content by far outweighs defects in form,"I agree with all the defects in the form found by the previous reviewers, and I hope they would be corrected in the future, but the content is so good, and there is so much of it (you'll never read it all in your lifetime), that I am very happy I have The Complete New Yorker. I never imagined I would have in my home so much high-quality material to read. Add to that the little space it occupies and that it costs only $61.11, and I think it is the best purchase I have made in my life. Yes, it could have not all those defects and be perfect, but what is perfect in this world? P.D. Contrary to what yo may think, I have no connection with the editors, amazon, etc."
1,This thing sucks,I was really looking forward to this. MAJOR disappointment. Copy-protected crap: won't install properly. Don't waste your money. Zero stars is more like it.
5,"If you like the New Yorker, I'd get the dvds but don't buy the hard drive!","I bought the dvds over a year ago without any problems. My only complaint is having to swap out the discs. When they announced a hard drive with all the issues up to April 2006, I jumped on it and pre-ordered.I sincerely regret it. The hard drive doesn't work. I'm out $240 (they gave me a $60 discount because I own the dvds). And because I got my name engraved on the back (it was a free service) not only can I not get a refund, but they won't even let me exchange it!I'm very disappointed in The New Yorker. I will never purchase anything from them again."
4,HOW TO RUN THE DVDs ON YOUR COMPUTER,"1. Place disc in tray and run.2. Left click START3. Left click MY COMPUTER4. Right click New Yorker disc logo5. Left click OPEN6. Depending if you have Mac or Microsoft, right click on corresponding icon.7. Left click on OPEN.This will start the software program."
1,Rip Off,Beware: This software will not install on Mac System. Good luck with getting help. Good luck with getting a refund.
4,"It's great, but already an artifact","I've had this edition of The New Yorker for years and have enjoyed the accessibility of the articles. However, every current subscriber now has free access to the same archive of articles online and it's much faster to get the stuff you want off of their website.Still, it's a mighty nice collection and a handsome addition to anyone's library, and the price is dirt cheap (this started out originally as a $100 product). So, you now have a choice in retrieving a treasure trove of great writing."
3,"Great, but now useless","Gave to hubbo as a gift a couple years ago. He thought it was great, though he never really used it that much. But now that the New Yorker offers online access to its archives to subscribers--which includes the two years of issues since we got this product--there's really not much need to ever crack the box open. If you aren't a subscriber or you run a library, guess this would still be a good deal."
1,"do yourself a favor, do NOT buy this","I'm an avid New Yorker reader, for over 10 years. I was really excited when the DVD set came out, ordered it right away and boy wasn't I in for a rude awakening. The interface is really hard to figure out, each article takes an eon to load, and don't bother with the search function, it just doesn't work. The bug-infested, awkwardly designed original DVD set got unanimous bad reviews, just do a search.Against my best judgement, I bought the v1.3 update disk this year hoping for a redemption. It arrived after a MONTH I ordered it, and it simply WON'T install. I'm no computer genius but I'll say I'm reasonably tech savvy, but I just simply can't get the installation to work. It'll stuck at 100% and freeze the whole system. I emailed, called the tech support, NO response. This is basically just a text viewer, i don't know why it's so damn hard to make it work."
1,DVDs would not run and there is no real customer support.,After purchasing The Complete New Yorker with great anticipation I spent about 4 hours trying to get my computer to accept the fact that there was indeed a DVD in the slot. I never succeeded none of the disks would run. Their idea of 24-hour customer support is simply email support and I received no response by email at all to my questions. I have returned the unit for a refund.
2,"Great Content, Terrible Quality Testing","In addition to poor abstract writing, multiple issues are missing from this ""complete"" dvd:SpecificallySept. 6, 1947Feb. 20, 1989April 3, 1989July 3, 1989Aug. 14, 1989Aug. 28, 1989Oct. 9, 1989Oct. 16, 1989Nov. 27, 1989Also the search engine is badly designed and crashes when one tries to search for ""O'"" names such as ""O'Reilly"""
1,I couldn't even get the d****d thing to start!,"I bought a used copy. The seller described the discs as having ""slight wear."" I detect no ""wear"" at all on the discs. Nevertheless, my computer can't even detect disc 1 when I insert it. I'm now emailing the seller to get a refund. I don't think I'll try another copy. NEW YORKER: IMPROVE THIS PRODUCT!"
3,cd,"I'm usually very please with your products, but this time, the cd that you send me is a little noisy. But, I guess that is my fault because it is a used product, so I took my chances."
4,"Great music, even if you didn't see the movie.",A very nice piece (liked the movie as well) It is a constant player for both me & my wife. Makes you relax while working at the computer all day too. Looking forward to other work by this atrist...
4,An underrated Goldsmith score,"Another heavily synthesized Goldsmith score, but, like ""Legend,"" works to capture an atmosphere lush with natural mystery. The orchestrations are mostly dulcet and easygoing, and the melodies follow beautifully. One theme in particular is unmistakably Barry-like... Here is an underrated score (for an underrated movie). And it is a Jerry Goldsmith/Varese Sarabande album with over 30 minutes of music - a rarity, that!"
5,Off the top and over the top too,"This CD is a favorite, as is the movie.I love the theme, and the movie was so inspiring that we actually went to Brazil."
4,Boston Strangler,"I thought it was very good for the year that it was produced. Tony curtis played the derranged strangler very well, one of his best performances."
3,The Boston Strangler,It was a three star for today's youth mainly but still who shot the kennedy man. I think that the little off stangler was magnificent. And today he should be giving another look of apprieciation. Good luck hoodie Curtis. May the world be with you is the light and in the knight. Tony is joey and joey is Tony!
4,One of Tony Curtis better films,I thought for the times that it was made in that this is one of the better Crime Movies. It was a real ground breaker in dealing with sexual deviantancy and the Monster that was the Boston Strangler. A good solid effort that looks back to the dawn of our current sad state of society.
3,Probably Fiction,"This movie, which purports to be factual, although it is well made & acted is apparently partly fiction. It is indisputedly true 13 women were murdered in the Boston area. It is not known apparently for sure whether it was the work of only one person or several. ""The movie was highly fictionalized: It assumed DeSalvo was guilty, and it portrayed him as suffering from multiple personality disorder and committing the murders while in a psychotic state. DeSalvo was never diagnosed with, or even suspected of having, that disorder."" (From Wikipedia)"
3,Never Confuse It With the Real Story,"I saw this movie when it first opened in New England. I read the book ""The Boston Strangler"" by Gerold Frank. Then I read the book ""The Boston Stranglers"" by Susan Kelly.The movie is a classic, odd in its production and worth adding to my DVD collection. BUT, the film is pure fiction, taken from Frank's book which is nearly all fiction.Read Kelly's book and afterward I am sure you will agree with the police. Albert DeSalvo had nothing to do with the eleven, mostly unrelated, murders."
3,Ahead of its time,"With its split screen camera work - preceding, but like the movie ""Woodstock"" from the same era - this film seems a little ahead of its time. As a thriller, though, it's pretty wooden. It's not scary in the least, compared with today's films. The acting is leaden, at best. Tony Curtis has one facial expression: blank. The other big names, Henry Fonda, George Kennedy seem fairly lame actors by today's standards of DeNiro, Pacino etc. Also, it was not snowy in Boston the weekend of the Kennedy assassination, as this film erroneously depicts. That should have been elementary research. I don't know how accurate the film is. As a period piece, watch it if you like dated older movies."
3,"Better than ""Independent""","""MASTER SEVEN"" (1997) is quite a dark album in the same style as ""INDEPENDENT"" (2002) but the difference is that ""MASTER SEVEN"" actually includes a couple of melodic as well as faster songs (""Bad I am"", ""Slow down"", ""Get up my friend"", and ""Roses"") which makes this one a better buy. Lenny Wolf has a very personal voice with more than a touch of a moaning streak, and in the long run I think it's just too much. Kingdom Come is a band that is best in small doses, and all the talk about how similar Kingdom Come are to Led Zeppelin is just not true."
3,Good overview but leave many questions open,"This book is a good read and interesting for people who want to get a good overview on the topic and are interested in history. The author sticks to the facts and let Lawrence speak through his letters. This, however, lets many questions of his character open. The author avoids getting deeper into his personality and for those who are interested in the psychology of his character will be a littlebit disappointed. The author does not (like one of the reviewers says) clearifies whether he was homosexual or not, nor does he discusses deeply his relationsship his parents and so on. The book is complementary to the film which makes a better statement about his personality and after reading this book I even more impressed about the film."
1,defective switch,it did not work. Defective. I installed it and it did not work. It did not work. It did not work.
4,very cute hat!!!,I love this soft knit hat it goes great with my blue and brown toggle wool coat.. this will keep my head warm in the cold winter of Chicago while allowing my head breath a little.
1,Pot,Deceptive! The plant was not shipped in a pot. It is a plastic container. Needed to transplant to as soon as possible. Recommend to change the description from pot to plastic containers.
5,beautiful plant,Beautiful healthy plant great packing and very fast shipping. I was very pleased with my order. Hope it blooms soon.
5,Excellent quality plant!,"I just received my Good hope Clivia, today. I'm very pleased with the quality of the plant itself, and the care that went into preparing it for shipping. Every leaf is healthy and green. It was well protected for shipment,wrapped in protective paper and nestled in packing peanuts, I'm impressed. This one is a Christmas present, I think I'll be ordering one for myself,as well."
5,"Perfect packaging, fine plant, really good customer relations",I received a great plant with five leaves and a sixth peeking out packed perfectly. There appeared another plant the next day. Customer service was delightful. I expect great things from my Good Hope Clivia.
5,Good Hope Yellow clivia,"I am absolutely thrilled with the Good Hope clivia you sent me. It arrived in perfect shape, far bigger than I could have hoped for and at a better price than one would have paid for seeds. I will definitely be looking through your store to see if there is anything else I can't live without. I gave away about 225 of my 250 various plants because my back can't handle the seasonal indoor/outdoor migration that is necessary to do in MN. I have wanted a yellow clivia for some time but the prices were more than I could justify. Based on what I know this plant, it might well bloom next year. You have no idea how thrilled and surprised I was to get such a lovely healthy plant, far larger than I expected, obviously healthy more than a week earlier than I expected it and for a price that no one could beat. Thank you, thank you, thank you!Peggy EichenlaubBurnsville, MN"
3,Pegs Plastic Document Boxes,"These are very bright and happy boxes. I'm returning them for they do not seem to be tough or strong enough for my needs. I did not realizethat they were more for light use. I need something a little more sturdy. Otherwise, a great product for the proper use."
1,They don't make them any flimsier than these,"Files are delivered flat and are assembled by folding the plastic. There is no reinforcement along the seams or along the base, therefore you can immediately see that they do not hold their shape at all and require being stuffed full of sturdy magazines in order to remain upright. I am not sure what these magazine holders are intended to do... but you can't hold magazines in them and expect them to stay upright unless the following conditions are met:a) they are completely full of very sturdy and squared off magazines, and/or...b) they are stabilized by holders, books or what have you on either sideFor my purpose, which is to actually hold magazines and expect the file to remain upright without supports, they are utterly inadequate."
1,Lacking Quality,You get what you pay for. The bottoms fall out and can't support the weight of a few magazines.
1,Flimsy and ugly,The picture makes the boxes look atrractive and doesn't show the tabs that stick out. The plastic is very thin and cheap-looking. They look like they'd fall apart very easily. I ordered these based on the one review here but I really hate them and wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
3,the image is kind of misleading,I meant to buy some boxes made with hard thick plastic.It is actually made by collapsible plastic of about 0.5mm(thick).
4,Good product,Arrived on time. Good size and quality for sorting my genealogical material. Easy to use. They will help me get organized.
1,dissatisfied-no where on the description page did it mention the boxes had to be constructed,It wasn't mentioned in any of the descriptions that these boxes had to be constructed. When constructed the sides bow out. They are useless for photo storage. I am too disgusted even to return them. I will leave them flat and use them as a desk protector for paint splats.
3,Decent but flimsy,"These boxes are nice but they are pretty flimsy. I use them to store craft supplies, office supplies, and other ""junk."" Next time I'll spend a little more for a traditional photo box made of sturdy cardboard to suit my needs."
3,Magazine storage,Loved the colors. They are a little bit flimsy and fall over and stretch. Would like to have them in a heavier material.
3,Flimsy boxes,"These are made of thin highly bendable plastic, and are adequate for papers, nothing heavier as they cannot support any weight inside."
1,not so good,"I got a set of these boxes, they are a good size, but they fall apart when filled with anything. I dont recommend this product at all.the cap doesnt even stay on, they're plastic, and they loose their shape."
4,Decorative,"I was searching for some colorful boxes to go in my open home office shelves to organize papers, etc. These are very lightweight and very colorful. When I first got them they appeared to be flimsy and it took a little while to figure out how to put them together easily. I did not think they would be very durable. However, this is the second set I have bought! I bought one set about a year ago and have had no problem with durability. They have all held up remarkably well. Great little organizers. They stack in my shelves very easily and fit nicely in the shelves. And what I like most is the color they add to the room. They are sturdier than they first appear - especially once you put ""stuff"" in them. And I especially love the price. At this price I could afford to organize a larger section of my shelves than I could have with other storage containers. I would purchase more - if I needed them."
4,CD cases,"When they first arrived I thought I had a ""pig in the polk"" as they appeared flimsy. But I put them together, with some difficulty, and found them to be quite adequate."
1,did not hold up to the job,I bought them to save magazines for knitting. The boxes are difficult to put together and fall apart after being used.
4,Great for the price!,Took a bit of time to assemble but for the price these are great! I am using them to store photos in!So excited to get organized!
5,In LOVE with this book,"I wish this book was longer, that is how much I love it. It helped me begin to organize my thoughts and notes. The case studies of movies were extremely helpful. I have them tagged so I can easily flip to them as a reference. Actually the book looks like it exploded pink Post-It notes because that is how many gems I found inside.The romantic comedy is suffering and I hope more people who want to write in that genre read this book so we can all benefit from better screenplays."
3,Just for collections sake.,"I have an open Rodimus Prime and a boxed one now. I just ordered another Rodimus Prime to keep in the box. I usually don't collect for value sake, but (...)you can't beat this deal. You can find Rodimus Primes online for double or triple that easily (and yes I am talking about this reissue version). I am very happy with my recent Amazon purchases. Lower prices is one of the things I look for. I highly recommend buying this while the price is low and the toy is available."
4,I just figured it out!,"It's a slot machine! He looks like a freaking Las Vegas style slot machine! He's cool even though everytime I look at him now I feel like he should be spitting out quarters. It's Rodimus, he's cool no matter what."
2,Rodimus Prime - stiff as a board,"I bought Rodimus Prime back in 1987 and I was disappointed. Although he looks OK with flames and bright colours, he is too small compared to G1 Galvatron. How is he supposed to fight a super-powered maniac when he is less than half the size? Furthermore, his articulation is limited to swinging his arms at the shoulders and nodding his head. His trailer is like Optimus's trailer after it's been chopped up and rebuilt smaller. Sure, there are some big guns inside but they don't seem that special. There are some shields on the sides of the trailer guns, which only look strong enough to stop a low-powered medical laser. Rodimus also carries a long rifle, which is like his old Hot Rod guns but stretched. I think that, overall, he is not a worth successor to the Optimus Prime toy or even the brick-like Ultra Magnus toy. I'm very reluctant to buy the reissue, even if it has metal feet!"
3,sgtjdog,"The rodimus prime toy is kind of cool when in car mode. However dont change it to robot mode. It is absolutely disgusting. Whoever did this to the legacy of the transformers should be shot! NO movement in robot mode, and a serious dullness make this toy a pos. Even the picture on the box is poorly done. Save your money and buy dirge."
2,This is not for kids - collectors only,"My 6 year old really wanted this for Christmas. We didn't know that the G1's are Generation One. That means they are the very first original transformers. Great for a collector, but not for kids. The G1's don't even come close to measuring up to the new transformers. They are very generic & you even have to put the decals on them.Very overpriced & NOT for kids!"
1,Not really sure what this is for??,"This product is not what I expected. I guess it's made to protect your hard drive when you aren't using it, but when would I not use my hard drive?!"
1,Flimsy hard drive enclosure,It's a crummy product that should be sold through the local 99 cents store. The product is made of cheap plastic material. It should be worth not more than 99 cents.
2,Not as advertised but ...,"There are a ton of fake USB drives out there. This is not a fake, but it's also not a U3 device. Memorex makes two versions (not interchangeable) that look very similar. The U3 version is 32509383 this one is 32509389. This drive is incredibly SLOW as well! Think of it as a big floppy.U3 is an incredibly useful feature with a little research you can install entire applications and then run them from another PC without installing anything on the 2nd PC. Great tool for techs!I'm returning this device for the reasons stated. I'll consider this event an honest mistake by the seller (provided I get a refund without problems) I bought a U3 elsewhere already and chose a SanDisk because of the speed problem.I may comment more on the return if there are any problems!"
5,"Marvelous and unique, but almost unknown","My wife introduced me to this recording in the early 80s. As a singer and songwriter Linda Lewis was exceptional, although some lyrics now sound a bit dated-naively psychadelic and clearly pre-feminist. But she was a brilliant talent with an uplifting spirituality. Does anyone know what became of her?"
5,READ THIS BOOK !!!,"If you only read one book in your lifetime, read this book. I have shared several copies of this book with friends and strangers over the years and I hope to aquire another case of them to continue the magic."
5,The Seed of Greatness is within,"I was given this book by W.Clement Stone and it is a touchstone of success. I have two copies, a 1968 and 1981 editions. The 1981 has a great list of other great books one must try to own"
5,¡LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR!,"¡FANTÀSTICO ! Cuando me casè y mamà me regal ""que hago hoy de comer?"" lo vi con cierto desprecio: Estaba tan enamorada que ¿como no me iba a inspirar de què hacerle de comer a mi esposo? Pues ¡sorpresa! porque para la octava semana mi mente estaba en blanco... hasta que me acordè del regalo de mami. Me ahorrò trabajo a lo loco,porque trae hasta la lista del super;Y tiene muchas, muchas recetas como para que pasen años antes que repita uno un platillo... Desde entonces, mi amorcito y yo comemos ¡de lujo!"
5,great follow up!,"This is another stong work by Jonatha Brooke in a series of incredible solo albums. First class! ""Linger"" is a wonderful pop song & many of the new tracks seem to reflect a changing sensibility from the harmony-driven songs with The Story oeriod if her career. While this may disappoint some, her maturation as an artist is very exciting to me."
5,Add This CD To The Soundtrack of Your Life!,"Jonatha Brooke just gets better and better. As a fan since The Angel In The House was released in the early 90s, I am constantly floored by each new work Jonatha comes out with. This CD is addictive and compulsively listenable. Jonatha is one of the rare artists who creates her own unique musical style, yet continually expands it without ever making a wrong move. If you're looking for the perfect CD to add to the soundtrack of your life, this is it! (And check out her other CD's too)."
4,My vote for worst album cover paired with the best music,"What's up with that horrible picture of the lovely and immensely talented Jonatha Brooke on the cover of this compelling, well-produced disk? Sure, if you've heard 10 Cent Wings and Plumb, this is well-trodden territory...she has a signature sound and delivery that's consistent across these efforts. This disk is less astringent, though, compared to 10 Cent Wings. Of course I miss the beautiful, soaring and introspective singing on Angel in the House...but that's a special five-star+ duet effort. Not quite folk, not exactly rock (though often leaning that way), Jonatha paints beautiful guitar/vocals-centric singing pictures of relationship perspectives (not all are happy times...after all this is Jonatha Brooke). One could complain that this disk borrows/recycles too much from previous efforts...luckily for us, that path has many rewards for her fans."
3,Maddeningly uneven,"This record is a sonic departure from anything Jonatha's done; however, it shares with ""Plumb"" and ""10 Cent Wings"" a maddening inconsistency. ""New Dress"" is brilliant, ""Linger"" and ""How Deep is Your Love"" are quite good, but several tracks didn't hold my interest on the first or tenth listen. ""I'll Take it from Here"", which Jonatha wrote for TV's Felicity, is especially puffball.The record is, as usual, brilliantly produced. However, the more distortion-filled, grittier sounds sometimes cover Jonatha's voice. There is no question that Jonatha is an excellent songwriter and beautiful singer, but I agree with the reviewers that the record is not her finished product, but more searching."
3,Which Jonatha Brooke do you like?,"If you like the Jonatha Brooke who writes wistful tunes that are arranged with unexpected harmony that coats your ears like honey, then this CD will be a disappointment for you. If you like the Jonatha Brooke who rocks the house and wants to make the college radio charts, then you must own this. I prefer the former, so this CD left me a little unhappy. It has moments that recall her days in the Story, but they are few and far between. Don't get me wrong; this CD is great for what it is: a pseudo-alternative GRRL CD. It's like Jonatha is channeling Ani DiFranco. Overall the production is first-rate and given the right mood it would burn the house down. Just not the right CD for a quiet reflective mood."
3,I'm Inconsolable.,"Alain is gone, Ingrid is gone, Jennifer is long gone. Also missing are the haunting melodies and poignant lyrics I've come to love in Jonatha Brooke's music. If you've heard Jonatha's story about the French DJ who played ""Inconsolable"" 30 times in a row, you know there's nothing on this CD to touch her previous work. The first time I listened to ""The Angel in the House"" CD, I curled up on the floor next to the stereo and cried because it was so beautiful. Jonatha Brooke makes incredible music and she's as equally gifted a live performer as on CD. There's a delicious surprise in her vocal arrangements; her lyrics are clever and unexpected. I was awed by ""Plumb."" But ""Steady Pull"" is a disappointment - just another trinket on her bracelet."
3,Not really East Coast,I bought the music to teach by. It's too fast for East Coast Swing (triple time swing). It may be OK for jive. The title is misleading. Otherwise the music is fine.
3,Barely okay for practice,"Dance Mania relies heavily on a synthesizer. This East Coast swing disc is not the worst of the four I listened to. There is little pop and sizzle here. I would not want to listen to it again. It does not make me want to swing.WinRon Productions provides a lot of music for Dance Vision International. These music cds are available with an instructional DVD. If you want the music, buy it in the DVD / CD package instead. Dance Vision's dance instruction is excellent, and it saddens me to see them cheapen their label by releasing these mediocre cds apart from the DVDs.Title, duration, downbeats per minute for each swing:Whole lotta fun, 1:49, 43 bpmKnocknock, 2:23, 43 bpmAll night party, 1:51, 43 bpmRock touch, 2:32, 43 bpmMama was a jive queen, 2:48, 43 bpmBanana split, 2:29, 43 bpm5 o'clock jive, 2:23, 43 bpmJump, jump boogie, 2:29, 43 bpmWhite lightnin', 1:54, 44 bpmHip hop jive, 2:08, 44 bpm"
2,Offers nice suggestions for various wedding crafts.,"The book has some neat and wonderful creations but deals primarily with silk flowers for the crafts and it doesn't fully offer explanations or detailed instructions on some of the crafts. Most arrangements or crafts are primarily traditional older ideas, nothing with a contemporary touch for the 90's."
5,Great read for girls that love horses,"Three girls, Stevie, Lisa and Carole, form ""the Saddle Club"" the name they give themselves because they are all horse crazy and really good friends.They are chosen by their trainer to enter a horse show, and told to set themselves goals for the show. Of course, they all have their hearts set on winning the blue ribbon (a first place) in each section of the competition. Lisa rides a beautiful horse, Prancer, but he isn't really ready for competitions just yet. Carole just wants to beat Cam Nelson, someone she has met on an internet bulletin board, whom Carole thinks is just too big for her own boots. Stevie wants to win -everything.The nice thing about this book is that each girl learns a lot from competing, and realises that what she thought was important is a side issue in a competition -the main thing is having fun.An enjoyable read, nice solid morals and highly recommended for girls aged 9-14."
2,"Not a Real ""A"" Show","That is not how a real ""A"" show is. They don't have trail classes! They have four over fences and a flat. or in equitation they have two over fences and a flat. They give champions by divisions not the whole show. Carole didn't even get that many points."
1,Big difference between an idea that sounds good,"and a good ""sound"" idea.A book built on platitudes not repeatable results."
1,"Wrong Supplier, Wrong Book, No Service","Book_Dragon, the supplier's name is appropriate. Beware of Dragons. Over two weeks ago, received a silly cook book versus a serious expedited text for a term paper. Everyone makes mistakes, but what is unacceptable is the lack of response from the supplier or Amazon who represents this supplier. I followed the ""returns"" process on-line at Amazon. No response from anyone on where to return book, no refund, no correct book (it is too late, paper's complete). There is a broken link in chain, until it is addressed I will not order books from a supplier for more than a few dollars. It is not worth the hassle, especially if you really need the book."
4,One song missing?,I bought this CD and saw that the song One And Only is missing. I down loaded it from the net and burned it off on a disc and then burned the Doc Hollywood soundtrack on there too. It's a great CD now!
2,DVD Battery,"The seller claim the battery is brand new, when it arrived it looked used and without a box."
2,May have just been this watch,"Unfortunately when I received this watch there were dozens of tiny scratches (1mm or so) in every direction across the watch face. The watch was 'new' had had all accompanying materials including an intact plastic covering over the watch face (the scratches were on the crystal) so I am not sure exactly what the issue was. Also, the watch looks very plain (i.e. not modern, just dull and boring). The picture is not completely accurate in this respect.I will say that I purchased it through watchzone, and after a few minor hiccups they refunded the full amount of the watch and paid for return shipping - very hassle free.In conclusion, it may have jsut been this particular watch, but the condition of it was completely unsatisfactory"
5,An Oldie But Goodie,"This is an older book, but still has very good photo documentation of MANY weapons & gear of the Revolution. Text also explains a lot. Not an exhaustive academic book, but very nicely done for the rest of us."
3,so so,when i first got it out of the box it didn't really work. suspecting a weak battery i replaced the battery and it worked slightly better. It seems to work ok but the screen sometimes looks funny (like all 7s instead of 0s). it works. it doesn't look like it's too durable so if you're looking for something you can keep for a while and/or use a lot i'd say spend a little more and get something else. some minimal use this is probably ok.
4,Too much jungle drums to thoroughly enjoy,"If you want the real thing as in ""Predator"" then you will enjoy this CD very much...I am waiting to see the release of the 1st movie's score but until then this is definetely something to listen to if you are a Silvestri fan"
2,Goro Hasegawa was the Japanese re-discoverer of Othello,"Goro Hasegawa was the Japanese rediscoverer of Othello. Originally, the game was known as Reversi. Two rival Englishmen each claimed to have invented the game late 19th century. Hasegawa modified the rules slightly and his father, a Shakespearean scholar game it the name Othello, because the reversals in the game reminded him of the plot of the play. This book is the only widely distributed manual of Othello strategy. Although it may have some value for the collector, unfortunately most Othello players regard the strategies discussed in the book as being obsolete and even misleading. Readers who are interested in the game should look for resources on the Internet."
1,Beginners would do well to avoid it...,"Othello, devised by Hasegawa-san in the 1970s, is an improved version of the century-old English game, reversi. [What is called reversi on-line is almost always Othello rather than reversi].This book was written soon after Othello was devised, before anyone understood much about the game. Unfortunately it shows, and beginners would do well to avoid it - at least as a source of ideas on strategy and tactics - because it will lead them down a deceptively appealing blind alley.Because of its many diagrams, however, it may be of use to those who know enough to recognise where it goes wrong but otherwise I recommend it for historical interest only.Better resources can be found free on the Web, in the form of strategy guides, illustrative applets and programs that can beat even the best humans. A printed alternative is Othello: Brief & Basic by Ted Landau, which is old but still excellent (as far as it goes)."
4,Blindsighted,Good book! I am about halfway through. Karin Slaughter's style of writing keeps you interested. I recommend this book and will buy more of her books in the future.
2,Blindsighted,"Ok, not a page turner. Not blindsighted at all by this book. Wish I had bought it for fifty cents at Goodwill, then it would have been worth the money. I am hard to please, so if you like books that are a fast easy to forget book, then you might enjoy it. Land fill. Glad it was a Kendal book.LOL"
2,A rough start for a first novel,"Okay, it was her first novel. But the dialogue is clunky, the characters are stiff, and the various plots are too conveniently tied together. She also has the wacky family ala Evanovich-light. I'll give her another go, but let's hope she's not a Kellerman"
4,"Gory, but good","For her debut novel, Karin Slaughter has produced an excellent mystery, featuring an interesting story, good suspense, and gore galore. The two main characters are both interesting: a female pediatrician (who also serves as the town's coroner) and her ex-husband, the Chief of Police. (Less interesting is a thirld character, a police detective, who features prominently in parts of the story.)The case is a tough one: someone in their small Georgia town is committing a series of horrible assaults on women. At times the story is more graphic than is good for the digestion, but it is effective. Slaughter is definitely off to a fast start. I think fans (and ex-fans) of Patricia Cornwell will like this one.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink"
3,3.5 stars,"Even though I picked out the killer before it was shown to the readers I still thought this book was good. It had to be, because half of me wanted to stop reading it and the other half couldn't let it go. I took an early lunch today so I could finish it. After finishing the book I felt as if something had been missing in it, but I can't figure out what it was. I would recommend this author, but I don't consider Blindsighted a keeper."
3,Likeable debut despite the gore,"You rather expect that a ME-centered mystery is going to be violent, and Slaughter doesn't confound those expectations. It suffers a bit from the recent trend of making every book more bloody, more twisted, and more violent than the last. Pretty much every shocking aspect you could hope to see is seen, and the reader should beware that the violence (including sexual violence) is quite graphic.Given all that, it's a commendation that I was as interested in the book as I was. It doesn't get bogged down by all the shockadelic plot points, and Sara Linton emerges from all the blood as a robust and well-drawn character.I'll be interested to read the next book in the series-- I have some hope that Slaughter may still follow a more psychologically thrilling path."
4,Vivid and terrifying.....,"Karin Slaughter thrusts the reader into her story from the very beginning!! Her writing comes at you fast and hard and you are propelled into the world of Sara Linton, a pediatrician and also the town coroner.When Sara discovers a college professor in a diner who has been brutally raped and mutilated, moments from death, the horrifying story begins. Is this a random act, will there be others and who can be behind the cold, precise tortuous murder? Sara must deal with the facts in her job as coroner and the feeling that somehow it is her responsibility to find the missing fragments to a perplexing, horrendous murder.Events from Sara's past surface, affecting the way she looks at everything in her life and coloring her perspective.This is a compelling, fast paced, psychological thriller that is both vivid and terrifying."
5,No Doze says BUY THE BOOK!!!,"Without getting too wordy let me say this: Who's Partricia Cornwell???Karin Slaughter's first book proves she owns this part of the genre. Her characters are amazingly real. She rights like and old pro. I was up all night so I could find out what was happening! When I finished, I had to go on line to see how long I'd have to wait for the next book.I highly recommend this book. Get used to this name!!! Karin Slaughter is going to leave her mark!"
3,Not so blindsighted,I found the solution was easily seen. I am willing to give the author another try before my final decision about reading Karin Slaughter again
1,Pure Trash,"If you enjoy books where every female character is raped (brutally and horrifically) and the reader is told what makes the crime worse is THEY ENJOYED IT, then this is a book for you. Victims are nailed to the floor (yes, nails through hands and feet) and ""made love to."" The rapist is obvious from the very beginning and the entire book just fails on every level. I cannot believe the high rating for this complete piece of garbage.Because of the high ratings for this series I decided to give this horrible author another chance and started the second book in the Grant County series. If the first rape-fest book in the series wasn't enough, the characters relive the horror of the first book endlessly. Page after page of a woman reliving the horrific rape from the first book, and saying she is dead because the worst thing was she enjoyed it. This author is looking for an excuse to publish rape pornography and this series seems to fit the genre perfectly."
4,Great Book & highly recommend,"I love mysteries & would recommend this book to all who also love reading mysteries as I do., Gruesome details at times!"
3,Enjoyable Read...,...even though I figured out whodunnit very early on. Engaging characters. I was equally interested in the love story as I was the mystery. This was the first book I read by this author and I immediately bought the next two books in the series.
2,Bindsighted,"Painfully predictable, there is nothing original here. The surprise identity of the killer is no surprise as its fairly obvious from the moment they appear that they're the killer. Character wise, these people are really difficult to warm to. Everyone is so angsty and shouty, the relationship between Linton and her ex grated. Are we supposed to root for them to get back together? They're just idiots and the conversations between them never ring true. Slaughter has some decent ideas but desperately needs a decent editor to sort them out."
3,Indescribable,"Does anyone write about male coroners? Having followed Kay Scarpetta's career here is yet another female coroner up to her elbows in corpses. There were some inconsistencies in this book revealed as the story unfolds. A point I would like explained is how the victim of the rape 12 years ago became pregnant when the testimony revealed that the rapist couldn't ejaculate during the rape and had to masturbate to a climax, spurting the semen on the victems chest and face. Hmmmm And the reason for the shotgun blast to Jeffery was never satisfactorily explained and he was the chief in charge of the police department. Plus all this mayhem supposedly took place in one week? Two autopsies, two more abductions,research, etc. Guess nobody slept at all unless they were in the hospital overnight."
1,Extremely violent sexual crimes. Unjustified abuse of shocking value,"The extreme violence and perversion of the sexual crimes depicted in this book are disturbing and, in my opinion, highly critizable. Please read other reviews to find examples that could help you make up your mind about whether you want to read it or not as I can't bring it upon myself to repeat this books' grossest rape details. The author is undeniably a good writer. Her talent makes this book even more dangerous. I wonder whether the author and her publisher have deliberately chosen to increase the book's box office chances by raising the stakes in shocking value. This was completely unnecessary given that the book's plot and characters are well enough strong without the escalated violence and obscenity of the crimes. Such an escalation of violence could inspire weak-minded people and contribute to trivializing ""ordinary"" sexual crime. I better not think of the effect it could have on young readers."
2,Eroticizing Rape,"I've read my share of serial killer stories, so I know the conventions. This looked to be good . . . it has a really strong female central character and appealing investigators. But I have rarely seen an author eroticize rape the way this author does. The killer tells the women he drugs and assaults that he is ""making love"" to them, which I know is supposed to be a part of the horror, but there's a way this writer constructs the scenes of violence that I find truly disgusting. These serial killer stories are a dime a dozen anymore, and few do more than present disgusting scenes and allow you to see the investigators become increasingly distressed. For books that go outside the genre, read something like Peter Robinson's Aftermath."
2,Mediocre & often annoying,"After all the advance hype, I expected this book to be much better than it is. The three main characters are irritating and hard to like. The author apparently couldn't decide whether to make them warmly sympathetic or coldly off-putting and ended up trying to give both qualities to all three, with the result that their behavior is sometimes jarringly inconsistent. The writing is pedestrian and often clumsy. (Example: Slaughter uses the word ""mumbled"" so many times -- often more than once on a single page -- that it became funny after a while, and the image of all these people walking around mumbling constantly was very distracting.) Long stretches of the book are flat and boring. All in all, a disappointment."
3,"Two and a half stars, really","Pretty gripping, but awfully bloody. Southern background well done (and I speak as a native). Will my stomach be strong enough to finish?Here's a problem I had:A character who is very physically weak, without any significant trouble, steals the revolver of a policewoman who is bending over her.I don't spend time inspecting weapons, but it seems to me that every police revolver I've ever seen is anchored in a big heavy black leather police holster, WITH A SNAP-DOWN FLAP to hold the weapon in. There was no reason for this policewoman to have opened that flap, either."
5,Gripping - Fast Paced and Revealing,"This was an excellent book. It suprised me that is was Karin Slaughter's first novel. It was well written and entertaining. The characters are likable and believable. This was a quick read with plenty of page turning suspense. Some reviewers has commented on the graphic scenes in this book, do not let that stop you from reading this book. It is about a serial killer/rapist. That entire subject is not pleasant - but it does not take away from this story's plot - as a matter of fact - I felt true compassion and sympathy for these characters which I think is a compliment to the author. I can't wait to read Karin Slaughter's next book."
2,Much Potential - - Very Disappointing,"Having not read any of Slaughter's series featuring Georgia coroner Dr. Sara Linton, I happily picked up the recently re-issued paperback copy of the debut novel BLINDSIGHTED. Linton's graphic and disturbing discovery of a young blind woman in a cafe ladies room got things off to a riveting start but went downhill after that with stereotypical involvements (her ex is on the police force)and oh-so-slow progression to a nothing to brag about ending. Unless it's a freebie, I doubt seriously I'll read further novels in this series."
2,Overwrought characters with no emotional control,"The characters' constant agonizing and inability to avoid injuring those about them with their comments made this tiring to read. The mystery was okay, if a little gory, but the on-going emotional storm of the characters' lives was exhausting. I wanted to shout ""Get a grip!"" at them. I started her second novel, but it was more of the same. No, thanks."
5,What an awesome read!,"Make sure you Pollyanna video is close by when you pick this one up to read. Karin Slaughter has taken it upon herself to set the world of thrillers on fire. This start to the Grant County series is dynamic! This author has taken the time to let us get to know the characters we will be spending time with, while simultaneously ripping their lives apart with evil.And let's talk about evil, the villain of this tale is so...evil...I can't think of a more horrible word to describe him. The story is a humdinger, from one page to the next, your mind is whirling with questions, and doubts, and more questions. While I did guess, and I do mean guess, who the villain was, until the very moment the why is revealed, I did not have a clue how I guess correctly.This book is frightening and hypnotic. I read it on my Palm T/X and my thumb will never be the same for turning those pages as fast as I could to get to the next one. An excellent read. No doubt!"
4,Small Southern Georgia Murder Mystery,"This is the first book in a series featuring pediatrician and part time coroner, Sara Linton, and her ex-husband, Jeafrey Tolliver. How weird of a combination of jobs is that, pediatrician and coroner? But, Slaughter makes it work. The murders are gruesome (in ways I had never imagined!) Descriptions are graphic. All in all, a good whodunit mystery kind of read."
1,UGH!,"Gratuitous gore and violence, cliche characters and plot. The perfect book for all the readers of slasher serial-killer trash novels. After all the good things I'd heard about this book, I can't believe how poorly written and executed it turned out to be. And there's two more coming? Well at least I can take them off my 'want' list. Too bad Ms. Slaughter couldn't include some of the better aspects of the female crime-writers and their characters and leave the 'made-for-TV' movie stuff out."
1,Terrible,"As an avid reader, I can state with assurance that this books sucks. I only made it to page 17 before I had to put it down."
1,"Gratuitous violence, and a hum drum, cliche ending","This was clearly written to feed off the public's seeming desire for gore. It reads like a how-to manual for serial killers, and the ending is straight out of a Lifetime Originals Movie. It's that cheesy. Save your money and buy something else from a writer who can do more than coat countless pages with blood to hide a thin plot."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Karin Slaughter&#65533;&#65533;s debut novel comes with some thrills and quite a bit of emotion.Dr. Sara Linton is a part time coroner and a full time pediatrician for the Heartsdale Childrens Clinic. Jeffrey Tolliver, Heartsdale&#65533;&#65533;s chief of police, is Sara&#65533;&#65533;s ex-husband and sometime friend. Sara and her sister Tessa are eating lunch at the local diner. When Sara goes into the bathroom she finds Sybil Adams, an acquaintance, mutilated... and bleeding to death. The case hits pretty close to home because the towns only female detective, Lena Adams, is the victims sister.Relationships and a wide range of emotions dominate the story creating a good depth to the characters. Ex-lovers, distraught families, and secret pasts all play a part in a sometime graphically violent and often emotional novel.Recommended"
3,Okay but no great shakes,"Nothing original here, not in the setting, plot or characters. Not even the gore is original. But the writing is competent. I think it is grossly unfair to say Slaughter is a worse writer than Kathy Reichs, however, since no one is a worse writer than Reichs!"
2,Blindsighted Comments,"I had heard good things about Karin Slaughter's writing. This was my first of her books. But for me it was nearly impossible to get through. I quit reading several times but each time felt I should keep going and give the author a chance. The story is gross and disgusting. The characters are mostly unlikeable. The book is not clever or suspenseful. On the positive side, her writing skill is good. I love a good mystery, this is not one."
4,"Early Slaughter, but still very enjoyable.","This is one of Slaughter's earlier (if not the first) novel about the fictional Grant County in middle Georgia. It is a very good start in her series that stars a lady county coroner who becomes deeply involved, along with her neighbors and growing-up friends, in a murder mystery. It might be just a little more wordy than her later novels featuring the same coroner/sleuth, operating sometimes solely in the fictional rural setting and at other times in the metropolitan Atlanta district. I'm almost finished, and I still haven't quite figured out who the villian is, which has me going back to finish it (from my Kindle) in every spare moment.Excuse me, I have to cut this short. I need to see WHO-DUNNIT!"
3,Yuck...Gross...and at times interesting.,"This book is beyond graphic. There is a place for violence in crime novels certainly (and in the true crime genre). However, I'm very disturbed by this book. I usually have a tough stomach for this kind of thing, but parts of were so vivid that I wondered if they were really needed for the story. In fact, the violence overshadows the book. I had hoped the characters would shine through and that the story would make the violence secondary. Instead, it is a bit of odd end and the characters are soaked in blood. A bit much for me. Maybe not for you."
2,Over-hyped,"This book was not an unpleasant read but to review it like it's great literature or even a great Whodunit is ridiculous. The writing wasn't bad but every now and then it had a jarring note. The characters were not well drawn, the ending was horribly predictable and weak. The murderer was neither scary or believable, although I did like the outlines of the pediatrician/coroner. I don't think the book lives up to its marketing."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I didn't expect much from this book. I have been very disapointed lately with my favorite authors (P. Cornwell, anyone?) and I thought I'd give this unknown (to me) author a go. I liked this book a lot. The plot was interesting, the story was fast-paced, the descriptions were good. Overall, it was very enjoyable. I will look up the other books by the same author."
4,Quickly covers the basics,"This book is a good overview of what is needed to effectively train staff. It covers everything from adult learning to evaluating programs. It doesn't offer depth on any topic, but if someone needs to learn about training quickly and easily than this is an excellent source."
4,Good Group,Not a bad CD overall. They don't seem to have made enough hit to fill a full CD which evident but I like a handful of the songs.
4,stop with the remakes,This CD was a good album overall. But why do the music industries keep allowing groups to remake old songs. Let's just get on with our lives and leave the past behind and be more original with our songs. One song had over a 2 minute instrumental intro which got boring really quick. It shouldn't have been over 50 seconds.
5,A great book for my 2-year old,"My boy's first tattered book! This is a great book to read to a 2-year old. I like the rhyming.BTW, I went to MSU with Jef's wife. Hi Jef, Hi Patti!"
2,Not what I expected,"I realize that these are not expensive jewelry, but I have earrings that I've paid less for that look much better. I was disappointed with these. I love the colors, as I wear a lot of black and thought these looked great online. Simply put, they just look cheap. Even the silver leverback looks & feels cheap. Very disappointed."
2,These are NOT Swarovski Crystal,"These earrings are really pretty which is why I didn't give them only 1 star. They are however completely falsely represented in the sense that the description is a flat out LIE! The beads are not Swarovski crystal, they are merely sparkly beads that you can buy at a hobby shop. I've seen the exact same beads at Hobby Lobby and they are an inexpensive synthetic crystal (I make jewelry in my spare time and I could make these for less than $5 a pair, so you guys are being ripped off). I'm really upset that these are total fakes and from now on I will only buy swarovski crystal jewelry from certified swarovski dealers and never on Amazon again."
5,The perfect earrings.,I really love the look of these earrings! I was trying to match a necklace and they turned out to be perfect! Another advantage is the Leverbacks since I don't like hooks that get caught in my hair. The Black and Clear Swarovski Crystals are beautiful and the earrings have a very dressy look without being too long for me.
5,SIMPLY ENCHANTING,I purchased these earrings for my daughter who is quite a fussy gal. She loves them. That says it all for me.
5,More beautiful in person,"I bought these because I have no black earrings at all. When I saw the picture I thought, ok, these look good, I'll take them. When I got them (2 days later) I was completely shocked to see how really beautiful they are. Very sparkly, very lightweight, yet great quality. I am not disappointed in them whatsoever! I can wear them to the office but I can also wear them with my ""little black dress"" for special occasions. They're so versitile! BTW, if you have short hair or wear your hair up, the light catches them just right and they will just sparkle."
5,Great,"I bought this earrings for my fiancé and she love it, it a great earrings and will recommended it for anyone to but it"
4,Sterling Silver Simple Beauty Black Clear Crystal Earrings,These earrings are exactly as pictured in size and color. The size and design are perfect for casual /everyday wear and they have a lot of sparkle and shine.
4,Probably worth it,"3.v is probably Zebra's best album, although it's hard to go wrong with their first album. What's wrong with this collection is the 2nd album, No Tellin' Lies. Mostly made up of older material, it's not a great album. There are 2 or 3 good tracks on No Tellin' Lies. The best one is Bears.That said, 3.V is practically flawless. While the first album was a nice hard rock (probably heavy metal at the time) with nice hooks, and the 2nd was an ok hard rock album with few hooks, 3.v is Zebra reborn as a hard rocking pop outfit.The album went absolutely nowhere, but after 16 years, the album holds up very nicely.Given the price of this set, it's well worth the purchase, though you might want to rip it, and remove some of NTL's weaker tracks.4.5 stars for 3.v2.5 stars for NTL"
1,0 + 0 = 0,"Zebra were like a pox sent from gOd, the only thing worse than one Zebra Album is two Zebra albums! Here are my reviews of these two!Zebra No Tellin LiesOnly in the eighties could such banal ... rock have been recorded, thank gOd this band has disappeared into the black hole that swallowed the whole horrible movement. FZebra 3.VThe stupid album title is an indicator of greater lameness to come. This album made me want to vomit. Actually, I'm ashamed to admit I ever owned it, even if only on vinyl. F"
5,Outstanding reading,"This book is really a 'must have' for any armed citizen, police officer or military member going into harms way. It goes into detail describing what happens in a 'use of force' scenario and the bodies physiological and physical response to the high stress and anxiety involved in deadly force encounters. The book was written by two career police officers/agents and is a compilation and case study many years and shootouts in the making. Buy yourself a copy of this book and then pass it along to a battle buddy, you won't be disappointed."
2,A poor quality critique of charismatic fakes.,"This book lists some of the religious phonies the author has seen/heard of. He argues that Christians should not give up on supernatural manifestations because of phonies, but should become more discerning of scams while embracing true manifestations of the Holy Spirit. His style of argument is very illogical, even though his conclusions are usually correct."
5,Maxim wooden table,This table is exactly what I wanted. It is very durable & heavy. We put a wooden train track on it and it works out great. The quality of this table is much better that the Thomas table at a third of the price. (The difference is there is no pictures on it) I would buy this again.
1,Feh!,"Micheal Ventura's THE DEATH OF FRANK SINATRA is the kind of book I cannot stand: drowned in a sea of screaching, ""Look at Me I Want a National Book Award!"" bilious prose, too pretentious for the planet earth, filled with characters who spout non sequiters like they're trapped in a French New Wave film with fouled-up subtitles, and a plot like a hastily assembled balsa wood outhouse. I felt especially cheated by the Kennedy assassination hook that lead absolutely nowhere."
1,fake/phony/fraud,"I was intrigued -- I thought it was an investigative report on Mr. Sinatra's final days (the tackiness of the title notwithstanding), but then I noted from the reviews quoted that this title came out *before* May 14, 1998 (the day of Old Blue Eyes' death) -- meaning this was just a work of fiction. Feh, pfui -- what a waste of my time! I'm interested in *real* books about Frank Sinatra, not fiction! How about someone coming out with a *good* discography?"
3,"Dashmat for 2001 Nissan Pathfinder - Not the best fit, but OK","This dashmat is not an exact fit. Although it is contoured to much of the dash, it is too long in areas. This makes it buckle in certain spots. I have given it time to ""relax"" in the heat, and if the dashmat were cut to fit better, it would probably sit evenly across the dash. The problem is you can't trim the mat without cutting the binding on the border. If you did it would fray. Thus, an imperfect product that is fair at best. The Ultimat is a Dashmat product that is supposedly an exact fit to every vehicle, but it's not made for this car. I emailed the company to see why they don't offer their Ultimat for the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder. I was sent a very basic response that indicated to me that they just didn't care. I don't think I'd recommend this product or company."
1,How many loose strings and plot holes can you find in this book?,Ms Michaels is a good author so I hesitate to blame her for this awful book. I'm going to blame the editor instead. This book has so many loose strings and plot holes and ridiculous dialogue. I think bookstores better slip this book in the game section because it became a Where's Waldo task for me to find the errors in every chapter. At first it made me mad. Then it made me laugh. Every author has their writers block moments and this one must be Ms Michaels. A bitter heroine who might be stronger than her weak charactered brothers but is just as spiteful as her horrid father isn't what I look for in a romance novel. Save your money and your time and skip this one. She has better novels out there.
5,New York Times Best Seller,No. 4 on the New York Times Best Seller List...way to go Fern Michaels!! You had my attention from the first page on. I couldn't wait to find out how Nealy and Emmie would develop and make their way in life. I loved the way you used some of the titles of your other best seller books as the names for the horses in the Derby race. I can't wait to read the second book in the series.
2,Adult Fairy tail,"While this book series was easy reading and not badly written, it really read like a fairy tale where everyone is the richest , the prettiest and the most famous all the time, and always knows the most important people. You just know everyone is going to live happily ever after... not like real life..Terri Glass"
3,Not Fern Michaels best series.,I saw the other reviews were not the best but I decided to buy the series anyway. The other two Vegas and Texas are much better compared to this one. I wouldn't recommend buying it. To predictable and silly.
5,The Family reunion of all time's Colemans and Thorntons,"The Family Reunion! This book has it all Sallies Vegas and Billy's Class of Texas and Nealy's Diamonds.I loved how Fern brings all the love and grander of two families in to one book ,and the one thing that touched my hart in this book is how she uses Grit in all the books but the one thing that still stay's in my mind is how Nealy said to the family at the door ""Im nealy Coleman and you are?""Nealy Coleman is to me like having Emilia Coleman,Fanny thornton,Billy Coleman and Maggie coleman wraped into one strong woman and she is what do you exspect from a Derby winner and a triple crown .Kenticky Rich is everything you would exspect money, power ,love and tears ! It is only a 3 hour jet ride from Texas to Las Vegas ,Nevada but only one page to Kentucky ! but like the back of the las vegas welcome sighn it says on the back come back soon and that is what Fern let's us do !Its called Kentuck Rich ."
1,Bland,"I haven't read any of her books before so it might have counted against it but I didn't really enjoy this book. The plot is quite cliched and I thought way too much of the plot was carried off in conversations. Overall, there wasn't much fluency and the writing wasn't that good. I thought it was a bit unbelievable from being able to adopt Nealy and Emmie right down to winning the races. I guess that's what you calll fiction. Anyway, I have read better books. I can safely say it was a waste."
1,Don't waste your time or money,Pure fantasy...for anyone who knows anything about horses or horse racing will be rolling their eyes with disbelief. What a big disappointment....guess I should have held out for Janet Evanovich...at least I laugh alot and enjoy her fantasy.
2,"An okay story, but...","...not for those who have not read the previous series -- the Texas and Vegas series. I haven't read those books, and I suddenly felt that there were all these unknown characters thrown in the mix more than half-way through. It was very confusing!The other problem I had with this book was the multiple plots and climaxes. Nealy's young, the Kentucky Derby is a big deal, that whole story line climaxes and is resolved in a few pages. On to the next, and the next, and the next. All the characters end up being underdeveloped and shallow, sometimes doing things you wouldn't expect (would her daughter REALLY have hidden out for a week after the problem on the cruise? It just doesn't fit the character!).The story was interesting, but there were just too many flaws. I won't be returning for the rest of this trilogy."
5,Precious Reading,"Rowdy the Sheltie was one of the cutest books I have ever read! Rowdy is so precious you just want to pick him up and hug him and never put him down! From the opening line to the last paragraph, you are drawn into Rowdy's world. And the artwork really adds to the whole. I also have the little soft toy of Rowdy and I held him the whole time I was reading. You just want to kiss him and hug him and never let him go! I sure hope there is a sequal to this first book!! I'm looking forward to another day with the grown-up Rowdy! Thanks, Brenda Tatro and Daryl Wamego for bringing this precious little baby puppy to life for the rest of us!!"
1,Misleading Size Info,"The Ad shows size of 1.7oz. But when you add it to the shopping cart, the size changed to 1oz. As one of the review points out, this seller is a con artist."
1,Dishonest advertising,"After reading the reviews, I confirmed that the 1.7 oz advertised amount changes to 1 oz when you go to check out.Like anything else if they start out with a lie ..you just can't trust their product or their company.Plus you can get it cheaper on other sites."
3,Not a good deal if you only send a couple of text messages a month,"I end up canceling this for my monthly plan because between my fiveFav and 1200 any time minutes per month, there is no need for me to text anybody. If you have limit minutes and are used to text messaging constantly, this may worth signing up. Make your own call."
3,Old Christian songs,"This little book has some hard-to-find old Christian songs, one of which I had been looking for for a long time."
3,Comprehensive book on dreamweaver,This is an older book now but if you have a copy of dreamweaver 8 then this is a good book to pickup. Helped me get through some early sites I was building. Most of the things you need to know are free online if you know the right searches though. Just take some classes online or search you tube.
4,OK,"I had started to work on this a few years ago, so it's probably a little dated as far as technology goes, but it is helping me now that I've started it over. I think it's not as exciting as I thought it would be and that made me not as interested, but once you press in, there are really good tips and the step by step process prepares you for the realities of web development instead of just how to make a flashy colorful site, which I'm hoping it will also cover soon. ;o)"
2,Dreamweaver 8-Training for the source,"Being familiar with HTML programming and Front Page 2003 (and of course Word 2003), this book is boring. Though the author explains something, the author goes back again and again in the same topic. In one lesson I was so confused that I finally fixed the problem by HTML coding. Another major problem is author's unclear definition of a file as part of a directory. For example: In Lesson_04, she states the following to open index.html file:Open index.html from Lesson_04_CSS folder. This is not true. It should clearly state: Open Lesson_04_CSS\Completed\index.html. There are others index.html files in Lesson_04. Good thing of book the CD files to check.Joseph"
2,Boring book,"After reading some of the review for this book on this site, I question if these reviewer were sober when they wrote there reviews. The book is boring,and after a few chapters you'd maybe start looking for a new book. And if that CD breaks, from what i've been told, you'll have a hard time getting another one from the book company. I'd suggest you check out your local book store and take a look inside the book before you buy it; it would save u alot headache."
5,Good intro,"This book served as a good introduction to the powerful toolset Dreamweaver 8 offers as well as laying the groundwork for foundation CSS and design concepts. If your an experienced Dreamweaver user, this book might be something you can skip as it seems geared more towards beginner to intermidediate.Great starting step for new Dreamweaver users."
5,Great walk-through,"I recently picked up a copy of Dreamweaver 8 as a possible alternative for my current development environment. I can be a bit old fashioned and am much more experienced using emacs rather than any other tool for developing websites. Having zero experience with Dreamweaver or other similar tools I decided I needed a good reference to help me jump in, and this book has served that function well.The writing is clear and generally concise, the information is easy to follow and has done a good job of helping me jump in to this new world."
5,BEST METALLICA EEEEVVVVEEEERRRR!,Its the very best. Best songs are THE SHORTEST STRAW BLACKENDBUY IT!
4,Metallica's heaviest album.,"To me this was Metallica's best album, next to their self-titled fifth album METALLICA. Kirk Hammets solo in ""One"" is one of the greatest guitar solo's I have ever heard. Being a guitarist myself, I have tried to play it, but it's too fast. I give this CD 4 stars. ROCK ON, METALLICA!!!"
2,Not worth it!,"I bought this SHM-cd thinking it would at least sound a little better than the original one! Unless you need a special Shm-cd player, this release on a normal player doesn't sound any different from the domestic one. Usually Japanese releases sound better, but not here. This album needs a remastered job real bad!"
5,Departure,"This Metallica album represents the change from hard core, fast-paced thrashmetal, to the slower, but still heavy as ever, side of the rock spectrum. This album takes a serious look at the corrupt justice system and government. It also lights the fire of many rebellions with songs like Dyers Eve and Justice For All. Of course, it wouldn't be a Metallica album without the ritual song foretelling of future death and destruction. The song I speak of is Blackened. You can almost see the bombs going off as the world slips into chaos. One, probably the best song on this album, continues the spirit of Disposable Heroes as it looks at life from wounded warriors point of view. When you come down to it, this album really brings out the true Metallica. Fast paced, but also subdued. Heavy, yet light, it is probably the most contoversial album Metallica has done. I give it 5 stars and would suggest it for any rock lover. As for Metallica fans (like myself) this album is a must-have for your collection."
5,...And Justice For All defining moment for Metallica,"With the death of bassist Cliff Burton, metallica returned from Europe asking questions and looking for answers. After finding new bassist Jason Newsted, the band went to work on their new album. ...and Justice for All is fueled by the confusion, anger and questioning of metallica after their loss. They saw the injustice of the world, just like saying, Why did this happen to me?' So all their songs can ahve dual meaning; greiving their loss and also questioning the system. Although not as trash as they once were, the band progressed to in-your0face, make you want to go out and kill people music with songs like Blackened, the title track, Eye of the Beholder, Frayed Ends of Sanity, and the fastest song on the album, Dyers Eve. This is why the call it heavy metal, the bass and guitar compliment each other excellently and Lars' on the drums make it an excellent album."
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!,"I'd say this album is almost as good as Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning, but still worthy of 5 stars. I love the energy that Metallica has in this album. Songs like One, Harvester of Sorrow, and Blackened are really great. So if you're just getting into Metallica, your best bet would be to get this, MOP and RTL, and avoid anything after the Black Album."
4,please...please...please...please...please...,"This is a heartfelt message to Metallica... PLEASE remix this album! Do it, do it, do it... the only the thing I hate about this album is its regrettable lack of low end (Jason Newsted's missing bass). If remixed (and we KNOW they've got the money to do it) it would probably go gold again at least. Come on, you rich old bastards... give Metallica fans what they really want."
5,Solid,"Probably Metallica's most well-rounded effort of the early years. A solid rocker, a little tamer than ""Master of Puppets"", and very polished. I reccomend this album to anybody that hasn't listened to a lot of Metallica, or has just heard the stuff on the radio. At the time it was released, this was heavy heavy stuff, but over the years I think it has mellowed, if only because of the other music on the market has gotten much harder. Don't let that stop you however, this album still hits hard."
5,The Best Metallica,"After the death of Cliff Burton, Metallica pressed on with new bassist Jason Newsted and delivered their greatest album here. Every song, from Blackened to Dyers Eve, shows Metallica at the peak of their technichal and songriting abilities. Metallica would never even come close to acheiving the greatness of AJFA, and I din't think they ever could...perfection is hard to repeat."
5,ONE,I bought this cd just a few months ago. I heard it was reallygood but the production was not to scream hurray for. I listened to it and nothing was wrong with it. Honestly. Only the soundcould have been better but anything else was fine. This was theirbig breakthrough. The album was released between MASTER OF PUPPETS and THE BLACK ALBUM and got into #6 on billboard 200.This album is great. Although it isn't as good as Master itbecomes my 2nd favourite or third. This contained also theirfirst hit single ONE. A great song on the album. If you don't have this one buy it you won't regret it.
5,The Last!!!!!!!!!,This is was the last Powerfull Dark album Metallica would ever make (AWESOME).Anything after that was PURE GARBAGE. Any true Metallica fan can vouche for that..
3,It has its high points,"Sure it has its high points And Justice For All,One. But I dont see what the hype is about it. Its decent but not a landmark achievement.Blackened:8/10: The beginning sounds really cool, the riffs are alright but the solo is the high part of the song and one of the best solo's on the album.And Justice for All:9/10: Great song, has some cool acoustic part's and some catchy riffs almost as good as one.Eye of the beholder:6/10: The main thing about this song is its boring.One:11/10: A masterpeice.Shortest Straw:7/10: Decent, has a cool solo.Harvester of Sorrow:7/10: It is pretty catchy, you hum the song in your mind.Frayed End's of Sanity:5/10: This is one of the worst song's on the album. The solo's alright.To Live is To Die:8.5/10: This is an awesome song, cool intro and solo's but theirs only talking and this couldnt have been cooler with singing, cliff burton's only song on the album, its the third best album on the cd.Dyers Eve:5.5/10: What a bad way to end an album."
3,decent,"this album is pretty good and is heavy, but my complaint is some of the songs are to long and drag."
3,Turning Point,"I see this album as the turning point for Metallica. They made this a political album, which isn't bad on the surface. But I saw it as Metallica's lean toward commercial hard rock style. This album definitly doesn't stand up to the first three. The only good thing about this album was the ""One"" video they did, which is a classic."
5,"Who says it's ""too complicated?""","This, without question, is the greatest Metallica almum ever composed. I seem to be alone in my Metallica opinions, which I stand by. Some examples of these opinions would be: I think Master of Puppets is the least good Metallica album, and everyone just likes it for the title track, and Load and ReLoad are extremely musical albums with melodius licks and hard riffs, and the word ""musical"" is why I like Metallica, not the tempo or the lyrics. Speaking of musical, let's get back to the album this review is for. You stupid laymen who don't have the time to interpret the genius of this album because you're too damn busy waiting for the next adrenaline rush just don't get it. I have been a professional 1st trumpet player for the Met opera for 27 years, and I know innovative music when I see it. Nothing compares to this album. Oh yeah, and if you want speed, what's wrong with Dyer's Eve and Blackened?"
3,... Good but not the Best,"There is good songs on this album especially One or Blackened. but a lot of them drive me boring! The Frayed.., The Short ..., Eye ..., this song are really too long . However this album are definitively better than Load an Reload !"
3,"By By old metallica, hello the polished metallica","lets get some thing straight, I was first introduced to Metallica in 1985-6, Masters of puppets.....Great album.., van halen was my band, but with Dave leaving and all, I craved hard, raw rock and Metallica was it. This has nothing on there first 3 albums, especially 'masters of puppets'. To this day, there first 3albums are the only onesI listen to."
3,Where's the bass?,"I remember when this came out back in 1988, and being all excited about the new material with Newstead on bass. I LIKED ""Garage Days"". But wait, where's the bass?. Is there some problem with my amp? Nope, just a complete and total lack of bass guitar. A pity, since the songs themselves are only slightly inferior to the band's previous efforts. Hmmm. Oh well, I'm sure the next album will be a masterpiece of metal. *cue ominous music*"
5,THE GODS OF METAL,"The album that put Metallica on the map is indeed one of the best albums ever made by Metallica or by anyone else. Each song is a true masterpiece including the epic ""One"", which is indeed one of the best written best performed songs ever."
1,The first of the stinkers,"By his own admission Kirk Hammett overplayed on this one and even he can't stand to listen to it anymore, not that he's such a good guitarist anyway."
1,Ouch!,"One? And Justice for All? Why is this recording even listed under the category ""music""? No way do these guys stand the test of time."
1,300 hp tuner,"While the rest of the GTP tuners are struggling to get their cars into the 13s, RAT has managed to coax more than 300 hp at the wheels and has run a best 1/4-mile time (with a slipping tranny no less) of 13.1 at 105.5 mph! We will be top-speed testing the Ram Air Technology GTP-R (coil-overs, 17-inch wheels, BREMBO brakes etc...) very soon. Look for a big top speed number (using our Power PCM) to go along with the big power numbers we are famous for. Performance-not promises."
5,BOTTOM LINE.... METALLICA'S BEST ALBUM PERIOD,"Metallica is as classic as american pie. In an era in which we live in that includes music such as the backstreet boys, in sync, and marilyn manson. We can always look to the heavens and find our generation's Led Zepplin. I truly love Metallica and as far as I am concerned this is one of the best rock albums of all time. ""And Justice For All"" combines LOUD drums (positively the best way to describe it) and beautiful guitar riffs that makes us realize why we love rock 'n' roll so much. If you have only heard Metallica's latest albums and you enjoy them but there might be a little bit of that edge missing, lets face we all mellow out in our older age, immediately purchase this album. It is truly rock 'n' roll at its finest."
5,THE BEST,"Nothing is better than this!!!! 'Blackened','Dyers Eve', and 'One' make dis the esscial Metallica recording. If youu've just caught on to the mega-power that is Metallica, you MUST have this!!!!"
5,The extraordinary last album of Metallica,"The Elegy: the swansong of Metallica. Every song written after this album is irrelevant in the history of Metallica. The MUSIC on this album (despite the bad production) is among the finest Metallica has ever created.but a sad cloud hangs over this album because the fans know the Metallica is about to die.because these are some of the best songs Metallica has ever created, (to live is to die, one, eye of the beholder) this is an important album in the history of heavy metal.any true fan of metallica understands the significance of this album. and we know, unfortunately, what happens to Metallica after this recording. tragedy indeed.R.I.P. METALLICA 1981 - 1988."
4,poor production. SFW! This is Metallica.,"Yes, I have to admit, the production of ""And justice..."", was not good. BUT, this album contains the pinnacle and example of good metal music,""ONE"". Metallica will always be Metallica from ""Garage Days"", to ""S&M"". D"
5,Underrated,"Metallica's 4th studio record, ...And Justice for All, definatly deserves the attention the previous Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning recieved. I will not rate the tracks becuase my opinion matters to no one. Buy this album if you are man enough. (...) Listen to real music about earth dying and people dying like a man."
5,RadicalDreamer has a point...,"(S)he reviwed well the tab book but the link for it leads into the same page of the CD itself. As for the album I don't even need to explain it, it speaks for itself.Best song is 'Dyers Eve', altough 'One' comes close second.Awesome album. Great buy."
4,Bass Please!! 4.5 stars,"In my opinion, thus far this is Metallica's last great album it's no Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets but nonetheless a great one. When released in 1988, I was very disappointed and hardly gave it a chance. It took me years to really appreciate this album and realize how good it was; sadly, I do not see that happening with Load, Re-load or St. Anger that's like wasting plastic. You can tell they were changing their sound but the darkness and complexity that is Metallica was still there. However, this record needs to be re-mixed and remastered big time. I would have given it five stars but the production is dry and the bass is practically non-existent which is what initially turned me off the first time around. Nevertheless, the writing is so good it makes up for it. The first four records are a must own."
3,Good. Isn't it the truth!?,"I like this album, but ""Metallica"" is better. I like this album beecause first off it has good music to it. Second off because the lyrics tell the truth about society. ""Blackened"", ""...And Justice For All"", ""The Frayed Ends Of Sanity""! C'mon, if this isn't the truth then i'm James Hetfield."
2,One extra track for about $30 more?,"Ok first off. This is a great album. But the rating here is because of the price.The only reason Amazon is able to come up with to charge this much for this particular CD is it has one bonus track ""The Prince.""Here's the real CD....And Justice for AllIf you really want the extra track you can find it several other Metallica releases - and for a lot cheaper."
1,overated,"this is one overated band, does this album desearve 1 star? probably not, more like a 3, but the 1 star is for all you fans who thinks this is so great when it's clearly not."
1,Suicide music at its worst,"I can't express with words how much I loathe this album. Its just so incredibly gloomy and depressing. Who wants to sit and listen to 10 minute songs all about death and destruction and darkness? Not me. I don't want to be miserable.Listening to this entire album will poison your mind. It will make you miserable, gloomy, and depressed. It makes you want to kill yourself. Do you really want to buy an album that will put you in a suicidal state of depression?I challange any Metallica fan to give up listening to Metallica's suicidal angst music. I almost guarantee you'll feel better when you aren't listening to Metallica."
3,It Would be better with a Bass Player,"This Album by Metallica would of been a 5 star, but they are missing a sound so important to all Rock/Metal Music, The BASS. I understand that Cliff Burton passed away so tragically and the members were greiving, but it gave the original three members no right to take it out on the new Bassist Jason Newsted. Cliff Burton wouldn't of wanted Metallica to call it quits, and I am sure that he wouldn't want any replacement to be treated the way Jason was. It's sad that Jason was even considered a replacement. To be honest with you, I am a bigger fan of Burtons work, but I still respect Jason Newsted and he wasn't respected on this album. Jason is a very talented Bassist and it's a disapointment he wasn't even heard."
2,This is the crappiest cd ever made. I like the band though.,"The band is awsome, but there is only some good songs on it. So, I wouldn't buy it. I would rather by rap than this."
2,Wait for the remaster...,"This was Metallica's last great album (or even ""good"" album). The songs are awesome -- great lyrics, pounding riffs ... this is Metallica writing and playing at their best -- too bad that greatness was not transferred onto the CD. As said before countless times, the production of this CD is terrible -- since when does a producer attempt to replace bass drum pounding with ""click click click click""? -- and while we are sad that Cliff died, it is not appropriate to mix Jason Newsted out of the picture all together -- give me BASS!! In any event, the songs rock, so it is not an altogether worthless album, but I am licking my chops waiting for the remaster to breath some life into this slumbering giant."
2,AND NO BASS AT ALL...,"Yes, the recording is great even years later and the songwriting is Metallica's most complex but there isnt a trace, snouch, thump or fizz of a bass guitar anywhere on this album. It's nonexsistent!!! Hopefully they'll remaster ""And Justice For All"" and fix the bass guitar once and for all..."
4,Damaged Production,"This album has the most over-complicated song structures and anti-political lyrics I have ever heard. The songs are all extremely fast, and the pace never lets up - if it weren't for this fact, the album would become boring. There is some great material on this album (One, Blackened), but the production values are terrible. The guitars sound like a flock of bees humming along and I would swear that Lars only used kettle drums. The great songs are over-shadowed by this - a huge disappointment. After this release, Metallica became a less angry band and slowed things down a lot; this was Metallica's last thrash hurrah, making it worth having. Not their best, but it's in their top 3."
5,...And Justice for all still serving justice in 2000!,"...And Justice For All is one of Metallica's heavier albums but still it is an album with deep insightful lyrics that amaze even non Metallica fans, this is an album that is a must own for everyone, even for non metallica fans! It has gone platinum plus and it is still serving justice in the year 2000!"
5,More Kick Ass Metallica,"Classic Metallica, classic Metal. This album is full of power, track after track. If you like Heavy Metal and don't already have this, definitely buy it. And if you like Metallica, make sure you pick up their other classics, Metallica Metallica, Master of Puppets, and Ride the Lightning. They will not disappoint."
5,This is Metallica's greatest...,"I think that this album should deserve a 6/5 starts, but they dont have 6 stars... Well this album is Metallica's greatest including their debut album Kill Em All. I think everyone should get this album even if you arent a crazed Metallica fan. This album is awesome, every song is good none of the songs are disappointing. The best song on this album is One i just love that song because it is about some person and a war. Stop reading this review and go out and get it."
4,Classic album.,Need something to spice up your workouts? Need to clear the cobwebs with some old-fashioned head banging? You can not go wrong with this classic.
2,Highly overrated,"This isn't one of Metallica's better discs... when Cliff Burton died after they produced the magnificent ""Master of Puppets"", their prog-rock leanings became pronounced to the point of self-parody. I've got nothing against prog-rock, but the songs on Justice are dispersed, ineffective, repetitive, and directionless. Also, the production is incredibly shoddy; Jason Newsted's bass is completely inaudible, providing a lack of harmony and coherency. Only for die-hard fans."
3,A metal album without bass guitar!! Amazing!!,"Oh boy, how to review this album?? Musically, it's great. METALLICA really went for it, tried to make its own mark instead of only copying the British heavy metal bands of the eighties.This was the debut by new bass player Jason Newsted. Clearly a man of integrity and with his own ideas, one was supposed to believe that METALLICA will grow a lot more.BUt the ironic result was that, even with superb and intrincate compositions, the bass simply CANNOT BE HEARD INT HE WHOLE ALBUM!! THis, along with the thin guitar sound, meant doom to us fans. WHy am I saying that? Metallica, thinking something went wrong in this album, changed producer Flemming Rasmussen, went for producer Bob Rock, and we all know what happened.... Hey never tried again to write such ambitious, intelligent and clever written heavy metal. They went for the mainstream ONCE AND FOR ALL.."
5,Classic,"Song GradesBlackened-obligatory thrash opener, but slightly better than Battery and Fight Fire With FireGrade-B+...And Justice For All-one hell of an epicGrade-B+Eye Of The Beholder-anthem against censorship,underatedGrade-AOne-the prototypical anti-war song, even better than ""War Pigs"" or ""Rooster""Grade-A+The Shortest Straw-thrash-by-numbersGrade-BHarvester Of Sorrow-classic MetallicaGrade-A-The Frayed Ends Of Sanity-Great lyrics, but suffers a little musicallyGrade-B+Dyers Eve-a little overatedGrade-BWhile MOP And RTL were Metallicas Dark Side and Wish You Were Here, this was their Animals. You may not like it as much at first as the others because of its lyrical complexity and epic song-length, but by the 2nd time you listen to it you will like it as much as the others."
5,the last great album,"To live is to die, and justice for all, and one are examples of that symphonic metal style which characterized Metallica at its best, and which, although present on the black album, received far less emphasis and are now no longer existent in the band's repertoire."
5,Great CD!,"This Cd gives you everything you want from Metallica. One, And Justice For All, and Blackend are what every rock listener wants from music and Metallica knows just how to interpret all of them!"
5,As good as they get,This album is an absolute must for any metalhead. This is by far the most dynamic album Metallica has ever put out. Forget what you've heard about their new music--it just can't compare to pure metal. Check out track number 4 if you want to know what I mean.
5,Metallica's masterpiece...Track 4,"WOW! I cannot believe how good the song 'ONE' is! Just listen to this song every day and you'll know what i mean. the rest of the album is awesome... blackened is probably the next best, everything else is awesome! I repeat, 'One' is the best song ever!"
5,ty,this is the second best metallica cd.i have three words about this cd.........IT KICKS...I think the best song on this cd is defintly one.it starts off slow then at the end u can hear a machine gun sound......how can u be a metallica fan and not like this song.......one last thing buy this cd.......
5,Their best,"Ok, I'm not a huge fan of thrash metal. I'm pretty conventional when it comes to music. In my opinion, this album is Metallica's best effort. Prior to this you had some decent songs, but the production was horrible (sounds like they were recorded in a garage). After this album, they turned from a metal band into a mainstream hard rock band with the Black album.This album brought out the best in their technical music skills, topped of their lyrical dramatic themes, and is just beautiful sounding uncompromised songs. I feel that good music transcends genres and if there is any album that could draw people with good ears into true metal, it is this album. It not only showcases technical ability (as many thrash albums do), but it showcases real musical talent."
5,this album was great,"like i said this album was awesome, i just wish they would come out with another album like ---- Kill'em All ----. That album kicked A** !!!! I ,ve liked metallica since thier first album, but it seems that they are softoning up."
4,"It is an excellent album, but has a few flaws.","There are a few very good songs (e.g. One, Dyers Eve, ..And Justice For All etc.), but not enough variety to warrant 5 stars. An album of a very high standard! Recommended!"
4,metallica 4evr,"though it is not quite as good as some of their other albums, it is still an excellent record; the song ""one"" is so captivating"
3,Beginning of the end....,"Troubles with this album:* Drum sound: horrible. Lars Ulrich is not a great drummer, never will be (but he thinks about himself as a genius, that's for sure! The lord of arrogance)* Jason Newsted was a scapegoat for the pain they suffered after Cliff Burton's death. Hetfield and Ulrich simply erased his bass lines from the album! WHy they did such a thing I don't know.* No great solos by Hammett.The good things:* the last album where Metllica did not play ""safe"" and tried to write memorable heavy metal songs."
4,"After you get used to it, its MORE than satisfying","Think about this: You hear ALOT about how shoddy the production work is on this album. But after a couple of listens to it, I cant imagine this album WITHOUT the sounds-like-made-in-a-garage feel to it. After all, isnt that how Metallica started off ?With that said, this is one of their better albums with thrashers as BLACKENED and DYERS EVE, and one of the better early Metallica songs EVER made, HARVESTER OF SORROW. This is Metallica as its angry best !My choice cut (which I cant believe is not more popular in concert) is FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY. The lyrics are dark, the instrumental guitar piece is ELECTRIFYING, and the arrangement is top-notch.The one weak spot is the instrumental TO LIVE IS TO DIE. To repetative and overlong...And what can you say about ONE ? Simply a classic !DONT let people tell you that the production is lousy ! I think its how its meant to be heard...To get under your skin !"
2,The beginning of the end,"Too repetitive and most of the melodies are uninteresting, the counter melodies of the prior two albums are nowhere to be found in this work. I guess those were the contribution of their bassist who died before this album was made. This album is better than any of Metallica's albums that came after it, but that's as positive as I can be about it. The beginning of the end. At least they're selling more product now. Ultimately, all you need from Metallica are 'Ride the Lightning' and 'Master of Puppets'."
3,weell,they have made better i guess but this isn't so good. the lyrics are bad except one and harvester of sorrow. blackened is also very good!
2,WAy Over Rated,"Besides One and Blackened, this cd was a total disappointment. All the songs sound the exact same after a short while. I'm glad my mom actually bought this cd for me(so it's not my money that was wasted) and I'm glad I sold it too. Metallica is one of the most over hyped and over rated bands in history."
2,Huh?,"I just don't get it. How could Metallica, one of the best metal bands ever, release this as a follow up to Master of Puppets? I absolutely love this band, but the songs on this album really do sound like noise and a lot of yelling.On a side note-I have an IQ WAY above 70 (156), and I still love Metallica.I also happen to like Led Zeppelin, too."
1,THE DOWN-FALL STARTS RIGHT ABOUT HERE...,"...which would make this band the sell-out it has become to day.no longer are metallica playing thrash, this is prog-metal aimed at breaking into the mainstream (and somewhat succeded, remeber the ""one"" music video?"" this is simular to what slayer did at exacty the same time w/ ""south of heaven"" w/ simular disterous results. both bands had made speed metal classics in 1986, then on there next albums in 1988, they slowed down at an effort to make it mainstream instead of contiueing their momentum. i really do not like this album at all because it was a prediction of things to come for this band, and the production was crap as well, too bad. i can't belive how many 5 star reviews this got, must be some kind of metalisickness going around, they sold out RIGHT HERE. what was up when they mixed the bass out of this album? metallica might as well of been a trio because jason was treated like crap in that band when he was the most talented of the four, oh well."
1,my god it's dull,"Did you ever hear Tales Of Topographic Oceans by Yes ? They were known for having ""chops"" but holy cow they didn't know when to end a song either.At least Metallica followed this turkey with something as wonderful as ""The Black Album"" to help erase the pain.They sure didn't serve any ""Justice"" on these 2 LONG records.It's more like they were dishing out the punishment.They committed the crime.I just don't know what the big deal is about this particular album,not Metallica in general."
1,Boring,"I loved this music when I was 14, but now I don't get what all the hype is about. It is really boring music, they play the same riff all through every song. It isn't really fast at all just a lot electronics to it that the 80s had, not much content to the songs either, but they are a bit catchy. Probably from DOS or FORTRAN.2 thumbs down, I gave these albums away glad I did. Shows what a joke 80s band were."
5,Justice has been served,"I think this is Metallica's second best studio album behind Master Of Puppets. My favs on it are Blackened, One, Harvester Of Sorrow, Frayed Ends Of Sanity, and To Live Is To Die (reminds me of Cliff Burton, miss you, man), especially the acoustic intro. There's only one problem: the sound quality. I mean, it's good, but it's not as crisp and clean as Master Of Puppets. Also, the bass guitar is nearly left out of the mix."
4,Blackened Is The End!,"I will admit. This was...I believe the sixth Metallica album I bought. At first, I didn't pareticularly like any of the songs except One. But now, I respect and think that there are at least 5 awesome classics found here: Black, Justice, One, Harvester, and Dyers. I could do without Eye, Straw, Frayed Ends, or To Live. Justice is arguably their second-best long song, with Puppets being first. I love that song. One is a song nobody can say enough about. Blackened is one of their most organized thrashers, though Damage Inc. is 1,000 times above any other thrasher. Dyers is up there as well. And Harvester has an awesome rhythm riff and I now love this album, just for those five songs. Must have for any Metallica fan, sellout fan or not."
5,And Then There Was One...,"Stands solitary atop the heap, proud and unsurpassable, as the greatest document in the annals of modern metal. Sure, the production is weird (poor Jason Newsted, like Rodney Dangerfield he never got any respect, at least not from these clowns) but it works. You must own this awe-inspiring creation."
4,Justice Is Served,"This is my favorite Metallica album, which is odd because this album has so many tracks that I faithfully skip over. It's my opinion that Metallica has great songs but terrible albums. On this disc the tracks that I skip outnumber the songs that rock hard. Still, the numbers that do rock hard will leave you pumped and psyched. I love the hard sounding guitars, the pounding drums, and the thumping bass that dominate the best tracks on this disc. Best tracks: #1, 2, 4, and 5. The rest is for diehard fans."
4,not the best of metallica- but its still good!,This is a great cd and the people who think this is music for depressed people obviously are on some kind of drugs. Sure the songs on the cd are really heavy and loud-I got this cd and when I listened to and at first I was skeptical about if this was the cd that I wanted to buy. Then as I listened to the songs I realized that it was a great cd. I think that this record would help people get through tough times with friends and/ or family. Pretty much the only bad thing about this cd is that it has guitar solos that are WAY too long. I would recommend this cd to any heavy metal fans.
3,"I don't know why, I just don't like it","I like 3 of the 9 songs. they sound good, they certainly rock, but for some reason I don't like this album. The cover is classic, The band was fairly good, but I don't think that they were quite comfortable with Jason yet, so most of the music sounds like it hadn't really been well put together or thought out."
4,Great Singles in this album!,"So this CD might not be the best but it's definetly awesome! The song One, The Shortest Straw, Blackened and a few others are some amazing master pieces or music!"
5,love it,i lost this cd a few years back and had to get it again. love it. this is my favorite record by metallica.
4,Cliff Lives On...,"After the loss of bassist Cliff Burton, Metallica fought through a copious amount of audition material to find Jason Newsted. The thing is, I wonder why they even bothered to find a new bassist. Throughout the entire album, the bass has been meticulously and entirely eradicated from every single track. Hetfield has even said himself that the reasoning for this was to show the 'Newkid' that he was no Cliff Burton, put him in his place, so to speak - which leads me to the question, why bother hiring him to play bass for an album where he is virtually inaudible? With that being said, I still enjoy the album, which the bulk of tracks was written by Burton. Best bits? The unforgettable, 'One', 'Harvester of Sorrow' and the beautifully composed (by Burton) 'To Live is to Die'."
5,"This is the last ""One"".",This really is the last of the great metallica cds. Even though they no longer have cliff burton at this time they do an outstanding job of continuing on with this album unlike they did with the black album. One of course if the best song on the cd and is personally my favorite as well. I would recommend this cd to anyone hearing metallica for the first time or anyone who likes 80's metal overall.
5,ascended,"As great as Metallica is, this album proved that Metallica is greatER. This is truly a masterpiece. It is everything music should be."
5,Metallica's best album to date,"I consider ""And Justice"" to be the finest of Metallica's work to date. James Hetfield's vocals are vastly improved over his earlier efforts, the guitar work is little short of sensational, the drumming great, and, most importantly, the content and quality of the songs is consistently and artistically superb. Overall- a masterpiece!"
5,...And Justice for All is one heck of an album,"Metallica hit the top with this album, which might be good enough to beat out Kill Em'All, Black, Master of Puppets, and Ride the Lightning combined. The best album ever over an hour long. SO JUST BUY IT AND BE HAPPY!!!!"
5,AMAZING ALBUM,"Amazing Album second of theres only too Ride The LightningMassivly Underated unfortantly , Blackened is no doubt the best track on this album , and yes the production is horrible but doesnt ruin it all too much .so buy this album and other metallica albums and anything from Radiohead"
5,Metallica: Justice is Served with And Justice For All,"1988's ""...And Justice For All"", is one of their best albums. DFespite the fact that there is almost no bass, they still manage to keep it together. Personal favorites for me include, ...And Justice For All, One The Frayed Ends of Sanity, and To Live Is To Die. Keep it up, and Justice is here"
4,In my very strong opiniion:,"The Frayed Ends of Sanity was the and still is the best song on this CD and they should have played and released it on the And Justice For All Live Boxed Set but alas it is not to be found, the only place that I could find it was on YouTube and it's sad that they did not play it while in San Diego when the boxed set was filmed.I love the snarliness of that song in particular because frankly some of the ways that these women think is beyond me. I would attribute it to them."
5,THE ALBUM THAT GOT ME INTO METALLICA,"I REMEMBER HEARING ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE SEVENTH GRADE AND THATS THE SONG THAT GOT ME INTO METALLICA. THIS ALBUM IS EXTREAMLY HEAVY AND BONECRUSHING. THE TRACKS THAT I REALLY LIKE ARE ""...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL"" ""BLACKED"" ""HARVESTER OF SORROW"" AND ""SHORTEST STRAW."" THIS ALBUM KICKS SO MUCH ASS."
5,THE DEFINITION OF METAL,"I had never even heard of Metallica when I bought this (tape) when it had just come out. Oh my God. Immediately with Blackened I was hooked. I didn't feel like my ears were worthy of hearing metal that sounded so good. I listened to this entire album and I was mesmorized. It was, and still to this day is the best Metal album that any band has ever released. EVER. Yes, Metallica has totally changed now, but this album defined just how talented these guys are. It's a crying shame they never again produced something as incredible as ...And Justice For All. It's the standard of which all other metal bands are measured against. If you don't own this CD what the heck is wrong with you!!!"
5,"you're kidding, right?","anything pre-load is exquisite. the edge has since been lost. kinda like a crown waiting for someone to pick it up and claim it. what can i say? cliff died, the band sold out, and i can understand it. no necessary connection. they were hot, they made it, and then they played to the multitude. they lasted longer than most. then again, i'm a die hard. great music never dies."
5,And Justice For All-Cure For Insomia?,"It may sound crazy considering the hardness and the speed of the music on this album. I love this album, don't misunderstand, but for ten years I have used it when I can not sleep. There is something about the rhythm and speed that is very soothing. It has almost the opposite effect of what I would expect. If you have trouble sleeping why not give it a try!"
5,The Best Metallica Album,"Metallica's finest effort, ...And Justice for All is among the best Heavy Metal Album ever released. The powerful and utterly neat vocals of Hetfield (far from the screechy and cheesy cries of the first albums Kill 'em all for ex.) combined with the astounding Guitar solos of Hammet make this album a winner, the pace of the album never reaches the heights and climaxes of Metallica's first albums, moreover the upbeat tempos and clean vocals make for an adrenaline pumping ride that never disappoints (Dyer's Eve is a lil' bit flat though and lacks the strength and awesome power of the rest of the album).This is Metallica's finest hour (Hetfield finally got his voice right) so bad that it lasted only one album.If you have to buy a Metallica album go for this one and forget Load and Reload.Paolo Cumin azmodan82@hotmail.com"
4,"almost like going beyond our solar system, higher inteligenc","Metalica's all around talent is and has been remarkable and has brought rock way above what anyone could have imagined. The lyrics amazingly feel as if they are magicly comming from within me ""ya i've been there Bro"". so hear is a standing ""O"" for the greatest of all time, METAL-ICA...J.V.DAVIRRO"
4,This album is one of the best Metallica albums ever!,"This, in my opinion, is the best Metallica album second only to ""Master of Puppets."" It has driving guitars and powerful rhythms. That ""Shortest Straw"" song is the best example of this. And who can forget the unbelievable intricacies and musical skill of the classic ""One."" I still jump around in my bedroom while listening to that song once it gets going! If you like this album, you might want to check out some lesser known acts that don't get enough recognition or attention but should. Some great band sto check out include Machine Head, Earth Crisis, Strife, One King Down, Vision of Disorder, and Culture. I think all thes eguys can be found on Amazon.com, too. These guys tear it up just like the Metallica of old, but have more socially conscious and generally more positive lyrics. Definitely a bonus in my book!"
5,Start of the down turn...,"The last good album prior to changing their name to SellOut-tica. Love the album and the songs on it, ...And Justice for All, One, To Live is to Die; awesome songs from the awesome Metallica I once knew."
5,Great!,This is the best album they ever did! Of course ONE is thebest song on here and one of the best hard rock songs ever.But each and every song is really rocking! Don't see howanybody could take any Metallica album over this one.
3,"it is my ""ONE"" and only favorite from these girls","This is metallifag's only good album, infact its very good in most respests, even though i hate this band. ""justice"" actually has good songwritting on it this time, and overall it is a solid album. hammet may not be that good but he does have some pretty good solos here. lars is just lars, horrid drumming. hetfeilds voice becomes annoying w/ his macho lame singing but he does an adequet job w/ his rtythm guitar. and the bass? what bass? yeah, seem's that they mixed the bass out in the mastering process, oh well, its still not a bad album, it is by far the best this talentless group has ever done."
2,Am I the only one that doesn't get it?,"What was the big deal with this album?... One is good, yeah, it's the one Metallica song everyone knows, I don't care who you are, where you live or how old you are. Yeah, it's great. Everybody knows that guitar part in the middle, I don't have to describe it, you know what I mean... Didn't this win some kind of Grammy or something, for what, worst album of the year? Buy the single of One, excellently inspired by Johnny Go HIs Gun (movie/book) and the video is great, one of the most groundbreaking and memorable. Ok wait, let's just run One on here 6 or 7 times and rename it One, then it'll be good."
1,Lousy Packaging,"This review is for the album packaging, not the music. Cheap coarse paper sleeves had the records all marred and scratched before I even took them out of the sleeves. Garbage."
1,a huge let down; poorly produced,"A huge disappointment. What LOUSY production! They should have stayed with Flemming for this one. Metallica peaked with ""Master of Puppets."" The Black Album was better than ""...And Justice"" but I totally lost interest in them when ""Load"" came out. I've met them and was a huge fan in the early 80s'. I'm not a huge fan anymore, although I'll never part with their GREAT recordings in my collection."
1,No Bass,"This is simply the worse Metallica album ever. Contrary to what someone else wrote the bass is down for the WHOLE record. Why? Just to mess with Jason Newsted. As a bassist/guitarist, this album is weak, weak, weak. For a band to have such a great bassist in Cliff, then to get a great bassist as Jason Newsted......Turning him down in the mix.......it's just a shame. To this day I CAN'T listen to this record."
2,Dissapointing,"After hearing the Black Album/Metallica and Fuel, I decided to get this album. It was a mistake. All the songs sound like they havent had much thought to it. Also, the songs are so long. Listening to a bad song for a long time is the worst possible thing. It might just be me, but I don't know. But I like Metallica and this is not like them."
3,ahhh...so so,"The 1st 4 songs on this CD are really really good, but the others are just boring. If your pressed for money, don't buy this CD, but if you aren't go ahead and buy it, the first 4 tracks make it worth it."
5,possibly the best metallica album,"i own all of the metallica albums, and AJFA is my favorite one. all of the songs are good i can listen to the whole thing withour touching the skip button. It also has a variety of songs; you have ""blackened,"" and ""dyers eve,"" which are extremely fast songs then you have ""one"" which starts off slow and gets fast, and all the others are good too. the insturmental ""to live is to die"" is amazing, from the guitar work to the drumming i think it is metallicas best instrumental. It is not a cd you get tired of after listening it a few times either. go out and buy this cd, you wont be sorry."
5,HAMMER OF JUSTCE CRUSHES YOU,"At first this album didn't really catch my attention with the exception of ONE . The First time i ever heard it, I was like what the hell was that . I have never heard anything like it, my mind was blown away by it and I didn't expect it. This Angry Metallica at their angriest this is their second best Expirement behind Puppets it is more complex than Master of Puppets though. The songs are an average 7 MINUTES LONG SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM YOU BETTER BE READY TO LISTEN TO THESE LONG MASTERPIECES. The song ONE is the Best song ever it responsible for my long hair . That Song has influenced me like nothing I ever heard."
4,The Case of the Speluncean Explorers,It's a fantastic account of legal thoughts in fictional form. But I am not sure whether people who are not interested in legal philosopy would like it.
2,Mouse is a little too rat-like,"The mouse is not cute, it looks a little like a rat with that buck tooth sticking out. You would not want that creature climbing on your dinner table eating your parsnips, blueberries etc."
5,Magnificent - A whirlwind general,"From his birth to the end of the world war II, Otto tells it through his eyes; the glory and horror of war. His visit to Naples before the war springs his millitary career into high gear. Brilliant millitary success after success drives him to elite status; making him crude and rutless to be feared... ""Hitler's favorite commando"". A must for die-harden fans."
4,"Great, but not the best...","Unrepentant and loudmouthed is the way Skorzeny lead his life and the men of his SS special forces. If you want to read a revisionist, mealy-mouthed apology by a man who lived his life on the edge, this is NOT the book. On the other hand, if you want to gain perspective into the man and his times AS THEY REALLY WERE, this is the book for you. A great read, but for the full story, read ""My Commando Operations."" No professional military officer should be without this book."
4,Nice cheap performance...,"Not much to say other then:The highs are clear and not tinny.The mids are decent enough, nothing to write home about.And the lows are pretty ""ok"". Not the best on the market.They do look extremely cool, but who cares what they look like when they are behind the factory door grilles?These are defiantly a budget speaker but do perform well enough to be worth buying."
4,Excellent book for new and experienced profeesionals,Iam an experienced inflight catering professional for more than 17 years in south east Asia and this book enriched my knowledge to a large extent
5,Inflight Servise Manager/ AeroSvit Airlines,"Dear sirs, please help me to order that book via money transfer.

4,Some Great Anatomical Engravings,"Remiscent of Andreas Versalius, however not as complete at only 62 pages. Pietro is obviously a lesser known Italian artist from the 1600's, however his work is marvelous in itself. Showing the anatomy dissected in pose the muscles, organs and nervous system of the human body. No text accompanies these drawings besides and introductin and plate names. For the price it is well worth it for the student of anatomy and art, however if you have yet to get Leonardo's work on the human body or Andreas Versalius, then get those first."
5,"I'd never cried while reading, until now...","I began reading this amazing book late one night. It kept me turning the pages till well into the early morning hours. It is such a beautiful, honest and sincere account of a big sister who did her best to take care of her little handicapped baby brother - And what a sweet brother he was!Cheryl's book had me in tears in several places as I empathized with the problems and challenges faced by her loving parents. I am delighted she has now been successful in publishing this beautiful story and that she has developed into a hugely talented woman who has shared her abilities with so many people. ""Johnny Angel is My Brother"" is a book worthy of any cherished collection.Do read it!"
1,Skeptic,Really having a hard time believing this book. Maybe its just my skeptical nature but just being honest to review this book.
2,Most of this collection is just plain lamb,"I'm sorry Roger and fans, but after the first 5 tracks on CD1, I can't listen to anything else. The cover songs and live Who stuff is good, but the rest is just that cheesy late seventies, eighties garbage with synthesizers and no rock or soul at all to the music. My suggestion is if you are a Who fan then just buy Rogers' first solo effort and leave it at that."
2,NOT the best dictionary for students new to Arabic,"I purchased this book based on the mostly glowing reviews from other reviewers and I am very disappointed. The Arabic fonts used are SO small that, at times, it is actually quite difficult to make out the letters. Definitely, NOT a book for people who are new to the language."
3,Average,"This is a good starting point. It is widely available and affordable. It is obviously based on British-English. So, it will probably take some getting used to by those not accustomed to British phrases and spelling. You must have some idea as to which word in Arabic you are aiming for prior to deciding amongst the given choices. A few words were found to be incorrect. Since this book is limited in word volume you will certainly end up having to search for some words via a second source at some time. I do beleive that this is the way to go for beginners and those looking for a bargain."
3,decent (...),"as arabic dictionaries go, this is not bad. (compared to the standards of english-european language dictionaries, it's terrible. unfortunately no english-arabic or arabic-english dictionaries measure up to these standards.) the presence of plurals/imperfect verbs/etc. in the arabic is very nice as it saves having to look them up in your hans wehr, but at the same time it takes away space, and this dictionary, despite its bulkiness, is not nearly complete enough. you will get frustrated trying to find translations of abstract nouns and verbs, phrasal verbs, etc, as many of them are simply missing, or translations for only some senses are present. what's worse, there are no glosses to separate out the senses, and even worse than this, the translations given are often not correct in terms of providing the most-used term first, despite the title's claim of covering ""current usage"".(...)"
2,ARABIC SCRIPT TOO SMALL,"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The Arabic script is so reduced in size that one strains to discern the diacritics (the vowelizations and 'dots'). Size is most important in Arabic printed script, since the diacritics are crucial for error-free understanding. I have better than 20/20 visual acuity but have to use a magnifying glass to ascertain the details of the Arabic script --- and even then not very comfortably.I am sorry that I spent money on this decidedly 'unfriendly' opus. 'Awde/Smith (Hippocrene), an unassuming paperback, does MUCH better in the print department...!Once again, Oxford University Press disappoints."
1,Arabic Dictionary,"This dictionary was very hard to use. The print is too small to make out what the letters are, so one can't be sure of the pronunciation. In other dictionaries of other languages that I have the dictionary is transliterated in case you are not exactly sure of the pronunciation. I would not recommend it to anyone it is a waste of money."
2,buy a magnifying glass!,"The dictionary itself is fine as far as telling you which words to use and giving examples of phrases. The thing that makes it almost useless to me is the horribly teeny tiny Arabic font. I honestly need a magnifying glass to read it. There are so many places where the font is so small that letters come out as big black blobs of ink instead of distinct, clear letters. Not what one would expect from ""The world's most trusted dictionary.""If this book is listed as a requirement for a class, I would suggest waiting until the class starts to ask the professor if there is an alternative. No doubt, they've heard complaints from previous students about this book and will have suggestions for better dictionaries."
2,Not the best dictionary you can buy...,"While this dictionary does contain a lot of entries, it is English to Arabic only; there is no Arabic to English. It does however show the short vowels, though the script is a little frustratingly small. I took it back once I found out it was only a one-way dictionary. The Arabic Practical Dictionary by Hippocrene is much better (though it doesnt' show short vowels however)."
2,Not the best available,"This dictionary is not the best you can get as a beginner of language. It only includes the english-arabic dictionary, and you cannot look up arabic text... you also cannot look up words by the roots. A much better book is Awde & Smith's Arabic practical dictionary (Arabic-English/English-Arabic)."
3,ONLY English to Arabic!!!,"I don't know, this might be a fine dictionary for someone, but it is ONLY English to Arabic. For me, not that helpful. I returned it and will try the Hans Wehr instead."
4,Arabic English Standard Dictionary,This book is the most famous book for student in the middle east as an Arabic-English dictionary.
3,A good start for education on peanut allergy,"We found out the hard way that our son is allergic to peanuts. After the reaction and the blood test confirming the allergy, the allergist referred us to the food allergy network website and I bought this book.It's a pretty short book, and gives some basic information on allergies. I was still left with some questions, though--I didn't feel it was thorough enough--maybe that's because there still aren't answers, but I was still wondering about some things--like the odds of having another child allergic to peanuts, and whether me eating peanuts during pregnancy would make a difference."
4,A Good Guide Book,My neice has peanut allergies so this book was an eye opening read on the topic. Good information even if it is a little dull as expected.
5,Don't waste your money on Zagats- this book is far better!,"This book is the best resource I've found for dining in Philadelphia... It tells you where to go, what to expect, and what it will cost, all written honestly, without advertisements. I highly recommend it, particularly for those who are new to, or visiting, Philadelphia"
2,Not much difference from previous books by the author,"Mr Cope's work is fantastic. But as a reader of his previous books - from another publisher (A-R Editions) - I was rather disappointed with this one: it does not add much new content to the subject. If you have his other books, there is no point in buying this one."
1,A wealth of great information!,"The book was easy to read. The work sheets were easy to follow and had great tips to prevent identity theft. I think that everyone who has credit problems, should get a copy of this book. The credit repair steps are easy to follow and the work sheets are written in large font for a simple display. Great book...don't delay, go get it!"
2,Response to a Readers Review,"I am incredibly offended at the last posters review. This is no place to espouse such uninformed racist attitudes. I am white and I have met many white people who I would say are racist. People from both sides of the spectrum need this book. To label this book as for ""them"" as the last reviewer did, is ridiculous and makes it obvious that he or she is one person who truly needs to take what this book is about to heart. I apologize to anyone from any of the groups this person targeted and I hope that this post can offer you at least a little bit of encouragement."
1,"Baby Space : Finding, Furnishing, Decorating, and Equipping",This book is a joke. The ideas for making items for a baby's room is right out of pre-school. Margerine tubs for a mobile?!!!Are you kidding me?! Don't waste your money on this book like I did unless you want to know how to turn your bathroom into a nursery (yes it's in there!).
1,Just Dreadful,"A cynical mishmash of clips to celebrate (the latter part of) Barney's last twenty years. Highlights weak songs and weaker ""new"" characters. The scenes at the circus border on creepy. They're is even a hip-hop version of ""Baa, Baa Black Sheep"".....groan! Ignore the neat packaging and go find instead DVDs from the ""Classic Barney"" collection -- titles like ""Barney Rhyme Time"", ""Lets play school"" and ""outdoor fun"". The shows don't feel dated and they were made with a great deal more care."
5,Great Learning Experience!,Barney has been coming into our homes for many years and this Dvd sums up all the best from all the years and its a great learning experience that your children will be sure to love!!
4,Simple Wisdom,"This book is a collection of short quotes & stories of wisdom on success that are expressed by various successful people . Through their various views on what success is and what it takes to achieve it, we are given a prism of perspectives that help us to reevaluate the meaning of success and ways to identify & measure the progress we're making towards it. Insightful & inspiring."
5,I love it!,"I bought this book for my husband several years ago, but I still read it daily. The little stories and quotes really are motivating, and they inspire me to be my best every day."
5,Forget your Grandma's rolling pin,"Wooden rolling pins have been around since the beginning of time. But having to flour it, along with your dough, makes such a huge mess- and then, you still get some dough stuck on it that is less than fun to clean up. Fiesta's silicone rolling pin works with pastry, bread or cookie dough with remarkable ease and never sticks, which cuts preparation time in half and makes clean up a cinch. NOTE: Must be hand washed- it is not built to withstand the heat of a dishwasher, even the top rack."
3,"Wonderful taste, poor packaging","Very flavorful oil, makes a huge difference when drizzled over vegetables, or in a vinaigrette. Unfortunately the bottle isn't very good - the cork doesn't seal well, and the little ""spout"" on the bottle is prone to dripping. There was even some leakage during shipping - just a drop, but there shouldn't be any."
3,one of my fave tunes,"This CD features one of my favorite songs, perhaps ever, called, The Only Way. Very creative, original and even hypnotic!"
1,Not so Great!,I bought this product and never used it. I found other management products to be better suited for my plasma tv needs.
2,just check it out at the library....,"I checked this book out at the library today, and am finished reading it today. The repetition was almost nauseating. And his tone about neighbors makes me wonder if any of his neighbors actually like him. I also noticed a whole bunch of unnecessary self-praise literally from the very beginning. Ugh.The book gets two stars from me because he does offer a few nuggets here and there. Plus, I would actually use his box ideas on my deck, if I decided to expand my garden there. Other than that, I'm sticking to my Vegetable Gardener's Bible, which was FILLED with useful information. It's the book I keep going back to over and over again. No self-praise or put-downs or repetition there, just good information.Move your money over to the Vegetable Gardener's Bible."
1,Bad Idea,"I was so excited to do square foot gardening. We built the boxes just as the book says. We purchased Mel's mix already made and even made some of our own just the way the book says to do it. We spent over $200 on the soil. I justified the cost because I knew we would have the best garden ever and all that it produced would be worth it. Nothing could grow. I talked with our local nursery and he said the soil is way too hot. As I have visited with experienced gardners I have learned you cannot put that much compost in your soil. It burns the plants. This is my second year using my garden boxes. I purchased some regular top soil for about $14 and mixed it half and half with Mel's soil. My garden is doing much better, although the soil is still too hot. I just wanted to take the time to let anyone know not to waste your money."
5,Such quick response! And love the book.,"So nice to get a new book for the cost of a used one, and in such a short time from ordering. I always try Amazon first for my books and other items."
5,very practical and useful,You don't need to be a master gardener to get all the produce you can use. This book give you the guidance to plant a garden in such a way that you WILL get the produce you want with very little weeds.
5,The New Square Foot Gardening book,"I've started my square foot garden late summer for a fall crop. My vegetables are doing really well and I've always had a black thumb! The information in this book was so helpful. I'm looking forward to spring when I'll start a second bed, and be able to plant more of the vegetables I truly love."
4,All New Square Foot Gardening,"Lots of very usefull ideas with only a few that don't seem to make sense for everyone. Written from an efficiency view rather than a farming framework, most home family garden plots can be made much more productive and easy to do. A great deal of ""how to do, with great photos"" is included as well as the layout planning made simple with all the calculations done for you."
5,Mel's Mix is a Must!,"I have been attempting raised bed gardening in Tucson, AZ for a few years. The soil here is terrible, so I always amend it. It wasn't until using Mel's Mix called for in the book that I realized what excellent soil really looks and feels like. I have never worked with anything so light, fluffy, and rich. My plants have grown from seed to 5"" in a week in this soil.I also really like using the grid. I know it may seem silly, and seem like something you could just eyeball, but it really does makes a difference having an actual grid. I was able to plant so much more, wasted so much less space and seeds.One thing to consider that he does not address in the book is companion planting. For example, you would want to know that peas and onions wouldn't like to be in adjacent squares, etc. You could also really enhance your square by knowing which plants work well together, too!"
5,Square Foot Gardening,"Great Book, Great ideas.....I KNOW we can do this and have fantastic results in MY garden.CherylSeattle, USA"
5,The only way to garden,"I have been gardening using the traditional methods for years with a great deal of frustration. Square Foot gardening is really the only way to garden. Moisture control, weed and pest prevention is so much easier with this method and organic gardening is truly possible. I love the format of this new version of the book and it is very easy to pick up and find information as an ongoing resource."
2,too repetitive!,"While the basic ideas in this book seem useful and even good, the author is so repetitive and gimmicky that reading it begins to sound like an infomercial and one wonders what ""Mel"" is trying to sell. It turns out that he's not trying to sell anything other than the method he devised and is so enthusiastic about, but the book could have been a lot shorter and accomplished the same thing. Although he goes on and on about how little work it is and how much space you save and how much better it is than row gardening, he falls short on his descriptions of the protective structures for the individual squares, on starting seeds early and other such details. Another annoying thing is when he tells the reader that he won't explain some things since with his method the reader/gardener simply doesn't need to know. With all that said, I still plan on trying the basic method since it seems sound and indeed easy."
5,The best gardening book,I have tried it and it works. I grew the most incredible tomatoes by the single stem method that I have ever grown before. It was easy and I couldn't believe how much produce I got out of such a small area.
4,Square foot guru.,"I am a fan of this book as well as his first version. The only problem is how expensive it can be to set up his system. (You have to be rich to buy the commercially made ones.) I set up 3 beds using wood and then followed the instructions, leaving out the wood frames, for 6 more. It is a bit inconvenient but it works. Some of the other materials can get expensive but worth it. Suggestion: if you move do not throw away or recycle the cardboard boxes they make a perfect base for square foot gardening and any other system, if you want to avoid digging."
4,Gardening Improved 1000 percent!,"This book was the first book that set me on fire for gardening. Instead of producing one tomato per plant, I'm getting 30 or 40. After my second year of square foot gardening, the only criticism I have deals with his statement that all you need to replenish each square foot with is a trowel full of compost. I find that my plants really consume the dirt. My raised beds easily lose half of their dirt depth in one season, so I really need to replenish with soil and compost to bring the levels up. All in all, a great book!"
4,Gardening A New Way,"I enjoyed this book. I am a vegetable farmer, so some of these techniques will not work for me, but I can see a real benefit for a family that doesn't have a lot of space. Informative and entertaining."
5,An excellent alternative to row gardening.,"While I have not yet tried the methods of gardening in this book, I have to say that it makes sense. It is an easy way to set up a garden so that it is less work. I do wonder about larger plants like cabbages and zucchini plants that like to spread out, but I have to delve into the book more, to see how he handles this. I think his methods are ingenious and I cannot wait to try them. One of the best gardening books I own on methods of setting up a garden. This is an especially good method if you have limited space."
3,Like his first book better,"Although this has a lot of valuable information, I really liked the format of his first version of this book."
3,Decent book On Sqaure Foot Gardening,"I had purchased this book as a gift for an avid Gardner. It's comprehensive and straight forward with regard to creating gardens in small spaces, usually small flat planters boxes.I would have liked to have seen a bit more attention to paid to square foot gardening options that aren't only meant for inner city living. Although the diagrams are helpful the lack of photography is unfortunate.However this aside, this is a very good starter book especially for anyone new to square foot gardening and or looking to make the most of limited space with some innovative ideas."
3,Not as simple as it appears,"I was hoping to get some insight into how to make my existing raised beds more productive but found out it was impossible without using the special soil mix, laying down a grid and sticking to it, and somehow never having to weed. Perhaps if you are indeed starting from square one this book would get you into gardening in your back yard, but plants grow well without the secret soil mix and as long as the wind blows you will have weeds. The didactic tone got under my skin occasionally and I didn't learn much."
3,Good ideas. A surfeit of Mel.,"I like the ideas in the book - they are good engineering, inexpensive to assemble, easy to maintain, and they got me through setting up my square foot garden with minimal fuss. I could almost give it five stars.Except:Mel spends as much time talking about himself and how great HIS ideas are as he talks about gardening. Maybe it comes from having been raised with ideas about humility, or perhaps it comes from liking works that come to the point, but I find reading the book something I can only stomach in small quantities. This seems to be common to a Mel's generation, I got a great book about memory and how to remember large sets of things, and it was wonderful, but that author too spent his time talking about himself. Unceasingly. And it was a great book otherwise.All New Square Foot Gardening would have been wonderful if Mel had kept focused on gardening.I close with a paraphrase.""Mel. Mel, Mel, Mel. Melmelmelmelmel. Mel! Mel, Mel, MelMel."""
2,Ok I've tried his recommendations twice and...,"Ok, I have tried his suggestions twice and I've found plants need MUCH MORE SPACE FOR THE MOST PART WHEN THEY'RE MATURING!!! Both years they started getting too cramped and it negatively affected their health, some more than others.I appreciate it may work for him, but next planting I'm giving ALL my plants plenty of space to spread their wings and grow strong, healthy and with plenty of room and air circulation for their maximum benefit!! Gardening takes alot of time, money and attention, I don't want to waste it on programs that hamper my work."
3,Square Foot Gardening,"Lots of very helpful ideas - however, a lot of ""just talk, fill-in space comments"", could be much more precise."
3,"Good info, too much self promotion","I appreciated a lot of the information that the book had to offer but I found myself getting frustrated. For every page of actual information and direction, there was 4 pages of self promotion and restating the value of square foot gardening. Not to mention the section at the beginning and the end of the book. I am glad that I borrowed it from the library rather than purchased it because I would feel like I didn't get a good value for my money."
5,Green thumb,"I have been gardening since 1966 the conventional Way, row planting. I have had some very large gardens. Up to an acre. A lot of work. I have read the book and it makes a lot of sense to me. Using square foot gardening will relieve me of kneeling and bending as I built my first bed 3 feet off the ground because of arthritis and a herniated disc.I researched the method on You Tube (John Kohler, growyourgreens) and was impressed with what I saw. This book and its methods, put me back in the game. A must read."
5,gardening by the square foot,"This is an excellent book to have. I have had a vegetable garden for many years now and never tried gardening by the square foot. When I heard about it I searched for a book and found this one. It is essential to have, since it gives many helpful tips and explains in detail how to start a square foot garden. My children helped me plant the vegetables about a month and a half ago and we can soon harvest our first crops.I highly recommend this book if you want to start your square foot garden."
5,Excellent guide!,"This book is an excellent reference for the beginning gardener. Instructions are easy to follow, and the reference tables at the end of the book are wonderful."
4,Gardening that's easy to understand and accomplish,"A thorough, clearly written and understandable guide to suburban gardening. This low maintenance garden looks clean, tidy, and well kept. Mel's method is adaptable to nearly any size garden in the landscape, using natural soil components."
4,Everything I Need to Garden....,"This is an excellent book, especially for gardening newbies, like me. I now know what I need to do.Mel's writing style was a little hokey for my tastes, and I think he may have understated the amount of work involved, but all-in-all, it was a good book that I would recommend to others."
3,Not so New,"Breezy, cheery, and helpful in concept. A lot of padding and a lot of pedantry. Over optimistic about weed control."
1,all new square foot gardening,"It is a run of the mill gardening book becauise the original square foot gardening books is so much better. In this book he assumes the gardener is wealthy and they can just go out and buy all of this pre bagged soils and amendments for hundreds of dollars. The first book told us how to make our own soils grow great vegetables with a minimum of store bought materials and how to make your own fertilizers from recycled materials ( manure, garden wastes, coffee grounds etc. with the NPK content). I have had both and kept the original Squarefoot gardening book the new book is for rich city folk that can afford to just go out and buy a garden"
2,All New Square Foot Gardening,"The title caught my interest because I have a very small garden space at my condo. I followed the directions exactly and had a bumper crop of tomatoes this year. The soil mixture was great. My overall rating was low because the author really does not indicate, for those of us who are inexperienced vegetable gardeners, just how large vegetables can get and how completely inadequate the space is for squash, cucumbers and so forth. I will not use this method again, though there is some good information in the book."
2,Ego trip,This is a good book for beginners and as an Advanced Master Gardener I am a firm believer in raised beds. The beginning of the book is an ego trip for Mel about how he is so brilliant and revolutionized world gardening single handedly. The end of the book is just filler with info about plants that is reproduced on the web and in hundreds of books. It just takes up space. Good photos and colorful. Mel's mix should have included some top soil and well rotted manure. Not a bad book but definitely not 5 stars.
4,Can't wait to give it a try!,"This is a great book that is very simple to understand and easy to read. The ideas presented are very compelling and I can't wait to see the results of my square foot garden. Everything you need to know about starting your own garden is contained in this easy to use book. I would definitely recommend it, and plan on buying it for many of my relatives as a Christmas gift. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that parts of it get a little repetitive. I guess that's the author trying to reinforce key points. It's probably not as noticeable if you skip around to various chapters or read it over a longer period of time. I read it all the same night."
5,I have a small growing area...,"I don't have much room and I always look for compact growing ideas. I've owned the original of this book which was highly informative and definitely recommend this version which is even more informative. I don't adhere to the letter of law expressed in the book, but use it's information in a modified manner. If you have limited space this is your book."
4,Great ideas for those of us with less space,I've been using this method of gardening for a few years now and really like the amount of produce that I have been able to get out of so little space. I highly encourage RAISED beds.
4,SF Gardening,This is a interesting little book. Its pretty much written at a beginner level and is oriented toward hobbyists versus larger self-sufficiency or market gardeners. A decent addition to the garden library largely because of its stick to the basics simplicity.
4,Wish we had it years ago.,"Excellent pictures,and the author writes clearly from his own experience. Lots of good information we hope to use this Spring."
4,Fun gardening!,"I only have a limited area for garden, and have struggled in the past. Looking forward to this spring!Thanks"
5,Great book!,This book is wonderful! I have learned so much. I am already planning out my garden for the year. Definitely recommend!
3,The system works; but...,"I liked and still like the ideas behind the methods.However, when he says that its the only way; bull!As an aside, my mom gave me an earlier copy which has much more info. I refer to that one season-wise.Here's to Spring planting!Mule"
4,Updated classic,"I remember watching the PBS series on Square Foot Gardening many years ago, so when I started planting my first vegetable garden in years, I purchased this book. It is still an inviting way to lay out the garden, and Mel has some new methods to make it even more foolproof. Attractively illustrated and written in a friendly, engaging style."
5,Well-illustrated guide for all walks of life.,"We bought this book because it promises to get us outside for a healthy summer activity. Sounds interesting and the illustrations make it seem ""doable"" for any age. We are 82 and 66 and looking forward to spring."
3,6 inches is not enough,"I have tried this method for 2 years now - exactly as written. Many things work well, but to be honest 6 inches is not enough for many of your usual veggies - tomatos, eggplant, peppers, squash, etc. The roots wound up growing sideways and tangling up in each other seriously reducing growth and yields.This year I removed the bottom of the boxes and tilled the earth underneath - so far, much better results.The tips on making Mel's mix, composting, and planting guides are good"
4,A sensible resource,"For those of us intimidated by rows of thriving plants (and sorry for exhausted gardener-friends), this book is a godsend. It is clearly written, has plenty of pertinent photos, and makes a ton of sense. Go for it!"
2,Ugh.,"Honestly, if you can get past the bragging and boasting about how great Mel thinks he is, and how the SFG method TAKES! UP! LESS! SPACE! and how it's revolutionary and how everyone else is doing it wrong, it might be an okay book. But gosh, I think on every page of the forty I read, he mentioned something about how this garden takes up less space. WE GET IT, MEL, it's why we picked up the book! I couldn't take it anymore. I just wanted to read about gardening. You can learn all you need to know from this book by reading the back of seed packets and a few free online resources."
2,Reminds me of infomercials,"I did find a couple of good ideas in this book, thus 2 stars. Some people say this would be good for beginners, but I don't think someone learning should be so restricted by the limits imposed by Mel. Gardening is presented like a mathematical equation. I also realized it's not just Mel sharing his ideas in a book and website, but it's all about sales. His book/forum just promotes the sale of Mel's products. I don't object to someone making a buck, but gardening is more artistic than this book allows. Read the forum on their website before purchasing, you'll quickly see for yourself."
4,Book is great!,"The book arrived in good condition as noted at time of purchase. Shipping time was within the allowable time frame. I had hoped for faster shipping, but it was okay. I would buy from them again."
4,All New Square Foot Gardening,"This book was referenced in The Green Smoothies Diet, by Robyn Openshaw. I have not finished the book yet, so I only gave it a 4-star rating. It's possible I will consider it worth the whole 5 stars when I'm through reading this. The knowledge contained in the book is arming me with knowledge needed for growing and harvesting the enormous amount of greens I need -- with less ground space. (I am on the Green Smoothies Diet.)"
1,Bait and Switch?,"I ordered a copy of Mel Bartholomew's great book ""All New Square Foot Gardening"" and was shocked when I got it to find out that it was such poor quality. The copy I got was printed on coarse newsprint type paper; the book was smaller by an inch or more than the one I had looked at in the house of a friend; and all the photographs were in washed-out black and white rather than color as they should have been. I am not a happy customer!"
5,Where has this book been all my life???,"When my friend told me about this book I was skeptical. I purchased it, read it, and recently tried it. I'm amazed at how easy it was to set up and the initial results are very promising. I think I've just become a believer in Square Foot Gardening..."
4,Square Foot Gardening,"This is the bible of square foot gardening with good instructions on how to build and maintain one. I used it last year with my first attempt and was able to have a small salad garden near the house instead of having to run down to the big garden for items like green onions, basil and parsley."
4,Repetitive on the issues that you are tempted to ignore or skip,"Lost track of the times the author repeated such points as; ""do NOT use the native soil""; ""use only the magic mix i/3, 1/3 and 1/3; do NOT use native soil""; ""use organic compost to top up any squares""; ""do NOT over plant"" and ""one four by four raised bed with a permanent grid per person in household"" to name just a few. Though a shorter book could be written, the repetition should keep the both the novice and beginner on track, if they keep rereading the pertinent section [the whole thing] and happy gardening."
5,ALL NEW,"The Original Square Foot Gardening book was an inspiration and kept me interested in gardening for many years. I always used the information loosely, but the new book has me excited again, and I plan on doing my garden over completely. I haven't got results on the garden to report, but the result of the book is that I plan on following the instructions to the letter this time."
5,sq. ft gardening by Mel Bartholomew,"all it said it was. very pleased with the book, condition was as it said,very promped delivery."
5,great guide for gardening,Great info for gardening in small spaces. Good explanations and easy to follow. I would recommend this product.
5,SFG rocks¡,We have a tiny yard and this method of gardening allows us to make very efficient use of it. We are growing or way to better nutrition and it's fun!
3,square- foot gardening is a great idea.,"This is an OK book, but the first one was better, in my opinion.After I received it and read it, I tried to find another copy of the first book. I finally found my old one. which I much prefer . The changes didn't help, especially the parts of the first book which were left out..."
5,Never thought I would have a garden,"I got this on sale at Amazon Kindle for $2.99. Now I see it's back to $9.99 but it's worth that too.I always thought I have the opposite of a green thumb - even the sturdiest of houseplants died on me.Now, just a few weeks after buying this book I am picking salad greens out of the frame in my backyard.Everyone whoever thought about growing a vegetable should read this book."
5,Simple to read and follow for a novice Gardner.,I found it easy to read and follow....and since I have such a small space to garden it was a perfect book to have.
5,EXCELLENT INFO.,The info contained in this book is right on.I am glad I purchased it and look for updates on the book often
2,OK - but not what I thought,The book gave a basic overview of gardening but it did not offer the information above and beyond what I already know. It was just o.k.
2,"This is great, if ...","If you've got great soil (or the money to buy it) and lots of rain and sun and otherwise perfect gardening conditions and no pests, and if you're so OCD that you really Need each of your vegetables separated by a little white line, you will wind up with gorgeous vegetables in a gorgeous container following SFG. If you have lousy gardening conditions, SFG isn't going to help much."
3,I recommended it to a brand new gardener,"Although I recommended this to a brand new gardener with a track record of not tackling anything hard, I wouldn't recommend it to many others. As others noted, Mel writes like an infomercial guy. I think I get why -- get new people to try (or retry) gardening. But, it sure gets old. Despite that and some factual inaccuracies, it was still a fun quick read. Try not to pay full price to avoid disappointment, though."
3,good for new gardener,"I thought this book would be more unique. I did learn more about spacing my plants. and if you have very limited space, the idea is unique. but i have a bit more space. it seems like a lot of work for a small garden."
5,A Great Book,"A great book! My husband was thrilled to receive it, has everything he needed/wanted to know and more."
2,"good info, too proud","i appreciated the author's gardening experience and am looking forward to trying the method. however, it was tough to wade through his self congratulatory tone and repetitive self praise for developing the concept. i found the charts very useful for spacing and planting dates. his website is also full of testimonials without any balanced critique of his book and method. if you can stomach the arrogant tone of the book, there is some good garden wisdom to be gained."
2,"8-page pamphlet expanded into a ""book""","Square-foot gardening is a simple concept - to grow veggies in 4'x4' raised beds, with wood dividers on top of the soil creating square-foot blocks. The chart on page 109 is helpful. Put this chart together with the first sentence of my review, and you have the square-foot gardening concept. Expand this concept to fill over 250 pages of fluff from the author tooting his own horn, and you have this book. I'm glad I didn't buy it but only checked it out at the library. I won't be buying it, either. If you are a very beginning gardener, you may like this book. Anyone else - instead of this book, I'd recommend the Vegetable Gardeners Bible."
4,Valuable Info...Especially for the Novice,"I live in a townhouse with limited space. While I read the reviews for this book, especially the dissatisfaction of finding certain soil components, I decided to purchase anyway. AND I AM GLAD I DID! If you can read a book and ""adapt the concept"" to your situation, then you will love the way this book is layed out. I don't expect to replicate everything 100%, but I also do not expect to ""re-invent the wheel."" I like this book because it lays out a great design that can be adapted to your personal situation. I am new at gardening, so it has been a great resource to get started, and I can see the mistakes that I made last year (my first attempt). Glad a friend recommended the book. I would recommend this to the newer gardeners, to the veterans...ya'll have probably already read this."
5,All New Square Foot Gardening,This is my vegetable gardening bible. It contains more inovative ideas than any other gardening book I've ever read.
3,Much better than CD1,"This review is for the version in the picture. Firstly te tracks are Alright (radio edit, vocal version, vocal dub, DJ excursion version).This single when compared to CD 1 is quite good, but still nothing brilliant. You get the radio edit here which cuts out the amibiant intro. The Vocal Version and Vocal Dub are quite good remixes, they keep the integrity of the original but just adds another layer of funk to it, quite nice. The DJ Excursion Version is pretty ordinary, just a looping drum beat which at 6 minutes goes for about 6 minutes too long.If you like the song alright and want to hear good mixes make sure to get this single rather than the Todd Terry remixes one!"
2,Superb picture but doesn't last.,"I've had great praise for Sony products in the past. I've had my tv about 3 years and the quality of the picture was excellent.Under 3 years, the picture tube is shot. The tv repairman commented that many customers had the same problem. The warranty had just ran out. I'm going to look at other brand of televisions."
5,An easy fun introduction to your telescope and the moon,A well written 'how to' for novice astronomers. The book describes pieces of the telescope to seas of the moon in a organized fashion. Chapters are broken out as views of the moon and each attraction is mapped with directions. Historical anecdotes accompany each chapter and give good perspective to what we are viewing. The author respects the reader- there are no excessive words and he assumes intelligence. It makes you want to know more about the moon!
1,Bad phone and service,"AT&T recently started promoting this poor-quality phone for its pay as you go plans. The phone is compact and light, but has terrible reception and voice quality. Web reviews also reveal it breaks very easily. My cousin's broke after a week and she had to get a replacement. She could also barely hear on the phone. AT&T's service is really lacking, and coverage is sporadic even in big cities like DC and NY. I personally recommend you check out Virgin Mobile's prepaid plans, which are cheaper and they have much better phones to choose from."
4,"Ahh, vintage mid-80's metal at its best (or worst)","With songs like ""Gorgar"", ""Heavy Metal (is the Law)"", and ""Metal Invaders"" this album is in the same vein of such greats as Witchfinder General, Piledriver, etc..... Can be pretty rockin' at times if the singer's falsetto doesn't bug you. However, if you're a death metal fan or if you're a bit too serious about what you like than stay away. (I listen to it all, personally)."
1,Stay away if you are coming from the Keepers,"If you bought the Keepers 1 and 2 and going for this one, then stay away as this one is nothing like the masterpiece Keepers. This one is a trash."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Before the Beatles recorded classic albums like ""Sgt. Pepper"" and so forth, they started with insipid ditties like ""Love Me Do"" and ""Mr. Moonlight."" Helloween also didn't really hit their stride until the two ""Keeper"" albums. ""Walls of Jericho,"" with its garbled vocals and poor instrumentation, illustrates that perfectly. This album is only useful as evidence that music groups can indeed improve dramatically: Helloween simply wasn't ready yet. ""Keeper Pt. I"" was the next album, and boy was it fantastic! Listening to the two ""Keeper"" albums today, though, makes me feel kind of sad when I think about what ultimately happened to the group after their heyday. It would be great if the original Helloween + Michael Kiske got back together again."
3,Not a Biography,"If you are looking for a biography on Joseph Smith, this is not it. This is a book about the doctrine that Joseph Smith restored/taught. The title is very misleading. I gave this three stars because I wanted a biography on Joseph Smith from a reputable source. The title suggests this is a biography. There is no info on Amazon about what this book is actually about, no search inside, nothing. Very disappointing."
2,Once Around,"James Horner has written some of the most magical,beautiful and moving scores that I have ever heard. Once Around is not one of them. Firstly, there are only 4 cues of his music on this cd, running less than 20 minutes. Much of this is made up of the big band sound that listeners of Horner's Cocoon:The Return might find familiar. However there are some restrained, melancholy tracks to be found particularly the final track ""A passage of time"". James Horner is a musical genius and in my opinion, is one of the finest composers of film music in the world. He is capable of much better than this and has proven it with Legends Of The Fall, Titanic, Apollo 13, Glory and many more. Check those scores out instead and buy Once Around only if you are a die hard Horner fan (like me!!)."
4,old school,"This is not an ""how to"" book but an insightful investigation into the medium of drawing. Written before the digital turn, Hill intelligently, articulately, and throughly analyzes the process of drawing/seeing. For those who still have the ability to concentrate on something for more than a few minutes and would like some intellectual underpinnings for their practical pursuit of drawing I suggest giving it serious consideration."
2,not as described or in photo,"photo shows teacup with saucer. this is only teacup. first surprise. description (at time of purchase) read ""made in England."" product reads: ""made in China."" Amazon guarantee resolved the situation."
1,Think twice about paying good money for this item.,I have been on the lookout for this for some time now now and what a huge disappointment. Whilst the movie is quite entertaining the transfer from film to DVD is abysmal and one of the worst I have ever encountered. Absolute rubbish and a total disgrace!
2,Very Poor Production Quality,"This movie has a great cast, but this copy is the worse I have ever bought from Amazon. I will not buy another product from Synergy Entertainment. The color is very dull. The quality of the production takes away from the viewing of this movie. It is not clear and crisp, it has lines and is distorted."
5,Joan Collins at her BEST!,"This long forgotten Gem is one of the best films starring Diva Joan Collins. Many viewers might find it rather dated, filled with cliches and Dynasty-like dialogue but it's quite interesting and infectious from start to end. The film goes on for a long time, it was originally shown on TV as a mini-series...Recommended."
1,Sins,After reading the reviews I ordered this set of 3 DVD's......When I rec'd them none would play? I had to return them and was sorely disappointed to learn I could not get another one that would work???Wah!!!
5,I read this great book twice in two weeks,"I have read my share of historical fiction, military nonfiction and sci fi. A friend of mine who graduated from West Point told me that one of his military tactics professors had been suggesting this book to cadets for years. He read it and has been suggesting it to his friends. This book is a jewel on so many levels. Who could come up with the idea of a text book from a class from an alternative future? I looked into it and Sobel had written several real text books! This alternative history has a text book feel, but is far more interesting than any text I have read. I like this book so much that I bought a couple more by Sobel, including his Coolidge book. I give this book my highest rating. I bet I'll read it again in a couple of years."
3,Not sure what to make of it,"First CD is awesome, all the songs I remember from Kylie. But the second disc is odd.. it has partial songs.. never heard an album like that before. And the liner looks ""photo-copied"" like the company distributing it is making it in their garage.."
5,"Kylie is a neglected talent, in the US at least.","Anyone remember Kylie? You probably remember her ""Loco-motion"" at least, which is included here. The first CD is 22 of her songs, most of which are excellent. The second is 50 songs strung together for the most part, although there are a few slight breaks. The first 34 songs are all strung together as a single song, and the last 13 are strung together as well. I'm not sure why the 3 songs in between have been seperated... but it's not so bad really. A super singer, and this is a super CD!"
5,Kommence your Kylie Kollection here...,"Now that Kylie has kracked the US, we Yanks have a lot of katching up to do. Jump start your Kylie krash kourse with this album which kollects 50 of her foundational hits. You don't get the wealth of wonderful mixes but you kan find those later once you've learned the basics and found your own favorites.Kylie has not sold 30 million CDs and outsold Madonna konsistantly in the British Isles just because little girls and ...boys like her. She's done it because she amazingly sells CDs across all demographics. In her British koncerts, this fan range and follower scope is evident...Katch this girl, she will out-legend Elvis and Edith Piaf. Mark my words."
3,why are all depeche mode's new singles missing much of the vocal?,"The mixes to go for on here if you're looking for a dance track are the two Jacques LuCont mixes. Both the vocal mix (7:55) and the dub (8:02) have about the same amount of vocal! Just snippets of lines from the song, but both mixes are different, and have a guitar sample that is quite reminiscent of classic New Order. The Goldfrapp mix (4:43) is a trippy mix with no drum track except for a very short industrial slam at the end. The bitstream spansue mix (7:26) is a trippy electronica mix---very messy, with the vocals drowned in effects. And finally, the Telex remix (3:28) is a short moody full vocal mix with a mellow rhythm track, reminiscent of the Violator days."
3,Depeche Mode of old?,"This extended CD single has 5 mixes of ""A Pain that I'm Used To"". I especially liked the first one since it reminded me of older remixes of their tunes. Nothing on here which screams ""buy the CD"", though. I bought it because I've got just about everything the group has done."
3,Shorter than imagined,"It does its job overall, however this is a short floor lamp. I'm a man of about 6'3 tall and when assembled this lamp almost reaches my chin. Also the base for light bulb and the hard white plastic shade do not touch leaving about a 0.25 inch gap of space."
3,Ariante Torchiere Designer Floor Lamp,Overall this is well made except the post sections are too easy to disconnect. I would not recommend this for use in a home with children due to this design.
5,Stunning!!!,"These lamps were extremely easy to assemble, only took 2 minutes for each one. Very attractive looking in our living room and gives off the perfect light that was needed in the room. I ordered 2 of them for our living room and have gotten many compliments from guests on how pretty they are. The price is phenomenal."
1,These are not as described...,"The description clearly states:-Brass plated finish-Ivory plastic shadeyet both of these statements are untrue. The lamps I received are black with white plastic shades edged in gold.For the price, I wasn't expecting high quality, but they should, at the very least, match the given product description.So, unless you are looking for a black lamp with a gold edged white plastic ""shade"" (not a bronze & ivory lamp) this is NOT the product you want to buy."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"This lamp was priced at a steal, and it looks a little cheap. However, it lights up a room well, and for what I paid for it, I'm very happy with the purchase. You will be too if you don't go into it thinking you're getting something that can pass for any kind of elegant."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS LAMP!!!!!,"THIS IS THE WORST LAMP!!! It also states it's in a brass finish and the one I received was black. It was also so poorly put together that instead of opting to go through the return hassle for the $10.00, I decided to place this lamp where it really needed to be....in the trash!!!! This lamp is no deal and I would not feel safe having it anywhere in my home!!!"
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought one of these and had one of the metal solder points break off the socket as I was screwing the light bulb in. This apparently caused pretty good short, as it tripped the breaker for that whole room. It's not that upsetting though... it's about what I would expect for a $13 lamp. I honestly think these are decent for the price... just be careful with them: they are pretty fragile."
1,"Piece of jank, broke on arrival.",It's piece of junk. Hard to get it out of the box and broke on arrival. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GET IT.
2,cheap quality,"Very flimsy plastic quality. I guess you get what you pay for, but I had never seen a lamp with this type of bendable, cheap plastic. If I had known, I would have spent another $15 to get a better quality one."
3,Serves it's purpose- needs a switch option,"I knocked this over and it broke. The touch sensor doesn't work anymore. I tried taking it apart... I don't know who I thought I was : ) I couldn't fix it. It would be nice if this had a manual switch option on the pole somewhere for just this reason. I now have to unplug it to shut it off or turn it on... Bummer. Also, the shade is pretty cheapy looking."
4,For the money!,"For the very cheap price, I think its a bargain! It looks really good, the shade is plastic but classy looking and has a nice long chord...........It puts off a bright but soft light, Im very happy with it, and you cannot beat the price of this item!"
4,Good enough quality for the price,"We just needed extra lighting in kid's room, and it does its job.It's pretty sturdy.The shade is plastic and does look as plastic...Golden trim on the shade has a tiny gap/opening which you'll need to put in the backside if you care.Overall we are happy with this lamp for its price though we wouldn't put it in the living room for its cheap look."
4,cheap lamp - but does the job!,"This lamp looks great for the price! I knew paying so little for a lamp I wasn't getting anything super fancy but it does the job. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone that just needs a simple floor lamp. It is a decent looking lamp and again for the price, you cannot complain. I haven't found anything close to this in price anywhere. Good quality for what you pay."
1,Stopped working on the first day,"I brought this lamp with not much expectation as the price is not much. When I opened the box I was happy to see the heavy body of the Lamp. The Lamp also looks good, but when I tried to fit a bulb in the Lamp, the switch broke down and the Lamp is no more working. I wish the internals of the Lamp were as durable as the body appears."
3,Plastic Shade...,"Plastic Shade on the 2 lamps I received were warped and looked pretty cheesy, but for the price o.k."
4,Ariante Torchiere Lamp.,"This is my second unit. The first one lasted for quite a while until the electrical components quit. But, for the price you really can't beat it."
1,Eh,"This lamp is horrible. Looks nothing like the picture. Wasn't as tall as I though it to be. It is heavy, the lamp bowl was wider and more round, which does not show in the picture. Price was great, but other than that...I'll pass."
4,Made during WW2 action film.,"The move was made during WW2 (British film) about the convoys bring food and war materials to England and the war ships that protect them. Many scenes were actually shot during convoy operations using real ships. Considering the age of the film, the quality is not too bad. Acting is typical of this period with a propaganda message that ""England WILL Prevail"". Production quality is not up to today's standards but considering it was filmed during wartime with limited resources it is understandable. Good actions sequences and the quality of the film stock is pretty good. Overall a pretty good film and worth watching."
5,Want to see your obituary note?,"Nabokov poses a question about who really is each of us. A very absurd and beautiful story about the relativity of perception: maybe the one that Hermann thought that was very similar to him, was completely different. Have you ever seen a man that somebody tells you that is very similar to another person, and then you see that it's completely different, or vice versa?Haven't you ever thought about killing your own personality in order to be someone else in another place? Haven't you ever truly loved somebody because of its nice characteristics, but truly hating its defects? Haven't you ever used somebody?A very despairing novel, with Nabokov's mastery to make you feel as the protagonist, mocking at common human interrogations and desires, but in the very human contradictory way."
3,Contempt,"What happens when Nabokov writes a murder mystery with no mystery? _Despair_. Not bad, but a Nabokovian take on a conventional tale. He often writes repugnant protagonists, but he makes them compelling and sympathetic. This is not the case here, in my reading. Hermann someone I wouldn't want to spend time with in a room, so even the 212 pages of text were a little much. There is little in the way of plot or characters to recommend the book, but stylistically Nabokov hits his stride and makes the novel compelling just for his language.However, a caveat based on my emotional response. Nabokov's writing feels often as if it was written with a sneer. This is hard to quantify but an feeling that comes across to this long-time reader. This sneer is written on his face and embedded in his prose. I'm not sure if this is a sneer of arrogance or contempt; maybe it represents both. I'm also not sure if the contempt is for his readers, his critics, or himself."
5,great piece of literature,"This book is really hard to get into, but once you push yourself, you'll really get into it. Nabokov is an amazing writer. Every character is just an exploration into the depths of language. Also, he really gets into the mindset of his characters. Thats why the writing in this book seems a little cold, a little distant...So if you are up for something different, I would recommend this book."
4,Hermann's trouble.,"It is a short novel with one main conceit; Hermann cannot recognize himself. It is a good point, succinctly and stylishy put."
3,NOT the original score,"This is not the original score used in the film. That score, by Chaz Jankel, is sadly locked in a vault somewhere. And that's too bad, as Jankel's work was beautifully melodic and very befitting of the film. Zimmer's work, apparently once considered for use, was not used. Yet somehow, it was released as ""inspired by the film"".That said, this work by Zimmer is neither his best, nor his worst. It contains two long pieces, with swelling music of symphonic keyboard work, and Pete Haycock's electric guitar. At times the music is dramatic, and at others, bombastic. Recommended for hard core Zimmer fans only. For those just getting into his work, other scores (The Rock, Black Rain, etc.) are much more worth looking into."
2,Please note this is not the amazing music used in the film!!,"This album is very misleading online and take into account that this is not the same music that the movie K2 offers. It has a brief intro with the same solos but it doesn't even hold a candle to the film. Instead of heart stopping guitar, it's filled with goofy keyboard music that niether flows nor keeps the listeners intrest. It's no wonder that this album wasn't used for the actual film!"
2,Good Alternative - Wish you were here,"As far as i can tell one cannot access the music from the movie anywhere however for fans of the original score i can only say that when i first heard ""shine on you crazy diamond"" by pink floyd i thought it was the K2 soundtrack. I now have the album ""wish you were here"" and i highly recommend it as an excellent alternative to this. ""shine on you"" is stark, intense, eerily similar to the climbing montagaes of K2. The rest of the album is reminiscent of blade runner. check it out."
1,Not even close,"The original soundtrack (if you listen to the movie with your eyes closed) well, some of the mtn ascent scene music was as mesmerizing as Pink Floyd's epic Dark Side of the Moon. Really deep. Really cool.This is like another band got slipped into the Jewel case...The similarity between the movie and this? Both had guitars. That's about it. Save your money.PS I like Hans other stuff, particularly Gladiator and Lion King among others, so this is not against him."
4,Give or take...,"Although the movie music is still on the film, this cd is a small part of Hans music. The music industry should issue the actual music from the movies. The movie is great but actually talking to Jim Wickwire's wife about his actual climb on K2, it was awesome. The CD is different but, enjoyable if you have a real good imagination."
3,works good; but big,This underwater noise maker works great. We were diving in Roatan and my wife used it to get everyones attention when she spotted an eel. The only draw back is that it is larger and heavier than I would have liked.
3,Mr. Krabs,"My 3 year old grandson loves Spongebob! He has all the ty beanie babies, Mr. Krabs being his last to obtain, and lines them up on the couch each evening to watch Spongebob. He takes them in his bag to the babysitter each day and occassionally they eat dinner with us in a restaurant!"
4,Mr Krabs,"I bought this for my 4 year old. She loves it to bits but now I get stuck having to do Mr Krabs' voice all day long, lol! It makes her laugh."
4,Going Against The Grain . .,"I'm going to go against the grain with this one. I found DEAD SILENCE to be an enjoyable movie. Sure it's done by the same guys that brought us the 'SAW' trilogy, but here they're showing us that they have versitility. I really liked the gray wash on this movie, and I had read that it was a tribute to the Hammer films. Now the film did have a little suspense, but did anyone expect the ending of it?"
5,Dead Silence,"I just bought the movie and I also went to see it at the movies. I have to be honest with you. This is the SCARIEST FRIGGIN MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN in theatres! and yes I do watch alot of scary movies, but none of them have ever scared me like Dead Silence. all the scary movies I've ever seen only scared me when something pops out out of nowhere or something happens really fast but in this movie they had like every scary element to keep you scared the whole way. Especially when the dead silence starts and every noise goes quiet, it that feels like when you are about to drop down a rollercoaster really fast, it's like they warn you that something really scary is gonna happen and it does. I still haven't seen it at home but I don't think it's going to be as scary anymore cause I'll just watch it on normal TV with no surround sound"
5,dead silence,"This movie was really good, kind of reminescent of S. Gordon's Dolls (great movie if you haven't seen it), and it will definitely have you rewatching to see how some of the scenes went down after you watch all the way to the end (you'll know what I mean)."
2,typical,typical doll movie. just a bore for me. I'm not really a horror guru though. I just didn't like it.
3,OK..But not that great,"I have to admit, it is a jump out of your seat movie at times when it has its moments, but, the movie with lack of acting and poor ""in and out"" plots and a stupid ending makes this movie a rental at best..go find a better horror movie than this one, only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do."
2,Dead Silence-DVD,"The DVD was so scratched up, I couldn't watch most of it. Think twice when buying from this seller."
3,Dead Silence went dead,"I bought this in high expectations since it was made by the people of SAW (which was AMAZING). Leigh Whannell is one of my favorite movie writters but, no offense Leigh, but you did not do a great job on Dead Silence."
2,The Saw series rock-I don't quite know what this is--waste of theater air??,"Dead Silence is a creaky gothic horror by the writers who introduced us to the dubious pleasures of the Saw franchise. James Wan and Leigh Whannell use those potent props the ventriloquist's puppet and an old nursery rhyme to piece together a gruesome tale of supernatural revenge. (How stupid..) Unfortunately the cast are so supernaturally dim that it's impossible to care about any of them.This is admirably surreal stuff. And the sensual pleasure in watching this kind of horror movie depends entirely on your tolerance for ear-splitting jolts of shock. In the end, though, I wanted my money back.BILLY WAS THE BEST ACTOR--THAT SAYS A LOT SINCE HE IS A FREAKING DOLL.."
2,dummy please,"I almost turned this off a few times due the lame actors and leaps in logic. But staying with it paid off a little. I still would have to say thumbs down. There are some good parts, the lady villain is way creepy and the doll itself is too. The death scenes are probably the most disappointing and how they arrive to these scenes only enforces the characters stupidity. The main good guy believes this dummy doll killed his wife (horrifically) so then why is the idiot driving the doll around town not in the trunk!! And propping the creeped out doll by his bed before sleeping? SORRY! First order of business is to send the that freaky doll down the river.The ending almost saves this movie but by then I hardly cared."
4,"Dolls, Dolls, Dolls","If you have a thing with movies to make you afraid of toys, this is one to add to the collection. It's creepy. The acting is rather good. All of the actors did a good job. The direction was good. It has a creepy ending that I'm not going to spoil for you. ;-) If you like a good scare or just a good creepfest with a macabre feel to it, this movie definitely has that."
5,Scary!,"I am a horror movie fan, I will pretty much give any horror film a chance. I really enjoyed this movie though. It's something about haunted puppets that scares me. This is like Goosebumps night of the living dummy only 100x's SCARIER! My first time seeing it was in the theatre and it definitely got some jumps and screams out of me. If you love horror then you'll like this."
5,Great Movie,"This movie was great. I would like to thank the writer and director for putting together a true horror film. The story unfolds very carefully, but it will continue to keep your attention."
4,A Good Creep Out,"Ok I Liked This Movie Alot..It Reminded Me Of An Old Time, Vintage Horror Flick..Kinda Like An Alfred Hitchcock Movie In My Eyes. The Only Thingi Didnt Understand Is What The Difference Was Between The Unrated EditioN And The Rated One..I Watched BotH And Saw No Difference..Anyways..If Yoru Lookin For A Good Old Fashioned Creep Out Flick Than This Is It"
3,DEMONIZED DUMMIES OF DOOM...,"No, Billy the ventriloquist dummy isn't all that scary-looking. Still, I did enjoy the beginning and ending of DEAD SILENCE very much. As for the middle part, well, it got a little long and drawn out for me. I don't particularly care for Donnie Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher), and he did nothing spectacular here. As I said, I liked the weird, NIGHT GALLERY-esque beginning a lot. It made me think the rest of the movie would be a nice late night treat. It was the mainly un-frightening mid-section of DS that lowered my expectations. However, that ending was a true jaw dropper, much like SAW (by the same folks) before it, I was left w/ a smile on my face. So, my advice is to watch the opening closely, do a crossword puzzle or sudoku during the middle part, and stare wide-eyed at the climax. It sort of makes the whole thing worth while..."
2,its ok to scream this movie sucks,"This movie is comedy at best. The story is about the revenge of a ventriloquist against a whole family line. If you scream when the ghost is around she will eat your tongue. LOL. The plot was very weak/predictable, and the acting was lukewarm at best. I laughed so hard when the really long tongue came out of the clown doll and licked the main character (similar to the first nightmare on elm street). Overall this movie is not good. You may get a laugh here and there but other than that, don't waste your time. Once again thanks blockbuster online for saving me a rental fee."
2,Saw this at its Theatrical release and had forgotten that,"To be quite frank this is not a very good movie at all. Never have been a fan of haunted doll movies much less haunted puppet movies. The only decent one I have ever seen was the now quite old ""Magic"" featuring Anthony Hopkins...made sometime in the mid to late 1970's. Ann Margaret was also in that movie and it is old enough that she still looked pretty darned good!This movie is simply poorly done. Mr. Wahlburg does a pretty good job but the movie itself simply doesn't cut it for me.....didn't like it at all. Not suspenseful, not scary....just rather poor in just about every respect."
3,Not bad,My hubby was told about Dead Silence. We never heard about it before then. So hubby went out and bought it. We watched it that night. It wasn't bad. I expected worse. But it sure isn't the scare's movie out there. At less for me. I think the end was funny. Jamie managed to not scream threw the whole movie till the end... lol.
2,GO TO ANOTHER MOVIE INSTEAD!,"DEAD SILENCE WAS A VERY SLOW AND BORING MOVIE WHICH WASTES THE TALENTS OF ALL INVOLVED! MAYBE WORTH A RENTAL...BUT NOT WORTH A THEATRICAL VIEWING!I BELIEVE THAT WITH A LITTLE WORK,HOWEVER, THE FILM COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD!IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE FILMMAKER'S HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO!"
4,Creepy!,"If you want a thriller to enjoy on a late-night/weekend, one that will catch you off guard with some genuine jump-out-of-your-seat moments, this movie should do the trick. Although maybe not quite in the same league as Mario Bravo's best works, this movie does remind me quite a bit of his films. While the subject matter - a haunted ventriloquist dummy - isn't exactly original, director James Wan manages to pull this off and infuse it with a creepiness I haven't seen in the movies in a long time...well maybe since Mario Bava. So, don't let any negative reviews dissuade you from at least renting this. I definitely recommend ""Dead Silence"" for scares & creepiness that harken back to late 50's, early 60's horror films. And make sure you watch this on a surround sound system for the best effect."
3,Okay for what it is ....,"If you are looking for a silly horror diversion, this one fills the bill fine. Some weird gore, decent sets, a couple of decent jumps, and a very silly premise. It's improved by the actors who take it much more seriously than it deserves, but for a short horror flick it does have a few fun moments. Harmless fun. How old is Amber Valetta anyway?"
3,"""True Bloods""Ryan Kwantan{Jason}staring role","I wanted to see a film with ""True Blood""star ,Ryan Kwantan.""Dead Silence""is not bad,but I wouldn't want to watch it again.Ryan does a great job,and the ending is scary especially if you are scared of creepy dolls coming to life,and its not a happy ending for Ryan."
4,pretty decent..,I realize movies are very subjective....I liked this movie..not giving it 5 stars because there is room for improvement but I found the premise a bit spooky..and dolls always freaked me out as a child and so did dummies...(and clowns LOL).. I thought this was a good movie...(I also liked House of Wax..which I find similiar in the weirdness category..)
4,Scary little piece of work......,"I love a good horror film----not wild about slasher/blood and guts...but rather a ""real"" story and somespooky/well-done images. This is NOT a hollywoodproduction...there is a definate ""B"" movie qualityoperating under the surface, but it is decent in it'scategory and offers up some really creepy scenes...Idon't scare easily, but the evil female ventriolquistand her creepy dolls stayed with me for several daysafterward. If you want an entertaining little scarymovie with more spooky images and effects than bloodand gore...this one should fit the bill."
2,Just bad.,"This movie is irritating as soon as it begins. The tacky post-production looks like something a highschool student who just learned how to use filters would do to make their movie look ""cool."" The stop-motion and excessive use of very unrealistic ""old-movie"" grain overlays in the introductory credits and in transition scenes throughout the movie draws attention to itself in a way that completely distracts from anything they're actually showing on screen, and makes the images themselves more abstract and much less scary. The fifteen-year-old who edited this REALLY needs to learn some restraint.Aside from that, the plot really isn't worth commenting on. It's filled with holes, and the ending defies the little logic that was there.A few of the scenes of the dummies, particularly the ones set in the past, are genuinely creepy. That's pretty much the extent to which this movie is any good."
3,Dark.,"I enjoyed this movie. It was boring at first, and kind of hard to get into, but it grew on me. I Liked it, but it wont be one that i will watch again. Not as action packed, as some other ""Killer Doll"" Movies. The Characters are very unlikable, and the movie just has a depressing feel. If that makes sense. Stick with Puppet Master..."
2,Well the town is creepy,"Just like House of Wax, good set but not so great of a movie. I rented this movie instead of buying it and im glad I did. I have a habit of buying movies before viewiing them. Dvds can be purchased for the price of seeing one in theaters or a rental at the video store. On to the movie, story is pretty weak. I dont see how people enjoyed this been there, done that story that had alright speical effects. Overall, its a renter and not buyer."
3,Thumbs down...Not scary,"My daughter saw this at the movies and said it was sooo scary, well I beg to differ. It was ok but not very scary. I liked Wrong Turn better. I am glad I didn't pay to see this at the movies. I only bought this because she wanted it."
1,This movie is DEAD. Zero star.,"This movie is DEAD. It contains no suspense or horror at all.The first 10 minutes stirred up my curiosity a little bit. After that, there's nothing worth seeing left.The special effects are worse than those of tv shows. Here are some examples: Walls crumbling, wooden floors broken and fell to ground, big doll rolling its eyes. Do you think they're scary? I don't!The detective acted as a child not as a trained professional.Pet Sematary, 28 days later, Slither, Cabin Fever, and the Grudge are still the only ones on my list of Best Horror movies of all times."
3,You call that acting?,"The dummy in this movie is a better actor than pretty much everyone else in this film. Aside from that though, the film actually exceeded my expectations. Though nobody can deny that it's derivative, the director and writer manage to introduce a few original and exciting concepts (in terms of style) that save the movie from being complete dreck (they also stay far away from CGI! Yay!)Still, if you're looking for real horror, I wouldn't pick this. If you're looking for a fun, light horror movie, this one should be high on your list."
3,"LOVED THE STAGE AND MAKE UP, JUST THE SCRIP IS LAME!!","I just rented this flick and watch it, only wants to see this flick, because of saw director, and was a ghost story.I really liked the makeup, special effects, stage looks and the way they made it and cast. Real eye catching colors and style & old fashion 70 & 80s ghost story looks, such as I loved.But the scrip is the stinker, almost the end, that cop never comes down with backup..Never see the police dept..And the main actor goes almost places and spooky places for long while nothing happened to him after a lots incidents!. Just alots of flaws here and there, make the flick some type of a joke & unbelievable..Kind of cheesy, love the cast and the old woman and dolls real good deal, just scrip was lame and screw up the whole flick & lost interest ! Anyway guess just a rental worth nothing more. C+"
2,Eh...,"I mean, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't special either in any way. Wondering if it was worth the rental fee."
1,Not worth it,"I found this movie to be a confusing mix between Darkness Falls and The Blair Witch Project, although nowhere near as entertaining. A creepy premise that has been done a million times and an ending that will leave you saying ""What the?"" and then going back to see if you missed something in the plot. The ending made no sense and seemed to be what the writers decided to do after they had written themselves into a corner. If you watch the alternative ending, then the theatrical ending made much more sense, so why the editors decided to cut it is beyond me.Skip this one. It was not scary and the characters were stupid. I will give this movie one star though, because the actress who played mary shaw was very creepy and her eyes still haunt my dreams."
2,it isn't good movie...,I saw this movie on DVD and then this movie isn't good. This movie was horrible and disgusting. I really hate the couple of scenes. I don't like it.
1,waste of time...,Thought for SURE I'd like this one-----NOT!!!!! Kinda seemed like a Saw rip-off in a way. Cept SAW movies are 110% Better!!!!! Dont waste ur time like I unfortunately did..
2,No ninjas and little death,"Contrary to all indications this single-feature movie consists only of ""Deadly Duo"" and ""Ninja Death 1"" is nowhere to be found. This is especially troubling because Deadly Duo appears to have some sort of huge ensemble cast, making it impossible to tell if/where Ninja Death would begin without watching the entirety of Deadly Duo first.Save your time and money, I assure you Ninja Death 1 cannot be found here."
2,Baabul,"Baabul Dvd has sound issues, you can't hear the dialogs well from the middle, picture quality is good and sub tiles are Ok."
3,"Nice sheets, but...","These aren't really worth 45$ I thought a premium brand sheet would be a little nicer, but it really does just come down to thread count.Considering the quality and softness of the matching queen sized comforter (99$), I expected a little more."
1,terrible terrible book!,"This is really one of the worst textbooks I was ever confronted with. The texts are all so stereotypical, the grammatical explanations are absolutely not coherent. I was really glad that I knew French before starting this course. The book didn't teach me anything. On the contrary, it unnecesarily complicated everything."
1,Do not buy,"Completely worthless, the head phones barely lasted two days before breaking. I will never buy a product from this company again."
4,Brick in two parts,"Part one by one author traces the history of brick construction, as an art historian. Part two by an architect discusses the technology--from the mining of clay deposits through the molding process. Very thorough and easy to read."
1,What's up with the pricing?,"Seriously, why does this part cost over $13? I just put a brand new 3-hole punch, with better paper capacity, into my cart for $24. It's ridiculous that to replace all 3 punch heads would cost nearly $40 (66% more than a new hole punch). The pricing makes it difficult to justify doing the ""green"" thing. I also find it amusing that the manufacturer recommends replacing the punch heads annually. Why would anyone do that at this price point? It seems like opportunistic pricing to me."
2,"Maybe good for others, but not for me","This product may help in lightening scars, but for someone like me, who has acne, this soap just doesn't do anything productive. I get more acne than there's time to fade a spot. If your skin is relatively clear, but you want to lighten some scarring, this may work. I wouldn't know. But if you have an acne problem, you'll just keep getting more spots that aren't clearing with this product.I also have some pock mark looking scars on my back that, thankfully, are not due to acne and I've tried using this soap on those scars, too, hoping to lighten them some, but I haven't seen any result for that either.It may be one of those products that only work well on certain types of skin. I'm biracial, white and black, and black skin tends to scar and keloid very easily, which mine does, but that rarely happens with fair skinned people, so maybe it's a better product for people who are more fair."
5,A superb evocation,"Reading David Margolick's book was a fascinating and intensely visceral experience. The writing evokes the subject, as if the book were a lyrical score telling the story behind Meeropol's political poetry that became Holiday's song. The author transports you to a searing episode from our past that still smolders today. I was grateful to have found and read Strange Fruit and it is powerfully imprinted in my memory."
5,I Love This Album!,I used to have this on vinyl LP but it got ruined. I no longer have a record player so it would be pointless to buy it now. There's mono copies of this album floating around on the internet. I wish stereo copy was available. Great album though.
3,Sarah Bernhardt Lite,"If a young girl came to me and asked what books were available regarding one of history's greatest actresses, I would not hesitate to suggest this book by Iris Noble. I was expecting a book written for adults, however, and thus I was disappointed.This book is very superficial and zips over significant aspects of Bernhardt's life. Much is assumed and more is ignored. All in all, a disappointment for those of us looking for a more comprehensive read."
4,Thomas Halloween movie,"I bought this for my son who loves Thomas, but he is scared of the new animated Thomas so he won't watch it. I watched it once without him and thought it was ok."
2,Incredibly poor binding from the publisher,"The book is basic, and not badly written; friendly and clear advice and instruction for the would-be surfer, but it's a slim volume-and here's the rub (and the reason for only 2 stars): the binding of this trade paperback was the worst I've seen in quite a while-it fell apart after one read-through, with whole handfuls of the sewn-in pages cascading to the floor. Most defintely NOT what you'd want in any how-to book."
4,begining surfers please read this,"This is a good general book. It doesn't answer everything and it doesn't prepare you for everything, but if you are a beginner it is a must read. Every sport has certain rules and basic techniques that you need to know to play them, and that is exactly what this book gives you"
4,Really Great for Beginners,"I bought this books because I have been living on an island for seventeen years, desired to learn how to surf for most of them, but didn't have anyone to teach me. All I can say is this book was more than helpful, with great, detailed step-by-step instructions ranging on topics from what kind of board you want to what waves are best to figuring out how to stand on your board. The illustrations were great and it was a good kick-start of background knowledge and safety that I needed to know before I hit the waves."
3,"gets you surfing, you want to be surfing",a very good book for someone new to surfing. It doesn't answer all the questions but it helps.
5,great and affordable,"I've had this product for months and it has not let me down. I normally connect my ipod using the line out. With my sony mdr-7506 headphones the performance is great. It is not leaps and bounds better than stock amp inside ipod, but it definitely helps with bass response and sound-stage. this is not marketed towards audiophiles but it a awesome product. very low THD, and gets plenty loud with mid to low impedance headphones.Although there are some features i wish it had such as a mono switch."
4,Rewind,"Rewind is a very good book. It has very good description (example: ""...a very prominent nose. I had to make very emphatic movements...""). It had very good sequencing. I could follow along with the chapters, knowing were Peter was at the ending of the chapter to the following chapter's begining. The book was very realistic in its science-fiction genre. I could understand how Peter got his second chance and how he tried to change his parents beliefs and his own actions.The ending of Rewind was very disappointing in how I could predict what was going to happen next. It didn't tie up the events in a nice ""bow"". It didn't quite squence smoothly in the ending. In my opinion you would wan't to read this book. It is very descriptive and sequences along pretty well. The ending, though, wasn't written the same as the rest of the book. It steered off of the sequencing just a little by jumping around form one place to another. It was a little hard to follow but is a very good story overall."
5,The Exciting Book,"I think this book is a great and and confusing book. I think this book is confusing because you can't tell what try (to save his life) he is on. I think it is a great book because it is very exciting. This book is about a boy who puts on a play for his parents and his parents say that they don't like it and so he gets mad. So he runs out of the house, into the road and gets hit by a car and dies. He gets eleven hours and forty - seven minutes to save his life. Well he .. . Guess you have to find out if he lived or died when you read the book."
3,another chance,The book rewind by william steator was a book about a boy named peter. He got ran over by mrs.hazelton and he was watching his funeral.After watching his funeral a voice starts speaking to him and tells him he has a chance to go back to change things so he woulndn't die.So he goes and attemps to change things.But before he dies his parents tell him that he was adopped becuase they thought they couldn't have kids but then she gets pregnant and they tell peter the truth. And that is why he runs out and gets ran over. But he gets another chance and he if doesn't change anything then he will really die.i thought the book was wierd but interesting. But over all i thought the book was okay. it hasn't been the best book i have read. Probably the best part of the story was when his parents was impressed and proud of him about the puppet show.By:David R.
4,Nikky Finney Review,I thought this particular collection of modern day poetry was well written. Nikky Finney's use of words had me feeling as though I connected with the the author. This book was very different from conventional poetry that I have read in the past. I personally recommend this book as an inspiration for anyone who has a true love for poetry.
4,Amazing Grace,"This is a form of outstanding writing that sould not go unnoticed. The cool and vibrant history in the African-American struggle of identity through which these poems have been written is truly amazing. With poems like ""shark Bite, Frog Legs, and ""Ain't to Proud to Beg"" these works become a meanful treasure chest of Generation Y's future. A good read!"
3,Round,"I read all of the poems in the book and I had mixed feeling about many of them. I am sure the Nikky Finney is a great poet because of all of her recognition, but I could not understand some of the poems. I put this problem off on myself however, being a person that does not read poetry frequently. For a beginner trying to learn how to write and understand poetry some of the poems were a little difficult for me. All of the poems did however, have a flow to them, and they sounded nice. They were just hard for me personally to understand. I am sure that for someone that has more experience with poetry, the collection of poems would have been wonderful and perhaps even moving. I did enjoy some of the poems such as ""Hate"", ""Assam"", and ""Sign Language""."
4,interesting read,"i got my first taste of nikky finney through this book. the themes of family and home seem to be ever present in this book; the imagery in most of her poems are what grabbed me and made me connect with it. her descriptions of her south carolina home made me reminisce about my own childhood home in rural va. i was put off by the sheer length of some of her poems (like coda, for instance). however, the feelings and memories other poems evoked made me like the book as a whole.best poems: ""mean nina"", ""hurricane beulah"", ""sign language"", ""sex"" and ""fishing among the learned"""
2,Study guide for teachers seen better,"ETS produces 68 pages to help review 4 years of college. These types of study guides are more like table of contents. I gave it a four because I have seen books like ARCO that list 25 sample questions which is really insulting. Anyway, why would I need Music when I study Chemistry? There was real content and a two hour practice exam and an amazing bibliography. Study guides are usually dry as the saharah but this was real information. I also got the special education book from them. That was superb for classroom management. Any elementary education teacher will have students they mainstream. It was definately worth the money. I'm a happy customer. They also have other fields such as professional Knowledge. I think they also do seminars."
3,Just Okay,"John Farnham is a jewl to Austrailians and they love him and his music. I can't say the same for AMericans. His music is okay, but nothing I would run out to buy in the future. He has some solid songs from the RAD soundtrack - music that is hard to find. This was the only album you could get it on. Other than that his music is very average at best."
1,Yawn,"Others may like it,especially ballet lovers.But me?Blah!Yawn too.I had this book years ago as a young teenager,I bought it because,although I dont have a strong passion for Ballet,it is kinda pretty and sweet,you know..But i mean what a dull book.So many times I picked it up and started from page 1,but its just so boring.I think it was an 80s thing..Think of the early Sweet Valley Highs,the Sweet Dreams novels and also this one.The style of them all is BORING!I think authors have a catchier way of writing now.And that is all for now.Signing off,bye."
4,Solid CD. A must for the true action music fan.,"Thank you Mr. Poledouris for Conan I & II. II is shorter than the first, maybe a little too short. What's there is pretty good though and matches up well with Conan the Barbarian. Conan I is a little more of a roller coaster to listen to. This one runs a little faster, but the waves are a just a bit smaller."
4,Not so Powerfull as Conan the Barbarian but good...,"My Favorites here are ""The Katta"", Approach to Shadizar"", ""Crystal Palace"".I am missing the Powefull stuff from Conan the Barbarian here but the other Tracks are also good too.If there will be a 3th Part of Conan and i hope thatBasuil Poledouris will again make the Music for it then i hope that the Maintheme of Conan will come again.If you allready have the ""Conan the Barbarian"" Soundtrack you can Buy this to have all but the first on is the Best."
1,"No Soul, very dissapointed.","Just recieved the cd and threw it straight on. To my regret it was terrible, Lacks all the Grandeur of the first. I was willing to forgive it's short running time if it contained any of the magic of the first sound track but alas it did not. All the base is missing and the overpowering trebbly chimes are irritating. You must purchase the 1st Movie cd it's one of the greatest sound tracks ever but stear well clear of this one."
2,Can't believe it was composed by the same person!,"The score/soundtrack to the first Conan film is a feat of genius and stands as one of the fantasy film genre's best musical compositions.Inasmuch as the film ""Conan the Destroyer"" was a lesser effort than its predecessor, it seems as though Poledouris felt that he could use less of his composing talents on the film. There's very little that is as grandious as the cues from Arnold's first foray into Conan territory.If one wants to simply have the companion piece to the first film, then this purchase might be necessary.For other fans of film music, it is a buy that should be avoided."
4,"Pretty good, but missing a piece.","Upon my second or third listenting of this CD, I noticed what was missing -- the palace music. When that chick is about to be executed, there's that very mellifluous tune in the background. But it's not the soundtrack. I have no idea why not, because it's very good. It might be on the Conan The Barbarian CD, or maybe Basil didn't compose it.Crystal Palace is the best track of the lot and the second track is good, too -- the love song. Crystal Palace worked fabulously with the film... Arnold smashing those mirrors in syncopation with the music? Hoo-doggie! Buy this disc."
4,"Get ""Conan the Barbarian"" Instead","This is an excellent soundtrack with some very beautiful, and very powerful songs. I have only given it four stars though, because it is merely a dim reflection of the soundtrack to ""Conan the Barbarian"", just as the movie ""Conan the Destroyer"" was a mere shadow of its predecessor. This album is much shorter than ""Conan the Barbarian"" and some of its songs are almost the same. Furthermore, the first and last tracks are almost identical, thus decreasing the album length further. It is still a good soundtrack, but I would only recommend it to owners of the ""Conan the Barbarian"" soundtrack who are thirsting for more."
4,Missing essential music,"I could have easily given this 5 stars but the opening main title was butchered beyond belief. I ended up copying the soundtrack off the movie to a cassette and then adding the CD to that cassette. The CD does bring out musical instruments that can't be heard clearly in the movie, but it could have been AWESOME if they had just dropped the whole first 15 minutes of the audio of the movie directly on the CD. The sounds of the whips snapping and the screeching of the horses during the credits and Mako's dialogue were too good to leave out. Seems like they did the same thing with RoboCop...the other soundtrack by Basil P. Left out the title theme or inserted small segments of it in other tracks."
3,Not- so-efficient,"This may not be the best map book for road travel. The major roads are marked, but the State maps are small and do not have details. The major cities of the United States are covered and mapped, but not in detail for a road traveler. This atlas can be used for the general planning of a trip, but final planning has to be with a full size road atlas."
3,"""high wind"" flag coming apart after about 3 weeks of use","My flag is coming apart at the seams after only a few weeks ofoccasional use. We do get 25-30 mph winds here nearly every day, but, heh...this is a ""high wind"" flag, right? Its a decent flag, a decent value...but this is the first flag I've had that has literally come un-sewn, not just fraying away. Nothing special, I'd say."
1,Flag coming apart and no response from supplier.,"One year-ago, I purchased a polyester, high-wind flag from sevenbrothersmercantile thru Amazon. Recently, I noticed the flag was coming apart at the seams in the striped section. As this flag is advertised as ""high-wind"", I expected it to be more durable than average. When I e-mailed 7-bros (via Amazon) 3 wks. ago about this, I explained that I lived in a not-so-windy area of Florida (i.e.,not on the coast) and the flag was hung in partial shade under several large trees. I asked about their policy for resolving a defective product inquiry. To date, I haven't received a reply.Maybe I'm too gullible expecting 7-bros to live up to their advertising hype--nevertheless, I really expected this product to last at least 2-3 years before coming apart. I rated this flag a one-star product since it only lasted one year."
1,Less than 3 months old & shredding,"Purchased flag at the end of February, less than 3 months old; and seams have pulled & fabric is shredding. No return policy."
2,Not for High Wind,"These Colors are not for use in high wind areas like Cheyenne, WY. The flag is essentially shredded to the degree it no longer meets the standards for display, in approximately 30 days. It was replaced this morning. I display the Colors 24/7 w/illumination; the brutal Cheyenne winter winds were not kind. In a calmer climate this may well be a worthwhile choice."
5,Excellent US Flag,This flag is obviously well made and the fabric is an excellent weight. I expect to fly it proudly for quite some time.
5,Dad's Replacement,I inherited my Dad's old flag which he dislayed every Holiday for 50 years.Our WY.sun and wind soon wore it out. This flag's quality should allow me to fly it for my Father another 50 years.
4,Beautiful Quality,"I paid a little extra, but the fabric and durability is well worth it. It was a gift to my Father, and he was more than impressed that he got this as a replacement flag for his old tattered vinyl one. It hasn't been up too much yet with it being winter months, but it will look great and will be proud to have it displayed."
1,READ THIS - What you order is not what you get!,"I order this polyester flag and received a nylon flag. The vender, WinningGifts, as listed above, told me they don't sell a polyester flag and I got what I ordered! I hope others did not unknowingly receive the nylon flag when the paid for a quality polyester flag."
2,Beautiful at first but does not hold up!,"I bought this based on the reviews it got. I need a flag that can stand up to wind since it is almost always windy here. I was impressed when I first received it because the quality seemed great. But after only 5 months of use, the flag has started to come completely unsewn at the bottom and corners. It IS a beautiful flag, but my other flag lasted for 5 years and this one lasted only five months. Now I'm in the market for another flag!"
2,Disappointed,"This flag was purchased to fly where it gets quite windy in the afternoons. It looked great and seemed very sturdy in the beginning, but it did not last any longer than the flag it replaced (about a year) which had printed stars and stripes. It ripped along the stripes. Will buy cheaper flags from now on."
5,Excellent Soundtrack,The music captures the mood of the movie and is wonderful. Traditional and classic pieces. Excellent purchase and arrived on time.
3,"OK, but not great","Howard Shore's score is good for mood music, something soft and pleasant for a candlelit evening, perhaps, but it lacks vigor, real drama. It is a disappointment, just like the movie."
3,Tom Savini is in this.,"As is Bruce Abott from Re-Animator and Bride of Re-Animator and so is The awesome guy who was in alot of Carpenter films and Cheech & Chongs Nice Dreams (i always forget his name) if these individuals were not in this film it'd make it alot worse. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a horrid stinker but it's not really awesome either. Cool elements in certain areas of the Script but cliche'd ones aswell obviously. As it stands its just a decent B-film directed by Robert Kurtzman. Good for a watch if you're a fan of the aforementioned actors as i am."
5,A great genre movie must see for fans,"This was the real gem! A small movie that really made most for it's budget. It was a great thrill-ride and a lot of fun. I have to admit that the basic story is totally Robocop rip-off, but still the movie knew exactly how to play the story and make it into something genuine and fun."
1,"dumb, dumb, dumb","This is a tired old rehash of Robocop, with not enough action, and not enough plot. The dumbest thing is that the heroine, who has been reanimated against her will, chooses to die near the end, but is in the next scene inexplicably seen putting flowers on her grave. Anything for a happy ending."
3,I was a little disappointed,"This one was a little bit of a letdown. This songs are there but the mix leaves a lot to be desired. It's way too heavy on pedal steel and drums and Mike McBrides fantastic bass work is almost inaudible. PayCheck's great soulful voice, while always raspy, sounds like he'd spent too many days on the road and he seemed to have trouble with his usual range. Still it's another one for my collection."
2,Buy The Moral Mind Instead,"I bought this book a long time ago, and it made sense to me, I based my politics on this viewpoint, until I read The Moral Mind. The morality in this book, and with most liberals, and for a long time me, is seriously truncated. Read the reviews on The Moral Mind, a book that will open your eyes to several dimensions of morals, which this lacks. It is why conservatives understand liberals, but liberals are totally confused about conservative positions. After you read The Moral Mind, you will begin to understand what conservatives are really talking about and you will begin to understand the false logic so prevalent in this book.I know this doesn't actually review this book in any depth, all I can say is save your money. I had also purchased Don't Think of an Elephant. It was interesting, but again, open your mind to a broader perspective--you don't have to change your politics, certainly no one book did that to me, but you will be a lot more savvy."
1,Scholarship? Really?,"""Christianity works by a moral accounting system...Immoral deeds are debits; moral deeds are credits...If you have a big enough positive balance of moral credit when you die, you go to heaven; if you have a negative balance, you go to hell. These general notions are shared by most forms of Christianity.""Wow. That's one of the grossest mischaracterizations of Christianity I've ever heard, let alone from a professor. One only has to read the Apostles' Creed, or heck, listen to the words of ""O Holy Night,"" to know how wrong Lakoff is. I think I sense a bias. I have no doubt Lakoff is a scholar; just not in any of the areas addressed by this book. I suggest he stick to Cog Sci and Linguistics; and peer-reviewing isn't a bad idea either."
2,The Premise is the Problem,"I found this book very shallow in its understanding of both political ideologies. While he has a good understanding of the liberal point of view, his conservative side is lacking considerably. As a conservative I found out I have been close-minded, hateful, racist favoring segregated neighborhoods, supporting of moral strength regardless of outcome, classifying morals not my own as evil and a host of other deficiencies which do not describe conservatives at all. The premise is the problem however, not his motive. Since he is a liberal, he views the world through his own moral compass, however conservatives do not view many issues through morals. Facts and reality play a much larger part than morality. So while I cannot fault him for his effort, his substance was off the mark."
1,Moral Politics,"Received this book for Christmas from my unsuspecting daughter and even though the author, George Lakoff purports to be unbiased, the opposite is true.I thought this to be an interesting topic, but as an awoved liberal, the author is biased right from the get go."
1,Complete Rubbish,"Lakoff, once again ignores every law of economics and makes an emotional account for his view of the world. All flames and no facts."
4,great read,i am still enjoying this book and it really opened my eyes to the ways conservatives and liberals think alike and differently....i highly recommend it!
4,Moral Politics,I basically liked this book and thought there were many great points made. I think the author may be stuck a little too much on the strict father/nurturant mother angle though and unaware that a great many children do not grow up in this type of an environment and would not identify with this demographic.
5,A must read for understanding the Bush nightmare,This is a must read for every American trying to make sense of the Bush administration and the conservative GOP nightmare.
3,Reprint not original,This is a fine reprint of a 1911 book. It is a quality reprint but it is not the original 1911 book as it appears to be listed. The date shown indicates 1911. This is not a book from 1911.
5,Best all-around sock I've ever owned,"I bought a 3-pack of Ultimax Running Mini-Crew socks eight years ago. I don't run but I walk 20-25 miles a week and do a lot of bike riding. These are, without reservation, the best athletic socks I've ever owned. They are extremely comfortable and they wear like IRON. After eight years of being worn every weekend, two of the three pair are showing some wear in the toe region. Not holes yet, although they will be eventually. I don't plan to ever again wear anything except Ultimax. Try them--I believe you'll agree."
1,Bad.,Bad. You only need The Saints first 2 albums and definately not this one. This is just a Chris Bailey solo album.
3,"Nice, but not great!","Some of the music, especially the main theme and the ending score are great, but much of the ones in the middle sound very similar and repetitious. I'm not sure if this is the same for others, but my Rudy CD doesn't seem to sound as good as the other CD's that I have. What I mean is that I hear static or ""white"" noise in the background that I normally attribute to cassette tapes. I'm pretty sure it isn't my stereo system since, again, other CD's I have do not make this sound. However, this noise is relatively minor and should not make too much of a difference...unless of course you copy the music onto a cassette tape or other media (e.g. MP3)...then it becomes a bit more noticeable. Anyway, the music is still pretty good."
2,repetitious,"This is quiet, harmonious music, but it's basically the same few notes repeated throughout. It was a waste of money for me."
5,A Great And Touching Job For Goldsmith,"At first I wasn't sure what king of job Jerry Goldsmith would pull off in a movie called ""Rudy"". I had no idea who Rudy was. When I first listened to it at a listening station in a music store in Miami, I was touched. I fell in love with it that I immediately bought it.Goldsmith was truly a master. He knew exactly what notes to use to reach our hearts and tell us what Rudy had to go through from being an average guy to a football hero. The theme from Rudy is simply beautiful -indeed one of Goldsmith's best main titles. And the training music -as heard in tracks like 'Tryouts' and 'Take Us Out' -is completely exhilarating.Jerry Goldsmith was fortunate to work with director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo because ""Hoosiers"" was also one terrific score. ""Rudy"" is definitely one of the best Goldsmith scores ever. You can't help but feeling exhilarated and touched by such great work."
5,Awesome!,This is a great score to go along with one of the best sports movies ever created. Jerry Goldsmith's composition of this great music really brings out the meaning of the movie rudy. great cd for a great movie. very inspiring. 5 stars for the great compostion of Jerry Goldsmith.
5,Oscar Performance!,"I can't believe this beautiful soundtrack did not get nominated, let alone not win outright. Forget the cheezy movie that it was linked to (Sorry Rudy! I know your a neighbor but its only a two-star movie.), the sound track should be considered on its own merits.My 18 month old son will not go to bed with out it. My wife, an Indiana U. grad, even loves this music. BUY IT!Thanks Jerry!"
5,One of a Kind,"I had looked for years for this soundtrack. After finally locating in on-line, it has a special place in our collection. You will always be glad to have this CD in your collection."
3,...,"The music is fine as far as it goes, but I bought the CD assuming that the stirring versions of the N.D. fight song and alma mater would be included on the CD. (This is the sound track, n'est-ce pas?) If the CD had been promoted as Jerry Goldsmith's compositions for the movie ""Rudy,"" that would be one thing, but it is advertised as the soundtrack. It is a ..."
3,For lovers of the move only,"If you loved the movie, this is really good. If you did not, don't buy it."
1,.................,"usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for ""legend"")but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too""forced"" for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(.)"
1,Is this pillow the standard firm 200- not clear,The item for sale does not match with the reviews. The ad is not clear enough for me to purchase the pillow.
4,"It works, but....","I've been sleeping on this pillow for about 3-4 days now, and I although it has helped my neck pain considerably, I find that I am unable to fall asleep deeply while using it. I end up switching to a regular pillow halfway through the night. Knowing this, I probably still would have purchased it, but perhaps I would have chosen the ""gentle"" version instead. I do want to say that the Tri-Core pillow is large and seems very well-made. It barely fits into my standard size pillowcase. I was impressed with its construction."
1,"Tri-Core Pillow Standard Support is a ""sham"" pillow","The advertisement claimed this pillow to be the ""highest quality cervical support pillow""; and the first two nights I used the pillow, it was great. By the end of the week, the fibers had shifted, and the pillow was lumpy and misshapen, and very uncomfortable. Some of the lumps being so hard, they were painful. And no amount of shaking or fluffing brought about a change. For the cost, I expect a pillow to be comfortable for more than one or two nights!Tri-Core Pillow Standard Support"
4,Tri-Core Standard Orthopedic Pillow,Was purchased for my wife. She was having problems with her neck. Doctors wanted her to sleep on her back. Regular pillow didn't work. This pillow allows her to sleep in confort on back which has great reduced neck pain.
5,Love It,I purchased this pillow to help with neck and shoulder tension that was leading to headaches. I have found it to be a great help and didn't have any trouble adjusting to the shape of it. I can sleep on both my back and on my side with no problem. I love it!
1,The worst customer service and a horrible side sleep pillow,"First let me review the pillow. The pillow is sold to provide good support for back as well as side sleepers. Although thihs might hold true for back sleepers, it is definelty not a good side sleep pillow. I used thsi pillow for few nights and was kept awake all night due to the pain ti caused I wanted to break in the pillow and bared the pain for couple of weeks but still didnt get better.Now as far as the customer service, I tried contacting them and asking them not for a refund but atleast an exchange to try one of thier other pillows. The response i got was ""we are not sorry about this because our policy does not permit refunds"" I never wanted them to be sorry except provide me an option if avaible! The customer service was very rude.I would strongly recommend against trying out this pillow if you are a side sleeper. Also keep in mind the horrible and rude customer service if you ever need it."
2,Too hard,This pillow is too hard. I understand you need it to be firm for the support but I woke up with my neck hurting. I read other reviews where people found it comfortable after a couple of weeks. I tried and tried but just could not get to a point where it helped me with my neck discomfort. I do not have a long neck so I found the pillow pushing my chin toward my chest while I slept. This pillow was not for me.
3,Okay,Good if you start to sleep on your back and then tend to move to your sides. This is just joining my ever growing collection of pillows I've tried to ease neck pain. Unfortunately no magic here for me.
4,Brady & Beaumont Meet,"I have always enjoyed all the Joanna Brady novels by J.A. Jance. I find her description of Bisbee, Arizona accurate. Her characters are realistic and interesting. Each story is unique. This book met all my expectations and then some. Because she has one of her fictional characters meet up with another one of her fictional characters from another story, I had expected that to be a little stilted. However, the story line flowed well. She was able to have part of the book in 1st person and the other in 3rd person without it sounding like an uncomfortable cut and paste job.Jance's inclusion of Sodium azide in her plot was educational and frightening."
4,Partner in Crime,"This is classic Jance --with a twist! Lots of action with maybe a bit too many reflective episodes of the emotional type! ""feelings , nothing more than feelings"" :>) You either like Jance or not. I can get past the dective with a heart stuff because there is usually something really happening the next page over!J.A.Jance is fun! I've read all her stuff."
3,Neither Fish nor Fowl,"If you're a JP Beaumont fan (I'm not), you'll find this too touchy-feely for you. If you're a Joanna Brady fan (I am), you will be clamoring to smack Joanna upside the head at the end for flirting with JP (and disaster). Left a bad taste in my mouth.The description of Bisbee is spot-on; visiting the town after reading this book, I knew my way around its Old Town area."
3,Slow and Disappointing,"I am a fan of Jance and have read all of her books for both the Brady and Beaumont series. This just didn't do it for me. I thought it was slow and I only continued to read out of loyalty. I especially didn't like the ""little moment"" between Joanna and Beau at the end. I thought it was totally unnecessary. I didn't enjoy how Joanna, who I always thought exhibited great integrity, treated Butch like a door mat. Where was her loyalty? I don't believe Jance stayed true to Joanna's character."
3,Enjoyed another J. A. Jance mystery.,"I've read all the books in this series. This one was OK, but didn't keep my interest like some of J. A. Jance's books."
4,Partner in Crime,"J A Jance has written a fascinating character in Joanna Brady. She is totally human but filled with integrity. The chemistry between J P Beaumont and Joanna Brady is electric.I don't know if I would have paired them together, as Jance has done, but it certainly made for some interesting reading. I am getting to feel that I really know the town of Bisbee, AZ and the people who live there. Purchasing Partner in Crime from Amazon, was an inexpensive way to continue my interest in this series. Tess B"
2,Where's the mystery?,"Sorry, but this one is a real stinker. The two detectives do little detecting but a lot of complaining about each other, until magically they are attracted to each other. Don't buy it. Sheriff Brady is in a bad mood from the first page, and doesn't solve any of her problems throughout the book. Beaumont does little more than complain about his rental car. Even the main criminal realizes the two detectives are stumbling around behind him so he obliges the story and conveniently kills himself by falling off a horse."
2,This really is overhyped here!!,"The story does not flow or capture the reader adequately, the relationship between the two main charecters (Beaumont, Bradley)lack real chemistry, i.e. quite stolid. No action, suspense, quite simply a dry appraisal of a crime. I was dissappointed as I got my review from amazon"
4,Partner in Crime,"J P Beaumont goes to the Southwest to help Sheriff Joanna Brady solve the murder of an artist. In the process he learns more painful truths about his late wife Anne. Jance's two detectives work well together although both have different styles. This book was somewhat contrived, and hopefully th author will get back to writing about J P Beaumont and his new job soon. Personally, I prefer the Beaumont series."
3,"I'm obviously the odd one out, but","I'm pretty well used to that by now. I was impressed with Jance's plotting, her descriptions and her characters. She seems to be a fine writer and I have no doubt that I would rate the book higher if I ever force myself to finish it. Unfortunately, my ""whine"" tolerance factor is set very low and everyone in her cast -- aside from two very minor characters -- enjoys large doses of whine with their cheese. I held on through chapter four but finally bailed when I realized the situation was not getting any better; indeed, it just deteriorated that much faster. Good plot, good premise and well-written characters, just not anyone I'd tolerate hanging around with unless I were being paid for the trouble."
2,Stolid,"Dry appraisal of a crime, action and suspense is low. Author tries to be too subtle in charecter interactions. Ending leaves you hanging. Culmination makes you wish you had more. Definitely geared to a non bloodthirsty mystery audience."
2,Not at all impressed,"I had never read a J.A. Jance mystery before downloading and listening to this one. When I was done, I thought ""this is one mystery series I won't get into"".I found the Beaumont character more interesting; I got tired of Joanna Brady's home life. **Spoiler Alert**. I found the thrown-together romantic moment between Beaumont and Brady to be ridiculous because it came way out of left field. I immediately disliked Brady for potentially betraying her husband who didn't seem to deserve it at all. From the response of another reader, this episode was totally out of character for Brady, so I have to question the competence of the author.The mystery's solution is a let down and seems ""tacked on"". An adequate vacation read, but not good enough to make me crave reading other Jance books."
3,I wanted to love it,"I am a huge fan of Jance's JP Beaumont series, and I am a moderate fan of the Brady series. That being said I was not as thrilled with this book as I wanted to be. First off it is definitely more a Brady book than a Beaumont. I was almost half way through the book before Beaumont was introduced. This was not why I didn't like it, but was a minor disappointment. I felt this book went along smoothly, and then just seemed to fall apart at the end. It wasn't nearly as suspenseful as her books usually are, and I thought the ending had a lot of loose ends. But most of all I really disliked the focus on Beaumont's ex-wife Anne, coupled with the sexual attraction that seems to pop up out of no where. That seemed like something Jance threw in as an after thought and it really didn't seem to fit. Overall I would recommend this book to someone who is an avid Jance reader, but wouldn't want someone new to try this book first!"
5,magic,This is a true soundtrack in the sense that it follows the film and captures the moments beautifully. A lot of songs are small pieces so the overall length is quite short but definately makes up on substance. I own the DVD and every year i pick a night and open of bottle of wine and cook some asian dish and watch this film. It is like travelling in time and to another country. Both lead actors are flawless. The end sucks but as is the case...realism in a love story often reflects our own experiences. Excellent soundtrack. Excellent film. Wish hollywood would take note.
1,The Lover Soundtrack,The music is great but the sound quality is extreamly poor. I would not have bought this cd if I've known this head of time.
2,Lacking Content,"I suppose for [the money] I shouldn't complain, but this bookis really not that helpful. It does cover many models but only givesa ""quick and dirty"" view of each. It contains little practicle info for those looking for specific information. It barely touches on AD's, SDR's, or other maintenance problems. It skips many model years. It provides no information about what to look for in any one year. (Such as the infamous "" H "" engines in the 77-80 model 172's) The photographs are simply publicity shots and are few. If you are looking for a brief overview of all of the Cessna models, this book is for you. If you are looking for more specific information about a particular model or series, look else where."
4,Good Cessna purchasing primer,"Good for people considering purchasing a used Cessna single engine aircraft. The dedicated books for the 172, 152, etc go into more detail than necessary to help you narrow down your search. I enjoyed the book and refer to it from time to time."
3,It's just OK!,I was hoping for something visually stunning and I got it but the story had one small problem that Japanese studios always seem to miss. It went on for to long. If they cut out 4 to 6 episides and condensed that material into the rest of the show you would have something to really sink your teeth into. Other than that it's not bad!...
5,"Stunning, simply stunning.","This anime is, as the review title says, simply stunning. From it's rich animation to each individual character, it is perfect.The anime carries a dramatic tone from start to finish, but is punctuated by great humor, love, loss and breathtaking action. The story is well developed, and the characters even more so. You might find yourself with true feelings towards each and every one, from distaste to perhaps hatred for those of the Guild, to parental encouragement for Claus and Lavie. In my opinion, it is everything you could wish for in a television series, be it anime or live action."
3,its watchable,not all that great but good enough to watch and pass time. story is good but the animation is the best part. the intro is well done also
3,Great characters,"I loved the general story line; however, the story was slowed by overly lengthy posturing and battle sequences that detracted from the adventures of the three main characters. The art work was excellent with relation to the three children but fell into somewhat of a rut when they were not part of the sequence. I like it very much but have a tendency to ""fast forward"" or ""skip forward"" when the battles become boring."
4,Look toward the skies,Loved this series when it first aired on cartoon networks toonami. The art and the story are well done. Along with a classic cast of characters its hard to find fault with this anime. I can not wait for the second season to come to DVD.This is a must have for any anime collection
5,A well done and refreshing anime,"Last Exile is a wonderfully planned out and executed anime. It reveals what it intends to reveal about characters and the world and leaves the rest to your interpretation. Some people may find that frustrating, but I really enjoyed how everything- the characters, the places, even the structure of the world itself- were all treated as part of the story and the experience, not just facts to be rattled off or simplified to be easily understood. There is more to everything in this anime then meets the eye, some of which is explained as the story goes on, some of which is not. Piecing things together as the series went on was a large part of the fun of this show. Very notably, I was satisfied with the ending, something that I can rarely say about an anime series. It was fulfilling, but not tell-all.The animation is solid, the characters are intriguing, and the steampunk/sci-fi blend of technology is fun. I highly recommend this series."
5,Last Exile: World at War,"Looking for some new anime? Last Exile will send you through an exciting, fictional war story flown through the eyes of an orphaned aviator and navigator. Their brilliant flying skills and perseverance lead them through an adventure to stop a world war.This series has sharp action and graphics. Also, a strong naval and aviation theme dominates the action. As for characters, there's Steve Blum (Spike Spiegel), Beau Billingslea (Jet), and Skip Stellrecht (Vicious). In fact, the Blum and Stellrecht's characters coincidentally share a little rivalry in the plot. Kinda like in Cowboy Bebop...hint, hint).Overall, great storyline, action, and characters. The dialogue is not complex but simple enough to emit the strong emotions and points across. Everything is also progressively revealed, so there's a bit of mystery."
4,Great Entertainment,Last exile is fantastic anime eye candy. The visual content is amazing with a nice flair of steam punk. The story line is decent but the interactions of characters lack a certain flow. All around however this is well worth the buy. I would definitely buy this over again.
2,Very good sound quality but Very fragile,"I've adquired this product 6 months ago, and i have to say it's sound quality is very good. Good bass and very sharp sound.The active noise reduction circuit works well in low-band frequencies, but in high frequencies it is not mutch effective. It's perfect for airplanes, i can even listen to enya sounds and not hear the engine at all.The big CON's is that it is has already broken. The plastic material is very fragile and the structural design is very weak. there is a weak point there has already broken twice, and even supergluing it just broke again."
3,"Good Sound, Break Easily",These headphones are a decent value. The sound quality is good and they are very adjustable. The noise canceling feature works well and as a whole I was very happy with these headphones.HOWEVER the design on the piece that connects the over the head portion to the ear speakers is cheap plastic and cracked (on both sides) during very gentle usage. I used these only at work so they were not transported or moved at all. Basically using these on a day to day basis was enough for the plastic to crack after only a couple months. They are still usable but I'm guessing once the plastic works its way apart completely they will be worthless. I would recommend finding one that will last. Its sad because if I could keep using these I would be happy with them.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought these headphones after my brother used them with satisfaction until they broke. He told me you just have to be very careful with them. So given that they seem to be cheaper than any other brand of NC headphones on the market claiming good quality and comfort, I thought I would take the risk. It is a risk I learned from taking, but one that I won't take again, because when it comes to headphones (and most types of products) you really do get what you pay for. The sound quality is good without the NC feature and great with it, but the connection between the part that surrounds your ear and the part that goes over your head broke, seemingly all by itself, since I was extremely careful with the headphones. Now I know why the seller I bought these from didn't allow returns. If you want high quality headphones, you have to be willing to spend the money. I learned that lesson the hard way."
5,"Dr Ayshe Talay-Ongan, Psychologist","The truth and honesty in this sparkling novel, the simplicity and the eloquance of the author's language, and the depth of the images and insights are akin to an impressionistic painting...I sincerely hope that we'll see more from Ms Bidgoli's pen."
1,i wouldn't recommend,"I oredered this charger but they sent me completely diferrent charger. i purchased this charger because it has 12 dc so i intended to use it in my car, but the charger that i received can be used only on 110/240V. i am not satisfied with this and they should be more careful which items they ship. i could buy the same item for less money. also they charged me for shipping but shipping suppose to be free."
4,Not bad but not great,"This is not a bad charger if you can get it for under $20. The charger comes with a 12v car adapter and the AC adapter can work with both 110 or 220 volts though not automatically (You MUST set a screw on back of transformer). It also comes with a Europe plug adapter. The batteries it comes with are junk. You will be dissapointed if those are the only batteries you try. It charges at 700ma with either 2 or 4 AA's (350ma with AAA's) (you must set a switch for 2 or 4 batteries). In real testing it took 3 hours to fully charge 2000ma Eneloops. There are better chargers out there, but they will cost more. If you want the convience of charging in car and using overseas it should work ok, just buy another set of good batteries with it."
5,Excellent introduction,Dr. Albury's book is very good--a terrific introduction to the history of the Bahamas.
1,TWO of these went belly-up on me IN SIX MONTHS,"I bought one of these at Costco. Six months later it was dead.I figured, OK, bad luck. I bought a second one.It is now six months later and it died today.I haven't been doing anything strenuous with the players, just watching discs in my bed. There is no reason for them to have died like this - but they did.I've been scouring the web trying to find a Mintek site, but there is none. Forget any sort of tech support.Please DO NOT be fooled by the low price of this product. It is low-priced for a reason."
4,Region Code Free?,"I bought this unit specifically because a couple of previous reviews indicated that the player is region code free. This was not the case with my unit as I received it (read on to see how you can change that.) The Preferences menu does give the option of choosing from a list of regions. However, when I did this, the player completely ignored the new input. That is, regardless of the region I chose, it continued to play Region 1 (U.S.) DVD's and refused to play my Region 2 discs. However, there is a workaround (in the form of a series of entries using the remote control) that can be found at videohelp.com. When I used this ""hack"" and reset the Region Code from 1 to 0, all my discs played.I've only just received the player so I can't speak to any other technical or longevity issues - but I sure like the price!"
2,"okay, but poorly made","I had this machine for about four months, then it would not recognize any of the DVDs we inserted. I had to ship it off to Mintek for repair. It took about two weeks to get it back. Also, the door that is supposed to pop up with a spring is very weak and takes some coaxing to open. The image is good when it is working (like most all of these players) but the quality in manufacturing it is fairly poor."
2,"Good At First, Especially for the price but broke","I was initially drawn to this model because of the price. It is very inexpensive relative to other port dvd players out there. However, with low price comes lower quality. This became evident within 2 months of use. It simply died; stopped loading any DVDs. I returned it and got a toshiba, which was a little better (I had to return that model a few times as well). My advice, spend a few more bucks, get the better quality plyer unless you are looking for a disposable player that you are only planning on using for a couple of months."
1,Customer Service Attrocious,"We purchased a Mintek MDP1770 portable DVD player for our daugther a little less than two years ago. The product worked okay for a while, but then we had a problem where the unit wouldn't power up whether we were using AC power or battery. We tried contacting the Mintek customer service number several times. Each time we called during business hours and instead of getting a person we were directed to leave a message in the mail box. Twice when we tried doing this, we got a message that the mailbox was full. Finally on another try we left our contact information and a description of the problem and have never heard back from anyone at Mintek. I would strongly advise against purchasing a product from a company that provides this type of shoddy customer support. I can see from some of the other posts in this forum that I am not the only one to share this viewpoint."
2,Horrible Customer Service,"This was given to me as a gift. The owner's manual and rechargeable battery pack were missing. The case was the wrong size and the DVD player did not fit. All I wanted to do was exchange the kit for one that was complete. When all the 3 different stores told me they were out of stock and did not know when more were coming in, I wrote the company hoping to get the problem fixed. I never recieved a response and will never buy a MINTEK item again."
1,Not Just Junk-Worthless Junk,This was the worst item I ever paid over $200 for. Maybe got 20 hours of use-at most. Mintek Digital did not back their product. I cannot believe that the positive reviews did not come from employees or shills for the company. Sent the unit to be fixed. Told me it couldn't be fixed and I should buy a new one or pay $10.00 to get this unit back. I recommend all users contact the Attorney General in their state to file a complaint about this worthless product and company.
1,Stopped working after three days,"I read all the reviews for this player, including Consumer Reports, and was skeptical as the reviews were so mixed. But it was a good price, had everything with it we needed, and so I went ahead and purchased it on faith that ours would work. No such luck. After three days of use, the video screen went haywire and refused to display the movie. I didn't even bother with trying to get it fixed or replace it - I'm sending it back and plan to purchase another model. Note: a friend bought the same unit and hers works fine. I think it's a hit or miss product. Buyer beware."
4,"Mintek 7"" portable DVD player","This is the coolest thing to watch on long car rides, although battery life could be better (2 1/2hrs.) but most portable DVD players only have 2 to 3 hours battery life anyway. It comes with everything that you need, or well mine did, it came with a charger/ac adapter, car adaptor video/audio cables (that u plug into a TV), 2 pairs of headphones and a splitter, and a handy carrying case. I got it for 200 and it is really good, I reccomend it"
1,STAY AWAY FROM MINTEK,"If you read the reviews carefully, you will notice a pattern that the positive ones are written by people who have had their products for only a short period of time. The people who have owned their units for a while are the ones who are negative because they have learned how unreliable these products are. My Mintek died after only 6 months of regular non-abusive use. No wonder the warranty is so skimpy -- 1 year parts but only 90 days labor, which is 90 bucks plus shipping. It's not worth it considering you can by another unit for a little more. DO NOT BUY A MINTEK! You definitely get what you pay for."
5,Clarity and Sound Outstanding,"I've just unpack my Mintek. I was a little skepticle at first I was not familiar with this particular brand. So happy I took the chance. The picture is unbelievely sharp. It comes with its own case, 2 headphones as well as other accessories. I can hardly wait to travel with it. Shipping arrived before suggested date. The only bad side is the shipping was to be free, my credit card was billed. I'm sure Amazon will reverse this. I highly recommend this DVD,look forward to doing business with this vender again."
2,Got it-- sent it back,"I ordered this player less than a month ago and sent it back the next day. The picture quality was nice. The features and accessories were very nice too for the reasonable price point. However, when attaching the rechargeable battery pack I discovered the latching mechanism is POORLY designed and doesn't keep the battery attached. I checked to see if the latch was broken but that wasn't the case. It is just cheaply made of a low quality plastic composite and not designed to hold the battery securely. The battery moved from side to side and just fall off at will.I too like so many others appreciate the customer service Amazon offers and the return service in particular. There was a UPS driver at my door the very next day to pick it up and I was notified the day my credit card was credited on the return. This item was a loser but Amazon still sets the pace for efficiency and solid customer service."
1,Don't waste your money on this brand!,"Bought the 7"" portable for 199. Sept 04. It died this month. Returned for full refund,thanks to Costco's policies,and got the new 8.5"" for the exact same price. Used exactly 1 week, and now this one won't work either! Thoroughly disgusted. Will return this one,but now I refuse to buy the brand again. By no means was I rough with either unit. The refunds cashier told me that ""they get alot of them returned""."
2,Don't Give More Than a Year,"This is a great kit for travel and otherwise. We used it often for our daughter when we traveled on long trips. It worked great for a year, then completely died. These are great devices, but probably not worth the money due to the lack of longevity."
5,Mintek MDP-1770KIT 7 PORTABLE DVD PLAYER,After much research I bought the Mintek DVD player. For the money it holds an enormous amount of value. Our family lived overseas in France. We used this DVD player going back and forth from Europe to U.S. with no problems. I bought an additional battery to make the 7 to 8 hour trip. We could get at least 3 hours life of one battery and then popped the backup battery on. We bought this DVD player in 2003 and it's still working. Great picture and the audio is loud and clear enough that flight attendants have asked my little one to turn the volume down a bit. This DVD player is great!
1,Stops working after a couple of movies,"The picture, sound and accessories were great but the third or fourth time I put a dvd in, the player wouldn't spin. I tried everything. Eventually returned it and got the 8 inch model. The sales person said most of the 7 inches were coming back but none of the 8 inch models which are $79 more."
1,Another thumbs down on the Mintek.,"Score another Mintek 1770 with a screen that went black. I am single, middle aged, no kids, and treat all my electronics exceptionally well. No spills, no jolts, no abuse, so I figured I'd take a chance on a portable DVD player with questionable reviews on the quality. Dummy me. The unit never got taken in a car, so it was never exposed to extreme heat, cold, jolts, or power surges. One day I turned it on and the screen was black. Huge disappointment and I go away feeling like a sap for buying it."
3,Not bad,I still bought this DVD player even I saw so many bad reviews. I am using it for about couple days and so far so good. The only thing I don't like is you can charge the battery where you are using a AC adapter....
1,yep-junk,"I really wanted to like this player. The first movie it played was great. But after that, it has progressively gotten worse. First, the screen started to be distorted for a few seconds at the beginning of each film...now it is up to 15 minutes into the movie before it actually presents a clear image. second, once the movie is going it is fine with the exception of a few random flickers through the movie (which. But if it does make it through the majority of a film...don't be fooled. The laser track gets lazy by the end of the show and freezes on a single image. attempt to jump to the next chapter...and it chooses to go to the menu. the only benefit it has presently is to play some CDs (if desperate because the speakers are terrible) but if you want to hook it up to a tv, that seems to work fine and probably the only redeeming feature of this product."
2,"Great picture, poor audio","I recieved the MPD-1770 as a Gift, in Dec, 2005 and the unit was rareley used, except on short trips, Two weeks ago I bought a new DVD and decided to play it in the 1770. The picture plays fine, I don't have any audio, I can't reach Mintek or find anybody in the city where I live to repair it. I thought this was a reputable company, now I am wondering if they really stand behind their products. I really like the design just wish it had been more reliable. I'm glad that I didn't spend my hard earned money on such an unreliable product."
1,don't buy this dvd player,"i bought this dvd player after reading some of the customer reviews thinking it was going to be a great machine at a great price- i was wrong!!! the first one i got had to be returned because the battery would not charge. the second one i got seemed great- the battery charged and the picture was very clear. when i used the machine the third time, the picture was distorted and i couldn't make anything out. it took quite a few minutes of turning it on and off to get it to finally work; once the picture was clear, it started to freeze.i have now returned this one and amazon told me they won't send a replacement because this problem is more widespread than initally thought. spend a little more money and get a machine that works. this one is no bargain, it's just a headache!!"
2,Buy with caution!!,"I ordered this DVD player in the beginning of June. At that time, it had pretty good reviews. It seemed a value for it's price. Well...1) It took four weeks to arrive (The estimate said 1-3).2) The battery pack was defective. The customer service at Mintek (very personable...NOT!) said to mail it back. I wasn't in the mood to pay shipping on something that was defective out of the box. And God knows when they would actually send me a replacement.3) I went back to read the reviews since I ordered it, and it was obvious that this is not a quality product. I didn't want to keep it and wait for when the display would go (like everyone elses).**I would not recommend this product, but if you purchased it and it is still within 30 days, Amazon will take the return. You'll have much more luck with Amazon, than with customer service at Mintek**By the way, I just ordered the Panasonic LS50."
4,Good So Far,So far very good for the price. I have it since summer 2004. Picture quality is good. The car kit is working great for keeping the kiddies happy on long trips. Battery life has been longer then advertised. The only thing keeping me from giving it Five Stars is the Aspect Ratios. This is not a wide screen player unless you want to stretch your video into godawful displays.
1,Can't Believe I paid for this thing!,"I bought one for my daughter for Christmas right around Thanksgiving, of course I did not give it to her till Christmas. She was not allowed to take it out of its box till after we moved on January the 8th to our new home, because I didn't want to risk damage in the move. Then after it was opened and charged, it was used maybe 4 times before it froze up and would not play anymore. I called Mintek, and wouldn't you know they only have a 90 day warranty from date of purchase. I am going to have to shell out more money to fix it!!!! I feel totally screwed over for my 170 bucks. The thing is still sitting in its carry case in a closet waiting on me to decide to fix or go out and buy another one! I will never buy another Mintek anything. If they can't stand behind their product, they will never get one more dime of my money!"
1,Junk!,"I own the 7"" model. Being a deployed soldier, many others around me also own Minteks. The PX sells them.The hinges on my player are completely severed. The wiring harness is holding the screen to the base. The 5"" models do the same.It's not that I don't take care of the player. For a few months I replaced it in the factory styorfoam and kept in the box after each use. I eventually invested in a quality storage case for the unit. It's kept inside a building; I don't go into combat with my Mintek, or anything.The price of this player simply wastes money you could spend on a quality one."
2,Disappointed,I bought this DVD for my grandchildren for Christmas. I got it at Kohls in November. Everything worked fine for a couple of months and all of a sudden no sound. I don't have the papers on it so we couldn't take it back and I would like to know where we can have it fixed.
1,Stay Away - Inferior Product,"This thing died after 4 uses. Company wants $60 to repair. No thanks, I'll give another company my $60 on another product. You'll be sorry!!!"
1,BAD PRODUCT-DONT' BUY ONE OF THEM,"I bought a Mintek around January 2004, it quit about spring 2005. I didn't have an extended warranty for it. If anyone is going to buy one of them, get an extended warranty, it's my opinion that it's junk. I spend about almost $200 on the unit, it didn't even come with a car adapter. I had to buy that from the Mintek company. You can't find anyone to fix it after the 30 day warranty goes out. My unit really went haywire, the disk door wouldn't open at times and the screen picture would flip upside and downside, the volume went out, and it wouldn't play most DVD's anymore. Do yourself a favor, buy a different model."
1,do not buy,"I received this for Christmas and it only worked for that one day. For one movie. Afterwards, the battery refused to hold a charge although I left it to charge for over 10 hours. The AC adapter only worked for a couple of minutes and only with the battery pack attached. The picture was great, but it's too bad that I was never able to watch a second movie on it. We returned it and received store credit (no receipt), but the store clerk said that Mintek products are always complained about by their customers. I do not recommend this product."
3,A very cute mouse,"This little mouse is extremely cute, but I do think it was a little over-priced considering the size."
3,Test yourself by finding the authors' errors!,"While this book does seem to cover the range of topics necessary for the CCNA exam, it contains a large number of errors, and questions and explanations that are incomplete or badly worded.Just reading the first two chapters was enough to make me put down the book and run back to my Todd Lammle books for a while, just to make sure it wasn't ME that was off-base (thankfully, it wasn't). Lammle is concise, explains well, and is, most importantly, consistent.Also, as others have mentioned, the book tends to be a bit ""out of bounds"" in a number of areas.Finally, why aren't the tests included in electronic format? For $40, I expect a CD. It's a shame when supposed purveyors of new technology training still produce only in a dark-ages format.My advice? Save your $, buy Lammle's books, and use online study resources. While this book isn't a waste, I simply didn't feel that I got my money's worth."
3,Advanced level,"After studying the study guide by Todd Lammle, I use this book for my practice. Wow, it is advanced level, it seems to be out of the scope of the basice level of CCNA.I would appreciate that this book contains these advanced questions. It really gives me challenge. But I just want to buy an exam-oriented practice book, I would like to get a book with many questions within the scope rather than many advanced questions out of the scope."
2,too much bad info,"I've found too many completely wrong answers in this book to ever recommend it. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, too much extraneous material that does not apply to the CCNA test. Not completely worthless, but a waste of time overall when better, more focused, and error-checked books are available (e.g. Lammle)"
3,Way too many questions not CCNA related,"I bought this book along with the Cisco Press CCNA book and expected to get some questions that would prepare me for the exam. It does that job *ok*, but there are *so* many questions that don't even come close to CCNA objectives. I mean that they were more advanced, several questions about ATM, X.25, Frame-Relay and even a few routing protocols that the CCNA doesn't even touch. If I was beginner who had little Cisco experience before, I would freak at some of those questions. The extra questions I think is just to perhaps add some filler space I guess. It seems most books from this publisher do not have as much quality as the Sybex, or even (shrug) Cisco Press. The CCNA is a lot easier than how this book may present it to be."
3,"Good Resource - Occasionally ""out of bounds""","I found this was a good resource for the CCNA Exam, in that it represented all the CCNA exam objectives and ""more"". This might be viewed as a plus if your objective is to move on beyond the CCNA to CCNP or CCND but for anyone focused on the upcoming CCNA exam it may shake your confidences as it is beyond the CCNA objectives and it is laced with inaccuracies. The fact that I could find these errors helped me to know I was ready for the exam. This book takes an unwelcomed detour from its own title. I recommend it only as a supplement to other good resources such as those by Todd Lammle"
2,Way above and beyond what you need to know!,"Sorry I bought the book. I could not even use this book. After reading the Todd Lammle books from Sybex and the CCNA Exam Cert Guide from Cisco Press, I started looking at these questions... Wow! where did they get this stuff... It was scary! CCNA is suppost to be a basic certification. These questions were written for gurus (and some of them may have trouble). If you like shock therapy, then this book is for you."
3,"Not Bad, But OK","Although the book seemed pretty complete when I purchased it, it was almost too complete. There were many areas of the book that focused on topics you will never see on the exam. The positive side of the book was that it gives the opportunity for others to quiz you with actual questions, even though many of them were innacurate and in some cases wrong. I would think the editors of this book could have been a bit more technical. Overall, the book is not bad, in fact finding the mistakes in the book and recognizing that they are wrong may be your key to successfully passing the 640-507 exam. My advice: don't make this your only study guide..."
3,"A good exam resource, if you have the time.","This book has most of the qestions you need to pass the CCNA exam. This is for those who want to explore all the basic knowledge of Cisco, not necessarily those who want to pass the exam. The explanations of the questions is written in detail, but often times not to the point. The format of the questions are somewhat similar to the real exam. A good suppliment but too much unecessary information."
2,More history than information,"I expect to see more information, reference rather than the history of US universities. First half are spent for the history and history. Even though I like the history, the author should put more effort in making comparison than fact."
5,Juices and teas improve life quality,"I have been involved with health issues for almost 30 years, and the information in John Heinerman's book is very helpful. The author tells how common foods and herbs can help relieve over 100 health conditions such as allergies, heart problems, gallstones, bladder infections, liver ailments, menopause, high blood pressure, warts, and yeast infections. The book is arranged in alphabetical order according to disease symptoms. For example, green tea was found to help heart disease in a Japanese study of men over 40. Total cholesterol was reduced and HDL increased. Many other disease solutions are discussed in the book, also. You'll be glad you bought this book!"
2,Not happy,"I really thought this book would show techniques in using both programs. There is pretty much only two tutorials (Chapter 2 and 3) throughout the book. The rest of the 8 chapters shows case studies and gives long bios of the people that created the work. If you are looking to really learn hands on techniques this is not the book. The CD is horrible, there are only two chapter folders that have scene files. The CD also contains a corny little quicktime movie of Alanis Morisette's video. Get the book used if you must have it."
1,This book is one huge resume,"I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this book. At least I got it used. This book is almost devoid of actual tutorials and hands-on learning. The first few chapters have some instruction, but the majority of the book reads like a compilation of resumes with stunning imagery. There are lots of pictures and in-depth biographies of industry professionals with very little tips on how to create the images included. If you are a new user looking to expand your skills this is not the book for you. If you are an industry professional looking to hire a skilled artist, this may be what you're looking for. I regret buying this book."
1,I should have read the review's of the book first !!,"The Book is just a info commercial at best, almost no tech help."
5,There's not much I can add...,"that the other reviewers haven't said, but I had to stick my oar in. I first saw this movie when I was 10 and have been in love with it ever since. The soundtrack was one of the things that really stuck in my mind. It was like mermaid music. Even at 10 I could appreciate the beauty and sonerous melodies. Everytime I hear it, chills tickle my spine and I get this twinge because I regret that I'm not in the garden with Mary, Colin and Dickon. The soundtrack incorporates a lot of violin solos and a lot of classical sounding music. I think there is really a bit of a Celtic flavoring in it too. Not that much, just a hint, kind of like a lemon slice in a glass of water. It really complements the movie through all its moods, you could even say it fits the book. There's not really anyway to sum it up except that this is enchanting, and soothing and it's just real GARDEN music. Buy it, you will be inspired."
3,Love the music but are sample length composures,"After seeing, The Secret Garden, I was enchanted by the music. I figured I would purchase the soundtrack. As you would expect in any movie soundtrack Audio CD, you would be able to enjoy listening to each full song or complete composition. It seems each composition is too short, or is a sample of what Zbigniew Preisner has originally composed for each song. The Audio CD is in order of the movie. It seems it has been organized in this manner rather than being able to enjoy the full scope of each composition; unless of course Zbigniew Preisner intended each song to be so brief.I still love the CD but would love to have each song in their entirety rather than split up in the CD?"
3,Beautiful...but....,"Listening to this soundtrack brings back the memories of lush gardens and gorgeous scenery...but there's too little of it! The pieces with the boy choir are gorgeous...but after a little, they all start to sound the same. And of course, we miss the last song, the song from the credits, for which I bought the album. So I'm not sure if I reccommend this album--there are some pretty sounds, true, but for 18 dollars it's a lot less than I expected."
4,linda ronstadt vs. sarah brightman,"It's definitely Linda Ronstadt who sings ""Winter Light"". I've downloaded both versions and it is DEFINITELY Linda Ronstadt."
2,BELLA MUSICA... POCA DURACION.,"LA MUSICA DE ZBIGNIEW PREISNER, ES SIMPLEMENTE HERMOSA, LAMENTABLEMENTE, EL TIEMPO QUE DURA EL SOUNDRTACK ES MUY POCO. ¡SOLO 30 MINUTOS! ADEMAS, ¿POR QUE NO INCLUYERON LA CANCION DE ""WINTER LIGHT""?EL TEMA DE ""COLIN TRIES STANDING"" ESTA INCOMPLETO, EN LA PELICULA SE ESCUCHAN MAS VARIACIONES SOBRE ESE TEMA, QUE DESAFORTUNADAMENTE NO APARECEN EN EL DISCO.OJALA Y EXISTA PROXIMAMENTE UNA EDICIÓN ESPECIAL DE ESTE SOUNDTRACK, POR QUE REALMENTE LO MERECE."
5,Very pleased,"I absolutely love the film, and for the longest time I desperately wanted the cd. Finally I had some extra funds and I got it, and it completely met my expectations. It's such a pleasure to listen to! Especially when awaiting spring. (Which I'm doing any month of the year). The unblemished voices of the children are like a pure voice for the soul. Definitely a cd to have in your collection!"
4,Nice and simple.,"The theory of Integral Equations (IE) is exposed in the framework of Hilbert spaces. The book is mainly oriented towards the theory of compact integral operators, partial differential operators and boundary value problems. It provides a complete treatment of numerous transform techniques (Fourier, Laplace, Mellin, Hankel, Hilbert). The classical Fredholm theory makes the object of a full chapter. The last chapter deals with the nonlinear IE. The book is written is a very nice way, very simple. Numerous examples and exercises are provided. Each chapter begins with an overview of the goals and of the results, which is really nice!This book is intended to be simple, dedicated to students. It provides a good introduction to the world of IE (see also Jerry, Introduction to IE with applications). Applications of the IE are to be found in other, more specialized books."
1,Shoddy craftmanship.,"Two outputs, but only one is component. Main logic consists of the Philips TDA8310 chip which is actually purposed for processing for picture-in-picture applications. Save some cash and invest in a higher-end receiver that does video input processing rather than buying this hunk of low-budget design. $50 in parts, tops."
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,This unit sucked ass. I say sucked because I had one and had to return because of false advertising and shoddy workmanship. Anyone who buys unit is an idiot and sucker.
4,Very helpful book even if you studied biochemistry years ago,"It seemed to me that the book was too detaled sometimes, but it gave very good understanding of methabolism and major pathways. Correponding chapter of Biochemistry from USMLE Step1 is extremely helpful to keep your knowledge organized. I would definitely recommend this book."
5,Excellent accurate material for a brief review of subject,"I reccomend this book to all foriegn doctors who are preparing for the USMLE. The American students will also find this and excellent review guide to brush-up their biochemistry even weeks before the boards. It is well tailored to the requirements of first and second year medical students. The book also provides conceptual explanations unlike many other texts, which merely relate the facts and attempt to support them with petty statistical figures. The illustrations are tastefully done; are almost self-explanatory, are accurately placed and appropriately sized."
3,okay,"If you liked they're first CD then you'll probably like this CD. I liked a couple songs alot ,but I liked they're first CD more. No offence"
4,The Calling II: Strength in following the same formula,"First off this 2nd release is not as good as Camino Palmera. But the music is the same, the lyrics are taken from different authors especially the lyrics as other reviewers have already mentioned however the CD is still a must to listen too. This CD is soft rock and The Calling have kept it simple. 'Chasing The Sun', 'Anything' and 'Surrender' are my picks from this album.The Calling still has some way to go before they reach Lifehouse's fame but as a fan of both bands I can see the Calling reaching that zenith for the two bands are so similar to style."
5,Everything I expected and more,"I bought this CD expecting it to be great, but I was blown away by the lyrics. They are very meaningful.Its one of the best CDs I have. I highly recommend this CD to anyone."
5,I'm impressed!,WOW! - what else can I say? Two is absolutely fantastic CD! I pity all you guys who still don't have it! I love every single song of Two! They just kick ass!
3,OH WELL......,"I WAS ABLE TO HEAR ""OUR LIVES"" AND IT DOES NOT REALLY GET MY ATTENTION HOWEVER, HAVING CAMINO PALMERO(WHICH HAD BLOWN ME AWAY) I BOUGHT THE CD IN GOOD FAITH(SIGH). CREDIT SECTION SHOWS ALEX ""RECOMMENDS BUYING THE FIRST ALBUM"" BECAUSE""YOU'LL GONNA LOVE IT."" HE IS RIGHT.THIS ALBUM LACKS THE UNIVERSAL APPEAL OF ""WHEREVER U MAY GO"", PASSION OF ""STIGMATIZED"" DEPTH AND PAIN OF""COULD IT BE ANY HARDER"". THE SONGS HERE ARE GENERIC TYPE OF ROCK THAT ARE OK FOR CRUISIN' ALONG JUST TO HAVE A SOUND WHILE YOU DRIVE BUT NOT FOR CHILLIN' WHEN YOU STOP AND PONDER ABOUT WORLD ISSUES HE..HE..HE... I GIVE CREDIT TO WHOM IT IS DUE, ALEX'S VOICE SOUNDED BETTER HERE, AT LEAST IT IS MORE NATURAL UNLIKE BEFORE IT IS LABORED. THEIR SONGWRITING, BETTER TOO. AARON AND ALEX GOOD LUCK, I AM OVERLOOKING THIS BUT I HOPE NEXT ALBUM WILL BE A BLAST."
3,"""Two""-(worth it) SECOND time they rock","It's very hard to top your first CD, and while ""Two"" as a whole is not as good as ""Camino Palmero"", the CD is still worth getting for the lyrics are much stronger than on ""Camino Palmero."" As a sophmore CD, we can see Alex and Aaron's creative abilities blossom despite the lack of some of their bandmates. A few of the songs on ""Two"" open like some of the songs on ""Camino Palmero"". Aside from the single ""Our Lives,"" the best songs on the CD are ""Things Will Go My Way"" and ""Anything."" The CD came out at the perfect time; I'm graduating high school in 2 days, and as graduation and college is approaching, ""Our Lives"" is the perfect song to sum up the events. Keep rocking guys, and come tour in NYC!!"
5,OH MAN!,"I just have to say that this is one of those absolutely fantastic CD's. As a band, the calling has changed my life and after months of waiting for Two to come out i was all set for disappointment, i mean how could anything be better than Camino Palmero? But Two is beyond anything i could have possibly hoped for. Everyone should buy it."
4,Better Than 'Camino Palmero',"Wow. This cd is just awesome. From ""If Only"" to ""Our Lives,"" this cd rocks! If you enjoy The Calling's first album, Camino Palmero, definitely go out and buy their new album, Two."
5,"PERFECT,AWESOME!!!!","I really LOVE it so much! It's worth to buy this perfect record! The Calling is a awesome band, and They are growing up more and more!!!! =)"
4,"Great start for round ""TWO""!","I thought the cd overall was great. There are two songs that have a different sound in comparison to the rest of the songs produced by The Calling but I guess it is good to try new stuff. It is nessesary to change in order to grow. A lot of songs on many other cd's tell of love gone bad/good. I really like how this cd sings about totally different things in life ranging from life and death in ""One by one"" to a night of adventure (if you will) in ""Surrender"". For the most part, I think there's at least one song that everyone can relate to; that's what makes this cd great!"
5,The Calling rocks!!! ;),"I just love this CD. It`s amazing and very (very) good. Their last CD ""Camino palmero"" is also very good and You should buy that record too, if You don`t have it already..:)Alex`s voice is soooo good :)I highly recommend to buy this CD!! You won`t regret it (I hope):D"
3,"Good cd, but wouldn't purchase it.","For those Camino Palmero fans out there, I'll be honest and tell you not to expect as much from ""Two."" I would rate Camino Palmero as 5/5 and Two as 3/5. Its not a bad album, its actually quite good, but if you are comparing it to Camino Palmero's standards, I don't reccomend buying it."
2,"Creed without the preaching is ""Weathered"" the 2nd time.","Joins Puddle of Mudd and Ben Kweller in the race for who can have the most dissapointing sophmore follow up to an awesome debut. Casino Palermo was full of catchy hooks, and near classics, such as Unstoppable, Wherever you go, and Adrianne. This time around, it's just a jumble of generic alt rock tracks, and not a memorable tune among them."
1,What a rip off!,"If you follow 'The Calling beware of their propensity to rip off other songwriters. For instance, on this album ""Anything"" was taken directly from Belinda Carlisle's 'Mad About You"", so where is the originality, the lyrics?"
5,Fantastic!! Go buy and you'll see!,"I immediately loved ""Our Lives"" but was blown away by the whole album. I expecially like ""Anything"", ""If OnlY"" and ""Things will go my Way"". Heck, I like them all! Go buy it, you won't regret it! You'll be investing in the album of the year!"
1,Watering can leaks,"The first watering can they sent leaked. I contacted them and they sent a second one, which also leaked. They have decided to stop carrying this product and sent me a refund. I would still like to locate this product....but without a leak."
3,Real Translation,The Odyssey by Recorded Books was translated by George Herbert Palmer. The Iliad was indeed translated by Fitzgerald.
5,"A good, interesting read for a classic","I read this book for its value as an ancient classic and to try to get a feel for the way of thinking back then, which obviously had much opportunity to influence the development of the modern ways of thinking. I was very pleased that the story also turned out to be a great read. I was surprised that the gods played such an influential role in the story, and the development of the personalities of the various gods is quite interesting. I appreciated that the book was written in prose and is also quite readable. Don't read the introduction before you read the book unless you would like to have the plot completely spoiled. This Dover Thrift edition makes this a great value."
2,"Prose, not poem format","I bought this edition thinking I would get The Odyssey in poem/verse format...instead I get a poorly phrased prose version. NO schools, at any level, use the prose version - only wasted $2.50 on this, but I also had to buy a REAL version of the poem to be able to have a copy to use for my senior seminar. Very disappointed."
5,"Clearly a ""Must Have""","This book is clearly a ""must have"" for anyone developing with VFE. Despite spending a fair amount of time on the VFE Tech Support Conference, attending 2 VFE DevCons, etc., I have found this book to be invaluable. In particular, I like the narratives on the Instantiation of the Application object and Form, along with the discussion of various key properties and methods of the major classes. To the extent that one spends time actually studying these narratives, properties, and methods in conjunction with stepping thru the code, I feel this will reap rewards in the form of better productivity and higher quality applications. For those who aspire to get some depth of understanding of this framework, this book is for you."
5,"A ""Must Have""","This book is great for both new users of the VFE framework and experienced users alike. Not only does it provide step-by-step guidelines for building your apps with the VFE framework, but it also contains numerous tips and tricks for experienced developers. A required reference for all VFP/VFE developers!"
5,No Bounce To The Ounce,"Shipping was prompt. Item arrived and is as described. A high quality product that I am very satisfied with.The only negative, it is a little difficult dribbling it to the hoop! LOL"
3,10lb medicine ball,"Ball is on the heavy side, especially for women. I would recommend either a 5 or 6lb ball. Ball size is great, if you are able to curl 20lb dumbells easily on each arm then this is for you. Otherwise go lighter to 5 or 6lb medicine ball or strengthen up."
4,One of the earliest Mushroom Model Magazine Specials...,"...the second offering in their Yellow Series.The book is 80 pages, square bound, in what I believe is called B5 size in Europe (6-1/2"" x 9-1/2""). The book has three major features. The first is a detailed description with illustrations of the differences among the E subtypes. The second are color ""walk around"" photos of preserved examples. The third are about 20 color profiles.All seems well done. The only issues I have with the book are that some parts are dated because research has uncovered much since the books publication (2001). The second issue I have is that the dimensions of the book limits the line drawings to 1/72nd scale. I prefer 1/48th. Most of the color profiles are to the larger scale.All in all not a bad book for a modeler but the general enthusiast has better options these days. Tracking down this out of print book is not really worthwhile."
4,Excellent Work!,"This books is the first book to compile information of invasive species that are a threat to native plant communties. The review for each plant is superb citing historical, physiological, and distribution information. I strongly recommend this book for anyone studying invasive plant species. This book will not be of much help the gardener, but it is incredibly helpful to the conservationist and academic."
4,An informative book,"This is a very interesting and informative book concerning some of the plants you are most likely to see in California's semi-urbanized wild places... that is, you're often more likely to see these plants than native plants.However, only a limited number of plants are covered, and there are quite a few very common and highly invasive species that I wish she'd included. This is a compliment to the amount of information she provides about the plants that ARE in the book: where the plant came from, how to get rid of it, how it propagates, various musings of someone evidently quite familiar with the species, and more.Also, there are a number of species that only occur in southern California, so if you live further north like me, this information is not especially useful."
5,prohibition is still effective today,"Once one takes a look at the context of the information it becomes somewhat disheartening to read. People were knowingly hurting others for the sake of greed and image.What disgusted me the most was not necissarily the gangsters or crime that this era created, but more to think of the stark injustices which parallel this world to that, every waking morning.A powerful book that will make you ask just a few more questions and become just a little more informed."
3,A biography of George Remus,"Overall, the book is a good source on Prohibition, but far from comprehensive. Contrary to the title, Behr spends a third of the book talking about the years leading up to Prohibition. The rest of the book goes into hair splitting detail on the career and trial of George Remus, known as the King of Bootleggers. I personally used the book as a source in writing my own book on Prohibition, but I only really used a couple of tidbits from it. If the Prohibition era were a song, Behr's book would be the countermelody, missing the general theme of the era. The book is good, but the title should be changed to ""George Remus and the History of the Prohibition Movement."" If you are interested in Prohibition check out:Alcohol, Boat Chases, and Shootouts! How the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs Fought Rum Smugglers and Pirates (Part I: 1919-1924)"
4,Unsung Sondheim,What a collection of unsung Sondheim tunes. At times I wondered why these songs had been dropped from shows. Well sung by the various artists.
3,"Good, but not as good as the audio version","The heart of the message is Tozer's, but it has been edited, condensed, rearranged, reworded, and reduced in quality by overzealous and undereducated editors. The result is a weaker version of Tozer's original messages. Fortunately, these are still available on audio cassette for those who would prefer the full strength of what Tozer meant to convey."
4,Not The Twilight Zone!,"This is the book to have if you are a fan of sf on tv. Although the series had its usual assortment of bug-eyed aliens set on conquering the Earth, The Outer Limits did try to add a few well written episodes, including ""Demon With a Glass Hand"" (a Hugo winner), and the episode ""Soldier"", both written by Harlan Ellison. Notable in this book is the inclusion of a shooting script for the ""Soldier"" episode. The book contains the usual insider information on production of the series, and contains some very interesting photos. A good reference for scifi fans!"
4,can't play on all devices,"Great compilation. The boys are so young and adorable in these vids! Love ALL things UB40. This disc will not play on PS2 or in DVD player, must use laptop."
1,The simple truth miscalled simplicity by this foolish author,"A hotchpotch of hooey from start to finish. The author should be ashamed of himself. In the words of the bard: 'needy nothing trimmed in jolity'.Tired with all this, from this will I be gone..."
2,A let down for this series,"I bought this album because Winter Party Volume 2 is one of my favorites. Unfortunately, Volume 4 did not deliver on the precedent set by Julian Marsh and Tony Moran in Volume 2. Where Volume 2 offered a incredible variety of masterfully remixed sounds (everything from Madonna, to Nanci Griffith, to spanish guitar, to Delibes) Volume 4 churned out a bunch of monotonous remixes of unknown, mediocre artists. While there were a few tracks I really enjoyed (Sunshine Day, Expand, and Daylight), I felt they were lost in their mundane surroundings. The rest of the tracks sounded the same, with similar styles and vocalists I couldn't differentiate from one another. It makes good background music, but doesn't have the same energy and composition as its predecessors."
2,Let's hope the party was better than the CD!!!!,"Sorry, but the previous rate should have listened to this CD first! I just didn't like it. Too much repeat boom-boom-boom. I felt like I was in a rainstorm and all I could hear was my windshield wipers! UGH! Winter Party #3 is MUCH better if you have to stick with WP. The Global Grooves series (One, Millenium, The New Groove), Michael Duretto (Evolution One, Two), White Party (Anniversary, X, '99, 2000) sets have much more ""value (dance) for the money. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,I was disappointed....,"Being a big fan of Jeff Daniels' acting and Revolutionary War drama, I ordered this movie and was very disappointed. The sequence of events is historically accurate but the characters are not very well portrayed. The crudity and obscenity were unbelievable in an unrated movie--in at least two places Washington uses the a-word to refer to someone's behind. Right! In the 1770s they still used that word to refer to a donkey. And we still have a copy of Washington's orders that his troops were to refrain from profanity. It is known under extreme provocation Washington used an occasional four-letter word, but never in casual conversation like in this movie. Stick with true history...try Jeff Shaara's books on the War."
1,Did not receive the product-The Crossing,"I did not receive the product I purchased and I'm pretty upset with the delivery process. I have USPS looking into it. Please expedite the delivery or send it again. This time, let it not be a whole month for me."
2,Not a good movie,"The Crossing is really just not a good movie, but I still find it interesting because some of the movie was filmed quite close to where I live; the opening scene when Washington's bedraggled army is marching through a wooded area, and the camp scenes near the beginning of the movie.To say that the acting in this movie was good would be a slight over-statement, and the dialogue is not what one would call stellar. I would not be so certain about the accuracy of the movie either--few movies are. The general course of events may be faithfully adhered to, but no movie based on a historical event that I can think of has not taken liberty with the truth for one reason or another."
3,crossed over the line,"This movie was well made, but had too much swearing in it. I understand that they were soldiers, but George Washington was a Christian and would not have spoken with so many profane words. We were only interested in the historical content of the film, but would only watch it once."
1,Poorly researched; poorly cast,"I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: ""how many killed?"" ""None"" (correct). ""How many wounded?"" ""none"". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States. Worth mentioning I would think."
2,Muddled,"I really wanted this to be as good as the other reviewers said it was, but I was really disappointed. I didn't get any insights into Washington's character, what gave him strength. The movie completely ignores Washington's faith in God. There was some unnecessary vulgarity as well. I bought this to help teach my kids about their country's roots, but this movie was no real help at all and a waste of money."
4,George Washington,"Fairly well done, except for the rather rough language that the real Mr. Washington would never have used.For a more realistic look at of our first president ,I recommend the movie John Adams.Mr. Washington was a true gentleman."
5,"If this were a book, you couldn't put it down.","I saw this movie twice on TV and it held my attention from start to finish. Well written, well acted, all around well done. I do have one problem with it, however. I am hard of hearing and use closed captioning. On TV this movie was close captioned. Unfortunately it is not CC on VHS or on DVD.You will love this movie if you have good hearing. I am ashamed of A&E; for putting out a product without closed captioning. Many of their home versions have the same problem. Shape up A&E;."
4,A good solid effort,"GW is a very hard man for Americans to warm up to the. The Man is like another Virginian that comes to mind, Robert E. Lee. Both seem to be Marble Men (Not of real flesh & blood). All I can say is Thank God we have men like them when we needed them.Mr Daniels does his best to create the persona of out Founding Father and I feel that he comes pretty close to the mark.This films captures what I feel is the key moment of Washington's life as a General. In a bold and courageous move he won a good solid victory that helped keep the cause alive. No one else could of done it. I also feel that it showed accurately for a movie at least what ot must of been like to have been there.The uniforms seemed correct as was the weopons and tactics.All around a good addition to ones collection."
4,Be Careful Crossing,"I purchased this film to use in my classroom while discussing one of the most pivotal moments in the American Revolution. Upon previewing the film though I was very disappointed in the amount of, what I felt, was unnecessary cursing. The words, I am guessing, were placed there to help the viewer understand the desperation of the situation, but unfortunately, this made the movie unviewable for my classroom.With regards to the movie's overall impression; Jeff Daniels does an admirable job as George Washington and projects a very convincing presence. You are witness to a man who has been beaten and defeated in every battle and skirmish for the last 18 months, and Daniels denotes this very well in his body language and demeanor. Many of the men who would become his original cabinet are also seen (Hamilton, Knox) by his side in this story. Would have been a great history lesson had it not been for the language."
5,Outstanding film,"The music made this terriffic film perfect- it was just excellent. The dvd also contains a behind the scenes special feature -which was good but not great. Jeff Daniels is great as George Washington, and has an excellent supporting cast. I thought the acting and emotion were terrific in portraying what Washington went through.. his army was being crushed and they needed to cross the Delaware and regroup to save the revolution. Good filming- an excellent production.. This is one of my favorite films."
4,Beautiful portrayal of Washington,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed this film and felt as though we'd really seen George Washington. The film begins in 1776 and ends with the conclusion of the surprise attack on Trenton. This is one chapter of history we feel intimately acquainted with now. Although it doesn't seem to have enjoyed a great budget and although it has just a hint of an educational taste to it, the Crossing seems far more historically relevant than films like Patriot or Pacino's Revolution. Daniels displays incredible posture especially while riding a horse and as a passenger in a boat through all hours of the night and thus quietly impresses upon us the dignity of America's first and fearless leader."
5,A SUPERB TELEVISION EPIC!,"""The Crossing"" is one of the finest TV movies ever made. The movie is superbly cast, and led by Jeff Daniels, who surprised me with his outstanding portrayal of George Washington. Why he wasn't asked to reprise the role in ""Benedict Arnold,"" I'll never know! The crossing of the Delaware River and the Battle of Trenton are created with accuracy and excitement. This is a must-own movie for anyone who enjoys serious films! Grade: A+"
5,The Crossing,My father and I have been looking for this movie on DVD for a while. Amazon was the best option out there. They offered the lowest priceses and it was easy to order. The movie was great and we enjoy watching it on weekends as a family. Thank you so much Amazon!! I plan to order more DVDs from your site!
5,The Crossing,My husband has wanted this movie for quite some time and was really thrilled to receive it for Christmas.
3,Wanted more......,"I was anxious to get this book, so much so that I bought it off of amazon.uk to get it sooner. The book goes into extreme detail at the beginning of Duran. A lot of it has been written about. The stuff I really wanted to know about was from 1990 and up, which I felt was glossed over. I agree with the first reviewer,Dorrie, that important things were mentioned in 2 sentences. It was interesting to hear about the separation of Warren from Duran. The media made it sound amicable, which according to the book was not. There were other things that weren't mentioned such as John Taylor's stint in rehab. Malin's goes into great detail about drug use and then causually mentions that Taylor went into rehab along the way. I was a bit disappointed with the book. I really wanted more info. There has not been a lot written about them since the 80's and I was looking forward to catching up. I am still wanting to know more."
3,Typical...,"This bio is typical of Malins' work. The Depeche Mode book he wrote a few years ago followed much the same formula : Many early ( read : unknown and/or long forgotten ) associates and collaborators are quoted, each members' background is thoroughly examined and the road to glory is meticulously detailed. The first five years of Duran Duran takes up about half the book. Then the closer we get to the present, the faster the facts fly by, and the slimmer the details become. Approximately twenty years is covered in the last half of the book. Events are glossed over, many which are definately worth more than the little mention they get. And most all the quotes from band members are taken from other, previously published sources. Don't get me wrong. I've been a big fan of this band since 1982 and I enjoyed this book. But, as others have noted, it very simply left me wanting more. I suppose an authorized bio will clear all that up. In the meantime, Notorious very nearly satisfies."
2,Not for seasoned fans...,"This book is nothing more than a hodge-podge of hastily gathered interviews and reviews from the thousands of articles already written about Duran Duran. Steve Malin's account of the band from its early years to the present day is adequate at best, but there is hardly anything in the book that the seasoned Duran fan does not already know. Malin claims to have interviewed over 50 people close to the band for this book, but there seems to be precious little of any personal accounts in the finished product. If you know nothing about Duran Duran, and are curious, this book is a good start. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,A chore,As a 20 year Duran fan I was anxious to read this. It does have some interesting tidbits but I found Mr. Malins writting style rather a chore to read. The detailed recap of reviews for every song of every album seems like just page filler. Only the true die-hard Duran Duran fan will have the resolve to read this book start to finish.
4,Strapped,This was Bokeem Woodbine's debut. It was a good depiction of the gun trafficking that goes on in the inner cities of America especially in NYC. This would be a good learning tool for many of today's teenager's on how reckless life can be if they are not careful.
5,AHHHHH the good old 90's,"If you haven't been to the streets of an urban town where drugs and guns are on the boost of popularity, then this is the film for you. After seeing Strapped you'll know exactly what happens in places all over the world where teenagers become school drop-outs and gun buyers. If you watch this movie the first time you might fall asleep but watch it again and understand it more then you'll love it."
3,Good but way too short,"I wish to make it known to people that the actual documentary itself only lasts 25 minutes.It is very well photograped and has an appealing sound track, I purchased my copy for 5 dollars with free postage. So the price matched the content.However I would not recommend paying more than 8 dollars for it including postage.Of course that is my opinion a surfing fanatic may differ, but beware it is 25 minutes long plus some extras."
4,strapped is the movie !,this is a movie that make new york look good an the acter play a good roll an end good check it out to see what it about !
4,A Sleeper Hit!!,"Forest Whtaker's directorial debut, Strapped is a gritty action packed drama of a young black man conflicted in his feeling of being loyal to his own or representin' his Housing Projects code of Silence when it comes to crime. Newcomer Bokeem Woodbine does a good job in his acting debut as DiQuan Mitchell, The Teen with the conflicted feelings. Rap Star Fredro Starr is excellent as the Gun Selling,Take no shorts Character,Bamboo.Excellent Movie with a surprising Climax!! A Must See!! Michael Biehn is also surprisingly good as Police Officer McCrane. Kia Goodwin,Jermaine Hopkins,Willie Stiggers Jr. and Rappers Kool Moe Dee, Monie Love,Busta Rhymes,Das EFX & YoYo also star in this flick. Kudos also to the Actor who played ""Ben"",the supposedly family Man who uses his FFL license to purchase guns by mail, then in turn sells them to the Kids of the Brooklyn Housing Projects... A Must see for fans of Urban filmed & shot Drama!!STARS!!"
4,Strapped,The acting was good considering it was Fredro Starr and Bokine Woodbines first movie on the big screen. The movie addressed some of the issues that are affecting our young inner city youth. The sales provider provided quality service and product.
1,"""GOOD BAND, BUT ANNOYING SINGER""","I LIKE THE BAND ON THIS CD, BUT THE GIRL SINGER'S VOICE IS VERY ANNOYING. I FOUND IT HARD TO LISTEN TO HER."
4,Pico's Narrative More Accurate than History Books,"I read this book with personal interest. My ancestor, Pio Pico, was a hard working, pioneering man who helped in the early development of Los Angeles and Southern California. I recommend additional reading on the miscarriage of justice he experienced in our court system after he was the last Mexican Governor of California. History books are full of misconceptions and errors regarding Pio Pico and do not reflect the real man behind the story the way this book does."
3,Billy Barty remembered,"When we got this book, we thought it was a biography, and since we are related to him, we wanted to hear more about his family. It was a collection of remembrances of Billy Barty by famous people who knew him. It was different than we expected, but still interesting."
5,How one man has touched so many...,"Being so fortunate to have been touched by Billy Barty's legacy through my brother Erik's life, reading ""Within Reach"" helped me see just how many other lives one man was able to touch. ""Within Reach"" presents a positive theme through its contributions and examples of how Billy Barty impacted his colleagues, friends, family and fans."
5,"it's just what I expected to be, the perfect tool for beginers.","this is the perfect tool for those who want to learn hebrew, good for beginers and advanced students."
5,Wonderful Resource,Having the equivalent of an English phrase in Hebrew at your fingertips makes this book priceless!
4,English to Hebrew Only,"Good Dictionary, I failed to pay attention to the unidirectional. It is only English to Hebrew."
5,Highly Recommend! Wonderful Book,Jeff Smith is an awesome photographer. His books are full of useful in formation. I highly recommend it!!!!
5,Outdoor and Location photography,"Jeff does a great job in relaying the techniques and theories with outdoor location photography. I have always wondered how photographers captured those wonderful pictures of models and ordinary people in outdoor settings. In this book, Jeff discusses the various tools and techniques involved as well as sharing pictures of the actual sites that he was shooting at. Being able to see his setups really helped me appreciate the final ptrs better. It allows me as an apsiring portrait photographer goals and methods to try and replicate and then build upon. I truely like Jeff's writing style and explanations in that he is easy to understand and follow. I have used his methods with my own clients and found it very helpful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a solid reference on photographing people outdoors."
3,"Barely okay for practice, but not much fun","Dance Mania relies heavily on a synthesizer. This cha cha disc is the best of the four discs I listened to. I am not a fan. I would not want to listen to it again. It does not make me want to dance.WinRon Productions provides a lot of music for Dance Vision International. These music cds are available with an instructional DVD. If you want the music, buy it in the DVD / CD package instead. Dance Vision's dance instruction is excellent, and it saddens me to see them cheapen their label by releasing these mediocre cds apart from the DVDs.Title, duration, downbeats per minute for each cha cha:Cool 'n' sweet, 3:32, 30 bpm6th element, 2:29, 30 bpmCasino, El, 2:40, 31 bpmMi cha cha, 2:33, 31 bpmHavana, 1:57, 31 bpmEspaña cha ,2:16, 31 bpmNobody like you, 2:19, 31 bpmMochatone, 2:42, 31 bpmTrue illusion, 2:49, 31 bpmCha cha latino, 2:56, 31 bpm"
5,A worthy addition to his solo work...,"I wish musicians and bands would do this more!!!! An EP that has no slack or filler. Sweet short and simple. Although, this music is by no means simple or sweet on face value, it is haunting and synthesized. This strikes the same vein as the Kid A - Amnesiac saga -- and could be viewed as a chilling addition, expect that it's not Radiohead here, but Thom Yorke! This man continues to amaze me with the effects and extensive use of synthesizers all by his lonesome. This album is a very impressive effort that stands proudly next to its predecessor, _The Eraser_. I think it foreshadows more good things to come from Thom Yorke's solo career."
4,thom yorke's spitting feathers b-sides,if you love radiohead/thom yorke there's no doubt that you'll enjoy this ep. harrowdown hill's extended remix is even lovelier than the original. the video is great too. definitely recommend!
4,VERY GOOD .NET WEB COVERAGE,"""Programming .NET Web Services"" is an easy-to-understand text, which simplified all the difficult aspects of XML Web Services (as it concerned Microsoft .NET platform).At 500 pages, this book is not that voluminous, yet, it detailed most of the essential issues needed in order to utilize all the .NET options which one is likely to encounter on both Microsoft and non-Microsoft clients.I really find this book useful, despite the fact that some of its elaborations are not as extensive as I would like them to be. This textbook is better used as a daily text, or as the case may be, a quick reference resource."
1,Out-of-date + No step-by-step guidance,"Ok first of all, this is my very first review. I've been buying and reading a lot of programming books and this one really disappoints me. I learn better when the author walks me through a complete working example step-by-step without assuming I know something. But there is no such thing here plus it is completely out of date and talks about building web services using different mediums, which I don't really care for. Just do one thing well, but this book tries to cover everything and in the process completely fails to educate its reader. Bottom line, don't waste your time and money here...."
2,Out of date,"The book is now 7+ years out of date. There's enough of a difference with Visual Studio 2008 to void some of the examples. I learned all I needed in the first 3 chapters, and still skipped a bunch. I didn't see a second edition offered, which would be useful."
2,One trick pony,"The best thing about this book is the cover art. The next best thing is actually being briefly taken in by the idea that you can self-inflict stigmata by reading the word 1000 times. Then laughing at yourself. Not a worthless book by any means, but a 10 minute read if you don't want to experiment."
2,What?,"This novel or as the author descibes it as an ""antinovel"" is just mind boggling. The book is filled up with repetition and certain specific research about the history of the stigmata. The stigmata is fascinating and I have always wanted to know the background and history involving it. This book really just gives the reader dates of famous stigmata recipients and then just repeats the word stigmata hundreds of times with little pieces of the authors opinions hidden in the text. This book is very much its classification as experamental..but maybe a little too much and not enough focus, interesting reading."
1,Wow ... Just BAD!,"Its obvious these guys are DONE. A once dominant force in the heavy metal genre reduced to a pile blubbering crybabies and forced into reality TV. This is just recycled stuff with a different cover. It starts out with mediocre potential and then put me to sleep with tired riffs boring until the end. No imagination. Lets hope this is last from these clowns. I'm glad I picked this up for .99 at a used CD mart. Unfortunately, I paid .90 too much."
3,Not what you'd expect,"If you have been a hardcore Metallica fan since you can remember, this album is probably going to be a major let-down. Metallica has always had that certain Metallica flavor to their music, but this one has changed, and not necessarily for the better. Most of the fans of this album will be those rebel teens and college students, including mainstream fans. As far as how it sounds, it is not unlistenable. I don't have a problem with listening to the songs, they are entertaining enough, but the lack of solos is a major poo-poo for the album. If you are a nu-metal fan, you'll probably go for this album. If you're a die-hard Metallica fan, just keep the albums you have, and don't suffer the pain in the side that this album will give you."
1,What a waste of time,"I am sorry, but I have to inform all of you that this CD is a waste of time! I am a big fan of Metallica, but St. Anger is terrible. There is one or two ""ok"" songs, but the rest of them are riddled with annoying tin can sounding drums, and very little guitar solos. Not to mention the lame lyrics, tic tic tic tic -- come on.Buy the latest Nickelback instead!Wishing the next CD is way way way better."
1,"I waited return to old years, but this is f*****g bad!","This album better shouldn't came out!I awaited from Metallica they will return musically to great 80's years like many others metal band ( see Iron Maiden's Brave new world and Dance of death )after Load/Reload falling down, but ... St.Anger is worst.A band maybe should rename his name from Metallica to Poprockollica :-) , because this is disaster and far away from some good metal bands.Awful,no other words.Lars,James,Kirk - better stop it all and go relax."
1,Metallica 's Rigor Mortis,"First, I think one star is too much for this CD , maybe 1\4 of a star would be enough. this is not the worst of Metallica, it is one of the worst ever music recorded for decades.This CD is not rock neither rap, I think a new category of music crap would be the word describing it.No solos, no harmony, no singing, bad drums, idiot words, even sound eng. was so much bad.Metallica is in great danger of loosing their old fans , if any body of these aging rockers still has the sense of music, they should withdrow it from all shops, and release something to erase this bad memory.Shame on you Metallicas."
2,What the hell is this?,"As a Metallica fan since the late 80's, I was eagerly anticipating this album. I can't believe it, but I did not like one song the first time I heard St.Anger. Why does the production sound so cheap? Lars sounds like he's playing a kiddie drum set and his drums mute the sound of the guitars which don't sound that great either. These guys should have worked with the producer that produced System Of A Down's Toxicity for a better sound. That is what an album should sound like. Crunching guitars and heavy drums that don't block out the guitars. Hetfield can't sing anymore. There are some good riffs on the record, but no solos? Also what happened to songs in the style of Unforgiven. I guess they just wanted to prove that they could play harder than anyone. They just forgot that its not only how fast or hard you play. You have to write good SONGS and Hetfield can't write those anymore. This record sounds like it was made in the 80's."
1,Saint Aweful,"The only thing i can say is that I just wasted [$$$], Jason Newstead took all the talent with him when he left the band !!The worst garbage i have ever heard. Id sooner listen to N Sync than listen to this CD again!!"
5,Gotta love it for the anger,"I'm not a musical expert, I can only say that I like this album a lot. Metallica changed their style, and many people don't like their ""new"" sound, but I, personally, love the raw ""anger-metal"" that you listen on this one.Heavy metal rules.Thanks.Goodnight"
2,a big let down,"i have been a metallica since ""ride the lightning"", so i feel that i can judge fairly here. i think the songs are a little too long and boring. there are too many tempo changes (just when it's in a rockin' groove) they slow it down. where is kirk hammett's solos?? they have lost their edge here. i realize that ""and justice for all"" had some long song's on there....but at least they were well structured song's. i believe the boy's need to start drinking again to get back that real fire and aggression. i give 1 star for the cd & 1 star for the bonus dvd. oh well, i can alway's pop ""ride the lightning"" or ""master of puppet's"" in the cd player and reminisce on how it used to be."
2,Old Metallica minus a snare drum,"I popped this baby into the car stereo and cranked it. Speed Metallica just like the old days! First song pretty good, OK, I think we've got a winner here. Then all of a sudden I hear this ringing, pinging dinging sound. What is that? It's like Lars forgot to turn on the snare on his snare drum. Pretty annoying but I can make it through one track . But now it's in my head and it's really bothering me and I can't ignore it. And what the [heck] it's the same on the next track and the next one. I keep thinking this has got to be a joke. That snare is part of what keeps this band tight! The rest of the band is right on but the drum keeps ringing past the cut-offs.I am so bummed. Maybe Bob Rock got so into ghost playing his bass parts that he forgot to pay any attention to producing. How could this happen? Someone let me in on the joke! Stop that ringing!"
1,Hey guy a few below me,"The guy below me a few reviews gave this a 5 star rating, not only that but he said Joe Satiani and Yngwie Malmsteen suck. I hope Yngwie's tours bus hits you and you are eaten by wolves."
3,"Not their best, but somewhat worth a listen.","I am the first to admit i love Load. I don't enjoy Reload as much, but I don't hate it. When I sit down for music, I don't listen to it and examine every detail, I listen to music.St. Anger is not Metallica's shining moment, but comes in handy when you need something angry and frantic. I love the first three tracks, it kind of fades off from there, but I picked up a used copy for 4.99 and it was at least worth that."
3,give it a chance to grow on you.,"i first want to say i love metallica. when i bought this cd i was anxious to hear it and as i heard it i was quite disappointed. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. lars sounds like he's pounding on trash can lids or pipes. hearing james raw singing was not the voice that i'm use to. i didn't want to give up on them. i kept listening and listening until it grew on me. invisible kid, sweet amber, shoot me again and st. anger i can now say are my favorites. if you're a true fan then buy this cd. give in to the fact that music does change and metallica has been out for many many years and trying something new and raw is a taking a big risk. then again it's the all mighty metallica."
1,St. Anger - The thing that should not be,"This album ranks number three on my list of the worst albums by the greatest bands. Is this what has become of the greatest metal band of thier time? Kirk Hammet doesnt rip at all on this album, resorting to power chords. The lyrics are weak and repetitive and the vocal part does not present any sort of musical ability. The MetallicA that created ""Ride the Lighting"" and ""Master of Puppets"" is long gone and this album proves it. On the other hand, if you like Limp Bizkit and Slipknot and the rest of that death metal/rap garbage then you should enjoy these 11 tracks of trash. As for the rest of us, all we can do is hope MetallicA realizes what junk they are producing and goes back to the style that made them the biggest rock icon since Led Zeppelin... But don't count on it."
2,Mediocre,"I wanted to like this album really bad... Unfortunately, I've been disappointed once again (I was disappointed with load/re-load too).I think this album sounds like Metallica is trying too hard to sound heavy, again. Every song has a cheezy metal riff on it. They sound like some cheezy metal band, that's just starting out in their garage, that listens to too much Metallica.And if that wasn't bad enough, the recording sounds like it was done with one mic on a boom box! (Does anyone else hear that annoying bell in the snare drum?!?! And why are the vocals so frickin' loud?!?! My Grandma has more balls than this album!!!)Through the whole album, I feel like I'm sitting there waiting for the punch line.I still respect Metallica for what they were, but I can't respect them for what they are now....."
1,Threw It Out My Car Window,"This CD wasn't good enough to use as a drink coaster. It's apparant from the ""Some Kinda Monster"" DVD Metallica are just spoiled rich guys, not putting any real creative intensity into their work. Since they've collectively ""lost it"" as artists, perhaps they should go their separate ways...after all, this album is not Metallica. It's more like Lars puking on the mixing board. Kirk is nowhere with guitar lead (doesn't want to be bothered). I'm not sure whether to feel sympathy for James or not...perhaps he shouldn't have been trying to do an album while he was in rehab. Either way, this is the worst recording and the farthest fall from grace of any band in history. I hope they won't record again, which is ashame since I was such a fan back in the day."
3,"YES IT IS HEAVY, BUT NOT MUCH MORE","WELL, I HAVE HEARD THE DISK, AND YES IT IS HEAVY, YES IT HAS IT'S FAST MOMENTS THAT BEING SAID, A FEW THINGS COME TO MIND. THE DRUMS LACK BODY, THE BASS SEEMS TO BE DOING EXACTLY WHAT THE GUITARS ARE DOING, AND PRODUCTION SEEMS TO BE LACKING.BUT ON THE GOOD SIDE, IT IS DEFINATLY MORE LIKE ""METALLICA"" EVEN IF IT'S NOT ""KICK-ASSMETALLICA"".I DO ENJOY THE ALBUM, AND IT DOES MAKE ME WANNA HEAD BANG, JUST NOT AS MUCH AS MASTER OF PUPPETS."
3,"It Could've Been Worse, Really...","What can I say about this album? Well, it's not exactly like ""Ride the Lightning"" although I must admit it's mostly speed metal. Like always, Lars's drumming is shoddy (wonder if he should turn to calypso). Metallica has NEVER been a bass-heavy band, at least since Tim Burton's untimely death. Most importantly there is no song that will, in my opinion, become a classic, like ""One"", ""Sad But True"", etc., etc., etc. In spite of all of this it's still an album I don't mind listening to. It could've been worse."
1,Holy crap Batman!,"Wow. don't even bother reading these reviews, just listen to the sample provided for ""Invisible kid"". I know Mettalica as never been known for brilliant lyrics (Enter Sandman anyone?), but, wow. How many words rhyme with kid? About 30. So, lets use all of them in the first 30 seconds of the song. Without irony. wow. I guess it shouldn't be much of a shock considering this band stopped making good albums almost immediately after they started, but jeez."
2,i made a review already but this should be sed,i heard the song st anger on aol music it was a 'live' version of the song.even though its played with rob trujilo and lars has a better drum set.and james makes no vocal mistakes.and theres no audience.the reason st anger sounds bad is because.1.lars has a crappy drum set2.james messes up on his vocals3.bob rock plays bass4.bad preductionin this showing of it all those things are changed.it sounds better because1.lars has a good drum set2.james does a better job on vocals3.rob trujilo plays bass4.fair production
3,Mix of Emotions,"I will always love Metallica's music. I have listened to them since grade school (and I'm not hesitating.) They are not dumb-they know that Load and Re-load were pieces of S^%t and they had to drastically change, and fast. Honestly, my biggest complaint is the sound quality. I know that sound stupid, especially since half the music I listen to is poor sound quality, but I'm used to Metallica sounding clean and put together. I miss the MAster of Puppets days so much, when they just desroyed all music around them. The next album will be like that if they are as smart as I think they are. I want ripping solos, and thrash, like the old days. I want some Black Album moments too in the future. All in all they got back on the path to greatness. I guess that this is the prequel to Kill em'All, and Ride the Lightning is next..."
1,Why????,"Metallica USED to be my most favorite band. All their albums were so tight & heavy. But ever since they cut their hair they suck now, I mean their last awesome album was their black untitled album. After that it's like they turned light rock. I mean they did have just only a couple good songs after the black album like Ain't My Bitch, 2x4, House That Jack Built, but that's it, all their stuff since the black album seems so light rock now, I can't stand it, it's nauseating. I wish they were as heavy as they used to be, but oh well. I'm off to better bands now that are actually heavy (...)"
1,1 is enough,"now i know why they give bonus dvd, this album is more like a jamming session. nothing cool. no solos, trash can drumworst album ever made, the lyrics and lyrics are repeative , this album sounds heavy to me cause it suck so bad and made me cant stand it"
1,"Metallica tries ""back to roots"" but falls out of the tree!","What the he** happened? All this waiting for this garbage? I am one of those long time fans who loved ""Load"" & ""Reload"". Two albums of tasty tracks that all showed individuality. Then there was the Metallica (black)Album! A masterpeice! This is an album of a bunch of garbled vocal, speed noise! I have always stuck by Metallica through thick and thin. Sorry guys, I rather hear ""Low Man's Lyric"" eleven times than listen to this misguided stuff! I am so disappointed! Have fun on tour, I won't be there!"
1,st. corporate,"bands don't attack their fans for downloading their music, therapy sessions, coporate icons, same songs."
3,Go easy,"C'mon guys why is everyone giving this cd a one?Very ballsy of you guys seeing as probably all of you couldnt play half as good as these guys.Anyways i have to say that this cd isnt a masterpiece either.I can look past the fact that they omitted any guitar solos.And i can look past the fact that u cant hear the bass at all.But i dont think anyone can disagree that this cd is very fast.Lars is a great drummer(even though he killed napster.lol) and James is a metal icon on his own.The standout on this one is definatly the single ""St. Anger"" and also ""All Within My Hands"" is a good song also.However everything else sounds kinda bland and rushed together, but still its all very fast and catchy.I think everyone should stop hoping for another Master Of Puppets because its not gonna come. Try to open your mind and embrace where metallica is going.If not then buy something else and stop trash talking these guys because they have payed there dues and deserve respect for what they have accomplished."
1,Is this an anti-piracy tactic?,"'Cause what a brighter idea than to release an album that no-one would bother downloading, let alone BUYING!! I won't go into further details, Metallica was done, well over a decade ago and this embarassment has only put the last nail on their glorified coffin."
1,"What is up with those drums, Lars??????","I will make this short: This album is God-awful. Every song has this crappy hollow-echoing drumming by Lars that overpowers even the guitars. It sounds like a child's drum set being played by a spastic. If you haven't heard this album yet, don't bother. I listened to it twice, and those stupid drums just made me insane. What were they thinking?I hope they can make a comeback with something else. The album should be titled ""St. Piece of Sh-t."""
1,Stop the Good reviews,"Reading the reivews of sait anger, i have found out alot of people say they just like the album because they suport metallica, or they feel we need to give them a chance to like the new music. but i feel they are all rong. We need to show metallica that we (the public/fans)do not like the new music, so they will change the music style on the next album to a style that more people will enjoy. for all those people out there supoting metallica's new album just to suport metallica should stop, telling them you like it will just make them play more of this sh*ty ass music, i just want to let them no they made a bad choice, and will hopefully they will learn from it... now who's with me?P.S still a metallica fan, and will die happy just the same."
1,BWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA...,... HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ... ha ... ah ... uuunnghhh ... *erp* (wretches on cd player)
1,this is metallica?,"What? Hello!!!! This album doesn't even sound like the Metallica as we knew it!!! If you read the lyrics, they aren't that bad, but the way they perfomed it, the way they made it sound, its terrible, just terrible. I really liked metallica, the old metallica. People may say they like this album, but you've got to wake up and smell the coffee (the rotten old coffee i might add) and realize how this album has just brought Metallica down. Don't buy this CD, I thought it was going to be great, and after i bought it, i was totally dissapointed. Its a waste of money and there are better CD's out there to buy."
5,Best change in direction i've seen....,"this seems the start of a new Metallica, with an almost complete abandon of the old Metallica, which has many a fan pissed. I understand, the old Metallica were great too, but if you can unhook yourself from that old Metallica, maybe pretend this is an album from a new unknown band if you must, you will find a very good and complex album.The sound needs to grow some more, but i love this direction and the energy coming from it.Good job!!!"
1,They quit,"Let me tell you this:it's obvious that some people will like this album and others will not.Everything in the world goes like that.You can see here in Amazon who liked this one:it's people who make lists recommending Linkin'Park,Coldplay,Bruce Springsteen and so on.You can see here who didn't like it:it's people who make lists recommending In Flames,Opeth,early Metallica,Devin Townsend and so on.I join this group,proudly,of real metal fans.This is not true metal,the recording is badly done,lyrics are not interesting and it's boring.Metallica is worse than ever.I hope Iron Maiden's ""Dance of Death"",to be released in September,doesn't disappoint me as Metallica did since ""And Justice...""."
1,SOME KIND OF MONSTROSITY,"Please kill me now.If you want your music collection to sound like this all you need is a cat, a red-hot pole and an empty biscuit tin. Metallica have fallen from great heights and are gaining velocity. I thought they'd hit rock bottom with Load and ReLoad but they're still digging. Someone said they were going back to their roots but they must have taken a wrong turn, for they missed the mark completely. The guitars sound pretty bad - where are Hammet's solos? Hetfield sounds awful; the lyrics make me cringe. Don't get me started on Ulrich's snare. And the new guy hasn't impressed me much either. This is an abomination, an insult to metal.Buy this if you want to kill yourself but don't have the guts. It will give you that extra nudge."
1,god this is offensively shit,"metallica arent really my fave band but i got into them after hearing one from justice, i borrowed this album form my local library and i couldnt beleive just how awful, crap, sh*t, w*ank, poor this album is. god its bollocks, notjing vut everyone attacking the strings. dont waste your time, money and sanity with this crap. ITS PISS POOR."
1,THEY ARE BACK!!!! AND THEY SUCK!!!!!,"Im sure metallica still rocks live but this album just flat out sucks hardcore. People wanted this to be so good they listen to it in denial, pretending and telling themselves that it is awesome, but lets be honest....if a another band name was on this CD other then metallica everyone would hate it!!!! You know it is the truth!! I like the heavy sound they are doing and I have no problem with the sound quality but lets face it, these songs just plain SUCK!!!! I dont know how anyone can say these songs are catchy, and some of these lyrics are horrible! I do think the next album will problably be good but this one isnt."
1,The last of Metallica,"Sorry to say but Metllica is no longer what it was none for, this sounds like a bunch of teenagers in there garage trying to make a grunge cd. There metal not grunge. No more guitar solos horrible lyrics, and the drummer is decent just thats all you hear is Lars thrashing on his drums. The people that say they like this is lying, there just trying to ignore the fact that Metallica sucks. A band like Godsmack who does sound a lot like Metallica sounds better then this cd, and most rip offs of Metallica sound horrible but Godsmack in my option sounds better then Metallica (present day) IF any one was a mettlica fan please do not buy this and support Metllica in the ""Master of Puppets"", and ""Ride the Lightning"" era do not get this but do support Metallica, and get here older stuff this is not what they are fully capable of."
1,The End Of Metallica,"I bought this album not long ago and I have to say that this is the worst Metallica album yet. The lyrics are meaningless and every song goes off beat and jacked. Metallica died in 91 but they are definitley selling out. I listened to it over and over and watched the dvd countless times and tried to enjoy it, but I just can't. Do not waste your money on this album it sucks. I am a loyal old skool Met fan, but this is ridiculous. Don't buy it. Go listen to real music like CKY, Malevolent Creation, Old Metallica and Black Sabbath."
4,Therapy Session Lyrics,"This is the album Metallica was working on when they were filming Metallica: Some Kind of Monster(DVD). If you keep that in mind the songs are really kind of interesting. Especially ""The Unnamed Feeling"".Metallica - Some Kind of Monster"
3,i thought the songs sounded the same and the vocals too,"When I first listened to this cd i didn't like it much. I thought the vocals were poor and sounded the same during each song, I thought the music sounded the same during each song, and I didnt think the drums were good at all. I also thought the songs seemed too long without solos, and i love solos. Best part of most songs. But after awhile i got used to the drums and after listened to the songs more closely, I realized that it wasnt such a bad cd after all. It's still my least favorite Metallica cd, but it has a different taste to it, which isn't necasarily a bad thing considering they've been around for 24 years and still going. Overall, I only recommend you buy this cd if you'd give metallica, as a band, a 4 star rating or higher. Otherwise you probably will not enjoy it."
4,"Bad casing, awesome CD!","I hate digipak casing. First of all because the CDS get scratched up easily. I got the St. Anger like that and 24 hours later the CD is all scratched up because of the case. Anyway, onto the CD. IT ROCKS! IT IS SO GOOD! I LOVE IT!!!!!"
3,Metallica Has Returned...WITH NO DISSAPOINTMENT!,"Metallica are through with there bad...last 3 albums. St. Anger is fast, hard hitting, and the old metallica we loved. If you think they didnt recover, listen for yourself.Full with colorful in your face riffs, crunchy bass, and smacking aggretional drums...lets just say it is totally unexpected of what I though they were after Black album. Yes, there back and its not like ""after Black"". Its worth your buy, you will not be dissapointed."
1,just another nu-rock album,"i dunno if i gotta cry or laugh at metallica for releasing this album, hetfield voice is not the same and the songs are really messed-up i'rather st.anger to be an instrumental album, there is something wrong about 'tallica. im really dissapointed. try to listen to it before buy!!!"
1,"Metallica is a bunch of overpaid, untalented, business men.","I think when Metallica decided to make this record and have the movie come out documenting the recording process, it was clearly a business move. Because Metallica, knows it has loyal diehard fans, and they could release anything and people would buy it. This record was a desperate attempt to make a profit at any cost. Don't let them steal your money for this piece of garbage. There's no more integrity in their music. It shows you the kind of people Metallica really are. A bunch of overpaid, untalented, business men."
1,Unbelievably HORRIBLE,"This is the most pitiful thing I've ever heard. Up until the ""Black"" album, Metallica were amazing, and even little bits of ""Load"" were okay, but, WOW.... Put it this way, if you put third graders with potty mouths into a room with guitars, told them to write about what makes them angry, add in some ""cool"" swear words here and there, and then put a retarded, deaf kid in the producers chair, you'd make a better ""metal"" album than this. When did Lars start playing on tin cans? It's 3 years now since I first had to turn this album off (midway through ""Invisible Kid"" I had to break it in half and go vomit), and I'm still pissed. F--- YOU, METALLICA!!!! Way to turn your fans against you even more, idiots!!"
1,Time for a greatest hits album,"The main reason that Metallica survived from the 80s into the 90s was because of a remarkable ability to come up with a seemingly endless stream of heavy melodies. Those melodies were used for riffs and vocal lines, giving a wonderful sound to ultra-distorted guitars and Hetfield's gruff voice.Well, folks, that ability seems to have gone the way of Jason Newsted. Instead, we have a cacophonous piece of garbage with nary a vocal note to be had. Hetfield, ever of limited range now reverts to simply screaming, Hammett seems to have died, and Ulrich plays on a drum set stolen from a Times Square bum.I was never one to say that Metallica sold out with Load, and I'm not saying they sold out now. They simply have reached their limit as songwriters. I would be very surprised if they were able to come back from this debacle with another decent album."
1,you can only wonder what crap is next,"yes this metallica cd dose indeed suck... Bo Rock messed with the snare tuning, James can't scream any more, there are basicly no solos, and rob is just an ass. take my advice DON""T GET IT!!! if u want a good tallica cd get kill em all, ride the lighting, master of puppets or and justice for all"
1,St. Piece of Junk!,"Yes, I'm angry. Angry by being fooled by this once beloved band. Angry with Lars. Angry with this lack of production being advertised as a ""comeback to the old sound"". THeir ""Old sound"" was Master of Puppets, Kill 'Em All. And thei had PRODUCTION and they DID NOT HAVE Bob Rock.That's it."
1,WELLCOME TO NU-METAL GARBAGE CLUB.,"We are Metallica, we forgot our past when we are a THRASH band.Now we are in the same team of bands like korn, limp bizkit and linkin park. Nu-Metal sells and we wanna make cash! So buy this piece of junk and make us even more rich!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"What can I say about this album which hasnt already been said? It's flat out terrible! They did not go back to their ""roots"". Anyone who rates this album higher than a 1 or 2 must work for Metallica's record company and is trying to get the rating a little higher. Trust me, I used to LOVE Metallica. Even Load and Re-Load are better than this stinker."
1,Worst album I've ever heard,"I can't even get past the 3rd song before I have to stop and put something else in. This CD gives me a headache. Give a kid some pots and pans and let him bang on them and see how long you can go before you get a headache as well.I would try to trade this disc in at the used CD shop, but they won't even take it since they already got a boatload of used copies that other people already traded in.I'm ashamed to even have bought this CD. If I would've known what I know now, you couldn't pay me to download this crap online."
1,NOT VERY GOOD - ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY BAD,"I used to love Metallica. I still listen to the older stuff and I have even come to embrace the first 6 tracks off of Load. It's been over a year now and St Anger still flatlines my enthusiasm when listening to it. It really is a poorly made CD. From the horrendous sound and production to the poorly crafted songs, and finally the silly 4th grader lyrics. There is nothing here I can endorse. I see Lars and James promoting their movie that is coming out this month and I feel they have become wealthy detached people. I have no interest in paying 10 bucks to see Lars and James bicker like little kids. Who wants to watch over two hous of that ? They truely have become clueless..."
5,"Raw, Harsh & Heavy.","If you want a raw, harsh, heavy album from a legendary band then this album is for you. For those who are scared by heavy music, then might I suggest any of the multitude of similar sounding pop albums available from the non-talented. To truely appreciate the greatness poured into this album, it needs to be listened to more than once."
1,Not even worthy of the 99 cent bin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What the h*ll were Metallica thinking? ST.Anger is absolutely the worst album I have ever heard. Number one it sounds so different than any other Metallica album that came before it. It also has the worst lyrics I have ever heard. Bands like Winger and Quiet Riot come up with better lyrics than these. One of the biggest problems with St Anger is that they stretch out the songs to long. Many of the songs could have ok if they were around 3-4 minutes, but at the 8-10 minute mark most of the songs are extremely annoying. I wish I could return this album! I'm thinking about running it over with my car, I think that would be the most joy I could get from this album."
1,Nu-Metallica,"If I could give this album a zero I would... Metallica started out as playing REAL Heavy Metal Load and Re-Load were OKAY by my standards not bad not good..... but this new album is just trash they have gone from bad to worse... Nu-Metallica is total commercial TRASH and has not one shred of good in it! Total utter TRASH... So do yourself a favor dont buy this CD EVER.... if you want REAL Heavy Metal look into the following bandsHeavy Metal- Helloween, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Sonata Arctica, Panteraand if you like extreme stuff look intoDimmu Borgir, Emperor, Darkthrone, Mayhem, Dodheimsgard, Immortal etc....LONG LIVE THE TRUE METAL SCENE!!!!DOWN WITH COMMERCIAL TRASH!"
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"If you are a Metallica fan, then stay away from this CD. I have listened to it several times in an attempt to find something enjoyable about it, and it is just a waste of time and money. Hetfield's vocals are terrible, to much emphasis on Ulrich's drums, no Hammet solos, and the bass playing of a producer and not a musician. Forget the other reviews praising Trujillo's arrival into the band. His involvment with this CD was that he joined the band in time to have his picture taken for the insert. Bass was actually handled by producer Bob Rock. To sum this CD up, it blows. Cliff Burton must have been psychic because he actually took the easy way out!"
1,Weak!,DIE HARD FAN OF THE BOYS HERE BUT I LISTENED TO THE ALBUM TWICE ALREADY AND IT SOUNDS SO WEAK! I HAVE TO RATE THIS RIGHT DOWN WITH THE LOAD AND RELOAD ALBUMS - SORRY ITS JUST NOT THERE... MAYBE ITS TIME FOR THEM TO EITHER STICK WITH WHAT WORKED ALL THESE YEARS OR HANG 'EM UP! -- ...AND METALLICA FOR ALL! PEACE!
1,Are they getting worse?,"I've been a die hard Metallica fan for years. Lately their stuff has been getting worse. At least the ""load"" albums were still a little hard and listenable. The ...And Justice For All album is their best. This one is the pits. I can't say there is even one song I would listen to more than 2 times. Do youself a favor and buy a Megadeth CD instead."
2,Metallica R.I.P.,"I don't wanna say that it's that bad but it's definitely not creative. Almost all the songs are in ""E"", they seem to drag out, nothing from Kirk and that annoying gong sounding drum in the St. Anger single, well it's in every damn song. It's not Metallica. This the first CD I've bought in years due to high speed internet, I felt as a longtime listener back to Kill'em all, that I needed to show my support. And it even comes with a free DVD of bad music!Rest in peace"
1,Lars is a greedy piece of trash.,Lars Ulrich was the douche that started the big deal about people downloading albums from the internet. this is expected from someone that makes some trash. I image he did that because he was mad that everyone heard how horrible this album was before it was released and they all saved their money and didnt have to live the rest of their lives knowing they spent more than 50 cents on this absolute garbage.
1,SHOOT JAMES DEAD !! HE'S NOT DEAD YET !!,The truth is over and done with. This CD won a grammy. I guess after MTV and the record labels hyped the crap out of this record they had to give it the grammy award just to save some kind of face in their denial. What a waste. 2 + 2 now equals 5.
1,Metallica Gone Wrong,"I didn't think that it would happen, but it did. Metallica has turned into a commercial balloon that has been deflated for over ten years now. The once legendary greatness of this band has been drawn out to the extent that those that were there for the release of ""Kill 'Em All"" wouldn't even know this album was made by the same band. It's sad, I know, but they have faded into the musical realm of fallen giants. The entire album seems to be a sad attempt to relive the greatness of such albums as ""Ride The Lightning,"" and ""Master of Puppets."" Musically, this just falls flat on it's face. It's nowhere near the organization or careful planning as MoP or RtL, even ""...And Justice For All."" And the lyrics are just an old dog trying to use old tricks and pass them off as new ones. It's really a shame that such a great band has to stoop to this level. Rolling Stone can say whatever they want; this album, for lack of better words, sucks."
1,NU Metal,Man this suck this aint metallica they started to suck after (and justice for all) don't buy this crap
1,Master of Ducats,"I've been a Metallica fan since 1985. If anybody would try as hard as possible to like one of their albums, it'd be me.But it's just impossible with St. Anger.It's almost entirely unlistenable."
1,Eagle86,Could not agree more with the last tow this is one of the worst albums I have ever bought. Wish I could get my money back.
1,SAY WHAT,"Metallica,metallica,metallica.You rocked,rocked and now you suck. Why for the love of music would a band go from being king of the world,to king nothing?What can I say about metallica,besides,the music sounding like a poor garage band with tin cans and a toy guitar.And let's not forget the lyrics.They make absolutley no sense.James are you sober or finally drunk?Sorry for being so harse,but considering all the excellent music metallica had released prior to st. anger,this is a major let down.2003 is slowly becoming the death of rock n' roll.Are we all doomed to Nelly?If this is what hero bands are going to be.I guess the saying that the earth is really hell is true.Save us and take more time on the next release please."
3,"Better then the Load albums, but not much","The album is better than Load/Reload, but no way as good as it could have been. The album is much heavier and faster also. No way is it up to par with the first four albums. The recording quality is horrible. With the exception of a few songs, the music quality is also bad. The lyrics on many of the songs are not up to Metallica's earlier works. The best songs are Sweet Amber and The Unnamed Feeling. The DVD has a little better sound, much better instrument separation, but James' voice sounds worse. Part of the better sound may be attributed to Rob playing base on the DVD."
2,Practically Unlistenable,"While it is nice to see the band return to its ""thrash"" roots, the production and song arrangement on these songs are terrible. Firstly, it sounds like it wasn't produced at all, sad given the excellent production standards of the previous Bob Rock produced albums (starting with the Black Album). The drums sound like they were bought at Wal-Mart and James' vocals are grating.The songs have no sustained melody whatsoever, it's all very syncopated (title track St. Anger is a good example if you've heard it). Not like early albums like Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets, but unlike anything I've ever heard.There are maybe a couple songs I had any interest in listening again but if you take the worst song on any of the previous Metallica albums they all rate better than the ""best"" here.The bonus DVD is pretty cool or otherwise this album would only rate 1 star."
4,This is why I am a Metallica fan,"Take the Black Album, Load, and Reload and sell them back to a CD store. By far and away the best album since Justice. The masters of metal are back on this record. The DVD that comes with the CD is a must have, I suggest watching the DVD first to 'see' how these songs rock, then enjoy this CD for all its worth, super touch riff after riff and Lars going off, double bass included!!"
4,A Raw experience.,"Metallica once again raised the bar in new metal. This album is unlike the prior 3 albums they released. There is a ton of metal and not much else. It sounds like Metallica really wanted to just play hard and fast and express themselves as the leaders in Metal. This is not an album for the faint of heart, or those who like to listen to audio at a low level. I find the louder I crank it, the better it sounds! The best word I can think of to describe this album would be Raw. Thanks to the Mighty Metallica for delivering yet another CD that will undoubtedly change my life!!!"
3,"A bad album, but we couldn't expect anything else","There's no denying it, this album is terrible, it lacks the brilliance of Ride the lighting, and the sheer under-appreciated excellency of And justice for all.But could we have expected anything better? They're not getting any younger, in fact kirk hamnett seems to have aged at an accelerated rate. James is fresh out of rehab, the new guy [stinks], lars seems to live in court, which could be why the drumming sounds like a toddler messing about with some pots and pans, and james voice has been going downhill ever since reload.I also think they should give up the whole rebellion thing, most people grow out of their rebellious phase buy about 20, but metallica have dragged it out for 20 years.To sum up, metallica were a good band, freakin living legends, but they're past their best, as this album unequivically proves."
2,Somewhat dissappointing,"This cd is somewhat different than what they have done before. I like the music instrumentally except for the lack of Hammet solos. That is severely missed!! The biggest problem I have with this cd is the vocals. Don't get me wrong I love Metallica, but this cd the vocals just aren't there. The songs are a little too wordy and James tries to get to high in most of them. I don't think that is his strong point. I think they got away from what really makes them so great which is outstanding guitar and drum play and songs that never ever get old. Overall, it is ok, but nothing really new or ground breaking which I usually expect from Metallica. The included dvd is nice though."
1,no room for this album on theCDshelf of a real MetallicA fan,"the CD is okay if you are a fan of Slipknot, Drowning Pool, even Limp Bizkit. i dont mind mrtallica creating something like this...it's a good thing that they're not afraid of trying something new. but the problem is that they are forcing this album so much, and trying to persuade their fans that tihs is the best that's ever come out of the band, and it's worth having. this CD belongs to the new nu-metal generation, not the real heavy metal fans. after listening to 2 or 3 songs, the album gets boring. there is NOT ONE guitar solo part in the whole album, and there is no need for 2 guitars. the guitars are tunned low like any nu-metal band...they sound trashy and its hard to hear any melody. most of the songs should be made 3 minutes, instead of 9. overall this CD is a pretty big dissapointed for a loyal fan."
3,Metallica returns to punk metal roots,"First off let me say that Metallica is a great band with talented musicians. However, after hearing this last CD I dont believe that they have applied themselves well. If you are fairly new to Metallica(didnt get into them until Black), this CD will sound nothing like the Metallica your used to and most likely turn you off. If you've been with Metallica since the 1st cd, ""Kill em All"", you'll notice some simularities to their early punk metal roots and find yourself able to struggle thru the rest of the CD. The addition of Metallica's new bassist from 80s punk band ""Suicidal Tendencies"" drives them closer to that eras sound. Like other reviewers I agree that the bass, drums and guitar are good but Jame's vocals just kill the album. Buy this CD only if you are a hardcore Metallica fan otherwise it will be collecting dust."
3,Not their best work....,"This album wasnt as great as expected... James compared it to Justice... but it is far from it.... infact.. to compare it to justice is a crime... one solo... thats all i ask for... I MISS THE DAYS WHERE SOLOS WERE EXPECTED FROM A BAND... but at least they went back to metal and instead of that ...blues [stuff]. Frantic and st. anger are the best songs on the album... but still no justice... this is down and heavy riffs... but James is singing way out of his range and he sounds like a dieing drunk. So, to summarize my review...ST Anger-Better then Justice? NOWorse then Load and ReLoad? NO"
3,"This is not up to ""Metallica"" standards","I was so excited about this album. I have listened to it since the day I got it TRYING to like it. It has some good points but overall I was not impressed. It is not a bad CD but it lacks the cool guitar riffs and grooves of their past efforts. Also, as I have read over and over...NO KIRK SOLOS! Normally I have to listen to something a lot and get used to it before I really appreciate it, that is when I know it is good. I am REALLY trying to like this album. Maybe in another week or two it will grow on me more but as of now it seems like a mediocre album that any mediocre metal band could release. Metallica can do so much better, as we all know. It is cool though that they released a DVD with it. It is worth the money if you are a metallica fan but dont expect anything remotely like ""...And Justice for all"", ""the black album(?)"" or "" Master of puppets""..Hoep this helps...Give it a listen and form your own opinion..Everyone is different!"
3,"Not Metallica's best album, but it's actually okay.","Ok, we all miss Metallica circa 1981-1991. Kill em All was 30 years ago! Ride the Lightning was 29 years ago! Master of Puppets was 27 years ago! And Justice for All was 25 years ago! The Black Album was 22 years ago! So we must judge this album on its own merit, and honestly it's a decent album. Mind you, its not great, but if you really get into it, you end up liking it. This was Metallica's hardest and fastest album to date. While its not vintage Metallica, its still Metallica, and half assed Metallica is still better than most other bands!"
3,Don't Get Me Wrong,"Come back 'Black album', all is forgiven! Only kidding. St Anger is an ok album, I think why everyone rails against it is because the band hyped it as a return to their thrash roots (which it isn't really) and because each track is too long. Individually each track is amazing, they start powerfully and have great riffs and energy. But in my opinion, and it is my opinion only, they could all do with being three minutes shorter and then you would have an incredible album worth five stars. They all seem a little overlong and you get bored by the time the album is half way through. Metallica always were one of the greatest metal bands out there, sadly this isn't them at their peak.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Dissapointed,After listening to this album it leaves me wondering what direction are they heading in? Industrial rock or not it sounds like this album was recorded in a tin can. Perhaps their best days are behind them. The album deserves a 2 but I gave a 3 just because it's Metallica and they are capable of so much better.
3,welcome back,welcome back to the real metallica. great guitar riffs on this one although I am not convinced any of the songs will be metallica classics. james' voice has changed a lot throughout the years. I just hope they keep thrashin' again and shut the door to the load and reload sessions completely.
3,"Back to the primitive, simply ain't the same old metallica",Great Guitar riffs on this one. I'm glad they're back to the thrashin' old days. As of now I still don't know if any of the new songs will be a classic. James' voice has changed a lot through the years. I just hope they keep up the trend and leave the load and reload sessions behind them.
2,Nice Demo Version...NOT!,"Some good riffs but overall I am very disapointed. The mixing on this album is absolutely terrible. The drums sound like it is a demo studio album. I used to be a huge Metallica fan, but this album is by far their worst work. JMHO"
2,50-50 POP METAL,"This is by far the worst metallica album ever... They seem to be trying to apeal to the new ""pop metal"" crowd... Not only is it repetitive but there is no lead guitar... James' vocals need SERIOUS work and I dont know why they had Kirk sing at all..."
3,Wheres the solos,"I got this thinking this was them back to the old form. After 3 spins i am asking myself ""where is the guitar solos""? My other complaint is that Lars sounds like he is hitting a tin can? Not the old Metallica."
2,"Wow, was I ever disappointed","I read so many reviews that this new Metallica CD was going to be spectacular, so maybe I had my hopes a little too high going in. Even still, this CD is remarkably average.The drums sound horrible. The snare sounds like Lars is banging on a garbage can, and there's NOT ONE GUITAR SOLO on the record. None. What happened to Kirk? It's not just the drums that sound bad, either. The vocals are strikingly harsh.I listened to the whole CD right after buying it, and when it was over, it dawned on me that I couldn't remember a single song. There's nothing memorable about ANY one of the songs. NOTHING. The songs are all longer, they're faster, they're more complex. But that doesn't make them good songs.I've never sold a CD back to one of those used CD stores, but there's a first time for everything, right?"
3,"Fast, Heavy, Agressive, but has it's flaws","After waiting so long for this album, I will say it was worth the wait. It is a good album, and is very heavy. Tallica has a new sound in this one, some different distortions and Lar's drums sound different. Has some very heavy riffs that make this album kick [butt], but the biggest flaw is the lack of solos... I recommend this album to any hardcore metallica fan or metal fan, but if yer buying for guitar solos you will be disappointed."
3,"Not a great buy, Listen to sample first","Long time Metallica fan from the days of ride the lightening through Re-Load. This album disappoints in a major way. The sound quality sounds second rate, at best. I couldn't believe it. If I could have returned then CD, I would have. Very disappointed."
2,Something New?,"Few solos, heavy bass & drums, attempt at rap-metal... What was Bob Rock trying to do with these guys? Seventy-Five minutes of waiting to hear Metallica, only to hope for it on their next album. Ditch Bob Rock, more harsh vocals, less bass, bring back a solo or two."
1,Ummm what the heck happened.....,"Why the heck did they even release this CD...? I was looking for solos, driving beats, attitude, and generally good music. That is not what I found. And I'm not stuck in the 80's because I'm 17, but I guess wanting solo's could come from the fact that I play guitar. It used to be that Metallica was the holy grail of rock music, now they are the most outrageously horrid bands ever. I personally think this is the biggest waste on the face of the earth. THIS IS A DIFFERENT METALLICA THAN ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER DONE. I really don't know how to describe this travesty... Anyway, the drums most of the time have no musical beat, kinda like horrible punk music-just beat on it and who gives a *cough* about musical quality. The guitars are basically the same throughout the entire album, and the bass you really can't hear because of Lars killing his drums...I'll take it back if I can."
2,[Garbage],"As a big Metallica fan i had high hopes for St.Anger. This is a total disapointment. I cant get over Lars' snare! The reverb from the snare overwhelms everybody and everything. What happened Lars? Forget how to tune a drum? One other thing is missing. Kirk! There are absolutly no solos on this album. What ever happened to the kick [rear] solos? James' lyrics could stand some improvment, all the songs kinda sound the same and get predictable. Overal a big disapointment. Load and reload are better than this album!"
4,??,"Yesterday i hated this CD. Today i love it. I'm sure i'll hate it tomorrow, which is ok cause the day after i'll love it again."
2,St. Anger is a major disappointment,"I've been a fan of Metallica since I first heard Master of Puppets, and I've bought them all since. I even liked Load and Reload. Garage Inc., wasn't bad either. But St. Anger truly is bad. One of the other reviews I read said that all the songs sound the same; they do. They sound poorly produced, the guys sound like they were each in separate, sound-proof rooms during taping (i.e., everything is disjointed like they didn't know what the others were playing), and Hetfield's usually powerful vocals are flat and uninspired. I've listened to it repeatedly to see if it grows on me. It doesn't. In fact, I keep skipping songs to see if the next one is an improvment. It isn't. I normally listen to a CD before buying it. But this is Metallica -- so its got to be good right? Wrong. What a disappointment. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because they are least trying something different. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me."
2,What were they thinking...,"Okay, I've been a good Metallica fan for a while, but when I listened to this album, I was disappointed with the sound. Metallica has lost its sound. Its lost its feel. They tried to copy what they had and it just didn't work. At most I see two songs on the album that would be close to the Metallica Sound. Beyond that, they are searching again."
2,Bring Back Fleming Rasmussen,"Bob Rock is a terrible producer and an even worse bassist. James sounds like he's going through puberty in most of the tracks, Lars sounds like he's playing to a different song and Kirk just doesn't get any solo time. They have obviously lost their touch with the world and music that is being put out now. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because pushead is back after about 16 years. I'm not a new guy to Metallica at all, I bought Ride the Lightning on tape the day it came out and all the other albums the day they came out so I consider myself old school Metallica, but this is just [awful].If you want to listen to go really good new music, check out Anthrax's new album ""We've Come For You All"" awesome album, or check out Type O's new one, just don't buy this one. Get one of us who spent our money already to copy it for you and let it sit around after you listen to it once or twice."
1,Lars' Ego Finally kills Metallica,"It appears that Lars' ego has finally killed Metallica. There is a lot to like on this album, but it is hard to hear since Lars decided that he needed to be out front and drown out everything else. The annoying hollowness of the drumming is just too distracting. Too bad it was Jason who left and not Lars.If this album were re-mixed to tone down the drums, it would stand above Load and Re-Load. As it is, it is just too painful to listen to."
1,"YES to going back to heavy, NO to horrific drum sounds!","I'm sorry, but as much as I want to like this album, I cannot. I am very excited about Metallica going back to the heavy, aggresive stylings that got them to where they are today, but when Mr. Rock (producer) thinks he can blatantly increase the volume on certain bass drum hits (using Pro-Tools software) while Lars is playing amazingly fast double bass drum beats, and leaving in the snare drum ring on most every track that no honest low-fi producer in his right mind would ever do, is a sad day in rock n roll.It seems as though this album was just a little rushed."
3,My Friend of Misery,"First of I have been a fan since '83. This on took me off guard. It is not at all what I remotely expected. The same lyrics are repeated way to much and of course no solos. James to me can not sing on this albulm, sometimes it's ok, but overall, NOT. Rehab ruins music.But as a stand alone, I am growing founder of it due to it unique style or lack of. It is heavy and aggressive,""Frantic"" sounds like Slayer (which I like). Maybe it was intended to be simple subject, I wish it had not been a concept thing. Hope they don't do this again. It's worth the money but you will not be blown away by anything special, except mosh heaven."
1,Aspirin should be included.,We love metallica so much we have had hope of a good cd since 1991. better luck next time metallica fans.
2,Huge Metallica fan DISAPPOINTED :(,"What do ""New Coke"", the ""Herb"" Burger King campaign and the new Metallica CD all have in common? They're all flops.What can I say - I've been a huge fan since the beginning, but this CD blows! They hiped it up like it was going to be like their old stuff and I can tell you, if their old stuff was ever like this they would never have been signed.Make no mistake, everyone in the band is great at what they do - very accomplished musicians. But, the production value on the CD just doesn't work. Mainly the vocals and drums are what is so bothersome. It sounds like you are listening to a sound check or something. The lyrics are pretty weak too - they sound like they spent about 2 days writing them.I understand that they are trying to grow with the times and transform their music for newer fans, but leave that to the young guys. Metallica shouldn't have messed with a good thing.Bottom-line - save your money."
3,Over all Disappointment but St. Anger has some good stuff,"If you love the music of Metallica for the brilliant guitar solos, you will NOT like this Album. There is not one guitar solo in the whole album. In my opinion this seperates them from everyone else. The album still had some good stuff. I liked Frantic a lot and ST.Anger was good. The rest was just OK. Whatever Lars did to his drums sounded great. They definetly had a more aggresive sound than they did in Load and Reload. It sounds a little bit more like their old stuff. But still, with out the guitar solos they are just like everybody else."
1,I would had give it 0 stars if I could,"This one is by far:- The worst Album from Metallica,- The worst Heavy metal album ever (and from all of its categories),- The [worst] thing I've ever heard,- The worst sound I have heard in a CD. The bass and the guitar [stink], there are no drums, Lars seems to be just kicking some old cans. The sound reminds me about hearing 5 generation recording tapes 20 years ago,- The most stipid lyrics in a Heavy metal album- etc. etc. etcAt least there is some good thing: I did't buy this album, I've hear it from a friend and at least I will save my hard earned money...thanks Metallica, I'll never spend one more buck in you guys..."
1,"JUST STOP ALREADY, ENOUGH!",WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? JESUS! I WOULD BE ASHAMED TO RELEASE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS WITH MY NAME ON IT. NOT TO MENTION THE LOADS. OH MY GOD THIS IS JUST SH*T. THEY MUST HAVE MADE THIS IN ONE NIGHT AND KIRK HAD A SPRAINED WRIST. GET REAL YOU GUYS. I HONESTLY BELIEVE THE ORIGINAL METALLICA WERE REPLACED BY EVIL ROBOTS WITH NO SENSE OF GOOD MUSIC. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT BUY IT. UNLESS YOUR THE ANDREW W.K. TYPE THEN BY ALL MEANS WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
1,Remember when Metallica was...good?,"Metallica is, and most likely always will be my favorite band. The guitar solos and duets... The METAL sound... James' voice... But now they're just another sold-out rock band with terrible sound effects, bad drumming, almost zero decent guitar work, and the screaming electric voice that's so common today. I was ready for James to start screaming and someone to come on with a rap solo. Ugh.Go and get the Black Album, Load, Re-Load, Ride the Lightning, ...And Justice For All, and Kill 'em all. Then find some other band. Metallica's not worth it anymore."
2,Ouch...,"This is not only the worst Metallica album thus far, it is also some of the most forced sounding material ever written. I'm not sure why after not releasing a studio album for 6 years Metallica has produced something as talentless as St. Anger. Many people hated Load when it was released, well you'll cherish Load after hearing this album. Every song sounds similar to the last, and it's not a good similar, trust me. Spare yourself this album. If you want some good ""newer"" Metallica, get Load or Reload."
1,What the...,"We've waited six years for this...?!? Boring, unoriginal, unmelodic garbage that was the biggest waste of my money since, well, that Load/Reload fiasco. I was hoping those two were just a phase but unfortunatly they weren't. Metallica said they were going back to the ""Old School"" and it looks like they flunked out. Do us a favor guys, retire before any more poor souls waste another dime of their hard earned money on some trash you release while trying to relive your glory days of old."
1,The Nail In the Coffin.,"Well, they have finally done it. We all new it was coming.They have officially made a truly bad album.I dont care what any of you people say, this is a horrible piece of work. It boggles my mind how people can go on and on about the poor production, the lack of guitars, and the horrible writing, and still give this CD 4 Stars?It's time to face the facts people. This is not 1986 anymore, this band is done. Oh, by the way Lars, you don't have to worry about anyone stealing this one through the internet, I dont think many people want it.By the way, they can blame Bob Rock, he killed their career."
2,"This should be called ""St. Tuneless""","Wow,I cannot believe how lousy this record is!There are no MELODIES, the lyrics are bad, and the songs (I mean riffs) go nowhere... the band sounds kickass but the listener simply gets bashed in the head with directionless noise!The bonus DVD and artwork are nice but...we had to wait how long for this?!...sorry guys, but I think you've been hanging round MTV to much and listening to way to much Korn- this actually sounds like you are trying to ape them...Thank goodness we have all those great past records- this one gets traded in to my used CD store!Oh well, at least I have the new Iron Maiden to look forward to!!!"
1,metalli...!,"if this was any other band, this cd would've never been released. the production is terrible. the mix is so muddy, you cannot hear the guitars (and speaking of which, where are kirk's blistering solos?). james sounds like he gargled a bucket of rusty nails before singing (or should i say straining).i really wanted to like this cd too, cuz it's been way too long since metallica put out a good cd.go buy anthrax's 'we've come for you all', or some meshuggah instead."
1,FIRST CD I HAVE EVER RETURNED!,"I was quite shocked when I got this one. The band had promised that it was an album that was getting back to their earlier and harder roots. I guess not!! I have to agree that the vocals sound horrible, they all sound like James is trapt in a well or something! This is the first CD that I have ever returned in all of my 24 years of life, I was really disapointed in it!"
3,It's different,"As a Metallica fan, when I first listened to this CD, I was dissappointed. It just wasn't Metallica. After giving it another listen I'm starting to respect it. If you're looking for Kirk Hammett's kick-arse solos, or in fact any solos, don't buy this album. If you're into thrash metal and heavy guitars, or you're just a die-hard Metallica fan, this album is for you."
1,i'm so sad,"wow. that's all i can say. what happened to the grip 'em and rip 'em attitude when they dominated the metal world of the 80's. this was supposed to be the return to their roots (ie - a garage sound with heavy guitars, etc). to be blunt, this album is boring. where is kirk? there are absolutely zero -- count them -- zero guitar solos. is he even playing on the album, or did james demand he keep a low profile (probably like he did with jason newsted, which finally sent him packing his bags). if you wanna rock, buy the new voivod album."
2,"Sad, Very Sad","I never thought that I would see the day when Metallica would finally need to retire but that day is here. St. Anger is probably the worst album that Metallica has ever put out. The worst part about the actual music is probably the drums. It sounds like Lars is beating on tin cans. I thought that this album was a huge disappointment. I'm a metallica fan, but I probably won't be listening to this CD much. Maybe they're just getting to old or something?"
1,No Depth,"I have tried several times to get into the CD but I have been unable to. I usually don't like a CD the first time I listen to it so I tend to listen to a CD several times before I make a judgement about it, but after listening to St Anger numerous times I have yet to even remotely like it. The songs on the CD lack depth to the music, every single song is basically a guitar riff, a bass guitar riff, add in basic drums and then vocals, rinse, repeat. The music really reminded me of any garage band out there that just got together and were trying their own stuff. You would think with the many years they have been playing, they would be able to put out a better CD but this is not the case.If you want raw, unrefined, garage band style music, then this is the cd for you.If you want developed music with depth (like I do) then look elsewhere. This is not the cd for you."
4,I really like this one...,"I wouln't recommend it to a Metallica newbie but after listening to the other albums 1000 times i think it was time for something new. Some songs on this album sound very Nu-Metal ish, but with Hetfield melodic voice it becomes something different, being a fan of the Load era i think Hefields voice has just improved for the better.Like some people here, i would NEVER compare this to any of the 80's stuff, the riffs here are a lot easier and heavier (Reason: Downtuned guitars), but this doesn't have to be bad, of course if you're stuck in the 80's and hoping for another Master of Puppets, forget Metallica and don't bother making any more reviews of their albums."
1,Trash,"I gave this album a try, I wanted to like it so bad. But I can't, this is really bad music. Lars' snare drum sounds like he's beating on a tin can. James' lyrics are juvenile at best and his vocal chords are stretched. The songs are twice as long as they have to be. And there is not a single solo!!!!! Where are you Kirk? I'm sorry, but even though I hated ""Load"", as a Metallica fan, I could only wish for something like that. This album doesn't sound one bit like it would be from a seasoned rock band, one of the best in the world. It sounds like a second rate speed metal band. Metallica should do us all a favor and just stop making music altogether."
2,Sort of Disappointed,"I started listening to Metallica with the Black Album, thenended up aquiring all the CD's. Maybe it shows my age, butI really prefer the later music - Black, Load, Re-Load,Garage Inc., S&M; - and of course, their older trulyclassic songs like ""One"" ""Master of Puppets"" ""Fade toBlack"" etc. I don't really know what to make of thisCD. It's like nothing they've done before - doesn'teven sound like Metallica. It's the firsttime I WANT to turn the music down because I'm notsure at times if it's not just noise. Lars isannoying with his banging on the drums, and I hearnothing of Kirk. James, I love, but at times hedoesn't even sound like he's singing - merelyscreaming and off-key at times too.I miss the ballads. The whole CD is too much ofthe same. I don't know where the band's going, butI miss the so-called ""Sell-out"" music thatactually sounded like they could sing and play.Still a fan, though I don't know how much of thisnew music I could stomach before I'd stoplistening. Sad but True."
1,ONE more feeble effort to regain metal immortality,"They say they went back to their roots and got the foundation from RIDE THE LIGHTNING? ... Metallica sold themselves out years ago when they made the ONE video. All you ex-diehard Metallica fans remember when they used to say they would NEVER make a video, 'cos bands that did that were posers? 'Nuff said. Black album was somewhat of a good effort. But it is obvious they are making music now for the sake of making music. They're not LIVING it. They're not making music for US. They're making it to make $$$. Period. This album no way reflects Ride the Lightning. Or any of their pre-Justice works, for that matter. Time to put Metallica in the metal graveyard, God rest their souls."
3,"Not great, but...","I pretty much agree with all of the comments from reviewers who give this 1 or 2 stars. It isn't a very good Metallica CD. But it's better than a lot of music out there. It's not what I expected or wanted, but it will get played from time to time when I'm in the mood. And isn't all that bad, just not like earlier albums that could be played _anytime_."
2,What the heck happened?,"To say that I was disappointed with the St. Anger is an understatement. It's very hard to get through. Gone is the great melodic ""metallica"" rhythm. They grew so much as a band that this seems like such a setback. All this despite the fact that Bob Rock is still producing their albums. I didn't think there would be much of a dropoff when Jason left the band. He's probably is not the main reason this album disappoints, but it may be a start."
2,What the????,"I listened to it once, then I listened to it a second time and I am incredibly underwhelmed. What is wrong with it? Once you finish listening to it you go away not remembering a thing but a sonic assault of noise. I bet these guys weren't all in the same room when this was recorded nor did they listen to what the other musician had lain down when they put in their parts. The first album I ever bought by anyone where after 24 hours after buying it I gave it away to someone else. I just couldn't stand it anymore."
2,"A for effort, F for final grade...","I have to give Metallica credit for trying something new. The sound of the album was an obvious attempt to come up with a new sound that goes against the grain of what they have done before. Anyone thinking that the album was produced badly is wrong. At the level of popularity and prestige Metallica has a badly produced album just doesn't happen. They did this on purpose, folks. Unfortunately, the experiment failed. The album comes off amateurish and uninspired. You have to remember Metallica has made some of the best metal albums of all time. In context, this one just doesn't cut it. They will move onto something else.So as a fan of thrash, I just can't recommend this one; but a fan of experimental music might really like it. Honestly, listen to it BEFORE you buy it."
2,Metallica's mistake,"This was Metallica's mistake, no doubt. It was more mainstream than metal, and there were no catchy songs. Coupple songs were pretty good, but it still should've been better. And the worst thing is, NO SOLOs. A message to Metallica: ""You guys should play like you did in Ride The Lightning""."
1,Come on after five years this is all ya got..?,"I've always loved Metallica. Some o my favorite albums are metallica albums (master of puppets,ride the lightning. etc)i however was reall pissed off when i purchased St anger. What the hell is up with these guys? Some of the gretest musicians and this is all they can give. I bought this because of all the hype about it. but it really sucks. dont waste your 16 bucks"
2,Ugghh,"I don't know if Metallica has people registering to put decent reviews of this cd in here or what but... Believe the hype, it's bad. I don't know.. Maybe it could be better if the production wasent just god awful, and if they fixed James vocals, and my god... If they put a real snare drum on this cd instead of whatever Lars happends to have used for one. Thats what just kills it. The snare drum makes the cd pretty close to unlistenable.Just a drum you say? No... I don't think it is a drum at all. Its really that disturbing. I wanted so much to like this cd. I give it 2 stars over one because it comes with a full legenth dvd where they play the entire cd live, and it dosent sound half as bad."
4,It is better then what most people say!,"There has been a lot of controversy and negativity with St.Anger. People complain that there are no solos, production is lacking, repetitive etc...People expected a return to MOP but this is not it. It is something totally different and great in its own right. It's such a brutal album where the louder it is, the better it sounds. Hearing Metallica put some speed to these songs is awesome. On the title track, you can almost feel them slamming on the accelerator as the slower section transitions into the their tribute to damage inc. Oher songs like the unnamed feeling, sweet amber and all within my hands make me like this cd more and more every day. This is a cd that deserves multiple listens. It truly grows on you; I like it so much more then when I first got it"
1,Glad I'm not alone!,"I am yet another long time, die hard Metallica fan who anxiously awaited the release of this album. I bought it the day it came out without having listened to a single note. BIG MISTAKE!This has got to be one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. Needless to say, the worst Metallica album. It was a challenge to make it to the final track. I couldn't do it in just one sitting! From the terrible lyrics, to the extremely poor production, to the solo-less guitars, this was a total disappointment! Is this really Metallica? Is this some Milli-Vanilli hoax? Whatever it is, it's a lousy excuse for an album.Save yourself some time and money, stay away from this album!If you're a ""new"" Metallica fan, go spend your money on ""Ride the Lightning"" or ""Master of Puppets"", you'll get a alot more bang for your buck."
4,about dang time,"metallica long ago fell away from the type of music that they were once the defining band for - hard rock, a heavy metal type of music not revolved around guitar solos, the type of music that, to get the full effect of, you had to sit next to the speakers, crank up the bass, and almost get thrown around by the force of the music. they are no necessarily an 'angry' band, as the title may suggest, but here they return to the roots of the band, the type of music they made before their original bassist died. no more mainstream stuff that sounds a lot like the alternative bands that have been popular of late, they are making their sound very distictive, and if you don't like this ""new"" sound, then don't listen to it, but the diehard Metallica fans, who have been fans all along, this album is for you. The lyrics mean something and they still do repeat a lot, but they proved that they still know what heavy rock is still all about."
1,St Anger isn't half bad...It's ALL bad!,"This is by far the worst cd Metallica has ever done. Production, songwriting, playing, drumming, singing...it's all pure caca! It is a very BORING cd. The songs are all long, repetitious and there isn't even ONE solo. Why even have Kirk around? The drums...well...it sounds like a marching band. Very rhythmic but they just go in circles. There is no imagination on this album at all. And it seems to be as if James and the boys just said, ""Well, Im bored. Let's churn out some crap..You know kids'll buy it cus it's US!"" The fans got screwed...royally screwed on this cd. I was so mad...I kept hoping (PRAYING) that it would grow on me. I desperately hoped that, in a world where we have rappers on one side and pop drivel on the other, Metallica would come to the rescue. Alas! Metallica is dead. This album deserves no stars and the band should all end up with monkeypox! Cliff is surely spinning in his grave. Thank God we still have Pantera!"
1,No solos = No good,"St. Anger is definitely not worth buying just because there is not one guitar solo on the entire album. I have no idea why a band with one of the greatest guitar players of all time(Kirk Hammett) would leave out solos. I know Metallica was trying to write ""heavy"" music again, but they forgot to put any thought behind their songs. The lyrics are terrible, the drums sound like trash can lids, and the bass is undetectable. Although this album isn't as cheesy as Reload, I'm not sure if it's any better. If you want Metallica, listen to their first four albums, not this garbage."
3,Good; could've been better,"I've always loved Metallica. They have been pushing limits with every album they have released since day 1, including this one. When I heard that Metallica was coming out with a new ""metal"" album, I was all ears. Lyrics are great, Drums are great, Bass is great, Hammet's signature guitar solos that brightens up every song...non-existent. 8 minute songs, and no solos! What's up with that!? I was hoping for a more blues oriented album, with some sweet solos by one of the best guitarists in the world. But it's all thrash metal, and doesn't sound unique from other metal on the corporate radio we are forced to listen to. I suppose I will just have to wait until they get older."
1,had potential,this could have been a great album but the vocals & lyrics are terrible. What the **** was Hetfield thinking?
3,"Great album, but...","What the hell is Kirk doing? Kirk is without a doubt my favorite guitarist ever(Yes, more so than even Jimi or Randy), but I was deffinetly saddened when I listed to the whole album and was at a total lack of Kirk's solos...*sigh*The rest of the album is pretty good in my opinion. James is kicking [butt] and screaming again, Lars is just going nuts on the drums (although Bob Rock did mess up his snare drum so it makes this PING! PING! PING! sound, which gets kinda annoying after a while), and Whats-his-face-suicidaltendancies-guy is pretty ... good.Overall- A decent album."
1,I just cannot believe my ears!!,"This disk is complete crap! What in the hell are they thinking? These songs are filled with nonsensical garbage for lyrics, spewing from Hetfield's god awfull vocal cords. This CD is a complete waste of money and time. I've been a die hard fan for years and I've seen them live fourteen times over two decades, however, I'm very very disappointed. Sorry guys, you broke my heart."
1,Very disappointing...waste of 12 bucks...,"I heard this would be their hardest album since MoP, well maybe it's hard, but the songs blow. Rolling Stone gave this CD four stars...that completely baffles me...4 stars? This album [isn't good], plain and simple. It was a bitter letdown for me. I am totally confused by the production. Sounds like it was recorded on a $20 tape recorder while they played in a garage or someone's basement. How could they listen to this and think it sounded good? Have they all gone deaf? Do they think it sounds ""raw""? Well it doesn't. It just sounds horrible. The drums sound bad, the vocals are too loud and sound like [garbage], and the bass is washed out. Add to this the fact that there is only one song on this whole album that I would care to ever hear again, and you get the picture. It makes me sad."
1,An embarrassing record to be forgotten immediately,"I adored Metallica for 15 years, I like the first records and I like Load and Reload (therefore I am a so-called ""Fake"" fan, as kurlebj assumes).Why are there no 0 star ratings at amazon, if only for this album?Boring. Repetitive. Solos? Bad Lyrics. Bad sound. And boring. And no rhythm. Melodies? And Boring. And boring. and boring.A highly disappointed music fan."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This cd really disappointed me. Metallica has hit rock bottom. This CD was so bad, it was hard to listen to. Bottom line: DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1,Fran-Tic Tock Tic Tock..........time is up!,"Listening to this entire album reminded me of my last trip to the dentist. PAINFUL! I have the utmost respect for Metallica, but I do not understand where they were going with this particular album. Most songs start off in true Metallica style but by the time the vocals and the tin can drums start you might as well be hearing fingernails on a chalkboard. Don't get me wrong, I am all for band re-inventing themselves but when I hear that this album is being compared to ""Ride the Lightning"", that could'nt be farther from the truth. What is Sad But True is that for the first time in my life when I hear a Metallica song (Frantic) on the radio.........I turn the station. :("
4,Buy It,Do not listen to this album only once. You will hate it. I am an avid Metallica fan and after giving the record four dedicated listening sessions I must say that I think this is a very good album. At first I hated it and thought Metallica was dead but it takes some getting used to this new lo-fi sound. Lyrics and overall vocals are weak and there are no guitar solos but somehow it all works.
2,Another disappointment,"First off, the lyrics are simple. There's no true heart to this album. I'm not sure what the deal is with the tin can drums, but I'm sure Stewart Copeland from The Police could help them out in that department. I'm glad that there isn't bass distortion like on their previous albumns. Certainly miss the guitar solos that would sound sweet to your ears. Also every song almost sounds the same, but the tempo changes help....When you hear Metallica, you should be put back in your seat. This is not the case on St Anger. Still hoping for another And Justice For All albumn *fingers crossed*"
1,Just when you thought it couldn't get worse,"Once i heard even the first few seconds of this cd i wanted to throw it out the window. ... this is an embarrassment to what metallica used to stand. ... even Reload was better, at least it had at least a few good songs. Very dispointing indeed man, it sounds like they're trying real hard to sound like new metal style, the lyrics don't really flow or even have significance like they used, his voice is terrible, drums are sloppy and ... and where the ... is hammet in all this. This album has terrible orchestration, why won't they wake up and see that their true fans want the old style speed/thrash metal Metallica back, NOT what this. Truely if you compare Kill 'em all to this , there is a HUGE difference. Lets hope they'll change their back somewhat(or at least better) someday(when ever that is)"
1,Absolutely Ridiculous!,"I have given it my best effort, but I cannot stand this Album. I am a huge fan of Metallica, but they really have not put out anything new worth listening to since the black album. James sounds terrible, and lyrics are garbage. Who are they trying to be? Great guys, I'm glad you can still play really fast. Unfortunately, that is about it. I liked the start of the title track until I heard Trujillo barking on it. Who is he, that dude from Cypress Hill, it would have been better to hear Scooby Doo! Anyway, quit trying be the guys you're touring with and hang it up. I'm going to go throw on Master of Puppets and relax."
1,THE METALLI-LAMBS WILL ALWAYS SAY IS A GREAT ALBUM,"MTV- ICON??????Their first video was done when they counted 4 previous albums, and the story tells us that when they enter on the MTV slaves, they were necer the same band that HEADBANGERS used to love...For the record, ROBERT TRUJILLO DID NOT RECORDED THE BASS FOR THIS ALBUM, it was Bob Rock Who did it. And ROBERT DID NOT HELPED TO WRITE THE SONGS. READ THE ALBUM CREDITS ON THE ALBUM'S BOOKLET.THE SONGS ARE IN THE VEIN OF NU-METAL BANDS.... AND THEY ARE NOT SO FAR OF THE RE-LOAD ALBUM, THEY ARE REPETITIVE AND BORING.... IF YOU WANT TO HEAR TRU METAL GIVE A CHANCE TO BANDS LIKE CHILDREN OF BODOM.... OR SHADOWS FALL... OR LAMB OF GOD....BUT OF COURSE, IF THEY MAKE A TRUE METAL ALBUM... THEY WILL BE KICK OUT OF MTV, AND WE (THE METALLI-LAMBS) DO NOT WANT THAT."
1,Metallica being very un-Metallica,"What happened here? Is this another band named as the once great Metallica? James Hetfield sounds like an old man, no power, guitars are weak. It is their worst album ever. All this time of waiting for nothing. I was fooled by the title song where you can hear a Lars Ulrich beating the drums, this song is average but the others...I don't know, it's sad.I hope Metallica can re-think their whole concept again and give us former fans real headbanging metal, if the still can."
1,One of the worst albums that I have ever heard,"I'll make this review short and sweet.1. The production is poor; it sounds like it was recorded in one take on a tape deck.2. Lars sounds like he's banging on trash cans.3. The Lyrics are trite.4. The songs have no melody, hooks, or guitar solos.5. The album sounds monotonous, like one, long, awful song."
1,Justice is Served (ZERO STARS!!),"Here's the bottom line for St. Anger: 1. James Can't Sing 2. James Can't write lyrics 3. Bob Rock can't play the bass 4. Kirk apparently can't solo anymore 5. Lars still thinks he's a much better drummer than he really is. All in all, this ""album"" is a disgrace. But this comes as no surprise to me since their last good album was in the '80's! Move on to some real metal and pick up Napalm Death's latest ""Order of the Leetch.""..."
5,Face It.,I know alot of you metalli-bashers are saying that this album sucks. Well your wrong this album is very original and just fun as hell to listen to. Okay there aren't any three minute solos (try not to cry about it okay). hopefully someday it will get the credit it has earned. (so do try to open your mind a little and give it another try)
2,The End !,"Let's face it, Metallica is over for all of us, true fans from the 80's. There won't be more ""Master of Puppets"" or anything like it. We are no longer their market. It's hard to swallow but it is !The song I really liked was "" shoot me again "". ""Frantic"" and ""St Anger "" are ok. My main complaint about this album is that is not melodic at all. No guitar solos and drums are too loud."
2,"Cliff Burton, where are you?","Come on everyone, put your shovels away. I know it's not Ride The Lightning. But what is? These guys are obviously mortals, just like you and I. They can make mistakes, and this album is definitely one of them. What are you all, a bunch of Phillies and Eagles fan? Let's just put this cd behind us and move on. Not too long ago, Metallica used to be the best band on the face of the earth. They just need to regroup, find themselves again, and another Master of Puppets is just around the corner. We hope. On the other hand, we all have the right to ask, ""Geez Lars, what the #@$# happened?"""
4,"New direction, still on course.","Metallica has been annoying their fans since the self-titled ""Black Album"". Most would like to see ""And Justice For All"" re-hashed, re-packaged, and re-released every couple of years. Luckily for us, this is not the vision that the band has. ""St.Anger"" is in many ways a far cry from what we would consider a Metallica album. One thing missing is that trademark crunch that has set the bar for what is the definition of ""heavy"". At some point in most of the songs on this album, the drum beat is nowhere in sync with the guitars or the bass. However; they seem to make that work. If you are looking for a slick and polished recording - look elsewhere. If you are looking for Heavy Metal that is raw and undefined - you came to the right place. ""St.Anger"" is different, but a step in a new direction."
4,METALLICA IS BACK AND MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER,"AFTER TAKING 5 YEARS OFF FROM THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, METALLICA IS FINALLY BACK AND THEY'RE MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY EVER WERE BEFORE. THIS IS METAL AT IT'S FINEST. THIS IS DEFINITELY METALLICA'S BEST ALBUM SINCE THE BLACK ALBUM. ''FRANTIC'', ''ST. ANGER'', ''INVISIBLE KID'', AND ''SWEET AMBER'' ARE DEFINITE CLASSICS. THE LAST 3 SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE A BIT OF A LETDOWN, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, METALLICA TURNS IN A VERY GOOD ALBUM. AND IN ADDITION TO THIS CD, THERE'S A BONUS DVD IN WHICH YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE METALLICA IN THE STUDIO REHEARSING THIS ENTIRE ALBUM. FOR FANS OF METALLICA, THIS IS A SURE HIT."
1,What a joke,"Im 100 percent positive what I am about to say has already been said a bunch of times already, (I know im not the only real Metallica fan) but im going to say it anyway. Lars drums sound like tin cans, James singing sounds like all the other whiny Curt Cobain impersonators, there are no solos and both Kirk and James downtuned the guitars to make them sound like every other bland derivative crappy band out on the mainstream market. I don't care about the whole selling out thing, I just want a good disc to listen to. This album has absolutely no redeeming factors. By the way what is up with every song having two minutes of material repeated four times to create a eight minute bore fest. Avoid at all costs."
1,Not Worth A Star,"I am absolutely of the school that Metallica's first four records are the pinnacle of their career, and no one who truly has any concept of truly inspired music would disagree. Though the Black record has moments, it's sad and transparent of the music to come from Metallica.This record is the saddest effort and most transparent effort of a band that that should have died gracefully with Cliff Burton.A terrible shame."
2,WOW........this really.......sucks,"ive been listening to tallica for 10 years or more........what a waste of talent on this album....if u want some REAL metal....go pick up iced earth's new album ""the glorius burden""...or overkill's ""kill box 13""...im gonna give it 2 stars....one for being around for 20 years.....and 2 for 1983-1988 of killer metal"
2,ewww,"this cd is horrible, the first 2 tracks are good but after that it is hard too keep from vomitting. Metallica tricked us into buying this."
1,Depressingly boring!,"Dull. That's all I can say about this album. There is no variation whatsoever in the, sometimes absolutely tuneless, barrage of mindless metal. I do not really mind Nu-Metal, but Metallica are not Nu-Metal. They were never supposed to be Nu-Metal. They are meant to be Thrash Metal, and Thrash Metal they should've stayed. Metallica, once one of the greatest ever Thrash bands, are now among the worst Nu-Metal bands. For great Metallica, check out Master of Puppets."
1,What a disappointment.....,"I have to admit, I was anxious about this album. I was thinking: ""Wow...new Metallica....it's been so long since we have had some original material from them...so it has to be good!"" Boy, was I wrong. I ran out and bought this album on the day of release, hoping for something akin to THE BLACK ALBUM or LOAD/RELOAD. What I got was a thrashing! The whole album just sounded like a bunch of noise and screaming vocals. It's not very enjoyable. I like a little melody in my rock music. Their BLACK ALBUM is by far the best that Metallica has ever done....and after this I am convinced that it will be hard to beat it. The only other great song by Metallica is ONE off of the ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL album. Trust me, save your money on St. Anger. Go back and buy some of the older Metallica stuff...it's much better!"
1,sad sad sad,"This album is one of the most dissapointing albums you will ever hear. Especially for MetallicA's die hard fans who never expect anything below perfect from them. It was hard for me, a HUGE MetallicA fan, to hear Lars drumming on what sounds like tin cans, and for the rest of the band to be drowned out by that horrible sound. I recently bought tickets for an upcoming MetallicA concert, and im hoping they wont play too many of their new songs, and will just stick to the ones that made them famous. Comparing ""St. Anger"" to ""The Black Album"", ""Ride The Lightening"", ""Kill 'Em All"", ""Master Of Puppets"", & ""...And Justice For All"" shows how much they have changed and how horrible this album really is. Its hard for me to convince people that MetallicA is the greatest band that ever lived because of their newly released album...needless to say, i couldnt sit through the whole thing without getting sick. x-pOh by the way DON'T GET THIS CD!!!!! Peace out to my Fellow MetallicA fans..."
1,Oh man. Anger is right.,"This is terrible. From a band that once produced a masterpiece like ...And Justice For All... That's it. These guys are old and I hope they've been investing in a IRA because they need to retire. Oh well, at least we have bands like Iron Maiden that can come back and give us quality material like they did in the past. Not all bands sell out on their fans like these guys..."
1,$hit Anger - (-5) $tar$!,"What a di$appointment! Man, I never thought that Metallica could reach that down! $t. Anger i$ terrible!!! $imply terrible!!!! There are no memorable $ong$ ($ongs???) and there are no feeling!!! Wor$t: there are no $olos, and the new ($hit) metal influence$ jump$ upon your face! Ju$t to have an idea: $t. Anger make$ me mi$$ the Load$!! Or even the Garage Day$ crap! PLEA$E, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!! AVOID THI$ ITEM! AVOID THI$ PRODUCT!! IT'$ PURE CRAP!!! I GAVE ONE $TAR BECAU$E THE $I$TEM DON'T LET ME GO ZERO, BUT THAT'$ HOW IT I$!!"
4,This is how its done,"This CD totally kicks. Its harder and more aggressive than anything Metallica has done in the past. It is a return to classic tempo changes and lightning quick riffs, but is totally new in every other way. The songs are long and complex (like Justice) and despite what other people are going to say, there are parts with some MELODY (did anyone even listen to the title track? and what about the Unnamed Feeling or Sweet Amber?). Sure I do miss the solos and for those of you saying Kirk is MIA, just check out the DVD. He's there kickin as always and his hair is long so stop bitchin. Also, the extras (DVD, metallica vault, and LOW price) should be enough to appease those complaining about Metallica hating their fans and selling out. This CD is pure energy and each track grows on you more with repeated listens. Metallica sounds rejuvenated, clear-headed and ready to kick all our for years to come."
3,huh?,"Return to Metallica's roots? [what] are they talking about? There aren't even solos on this record. Either way it's not bad, but it's definatelly not ""old"" metallica like they claim it is."
2,ST. ANGER; A PEDESTRIAN OUTING,"Well I was at the store so I figured sure why not. This CD with it's extra DVD is a typical attempt by the Electra to hide the fact that the music basicly sucks, with ""extras"". It's like when you go to a resturant and order a meal, and the serving is HUGE, but unfortunately the food sucks, so whats the point. No hooks, lousy singing, the playing is uninspired, uninteresting, loaded with obscene language to impress the twelve yr. olds. So now Metallica is well entrenched in that inevitable period of their careers, family life, kids, rehab, investment portfolios, and oh yes the music."
1,Stir Fried [[garbage],"DOn't believe the propaganda out there that this album is a return to the GLory days of Justice,Puppets,and Lightning.THis album is worse than the Load albums.I've heard band members say in interviews that this album was going to be far less radio friendly than the last two but it's not.It's top 40 metal just like the last two Pieces of garbage they tried to pass off as Metallica albums.I feel cheated....James RAPS on this album.Nuff Said"
3,metallica fan from day one,"Good ""back to basics"" album. The drums leave something to be desired. Doesn't sound as well rounded as before. As for everything else I must say I actually like this album. Since when has metallica kept with the norm. All the songs give you something different each time you listen to them. ""Some Kind Of Monster"" will grab hold and shake you to your roots. ""Purify"" will get your blood going. I would only get this album if you are a true Metallica fan and willing to go through alittle change with them. Worth more than one listen before making a bad review."
1,This is terrible,"The only way you can like this album is if you like hearing a tin drum being pounded on monotonously. If you do, buy one of those wind-up chimps; cheaper and more talent.How anyone could write that they used ""Ride the Lighning"" as a template is beyond me. This drivel sounds NOTHING like that album.Stay away from St. Anger!"
4,Once Again Back On Top Where They Belong!!!,"Metallica is once again back on top where they belong. MetallicA is not your ordinary heavy metal band. They can sing and play so much more than just one type of music. They are so good that they are able to play things more than just the same way all the time. This album just adds to their history, and the continuation of their greatness. The whole band really pulled together for this one--including Bob Rock!!! This cd isn't like anything they've really done before and that is what makes this band and this cd awesome!!! Definately buy this cd!!"
1,Saint Dissipointment?,"This really should be called ""Saint Angry"" or just a shear ""huge"" disappointment from these guys? I can't believe Bob Rock would release this with his name on it too? I have been a fan of Metallica for many years and this by far is their worst lack luster effort from them?This album is nothing more than pure demos stung together to make an album? The sound and drums alone just stink. Where are Kirk's familiar guitar solos? The lyrics alone are poor quality in themselves?Maybe the loss of Jason Newsted from the band ""did"" have an effect on the material Metallica have decided to put out this time? Makes you think what their next combined effort will really be like once Robert Trujillo has a chance to actually write his own ""bass"" portions instead of Bob Rock on Bass guitar? I will stay optomistic for something better from Metallica in the future."
3,Its better to burn out...,"This is a solid (and very heavy) effort by Metallica. Does it deserve 1 out of 5 stars? No. Does it deserve 5 out of 5? Definitely not.Its great to hear the heavy sound again, but for the first time, it sounds as though Metallica is copying other bands. They are starting to sound just like all of the other modern metal bands out there (ie. Korn, Godsmack...etc.) The only downfall is that they seem to be too old to pull it off like those bands do. James Hetfield's voice sounds like it is straining a lot. The lyrics on tracks such as ""My World"" and ""Shoot Me Again"" tip-toe on the precipice of cheesiness (His ""oooh-oooooohh"" interlude on ""Invisible Kid"" is almost laughable). Also, the reverb effect on the drums is a cool sound, but after awhile it just starts sounding like a child banging incessantly on pots and pans.Resonably solid effort, just not enough memorable material to make it a classic."
2,Good thing Jason left....,"WOW!!! I was all excited when I heard that they had a new album coming out, saying that it would be heavier then some of the latest ones. Got it, popped it into the player, and my jaw droped. I had no idea what to expect other then the single i heard on the radio. ... To me all the songs pretty much sound alike, just like jazz music. All the insterments are playing something different and not together like before. If your into metal save your hard earned cash, but if your into ""metal jazz"" go pay the $.. or so for it.."
1,Worst album ever.,"This ""album"" is truly the let down of the year. So much for Metallica returning to their roots. Each song is worse than the one before it. It sounds like a bad Metallica cover band. Hetfeilds voice is shot. Lars snare drum sounds like a metal garbage can. Bob Rock is not a bass player and should not have played on the ""album."" That's just the band being cheap and not wanting to pay another musician. And Kirk's soloing is mediocre at best. I actually called Elektra records and asked for the 73 minutes and 4 seconds of my life back. This and every other Metallica album in my collection are now in the trash can. I'm officially done with this band."
4,It's not that bad,"This album is not as bad as people say in their reviews. While it is true that the album sounds horrible, the songs are good. Frantic and St. Anger are both great songs, and so is ""The unnamed feeling"", just to name a few. The drums are very loud, but don't sound as bad as some people say. It's really the guitar-sounds that really(...). The guitars sound way too muddy, so at times it's hard to hear what is actually being played. This album is not the melodic Metallica of the Black album and (Re)Load, and it is also not the pre 1991 Metallica. This album is something completely new. I just wish the album sounded better. If you can get over the sound of this record you'll be able to appreciate this effort. Just don't expect any ballads."
1,Metallica's Worst Album!,"What happened to Metallica?! Kirk, why aren't you playing fretboard melting solos anymore? James,why aren't you writing proper and traditional lyrical structures with proper verses,choruses and bridges? Lars, why does you drumming sound all metallic, and not like real drums? And why did Metallica use Bob Rock for bass? James and Lars shouldn't allow Kirk to be involved with any of the writing for the next album. They should make him play crazy solos on every song again. What ever happened to the melodies, harmonies, and ballads that they created many moons ago? Please come back for me and the rest of the Metallica fanbase on this entire Earth! One other thing that needs to be done is for Bob Rock to be ditched. Metallica needs a guy like Phil Spector or Mutt Lange to produce their next album. They need a insane genius to help them create artistic albums that they created many years ago!"
1,What can i say...,That hasnt already been said this is terrible and i hope someday everone will know thatNot even Master of puppets can conpinsate for this piece of garbage...
1,Are you kidding me?,I was 15 when Kill 'Em All came out and have been a fan ever since that album. These guys were innovators and now they are poor immitators at best. This isn't a band evolving. This is a band with no clear direction or unique sound anymore! Metallica was once the metal standard. What the hell happened? It is a sad day for metal fans worldwide. I wish I could give them zero stars because this CD deserves no praise whatsoever!
3,What the hell are they doing?,"Not a Metallica album. The songs seem all the same. No solos!! Bad singing. Bad songs in general!! There is no way that a metallica fan would find this mix of thrash, hardcore new wave of american something hard rock as the band seems that they don't know what they are doing. They should first rethink about their identity as a band and the path they want to follow and then make a damn record. Or maybe they have simply gotte too old. Somebody please stop Ulrich from hitting the drums that way!! I believe this album to be a dissapointment to fans and inferior to load-reload albums due to the fact that it lucks creativity and all the above."
1,Strange...,"Funny how everyone thinks Rob Trujillo is a great addition to the mix....yet he didn't play the bass for the recording of the album. That would be mostly Bob Rock is a great addition to the mix. Now, I don't want to bash Bob Rock he's a genius at his job, which isn't a bass player...bass lines seem a bit weak. Jason Newstead...that's what they need."
4,Their Best since Black!!!!,"Not a bad album. It is a lot heavier than any album previous to this one. Do not expect it to sound like their 80's work. If you are a Metallica fan it is well worth buying. It is the best album since the black with the exception of Garage Inc. Disk 2.The biggest problems with the album are the lack of Hammett guitar solos and the fact that it almost sounds like you are listening to one song.Lars' Drumming is hard and fast, James' Vocals are O.K. (better than Load and Relaod), and new bassist Rob is a great replacement for Jason.The Bonus DVD is cool and is agreat bonus, making this CD a good buy for any Fan."
2,"Not the Metallica I grew up with...but oh, well....","Yes, I've been a fan since highschool during the 80's and Metallica has evolved over the years. I've liked songs from all their releases so far but I'm hard-pressed to say I like a whole song on this one. Just when I start to like a riff or part of a song they do something so annoying that I have to go to the next song. If I had to pick a favorite song it would be ""shoot me again""....but it doesn't sound like a ""Metallica"" song. Now that James is sober, singing is really different...esp the clean parts...not so good. The snare sound is really bad. Kirk sounds like he didn't show up to record this album... I appreciate that they are trying to move in new directions but this is not really the direction I would have hoped for...I'm sure that newer fans will like this but old school fans will be disappointed for sure. It's not the Metallica I grew up with but oh, well ...they can do what they want...It's Metallica."
1,Nu-Metallica is not Good Metallica,"This album is a disappoinment to anyone who who has ever been a fan of Metallica. Shoddy production values and not one ounce of creativity leave the band exposed as a tired bunch of has-beens. The lyrics are worse than even those on ""Reload"" and Kirk's guitar playing is a hard to spot as Jason's bass was on ""Justice."" If this disc had been recorded by any other band, it would be the last thing anyone ever heard from them.If you decide to inflict this album on yourself, listen to the DVD version first. The production, although weak, is still a hundred times better than the actual CD. And if you really want to listen to a good metal album, save your money for Superjoint Ritual. I guarantee you'll get a pure dose of authentic American metal, not the watered-down Nu-metal of a band that is no longer relevant in the scene in helped to create."
2,Not that good...,"Totally disappointed...Not a bad metal album, but not a good metallica one...I do not agree with the other...The sound is to far from metallica's sound (remind me a bit RATM's sound...But fits more to RATM than to Metallica)...No real melodic songs, no real powerfull one too, no change of rythme (they all seems written with the same bit and same rythme)...Where are the songs like ""The things that should not be"", ""Enter Sandman"", ""One""???...No really not a good metallica album"
5,What a relief...,"Metallica back to their roots. This album explodes. A chief complaint I have of many bands is that they get soft over time as they try to create more commercially acceptable music. Just look at Queensryche, Ratt, etc. Cheers to the Metallica boys for bucking the trend and giving long-time fans a little shot in the arm with some old school metal. What a relief..."
1,amazingly bad!!!,"I have followed these guys for alot of years. Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Kill 'em All were the revolution in music that the world was needing. What is tis Junk?St. Anger is just a bunch of no good noise. What were they thinking? with the Napster issue and now this...Metallica is so far away from where they started. They had the oportunity the blow the world away after finding their roots with Garage Inc.They let us down..I always will like the old stuff. As far as I am concerned they are has-beens now."
3,WEAK Production,"The production on this album is awful. Terrible snare drum sound. Not a good guitar sound at all. The bass playing was done by Bob Rock, not Robert Trujillo, so I can forgive the weak bass lines. Overall, the songs are good. None of them really stand out, though. James voice sounds raw, which is good. Kirk seems to have forgotten how to play with emotion. Lars drumming is fantastic!! I just wish his drum sounds were better. I have listened to this in full only 3 times. Hopefully it will grow on me the more I listen to it."
1,"AWFUL Waste of time, talent and money","This is by far the worse album I have ever heard. I guess I'm not the only one who hears coffee cans. This album just goes to show when you're on top of the world you can beat on whatever you want, call it music and try to sell it. . . If this is what we have to look forward to as the future of Metallica, I'm wearing a blind fold!"
1,I gave it away,I couldn't even keep this CD in my collection for fear that it would poison all my other CD's and bands that I liked would suddenly forget how to make good music and would start putting out crap just to get another pay day. I don't know what happened to these guys but this album is horrible.
1,"You Think You're Entertaining Your Fans, ha?","This album is by far the worst metallica album!!! It hurts my ear, it duzn't even end...it's 75 minutes of headache, none of the metallica-ic sounds you've ever heard is here, don't waste your money buying this cd. and this ozzy bass man is so out-of no-where!!!! what did they think when they were making this s***? this is worst that nothing and any underground band could do it, Noise, Headache, and more noise, Metallica Shame On You!!!"
5,This is the best that Metallica has ever done!,"This CD is great! I like every single song that is on here.Everyone says this CD sounds like a load of s**t. They arewrong. It is great. St.Anger is the best song that is on here and Frantic is the second best. People say that when Lars beatsthe drums it sounds like tin cans. Well they are not tin cans,they are drums. If you do not believe me, watch the DVD.You willsee that they are NOT F***ING TIN CANS WHEN HE BEATS THE DRUMS!If you do not like this CD then you are not a true Metallicafan beacause this is the best CD that they ever made."
1,Just awful,"Having given up on the band years ago I was excited to hear they were going ""back to their roots"". What a farce! This is atrocious; a cop-out, talentless pile of rubbish! The production as most have noticed is abominable, the vocals about as bad as they get and the drum sound is trash. Take into account the band have completely lost the ability to write songs and you have the makings of a true disaster. This is utterly shameful. But, should I expect anything good from this band after 10 + years of garbage? Metallica is still OVER!!"
1,GOOD GOD! WHAT HAPPENED?!,"Earlier this year when I heard Metallica would have new material out for the summer, that's all I needed to be sold, initially. Then, I heard they were going back to their earlier sound. I figured stuff similar to Ride The Lightning, or ...And Justice For All, which all rocks. I decided, just in case, to listen to a few tracks before I would buy this album. Boy, was that a good choice! I saw the video for St. Anger, and that was also the first time I heard the song. I absolutely could not believe what I saw and heard! Horrible drum sounds that don't even classify as music, guitar riffs that made you scream, and terrible vocal harmonies, if that's what that is. If an album does not strike me as good at first, I give it some time, and eventually, I grow into it. I've given ""St. Anger"" several months now, and the more I think about it, the more disappointed I am. My Metallica collection will do just fine without this atrocity."
1,Please !!!! SHOOT YOURSELF !!!,"OK, una sola palabra para describirlo: TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!Que coño le pasa a la gran renombrada METALLICA... ????No gasten su dinero por favor!... por el bien del Heavy Metal!El pobre de Cliff Burtton debe estar revolcandose en su propia tumba al ver en lo que se a convertido Metallica..."
1,St. Anger ... Not that good,"St Anger was a big disappointment. I was expecting alot more out metallica. It sounds like it was recorded in a basement and many of the songs sound the same. Plus,I don't know why they tried to go back to the old stlye of music and not have one good Kirk Hammett guitar solo. Plus Hetfield shouldn't be singing like the vocals on load and reload when the music is master of puppets. The too don't mix. They could have looked harded for a knew bassist too. Bottom line DISAPPOINTHENT ...SNOWLEOPARD MAFIA..."
2,What happend to Metallica?,"I gave this album two stars out of respect for Metallica. Now on the the review. I am totally disappointed with this album. For the last two months I have been waiting for the return of Metallica, but they should have stayed away. All the hype said Metallica was going back to their roots, boy were they wrong. What is up with the lyrics? I swear each line of every song is repeated at least three times. Then you have Lars, what were you thinking? The drums were not only too loud, but just sounded off. It seemed as if during the fast areas of certain songs Lars would get lost and just bang around til the next section. I am glad that James is off alcohol and out of rehab. The band is still ""together"", but I wish I could go back to ragging on the guys for the Load/Reload ordeal. I have to say that either one of those CD's are better written and better produced than St. Anger. I think this is an embarassment to Metallica and to their fans."
4,St. anger is great give it a chance But needs solo's,"eventhough st.anger has a raw sound nobody likes its still great.Frantic 4/5 probably 2nd single. Good shorter songst.anger 4/5 1st single. a little repetive but goodsome kind of monster 3/5 too long of a songdirty window 4/5 Excellent songInvisible Kid 3/5 dont like song much too longMy world 2/5 Definetly worst on album too boring.Shoot me again 5/5 Finally a good song awesome guitar in the songSweet Amber 5/5 Great song. Awesome openerUnnamed Feeling 10/5 Best song. My choice for a single.Purify 2/5 my choice for worst after my worldAll within my hands 3/5 everyone likes this song but i dont muchAs you can see its not metallicas best but its not there worst. It would be more great if it had solos, especially in unnamed feeling."
1,Horrible,"Not even deserving of 1 star. I have been a fan for years and accepted the changes of their music in ""Load"" and ""re-load"", but this is crap!! Sound quality and production is way too muddy, drums sound like a small child banging on pots and pans, and not 1 solo on the whole cd!!! C'mon...change isn't a bad thing but change for the better. If you are a metallica fan, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! I already sold mine back to a used record store and took the loss."
1,Terrible,"In comparison to Kill 'Em All, theone true great Metallica album this is just plain crap. Lars' drumming tops it off, its ridiculous. Not a hint of a solo from Kirk either. Many people say the black album was the turning point of Metallica. I say losing Mustaine very early on was the real downfall. The songs Mustaine wrote on Kill 'Em All dwarf these petty new songs. Another terrible release like Black, Load, Re-load etc. from a band who really should stop now before they embarass themselves even further."
1,Worst band ever,"Worst drummerWorst lead guitaristWorst singing (including the dismal backing vocals)The only thing this band has is energy, fans and money"
1,The Lowest of the Low,"I thought Load and Reload were disappointments but this is beyond horrible. 75 minutes of demo-quality uninspired riffs, drum barrages (think empty oil cans) with no sense or purpose. 75 minutes of substandard (to say the least) vocals and no guitar solos whatsoever. No stand-out songs (the whole thing sounds like one 75-minute long boring song).This one will disappoint long time fans (who like the first four albums); drive away meeker bunch hooked on ""Enter Sandman"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""Until It Sleeps"" and definitely won't recruit new ones.Even some nu-metal bands sound better than this."
4,Give them credit...,"I agree, this album is not the Black album, or any other album they have ever released for that matter. Those albums are in the past. Now I must admit, Lars' snare took me by surprise and the lack of ""Kirk""-ness was a bit of a let down, but what we have to realize is that deep inside of this record is everything Metallica stands for: Heavy, Hard, Fast, and WE WILL DO WHAT WE WANT. There is no, and I mean no, other music out there right now that goes along with this album. The sound, the mystique, of this album is the fact that the boys have changed. These are grown men, some with families, some with a new found light on life, and I do commend them. KEEP ON ROCKIN' BOYS!!!"
1,Get the Noose,"Lars won't have to worry about anyone stealing(downloading) his music from this CD. Nobody in their right mind would want to waste the time. Major praise must be sent to Bob Rock for reaching a new high in his role of the Anti-Christ of metal. Never before has a CD been so poorly produced and has a major label CD sounded so bad.Metallica dudes.... what happened??? We all saw you on MTV banging out tunes to perfection from Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets. Guys, you can still play! Quit screwing around with this garbage and play!"
1,TIME TO UNPLUG THE GUITARS,"It's time for Metallica to give up, and save their longtime fans from any more suffering. I hate all the songs on this album. Metallica shouldn't ruin their reputation any more than it already has. I am embarrassed for them. Please don't waste your money on this album."
2,don't waste your money,"this is the most underproduced piece of [stuff] i have heard from a band with the resources and talent that metallica has. if they were going for a raw garage style they seriously exceeded their goal. the riffs are unclear, the vocals are scratchy, the base is nonexistent, and the drums sound like tin trashcans (listen for the snare). this thing was horribly mixed and i am in awe that metallica actually could be proud of this effort. the saving grace in this album is the promise that is shown in the songs however they sound like unfinished demo riffs that are cut and pasted together at the last minute. the disappointing thing is that i could hear the beginnings of an album that could be something good. but i have to say that metallica really blew this one. those people who were upset at the load albums (i wasnt one of them) now have something to be really irretated with. don't buy it. just don't buy it."
1,Can't believe it,"This albun really suks, I can't believe how bad these guys are geting, remember ride the lightning?"
4,A mix of the old Metallica and the newer Metallica,"St. Anger, the latest release from Metallica blends the band's early use of speed metal, aka Master of Puppets and Kill em all, with the bands more recent forays into heavy southern rock and dirty production. Gone are the ballads, the radio friendly four minute singles and any semblence of a guitar solo. All replaced by seven minute songs with time and key changes that come from seemingly nowhere. The album rocks for seventy minutes straight. These songs will get your head banging but will leave you a little perplexed. You will be asking yourself why the production value is terrible. The drums sound like ping pong paddles hitting a ball and the bass is non-existent. More is expected from Bob Rock. The album is saved by the live DVD included with early shippings that contains every song on the cd performed live with powerful drums and bass mixed in. Overall, an interesting and good new sound for Metallica to return with."
1,St. Garbage,"Metallica has been one of the best and most afluent bands of all time, But im sorry to say that this album is complete garbage. I am a huge metallica fan and it seriously disapoints me to hear how they could have succumbed to this. There are zero guitar solos, No melodies, Very little harmony and the final mixing is awful. The least they could do is make the instruments sound good. I can safely say this is worse than Load and Reload. and im afraid this will be the last metallica album."
1,What the heck happened to Kirk man.,"I BOUGHT THIS CD HOPEING IT WOULD REINSTILL MY FAITH THEY HADENT DRIED UP . FIRST THE DRUMS SOUND LIKE CRAP LIKE TIN CANS. THAN I WAITED AND WAITED AND WAS LIKE WHAT THE F### WHERE ARE THE SOLO'S NO GUITAR SOLO'S FROM THE MASTER HOW SLACK CAN YOU GET YES THIS IS MODERN BUT THAT IS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH TODAYS MUSIC NOBODY HAS TALLENT.KIRK MAN DONT KILL THE GUITAR LEGENDS OF THE WORLD IF EVERYONE STOPPED DOING SOLOS ALL THE HEROES BEFORE THEM WILL VANISH. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK I HAVE BEN A FAN SINCE LIGHTNING DAYS . MAYBE IT WAS CLIFF WHO HELD THEM TOGETHER, MAN WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED OUT THEY WERE AGIANST BANDS LIKE MOTLEY CRUE BUT DAMN IF THEY DIDNT BECOME THEM JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN MAINSTREAM RADIO."
1,Faint Anger Over This Release's Quality,"Saw ""Some Kind of Monster"" and thought it was fantastic, which led me to this album. I can honestly say I only like three of the tracks and I'm speaking forgivingly. What doesn't work on this release: the riffs often repeat over and over to no purpose, the lyrics seem rushed and ""crammed"" into place, virtually no distinct bass from Rob or guitar from Kirk, Lars drums sound like water dripping into a coffee can, Hetfield's voice gets squeaky at times, and the mixing/production is awful - I thought that something had gone terribly wrong with my system when I first played this disc. Sure, I'm disappointed with the music...but what is truly unforgiveable is the release of a disc that sounds like it has a layer of peanut butter on it! Metallica's fans at least deserve clear and professional sound. I won't tell you to love or hate the songs but I WILL tell you that you may have a hard time deciding while being so distracted by the awful sound quality."
1,really rather crap,"on a scale of genius to the opposite of genius, this collection of tunes is rather not great, and that is certainly not spectacular, in fact it is somewhere near crap-tacular. As for the DVD, I would not know, as I have not seen it (if only I could justify my review half as much, which if you have not noticed just consigned this CD to the nether-reigons of not very good, quite crap in fact."
2,A terrible departure for Metallica,"Ok, I've been a Metallica fan since I was a teenager (yes, I'm old now - in my early thirties). My wife bought me this new Metallica album as a gift because I still listen to their older stuff. But I have to tell you, St. Anger was a very unpleasant surprise.I don't dislike this album because I have a rigid vision of Metallica ""should be."" In fact, their music has evolved considerably over the years. I don't like this album because the songwriting is terrible, the vocals are awful (is James trying to sing?), and even Kirk's semi-shoddy guitar solos are missing.It would be a shame if future albums sounded anything like this one."
1,Kindergarten Snare Drum or What?,"Apparently on recording day Lars forgot his drum set and broke in to a local kindergarten to steal their wooden stool and tinny snare drum to use instead?Maybe someday I'll actually listen to the whole album and give it a better chance. For now, however, I can't get past the first track without laughing.Sorry guys, but compared to The Black Album and others this is like giving away a Harley to ride a tricycle.Honestly, I can't believe Metallica actually allowed this album to be released. You'd think Lars would have killed people in order to have stopped it. Ah well, try again boys, we'll forgive you.Seriously, though, Lars take the snare drum back to the kindergartners."
2,Very Disappointing Step Backwards,"Despite giving this album/CD another try after shelving it for a few years, I still agree with my original assessment that it is just not that good. I first listened to this CD on a long drive through Northern California. As I listened to it, with all the excitement that a new metallica offereing brings, I could not get over how uninspiring the music was. I still think that all of the songs sound the same, which unfortunately is not good, because they are each rather mundane. I guess this CD and its creation were musical therapy for Metallica, as depicted during Some Kind of Monster. It's too bad for us fans that we got brought along on the journey.Two stars for Metallica's worse album."
2,Baaaah!,"Okay, given some time to reflect on this CD has found me trying to avoid listening to it at all costs. The songs are too long, there are no solos, James Hetfield can't pull off the ""tough guy"" image, and that snare sound KILLS my eardrums. Stay away from this!"
5,"For fans of music, not fans of what other people say...","To the people who throw around the word ""sell-out"", you need to get a clue what a sell-out really is, you sell-out everyday wearing brand names and drinking Coke (Tool reference), then guys like Metallica who have given alot (more than you will ever dream of giving) to millions of people world-wide get flak because they want to do their own thing, and not what is expected of them? And they are the sell-outs?!?!? Buy a clue.As for the album, in my opinion, not their best, but still a great album, fave track is ""Unamed Feeling""."
3,New direction for Metallica.....,"When I first got the cd I listened to it for about a week. And came to the realization that although I've been listening to these guys since 86', I simply could not adjust to this cd. I liked the songs, I liked the garage sound that the cd had, but I just could not get past sound of the Lars' drumplaying. He didn't have the sound that was dominant in their previous records. I just couldn't dig it! But even though this cd has not been played since that first week, I still respect these guys tremendously. They decided to go in a direction that I'm not willling to go in. But they've been doing this since their first album. And that's whats kept me a fan of them for so long.But I think that their next release will fair a helluva lot better than this one. And I hope I don't have to wait another 6 years either."
1,Lame,"I love Metalica, but I don't know what happened with this one. It is so disjointed and just thrown together. No real thought behind the lyrics, no layering of the sound, no awesome guitar licks... It just sounds like they got togther for a weekend and thrashed this out - oh and let's film it and give away a DVD because nobody will buy it otherwise. I'm very dissapointed to say the least. If this is where they've come than I think they are done."
2,"Bob Rock, please retire !","I was really looking forward to this one, after I have read all Pre-Release Reviews and I couldn't wait any longer for the Release. I really thought and hoped that Metallica will return to making good music, but after inserting the disc in the player and listening to track number 1 I got dissapointed by them again. Who in Gods name does allow Mr. Bob Rock to produce records? He did an awful job, the sound of this Album is HORRIBLE, especially the drum sound is really bad. I wished Metallica would release a new Classic Album, but they only proved once again that they're gone. The only Highlight is Rob on the Bass. I saw their Concert from Rock am Ring, and he is a real great Bass player."
2,Metallica is dead! Long live Metallica!!,"It's ""Metallica"" written on the CD but where is Kirk? Cant hear his guitar! Where is James? Mumbling from the background! And what is so fantastic about the new snare-sound of Lars' drums? Sounds like the drum of a hindu monk...Dont like the CD although I'm a big fan for years. Go on boyz, you can do better!! Hope to see you on tour ... playing the old stuff!!"
3,I Love Metallica.....but tonight I'll cry myself to sleep.,"For years I have heard that Bob Rock is trying to find the ""live"" Metallica sound and put it on an album. After ""Justice"", who could blame them for going with a different producer. But consistently over the last three studio albums, Rock has continued to drift away from what made them so popular.Plain and Simple.....this album is OVERPRODUCED!No guitars or bass...ALL VOCALs and Drums. Vocals and drums are in ""front"" so much, that if you turn the volume down, all you hear are drums and vocals and a din in the background that must(and I'm guessing here) be the guitars and bass.The songs themselves are great and James is still sticking with his vocal stylings from Load and Reload..and I am fine with that.I just wish Flemming Rasmussen could have been give one song on this album ..for a little contrast."
2,This is not the Metallica I remember?,"I grew up listening to Metallica and this just isn't the Metallica I remember. This sounds like a totally different band. I really think they have been out of it for so long, they forgot how to play! If you're looking for a good old fashion metal CD, buy the new Black Label Society with Zak Wylde. Now there's a really [great] CD"
3,Note to buyer : Ignore the majority of these reviews.,"This is a 3 star album. Far from Metallica's best but not bad by any stretch of the imagination. I've never seen such blatant bashing for any cd, ever. Pathetic really."
1,Shoot me again - please!,"I was unnerved by the touring info, and it made me fear for this album. When I saw the coverart, I wasn't reassured, but I decided to listen with an open mind. Now that I've heard it for myself, I have to say this is possibly the WORST listening experience I've had in my life, and I couldn't even force myself more than halfway through some of the songs. Even if you like the newer Metallica, which I admittedly don't, this album is a travesty, and an insult to any fans who were indeed expecting a ""return"" to roots. Mindless repetitive music and talking lyrics and choruses (come on guys, memories so bad you can't remember more than a few lines repeated ad nauseum?), no edge, no solos, and all the appeal of a buzzing chainsaw. Way beyond a disappointment."
2,st. too much anger,"St. Anger is probably Metallica's better album since ""justice"" but not good enough. Production is not good, songs sound long and really streched, James has some serious singing issues to work out, why didn't Kirk play a solo? As far as Metallica standards go, this cannot stand up to it. As a fan since '88 I am dissapointed. It is heavy, aggressive, angry all of the above, but it just doesn't shine. Buy ""We've Come For You All"" by Anthrax or ""Viva Emptiness"" by Katatonia."
5,Load And Reload Never Happened,"The aliens who abducted the real James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammet back sometime in 1993 have returned them to the heavy metal world with an incredible low frequency alien life form named Rob Trujillo. I am watching the added DVD bonus as I am writing this review and all I can say is buy this freakin album because the legends are back they have brought a fresh metallic wave to both the ""mainstream"" and ""underground"" heavy metal scene. THEY ARE FREAKIN' BACK, BUY THIS FREAKIN' ALBUM"
3,Weird CD,"This is CD has a lot of energy and spunk found in previous albums such as Kill 'Em All and Garage Days Inc. There is very little ""Black Album"", ""Load"", and ""ReLoad"" style melody. These songs don't seem to have a set structure of a hard-rock song. They sound like free-style songs. They also don't have a feel of of a 2003 hard-rock/metal CD, but rather of one from the early 1980s.The seasoned Metallica listener will support Metallica by buying this CD but may not enjoy it as much as previous albums. Though, it is interesting to hear this new style of music.The average listener who is not very into Metallica will not understand the music and may have trouble enjoying is since there is little structure. If you want, buy it to support Metallica and/or hear new experimental rock. Otherwise, for enjoyment, this may not fulfill your expectations."
1,SAD BUT TRUE,"This album is just AWFUL. The production is just bad(even for a Bob Rock album). The drums sound like trash cans. There are NO guitar solos. The songs are long but their are no memerable riffs. It's like a wall of mush. And James has to revert to swearing because his lyrics are stupid and make no sense.Metallica are just trying to copy many nu metal bands like Korn, Limp wristed & Fear Factory. For a band that claims to do whatever they want. They sure have copying down to an art.Do yourself a favor and save your money for the new Maiden album coming out in September. You know they won't let us down."
4,A surprising -and very welcome- return,"Metallica has gained and lost fans in recent years because of their 'new ways' to deal with music. St. Anger is something very different... it is not a return to the Metallica of old, but it has nothing to do with the recent productions like Load and Re-Load: it is raw heavy metal, thought and played to make you bang your head. Pretty good, musically speaking. There is, however, the inevitable downside: very very few of the songs have good or at least interesting lyrics: too repetitive, to shallow and sometimes too disconnected. A sad downside, since most of us expect intelligent lyrics with strong music attached. The companion DVD is a smart move and a great addition to the CD. My final recommendation is: get it, it is a very nice CD and hopefully the start of a tendency for the band."
1,Come on!,This is a product of pure shameless greed. Metallica were once gods of mainstream heavy metal then they slowly spiraled downward. When they quit drinking and decided to make nu-metal they ruined it all. I'm not saying they should get back on the wagon but now that thier drug and alcahol free you would think they would have more than enough money. This is what happens when musicians get greedy. Perhaps it would be better to stick to underground music.
1,worst metallica album ever!!!,"i like every album metallica made from kill em all through and in cluding death magnetic except for one,..and that is s.t. anger!!as many other metallica fans here have stated this is easily metallica,s weakest album..from the awful drum sound to the half cooked state of most of the songs..except maybe some kind of monster, which would have benefitted from rick rubin,s production sound techniques used on the greatly improved follow up to this album,death magnetic.another thing lacking on this album is the absence of kirk hammet,s trademark guitar solos.as a metallica fan i,m glad they returned somewhat to form with death magnetic!! i would avoid saint anger unless you are a diehard collector that just must have every album this still great band has ever made!"
1,Complete & utter garbage!!!,"This band has hit a new low...Terrible mixing, production, writing, singing, drum sound (almost like Lars is playing on pots & pans)..etc, etc!I did'nt think they could get much worse than Load & Reload...but they have in a big way.....Yes...""It's sad but true""!!"
1,Don't buy it,This album is dreadful. I'm with with the USA fan who said he can't listen to a single track in its entirety. I'm not giving it the chance to grow on me - it's going back.Can this be the same band that did 'Wherever I may roam'? No wonder they had to give away a DVD with it.
1,Heavy Metal Is Bad News For Your Children,"MAVV studies have shown that children do whatever they hear on audo recordings such as Metallica Saint Anger which features bad material such as violence on the song Shoot Me Now, Cuss words every other violent chorus, anger against saints and the christian religioin, and santanic messages. This will make your kids chose the wrong path in life. Dont buy it for them. MAVV member Nancy"
3,Im madly in anger with You guys!,"Ok, Load bad, Re-load= nice try but still bad, Garage Inc.= enjoyed it, good job; S&M;= amazing!. Ok, now lets start with St. Anger, does'nt but it does'nt rocks. The Sound was not the best sound. James= needs to write better lyrics, his vocals are not 100% the same. Kirk= im still waiting for the solos dude!WTF!Robert= nice!, your bass skills rock! One Bad MuthaPlucka!Lars= nice drummings, very Thrashy! Songs i liked: 2- St. Anger3- Some Kind of Monster 8- Sweet Amber. Songs that are not good: 5- Invisible Kid 6-My World 10-Purify."
3,Hardcore Metallica-heads only,"Stop whining about how bad this stuff might be. Go back to your precious Black Album if this is too much for you. Think of St. Anger as a new Kill 'Em All.They're playing this stuff cuz they want to.The whole album sounds as if it's a 75 minute song. Metallica hit the record button and played all the songs straight through, without stopping. Thus, the only editing from the recording to the store shelf was to take out the tuning and changing of guitars.This is just a peek into the garage. It doesn't have to be pretty and it doesn't have to sound like the old stuff."
5,METALICCA'S BEST ALBUM EVER ! PURE GENIUS !,"This is by far the best CD Metallica have released to date. A collection of tracks reminiscent of their best. The song Frantic sounds like a mixture of &#65533;Ride the Lightning&#65533; and enter &#65533;Sandman&#65533;. Invisable Kid reminds me of their &#65533;Master of the Puppets&#65533; and &#65533;Justice for All&#65533; albums and &#65533;Shoot Me again&#65533;, is just like a mixture of &#65533;Whiplash&#65533; and &#65533;Creeping Death&#65533;. Go out and buy this album, it&#65533;s their best ever. The guitar solos are mind blowing also, Kirk seems to be playing a mixture of &#65533;Satrioni&#65533; and &#65533;Vinnie Moore&#65533; with thrash, (it&#65533;s a shame he doesn&#65533;t play like this on the other records) Lars drums are spot on and as for the vocals and bass, they are better than ever. So ignore all the cranky reviews and buy this ! You will not be disappointed !!!"
4,Purify This (Still F***in P***ed About the Lack of Solos),"Great work by the boys again: more aggressive than they've been in 12 years, no slow songs or mainstream bulls**t, how could you not love the title track ?!?! Heavy raw sound, reminds me a little of Kill Em All. Good deep growls from James from time to time (tho overall could have been harder and harsher like with Justice and the black albums).A bit disappointing at first was the stripped down, even simple sound: didn't seem like heavy metal, not a full sound. But that, we have gotten used to and even liking as mentioned above.(might need to get with the SanFran Symphony again)The worst part was NO GUITAR SOLOS ! I'm very disappointed and angry about this.LISTEN TO CHILDREN OF BODOM"
4,Return to Form,"Only four stars because the production is a little shotty but the tunes are dead on. After the Boys decided to muddle with commercial accessability throughout the 90's and release some lack luster albums they have come back with a fury. Not the same old Metallica, this time out they decide to take the thrash/ punk approach from some of their influences of yester year. This is a metal album through and through so some may not like its harsh approach but it is what die hard, old school Metallica fans have been waiting for for a long time..."
4,Metallica St.Anger with free bonus DVD!,"I got this cd last night right when it came out at midnight,am I crazy or what! My only complaint is that the drum sound is horrible,the drum sound on these songs on the DVD are much better quality!.This is the album that should have come out after the Black album,there are no radio friendly songs on here,except maybe the title track.I didn't really like Invisible kid that much,it's not too bad though,you can tell they are influenced by Motorhead,Fear Factory,and I do know that Kirk likes Mushuggah!Hetfield's lyrics are superb,some real personal issues here especially since he spent some time in rehab.If you want speedy metal riffs,excellent singing and innovative non new metal rock get this freaking cd now you won't be disappointed,it's not puppets or ride the lightning,but it's definitely not Load or Reload,Metallica baby!"
1,St. Piece of muddy tin can ...,"Bob Rock needs to change the batteries in his hearing aids, because this thing is the worst produced, worst sounding cd ever recorded, not to mention-by a band of such incredible talent and musicianship. I love Metallica. I hate St. Anger. I am considering legal action for trama and emotional stress received during the listening of this disc. Honesty, who could sit through that? How did the band let this thing go out the door, and at what point were they all sitting around the studio listening back and all go ""Yeah, this rocks"". They should be ashmed, I was really looking forward to this record, but now I feel ripped for spending the ...."
2,"Good in spots, but fairly disappointing","I bought this album thinking that it was going to be a great classic I would be listening to for ages, but I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, I am glad that Metallica is trying new things, but they do not interest my taste in music. One of the most disappointing aspects is from a lyrical standpoint. I dislike very much the repitition of the same lyrics, even when they are not the chorus. When the guitars are played fast, they are played well, but sound too low and distant. The double bass drums are the best part of this album. It is some of the fastest I have heard yet. The rest of the smaller drumset now is annoying. It sounds like Lars is hitting an empty barrel. If it had a different sound, it would be a whole lot better. This album could have been great if a couple of sounds had been altered and the lyrics were better. From now on, I am borrowing the new Metallica CD before I spend my money on one."
1,what is this,ok ok i really do not like metallica any way but by far this is the worst thing i have ever heard from them it really really frightens me when james tries to sing. St anger is the best cd in my collection to play frisbee with because i like the design on it when i see it spinnin through the air. I suggest anything to this even yanni
4,Metallica rocks,"I am a big time Metallica fan, I love just about all their songs and I must say that this is a pretty new experience for me, don't get me wrong this album rocks from start to finish but it is just very different, although it is nice to see the boys going back to the old days with long and heavy songs. Lots of angry lyrics from James, Lars is pounding the drum like no tomorrow, Kirk is not very noticiable in this album but still good, and Rob is actually pretty good, if you like the 90s Metallica you may not find this interesting to you but if 80s Metallica is your flavor you will enjoy this, as for the hardcores like myself, just get it, is a Metallica album. the boys rocks on!"
1,What the hell is this.,What the hell is this this isnt metallica any more. They dont even have the same guitar distortion or the same snare drum. I think this is crap this is the worst cd i ever bought. After this cd i think metallica ruined them self they should just give it up and pack their stuff.
3,Where's Kirk?,"First let me say that I have been a Metallicist since they first hit the scene and have the utmost respect for the band and the decisions they make for the future of their sound. That being said, this album was very disappointing. The guitar riff's and bass lines are awesome. Lars is a great drummer but it almost seems as if the whole album concentrated on him and James' parts. There are no Kirk Hammet solos to tear your heart out or give you an adrenaline rush like the Metallica of yester year. I'm not one of those fans who try to put them in a little box or anything but their style on this album really annoys the hell out of me. On the plus side, they put together some really [nice] riffs and crunch sections. The most disappointing thing about it was the seeming lack of creativity in the lyric arrangements. Buy it if you must (I did), but be prepared for a huge change in direction."
2,fast drums and lackluster vocals,"st. anger left much to be desired. lars is way to fast throughout the album (punk thrash) and james's vocals made no sense. if lars slowed down a bit ala 4/4 and james spent more than a day writing..... it could have...... this reaks of mid-life crises. and where was kurt?. overall a muddy mix. however, the downloads at metallicavault.com more than made up for the price i paid for this monstrosity of marketing. you missed guys"
1,Nu-Metallica Is No-Good,"One the positive side, there are some good guitar riffs here and there. On the negative, the drums are very thin and harsh, the vocals sound very strained, the guitars rarely leave the low frets, and there's not really a standout song on the entire album.With Load/Re-Load, we knew Metallica was experimenting with softer rock music. It wasn't nearly as heavy, but it was still essentially Metallica. Now Metallica seems to be chasing trends to the point of completely losing their identity. The tuned-down baritone guitars, endless riff-recycling, whiney lyrics, and no solos make for a very mundane listening experience."
1,What happened Metallica?,"I used to love your music, now you come up with a CD that sounds like it was recorded in somebody's garage, album cover art that looks like classroom daydreaming cartoons drawn by a 12 year old, and just plain boring songs. This is the worst metal crisis I've been in since Rob Halford from Judas Priest decided to become openly gay and put out gothic music. I'm gonna send you a get well card once you are over this sickness and start releasing metal albums again."
2,Complete disappointment,"Out of all the cds hitting the stores this year, this was one I was really waiting for! I just couldn't wait for it to come out! I wanted to hear some of their new groovy guitar riffs that these boyz are noted for i.e (every Metallica cd b4 this one). But it just didn't happen. I can maybe stand about 2 songs on this cd. Most of the songs sound like pots and pans being banged together. ITZ ...! I'm a big fan of a lot of the new metal and classic metal, but this isn't for me. Guitars are sloppy, vocals are horrible, drums are annoying with the ""ringing"" sound, and no leads. Big disappointment for me..."
2,Its Over...,"You've got to be kidding...this cd..is..well..horrible. The lyrics are god awful and the drumming is..weak...thought Lars' drumming has always been overrated. Theres no killer riffs in this cd at all. The way James sings here..is..not very good at all. I dont know what the hell happened to these guys..but ever since the ""Black Album"" came out..its been a sharp downhill decline from there. This cd will sell millions based on them..being Metallica. But trust me..this cd is not worth spending a dime on. If you really want this cd..download it..and even that will be a waste of your time. Dont listen to these ""metallica fanatics"" who dont wanna admit that this cd blows."
1,"If this was a new band, I still wouldn't like it","There's a lot I could say about this release, but I think I'll just keep it simple. The band should change their name; this is not Metallica. This is Metallica with an identity crisis.I don't expect nor do I want the band to revert to the Kill 'em All/Lightning/Puppets/Justice era material, but this new batch of songs is simply not acceptable. However, it does beat the hell out of Reload (but then again, what doesn't?). I find it hard to believe that I'm only the 4th individual to review this release, and that the other 3 reviews are all positive. Where are the other (MISSING)reviews? In any case, Metallica's latest failure is not worth the effort of putting into words how abysmal it is. If you have yet to give up on Metallica, now's the time to do so. They gave up on you long ago."
3,OK,"I forgot to add something to my earlier 3-star review, which was published a few days ago. I've noticed that a lot of reviews for this album end with ""Cliff Burton must be rolling over in his grave"". Obviously, they've forgotten that before Cliff died, he was a member of Metallica, member meaning he shared his views on the direction of the band (hint hint-direction changed from AJFL to the Black Album). His opinion might have been the same as the other 3 members. He might have wanted to shift types of sound too. SO do not say he is rolling over in his grave. He probably would have like the changes as much as the other 3 members do."
3,au moin cest meilleur que load et reload,"pas comparable a master,justice,lighting ou kill em all le son aurait pu etre meilleur dans le genre a lalbum noir.ils ont asseiller de revenir comme dans le bon vieux temps mais sans succes a part peut etre st anger qui en vaut la peine bravo pour le dvd qui vient avec au moins ya ca. st anger pour les fans seulement. le prochain master 2 peut etre !!!!"
1,"fais honneur au thrash metal, achete pas cette merde","si tu veux acheter un album de metallica ou si tu veux connaitre ce groupe n,achète pas cette merde ca va te décourager, ce que tu dois acheter ce sont les vieux albums, les meilleurs cd de metallica sont kill'em all ;ride the lightning;master of puppets;and justice for all et black album.leurs cd live cé vraiment le meilleur qu tu peu avoir mé ils sont chers."
