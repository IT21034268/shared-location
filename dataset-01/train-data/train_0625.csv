3,It's Raining Men,"Bought it for ""It's Raining Men""....because I just love it! The other's on the album are great too... but not like IRM, which I got hooked on after hearing it in the movie ""Bridget Jones Diary""."
1,A Wonderful CD.,A Wondeful CD.The Weather Girls' CD is absolutely brilliant. The music is beautifully melodeous and the words to the songs are extremely profound. Everything with this brilliant American group has sung is first class and I recommend this particular CD to evryone. It is absolutely fabulous.
3,Our toddler likes these dirty dogs,"The dogs are ""dirty"" and temporarily clean up when rubbed with a small washcloth. Our toddler likes them."
2,"Cute in theory, but doesn't work as advertised","Like previous reviewer says, the dirt spots fade in water but don't come close to disappearing completely. They just go from dark brown to light brown. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Doesn't work as advertised,"Seeing the previous reviews, I wonder if the quality went down. I just got mine and they don't work as advertised. The spots disappear in warm water about 70%. They do not leave ""clean"" dogs behind. I am not impressed at all. They are cute and are somewhat entertaining to my son, so that is why it has two stars and not one."
1,Lying to children. At least in our case.,"My six year old daughter asked for these for Christmas. We put them in the tub, and the spots turned a slightly less dark brown. That's all. They looked as dirty as ever, just with a lighter color of dirt. I tried various temperatures of water (cold to scalding), and various times, but the best we ever saw was maybe a 50% (being generous) reduction in darkness of the spots. I wonder if that's what everyone is getting and some people are just satisfied with that, or if we got a bad batch, or the quality has gone down? Whatever the case, the gap between reality of the toy we got and the picture on the package of a sparkling ""clean"" dog is so large that I can only characterize it as lying to children. Shame on them."
2,Disappointed that dogs don't get clean,"These dogs are really cute and my 5-year old had been eyeing them for awhile. But, when I finally caved and bought them a few weeks ago, imagine my surprise to learn that the dogs DON'T get clean. They each have brown ""mud"" spots on their bodies that when exposed to warm/hot water and supposed to wash away. They fade for sure ... but don't disappear like the pictures indicate. My son was sooooo frustrated that no amount of scrubbing, or prolonged soaking would get the doggies clean.He does still play with them as squirters in the tub, so it's not a total loss, but buyer-beware ... the dogs DON'T get clean!"
1,Doesn't work and Not Worth the Price,My 5 year old daughter was so excited when the dogs arrived in the mail that she begged me to take a bath so she could try them out. She was so disappointed and kept asking why the spots were not fading. The other reviews are correct; they are nice squirt toys but definitely not worth the $$$.
4,this sounds ridiculous,"My these are my daughter's favorite toys. She has played with them daily for well over a year. Her grandmother got them for her - what a silly little toy, but she (age 2) squealed with delight when opening them, and has dutifully bathed them each day. She's since progressed to giving them ""puppy drinks"" and other imaginative play."
3,Comic book,I did not know it was a comic book format. My fault! Was expecting a paperback book like Eckert's others.
4,Bluejacket: War Chief of the Shawnees,"I am not a direct descendant, but I can assure the readers that the story as told by Mr. Eckert is authentic. My maternal grandfather's sister was married to William Bluejacket."
4,"Excellently written book, but is it the truth...","Typically, Eckert's writing style makes this a book that is hard to put down. It is very exciting reading. It is not one of the best books that Eckert has written however. Also, it is shorter and doesn't have the great deal of detail that he put into his ""Tecumseh"" book, for example. It is a lively story, but now that I have read other reviews, I wonder if it is based on error. The early part of the story concerns the fact that Blue Jacket is a ""captured"" white boy who becomes a great Indian War Chief. If that is not true, then this part of the book is in error. The history of Blue Jacket as an Indian is well written and exciting, in any case. No matter his origin, Blue Jacket was a great Indian warrior and leader.From other things I have read, my guess would be that Eckert's version is correct. In any case, this is an exciting and enjoyable book to read."
3,Uniqua costume,Very cute costume. My daughter LOVES all things Backyardigans. It's too big for my daughter to use this year so I will have to save it for next year.
3,"teacher, longtime softball player dissapointed with this softball bat","I wanted to ""treat"" myself to a good bat and I purchased this 34inch 30oz Easton. I've purchased various easton bats over the years and was looking forward to this one. I'm 6'1"" and a lean 195 lbs and expect a bat to transfer energy, not flex too much. The bat sounds odd, as if it literally had a barrel made from bamboo. I know, it's weird. People ask about the bat all the time, for all the wrong reasons. The extended barrel might be the culprit, but who knows. Don't get me wrong, it does have positives. When you hit the ball perfectly, it does push the ball deep, but I use this as my secondary bat. Now, I'm back to my older Eastons that perform solid and have softballs pop right off the barrel. Hope this helps. -E."
5,ACAPPELLA MUSIC IS DEFINITLY IN!!!,"Since the day I was introduced to the music of Acappella, I was hooked. I think that they have extraordinary vocal talents and their music comes in handy when I need a little spiritual upliftment. They have definitly proven that ""We don't need no music"" when it comes to praising the Lord. Keep on praisin' Chruch of Christ style Acappella!!!"
3,Expectations,"Not as good as their other albums, but still okay. Need another praise and worship album with a little bit more soul to it."
1,"European Windows (John Lewis, MJQ)","My husband and I, he a jazz and blues fan, and I, loving jazz and classical guitar, especially, found this album unexciting. It was surprizing, as I heard it in the 1960's and remember loving it. But it seemed kind of pedantic, like background music, rather than captivating."
5,A Future Classic Vocalist,"Shawnn Monterio's Visit Me is the most listenable CD I've heard in a long time. He slow, smoldering style works equally well with serious tracks and lighter Playful ones. Every song commands attention and shows her talent like facets of a well-polished gem. She has a classic style, never intrusive, never somber. It's definitely worth a listen. I highly recommend it. You'll thank me later."
5,Review taken from ESRS Newsletter,"The impressive, comprehensive volume is.....a very useful book on all aspects of sleep and its disorders: it is up-to-date, suitably large to serve well as a handbook, and the comprehensive bibliographies form a link to the vast available literature in the field. The book is a valuable encyclopedia for readers involved in sleep medicine or interested in sleep disorders. All chapters feature an extensive bibliography, which makes it useful for those wishing to delve into the literature. At the end one finds the most important questionnaires in use for evaluating insomnia, hypersomnia, and disorders of circadian rhythm. The glossary of terms is most useful. Review by Dag Stenberg, University of Helsinki"
5,If you like romantic movies this is a great flick,"This was selected because of Amazon ""other customers purchased this"". I just fell in love with the movie. Great comedy and locations. Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr were on their game. Great chick flick."
5,magical romance,"This movie inspired me to backpack through Italy. It isn't a ""travel"" movie, but certainly gives wonderful glimpses of a beautiful country."
5,Great Movie,"My mom is always looking to get rid of her old vhs tapes and have the dvd's of her movies because she watches them so much, and I'm always glad to get her presents I know she'll like. This is one of them. ^w^"
3,Cute film,"This definitely isn't motion picture at its best. However, Marisa Tomei always turns in a lovable, humorous performance, as she does here. She's locked in a fun female bonding trip, one that makes her companion's husband realize he's been neglecting his wife, while at the same time allowing Ms. Tomei to romp around Italy engaging in adventures while she looks for her soulmate.I did feel a bit betrayed as the film resolved the ""soulmate"" issue, which I won't give away here. All in all, it's worth seeing once, just for fun."
2,Award winner,"This is, hand down, the worst chick flick ever made. Tomei is the perennial 14-year-old, talking with her hands, giggling, bawling, in constant movement and near hysteria. Downey is perhaps the worst leading man in recent memory; he's the Robert Lowry or James Ellison of our time. The story is simply ridiculous and utterly unbelievable. Still, one can imagine teeny girls in theaters all over the world weeping into their popcorn.In short, this is a first class turkey. Only the lovely photography saves it from utter infamy."
5,SO ROMANTIC!!!,"This movie has not received the attention it deserves! This is a story has it all: good friends, sweet romance, hilarious scenarios, and most importantly, self-discovery. The scenery is stunning, the costumes are gorgeous, and the beautiful Italian operatic music is enthralling. All the characters are funny and endearing, insights are given that make the viewer come to like and understand each player. Faith almost settles for the wrong man, but mounting pre-wedding jitters and a trick played on her as a girl propel her into the adventure of a lifetime. Her sister-in-law comes along for the ride, both to keep Faith out of trouble and to iron out her own feelings about her troubled marriage. Spontaneity pays off in the long run for both women as they learn about love and life. Robert Downey, Jr. plays a convincing, funny, charming, heart-warming hero willing to do anything to get (and keep) the girl! Warning: you'll want to travel to Italy after viewing this film!"
4,Nice Romantic Movie,"This is a somewhat unknown movie but it has a very different twist. It is light, the scenes in Italy are great and it is pure entertainment!"
5,top drawer,item was as described and shipped in a quick fashion. I would deal with this person in the future. Topdrawer company
3,Love is blind.,A far-fetch romantic comedy. Funny and charming. The acting is wonderful and believable.
5,Wonderfully Sappy,"Only You - Well recommended '94 romcom and a stunning photographic tour of Venice and Rome make this worth the trip. Quirky romantic and a step further in the legendary Robert Downey Jr.'s portfolio; very Cary. Marisa Tomei is goddess beautiful and the story keeps your interest. The backups are particularly charming here and give the story some depth of character. For women and art lovers, the shoe angle will be appealing, and the music will tear you with strings. Wonderfully sappy."
2,disappointing and corny,"I was truly disappointed by this movie. I rented it because I mistakenly thought that this was the movie that Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for as Best Actress. After watching it all the way through, I suddenly realized that it was My Cousin Vinny that she won for. Now, I'm as romantic as the next person, but this movie was so sappy that it was unrealistic and stupid. Marisa Tomei's performance in this movie and her performance in My Cousin Vinny are like black and white. In Only You, she takes off on a whim to chase after some guy named Damon Bradley, only 10 days before her wedding. Romantic? Sure! But the way she plays it out is ridiculous. Call me a cynic, but she makes herself way too vulnerable to the men she encounters in Italy. I'm glad I saw My Cousin Vinny first because, after her performance in Only You, it would take a lot for me to see her in any other movie."
1,Worst romantic comedy EVER MADE,"I am astounded by the number of 5 star reviews for this movie. It has got to be one of the sappiest, most poorly scripted, and ridiculous movies ever. I like Marisa Tomei, Bonnie Hunt, and Robert Downey Jr. But this movie was an epic fail. Marisa Tomei's character was a total flake, the type that gives women everywhere a bad name. Do not buy this movie. You should only watch it if it's free, like if you find it in a dumpster or something. Even then, that should give you a clue about the quality of this film."
5,The Best!,"I decided to rent this movie knowing nothing about it. I loved it sooo much I watched it 5 days in a row. It's even my boyfriends favorite movie now. If you liked Return To Me, You've Got Mail or Runaway Bride you will fall in love with this one. It is funny and romantic. A five star movie for anyone!"
3,Gorgeous Italy - Sweet movie,"Again I must wonder how the reviewers make use of the 1 to 5 scale in terms of Stars... Little sweet movies like this should never qualify for either 1 or 5 and in my mind this one did not either.Personally I find Tomei highly underrated as an actress and she is brilliant and gorgeous in this movie and in general the actors carry the movie, as does the amazing landscapes and communities in Italy depicted herein. The story line is predictable yet sweet, feel good and yet forgettable... nothing wrong with that however if your expectations are not for a cinematic master piece (deserving of 4 or 5 stars) then why rate it 1 for disappointment?So all in all a highly recommended movie scoring my top score for a sweet little feel good romantic comedy."
5,Romance at its best...,"The film, ""Only you"" is delightful. Marisa Tomei plays Faith, a highly romantic girl that believes in destiny. As a young girl she played games that told her the name of the person she would fall in love with and marry, later confirmed by a fortune teller, and she sets out to make it come true.The filming takes place in the USA and Italy, and if you have ever visited Venice and Rome, you will love to revisit these spectacular places. As her wonderful sister-in-law, Bonnie Hunt delivers a rather wonderful performance as the married woman who because she believes her husband is having an affair, travels to Europe to redefine her purpose.Robert Downey Jr. is magnificently romantic. If you are not careful, after watching this movie you may simply purchase a ticket and go to Italy in search for romance. Don't miss it!"
3,Mixed feelings,"Cathy Carr's music is nearly impossible to get on CD. This disc, from the EEC, brings 32 cuts to her fans and is most welcome. The Roulette material and Laurie cuts are fine, but the Fraternity sides are nearly unlistenable. The old records are much better, and how often can you say that these days. She was certainly a sensational ballad singer who perfectly captured the spirit of teenage music of the late 50's and early 60's, much the same way Connie Francis did. I'm happy I've got one but only about two-thirds of it is going on the ipod."
3,Probly 4 or 5 stars,I got a demo of this cd. 8 songs. 1 full one and 7 that are like 1 min 15 sec. Now I have to find this somewhere cause I gotta hear the rest of the songs. I suggest u do the same.
4,Everything likes a waddler,"When a manmade fire sweeps through the Australian bush, birds and animals panic. Kangaroos flee. Koalas cling stupidly to trees. Dingoes turn and race towards the flames. We find ourselves rooting for a humble wombat as he tries desperately to reach the safety of a lake, waddling as fast as he can manage on ""short, stubbed legs"" as the racing fire bears down. The Death of a Wombat is a simple, imaginative and unusual little story. It's also strangely touching. As the author says, ""Everything likes a waddler."""
4,Someone Was Watching,I like this book. It's a real good mystery book. There is some action in the book at the end. Pat is my favorite character.He likes football. Chris is the main character. His sister disappears. They go out to find her. It is a really good book. You might like it.
5,sad but interesting,This book is about aboy who is searching for his little sister who is supposedly dead and drown.
5,A Wonderful Book,"I read this book when I was in the third grade, and, although I am now outside of the recomended age group, I still continue to read it. It is just a wonderful, gripping story that tells the love that exists between siblings. It was a great mystery and the heart was not lost on me. :oP Every young kid should read it!"
4,A BREATH TAKING BOOK,"The book captures your imagination and keeps you off your seat. When you read it you can't put it down. The story is about Chris and his friend Pat. They are determined to find Chris's little sister Molly who disappeared and police said she drowned. Now three months later a video tape was made the day that Molly was lost and Chris found that someone was there at the scene of the crime. Pat and Chris go to Greenwater (the town Molly was kidnapped in) and find out that the suspects moved. Chris and Pat use knowledge,skill,and courage to get Molly back. When they get so close to grabbing Molly and leaving the criminals the girl isn't Molly. Or is she? The book is about two friends using courage to get back the person they love. Will Pat and Chris get Molly back? Read the book."
4,How Far Will He Go?,"The story was great!!! It was about a boy who went up to his summer house with his family. On their way they stop at the Cloverbud. When they get to their house they settle down and go down to the park by the river. They feed the ducks and play in the water.After that they get out and Molly colors in her coloring book and Chris gives his parents a hand sign that he is going to film the ducks. So he goes and films them and goes back to their picnic spot.He gets and cant find molly's they search for 2 days strait. then they say ""Missing, Presumed Drowned"". They go back home. 3 months later they come back to the house. So they fix her up a bit. stay awhile and then go home.Chris calls his friend Pat and he comes over. They eat dinner and then decide to watch the video they made that day. Nothing seems wrong the first time he watches it the second time he figures out an awful secret. Just how far will he go to see if he can find Molly."
2,voyage,"I was a little dissapointed. The best two albums produced by this group, I thought, were on this CD judging by the picture on the front. Turns out it was a selection from both albums. I would have much rather had both albums complete."
1,Very disappointed!,"These CD's were ok if you don't care who recorded them. I seemed to have been under the ""delusional impression"" that the music would be by the original artists. Not so! The songs are just not the same without this!!"
4,true to sufism,"This is the first book I have read by this enlightened author, and I was impressed by his understanding of the esoteric teachings of the basis of Islamic Sufism. This is a great introduction to sufi teachings and those who enjoy the instrospections introduced in the Song of the Bird would marvel at Sufi parables and the works of Rumi. Truth has no boundaries and organized religion essentially helps members of a given society work towards a common goal - that of self discovery and the meaning of existence. As Rumi put it - there are many ways to kneel and kiss the ground (ie pray). It is the motive not the motion that counts at the end of the day."
5,The Song of The Bird,"I have read this book over and over since 1985 and have given it as a gift many times as I continue to appreciate the wisdom and beauty of the meditations and wish to share them with friends,"
3,Dated Bible Study,"Jill Briscoe is always awesome, but this is a definitely dated bible study. Also, I will probably not end up using it, because the class work is on a different woman than the leader teaches on at the beginning of the class. Still a good study if you want to review women of the bible."
4,to see the sea,"one feels the desert's choke.....the town's hope, yet the sea does not deliver. a good easy read..if you put it down and pick it back up....latter...you will not miss a beat."
2,Forced ...,I cannot figure out why this book was on the shortlist for the 2004 Whitbread First Novel Award. The use of big words and teacher pleaser descriptions was forced and did not come across as natural. The characters were not well developed. I felt the author was either making an attempt at existential thought or else just couldn't come up with much of a plot. Every mention of a Greek mythological story or person was referenced in footnotes regardless of common knowledge (for many readers) of the most famous ones. How many times can an author use the word clandestine without the word loosing its charm?
1,This CD Is Horrible,"I like Living Legends but this album deserves to be thrown into the void, its annoying and boring. The production is lame and the lyrics just fell off on this one."
3,This should have been released April 1st not the 6th,"At least then i could have some hope that this album was an April Fool's joke. The first 30 seconds of the album pretty much set the tone by leaving you wondering with the f*** is goin on? The first track had me laughing, but then when i hit track 2, thats when I got worried...""Fill my drink up"" FILL MY DRINK UP??? Did the Legends seriously do this?!!? Some of the beats on this album are just plain wack.There are some decent tracks, however, including their single ""Damn it feels good"" and ""hold your own"".I admit I had incredibly high expectations for this release and maybe as I listen to this album more, it will grow on me. I hope it will."
2,What Happened?,"I'm a huge Living Legends fan, but this CD is by far their worst. Most of the tracks only have 2 or 3 of the MC's on 'em, and every member has a solo track. This sounds more like a compilation not a group album. And most of the beats sound horrible, not up to LL standards at all. There is, however, one good thing about this album, The bonus disc! I don't know if it's a limited edition thing or not but the bonus disc had a bunch of classic LL joints like ""Simple Man"" & ""24 hrs w/ a G"". If you want to here a good Legends album go pick upAlmost FamousorClassic, stay away from this one."
2,I guess it's called Creative Differences for a reason.,"Not really what I was expecting. With tracks like Fill My Drink Up, Time To Ride, and Friends Are Calling, you'd think Outkast and Mac Dre got together and had a baby. It would get one star if it weren't for Get It In Your Soul."
5,Great book for learning,"This is a superb textbook and it's easy to see why the book is in its ninth edition. What I really enjoyed (yes, I know this may sound a little incongruous in relation to calculus) was the step-by-step build-up of knowledge with good, clear examples. Also, for the problems at the end of each section, all the odd problems have solutions, so one can get some practice (something that is unfortunately rare for many textbooks).Before going through this book, I had minimal exposure to calculus and what I had seen wasn't very favorable. This book was a key reason why I now really enjoy the subject and feel very comfortable in this area."
2,Book is terrible,I felt like this book does not give good descriptive examples to help you throughout the problems.
2,Not Comprehensive,"Unless you already know most of Calculus and are just using this book as a refresher, which is doubtful, this book is not the most comprehesive. Because the first chapter is a ""refresher"" on pre-calculus work (mostly trigonometry) it doesn't take the time to explain any of the material. It appears this book focuses more on the trig portion of calculus than the algebraic components."
4,"Not rigor, not dumbed down.","I seen my roomates with this book and thought its just another one of those nonrigor books but its not so bad and problems are half bad and sometimes amusing. But... if you endeavor into rigor, eventually everyone who pursues this sense of madness has to, then perhap like said before Apostol or Spivok might suit you... Good book, not bad, look for used ones... I got mine for $4!"
1,Terrible,"Do not buy this book. It's examples are terrible. I've already taken calculus in high school, but I forgot a lot of the material. This book is not refreshing my memory very well."
3,The limit is 0,"I don't know lim(integration(sin(1/(1+t))dt) from t=0 to t=x as x->infinity. I suspect it's infinity. Anyway, if it converges the problem is trivial since lim(C/x)=0 as x->infinity. Suppose integral diverges, let F(x)= integral(sin(1/1+t) from t=0 to t=x and by the fundametal theorem of calculus F'(x)= sin(1/1+x) and so lim F'(x)=0 as x->infinity. Now by L'Hospital's rule the limit in question is equal to lim F'(x)/1 (since the derivative of x is 1)as x goes to infinity which is equal to 0."
2,Not recommended for students (high school or beyond),"This book is the third calculus book I've used since I first took a calculus course in high school, and it's hands down the worst I've seen. The examples in the book are aimed more towards the challenge problems in the back of each section. If you're having problems with Problem #1 in a particular section, don't expect this book to tell you how to do it. I suppose the writers assume that the reader already has a great understanding of what's going on."
2,Fell apart on the 1st day...,My kids (two toddlers) thought this was pretty cool when we got it...but had pulled out the fibers within an hour. I wouldn't recommend it for small kids...it'd probably be fine if you have older kids who can restrain themselves from pulling on the fibers!
2,"Item is nice, but the photo is really misleading.","This is for the fitted sheet, which is the bottom item of the photo. The nice floral pattern on the silk finsh does NOT exist. Even the color, if you look closely, it's not the ivory color of the top 3 items, it's a more pinkish color.I admit, the color is written in the description and I didn't read it carefully enough. But that photo is just bad. Even has a 2nd photo showing the nice floral pattern on the sheet, making me believe that does exist. It may be hard to get an attractive picture on just the fitten sheet, but this photo has to be changed to be more clear of the item that is being sold.Don't mind paying $300 just for the fitten sheets, but at this price, it not only need to be comfortable, it needs to look nice as well. unfortunately without the floral patterns and the pink color, it feels and looks like just like a $50 set of 1200 thread sheets."
2,Disappointing,"I teach Gilgamesh every year in my Freshman Honors Seminar, and it has always been one of my and my students' favorite texts. That is, until the anthology I was using put out a new edition and switched from David Ferry's to Jackson's translation. I found that Jackson managed to obscure (or just ignore) most of the important themes of the work. He gives his reader no sense of the bond between Gilgamesh and Enkidu; his account of Enkidu ""becoming human"" through his interactions w/ the temple harlot focuses almost completely on sex, with no hint of Enkidu's growing self-consciousness. Next year I'm bagging the anthology and going w/ a self-contained copy of Ferry."
5,The Epic of Gilgamesh by Danny P. Jackson,"I just wanted to take the time and give proper acknowldgement for this wonderful rendition. This past year I have had the opportunity to study mythology under the direction of Mr. Jackson, and he furthermore discussed this literary work into a living, breathing organism. The easily comprehensibile text paired with the beautiful artistry and reproductions of ancient Sumer have created a delightful reading environment. It is throught the interventions of art and mythology that people can begin to see a distinction of time and place. Mr. Jackson has accomplished this in his beautifully translated literary epic! Thanks for a great read!!"
3,First-ever written fiction proves to be interesting!,"When I found that this work dated back further than 2000BC, I though, ""This is going to be awful!"" But because it has been translated into English, the story is clear (or clearer than the original version on clay tablets) and has you wondering what is going to happen next. Excellent story!"
3,"Older model, but a really nice case.","This is a really nice small computer case. Even though it's quite small, it still accepts full size PCI cards, instead of those harder to find half height PCI cards. The case also has a really bright blue LED that makes the case stand out a bit. The case also has two rear fans that keep the system cool.The power supply however included with this model is only rated at 200 watts, and is pretty weak. It could barely power my system which only consists of a Pentium D 805 processor, a fanless nVidia graphics card, and a 200gb SATA hard drive (no optical drives). Athenatech has released a replacement model that features a power supply with 275 watts. I was able to obtain such model (exact same case, just better power supply) and have been happy ever since."
2,A boring book on marilyn,"Sorry, but I found this book written by an author who used other books written about Marilyn by other authors and ""her opinions"" on those. If you are confused by that statement, try reading this boring rehashed book of other books on poor Marilyn. Don't bother and waste your money. No lie.......ugh!"
1,I'll be sure to read all those other Marilyn biographies...,"This book is awful, all she does is rehash what others have said. She is preoccupied with name dropping other (better) Marilyn biographers and it becomes obvious that you are better off reading their versions. Overall, muddled and nearly unreadable. I find it laughable that she is a literature professor- it reads just like a dry and unimaginative thesis."
3,too academic,"I am not saying that this book is bad. In fact, it is well written with interesting insights. But I think it shouldn't be advertised as a biography, because, in my opinion, it is more a thesis (like the ones they do at universities). Now, I am well educated; the problem is not that I could not understand the book, the problem is that I was looking for a more detailed description of the person who MM was, not the ideas about the ideas of who she was.This is what this book is really about: the opinion about the different versions of who she was. Unfortunately, real details of what made this woman interesting are very scarce throughout the book.If you are someone that enjoys the dissection of other books or theories, then this book is for you. If you are looking for a classic biography, then maybe you should look for another one."
5,Put this in your bag of tricks.,"This module is advertised as the intro to a series of modules that are pure dungeon crawl (Long on Hack 'n Slash and Traps, short on roleplaying), but each of the levels in this dungeon can easily be adapted by a DM to be a standalone adventure. As such, this module will work for DMs who want a long running dungeon crawl, or DMs who just want a bunch (up to 5) of drop in 1 night adventures. Anyone looking to make money at publishing modules should look at this as a good example. This presumes next to nothing about the campaign, and so you can fit it where you need it in your campaign rather than making your campaign fit the module."
3,"More of the original score, please","I liked the movie and I like the songs on the soundtrack, but I loved the original score by Carter Burwell and am very disappointed not to have more more of that on the soundtrack. I have the other tracks on other CDs but bought this solely for about the 5-6 minutes of original score. Mrs. Ruskin"
3,One-track treasure?,"One track - Tony Bennet's slick version of the Irving Berlin classic, NOW IT CAN BE TOLD - made this CD worth the price ...for me, at least. And hey, you get Sinatra too? Haven't you ever bought a CD for the sake of one single track before? I have...hundreds of times."
3,One track makes it worthwhile,"Tone Bennett's wonderful rendition of the old Irving Berlin classic, NOW IT CAN BE TOLD, made this CD worth the price. And hey, you have Sinatra too! (Don't you sometimes buy a CD for the sake of one track?"
1,too long; not appropriate for any age,"I just received this and I'm confused by the positive reviews. I think the book was a good idea, but the authors needed a merciless editor. The book is WAY too long: 20 pages with 80 words on some pages, practically a term paper, a painful one. The book is recommended for ages 4-8, but the drawings and language are more suited for 3-5 year olds; in fact I found the language down right condescending (babyish). There's a weird lack of cohesion about the whole book, like the authors hadn't quite figured out what they wanted to say or who they wanted to say it to. This book isn't appropriate for anyone."
3,Limited Usefulness,"My main problem with this book is that it is based on the incorrect assumption that strangers are primarily responsible for sexual abuse and abduction of children. Most offenders are people a child knows, most often family members. When an individual is looking for children to abuse, they often become friends with the family and child before beginning to abuse. Including information about strangers is useful, but focusing on that possibility leaves a child vulnerable to sexual preditors that s/he knows."
4,toy soldiers,I enjoyed this movied years ago..I was thrilled to see it & order it..Good action/drama movie & of course I love Sean Ashton!Especially the teens! they would love this one!
4,A fun movie and the product arrived fast and in perfect condition,"This is a cute movie with some great actors, it arrived fast and in great condition, and I recomend this movie to anyone looking for a fun action movie that kids and teens may enjoy."
4,For me it's a classic!,"I saw this movie years ago and after watching recently on DVD, I'm still convinced that it's a great movie...I will watch this one over and over again."
4,Rejects Rally!,"I hadn't seen this in years, but I am glad I went ahead and bought it. I watched it again last night and found it was still as entertaining as the first time I saw it. Good cast, story, effects, and music make it a good buy. The scary thing with this movie is the reality factor. Considering the problems we have had with foreign relations, drug cartels, and the Virginia Tech incident with Cho, you have to give this story some credibility. I had forgot Ermey was in this, so it was a pleasant surprise. Astin and Gossett turn in great performances. I like this movie because it takes regular students and shows how their ingenuity and determination helps them to save all but one student from terrorist. Perhaps that is melodramatic, but at least it shows a plan and action and not just posturing. I recommend this to fans of action movies."
3,Excellent movie,This is a good movie to watch and prepare your selfincase terrorists were to take over your son or daughter'sschool.There's not a whole lot of action in this but it'sgot some very good drama performance's buy Sean Astin.Sean is one of my favorite actor's and this is one of hisbest starring role's.I have not gotten this on dvd yet nordo I own the vhs.But it's been on the movie channel's alot.If your a Sean Astin fan you'll love this movie.It's anunder rated film but it also has some great actor's in it.I suggest for every Sean Astin fan to own this on dvd or vhs.
3,This movie rocks!,"I would describe this movie as Die Hard but with teenagers.It is a bit a cheesy,then again the movie was made in 1991.Despite that this is a movie ONE MUST OWN!! I mean come on it's got Wil Wheaton,Sean Astin(who has become my most favorite actor by the way, you should all read his book There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale) and the dude who was in Adventure's in Babysitting(love that movie too).This movie is loads of fun, it's one of those movies you watch with a bunch of your friends while eatin' pizza.I just watched this movie and I am proud to now have this movie in my DVD collection."
5,A fan of Sean Astin,"I just love Sean Astin & he should have been awarded for his work on this film. I've been looking for this film on DVD for a long time! Thanks, Amazon. Also,after watching Return of the King, recently released, He really deserved an Oscar for his portrayal of Sam!!!!!!!"
5,I love the 80's,"it is unexplainable why I love this movie the way I do but its just great. I put it up thier with back to the future, teen wolf, big, and all the other 80's greats"
2,Toy Soldiers due to inept bad guys,"This movie begs many questions of the viewer. First, how exactly does building airplanes equate to building bombs? Second, How do you expect to blow up a school with a garage door opener strapped to your wrist? Third, How do vertical lashings equate to horizontal scars? I could go on but I'll spare you the trouble. I think you get the point by now. This movie gets one star for each Reebok pump sneaker that appears, but it is terrible..."
4,Good stuff :-),"I really only got this album for a few songs, but I love the movie. In a way, I love the songs more when they're in the movie because you can really feel how they mesh with the the theme of the movie.Excellent stuff!"
3,It's the soundtrack to the movie..what else can you say?,"If you like the music in the movie, this is it! I bought it for ""Cuban Pete"", which I thought was a catchy little latin-flavored number. You may have other favorites. I was kinda surprised to find the soundtrack...its not a movie exactly known for its musical score. But as I said earlier, if you liked the movie you'll like this."
5,Too much fun...,This cd is one of our family favorites. It does have some songs that might not be appropriate for everyone but we liked the majority of it and have practically worn it out.
1,Don't order from this group,"today is the 8th of April, 2009. On the 4th of march, I ordered a total of five items from amazon. The other 4 that I ordered came within a week. over a month later, I have YET to receive my item purchased from this company. I contacted once and they said it was on its way. I contacted them a second time and they never responded. While I am a frequent shopper from this, amazon.com, ive never been more disappointed by an online shopping experience."
3,The Mask movie score,It may be okay with some people but the people that sold me this c.d did not inform me that it was a score and not the actuall music.
4,Love it,This is not easy to find... I love the music for this as it is very theatrical and wonderful to dance to for choreographic purposes
4,hate to love,"why i love this movie is still a mystery to me. the acting is okay, the effects are good,the soundtrack is terrible,there are mistakes in logic for example when he puts his arm through the window to pick up the apple he does. when he is in the 4d state he goes through all objects..but even after all these negative issues i still love this movie. i guess because when your young you don't see the mistakes. if the movie has heart and it grabs you,it just stays with you all your life."
2,4dman-whatever...,"...the vhs video quality is aweful; the movie needs more action. when 4dman touches u, u get ole-it starts to happen in mid film but i dont know why so late. this is all i can say about this film; its just barely entertaining. its just ok."
2,Let's be honest.,"This is a so-so sci-fi pic from the late 60s -- nothing more, nothing less. To claim otherwise you'd have to be either deluded, or have a personal investment in the film."
4,"THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, DARKLY","I am so pleased to finally see this wonderful Sci-Fi film being released after so many years. Years ago it had been announced as a release on LaserDisc, but was subsequently cancelled. It was also available for sale on VHS briefly; later it was only available as a rental, but now...it's going to be on DVD! This is the story of a man's experiments in getting two solid objects to exist in the same space. As his experiments progress, he is changed by the process in ways he did not anticipate. His life and his relationship with his fiancee change dramatically. This film had some interesting special effects for its time, and Robert Lansing, as the scientist who conducts the experiments, does a marvelous job with the material. Lee Merriwether (Catwoman of the Batman TV series fame) also stars as the scientist's fiancee. This has been one of my favorite Sci-Fi films over the years (maybe because of its rare appearances on TV and video). Worth the purchase for Sci-Fi fans!"
5,A Personal Favorite!,"4D Man is to me one cool flick. Just the scene where he is experimenting and gets part of his hand stuck in metal had mefreakin squirming! Add to that hot babes, a cool hipster outrageous jazz soundtrack and its done nicely in color, its just one of those semi unknown horror flicks that are cool to watch. Highly recommended."
2,"Worth remaking, not sure about watching","This is strictly for completists who care about 50s scifi. There's a great premise buried inside this clunky film, which is how two brothers pursuing separate scientific breakthroughs can converge and then separate, based not on science, but morality and ethics. There's a decent turn by former Miss America Lee Meriweather and the two leads are ok, but the direction is clunky and corny and it's generous to call it a 'b' movie. Still, aficionados might find the bare bones of the story and way vfx were handled in that period kind of amusing, somewhat educational! And it's a better story at its heart than most movies today, so it gets a star just for story points!"
2,4D Man is pretty goofy,I love old 50s and 60s sci-fi movies. This movie started out pretty good but the idea of when he touches someone and they age hit me as lame. I would have had it where he could slightly solidify and it would act like a knife. Oh well the basic idea at first was cool but just petered out.
3,wrong format,"This a Sci-fi B movie from the late 50s with a interesting story and the effects are for this age OK. The fact is, they had not CGI effects!The movie isn't restored but watchable. The only thing I don't like: it's the wrong format. It was filmed in Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 but the DVD is in 4:3.In a small role you can see a very young Patty Duke."
4,Great lesser known sci-fi!!,I was really impressed with 4 D Man . A good story with great acting and super effects. The only thing that could have made it better is if it was filmed in black and white. I just love the atmosphere of the 50's B&W; sci-fi's.Great late 50's sci-fi tale for an even better price. Pick it up already!!
4,A penetrating story,"Dr. Tony Nelson (James Congdon) is working on a device that will enhance the brains ability to move things into the fourth dimension. Turns out due to some fluke of nature that his brother Dr. Scott Nelson (Robert Lansing) does not need enhancing. What does absolute power do? You guessed it.Now let's see Roy Parker (Robert Strauss) wants Scott's position; does he get it? Dr. Theodore W. Carson (Edgar Stehli) wants Scott's invention; does he get it? Scott's fiancé wants Scott's brother; does she get him. Scott wants money from the local bank; does he get it?Oh, come on now. Some one ought to get something in the end."
4,Desa Blower,Have not used alot yet do to an accident but does seem to work well. It does not move alot of air which for my use is perfct.
5,Excellent source of current (1997) knowledge & treatment,"After reading several other books on autism, I recommend this one as an up-to-date summary. One source for current ""medical"" understanding of autism. Excellent overview and perspective on multiple treatment approaches. This is a super first or only book for genearl information on autism."
5,Excellent reference for parents and educators. Wonderful!,"A well researched book by an extremely qualified author. Excellent information on various interventions and treatments. This topic can be quite cut and dry, but this author has a wonderful writing style that makes the topic less clinical. It will appeal to parents, professionals and others interested in Autism. (I am the father of a 7 year old with autism)"
5,It REALLY is an overview.,"Why it should be so hard to find a book that thoughtfully discusses the myriad of autism treatments, I don't know. As a parent of a child diagnosed last year at age three, I appreciate this book.Thank you Shirley Cohen for writing it. Thank you Amazon, for making it so easy to find."
5,"Well written, even handed, for parents and educators.","As a parent af an Autistic son I found this to be very informative and fair as it describes the various intervention models of today. Excellent, quotes from parents, educators, practitioners and Autistic kids and adults. Recommend highly"
4,"Very informative,","Very easy to read in layman's terms. As the mother of a four year old with PDD, I would suggest this book as a great book to start off with if your child was diagnosed with autism or pdd. It touches on a lot of areas ABA, schooling etc. without getting to technical. It also has statements and examples made by adults with autism/pdd which I found very interesting."
3,well . . . maybe two stars,"A mixed bag . . . Journey to the Center of the Earth, reworked without lyrics has its moments, but eventually becomes background filler. I was surprised to read the liner notes and discover that the backing musicians were human. All instruments except the keyboard sound terribly automated. The Yes covers are mostly an embarrassment. Going for the One and Don't Kill the Whale are almost painful to listen to from this exceptional musician. Bright Spots - I did rather enjoy Wonderous Stories more than the original (lacking Jon's voice). Sea Horses and Catherine of Aragon were quite nice as well, but not worth the price of 2 disks."
1,Disappointing! Static 80s sounding arrangements.,"Having read the two reviews here, and being familiar mostly with Rick's work with Yes and his earlier solo CDs, I thought, 'hey, instrumentals of Yes music done by Rick would be nice background music.' Whoa, wrong! These are static arrangements using 80's digital sample players, with a heavily-Korg-based sound. Okay, they're polished compared to what your average MIDIkid might do in his bedroom, but so boring and commercial and just plain mundane that I don't think I'll be able to stand listening to these discs a third time. And should an instrumental arrangement of ""Roundabout"" really be LONGER than the original? If this is typical of Wakeman's later work, I don't want to hear it! I certainly won't buy any more 90's Wakeman without a thorough investigation. Since I have always considered Wakeman to be one of the great prog keyboardists, this is a severe disappointment."
2,Need Lots of Proofreading,"I am so disappointed with this book. From Chapter 1, it refers in its exercises to files which do not exist and the files which do exist are already completed when the exercises refer to it being the starting point. I echo the other reviewer's comments, ""what's the point of it if it's already completed?"" Alex Michael should take a page from the Lynda Weinman's series, and writer Rosanna Yeung's detailed yet, easy to follow and well-illustrated book, ""Flash MX 2004 Hands-on Training"". What a waste of money for ""Animating with Flash MX"". I'm better off creating my own exercises for my students instead of using this book as my text."
2,Full of Mistakes and Inaccuracies,"I guess the title pretty much says it all. Oh, expect that over half of the example files I opened had already been completed. What's the point? To start from the end of the example and work backwards to undo what you're going to turn around and redo? I only got thru the first two or three chapters of this book before I returned it and bought ""Macromedia FLash MX HOT Hands-On Training""."
2,Less technique rather plug-n-play,"The techniques in this book are extremely basic as well as superficial. There is very little ""how or why"" a technique (or script) is being used, which prevents you from customizing the examples for your own use beyond replacing the graphics with your own. There are many spelling and other grammatical errors. For instance, the error ""optimisation"" (should be ""optimization"") is found throughout the book. I was disappointed with this purchase quite a bit."
2,Useless for the beginner- not recommended,"This book is a complete and utter disappointment. Nothing is explained well, you are just told to ""do this"" and then ""do that"".Typos everywhere as well, and in the places where you really don't want to have typos- the instructions. Many of the things you are told to do are just flat out wrong- leading to extreme confusion and frustration in the various project steps. I had to give up on this book because the examples don't even work when you follow the directions. That and I absolutely hate those Ellen and Zak kids, the examples in every chapter.BUT I did find a great book that I recommend 100% for people new to Flash. I was comfortable with Flash animation after working through the first couple of chapters in ""Macromedia Flash MX 2004: Hands on Training"" by Yeung and Weinman. I recommend that book extremely highly, and I recommend you search it out and buy it immediately. Forget about this other crummy book."
5,An international hit!,"I read this charming story to a kindergarten class and we all had the best time, enjoying the pictures, making predictions and roaring over the deadpan humor. I'll be getting the other Boo and Baa titles for my school library."
5,Cute stuff... and very clever,"This pair of Swedish sheep are the heroes of several much-beloved books... This is the only one I've seen, but it's a favorite around our house, and I look forward to tracking a few more of these books down and checking them out. Here, Boo and Baa are out doing some yardwork when a little black-and-white cat gets stuck in a tree, and when they try to get it down, Boo winds up a tree himself. The most captivating thing about these books is the kooky sense of humor: it's very, very subtle, but very, very sweet. Also, for those of us looking for nonviolent entertainment that isn't completely bland, this is a wonderful option. This is best for the littlest readers, but parents will appreciate the nuances of Landstrom's artwork, and the gentle, calming vibe of the story. Recommended. (ReadThatAgain!)"
5,Irresistible humor for little kids,"This is a wonderful book about the adventures of two sheep that work in their garden and discover a cat up in the tree. The story is simple and funny, the drawings are cute. My girls (3 and 5 yrs) both love the book and crack up when we read it. They like to re-enact the story too. Too bad that the book seems to be out of print as are other Boo and Baa titles. We got a used book in good condition. For Boo and Baa fans: one can buy small Boo and Baa dolls from Sweden."
2,Saga of the Sierras,"I purchased all five of the Sierra books by the Thoene's and for the most part, I was disappointed in this series. I was spell bound by the Zion Covenant series and am now starting the Zion Chronicles but something was just not right with the Sierra series. I love good westerns but could hardly wait until I finished and found myself skipping pages. I believe the Zion books are wonderful and I read one right after another and could hardly put them down."
2,Beautiful couch throw but,"This is a beautiful sofa throw but what I didn't like about it was that it only stops at the top of sofa. It's not long enough. It's great with width from arm to arm but not from feet to back. Picture yourself sitting on sofa. The throw starts at your feet, up to the seat where you sit, and goes up behind you, and then stops at the top. Sitting down alot will make that throw fall down behind you. If it was long enough to go over the back and down almost to the floor in the back of couch, I would have kept the sofa throw. They should add another 60 inches."
5,Beautiful,"The combination of stunning photography and memorable prose in this book makes it an excellent choice for anyone interested in churches, history, simple architecture, or words. It is a joy both to look at and to read."
4,Elephants DO have good memories,"Elephant tails can be 5 feet long, African elephants can be 13 feet high and Asian elephants can weigh 12,000 pounds. These are just a few of the many fascinating facts children will learn by reading this book. Children may know that elephants do have good memories, but they might not have known that elephants walk on tiptoes, flap their big ears to keep cool, and that their trunks can reach higher than a giraffe. Wonderful photographs accompany the interesting text."
3,hardware construction seems sturdy but...,The wall bracket has small holes that are used to secure it to the wall. The wall anchors I have are too big to fit through the hole of the bracket. I will have to enlarge the holes but drilling them out or find stronger anchors that require smaller holes.
4,Easy to install and looks great,"I live in a tiny home and had been looking for a convenient way to hang my road bike within my limited space. This rack is perfect. I was able to install it in minutes and now, my bike is not only out of the way (no more rolling it around and banging into walls), but hangs like a piece of art."
4,"Happy with this product, with a couple caveats","Works as advertised for our two mountain bikes. The instructions were a bit off - it says to mark up 12"" from the tire mark for the top hole...but 12"" up is too far. Just use common sense. Also, I stripped the included philips screw heads, even after drilling a pilot hole. I ended up using my own wood screws. I also used a single screw to attach the bottom plastic plate to the wall, instead of the stick strip. It looks like they intended that as an option, since the plate has two circular spots - I just drilled out the top one. I reviewed a lot of different bike hanging options, and am happy I went with this one. Note that I haven't used them extensively yet, so no feedback on wear over time."
4,good solid rack,"This rack is nice and solid and holds the bike well. It works especially well when you can anchor to a stud, but it's been OK so far for me in the first few months anchored into concrete with included wallplugs. I set mine up so that the back wheel would usually be resting on the ground, to reduce the load on the hook.I also bought the bottom tire holder to protect the wall. It's OK - doesn't really serve much purpose, and it's a matter of opinion whether a lump of plastic is less of an eyesore than a tire mark on the wall. After a year or so, I repainted the wall and chucked out the plastics.I use a variety of sizes of bikes on these, and so far they've all been OK. Positioning of the bottom tire holder isn't going to perfect for all bikes if you use for more than one.After a couple of years of almost daily use, some of the rubber coating on the hook is coming off, but otherwise, rack is doing fine."
3,I'm sure it should work fine...,"But I tried to install this on a wall and with 3 holes ripped out of the wall later, the bike rack is sitting on my desk. The bike isn't even that heavy (comparatively speaking). For anyone who decides to buy this, think about acquiring a stud finder as well. I am not blaming the product by any means and will try to install it on another wall. I will update when I do!"
3,Not too bad,"The product is great. The mounting hardware is bad. I hung the rack per the instructions and supplied hardware. I hung the bike and about 10 minutes later the rack ripped out of the wall (5/8"" sheet rock). Then I used industrial screw mollies. Yup, ripped out of the wall. Now I have 4 holes in my wall and the bike is sitting in front of the closet. I assumed my bike was more than 40 lbs but its only 39 lbs. My next move is to mount it to a stud. I'm sure that will be fine but It won't be in the exact spot I want it."
1,does not stay on dry wall,"first of all just want to say that i have a road bike, and its less than 40lbs. it holds the bike right after install. but when i put the back on for the 2nd time. it pulls the wall rack out and made 2 holes on the wall.they should make an angle down the screws and not flat into the wall!"
4,does what it says,"Was easy to put up and it holds my bike. Has a hard time finding a place to put it. Don't want it anywhere that you could run into bike cause it will not hold it in place. was pretty much what I expected, does what it says."
5,Great Bike Rack,This is a great bike rack.... does just what is ment to do....Easy to hook the bike on and the tire rest for the wall save thewall from getting messed up
4,Great Product,"This is a great product, I purchased 3 of them to get my bikes up off the floor in the garage, they hold the front tire well.My only complaint about the product is it ships with some pretty weak philips ( star-shaped ) screws. I had these stripped in no time requiring extra time to get the stripped screws out and replaced with ones i had lying around the house. It would be nice to see some better screws included."
1,Doesn't work if you have MTB,"It doesn't withstand the weight of an average mountain bike. It's a bike rack designed only for very light ones. Unfortunately, they not warn you before you buy your product."
2,Good Design... Needs Better Anchors,These are great but be ready to go to your local hardware store and pick up some better wall anchors. The ones that come with them can barely support the weight of a bike.
4,"Works as advertised, little hard to use","Works great, installation was pretty simple - just find a stud. It can be a bit of a pain to actually hang the bike though (especially if it's a bit heavier), which can be annoying if you use it frequently. That's not really the fault of this particular product though, more a problem with any vertical bike rack like this."
5,FANTASTIC RACK!,"I have no idea why anyone could complain about this rack. Its incredibly easy to install (under 10 minutes) and even better, getting the bike on and off was incredibly easy and effortless. I have a hybrid bike and don't get what all the tire size fuss is all about.I was ready to use toggle bolts but got lucky and the stud was right where I needed it. I'm not big on measuring, so I held the bike about where I wanted it, marked it, placed the hook about 6 inches above that, marked the holes in the hook, drilled the holes and hung the rack. I have the bike only a couple of inches above the ground (I'm a woman, why make it harder to lift than necessary?). The rear tire holder was just as easy. Anyone with a very rudimentary knowledge of drilling holes into studs and recognizing that you probably need something a little more robust than what they include, will not have a problem. Inexpensive rack, with a simple, great design. Just ordered the second one for the other bike in the house."
4,As Shown,"The product was as expected and shown in the photo. My bike is an expensive triathlon bike and I was nervous it would damage the wheels, but all seems to be okay. It was very easy to hang and it is easy for me to retrieve my bike. For a small apartment or space, I think this rack is the way to go."
5,easy and durable stand,"I mounted my speed bike in a very tight office space near a window.the installation took 5 minutes. always remember to measure twice cut once. for the price and the amount of space it saves, its a great product."
4,Simple solution for a crowded space,"I recently installed the Delta Leonardo and Da Vinci Tire Rack in my two car garage. One rack was installed with the recommended 12"" clearance for the rear tire off the floor. I mounted the other 16"" away (next stud over), but staggered it by raising the hook height by 12"". It's a little harder to put the bike up, but allows you to really nest two bikes together.Two bikes, next to each other, taking up little valuable space...that's simple. Why only four stars? There is always room for improvement in any product...four is as high as I go."
3,harder to use than it ought to be,"This hook does everything it says it will. It installs reasonably quick (if you have a good stud to work with), is a pleasant looking design and holds my bicycle to the wall. My gripe with this product is that due to the shape of the hook it takes concerted effort to mount and dismount my bicycle. The hook is bent unnecessarily far - they've made it so it'll hold my bike through an earthquake. I plan to remove some of the curl out of the hook to make it easier to get the rim of my front wheel onto/off of the hook."
5,Works perfectly,Top screw takes all the weight so be sure it is well anchored. Mounted mine on a door jamb
3,Only good for road bikes,"I agree with the other reviewer. This works fine for a road bike tire, preferably one with a light weight frame. Mountain bike tires are too difficult to put on and remove, particularly if your not a weight lifter. I am mountainmom's husband, am reasonably strong and still strugggle to get the bikes with fat tires on and off. Once they are on there, it holds them well. Also the rubber coating was easily cut by the spokes."
3,Sturdy,"Easy to install and stronger than it looks. Rubber coating on hook is fraying after less than a year of use, though. I hope it doesn't damage my rims."
5,The Best out there!!!!,"A Mi Manera is by far my favorite song. Better and more colorful than Frank Sinatra's ""My Way!"""
4,not your traditional harmony but in a good way,the sounds of these guys' voices is soothing to hear. would like to know what they are saying in the other languages though.
3,Ok but not the best thing ever.,"I just bought this CD and while the guys all have fantastic voices and the arrangements were ok I thought the choice of songs was mediocre. Basically I was underwhelmed. I will enjoy listening to it but after all the hype I expected more. It just didn't pop for me, I guess."
2,Recording quality is poor,I have never had to adjust the volume so much as on this cd. Songs are ok but the volume change is awful. A song can go from too soft and quiet to unbearably loud. This is too bad as I would like it if I didn't have to change the volume during each song.
2,Lousy as a group,"I was so excited when first knowing such a young, multicultural and classical trained group was coming out. Now I feel lucky I didn't buy the album, only listened to it once on my Napster trial, and that was quite enough. These guys failed to justify my expectation. They have fantastic voices individually. But the voices don't even come close to blend when they sing together, which downright wreck the would-be romantic tunes. I give them 2 stars for the loudness and their individual voices.Shame on all the media bombast. There are artists that deserve it better."
2,So boring...,"Great voices, romantic songs, but so boring...Not a spark of emotion, everything is dull and overpolished.I'll stay with Andrea Bocelli."
1,Hysterically overbearing,"Oh, so now we get it, Simon Cowell: your idea of great singing is not one, not two, not even three, but FOUR bombastic, classically trained vocalists, blasting out intimate love songs to Kingdom Come...in unison!!! Laughably awful.Warning: side-effects of listening to ""Il Divo"" may include sugar diabetes and punctured eardrums."
5,Il Divo,"I was delighted in how fast shipment arrived, but not as delighted as this TERRIFIC cd. From the 1st song to the last, it is very delightful."
1,"An American, a Frenchman, a Spaniard and a Swiss walk into a bar...","So, Simon Cowell searches the globe for the best opera singers he could find and all we get is this lousy hairshirt of a musical act? Four quasi-talented vocalists with faces right out of gay porn? Their proclivity is toward the house-frau demographic, like an adult Backstreet Boys reunion tour, only the sounds are straight out of Muzak heaven, each pretentious over-melodramatic dirge more consistently inharmonious than the next. Clay Aiken is Pavarotti by comparison, Lindsay Lohan is Aretha Franklin. Howlingly misguided, terminally ill-fated. It will make a fortune. My grade: E+"
1,GAG..................,"Oh my...this is AWFUL!!!!!!!And I am a HUGE FAN of Josh Groban---PLEASE do NOT assume that Josh Groban fans will like this MESS. These guys might be 'cute', but WHO CARES? I don't buy a CD to stare at the the CD cover. And I have news for SIMON and all those other people who think that Josh sold 12 MILLION CD's mostly because he is 'cute'...what an idiotic thing to believe...NO, I didn't even know what Josh looked like before I bought his first CD. Josh has the voice of the century, and these four guys don't come anywhere CLOSE. Sure, they have OK voices--like about 50 million other guys singing in church choirs. To think that one of the 'requirements' for getting picked for this foursome was that one had to be good-looking is an INSULT to the music-buying public. And after listening to these guys sing all-the-same sappy songs for five minutes I wanted to GAG....and I hurried to put Josh Groban back on...and then my other CD's such as Sting or Seal or Ray Charles.....sigh....."
4,Awesome CD,"This cd was just awesome. The blending of voices is remarkable.I loved it! Definitely goes down on my ""Best CD's List"".This is a must hear CD!"
5,BRAVO,One of the best CDs I have There voices are just beautiful and they blend well together These young men will only get better and better and I will be right there buying every single one of there CDs
5,Il Divo,"This group proves beyond a doubt that music has a universal language, one that stirs emotions, yet giving peace to the soul and mind. This is by far the best vocal CD I've purchased in a long time. I have only one question--when do they release the next one?P.S. This CD also proves that Simon has a soul!!!!"
5,Heaven's Sake! Give The Guys Their Due!,"I LOVE these songs. These men have smooth harmony and sing beautifully. Let negative reviewers get up and sing; I'm sure THEY sound wonderful.Bravo, Simon Cowell."
5,Simon thx for bringing civility back...,"What a pleasure to see a group of talented young men who do not have visible piercings or tatoo's...their clothes are not hanging off their a**ses and they are just down right clean cut.I have a ""tween"" who is constantly bombarded by images of young men in other ""boy"" groups who just look like slobs and appear to have NO manners or respect. I have to congratulate Simon on bringing back civility and class to the music biz....I would love if my daughter would bring home one of these boys!"
2,I feel as though i've been assaulted!,"I can see how this might appeal to some people, but personally, i agree with others that say this is TOO LOUD. The four of these guys sound like a bad trainwreck when singing together. After listening to as much as i could bear to stand, i really feel as though i might need some rest.I give these guys 2 stars instead of one because i think they are actually talented singers, given the right material and and less cheese."
1,American Idol producer tries to make a fool of us once again,"Just put four guys together, have them sing old songs (very loudly) in a foreign language, introduce them on Oprah.Does that sound like a formula for making out a deposit slip on your way to the bank?I received this CD along with a dozen roses for my anniversary with the cover of four rejects from the Male Model Contest. Apropos for a reality show *genius.*Roses die quickly, but they lasted longer than my endurance of this screaming songfest. Is there a 99 cent bin, where I can toss this horror?"
1,Nice attempt at bringing Opera to a new generation but...,"The hunky looks of this foursome may make you swoon but their voices may make you cringe! They tend to over power each other's vocals when they sing as an ensemble as if trying to out ""Divo/Diva"" one another. You wind up running to the volume control to turn it down! I was given this album as a gift and wound up playing it only once. Watching them perform live on TV definitely showed that they are coyly trying to out do each other vocally. Having the Backstreet Boys' producers on board can tell you that there's a hint of desperation to get young listeners turned on to opera. Your best bet is to pick up a copy of ""Carreras Domingo Pavarotti ~ The Three Tenors in concert"" for some real good ensemble vocals, or ""Amici Forever - The Opera Band"" if you are looking for a fresh, new, young perspective on opera. Perhaps Il Divo's producers will learn from their mistakes and reduce the volume on the microphones for the next album (if there is one)."
5,A Feast to Your Eyes and Ears!!!!,"This is like the opera dream team. All four of them are not only handsome but they have outstanding voices on their own. Somehow they found a way to blend their voices to make magic ...You listen to them and you sigh...The baritone Spaniard, the American tenor, the pop music Frenchman that adds sweetness to the pot, and our man from Switzerland with his sexy long hair and wonderful tenor voice.This group will appeal even to non opera fans.Mayra S. Washington"
2,Disappointed,"Somehow I thought I was buying an album on which Il Divo sang at least a few songs in English. No such luck. Most of the music was totally unfamiliar to me, and although is is of course beautifully sung, it's not a sing-along album for me! And I do sing along with familiar operettas and operas as well as most (Egnlish-language) vocal music.If your Italian is good, you might love it."
3,Good group,I really like the tight harmony that sometimes lacks with these guys. Sometimes it sounds like they are trying to out sing each other.
3,Il Divo,Pleasant introduction to a different type of CD. Very professional and pleasing to listen to. You need to enjoy listening to unknown music in a foreign language.
2,Il Divo,"These gentlemen have a wonderful blend. I would only have preferred more of the pieces in English, but the music is wonderful. ""Unchained Melody"" took me back a few years."
1,Cowel still doesn't get it and has outsmarted himself.,"When I heard about this CD and that Simon Cowell had awakened to the fact that the ""middle aged female market"" (Clay Aiken fans) was underserved, I was thinking that Rip Van Winkle finally woke up.However, I've listened to this CD and find that it all sounds like opera and very ""put on."" It's true some people like opera--I like a tiny bit of it now and then--but I'm not into The Three Tenors nor any imitation of them. Middle aged women are looking for good rock and pop, not antique, music. As a senior, and a first-generation rock 'n' roller, I know the difference between good music and a misguided marketing gimmick. This is the latter. I'm going to plug into my iPod now, and I think I'll start with ""Blood Makes Noise."" Preferably Cowell's."
1,Extreme Disappointment,"I couldn't wait for this album to come out... and after 30 minutes I couldn't wait to take it out of my stereo! The problem is when all of the men sing together. It is not mixed in a way that maximizes the harmonies of the music. It sounds as if one is singing in front with a backup band behind. Also, at times the background music overpowers the voices. This album could have been so much more...."
1,Watch Out! Music Bosses Are Created Almost Perfect Product!,"Oh help me God! I can't believe why so many cover bands are so popular. Maybe the judgment day is coming soon! Luckily, then I can hear only real and pure music.Il Divo is something like Gregorian(Master of Chant) but much worse. These boys have really good voice but I can't understand why don't they song more about own songs.Cover songs like Mama and Unbreak My Heart are good ones performed by original artists but these qu**r boys r**e excelent songs.I hate easy riders who use other artist's classic song to get success, glory and many. Il Divo is wisely made boy band that has greedy back forces(dark forces). Gold fingers rules these boys to get butter on their bread. LONG LIVE THIEVES!"
1,ILL SICKO,"GAY......Listening to these guys ravishing in their selfishly garnished egos only to top each other off in this utterly afflicting, mediocore, melodical onslaught is as bad as watching scantly-clad men owning each other in the mud ring.....nasty!"
1,New Kids on the Block Meet Opera,"Having listened to this album I am disturbed by the fact that disgusting elements from the World of pop have decided it is not enough to fabricate stars in their own field of influence, but to transgress into the classical World with this tripe. Il Divo should be renamed Il Trivio as it is trivial manufactured rubbish. There is not one decent tenor voice amongst them, and if their record label thinks that dressing four good looking guys in designer suits creates opera talent, then they are mistaken. Spend you hard earned money on real singers!"
1,Ugh.,"Really. When one bad tenor insists on singing it's bad enough, but four bad tenors at once? What did we do to deserve this? Well, we can't really expect great things from Simon Cowell, can we? I don't even need to buy this CD to know that it would horrible. Just from the samples available on Amazon, it sounds like they are all trying to outsing each other, which in turn causes them to strain, which causes them to go sharp. This is like Ashlee Simpson. Why would someone really, genuinely think this is good? It disgusts me. If I could give it a rating of negative stars, I would."
1,Tenors out of tune.,"I listened to the samples of this groups' songs and did not like it at all. It sounds like they are trying to outsing each other. Their voices sounds like they are imitating the 3 tenors but did not quite made it. I will not buy the CD even if you give me a hundred bucks. That's what I think of this group Il Divo (really bad sound and bad song selection). So Simon you're not really a good judge, I don't know why you say all those nasty words at some of the contestants in Amercian Idol. This group of yours sounds really bad, it needs fine tuning."
1,"IL CHEESO: Cheesy, hysterically bad, preening mess...","Omigod... I am still laughing hysterically from having heard the first single, a ridiculously over dramatized cheeseball version of Toni Braxton's Unbreak my heart... IL DIVO are even cheesier than the Toni Braxton version, its cheesy video, and their cheesy name would suggest... It makes me sad that this passes for moving, well-made music and that ""formally trained"" singers have to resort to Menudo-style cheesy commercialism to become famous and critically acclaimed... IL DIVO indeed... how funny... They should be called Il Cheeso!!!!"
5,Il Divo simply devine!!!,"Even if you already bought their CD when it first came out I would suggest you buying the Dual Disc. Not only is the sound better (imagine!) BUT you also get Unchained Melody, the video for Unbreak My Heart AND the show from Gotham Hall in New York. Watching them perform at this show is so special, words fail me. Their voices are the best I have ever heard. I can't wait to hear their next album (and their upcoming Christmas one also). This CD is a must have in every record collection."
3,"Lots of gloss, little substance","Swayed by the reviews, I bought this album only to be disappointed by it. The four singers have decent voices. They sound better individually than when they sing in unison. There is little soul in this album. It's mostly glittery performance with little real feel for the songs. I came away with the impression that this is primarily a nice looking ""boy-band"" with a slightly classical flavor. It's pleasant background music but not something to really listen to in earnest."
3,"such a great group, I wanted a little more from this CD","Their voices blend so well together, I love this group, but why don't they record in English once in a while?"
5,Great Album,"I first saw this album when it first came out and bought it because of the guys looks, (I was 13...) but after listening, fell in love with the combination of their voices. This is a great album and I love to listen to it while studying."
3,A Word Of Caution,"I listened to the sample set to see if I wanted to buy this album. Anyway, I listened to the songs and I do like the richness of their voices. I just felt there is something lacking in the material. Most of the songs we know, like ""Unbreak My Heart"" and Sinatra's ""My Way"". A key note, if it worked great the first time, doesn't always mean the same formula will work, again. I am a great fan of original work. Usally when music is written in a way that is unforgettable, it is very difficult for someone else to come in and make the same song appealing. If producers relize you can't ""sell"" everyone. The talent will show through and it would work well for this quartte."
2,What's the fuss?,"The quartet group has a good name; the singers look attractive; the materials, however, are neither refreshing, nor inspiring. Half of the songs are old tunes recycled - some are very poorly rearranged, e.g. Nella Fantasia - the other half are rather bland. The music style is the same old pop/classical crossover, with no individuality whatsoever. The voices, after studio engineering, sound easy on the ear but only when they are heard singularly. When singing together, they haven't quite found the harmony yet. I've also watched their performance in concert, which isn't all that impressive, either. Simon Cowell said, ""they are going to be huge"", but with what? I wonder."
3,Village People of 2004,Another manufactured group from talent search. Much better than the Idols stuff. Wonder how long will the gimic last!
3,Sorry....It Doesn't Work,"No question that there's plenty of talent here, and this CD get my 3 stars for the talent alone. Song selection is a bit odd, but the real killer is the arrangement and/or mix. Sorry, 4 tenors singing in chorus doesn't work....and the CD hits the listener over the head with this almost constantly. Either the producers made some poor decisions or the engineering went unchecked....or some combination of such miscues. Hard to listen to while waiting for the occasional burst of talent."
1,"Whip it, whip it good",I was very disappointed by this CD. I was expecting more avante-garde post-modern 80s music. All I got was a bunch of lousy songs in some kind of moon-man language. Now for my parting words:When a problem comes alongYou must whip itBefore the cream sits out too longYou must whip itWhen something’s going wrongYou must whip itNow whip itInto shapeShape it upGet straightGo forwardMove aheadTry to detect itIt’s not too lateTo whip itWhip it good
2,Original? Yes. Tolerable? Not quite...,"I must hand it to Simon Cowell, this is an intriguing project. Taking classical (not new wave classical but REAL classical) and pop and attempting to meld the two together is an interesting notion. Ultimately, however, the band fails. First and foremost, Il Divo will never be able to escape the fact that they are a manufactured band, brought together by a talent search and, essentially, given everything they needed on a silver platter. Yes, it worked with the Sex Pistols and a few others, but bands created by a record company, for the most part, spew out whatever crap their adoring label wants them to. Their poppy take on classical will make fans of classical music despise their superficiality, their classical take on pop will make most pop-listeners dismiss them as boring or as a silly novelty. If you must buy this album, ""Nella Fantasia"" and ""Passera"" are better than most of the other tracks."
2,erm..uh...why?,"Maybe it's because I'm (probably) young compared to most of you, or maybe it's because I think Simon Cowell is a pretentious jerk who only knows about pop music (not a compliment, but when I actually listened to this c.d. when I was bored one day, I found myself asking 'why?'. ""Why do people enjoy this?"" Why did Simon Cowell see it fit to plague the world with not just crappy pop american idols, but these guys, too?"" ""Why did my friend buy this?"" It's just a bunch of boring guys singing boring songs they probably didn't write (i hate when people sing songs they didn't write. It just screams ""not a real artist""). The only reason that i gave the c.d. a 2 was because I have to admit the guys can sing. I can't, and I don't talk when I can't do the same. But theose boys have got some pipes....otherwise, it's a 1."
1,Hey - This is Total Cr@p,"This sounds like the Three Tenors meet Michael Bolton. Its the Classical/Operatic answer to InSync. Its the Vito Beefcake Muzak Hour. This is what Fabio would sound like if he could sing. If you opened up a can of Chef Boyardee and music came out, this is what you'd hear. If you pigged out on Italian food the night before, and took a big dump, this is what it would smell like.No wonder Oprah was pushing this swill - if Oprah's pushing it, you gotta know its total Cr@pola. To all you poor Oprah-obsessed sheep out there, who go out and buy anything she endorses, I pity you. Think for yourself.In conclusion Il Divo, Il Sucko."
4,Bravo!,Four very talented young men whose voices blend beautifully. Selection of music for the CD is excellent. I think we will hear a great deal from Il Devo in the future. I predicted the same for Josh Groban and Michael Buble.
3,Expected it to be better,"I was expecting this CD's music to be similar to Josh Groben or Andrea Bocelli. The selection of songs could be better.These guys have great voices and perform awesome individually. The singing together could benefit from some work as well as the selection of songs - perhaps the songs selected is not suitable for this group... I don't know - they DO have great voices, but there's something not right when they sing together.I give this 3 stars because these guys do have talent. I just expected it to be better."
3,Operatic Boy Band Courtesy of Cowell,"Talented, handsome singers individually, these lads are spoiled when they're thrown together in a mass-marketing scheme that is so blatant, it overshadows the music.Simon Cowell! Oprah! The Today Show! They're all screaming at you from the packaging...and the heavily retouched, moodily lit photographs of the singers broodingly suggests the female audience should prepare to start flinging their panties at the stereo.Unfortunately, in our AMERICAN IDOL obsessed society, the idea that ""less is more"" is virtually extinct and the integrity of these wonderful voices is lost beneath the elaborate gift wrapping of pop-opera-culture gone amok."
5,Simply Superb,"I just love El Divo. No group compares. This album is divine. I play it over and over again. But then, I am a huge fan."
4,Wife Collection,Addition to my wife collection of singer like Irish Tenors and Pavarotti - More great songs and voices - Buy
5,Hormones Rising,"I can't wait for their next CD!!! These fantastic, young, handsome, heart-throbbing, male tenors are absolutely what the classical world needs to get interest in classical music excited and panting for more!!!!! I heard this CD at my friend's house who purchased it on her vacation to England. I didn't want to go home....I couldn't get enough. The music... the voices brought me to my knees. I'm a big fan of Josh Grobin, but these guys are like having a variety of deserts and being unable to pick one ... you want them all! I defnitely want more. The three tenors , although older and more experienced leave you unfulfilled and almost finding polite excuses for these legends' forced and at times strained deliveries...it's like watching an old athlete straining to reach his goal. While, these young ""hotties"" sing effortlessly, they have an energy in their performance that reaches into every heart throb until you want to swoon in satisfying lyrical pleasure. WHAT AN ALBUM!!!!"
3,"Pretty good, but no Josh Groban","I bought this CD because I love my Josh Groban CDs and I was looking for something similar. These young men are very talented- besides being great looking. However, the CD gets a little heavy at time- like they are trying to outdo one another. Some of the songs I just have to laugh because they are so serious. For the most I will stick with my Josh Groban because he has so much more control, but overall, this is fine CD with some beautiful music. The cover is easy on the eyes also!"
1,Do not waste your money....,"What a joke! Is this what passes for classical music for the masses? Because it is neither classical nor music and the original performers of the songs would flip over if they heard Il Divo's renditions. These four guys just don't sing together, you basically hear four separate lines of music punctuated by pop music like breathing or the occasional baritone splurge of their best singer (Carlos). It is not even elevator music, at best you can call this musac. I don't know who compared them to Andrea Bocelli but it's a crime. Mr. Bocelli can sing and melt your heart out even in diluted classical music for the masses and can interpret them without ever moving from his spot. These guys...oh forget it, I'm running out of poor adjectives to use. Bottom line, don't waste your money or time. Maybe Aunt Margaret might like them since they are young and hunky and the melodies are ""pleasant"" to the untrained or undiscerning ear."
3,Just my review,"Recently I listen to this cd while i drive. My friend give me this cd and I'm kind of interested to listen to them because I'm also a big fan of Josh Groban voice. So, I wanna give Il Divo a try.First song I listen is ""Unbreak My Heart"" that was originally by Tony Braxton.. then I like..""Oh, I hate It!"". But when the track continue I think they are ok. The high note for some song sometimes bothering me when I sence sometimes it's not harmony enough. Anyway, there is at least 3 songs that i really enjoy from this CD and i'll continue listen to them. This CD is worth it to buy but if they didn't sing ""Unbreak My Heart"" I think i will be better because I have to skip this song everytime.I will no doubt looking for their next CD that i think already released."
4,Not great but still enjoyable.,"This is one of those CDs that had to grow on me as I wasn't in love with it the first few times I heard it. Individually, each singer in Il Divo has a fantastic voice; but collectively, I think they sometimes sound a bit competitive - as though each is trying to out-sing the other. Having said that, I still think this CD is a worthy addition to your collection and have actually come to enjoy listening to it now that I've become familar with the songs and the voices."
2,Il Divo Il Stinko,"Ugh...where do I begin. This album is terrible. There, plain and simple. Now, don't get me wrong. I love Josh Groban, Mario Frangoulis, Charlotte Church, Joshua Payne, and all of the others that actually suceed in this pop/opera genre. But Il Divo is marketing gone crazy! Now, they all have beautiful voices, and solo careers for each of them would be better than this terrible GROUP. The songs are horrible. And I just can't get over the fact that they remade Toni Braxton's ""Unbreak My Heart"" and called it opera. Wow...I just don't understand this album. I just don't know what I'm listening to (and I don't mean the foreign languages.) Vocally, they all have beautiful voices, but as an album as a whole, they need to step it up a few notches before they get my respect."
2,Pretty but repetitive,"I bought this because everyone told me Divo had beautiful voices. They do, but what a monotonous CD! All the songs sound similar, and all sung the same way. The 3 Tenors are still in first place."
4,Lush Stuff,"I love the Spanish guitars, the operatic voices, the lush orchestration, the foreign languages (Spanish and Italian as well as English)and especially their version of Toni Braxton's very sexy ""Unbreak My Heart!"" I also thoroughly enjoy Andrea Bocelli's ""Romanza"" so if you are of that ilk, you will love Il Divo!"
3,On the fence about this one,"Being a HUGE fan of Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli, I figured I would enjoy the group as well. After listening to the album, I am kind of on the fence whether to recommend it or not. The songs and voices are beautiful, but I feel it really lacks the emotion and heartfelt singing that Josh and Andrea display in their music. It sounds too much like a manufactured, pre-packaged project for me to truly enjoy it. Just my opinion..."
5,My mom loves it!,"I bought this CD for my mom for Christmas and she has been playing it non-stop for a month now! Thank goodness I don't live with her! :) Every time I call her, she first has to go turn it down and then she comes back to the phone and tells me how much she loves it."
4,better than adequate,"I enjoyed the premier recordings of Il Divo, but there was not as much variety in styles as I expected. The voices are truely classical, and the blend is very soothing. I would, however, like to hear them record different styles of classical music."
1,What a joke.,"I guess these woefully inept boys are all right for bleating to sports audiences over a stadium PA system, but that's about as far as it goes. I'm sure they think listening to these guys gives them a little culture. Come to think of it, that is probably the case. Horses for courses, I guess.They are touted as bridging the gap between pop and classical. More accurately, they do neither well, dumbing down classical and blanding out pop. The fact that they do neither well does not make them gap-bridgers or crossover artists or anything except the the ill-begotten progeny of a money-hungry producer's greed and bad taste.Of course, he laughs all the way to the bank at his little joke on the public. As HL Mencken said, ""No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public""."
2,"Music is Good, dualdisc doesn't","I'm very dissappointed with this dualdisc, unfortunately this dualdisc is only a CD side and a DVD-Video side, I thought it would be a DVD-AUDIO side with high resolution audio and it's not, it has standard, compressed, lossy dolby digital audio in 5.1 channels, what's the point?, music is good, im just reviewing this dualdisc edition which doesn't really add any good to the standard CD version."
5,review of the Il divo cd,"This particular cd / dvd is one of my all time favourites..I'm a huge Il divo fan and to have the dvd is an extra bonus...thankyou amazon for keeping this in stock, it seems to be un available elsewhere and I've recommended this one to several other Il divo fans on their web site..."
5,Not Another Opera Band,"The title seems negative, but not meant to be. In fact, I got myself a copy of the regular CD.Sarah Brightman made the classical crossover genre popular and Amici (another opera band) made this ""Opera Band"" popular.What got me what Il Divo's rendition of ""Regressa Me"" (Spelling?). If you have access to Applue ITunes, they have a full music video free to stream. That is how I had to get their album.Besides the ""Regressa Me,"" others tracks are melodious as well and quite strung together well in regard to coherent voices of the members of Il Divo.Try it. If you are not satisfied, you can always try selling back on the Amazon.com Marketplace."
1,"Great talent, bad direction","The guys can sing. I'll give you that. But what on earth are they singing? Certainly nothing appropriate for them or their style. Taking guys from around the world and making a pop group was an interesting idea and, if done right, could have been something special. But Toni Braxton's ""Unbreak My Heart""??? Are you kidding me? The guys sound uncomfortable singing these songs and it makes me feel uncomfortable listening to it."
2,TOTAL TRIPE!,"Proves once again (ie 'Three Tenors') that there is nothing sillier sounding than male 'opera'(?) singers trying to wrap their over-trained vocal chords around simple pop songs.I agree with an earlier poster that 'Unbreak My Heart', which was written for and recorded superbly for Toni Braxton and sold like a ka-trillion records, is turned into a hammy, over-blown characture of that fantastic version.NEXT!"
3,great cd for gay men and house wives,they are so gay! from the way they look to the way they sing....they are catching all the desperate house wives and gay men's attention at the moment!
3,For The Most Part WELL DONE,"I really like all the love songs on this CD.They are very Well Done.We were only disapointed in one song on this CD which isMA MA because we could only make out a few words.And what we can hear sends a sentiment to a mom who has passed away which (thankfully) does not work for us.We were considering this song for our wedding but now have decided to stick to our first choice""A Song For My Son"" which we also found on amazon.com"
1,SO HOT!!!,"Il Divo is Il SUCKO! But Sebastien is super duper gorgeous! The others are okay looking.About the music, we have nothing to say."
2,These boys are sexy,No I'm not gay but I musst say I have a sweet spot for these boys of Diba ! ! ! !
4,"Track or road, this is about the forces that apply","This book is all about the general theory behind suspension, frames, and tires. It provides a host of formulas complete with supporting graphics. Great stuff to impress your friends. What this book is not is a how-to manual for setting up a race bike, and/or resolving the likes or real world scenarios you would encounter on or off the track. The chapter on engines is mostly about vibrations, forces of rotations, and how they bolt into frames. The language conversion (Italian to English) is proper, but not smooth-often making it hard to determine if he's staying on the subject. If you want one book to learn the most from, buy Keith Cameron's Sport Bike Performance Handbook (ISBN076030229). If you have money left over, buy this one. However, this book would be a great (okay...excellent) gift item for anyone that rides street or track performance motos. By the way, it equally covers Italian, Japanese and German designs."
4,This is a book on physics as it relates to motorcycles,This is a good book if you want to read about the physics of motorcycles and the different technologies but it is not a design book. It has a lot of formulas (know your greek alphabet) but the math is simple. I found this book interesting but now I still need to find a book on design of motorcycles.
1,what about patter!,I was very disappointed that the detail was so theoretical and not much practical help in tuning a motorcycle chassis. In particular front wheel patter. A very common and reoccuring problem in racing motorcycles.
3,"Interesting book, with many imperfections","This book is very interesting because it helps understanding the physical behavior of a motorcycle. However it contains many errors and imperfections. E.g.: you can't introduce a formula without explaining the meaning of all the symbols or you cannot write ""a.tan"" instead of ""arctan"". If you need a more correct and scientific book, I recommend ""Cinematic & Dynamics of a Motorcycle"" by Vittore Cossalter, University of Padova. (http://pdmec4.mecc.unipd.it/~cos/DINAMOTO/indexmoto.html)."
4,Good if you really want the content,"* Quite Impressive paper and hard cover quality.* The right, comprehensive, well defined coverage introduction to design parameters of motorcycles(not so technological)* Good for display on bookshelves if laid back cover toward the wall.* Deficient count, detail and sense of realism in examples to demonstrate real world choices of variations in design parameters.* Arithmatic Formula representations are some what vague because they involves rather few numbers of factors.But a must-have if one have any additional interest in mechanical and dynamical understanding of bikes not only in riding. Just becareful that this book is focused not on repair and tuning but on the design and dynamics analysis on whole-general-motorcyle-domain coverage which may be misunderstood by the books cover picture(Aprilia RSV)."
5,AWESOME!,its easy to install;no problem with the seatbelt and other control of the seat..the back pocket is not covered by this seatcover..fits to my GMC car...
4,nice and sporty,"this seatcover is nice and sporty looking.the cushion doesn't flattened which is good for reducing a forward blind spot.the securing straps should have been constructed with a larger one so it won't slid and be still in place especially when getting off and on into it.otherwise, overall quality, construction and design of this seat is better if not best for its low price!!!wished there could be ""type S"" cover for my 40/60 split bench too!"
4,Great Seat Cover,I got this seat cover and am using it. I love it; i think the only thing that i would improve is the straps on the bottom so that it fits the chair a bit better. Very comfortable and sporty looking. Looking to see if they make a bench seat cover for the back of my Ford Escape.
2,Alex supplies disappointed me this time.,"Alex Art Supplies are usually awesome. I've never had anything but good experiences with their items before. I work at an art museum and the finger crayons and car crayon are favorites. I thought the face painting set would be just as great. I was greatly disappointed. The face paints don't go on, Even with some warm water and mixing, they aren't easy to apply, and the layer is very thin and opaque. The only decent thing about this set is the face painting crayons.I bought this set to face paint at a community festival, and ended up having to go to a Halloween store last minute to purchase an entirely different set of face paints. The difference between the two was astounding.If you are looking for a good, non-toxic, easy-to-apply face painting set, I would suggest buying a Snazaroo palette instead."
1,Stressful face paint set,"I agree with the other posters that this product was extremely difficult to use. I was to paint faces at the school carnival, and it was an unpleasant experience! The paints are thick and need just the right amount of water...there are no brushes in the set... the paint does not really transfer to the face. The crayons are ok, but also need a LOT of pressure. I'm sorry I bought this set and will not be keeping it."
1,terrible purchase,This was a complete waste. The paints simply didn't work. They are completely dry and didn't get better with water.Unfortunately I had purchased 3 sets for a school fair. I had to give all 3 away! and I felt bad even doing that because I knew they would never work. I switched to Snazaroo and Wolfe Brothers.
4,Panasonic Digital Phone and Answering Machine,"Am really happy with this product. Fantastic signal, easy to set up, does not interfere with my laptop signal. Am so glad I read the reviews and chose this product. For once I feel like I picked a winner on a cordless phone."
3,it's just OK,"My biggest complaint is the range on this phone. It is horrible. My old 997Megahtz phone I could practically go down the entire block and still hear just fine. Other than that, at times the voices sound as if there is an echo or something strange. It has some cool bells and whistles and looks fine but when it comes the basic functions - not the best!"
5,Works like a charm.,"Worth the money. Does what its supposed to do. Sound quality a bit low when used without the speakerphone, but the speakerphone is very audible."
4,"So far, so good ...","Upgraded my home office to this phone from a 2.4 GHZ Uniden phone that didn't have the range I wanted...if I walked into another room, that phone would get all static-y.I've had this phone for a week, and so far it's been great. My 11-year-old son helped me set up and program the phones ... quite easy, once you read the manual. My 9-year-old daughter likes to use them for intercom purposes.Best of all, the ""giga-range"" technology makes the call crystal clear ... no matter where I am in the house. I've taken calls from client from all over the U.S. and I've been able to move around as I need to without giving up call quality.The only downside I can see so far is that they do not come with a belt clip (even my daughter pointed out this flaw). Not good for when I'm moving around the house.But so far, given the excellent phone quality, I can live without a belt clip."
1,Static phones,"This product was the poorest product I have received from Panasonic. Nothing but static, no matter what I did. Voices from the receiving end sounded as if they were very far away."
5,excellent purchase,"It was an excellent purchace, combining best quality with best price. The procedure of posting the item was so fast -it was arrived 2-3 days earlier- IT WAS A REAL EXCELLENT SERVICE-"
5,Great Cordless phones,"This is a great cordless phone with a tremendous distance range. Easy to use, long battery life and good reliable sound. It arrived promptly and exactly as advertised."
1,DO NOT recommend buying from Globazar!,"I ordered expecting a NEW Panasonic KX-TG632M from Globazar as it was stated as ""NEW"" on the Amazon link. However, they sent me a refurbished model! Read the fine print under Globazar and they state they sell new and REFURBISHED goods. I was quite disappointed and asked whether I can return my merchandise. They still have not responded to my email after 5 days."
2,Lot of problems,"Normally I really like Panasonic phones, (especially after a horrible experience with V Tech) but this one has a lot of problems.First off, if you are like myself and use Vonage or another VOIP service and don't want or need the built in answering machine, the light up indicator will not work.Secondly, call quality through the headset jack leaves much to be desired and finally:No light up keypad, this one is on it's way back"
3,good phone- have grown used to it...,"phone handsets have good sound and operations, but there is no excuse in today's times not to support showing that your voice mail with your phone company service plan has a message waiting!this phone's manual says it does not support this. when someone is on the line and chooses not to use call waiting to answer the other call, having voice mail from your phone company means someone can still leave you a message.this couldnt have cost much more to manufacture into this phone. it must just be poor design and planning!update: have grown used to this and like this phone. gives different intermittent dial tone with extgernal voice mail message is waiting. would bump this rating up to 4 stars..."
2,didn't like this item,the keys were to close together and there was no speaker on the base. i returned it.
5,Perfect,Great Item. Got it in little more than 5 days (although I opted for 3-5 days shipping) but is a fantastic item qin quality of the sound. Little too costly compared to other brands but hmm..its Panasonic right.
2,very loud click when handset activates/deactivates,"I haven't seen this reported yet... I use a headset 99% of the time with the KX-TG5632 so this problem is critical for those of you using headsets. The problem is a very loud click when the handset activates or deactivates its power saving mode, e.g. when you first press the Talk button or when it goes quiescent after about 10 seconds of non-use. It happens on both my handsets. It doesn't happen on my KX-TG5432. It's annoying enough that I will have to look for another phone, perhaps an older KX-TG5432 if I can find one."
1,Don't Buy this Phone,"I purchased a Panasonic KX-TGAS510M two years and after a year, one of the handsets started loosing its power very quickly and then stopped working. Also, the batteries in these phones have extremely short life and you have to change them once every four to six months.There is an ongoing class action lawsuit against panasonic for the series KXTG and KXTC phones."
2,defective handsets,"Defective handsets:After 5 minutes of use, the handset starts beeping and fades away, especially my voice to the other party as well as his. I increase the volume according to the instruction. But this process continues and I have to switch to the old cord-telephone. The batteries were fully charged at the beginning of each use, on top of the 24 hour charging at the time of installation."
5,Panasonic Dual Phone Answering Machine,This cordless phone works great! We'd had other phones that picked up other conversations or static but this one doesn't. It has different rings to pick from and the antenna will light up when it rings-which is great if you have children that are sleeping!! We liked ours so well that we bought this for my husbands parents and they are very happy with theirs too!!
4,very good... great for the price!!,"I needed to upgrade to a 5.8 GHz phone, because my 2.4 GHz kept knocking me off my computer wireless network. This one did the trick. Good phone with good range. Answering system works great. Only reason not to give it a 5? When you scroll through the incoming call log, if it's a call from a cellphone it will often say ""wireless caller"" and you have to wait for a couple seconds for it to display the phone number. So if you're scrolling through quickly to find a number to call, you have to often stop and wait for it to show you the number. I'm too impatient for that !!"
4,Excellent phone but missing some functions,"Over all this phone works well with my Vonage. The sounds quality is excellent, and I like the ring tones.I only give this product 4 stars due to several functions of the phone:1. The phone book you added in 1 phone, does not automatically registered in the other phone. You will have to 'send' your phone book to the other phone.2. You have to 'clean' the list of incoming calls (from the caller id) in both phones. There is no function to delete it from 1 phone and applied to the other phone. My old v-tech could do this, and it really helps when you have over 30+ calls a day.3. Related to point #2 above, if you answer call with phone #1, phone #2 will said you 'missed' that call."
5,Love this phone,"This was my first cordless phone and it is the best piece of tech i have bought in years. I love the caller ID, the built in phone book, phone locator, speaker phone. You can give callers not only a ring tone but the color on antenna can be set to red, green or yellow, or a combo of all of them to Id a caller.This phone has made my life so much easier as i never answer calls i dont know and can see who has called me while i was out.The range is excellent as well, as i have taken phone all the way out to my car on street and signal was still perfect. Battery life is excellent as well.I have now had this phone six months with no problems."
1,Could you speak up please?,"I soooo want to like this phone! I love the way it looks, I like the features, and I'm digging the three color light up antenna, and yet, sadly, I CAN'T HEAR ANY CALLERS!!!! Voice enhancer is a joke, it makes it sound even worse. I just cannot in good conscience recommend this phone ( unless your hearing is really, really, really good!) One more thing to add, this is my second Panasonic phone and I had the same issues with the last one. I won't be buying a third Panasonic."
3,Initial problems= satisfied customer,"I was very upset when I opened my order and it was the wrong phone and it didn't even work, but when I called the customer service line, my fears were put to rest. I spoke with Shragy, who made everything good again. He sent me a new phone and gave me a percentage off my bill and seemed legitimately concerned. He apologized for the mistake in shipping and took care of it in a prompt manner. Thanks Shragy!"
5,Panasonic or nothing.,"If you're going to buy a phone, don't waste your time with trial and error, reviews, etc. Reviews are only partially helpful anyway, including this one. Panasonic's best product is their phones. Range is all that one need be concerned with. If a phone has good range, it has good battery life, good clarity, low interference, and Panasonic's name on it."
5,great phone easy to set up,This is my second Panasonic phone. I was looking for something a bit smaller than the previous one I had and this one is a great size. This phone takes up very little space on my counter and the second handset takes up even less space. It was easy to set up the range is great and the speaker phone is quite good. I would purchase this phone again.
4,EXELENTE !!!,"PROSMuy buen producto, comunicación clara, exelente diseñoCONTRASNo se puede alejar más de 50 mts de la base"
3,"Good Phone, but why the LOW VOLUME??","This phone offers a lot of features for the money, and seems to be performing pretty good. Having the two handsets with only the base needing hooked up to a phone line is handy. The handsets are small and light, but not too small to where they are clumsy to handle.So why just three stars? Let me whisper it to you - low speaker volume on the handsets. I have the handset volume at the maximum setting, and it is still quiet. If you get someone with bad reception, talks lightly, or just doesn't feel like speaking into their handset - forget it. I am confused as to why Panasonic would not let you turn the speaker up higher. If you are even slightly hearing impared, or are thinking about this phone as a purchase for an older person - don't. They won't hear a word you say when you call them.Three star phone that could have easily been a five star phone. A ""nice"" phone with great features isn't worth anything if it doesn't perform its primary function properly."
4,Panasonic Dual Handset Answering System,"The answering system is very un-complex and easy to use. The voice quality is excellent (I bought it in the first place because our previous system changed the sound of people's voices). Synchronizing the two handsets is also easy and convenient. The one feature that could have made this phone better would have been a brighter light on the handset or a larger font size (or both). Particularly when I need to scroll down the contact list, I often have to move closer to a window or put on a pair of reading glasses to read the text on the display."
2,Looks Great but Works Poorly,"I took my time decided between my options but knew that I wanted voice mail within the phone and because it would be in plain view of my customers, I need it to look sharp. This phone certainly qualifies on those two counts but I hadn't considered that I could purchase a phone, any phone, that was this quiet.Calling to set up gas, water and electric, my ear and side of head hurt from pressing the phone hard against my ear to hear. (And this coming from an amateur boxer.) I kept checking that the volume was all the way up and it was. And would switch 'VE' Voice Enhancement from on to off. 'VE' would change the tone and was a marginally improvement, but nowhere near what I needed.I should also note that the phone I had in the shop for the first 2 days, while hideously ugly and old with some buttons that you'd have to mash to get to work, was loud and clear.This Panasonic goes back today!"
4,One of the Best,"This Panasonic set has good clarity, volume and features. Definitely one of the best. The only down side is a brief voice activated lag when talking on speaker phone."
5,Faultless,"I bought this item after buying a similar product from Panasonicwith a fax. This one was much better quality. Good sound quality, good range for the second handset. The station is small and neat and it was so easy to set up and use. I can't fault this item. Good value and great quality."
4,Very good,"I'm using this product in Brazil. I can not use all its features because the differences between countries, but it's a very useful product and I liked so much its design, colors and easy-of-use."
5,Just what was needed,Received on time and just what was ordered. Thanks it was needed by a child in high school who needed it for her class.
4,No Doctor Who?,"This dictionary is amazing, and I marvel at the amount of work that went into making it.However, I bought this dictionary in the hopes that who was in it, or ""the Doctor"" or something of that sort. I'm working on a definition paper and ""the Doctor"" is my topic, and I need a specialized dictionary in which I got my definition. I found no such mention of Doctor Who, though I have yet to read the entire thing. Is Doctor Who mentioned in this at all? Please, help would be appreciated."
4,Looks great on Blu Ray,"The movie itself was good, better than the two sequels in my opinion. But the real reason I bought the film was because it was on blu ray, and it did not dissapoint. The cars looked amazing, as did the special effects. The special features were ok but nothing really great, the ""mash up"" feature was kind of neat to play with. For those who don't know mash up is mixing clips and sound from the movie in a order you like. You are basically making your own commercial. All in all this was a good buy, I just ordered Fast and Furious, hopefully it's just as good."
3,Just an OK movie,"The movie was full of high speed action, the plot was so-so and the acting was horrendous. Probably a product of targeting only the cool, sexy young actors.Nevertheless, this movie introduced us to the growing popularity of the street racing scene and was very shallowy entertaining (3 stars)."
5,DTS makes this worth owning,"This happens to be the first dvd that made my wife exclaim loudy, ""Wow, that sounds great!!!"" Considering she never understood why i spent so much money on my surround sound system untill this dvd says a lot.Plot wise it's weak but who cares!!! Visually it's not much different than most dvd's but the action is almost non-stop.If you have a DTS decoder i would recommend this dvd as THE benchmark dvd for showcasing your DTS system."
1,THIS MOVIE ....!,"Even hot women and fast cars could not save the horrible acting and stupid plot of this movie. After watching, all I could do is sit and think that I had just wasted one hour and forty-seven minutes of my life! This movie was bank rolled buy the ""bolt-on"" car parts world! Bolt on a turbo to your moms honda and race tomorrow! If he has a nine second car in the shed why does he spend all the money to build the other one!?!?!"
2,Point Break with Expensive Toys,The plot is a blatant rip-off of Point Break. At least it has some good car scenes though.
5,Vroom-vroom!!,"Despite a lot of criticism that I have heard from friends and co-workers, I really enjoyed the movie. I've never seen a movie so dedicated toward fast cars, especially imports. I have a deep passion for cars and it's a breath of fresh air to see a movie that was able to best represent car enthusiasts' pride and joy, their car. I realize they operated on a tight budget for the movie but despite that they managed well and produced an action packed thriller that anyone who has nitrous and gasoline flowing through their veins would enjoy!"
3,IT's SO COOL!,"This movie is just cool.Really cool. I mean so cool. It's the best ""cheap thrill"" I've seen in a number of years. The plot is irrelevant because there is none; characters are highlighted with only a couple of characteristics, and the movie lacks any substance whatsoever. So what? Really, who went to see this picture thinking that he would be learning about the danger of drunk-driving or the risk driving a race car? I went to see it while tired, and I got out hyper-ventilating. It's fun, light and so cool. It plays like a music video, a really good one. And it's essential that we remember that, because that was the movie's whole basis. And the effects and the races work so well.Go see this film when you don't want to work your brain too hard...Enjoy"
5,WOW!! A MUST-SEE!!,"This is definitly my favorite movie! It is action packed and has a little humor in it as well. If you are into cars, then this movie is like heaven for you.This movie is basically based on trust and illegal street-racing. The technology in these cars are unbelieveable, and the stunts that are performed are mind-boggling.I have never seen so much ""interesting"" action in one scene in my life. I saw this movie twice in the theaters, and I bought the DVD the first day.Some of these cars would be anyone's dream car, but each car gets better than the previous. Whether it's the Green Eclipse or the Honda Civics.This movie is about an undercover cop who joins a racing team in order to find out who has been robbing tractor-trailers for their electronics...Overall, the plot is a 3 but the action/special effects are a 5+. The cars in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen in my life. I think that this movie is more for the younger crowd, it appeals to us more than adults."
4,B movie without the T & A,"Why do we watch ""B"" movies? T & A, right? Well they replaced the T & A with cars in this movie. I am not into the Japanese four banger hot rods. I am an American Muscle Car fanatic. This movie changed some of my views. The cars in the movie are just plain pretty (especially the one and only Muscle Car, a blown 1968-69 Dodge Charger). I had no idea the kind of power these cars could produce. Granted, the acting left something to be desired. It was bearable, however. This was an ideal example of a ""B"" movie, right down to the Cheesy on liners ('I live my of a quarter of a mile at a time'). Your proverbial ""naked women"" have been replaced with a lot of really nice (expensive) cars. The plot is simple to follow. I rated this movie as high as I did because of what it is. It is a great ""B"" movie."
4,The only chick-review,"From probably the only female reviewing this movie, and a female who can't stand action flicks... if Vin tickles your senses, you'll dig this movie. Sure the cars are fun, it's loaded with testosterone, and you are glad that justice is served against the 'bad guys' in the end, but most important: It serves up plenty of eye candy. There is one (too brief) scene between Vin and his gal that offers enough to keep your own imagination going for awhile. Plot? Is there EVER REALLY a GOOD plot in an action movie? Do we really care about the fact that we never get back to Road Wars or whether someone is racing with a laptop on the passenger seat? We're not looking for reality- and I think I speak for both the boys and girls on this one. Really now... please. (And girls, if you are looking for more Vin, check out XXX.)"
1,"Bright lights, fancy vehicles, 0 believability","this is the epitome of the movies I hate. Essentially plotless, unless you consider car chase plot, this is a hour and a half long commercial for sport tuning your car. The story line is completely un-believable, the characters are un-believable, and the ONLY saving grace of this movie is that it's got ""pretty cars"" and ""bright lights."""
3,For the Adrenaline Rush Only.,"Okay, you should know this isn't going to be Hamlet; or Chinatown or Citizen Kane or whatever. This is going to be simple adrenal kickay action about hot cars & hot chicks and that's about it! On that level, this does not disappoint.So, you get a BS story with some lightly sketched characters in a hyper-kinetic flick (do they make any other kind anymore?); directed & edited with the expected high energy and razzle dazzle techniques; some excellent stunt work done with some super hot cars driven by young hunks and babes.As he proved in Pitch Black, Vin Diesel is a real screen presence; and hot cars, illegal drag races, and young studs & their honeys are as American as Apple Pie and Rebel Without a Cause. Fast, simple, and dumb...it's about the jolt, man! Taken at that, s'okay."
3,Good but definatly not the best. point break with cars,"The fast and the furious was really a good movie, but I couldnt shake the feeling like I've been here before. Point Break anyone? The movie was completely based on Point Break, only with cars instead of surfing. Included were an undercover cop who falls in with the guys he thinks are innocent but who turn out to be the guys who are robbing semis (you know, instead of banks) then he falls in love with the one girl that he shouldnt all the while the feds order an assult on the guys he thinks are the ones who are the real crooks but they arn't. But I wont lie. TFATF was a really entertaining movie. I wouldn't quite say it was better than Gone in 60 Seconds, but it was good none the less and I would recomend it to any Gran Tourismo fan or any true action movie fan. I also plan on buying the DVD when it's released. But beware....If you have seen Point Break, you've seen TFATF. Don't say I didn't warn you......"
1,The rings of Saturn aren't a big enough Zero for this poop.,"Awful, Awful, Awful. This film could have been great & I thought it would be based on some interesting reviews. But what a joke!The actors(?!) can't act, the script was absolutely terrible..who affects speech like this? So embarassing to hear white people mimic urban black street speech. I cringed! Unintentional rascism? The only intelligent person, or I should say the only character who was portrayed as being intelligent(the computer/engineer geek who of course dies) has a learning disability! WHAT!The cars are the stars of the film. The desire to see the cars is the real lure here. Not once does the director focus the camera on them and them alone. They missed the whole web of fantasies assosciated with car culture.And the music was so scouse, so low-budget. A wasted oppurtunity on every level."
1,Mindless and Disgusting...,"If this movie reflects the current state of our society, it is a sad day, indeed. Aside from the offensive language and dress, there was absolutely no plot to speak of. I can't believe this movie is only rated PG-13. ..."
1,The Unoriginal and the Boring,Are there any people who are not boys under the age of 14 writing good reviews for this movie??Nope? Didn't think so!'nuff said
1,WORST MOVIE. MADE FOR KIDS.,"This movie is plain terrible.Anybody ever seen Point Break, this movie is a copy. They just use a different instrument. In Point Break it was surfers and here it's F and F its cheap cars. eclipse's and civic's? lol. Comon guys. The acting sucks!!! How can you say this movie was good. Pearl Harbor was even better then this. I've seen every movie since back in the day, and wow this one is def. in the bottom 10 worst"
4,A Good Action Movie,"I've seen better action/suspense movies, but this is still very good. If you like cars of any sort, it's for you. Paul Walker plays a great role, as well as Vin Diesel. However, kids ages nine and down shouldn't see it, with the exception of a few parts. I wouldn't exactly rush to see it, but you should watch it whenever you can."
5,Best movie ever!,"This is the best movie ever!!!! The whole movie, you are on the edge of your seat waiting for the next spectacular event to happen. This is one thriller you dont wanna miss out on! All nascar and racing fans, this is the movie for you!"
1,Vrrrrrooooooommmmzzzzzzzz--poppupupupzzzzzzz...pah!,"Besides great lookin cars, and interesting,uh, uh, nevermind. This was one of the silliest movies EVER. What the heck? Cars do not go that fast , nitro or not. And the plot was like a stew sitting in the fridge for weeks without being touched.Vin Diesel is a good actor, yet here it's just a cashbag to do. Paul Walker is the only sharp act here in the flick. Not bad.And the fact that after seeing this flick, street racing went up 200%...well, proves that this is a movie not to make if you dont want to be a bad influence.Vroooom-pah-puff-putzzzzzzz....."
1,Style Over Substance,"You know something I notice with movies directed by Rob Cohen that have Vin Diesel in them? NONE of them have real plots in them; they are all more of crowd pleasers. This is no exception. If you like visuals, you will love this movie. But if you are looking for some actual good action movies, I suggest you look elsewhere (lots of recommended titles that I'd rather not list). Really, I found it hard to just keep on watching this because there's nothing that made me think ""Wow!"" when I was amazed, except that so many people actually wanted to see this. Although I don't necessarily recommend it either, XXX also is quite lame and is more about seeing the explosion than an actual coherent story. I don't think I'd want to shell out money for this.On the good side, ""Sin City"" just came out a couple days ago."
3,Good action.......Not accurate,"This movie was obviously made by people who truly do not know the import scene. Yes i know the director asked some people in the import scene to give his insight, but he obviously didn't do alot of it. First off, how come all the main cars in the movie are all painted. The real import scene does not do that, they keep it clean. And now CRX or 88-91 Civics? That's a joke.If you just want to see some fast cars and good action, this movie is pretty good. But if you want to get an accurate interpretation of the import scene, you are in for a bad surprise."
3,Agree with Amazon Review,"I agree with the Amazon reviews that said this was a guilty pleasure. While I wasn't interested in any way watching ""hot women"", the hot and fast action of high power muscle cars and street racing has some merit. Pure enjoyment and knowledge that this is a movie, not reality.Also... agreement with another reviewer - all my stars go to the racing sequences. They are heart pumping and great to watch. While not Oscar material and not a movie to develop solid positive role models, definitely good to see if you're in that kind of mood."
5,LOOKING GOOD,Everything in this movie is looking good. The men and the cars. This action packed movie will keep you entertained. If you haven't seen this movie by now you don't know what you are missing.
2,"Been there, Done that ...","I liked this movie better when it had Keanu Reeves and was called 'Point Break'...Now that I got that rip out of my system I can be a little more objective. Not a bad movie, all the performances are well done and the action scenes are a lot of fun. However, it's not exactly breaking any new ground either.I'm really not sure I'd spring twenty bucks to buy a copy, but it's definitely something I'd make it a point to see at some point."
5,Diesel Magic,"This was clearly a star vehicle for Vin Diesel. While the rest of the cast's work is just fine, the idea that Paul Walker is the center of this film is, well, ridiculous. Without question, Diesel steals the show and is the magnetic core of the movie. It could have been just another action/racing flick, but Diesel adds a depth and charm to the character of Dom that you wouldn't expect. Truly a fun film....and great for Diesel drooling. He's a serious actor, but man is he s-e-x-y too, ladies. Real star power. He'll be around for long time."
4,awesome! heart pumping action!!,this movie all around was awsome one off the best movies I've ever seen one set back is the main chics in it are not all that hot and the smaller character hotties you dont see more than once or twice.ON the other hand had sweet heart cars that would blow you mind like the black charger with a 900 horsepower engine. Its a must see movie
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!,"This movie is so cool i recommend it to everyone i saw it in theaters 5 times it is worth whatever price you have to pay, I love the combonation of sweet cars and hot women, and the semi gang wars going on in between. BUY THIS MOVIE!"
5,AWSOME!,"If you loved Gone in 60 Seconds, this will knock your socks off. I can't say enough about this movie. Must see ASAP. Fast cars. Awsome camera shots. Fast action. Everyone and anyone will love this movie."
4,Good Movie For Car Fanatics,"The Fast and the Furious is a good movie for those who like fast cars, and a lot of action. The plot is easy to follow and isn't the greatest but stays funny and action packed consistantly. It's mainly a movie with fast cars, and hot women. If your not into that then I suggest you dont buy this movie."
3,"Good Adrenaline Rush, But That's All","This movie is great mindless entertainment, the guys are hot, and so are the girls, the cars and chases are cool. It'll make you start looking around town for tricked out cars all night long after you see it. Not much plot or significant character development (""I live my life 1/4 mile at a time"") but it definitely gets the blood pumping."
1,Ugh... Eeek... Yuck....,"What can I say? I was sick and my girlfriend decided she'd rent a movie for us to watch. So, she comes back with this.In short: bad plot, bad dialog, bad movie.In slightly: This is a movie for kids who take their car and add a 4"" diameter exhaust to it so that they look 'cool'. Lots of loud noises, a soundtrack filled with Limp Bizkit-wannabes, and not much else. There isn't even much racing in this movie, and those that are are over so quickly they're just boring.There's scenes that make no sense (what's with the cut to Vin Diesel and his girl during the police raid? it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie), it ends unfinished (you spend all that time developping a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens?)It just sucks, but there's no accounting for taste."
2,"Good depiction of So.Cal car scene, not much else","If you are into Asian hot rods (lots of new tricked out Mitsubishis and Hondas) this is the movie for you. However, if you are expecting to see tight old school cars...there are TWO in this whole film. Since I am orignally from Southern California, I could relate to the teen scene and street racing in industrial areas that are depicted in this movie. My friends here in Oakland (Northern California) were very disappointed with this film because they expected to see some nice old school cars. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, and the script is so predictable that I laughed out loud at times."
5,Way better than you'd expect from the title,"A great action movie -- the fast-paced plot and amazing visuals draw you in whether you like it or not. If you know little about cars and nothing about racing them, this can be even educational. Despite the old ""love vs. loyalty"" theme, the story has enough unpredictable moments to keep the tension till the very end. The film has a lot of half-naked women, but it's not as sexist as most of its kind, and the number of hot guys showing off their goods makes it an even trade. The cars are beautiful, the stunts are outstanding, and the actors are way more than the standard-issue action props. If you gonna see just one summer movie this year, see this one."
2,Movie was [bad]!!,"The movie was good and the cars were [bad]. Wait, I got that backward. The movie was bad and the cars were sweet. The acting is aweful. Seriously, the only reason why I bought it is for the cars. I even ripped it to vcd and deleted all the ""acting"" I parts so all I had was the racing. It makes a great movie."
4,Vin Diesel rocks this show,"Nothing says the Big Show like Vin Diesel blasting down the highway over a 100 mph. I enjoyed watching Vin (Dom, character he plays) race in the coolest cars you ever want to see. Dom was a fighter until the end. He got busted up but it was worth the fast pounding action and roar of the engines. I only took off one star because Paul Walker kept getting in the way.Watch this movie for a speedracing rush and a quick shot of Vin on high Diesel."
3,Fast pace and Vin Diesel,"They go hand in hand don't they. So do you really need to read the review of a movie that has Vin Diesel. Story...[...]...But what Vin Diesel brings to a movie is the next action star hype. This movie is incredibly fast paced. From the opening scence which shows Paul Walker as Brian O' Connor speeding down the road in his suped up street car turned race car. Although it supposedly gives us a line into the underground racing world, it's still a little hard to swallow.But like I said there is action and lot's of it. The DVD is cool because it explains that they actually used some of the underground racing community to fill in as extra's. The Special deleted scenes are pretty good, and it shows several different camera angles for the truck scene at the end, which is pretty intense.I wouldn't buy the DVD if I could go back and change my decision, but it is definatley worth renting and watching if for nothing else than the special effects."
3,i feel sorry for you people,"you talk about these built engines and these fast race scenes, i can tell you that they picked those cars by what body kits were on them. the cars had sparco seats because sparco paid to have their name in the movie same with all of the cars having NOS kits, not all racers run NOS if thats what you thought after that movie, the white jetta was a wings west project car, it has a body kit wheels and exhaust and is actually slow as hell. in the drag race scene they were going 35 miles an hour then they sped up the film. wow real fast. it was a good movie im not saying i didnt like it. i will just say that the people in the industry were pretty upset in the way the cars were picked, ... and wheres the german love, 1 german car, common. they are already filming a fast and the furious 2, i will be one of the first to go see it, but not so much for the movie but for the gathering of everyone in the import scene in the parking lot of the theater-GrinGo"
5,Awesome go fast movie,"We went to a sneak preview of this movie and I can tell you that, if you love cars, you need to be there on opening day. This movie is awesome! It has super-slick tuner cars, hot dudes and cool chicks. A must-see for those involved in the sport compact scene and car lovers in general."
2,Point Break: Part 2 ...,"This movie must be ment as a joke ! It is nothing but a second class copy of Point Break ! If you are hooked on fast cars, this movie might be ""OK"".But as an action movie, it does not even come close to Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze's original !"
1,Why does Hollywood hate us?,"Crap! I blame this movie entirely for the rage of driving cars with Chinese symbols painted on the doors with lawnmower-sounding exhausts. A creation of Satan both actor and plot wise. Michelle Rodriguez is an attention retainer, but that aside, Paul Walker should ""Walk"" himself into on coming traffic. Complete moron."
2,All shinny and no back-bone.,"From the first time I seen this movie I noticed something, it was a movie that was about a bunch of really nice cars and not much of a story plot. I thought the movie was good but I am the time that looks for a good story plot. If you are one of those people that like a good plot this is not the movie for you. If you just like the cover of the book and not what is in it, then this movie is for you. I would recommend renting it before even thinking about buying this movie."
1,Cheap thrills,"I feel that nearly everyone that's rating this movie are giving it extremely high marks. Give me a break people, let's all take a step back from the ""cool"" cars and hot women (there wasn't very many) and see this movie for what it really is. . . A cheap, temporary form of entertainment. Face it, in a few, few years anyone who buys this movie is going to end up giving it away or forgetting about (I know I did with ID4). Also, I have to agree with the other viewer that rated this movie with one star--a complete Point Break rip-off. If you really want to see this movie, either rent it or borrow it from a friend, but for- the-love-of-all-things-sacred don't actually buy it."
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!!,"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST RACING MOVIE EVER MADE!!!! WHO EVER WROTE THIS MOVIE HAS NO CLUE ABOUT CARS OR ENGINES!!! FOR EXAMPLE.....WHEN THE CAR IS ABOUT TO BLOW UP BECAUSE THE GANGSTERS SHOT IT,EVERYONE SCREAMS NOSSSSS(NITROUS OXIDE)AND THE CAR EXPLODES!!!! TOO BAD NITROUS ISNT FLAMMABLE,ITS AN OXIDIZER!!!STUPID!!!WHEN PAUL WALKER IS RACING IN THE FIRST RACE HE HITS THE NOS AND THE FLOOR BOARD FALLS OUT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE.....HOW WOULD THAT HAPPEN!!!!HE HAS LIKE A 5 STAGE NITROUS SET UP AND EVERYTIME HE HITS THE NOS THE CAR BURNS OUT AGAIN WHILE HES DOING OVER 100 MPH!!!! COME ON....AND NOW ME AND THE MAD SCIENTIST HAVE TO TEAR APART THE ENGINE CAUSE YOU FRIED THE PISTON RINGS....WHAT A JOKE!!!"
5,The first and best import movie every......,"The trailer look good, the cars and females look good too. I enjoy the cast : Vin, Paul, Michelle, Jordana, Rick, and Ja Rule, they all are good actor and actress.I like the story line to the movies, it just make me wanna see it more.They should've hired me as one of the driver in the movies, I have a high preformance car and i can drive as well. Im gonna go see the movie 2 times."
3,a ok car movie,i love this movie it is a a a a i cant tell you in words . i think this is a good movie but it has worst skirp like quites like (i live my life a 2/4 mile at a time that [...]. but i love cars a nisson going 140 mph is year going event but you can say that i am a litte tuff on movies. i was dissapointed on this movie i tought it was going to be more fun but if is boring un tell you see cars going 1400 down down town l.a its ok. bottem line it iis a fast movie buy it on vhs and fast over the dumm parts!!!!!!!
5,Two of the hottest actors on screen.,"This movie was awesome! Vin is hot and sexy. I found myself irresistibly drawn to Vin and Paul. Paul went from cute in ""Varsity Blues"" to whoa! in this flick. And Vin, he's just damn sexy!"
5,the awesomest movie,I think this movie rocks the house. Vin diseal rocks and paul walker does also. Get the movie
2,The Dumb and the Dumbious,"Wow. Who writes the dialogue for this stuff. I'mnearly in a coma and I could throw better wordstogether.Anyway, hey I expected a B movie so I shouldn'tcomplain. It's a great movie to make fun of. Bad acting,bad plot, bad script and standard action. In a ridiculous early scene,this group of racing knuckleheads with their little midget cars that sound like bees, seemingly thousands of them, take over half the city of L.A. to hang out and say stupid things, act cool and gawk at each other. Not one cop in sight? A race takes place between Vin Unleaded and Paul Walker that's seems very unrealistic and cartoonish. I wasn't impressed or entertained by the editing, camerawork or action. Seen it all before big deal.I got a very 80s feel from this movie. And I don't want to feel 80s anymore. Towards the end the action picked up a bit and things got more interesting, but all in all this movie stunk. As I expected. So all is well."
5,BUY THIS MOVIE-- SUPRA'S RULE 650-900HP,This movie is great if you like cars and girls. There are alot of people that think bigger is better. Well there just wrong. The people that think mustangs are good don't understand this movie. Everyone needs this in there dvd collection.
5,THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS,The Fast and the Furious is easily pushin for the best of just about any modern movie. Some of the cars in their are about as pimp as pimp can get. I think Van Diesel played a sweet role in the movie and was pretty damn hardcore. I thought the Toyota Supra was one of the sweetest cars I have ever seen. After I saw the movie I had total different approach on driving. I cant wait for it to come out on DVD. The girls were lookin pretty fine in the movie too so i guess over all in the package deal it was just a 5 star movie any way you look at it. If all Van Diesels movies are that good hes gonna have a heck of a career.
2,Chick flick with hot chicks.,"The dialogue is horrible, the acting is poor, and the technical flaws are amazing. The most irritating thing about this movie is it tries to elevate some of the slowest cars on the roads today to not only sportscars, but supercars. The Honda Civic? Please. I love the old Charger, but 900hp? And it still can't beat the Civic?! The movie also features floorboards that fly off when the engine is under stress, engines that heal themselves after blowing, and special effects that make 140mph look like the sound barier. The movie is not without its perks, though, as it was entertaining. Good looking women are the best feature of the movie, which is ironic because more women will enjoy this movie than car-knowledgable dudes."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An unapologetically dumb movie, The Fast and the Furious offers a lot of eye-candy (from pretty boys and girls to high-speed chases) and little more, but that's not so bad, is it?"
3,"Better than 3 stars, not good enough for 4...","Surprisingly, I enjoyed this film. I really wasn't looking forward to paying $8 to see yet ANOTHER testosterone-filled racing movie (and I actually like most ""guy"" flicks), but it was a night away from home with my friends, so I figured why not! Although the plot wasn't too original, it wasn't too weak, either, and the some of the characters were quite marvelous.For a more picky critic, who seems to want to get the best movie experience ever, every time he or she goes to the cinema, this movie will probably get a bad rap. It's not really as bad, however, as the critics led the general public, to believe. Vin Deisel and Paul Walker have a great chemistry together, a real challenging atmosphere. Very cool.Worth a watch."
5,The Best,"When I watched this movie I thought it was just going to be about cars and how they look when they are hooked up, but when I watched it I noticed it wasn't all just about cars but it had a good meaning behind it. It's about friendships that people make and how strong they can get in such a short amount of time ( the cars are just a bonus). This movie had such a good plot behind it, with everything from cars to friendships to love and understanding. I think this movie is worth 5 stars because it touches apon important things like -friendship -love -trust -family -understanding and forgivness. That is why I loved this movie. There is nothing they could change to make this a better movie. The cars where also perfect!"
3,The Fast and the Furious,"Great action. Worth getting simply because of the cars and driving expierence. Plot is decent, acting and script need work but who cares. That's not why you are buying this movie. A movie meant for entertainment and that is exactly what it does."
2,The Slow and the Coulda Been Better,"I viewed this film expecting spectacular motor stunts and a great Days of Thunder type plotline involving cops and robbers. What I got was the unexpected. The plot basically drags out Paul Walker's character wrestling with the fact of whether or not he wants to turn Vin Diesel in. The action sequences themselves are reminiscent of something you would see in one of those B movies you see coming on late night HBO and are released direct-to-video. Walker himself has potential (he stole the show in 1999's She's All That) but he was woefully miscast in this role. I see potential in Vin Diesel, too, but the movie relied on viisual spectacle more than characters and plot development. The soundtrack is pretty decent, if you're a fan of air guitar nonsense. The female leads aren't as appealing as you would expect then to be in this type of film."
2,Um.... what?,"Apparently, I've developed a penchant for stink-bomb movies. This latest one, The Fast and the Furious, may have set the weekly low. Like, almost (but not quite) as bad as Mission to Mars. Anyway, between dialogue that makes no sense and vague gearhead references that probably aren't even accurate, my favorite scene is where they're going after a team of inner city hijackers for stealing $1,200,000 in... DVD players. Now, the average retail of a DVD player is about $150. That means that the team of hijackers has apparently stolen and fenced about 8,000 DVD players. Hmmm... Sounds like a lot of work. Perhaps they should switch to selling drugs. Anyway, stay away from this one... although the ultra-testosterone laden storyline is good for a laugh."
4,"GOOD,BUT NOT GREAT...","The Fast and The Furious is a hot, action (car racing) film which combines fast street car racing and hot women. The plot I did not quite understand and wasn't that clearly developed. Brian, an undercover cop in L.A. races as one of the street racers t and tries to see if the gang of racers have stolen car engines and other car supplies from hijacked trucks. The racing is hot, the women are hot, the acting not terribly great but ok. This is mainly a movie for teens and young adults, I don't think many older folks would like this flick."
4,Awesome movie,I really like this movie. I put it on when I don't feel like thinking and just want to be entertained.
4,Diesel fuels and Walker lays down the law,great action movie with some nice car racing and stunts. Diesel fuels up the screen with his part and Walker lays the law down with his undercover cop role. both do extremely well. Ja Rule makes his acting debut and he is great. the sequel I recommend for fans but im a fan and the second one was lame
4,Better than Gone In 60 Seconds,"I bought this movie knowing the comparissions between Gone In 60 Seconds but I think that this one is better.The plot and the action secuences are better by fast.A good choice.Regards,David."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I never thought that this movie would be this good. I must confess that I rented it strickly based on the previews of the awesome Dodge Charger that was in the previews. As the movie pulled me in I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually a good move. Kind of a cross between American Grafitti, Top Gun and the Shriley Muldowny story, lol.This is a fascinating, action packed, racing movie about the generation of street racers that are around today. Similar do the older generations drag strips to a point. Intertwined with the street racing was an undercover, good cop helping the ""good"" bad buy type of script. The ""betrayal"" of the good girl ect.Overall, a very good movie with fast cars, girls and guns. More of a guy movie overall but could be enjoyed by guys and gals.Very good flick, give it a look!"
2,Not that great of a movie...,"This movie really didn't impress me. It wasn't really any different from any other movies of this type, though it was better than Gone in Sixty Seconds. This movie lacked just about everything that I was expecting from it...although it did have alot of very nice cars and some really great, realistic looking action sequences. I must give credit where credit is due. The acting wasn't too great...Paul Walker was very bad, however Vin Diesel makes up for Walker's bad acting. I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone...but it's nothing too horrible."
5,More adrenaline than bungee jumping.,"""The Fast and the Furious"" had you on the edge of your seat. There was adreanaline pumping through my veins, and I wanted to go race my car later. People were be racing cars in the theater parking lot, revving their engines, and peeling out after seeing this movie. It was a pure shot of adrenaline, and a must-see for everyone."
2,Not for me....,"I rented this DVD with my ex. Of course, it was more of his kind of mobie than mine because it's a ""guy movie"". Anyway, I thought that there'd be more action and more cars. However, I was disappointed. The plot (but then again, who cared about the plot?) was flat and the characters (except Letty) were pretty weak and fake. Overall, I fell asleep towards the end of the movie."
1,Bad movie,"This is a really bad adaptation of Driven without Sly Stallone. Vin Diesel is a bad actor, and so was the rest of the cast.I loved Michelle Rodriguez is ""GirlFight"", but here she was awful.Don't bother....."
1,This Movie Defies the Laws of Physics,"...I agree ""The Fast and the Furious"" has some good action, but a Toyota running a close race with a 1000hp, supercharged, 440 cubic inch, V8 car is completely and totally ridiculous. It just defies the laws of physics!If you are one of those people who think you can modify your rice burner to run with real muscle cars, this movie is definately for you. If so, watch this movie and keep on dreaming."
1,The title tells you the alleged plot ...,"There is a lot of action and there are many angry people, so I suppose the title is accurate. What there is not is any reason whatsoever to see this film. There is no acting to speak of, no real plot development, no character development, no interesting dialogue. There is no genuine exploration of the racing subculture, or any interest in looking at what tensions, interests, or economic forces might create such a subculture. It would be interesting so understand why these people are in such dead-end, sterile lives that suicidal races and peer respect have become so important. Instead, we see a lot of cars, a lot of races, a lot of rather puerile challenges, and a lot of sex--but no intelligence, no clarity, no calls for the rest of us to examine our comfotable lives--and, in the end, no interest in the very subject the filmmakers are portraying. If it were possible to give this film no stars, I would do so."
1,Point Break with Cars,"Aside from the bad acting and only one hot chick throughout the movie, the storyline is a complete and total rip off ""Point Break"". Insert neighborhood families' beef for surfers', and heisting 18-wheelers for robbing banks as the ex-pres. Paul Walker can't even out act Keanu's ""I am an FBI agent!"" in this one. He let's Vin Diesel go in the same manner that Patrick Swayze is allowed to surf because they ""won't go back man"". If you like cars, that could be the saving grace. Otherwise, ""Point Break"" is still a classic that was poorly copied."
1,absolutely pathetic,"This movie was absolutely pathetic. It is everything that is wrong with America. The music is obnoxious and moronic, the acting sucks, (...) the plot was wretched, it was horrible! There arent enough adjectives to describe the horror of this movie. ""Cool"" cars, ""hot"" women (not really Michelle Rodriguez kinda has a mustache), gangsters, racing, in other words totally original (haha)! The WORST thing about this movie though is that it spawned the creation of other films similar to it that disease our society and rot our minds like XXX, 2Fast2Furious, to name the most obvious."
1,DUD!,"This movie is complete poo! Nice cars, and women are the only reason why this film got a star. A completely dreadful storyline, and the acting wasnt much better either. Steer clear of this."
2,have we seen this plot before????,"yeah we have! this movie is the same plot as Point Break. cop goes under cover learning some skill he is not familiar with that will allow him to be a part of the bad guys (car racing, surfing). the cop becomes best buddies with the bad guy and then the cop then falls in love with one the insider women and then blows his cover to her. at the end the cop gets the bad guy, but then lets him go. soooooo similar!"
1,for teen agers only,"As one viewer said ""did not expect much, got less"" If you are a baby boomer completely forget this movie. It is full of idiotic racing scenes in city that must have been evacuated for anthrax scare to have been possible. ridiculous Plot has the usual good guy and girl mixture with redeming bad guy thrown in. Must commend film on low level of vulgar language and indecency . Young viewers( 12-21) only."
5,"Fun, Fast, and Furious world of street racing","Great movie, heard pretty good reviews for it so I decided not to rent it but buy it at a local kmart. As soon as I popped it in my DVD-Rom (don't have a real DVD player besides Xbox) I was caught by the 3 F's of Street Racing. Before I was slightly interested in cars and sport cars but they were able to pull me into it completely. Great movie... rent at least."
1,Oh Please...,"Hollywood has reached an all time low with this movie. Even the fact that I'm female (i know there are others out there like me too) even I had to laugh at this movie. First it doesn't show the real street racing. Every person had their cars picture perfect and what not. You go out here on the East Coast, you got all kinds whether its stock, sleeper, ricey or whatever. Nobody's get together is like that. Second, the information was wrong. I laughed so many times at the almost humilating wrongness of the movie. Almost makes me embarressed to drive a Honda (which i do, and i'm proud). I saw this movie once and not because I wanted to, and I strongly recommend the real tuners and racers out there to just skip this movie and F & F 2 all together. except for Vin Diesel. If he wasn't in it, I would have turned it off after I saw Brian shifting 6-7 times in a 5 speed eclipse. i think i'm gonna be sick now."
5,So Fast but So Good,"the fast and the furious is the best movie of the summer. the cast is great and the cars are so cool . the movie blows the cake. the racing is so cool, it makes you want to go outside and try to fine illgel car racers and race with them, but over all i give it 5 stars because of the cast,cars,and of course.... the speed."
4,The Fast and the Furious,"I absoulely loved the fast and the furious. It was a great film, and very original. The cast did an amazing job and the whole storyline was put together very well. I hope many people go see it because it is one of my favorite movies and after you watch it I think it will be one of your favorites too!"
1,A very 'Furious' dumb Movie,This movie is a very stupid movie. People have died trying to race like in the movie. It gives a bad influnence on people. I think this movie is a cheesy teen flick. It is a stupid one about racing and girls. there are way more better stuff then this. When I saw this I was very dissapointed with the movie. I do however like the music in it. That's really all. I don't really like that this movie did so well. It is really stupid! I will never see that stupid movie ever again. The actors are not the best actors you've ever seen. They are really bad at acting and do not play a good roll in the movie. The script bites so does this flick. I do not recommend this movie!!!!!
2,WHERE HAVE I SEEEN THIS BEFORE?,"WOW, THERE IS SOME REALLY BAD ACTING IN THIS MOVIE. NOT TO MENTION THE PLOT. SUBSTITUTE SURFING FOR STREET RACING AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE?--- POINT BREAK! THIS MOVIE WAS ALSO VERY UNREALISTIC, AND THE CARS WHERE NOT EXOTIC AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CARS, GONE IN 60 SECONDS IS A BETTER CAR MOVIE. BUT IT DID MAKE GET IN MY CAR AND DRIVE VERY FAST. THAT'S WHY IT GETS TWO STARS INSTEAD OF 1. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
4,Adrenaline Junkie Must Have,"The cars are fast. The cinematography accents the film perfectly and gets the blood pumping even faster. No, it's not the best movie and no the acting isn't top-notch, but Vin Diesel makes the film more than worth watching. Sometimes movies are made for pure enjoyment and to get the viewer excited. This is one of those films. Sit back relax and avoid caffeine, because once the movie starts your heart won't need anything else. I also recommend that you stay home after watching the film. Watching this movie almost triples your chance of getting a speeding ticket."
3,Great car movie!,For the import freaks this is a movie you'll like! It's not the greatest movie as a movie if you know what I mean! It's a car movie!
4,"great movie, watch it!","That's a pretty good movie. I liked watching it on my chinese DVD. But you gonna like it only, if you are a racing fan. If you like hearing engine sounds such as in DRIVEN or GONE IN 60 SECONDS, you'll like this one. --> The soundtrack is fantastic (Ja Rule...)"
2,TOO FAST !,"If you like fast cars,undercover cops, macho (and i mean really macho) guys) this is your movie.No need to buy it you can allways rent it."
2,Mighta Been,"This film could have been decent. As it is, it's not the worst out there. But it's full of many holes.Keep low expectations and it might be a mildly entertaining view.** Spoiler Below **My main question is why those truck drivers didn't just hit the brakes? That would have solved everything. Instead they just kept driving along while being harpooned. Things like that really bug me because any idiot could have put a better plot device in there and made it at least mildly realistic.Without that and a quite a few other problems this might have been a pretty decent film."
3,THIS MOVIE RULED!,"I don't care what anyone says, this movie was awesome! The stunts were awesome and the chicks were great! Another thing I loved about this movie were the cars! Those cars were awesome! Peace out!"
2,3/4 Fast and 1/4 Furious,"Fast and the Furious works ,but we have seen this before. Still you wonder, have the Movie Studios stopped making risky movies? It is a recycled car movie that has all that what the other movies give to you ,but It's not a bad movie at all.I like Vin Diesel as this sort of the God of this group of nightracers. Paul Walker is very slick(SEE PAUL IN JOY RIDE!!!) actor both him and Diesel I think are very talanted.All this movie is, is a fun summer blockbuster to watch....no logic required just buckle your seat belt.... Honestly I wished Universal Pictures could have used a better movie to appeal to Teens versus what we have seen before. Stars **1/2"
1,This movie is extremely LAME,A bunch of gender-confused male posturing with no solid storyline. Lame cars. Should have got Keanu to play the undercover cop...that way at least it would have been funny to watch.
4,Fast and exciting,"The Fast and the Furious is a well made fun ride with a familar plot and a weak ending but still it's really good. It's plot is sort of like Point Break with cars instead of surf boards. With Paul Walker as an undercover cop who gets close to the people that just might be the ones committing high way robbary from truck drivers. Walker has the cocky driver role down right but he doesn't look right as a cop to me, must be the pretty boy look. Vin Diesel is da man as usual the though, he has a real career ahead of him as either just an actor or a flat out kick ass action star. The Fast and Furious leaves you wanting more car chases and more action and I really hope we get more with a sequel."
2,"Unless You're in Your Teens, Forget It","While this movie has a few high speed scenes and a great sound effects, the movie's week plot is worsened by cheesy ""I'm gonna kick your ass,"" teen talk. A semi-surprising plot twist leaves the viewer hoping for more. In the end, you've got a movie aimed at teen guys who still love cars covered in fancy crome and racing stips. Maybe it's worth a rental on a rainy day, but save your cash if you plan to own it."
4,good movie,"A great fast paced car movie that is enjoyable for almost anyone. I personally am a rodder (I build and race pre-'54 car), so I was expecting it to be a movie only ""tuners"" would like cause of the rice burners but turned out to be wrong. Also in the end, it becomes apparent that only a real man (or woman) has what it takes to drive real cars (ooooh, importboy afraid of the big bad charger!)"
3,Guilty Pleasure!,"Don't expect high end acting or much of a storyline from this movie.Paul Walker is stiff as a board & not believable as a car fanatic. I couldn't picture him even changing oil much less racing! On the other hand, Vin Diesel does well with the script he was given & looks like he fits right in. Personally, seeing Vin Diesel with his shirt off made the movie for me, but the car scenes were a big plus!Is it always correct? No way! Duh, it's a movie people! It is for enjoyment only. It is not a technical documentary about cars or racing. You have to take it for what it is...a movie about a bunch of people that love their cars & love to drive 'Fast & Furious'.There is this whole undercover cop/highjacking thing in the background, but it is so underdeveloped it's not worth worrying about.Let me put it to you this way, if you get a rush when you see Eleanore in 'Gone in 60 Seconds' (for the pure enjoyment of it being a great car) then you would be able to enjoy this movie."
4,Hi Octane fun,"This movie rocks, I never so many imports in one movie. I have to say its better than ""Gone in 60 Seconds"". The actions scenes are entense, the races are great and I think the final part was a bit suspense when Diseal trash into the truck. This movie makes the import cars look better and proves who has the better cars in this flick. They need to make more movies like this. Plus the extras in the DVD are good and the Music videos make it much better to get into the movie."
5,The Fast and The Furious,"This is an action pacted movie, with all the excitement of Gone in 60 Seconds. If you like films about fast cars,and adventure, you'll love this. This shows what a great actor Vin Diesel is and how he is going to come strong on the scene. The cars portrayed in this movie are beautiful and exciting, for women it is a exciting way to enjoy the race scene, and for men it is just plain enjoyable. I recommend this movie to everyone, young and old alike."
4,Great Cars,"This movie is all about the cars. So what if the plot was weak or repeated. It was about street racing, not surfing as in Point Break. So if you are a car fan you should enjoy this movie. It's good to see any car movie coming out of Hollywood. The cars were simply amazing. The red Mazda RX-7, orange Toyota Supra, and green Mitsubishi Eclipse were all well done with the performance modifications and body work. The race scenes are tight, but there should have been more of them in my opinion. As far as the acting goes I think Vin Diesel and Paul Walker did a good job. The ladies did a good job as well, Jordana Brewster as Mia and Michelle Rodriguez as Letty. So in conclusion, if you like car racing and women you should go see this movie."
1,Boring...,This movie was boring. The plot was ridiculous. It would have been much more interesting if they'd decided to go with a little bit of intrigue rather than just plowing through with the bad guy they'd been hinting at the whole movie. In the end the action is tedious. Go rent Bullit.
5,I would rate this movie more than 5 stars if I could!!,"This movie is something 2 watch. It has everything, especially action!!!!! This movie is All That!!!! It rocks all the way:-)Don't listen 2 tootinmassive or whatever it's name is. They DO NOT know what they R talking about. Do U hear me???? They don't!!!! Besides I also LUV this movie cuz Vin plays in it and he is ALL MINE!!!!!!:-)(LOL) Well, G.T.G. 'Bye,'Bye-Liz"
5,superb racing movie,this is a cool racing movie. the plot wasn't that good but it was covered up by the action sequences . the acting was good.this is a really good summer film for those of you who love racing movies.(Ages from 12 and above)
1,horrible!,"bad movie. i dont care if my review was helpful or not, but this movie was one of the lamest excuses for a movie ever! if you want to see a good action type movie, see rollerball!"
3,Ex-Presidents in Ricers?,"Brazen, young cop infiltrates an underground gang to solve daring robberies, falls for gang leaders gal [sister], must eventually choose between new family and career. Sound familiar? Yes, so clichéd that it could be read straight out of Point Break among other things it manages to barely find its own shallow identity. Despite the obvious parallels, Vin Diesel = Patrick Swayze [now 50, btw, yikes] I found F&F an amusing, speed pumped view. Of course this film isn't about plot, or character development, everyone is just along to set up the race and robbery scenes. Played at that level it works well, and gives voice and visions to every fan boy strapping on a coffee can to their exhaust and adding stickers to the windows of their beaters. I suppose we could fault it for contributing to some abominations seen on the streets lately, but as a simple action flick it's passable now that it's playing free on premium channels."
2,Not even a good action movie,"This movie is about the underground import street racing that has become popular in the late 90's and still is going strong today. If the movie had some more plot or some more action it would be better. The racing scenes are not that spectacular and the plot is non-exsistent. This movie would not be bad as a rental, but to buy it, save your money. Maybe if the director had added about ten more minutes into the plot then it would have been ok, but he didn't and nothing really makes sense. It seems everything happens way too quickly and we never understand what is happening."
4,fast rice rockets,It was a good movie but Rice rockets aren't as cool as European cars. it was cool to see Chad Lindberg who I went to High school with in a good movie
5,"It's a girl's dream, too!","I don't know about you, but all these reviews bother me! ""It's the ultimate guy flick,"" get real! Girls like this stuff, too, we're just not as quick to admit it. Aside from Paul Walker, Ja Rule, Tyrese(in 2Fast 2Furious) ana Vin Diesel(with his shirt off Oh My GOD!!) this movie has those amazing race scenes. And there's also a girl driving(Michelle Rodriguez)! It's also not pointless, like some action flicks, and there is a plot for us to become engrossed in, as well as the major adrenaline rush. I still get chills down my back when Dom ends his first monologue with ""Ask any racer, any real racer, it don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning's winning!"" And who doesn't want to drive the souped up Charger?"
1,Not really good on any level,"There are some flashy scenes with the Japanese cars, but that's not enough to hold this turkey up. The chase scenes in Bullitt and the French Connection are still unchallenged.This is an teenage fantasy movie. That's the only way you can explain the glaring implausabilities. This doesn't explain the bad story, weak script, and boring chase scenes.I was hoping for better brain candy, but came up snake eyes."
1,Horrible,"This is truly a bad film, reflecting certain issues and segments of our society that are truly lost and hopeless, not to mention criminal. I hope the cast and crew were well paid for their efforts. It's highly contrived and very juvenile. If not for the innovative and somewhat inspiring race scenes, this movie would be a complete waste of money, time and effort. Don't waste your time."
3,Furious with NOS,"I rated 3 stars for the Fast and the Furious, well the reason being was because they had nice rides with only imported cars it's kind of tight. In the Fast and the Furious the beginning was pretty cool, cause of the droped Honda's going under the 18 wheelers cargo, something real astonishing. In my point of view I, myself like the whole movie. But the problem was they didn't have enough muscle cars. I mean what was the whole point of having a cool movie of racing cars but not even other faster cars. Specially they got too exaggerated with Nos. They could of least use Camaro's, Corvettes, Mustang's GT's, Cobras, Bullets, Vipers, and some older car's. ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" was way better than this movie."
5,Awesome,"The Fast and the Furious has become one of my favorite movies of all time. I never get tired of watching this action packed movie over and over again. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel give great performances, the cars are beautiful, and the plot is amazing."
1,An experiment in shallow banality.,"With much chagrin, I was forced to view this cavalcade of absurdity with my straight friends. Being a movie buff, and a fan of Paul Walker and Van Diesel (grrrrowl!) I thought I would admit defeat and give in.This is the WORST movie I have ever seen, and yes, I DID see Armageddon.The plot is...well, there is no plot. But if there is, it's dumbed down for an audience of lowbrows. Is this what 100 years of filmmaking has led up to? Oy guvalt.To play devil's advocate tho, I was upset that this movie wasn't nominated for any animation Oscars, since primarily all the car chase sequences aren't even REAL."
2,"A few thrilling sequences, but otherwise shoddily paced.","Paul Walker is an undercover cop who gets too involved in the underground world of racing. Vin Diesel is the criminal he eventually befriends. Not much plot-wise, and there aren't nearly enough chases or races to make up for the incredibly slacking pace and overdone, headache-inducing visuals. The truck-siege in the climax is obviously inspired by the similar setpiece in The Road Warrior, but doesn't compare in terms of sheer excitement (or even in size, scope, and length). Walker took a far more enjoyable trip in Joy Ride."
4,The Fast and the Furious,"This makes a great example proving that action movies can have good stories behind them. The movies tells you enough about the characters to let you know what they are all about. A good not so clean fun summer movie worth the eight bucks. Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordanna Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez do their thing."
3,"good action, but totally meaningless.","Some scenes in the movie were impresive, and the racing wasn't bad, much better than Driven. But the story was meaningless and confusing, even misleading to the kids; And the acting was not superb. Some of the plot didn't make any sense, and the ending was so unfinished. By the way, the sound was extremely loud during the movie, I had to cover my ears. Still, some parts really did grab my attention. So, three stars."
2,The slow and plotless.,"Basically POINT BREAK with souped up cars instead of surfboards. Not much in the story and action dept., this flick has the momentum of a tricked-out pedestrian."
1,What a piece ...movie this is,"They shouldn't of called this the Fast and the Furious, it should've been called Point Break 2. Same exact story except it's an under cover cop in street racing cars instead of on a surf board, and it has the same bad acting. I don't know who discovered Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, but they have about as much talent as a rock. They only way I tolerated this movie is because there are so many nice cars in it, that it makes it worth watching, but only once."
5,Quit Whining,"I think it is sad that these people writing these reviews are so mad and critical about a movie that was created for the sole purpose of portraying an underground car club. Have you ever heard of FICTION????? It's an interesting concept where people ignore their dismal, ordinary lives and actually try to enjoy a movie about fast cars and hot women. I know that it's hard to do this when you are driving a primer-spotted metro, but seriously, where has the sense of adventure and imagination gone. If you ever had the experience to drive a car like the ones in this movie, you wouldn'd know what do do. You have to respect the workmanship that went into these cars and the imagination that went into the customization of them. I happen to know from experience that a modified fuel injected V6 or 4-cylinder can outrun most carbourated V8's. To the reference about the V8's doing wheelies, it's a combination of rear-wheel drive and POWER. Please don't criticize things that you know NOTHING about!"
5,BUY THIS AS SOON AS IT COMES OUT,"Best movie of 2001 hands down, buy it as soon as it comes out, but leave a copy for me. This is the best edge of your seat speaker busting heart pounding sexy thriller of the year, buy it buy it buy it, and buy one for each of your friends too!"
3,GREATEST MOVIE!!!!!!!!!,dude this movie was the greatest movie ever if u haven't seen it u better get ur butt out there and see this movie vin diesel and paul walker r the hottest guys ever and they r soooooo great in this movie and so r all the actors and actress' and if u think it's just a guy movie u r totally wrong me and my female friends went to see it and we all thought it was the best movie!! it so exciting theres always somthin happening it's definitly not boring!! this is definitly the best movie of this summer!! so u better go see it!!
1,This is the worst movie i have seen in a long time.,I'm not even going to waste my time with an in depthreview of why this movie makes me angry.All that's going for it are the cars.Save your money and buy midnight club 2.vin diesel is the worst actor since pamela anderson.
1,Horrible,The whole movie is just Horrible. Vin Diesel is the worst actor that has ever hit the big screen. Paul Walker isn't any better. The movie is predicatable and just not good. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,"Awful, dreadful and nearly unwatchable...","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie too ! A few fast cars and some of the other mindless trappings that usually accompany this type of action film can make for a cool diversion. Unfortunately, the story line is absurd and the dialogue is unintentionally laughable. As for the action scenes, the 1/4 mile drag races last more than a minute which about the time it would take a fast runner to complete the distance. This movie disappoints across the board..."
4,This movie will ROCK you!,This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat! It is very fast paced and exciting. It has an interesting twist that is unsuspected. Pimped out cars with bad a** engines and lots of NOS. If you liked Gone in 60 Seconds this movie will blow you away! The music rocked through the whole movie. They definitely need to make a sequal as you could do a whole lot past the ending of this film. Highly recommended.
1,"three words-""this-movie-...""","I recommend you buy any movie but this. Don't waste any time buying, waiting for it to come in the mail, and watching this crappy movie. This is a disgrace to movies. I heard this movie was good, then i watched it. It seems this movies plot was made by a crazy monkey who writes with his poop on walls. Do not waste your good 20 bucks on this movie I beg of you DO NOT BUY THIS DISGRACE TO ALL THINGS CALLED ""MOVIES""!!"
1,Disgusting,"Package a movie with lots of girls, guys, big bangs, vrooms and Limp Bizkit and Ja Rule songs, and it is almost guaranteed to be a hit. This ... is meant strictly for the MTV audience. No substance at all. I even prefer ""The Animal"" to this waste."
1,4 Flat Tires,I am just going to keep this short:1. Irresponsible movies like this one which are geared towards stupid and impressionable teens are partly to blame for countless of traffic tragedies.2. The acting (and I use this turn loosely) is so bad you actually think this is a SNL skit.3. The plot is moronic at best.4. The actual racing is not even remotely impressive.5. How they made a sequel to this trash is more baffling than Astro-Physics.
2,"Been there, Done that ...","I liked this movie better when it had Keanu Reeves and was called 'Point Break'...Not a bad movie, all the performances are well done (although disposable) and the action scenes are a lot of fun. However, it's not exactly breaking any new ground either.I'm really not sure I'd spring twenty bucks to buy a copy, but it's definitely something I'd make it a point to see either as a rental or on cable."
1,"Oh, please","Once upon a time, somewhere in Hollywood, someone said, ""Hey, lets [mimic] Point Break, make it brainless and unwatchable, and it will become a box office SMASH!"" Naturally, he was immediately rushed to the funny farm and never heard from again. Oh, no, wait a minute, this is Hollywood! They went through with it and it made millions.The only thing that kept me awake throughout this ""movie"" was the loud DVD sound. (By the way, I'm 16, so don't think I'm some stiff old professor type) The plot? There was none. Unless the stupid street racing thing was supposed to be a plot. Sadly, I think it was...Anyway, if you crave a movie with a plot and at least halfway-decent acting, stay far away.Okay, you can click ""not helpful"" now..."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"I saw this movie yesterday thinking it'd be exciting. I sure am glad that I survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie. There's no story line, the acting is pathetic, whoever gave Vin Diesel the idea that he can act. Like an earlier reviewer observes it's about who's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review!"
1,THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN ACTED BETTER IF THEY USED REAL RETARDS!!!!!!!,"I can't give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there's the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling ""1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!"" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer:Give it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A solid 8 out of 10!,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! There's lots of fighting and car racing, many scenes of suspenseful music, some funny parts, and this is one of the few PG-13s with the ""F bomb"" in it. Also, there is a ton of good acting and there are many scenes that teenagers and adults would get a kick out of, as well. Vin Diesel, who is one of my favorite actors of all time, does very well here and is cool as always. This movie is great, and I highly recommend it to everyone."
1,Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!,"What the hell is going on? People actually think this is a great movie? Why go to all that trouble to steal a bunch of DVD players? Hey Vin, I know you're not the smartest but here's a tip - deal drugs, there's more money in it. An utterly shallow and ridiculous movie that is based entirely on Vin Diesel being attractive to the opposite sex. And maybe gay guys too but I haven't asked. Not that he is required to 'act' at all. That would get in the way of him looking moody and mumbling a lot."
4,"""Point Break"" except with street racing","That's about it. It's basically a rip-off of Point Break. In fact the plot is almost exactly like ""Point Break"". Think about it."
5,A excellent movie for car lovers,"Is this on par with Gone with the Wind or The African Queen. No, obviously not, but it is a great car movie. If you enjoy cars and like the street racing scene then this movie is for you. There are classic movies which are timeless and then there are movies which are just darn fun. This movie is the latter of the two."
2,Glossy with potential but empty with effect,"This film seems to be very high in a glossy, shiny image but it really lacks in acting and believability. Paul Walker almost seems like he is a robot when reciting his lines in many scenes, and his ability to strain a look of concern makes my head hurt all the more. Vin Diesel is really no better, and even though he played a great villain in the movie ""Pitch Black"", his try at being a rebel without a cause/but with a cool car is stagnant. What the film is really good at are chase and race scenes, but the story involving an undercover agent and gangs who seem invincible is shallow, hollow and downright ludicrous. This film probably appeals to middle school kids who dream of having a souped up Honda with a fancy paintjob."
5,This is by far the best action/racing movie of all time!!,"For those who saw and loved ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", you will definately love this movie. Although this movie also has really nice sport-racing cars and excellent looking women, I still think it is 10 times better than ""Gone in 60 seconds""; with exciting high speed chases and hot rodding scenes going well over 220 mph. This movie also has an excellent soundtrack, and not to mention, an excellent plot that cannot be beat! I have seen it in the theatre five times, and I just bought it here at the best price I could find anywhere! I know that I will be watching this movie over and over again for the years to come. It was definately worth my time and it has always kept me on the edge of my seat!"
2,Naive!,"This is a very simple and navie movie of car racing. I just can't help laughing when seeing guys just simply pressing button to win the race. No corner, just a straight runway in the races."
2,Disco Fever 3 cd's,I came from the Disco era. I like to listen to Disco music. I was a little disappointed when I bought this 3 cd set. It has a lot of good songs on it if you liked disco. The only problem is the songs are performed by the soundalikes instead of the original artists. If you like the soundalikes performing your favorite dicso songs you liked during that era then I would say buy it. But if you don't like that then I would say don't buy it. Sandy McClaflin
4,GREAT WHODUNIT !!! CREATIVE CHARACTERS,"This would be an excellent book to read while relaxing at any one of the pools in Las Vegas. I didn't read this while in Vegas, However if you have been to Vegas you can identify with a lot of the locations mentioned. (even though some are fictional in the book)Iam looking forward to their next book."
1,poor quality,"Quite a good film from Angela Mao,but a very bad print,even by the worst of the Kung Fu prints that are available.Its in full Widescreen ,but mastered from an old VHS tape.There is also a very green color cast on the film throughout.Sound is also very bad.all high end no middle or bass with a bad hum.If you must have it,as a Angela Mao fan its watchable...Having said the above I quite enjoyed it."
5,Great Effective Resource,"I already own this book. You will have to spend a little money in the beginning getting a few oils. The recipes in here are simple and easy to follow, but most importantly effective. I used to think aromatherapy was only changing your mood based on scent-but who knew you can absorb the herbs,flowers,etc. through your skin to heal yourself from the inside out? I think this is a great reference that everyone should have on hand especially if you want to try to heal yourself naturally while smelling great."
2,Not Worth Buying,"My only problem with this CD is that in every song he refers to Pac and Biggie. He's trying to sell CDs by refering to Pac, Biggie and 50. There are some songs that are decent...Dreams, How We Do, and Like Father Like Son. Other than those songs, it's a real disappointment. Glad I didn't buy it if you know what I mean!"
1,Game Over,"This cd already got 5 stars because one guy is doing reviews under different names.The Game is just in is 15 minutes of fame because he's not going to stay in the game for long. The review is saying that he's the hope of gangsta rap. Gangsta rap don't need hope because we still got the legen, Snoop Dogg. He's still doing classic cd's and the new hit that reached #1 on the charts(Drop it like it's hot)is the bomb. Game you should try to follow another profession cuz' you can't rap homeboy.I'm hoping for a new cd of Dr.Dre with Snoop Dogg.Peace"
3,Game is hot but he's not real...,"Okay now that I got your attention, Game is tight, he's no jay Z, Biggie, Tupac, Nas, or a black eminem, and lets be serious neither is 50. When will these rappers learn that we don't want to just hear about sex, guns, and drugs, EVERY RAPPER CAN RAP ABOUT SEX, GUNS, AND DRUGS, Tupac was wayyyy deeper than that and thats why he is a legend.Oh and to reply to that guy that said game could have sold the amount of records he did without 50 is stupid. 50 brougt Game into the public eye through his G-unit clique, lets be honest any rapper who is accepted by the G-Unit, eminem, and Dre are almost automatically heavy weights, so don't think for one second that 50 had nothing to do with Games success. Even with Dre Game still needed 50's voice on his tracks to sell albums."
3,Bench Warmer,"If you enjoy a fake set trippin' artist who did shows like change of heart ""Game"" is the music you need. this album sold whell for the simple fact of ""50 Cent on his singles and a bunch of great producers to over shadow his lyrics. can't front it was an ok album for a quick second but definatly one of those to bore you after awhile and get played out cause you need more then just great production."
4,NEW SOUND FOR G-UNIT,"I think its good that G-Unit is bringing in different sounds with the game and young buck. When I first heard the album I wasnt so sure what I thought about it.... you may say I was a little disappointed, but I was expected to be blown away.The album turns out to be a pretty solid album. We all know that his first single ""How We Do"" was hot but there are a lot of others too. Westside Story feat 50 Cent was a good track along with Dreams produced by Kanye and Higher produced by DRE. Put You on the Game which was produced by Timbaland is a good up tempo track. One of my favorites was the Documentary were he gives loves to all the classic rap albums before him. Then there is We Aint feat Em.... just another hot track that you gotta hear.the rest of the album is good but these listed above are the standouts for me. People seem to have mixed feelings about this album but I havent meet anyone who has hated it. If you are G-Unit fan.... go pick this up and give it a good listen."
3,BEATS ARE FIRE! GAME IS OLD AND ROTTEN!,"All throughout, The Game laces you with mediocrity. I swear, EVER SINGLE TRACK ON THIS ALBUM, The Game mentions either Dr. Dre, Eminem, 50 Cent, Impala, Lowrider, G-Unit Sneakers, etc. It gets old and predictable after a while. Find some new material Mr. Game. You aren't going to ressurect the West Coast by repeating weak material like that in every song. Producers are excellent. Dr. Dre never dissapoints (He produces the hell out of the track entitled ""Higher""), Timbaland is INCREDIBLE, Kanye is good, Cool & Dre are INCREDIBLE, Just Blaze is good etc...But you game are lucky that Aftermath laced you with such a colorful musical backdrop. Without these beats, Game, this would have been a horrible CD. It is just an average CD, buy it for the beats. I repeat, lyrics are bad beats are good. Add this item to your shopping cart with that in mind.Peace & Love"
1,The Documentary should never be a good album.,"The Documentary has got to be the most overrated west coast album since E40's album , to say that this is the revival of the west coast rap/gangsta rap must be on some kind of acid trip, although the album has great production, it cannot save this album from game's lame rapping, overlong lyrics and 50's performance on the album is even worse.I Just hope game releases a much better album soon than this.The Documentary just didn't work for me at all.I'm gonna wait for crooked i's album this fall.Music Rating *1/2 Stars."
3,Doesn't Amount to G-Unit Status,"Can you say bust?! If it isn't for the well known producers such as Just Blaze, Kanye and Dr. Dre and appearances by 50 cent then this album would most definately be out the window. Yes there are a few tracks on here worth listening to but once you listen to those and find yourself skipping through the rest, you wonder if it was a good idea by 50 and fellow members of the group/label to sign him. I guess i'll just have to wait for another album and hope it's better."
2,Fun and Games,"I rate this album a 2 only because Dr. Dre had his hands in the stew (otherwise I'd rate it a 1). All this hype about Game aka ""Fun and Games"", I can't see it. I think they're just using this guy as a slogan to try to put the westcoast back on the map. Even though Goldie Loc and Tray Deee are older cats, to me they can put the west back if they had the proper promoting. The Eastsidaz was puting a dent on the West until Snoop screwed them (how's that for a homy?!) I'm not hating on ""Fun and Games"", we need fresh young blood to put their thing down and get opportunities, but damn at least get somebody with fire and not another 50 cent who gets fame because of how many times they been shot! And oh yeah...to the person that's snitchin'...stop that! It's up to Amazon to catch the person that's making multiple posts not you."
2,"Above Average Beats, Below Average Rhymes","The Game's ""Documentary"" is a fair album that has already produced some radio-friendly singles and will probably have a few more before it stops getting pushed. The Dre beats are, as is usual for Dre's work, very good, however The Game is lyrically not very talented. He seems to have fallen into that increasingly large category of contemporary hiphop artist that relies more on studio polish and high production values than pure rapping talent to get his point across. He would probably be an awful live performer. The album tracks are listebable but it's a bit difficult to get over the fact that any average streetcorner MC could torch this guy in a freestyle battle. My advice is to download the songs so that you can delete them from your computer/iPod/whatever when you get tired of them, rather than drop the money for the CD and realize a couple of months from now that you could have bought a better album or new headphones instead."
4,This CD Is Awesome,"Go and get this cd! It is tight. Westside Story which you all have heard is very good. Hate It or Love It with 50 Cent is an awesome song on this cd. Put U on the Game will get you on the block bustin your gun, also the song featuring Eminem is dope as hell. This cd features some very good artists like, Busta Rhymes,50 Cent, Eminem, Nate Dogg, and some other good artists. Just go out and cop this album you won't be dissappointed."
2,The first major flop of 2005!,"Yea im sure this album will go about 2x plat because 50 has all you suburban kids brainwashed but that still don't take away the fact this album is trash. I was expecting to hear some classic Dre beats but was sad to find out Dre's beats(should note this includes all the people who really do his beats)were weak with the exception of higher. Game proves he can't rap about anything else other than being shot or yelling out other rappers names on record. How lame is he for dissing Jigga on one song then appologizing on the same album! Hi-Tek drops one of the best beats ""runnin"" too bad Tony Yayo didn't realize this and almost kills the song. Cool and Dre drop the other banger where 50 reveals his mother liked other woman. Game you better enjoy your 15 minutes of fame because its gonna come and go like your girl did on change of heart! In the words of yukmouth f%^& the tongue ring queen!"
2,Overrated!,"Here are the ingredients for a gold record these days:One solid producer like Dr. Dre with credibilityFour of five mediocre-good rappersAdd a large dosage of hype and marketing from a large record companyInsert a wack rapper who talks about guns, girls and 22 inch wheelsRepeat as needed!!!"
2,Puleeeeze,"Look I can spell...Is this what all the hype was about? I'm not impressed. The flow is so-so (a la everyone else in G-Unit). He's swingin' on NWA's and Eazy's nuts way too much and evidently the only thing he values is his air force one's which he talks about on every joint. Didn't Dr. Dre say he gave the DETOX beats to The Game? Where are they? I think there were three, maybe four beats by Dr. Dre at best. This is living proof that creativity is starting to run dry in rap. This is a less than average rap album given above average advertisement. A lot of you have been fooled into thinking that something is good because it's ""supposed to be"". Keep being led to the slaughter you sheep!"
1,The Lame,"Nice creative and original name there you jerk! Since when did being down with 50 Cent, Eminem, and Kanye West ever hold any weight with real Hiphop listeners? Funny, he complains about too much of rap being bubblegum bullsh**. Hypocrite! The mainstream is dying, they must be searching if the Game is their latest hype that they try to trick people into. Once again, here's another d*ckface who's selling records 'cause he been shot before. OMG! If you listened to this, you are a brainwashed zombie! If you want some real Cali Hiphop spend your dough on any Aceyalone/Haiku D'Etat, Zion I, Del tha Funkee Homosapien/Hieroglypics albums. Y'all WAKE UP!"
4,better than i thought,"after listening to the game cd , it was better than i expected . I remember hearing his underground albums with jt tha bigga figga, and it was stright trash, but this was better than i had expected"
4,THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR.,"Brilliant story-telling rap riding over some awesome production from some of the best in the buisness. Honest and reflective, The Game presents his life story with some fantastic west-coast gangsta lyrics which respect his predescessor's contributions to what survives today in rap music.Highlights include: 'Don't Need Your Love', 'Dreams', 'Westside Story', 'Hate It Or Live It', 'Higher' and 'How We Do'.This album is essential."
4,The new Game album goes beyond my expectations...,"I was blown away after I heard the new CD. THe beats are some of the best I have heard in a long time. I doubted Dre for going with someone who sounded like a 50 Cent clone. I will never doubt him again, this is indeed the a great release to kick the year off. I think this will go on to be one of the best releases of the year as well. Kanye did it early last year and the Game did it early this year. Kanye and the Game are on a diferent level, but life is full of different perspecties. Most of the time he raps about experience and not the same old bitches, bling, and car related garbage that pollutes mainstream airwaves. It is very rare that I find mainstream stuff that I enjoy, but this is top notch. Cop it now!!!"
5,Is Compton in da house?,Without a doubt! How can anyone give this cd a one star rating? that is the sign of a hater. This cd delivers the hype. Dope beats- so good- on the beats alone can make this a classic. Lyrics are great(not a lyrical masterpiece- but for the subject- is better than average). man- this is an artist's dream come thru- with all the superstar production team. my favorite is Timbaland's masterpiece. Stop teh hating- G Unit's solo releases have all been dope. can't wait for Tony Yayo's release. bottom line- this is one of the best cd's to be put out in a while.
1,Its not worth all that hype,"Everybody and their mama and their uncle is jocking this album like it will save the rap game. Unfortunately for all of us, the joke is on us! This album is slightly more pleasing to the ear than a dentist's drill! The simple fact, as anyone who knows anything about real hip-hop can attest, this album is garbage from the cliched subject matter (women, chrome and guns) to the repetitive beats that sound like they were made in 1993! Combine this with the fact that The Game has to name drop on nearly every song and has some wack guests (Feminem, 50 etc) and you get one horrible album!Avoid this album like a blood sample from an African village!"
1,Game's are for babies,"Game tries to act so hard, but he's just a little sorry-ass punk. The only reason he's got a following now is because all the 50 haters needed somebody else they could di**-ride. His solo raps are lame, and by the way, did ANY of his tracks get radio-play besides ""How We Do"" or ""Hate It Or Love It?"" And Game even did that weak little collabo with R. Kelly, where he's still singing 50's verses. Too bad Game got kicked out of school and lost his scholarship for being an idiot. Maybe he would have actually been a decent basketball player; speaking of which, he raps about as good as Ron Artest, but Ron Artest is more gangsta, Hah!!"
3,The Documentry - The Game,"I have been listening to Game's album for a while now and i think that whoever said that he brought the West Coast back on the map is not compeletely wrong, but partially wrong! He did put west coast back on the map but if u listen to his tracks carefully he is spittin the same stuff other rappers today r rappin about (Guns, Drugs, Cars, Shoes, Jewelry)! The topic is old!The album is not that bad overall. The production is obviously off the hook (It's produced by DR.DRE)! Guest Appearances r good, and the cd length is perfect. If Game could change his flow a bit and may be rap about other stuff too (less about his shoes), then i would think that u can compare him to Snoop and Ice Cube.Standout Tracks:Westside StoryHIgherDon't Need Your LoveWe Ain'tBuy it if u a hardcore rap fan, if not then definitely burn a copy cuz u don't wanna miss out on anything. This is just my opinion, for other people this might be a great album!"
5,Great CD!!,"This is a great CD. ALmost all of the songs are hot and the beats are amazing (produced by Dr. Dre). The Game, Dr. Dre's protege, has some pretty crazy lyrics too as in ""Higher""and life-based song ""The Documentary"". So go out and get the CD. Here are some of my favorite songs:1. This Is How We Do2. Higher3. Westside Story4. The Documentary5. We Ain't (Produced By Eminem)6. Put You On The Game7. Start from Scratch (Produced By Dr. Dre)Also the DVD is the Documentary of his life. It shows his life up until know, how he was shot, and his gang The Black Wall Street. His DVD is about an hour long and also has lots of extras. The DVD itself is worth the money. THe CD/DVD combo receives a 5-Star and is worth every penny."
3,Westcoast starts the fire in 05',"One of the most anticipated albums in 05 ""The Documentary"" was looking was looking good with its first single ""How we Do"" feat. 50. Of Course the album lived up 2 the hype but in a way it doesnt feel like The Game u might not expect. The Documentary has your ""A"" list producers such as Kanye West, Havoc, Just Blaze, Timbo, Scott Storch, and of course the Doc. As Far as lyrics go The Game does deliver few shock and aw lyrics throughout the album, but some of his lyrics sounds young (ameture) only on a few tracks. If you've been waiting on this album for a while or need somone new to listen to in the car or in your portable player go get it ,but if you down too that last 20 bucks just wait and feed yo damn self!"
1,WACK,"As long as Dr. Dre is alive , you'll see alot of WACK Mc's doin garbage such as this album.Why did Dr.Dre removed Zach De La Rocha from "" Aftermath "" Records??Becuase doesnt represent pimps and h*es like other signed members ( including busta rhymes ).The new rappers dedicate their songs for the kids , so any kids under 18 years old , go and get a copy of this album , cuz its the WACKNESS itself.All the new Rappers are out for the money and Mtv , BUT HIPHOP Is NOT MTV , and this quote by the Teacha KRS-One goes out to all the new runners in the rap game."" I'm All About The Unity Of Miss & Misters , Ur All About Grabbin Money & Dissin Our Sisters """
3,Note to: THE GREATEST,MVP is Most Valuable Playa you dunder head and if you are correct that no talent is needed anymore to succeed then pick up a mic and get in there yourself. We all know you fit the criteria perfectly.
3,game year as a rapper wasn't a game,he started out this year with two hits with 50 cents then went his separate ways and leave the g unit group and found success on his own make 2 very good hits by himself dreams and his other song that the game made in the fall was underratted in my opinion it had a nice different beat mostly all his songs didn't disappoint the game kept his word at the n of last yr because he said 2005 he was going to have a very good year and he so he did all his songs were nearly off the charts but i have yet heard from his sneakers line yet which he calls the hurricane i can't wait to see how it looks i know he is going to win at least one grammy for being best new rap artist
2,nothing special,"Aight, let me summarize all the lyrics of this album for you in a couple of sentences.1. I am from Compton.2. I love NWA, Nas, Jay-z, Pac, BIG...(the list goes on). That is why I have to drop their names in every song.3. Dr.Dre and 50 are my friends, so, as follows, I will also call their names out on every bar.4. I ride Impalas and like Nike Air Ones.That's it!!!!!! I ain't kidding! Nothing original, no jaw-dropping rhymes to spit, no flava or style! He gets outshined by the beat on every track (hence the 2 stars - for the beats). I regret so much that I bought this crap. I mean, I liked him on Westside story, but that is the only track where he doesn't only rap about the 4 things described above.My only wish is that somewhere there is a cat with an ill lyrical talent and skills like those of Biggie, Nas or Big L, who will blow all these whack cats away from the rap scene for good."
3,Who is this guy?,"Mark my words, you will hear more about Game getting into fights or getting shot at within the next year. This dude is see through and I can tell that he ain't real. He was shot.....SO WHAT!! He probably was shot tryin to run away from some real gangsters. You can tell through out the album that he's a manufactured gangster. Someone told him that all you have to do a mention all the stereo-typicle stuff (low riders, rims, gang affiliations, WEST SIDE, etc), mix in some Dre beats (don't get me wrong the beats are the best part of the album) and throw in a couple of 50 cent cameos and you have a gangster album. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that you have to compare your self to 2Pac at least 2 times every song. This kid is garbage. The beats are off the chain. If you really want to hear this album, download it! Don't waist your money."
4,The Best album,The album is better than his second album and from the first song to the last song they are all hits. The album is not lacking from production and lyrical content. The guet appearances on the album compliment it perfectly.
4,The Game,"Hearing most of these songs, you can tell that The Game will be on top for a long time. Unlike new rappers like 50 cent and other crap coming out, this rapper has lyrical talent that comes into play with his songs. Hopefully he wont go downhill like 50 cent did, with jealousy and dissing rap's legendary artists. The Game is one in a life time rapper that has really deep lyrics that everyone should pay attention to. Being a very picky person in my music taste, The Game is on my top 5 list of rappers. But one should not compare The Game to Tupac, even though they might share quiet a few things in common, The Game is representing himself, not a Tupac or Biggie wannabee. Kudos to Jayceon Taylor. If youre tired of pop-rap and junk like that, buy this album, if you know what real rap sounds like."

1,NO!!!!,"This album was a big disappointment. It doesn't live up to its hype at all. Like I said, anybody can sign to Shady/Aftermath and be successful. He has no talent what so ever, he just got all the hype because Dr. Dre was producing the album. This album sucks worse than Eminem's Encore."
1,Game Please,Please game quit the game while is still time do to it.You only get 3 stars because some fool is giving 5 stars with different names because if he didnt do that this cd will be only 2 stars
1,Why?,If this cd was so it won't be needing a nerd to come here all the time and do reviews under various names giving the cd 5 stars.Even Game will mock your for that because thats stupid.If this cd was so good then it won't be needing that.
1,Just Bad,I tought Game's debut would be better because this album is not worthy.Game ruins the beats from Dre.And he talks about stupid and silly things.That's why you shouldnt buy this album
3,aiight,this was no 5 star album but it wasnt bad some good tracks some bad it wasnt all i thought it was gonna be dissapointment . . no but could be better
1,At least...that was it,"I expected a better cd.That talking just for nothing, I can't believe it.Game aint gangsta,is just a wanksta"
1,not much,Game you should be shot in the head so you can't make this bad cd.Rappers like you are ruining the rap world
3,Decent,"Respect game for dissin 50 haha. His lyrics arent THAT good but decent. The production is nice. Overall alright.#1.Intro#2.Westside Story - 3/5#3.Dreams - 3/5#4.Hate It Or Love It - 1/5#5.Higher - 3/5#6.How We Do - 1/5#7.Dont Need Your Love - 2/5#8.Church For Thugs - 4/5#9.Put You On The Game - 3/5#10.Start From Scratch - 5/5#11.The Documentary - 3/5#12.Runnin - 3/5#13.No More Fun And Games - 2/5#14.We Aint - 3/5#15.Where Im From - 5/5#16.Special - 2/5#17.Dont Worry - 5/5#18.Like Father, Like Son - 3/5An alright album. West Coast!!!"
2,overrated....,"Yo this cd is wack so is this guy. He cant rap his lyrics are nothing new and he uses to many name references which is anoyyin. This dude may be the most overrated cat this year all because hes with g-unit who is also overrated. The only reason their music sells is because of dres beats, otherwise their lyrics are subpar and their flow is average if even that. No, this aint the ressurection of the west, wait till dres detox album for that. This guy is mainly one hit wonder material. Dont buy into the hype because you will be sadly dissappointed..."
1,Enough,I don't know why Dre recruited this kid and produce his cd.He's getting crazy.I want the Dre that sing with Snoop and produce good artists and make classic hits like Nuthin But a G thang and The Next Episode.This boy ain't no gangsta.He said that this was the story of his life and what a bad life.He can't think.Stay on the ghetto boy cuz' Im in here and I sing better than you.The only ones that are making good rap are Kanye West and a few more and Snoop is making the gangsta rap because the others are just commercial music like this cd where you see guys that watch MTV and are home n*ggas giving this cd 5 stars just because they saw the video at mtv.Game you can't think.All that you done has been done before.
2,Nothing Special...,"Just when you think G-Unit can't come up with anymore annoying members, they do.I'll admit, some songs are catchy. That's all it has going for it, catchyness. I especially like the Kanye West produced track ""Dreams"" - but that's because Kanye West produced it.This album really isn't worth buying. Game's skills are pretty much non-existant."
1,stop that,"Don't believe this except for the part that says Snoop dogg is da best gangsta rapper:THE DOCUMENTARY, (Aftermath/G Unit/Interscope), the debut album from The Game (a/k/a Jayceon Taylor), announces the arrival of the most significant West Coast gangsta rapper since Snoop Dogg more than a decade earlier. With guest spots from 50 CENT, NATE DOGG and several others, as well as producers from DR. DRE to KANYE WEST to JUST BLAZE and tracks such as ""How We Do"" feat. 50 Cent, ""Like Father Like Son,"" ""Church For Thugs,"" ""Dreams,"" ""Where I'm From"" and ""Westside Story,"" THE DOCUMENTARY resurrects the truth, spirit and hope of hardcore rap."
5,Plain and simple HOT!,I first heard about this cd from a friend with no taste but he put it in and it was all over. Deffentally the best album out since Kanye's College Dropout! Got pick it up you wont regret it
4,Cool,"This cd is pretty good.I mean the kid ain't no Snoop Dogg or Jay-Z but he can rap and he got flow.The beats by Dr. Dre are the best, because he's the best productor of all times.Game shouldn't sing with Eminem because he is a commercial weak b*tch and he can't rap.How We Do it's just amazing and Westside Story with Snoop is even better than with 50.I hope Game and Snoop can make a song together so that The Game can learn with Snoop and when he leaves at least we have The Game.Game you're almost there.Hope in your next cd I can give you 5 stars.He's good to see that The Game knows that he learned with NWA, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, Jay-Z and Nas.The Game got game"
3,Decent,"The Documentary did not live up to my expectations. The production is decent, and there are a couple of sic songs, like 'Put You On The Game', and 'How We Do' ft. 50 Cent, but the CD in general is nothing special. I think The Documentary would have been a lot better if Game had not talked about rollin' with Dre, G-Unit, and Eminem in every song. Still, it's worth buying, and the DVD which comes with the collector's edition is sic."
2,Just As I Expected...,"Ok...Maybe I didnt listen to this album enough, but I really was not impressed by the beats or the lyrically flow. In my opinion a ""good"" hip hop tune needs a heavy and tight hook, a beat that stays in your head and is soo good that the lyrical content becomes a bonus. This album doesn't havent, in fact most hip-hop albums these days are like that.70mins in length filled mostly with ""fillers"", tunes are dull, so is his voice and NO i dont think he is a lyrical craftsmen. It's just about acceptable to listen to, but no where near what some peeps have been giving it..."
1,What the hell,"There's one guy saying that Snoop is pop.If it wasn't for Snoop game wouldn't be here.He started this gangsta sh*t and that's the thanks he get.Snoop is a legend.He sold more than 50 million cd's.Doggystyle he's the best rap cd ever.Rap can't touch his knees and that's why is always talking about snoop.This cd is lame and game didn't work nothing.Buy Crunk Juice,R&G,Streets Disciple or College Dropout.Game is nothing."
2,Just doensn't have the lyrics...,"The production on this album is pretty good, but the lyrics are horrible. It seems that Game can not rap without comparisions. For example, he always says ""like I'm this"" or ""like I'm that"". Real lyricist don't always say what they are like, and they spit about something worthwile. Game does not. However, I would recommend this album if you are in love with Game's sound; you probably will not like his wack lyrics though. If you are looking for good lyrics I would recommend Ludacris' Red Light District, Beanie's new joint, and especially Will Smith's Lost and Found over this CD.PS: The only good lyrics that Game has is on Hate It or Love It; none of the other songs even compare lyrically..."
1,what's wrong with shady/aftermath,"jeez all this cd is about is dissing people. like murder inc, and other people shady hates, and the game is one of them. i wasn't very impressed. come on when will shady ever release a cd that doesn't have any one dissing other people. well you know what the game is the pain."
3,WTF?!,This CD isn't a bad one but he keeps talking about Pac and Biggie. He never knew them. He disgraces there names by dragging them through this mainstream productions. He can't build a name for himself so he uses theres for publicity. He's a sellout with some talent. Thats that.R.I.P. Pac
3,The beats make this album.,"If Game didnt have hot beats or 50 Cent vocals this album would not be on my listenables. He just spits typical gangsta rap and doesn't have any intelligence or story telling abilities. He also resorts to name dropping alot, he drops the name Dre like 50 times, literally. But the beats alone are worth listening to this."
2,Get ya own style...,"Anyone who has this cd play number 10 start from scratch and tell me it dont sound like hes tryn to sound like former shady/aftermath rapper Joe Beast! If you wanna hear the one dre shoulda kept check him out on kazaa. Beast is not signed with them no more but he did a few songs with Game thats are stright and his cd(14 Grams)is one of the best I own,so when i heard this song i just took the cd out and tossed that!!!"
2,I ain't feelin this guy....,"The Game ain't much or a rapper as he is a commercial. In every song he always drops a name, Tupac, Big, Nas, Jay-z, Flav Flav....anyone can get on a mic and drop names. He has NO flow...if you wanna know what flow is then go listen to Biggie. His lyrical skills....well lets just say he was better off at droppin names than he is at comin up with dope lyrics.The only reason this album gets 2 stars from me is cause the production is pretty good...which is prolly the only reason this album is getting any acclaim. Most of the people who think the Game is a great rapper also think that G-Unit is the best thing to come out of the westcoast.I say no to this album...ain't much of a westcoast revival to me. Hopefully some cat will come along with skills and blow these fake thugs out of the game for good. If this is your kinda music though, by all means enjoy...there's more than enough of it to make you happy."
3,He's Overated,This weekend I ran up in circuit city bought the Game album. I was hype I seen all the comercials and the video all the advertisments about this cd. I was very disappointed. The game is very overated I took my time and listened to the cd. He is the weakest member of G Unit. There is nothing about his style that seperates him from an average rapper his lyrics are not outstanding at all. I dont understand where all this hype is coming from. The beats are ok. G unit is fine without him.
5,CLASSIC !!!!!!!!!!!!,"GAME HAS LIVED UP TO THE HYPE WITH THE RELEASE OF ""THE DOCUMENTARY"". THE WEST COAST IS DEFINATELY BACK ON THE MAP. WITH THE PRODUCTIONS FROM KANYE WEST TO DR. DRE TO JUST BLAZE-- EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS STRAIGHT FIRE !!!!! SELLING 700,000 IN ONE WEEK PROVES THAT GAME IS ON TOP OF THE RAP GAME AS WE KNOW IT.TOP 5 TRACKS1) START FROM SCRATCH2) LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON3) THE DOCUMENTARY4) PUT YOU ON THE GAME5) DREAMSA MUST BUY"
4,alright,great debutput u on the game. the documentary and westside story r great songs.people should also check out compton's legends from back in the day *cough* DJ Quik *cough*
2,weak,"hes got a few good tracks happenin, but this isnt a must have..download put it on the game and we ain't..the documentary isn't a classic west coast album by any means, and game is fake..why put out diss records and then say sorry? weeeak"
1,No Game,"why does it take getting shot 5 times for Dr.Dre to get out&Push a Record? I mean first with 50&now the Game. this Cat has no musical Idenity whatsoever.He seems to be riding a wave that got open by 50 Cent. the sad part is that 50 himself did His best material years ago.anyway the Game is just a Name&face to help restore the West Coast in the rap game because there hasn't been a major player in Years.sadly Game is a Step back.you can't recapture what Eazy E,Dre,Snoop,Cube,Quik,MC eiht ,E-40,Too short,etc... did by doing a 2nd hand generic job of it."
1,trash,"[...] I knew this album and song would sky rocket to the top because the fake gangsta, 50 cent is on with him. I dont side with Ja Rule, but when you get shot 9 times and sell records that way, I could care less. Anyone assiocated with 50 or Eminem, you guys are all fake rappers. People will eat the crap out of you ass, but I dont..Dr.Dre started and ruined rap. Its true, just ask me for an explination. The Game sucks, he couldnt get a contract so he went to Eminem and Em gobbled him up and now everyone loves him.....well expect me."
1,shhhhhh,game should just hush he to scared the game is scared to get dissed by jadakiss and fat joe dats y he diss 50 cent
1,i feel like this is just another 50 cent album,"good album over all. only reason 4 that is ...... 50 cent lyrics. if u hav ever heard 50 previous mixtapes u know what im talkin bout. dreams, how we do, hate it or love it,the documentary, higher, life from scracth, and put you on the game were writen partly or compleatly by 50 cent. you can tell even if u havn't heard 50 cent mixtapes and power of the dollar cd because not even young buck and lloyd banks say gggg-unit or just g-unit in their albums as much as game does--50 cent is the only one who really say g-unit like crazy and the fact is that game always talks about his family (g-unit) proof that the documentary is nothing more than a new 50 cent album. on top of that games lyrics r tupacs and biggies lyrics. game needs to be more original! he needs 2 get off 2pac's biggie's 50 cent's dre's and eminem's d*ck. bottom line game sucks he's nothin more than a copy of 2pac and b.i.g. with 50 cent rhymes and lyrics."
2,the nazi tattoo looks fake,"I notice the white academic nerds I know who are into rap music kind of quietly but still so demonstratively are reeeeeeeeeeeeally into the game. personally I think it's kind of a boring rap vocal sound. it's like the democratic party house of representatives meets rap. I'm not racist cause you know I love black girl porn more than anything, but honestly I only listen to white wrappers now. biggie smalls and that fat spic we all liked are dead."
1,sucker!!!,"I liked the album until game showed what a true SUCKER he really is,he aint no gang banger as he says he is fake and not worth the support keep your money and support a real G,cause he aint one, he came in the game beefing now he wants to make friends with people he knew what g-unit was about before he signed with them!!! Game is a SELLOUT!!!"
1,"A joke, this is not music!","The Game is a shame.What a waste. but then again, rap = crap.Oh, I am so sorry, it is not rap, it is 'hip-hop'.Then again, hip-hop is slop."

1,GGGGGGG-UNIT / THe GAMe YOu aint GOne MAke it,This man deserves no stars none at all for this album he wanna go out there wanna be grown wanna act like he can make good music well the tracks on his cd that were jus him was a test n he blew it he aint no gangsta he aint no G hes NO game all he talks about is his shoes all the time.Yuckmouth killed him on the mixtapes and all that as it is now he cant come back wit a good ryme. yo the first time this cd camei got it i was tired of it by the end of the day the only song i was really feeling of the album that wernt getting annoying were hate it or love it and dreams.GAme give it up THe game OVer you finished and when tony yayo come out wit the album and g-unit come out wit that mixtape u thru so man go back to compotob and go back to sleep your records played out lame!
3,The Game - Documentary,"Listened to the album. From a non-biased perspective from a person who grew up listening to rap from 1986-1990 the new york era to the 1991- 1996 west coast era up to now 1999-2005 commercialized era, this new album by ""The Game"" is better than any of the current rap albums out now, but make no mistake, if it were 1994 when gangsta rap was at the forefront with people like spice one, biggie, tupac, scarface, he would be just average and ok. The beats are great and the lyrics are a little above average, but nothing to get you sprung or say woowww!!! like pac used to do. overall a good album but not mindboggling. songs that are noteworthy, ""documentary, higher, like father, westside,"" all the others are ok."
1,Played out (game) before he even began,"Damn, what is it with these G-unit releases? Even if game is not on G-unit anymore, this album still sounds dumb. If anyone who is truly sensible in their music listening just listens to game's lyrics(real hip hop is about lyrics and not just the beat) you will find out just as I did that he raps about nothing significant. All he does is call the names of the last 100 or so significant artists(much better than him) to take up space. Just look as his video for dreams and tell me what you think. This guy won't have much staying power in the rap industry and he will soon be forgotten just like the Sega dreamcast and N64 video gaming systems. Game over and lights out."
1,lamo,"I'm sorry, but this is trash. Its like you can take any retard out of compton who has been shot a few times and make him into a rapper. From 50 cent's tone deaf singing to the Game's incoherent grunts, this album is true bulls**t"
1,Garbage.,"I can't believe how many mind-washed children think The Game is even decent when it comes to rapping. He can't go a verse without mentioning Eazy-E, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., or Dr. Dre, and he's got one of the most boring flows I've ever heard. The Game is one of the reasons people say rap is just 'people talking over a beat,' because that's all Game does. He has no charisma whatsoever, and acts like he's never even seen a dictionary. Documentary? How is this a documentary? How can an album full of name-dropping be considered a story about your life?If you want real hip-hop, and not mainstream garbage, go pick up some Canibus, GZA, or Killah Priest. Avoid this like the plague, and don't just buy it because 'it's the cool thing to do.'"
5,It's Over for G-Unit & G-Unit Records.,"The Nigga is a ""BLOOD"" and supposibly 50 Cent is a ""CRIP"",that's why they beefing now. But enough about that this album is a Masterpiece compared to 2Pac's ""All Eyez on Me"" The Game speaks whats real and whats fake on this one.G-Unit ain't got s*** on him, and right now hes s***ing on all they including Tony Yayo's soft a**, this nigga is weak as f***.\cop this album in stores now (2005)"
1,Wack...I'm going to the Candy Shop,Come take me to the Candy Shop.....cuz this album is very wack....the game is OVER
1,what?,"This album can't be compared with doggystyle.doggystyle started it all.it's the classic of the classics.the documentary isnt close to a classic.and one guy saying that snoop doesnt make gangsta rap anymore.you dont understand nothing about rap because snoop invented gangsta rap and you cant read fool,the albums name is rhythm & GANGSTA.drop it like it's hot its more gangsta than this all cd and the bidness tops it all.snoop rhymes are the best and game no mather what he does cant top it."
1,Hated it,I don't think this was a cd I should have purchased. It didn't meet my expectations. I should have saved my money!
1,Fool,Please game quit the game while is still time do to it.You only get 3 stars because some fool is giving 5 stars with different names because if he didnt do that this cd will be only 2 stars
3,Dissappointing...,With the exception of Dre's tracks The JT the Bigga Figga production on his first album was superior and much more West Coast. Pick it up if you want to hear The Game rapping over West Coast beats.
4,Very Good But...,"It is good, one of my favorite albums. But, it doesnt have that many good tracks on it. Most are average, but his flow is overaverage. The songs that are overaverage are Westside Story, Dreams, Hate It or Love It, How We Do, Put you on the Game, Start from Scratch, and Like Father Like Son. The rest are average. And I just dont think it deserves 5 stars. If you want to hear a great album check out this man named Bossman straight Outta B-More. The album title is Law and Order. He is the best that I have heard. The whole album is hot, all the beats are fantastic. His words are on point. He is better than about 95% of the MC's out now. And since I am from Baltimore I know the fact that no one outside of the city lines knows who he is. It is a shame. Since B-More is in the center of the East coast he has both flavas of the South and the North. So just check this man out."
3,"Rap is OK, Production is Great",Production is great. My lil 12 year old neice would sound good over Game's production. The lyrics are medicore. I gave this album three stars. I probably will love the instrumental version better.
1,sucks,"this album is full of a bunch of bulls***. it's just another bad attempt of bringing back gangsta rap, but at least it's better than 50's album. i wouldn't waste your money on this garbage, go buy 2pac and nas.peace"
5,i love game,"i love this album !!!!!!!!!!! game if you listenin i love you favorrite songs1) start from scratch 2) no more fun and games 3)like father, like son 4)runnin 5)DON'T NEED YOUR LOVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Nothin compared to gangsta rap,Yo game u need to quit this album is horrible man.what the hell happened to dre working with this guys who can't rap like eminem.dre and snoop need to get together again because they are the only ones that can make real gangsta rap.the only thing i see is a guy making reviews with other names and giving 5 stars to the cd.thats bad for amazon.
4,The best..,This could be one of the best CDs to come out this year. This is so much better than 50 cent or banks Cd hands down.
3,"Big ego, full of himself, insults everyone else, what the F?","After i heard How we do, i was hooked by the song, so i bought the album hoping that it will be a good cd. But the first song starts off with ""The Game"" telling the Mexicans, Asians and all other gangs of different races in the West coast to wait for their turn, apprently to be the king of rap or something. this to me is truly not a good way to start off his rap career. the album it self is no way near like a classic cd like he said in his cd bookelet. In the Booklet he thanks Dr Dre and 50 Cent for making him into a legend. WTF? he came out with one cd and most ppls never heard of him, so how is he a legend?? and another thing, he claims his cd is a classic when it just came out, right.... I guess he does not know what humble means since he shows no sign of it in his cd at all! so yeh, dont get his cd, avoid it!"
3,It's OK,"This is alright from game. Being from Long Beach there's alot of hype with game. I got the album when it came out. I didn't see what was great about it. Tight beats but alright flow. Songs like Westside Story, Put you on the Game, How we do, and Hate it or Love It were cool songs. But is this a West Coast Classic. NO far from it. It got the West Coast back on the map but it ain't a classic. IT don't beat All Eyez on Me, THe Chronic, or DoggyStyle. But for the guy that said 50 Cent is a Crip man what you smokin. 50 ain't no Crip, he wishes he was. If he was he might still get respect but he lost all of that. Anyway is game the best rapper now? Probably but wait for Lil Eazy the True Prince of Compton. He gonna slaughter Game."
4,I like,The album is really hot 50 did his thang u could really tell 50 helped i wish game had stayed with G-unit but its koo i guest 50 and Game is coo but yea it's good
4,The Game,"The new Game album is a great album... I mean its no Chronic 2001 or Get Rich or Die Trying but a great debut cd for an up and commer. When you have a cd being produced by the best two producers and rappers themselves, how can you go wrong? Every artist that is guided along by the DR and Slim will be at the top. The Game also has a great voice... First there was Eminem, then 50 then the Game... just another genuis move by the one and only Dr Dre Motherf@%kers"
5,Shady Still DaSHIEET,This has to be one of the hottest albums to come out of ShadyRecords... Game (whoISpart of GUnit) Is da hottest rapper coming out of Cali and anywhere else artists pop out from. The track We Aint..Is 100% BANGINI Suggest You CopThis ... don't bootleg
3,If NAS was a gangsta rapper...,"...you'd get the GAME.He is obviously a very big fan of East Coast rap. Like Gorilla Black, he's good...but his flow is not representative of the westcoast."
5,The Game has Game.,This is by far the best solo album of any of tha G Unit Members. His music is raw and it tells the truth. The Game is the rebirth to the west Coast Rap scene. He is what the west coast has neede sonce they suffered the lose of Eazy E and 2 Pac.
5,great debut,"I have been waitin for this cd for quite some time now and finally got it today. I listened to the whole thing like three times already and I got to say itll prolly be the 2nd best album this year (prolly 2nd to detox). This is one of the few rap cds worth buyin now these days where with the others two or three songs are good and the rest are ear-bleeding. Almost all the songs on hear are great. And for the idiot whos givin 1 star ratings under different names (pretty easy to tell, stupid) please stop"
4,Nice Art Book from paper plates,The book arrived promptly and is was like new just as described. It has an interesting mix of items which can be prepared by using paper plates.
2,Just not satisifed.,It was to complicated for my kids at school. Not what I expected. Not very fun and interesting for our kids.
4,"I'm here for Alan Rickman, but Emily Hampshire is Snowcake's standout","I see other reviewers who start off their review the way I'm going to do it: I'm here because of Alan Rickman. We watch everything he makes, no questions asked. The Amazon review calls him ""morose"" and ""laconic."" Um, yeah. That's Alan Rickman.While I was tempted to call Sigourney Weaver 'annoying' in her role, I realize that that's the entire point - she's portraying a high-functioning autistic and - by all accounts - has done an amazing rendition here.The real star is Emily Hampshire as Weaver's on-screen daughter, Vivienne. She powerfully portrays her character's quirky, fierce but ultimately sweet nature. Why does she single out Rickman for attention as the film opens? As the spotlight review on this page notes, ""Vivienne always picked the loneliest people to talk to."" The truth."
3,Honest-to-God story,This is one of those movies that you want to see because you actually prefer a certain actor and then you end up interested in the story because it is told so well.
4,Fiction is Stranger Than Fact,"This film portrays what can go wrong in people's lives even when they are certain that they have not done anything wrong. Many viewers will have experienced some, if not all, of the feelings portrayed so aptly on the screen by the gifted crew. It is a sobering thought that such mishaps can have an innocent begining."
1,Disappointing,"This movie is an amateurish film that thoughtlessly glamourises everything connected to the real-life struggles and heartaches of families who actually deal with autism. This film is Hollywood's weakly-realised version of 'Autism Lite' which is both distressing and disappointing. Sigourney Weaver makes a valiant attempt to interpret the struggles of a highly-functioning autistic woman as best she can, and a shockingly older Alan Rickman disappoints as the former convict accompanying Weaver's daughter when she dies in a car crash. Rabid fans of Weaver and Rickman will no doubt enjoy this movie for their quasi-hammy, star-turned performances, but Snow Cake simply cannot be recommended to anyone else, especially those who are intimately aware of the realities of this insidious and hearbreaking syndrome."
5,HOT ICE SCREAM,"HOT = Alan Rickman is my favorite actor for more reasons than there is space to write. Having said that, if you have never heard of him, I can promise you that you will be amazed. It must have something to do with his connection in aiding autism awareness. His character has quite alot of baggage, but he still manages to care. Thoughts & Deeds are essential.ICE = Sigourney Weaver's performance in this film is astounding. She makes a real connection by disconnecting. You know that feeling you get when ice stays on your tongue too long? It burns! That's how it is watching her. Cold & hot all at the same time.SCREAM = There are many screams in this film and not all audible. You'll understand if you buy it (or rent it). My internal screaming was what grabbed me with this film. I found myself wrenching in moments of their turmoil & sadness. Then, in the next scene, laughing & elated by the true interaction these actors brought to us through fantastic writing & direction."
4,Enjoy a Delicious Slice,"Snow Cake is an excellent film, with incredible performances from Alan Rickman (Harry Potter Years 1-5, Something the Lord Made) (when are his performances less than stellar?) and a surprising performance from Sigourney Weaver (Infamous, Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)) as an autistic parent.A drama, this film, has an unexpected feel good energy to it. This is only possible due to an excellent script and superb performances from the cast.A different kind of romantic comedy, this is surely a must-see film."
4,The water Nymph,"Very different ! and i was pleased with that fact. it definitely isn't the usual romance but that's why i liked it .. even though the plot was unbelievable, it was fun. the characters were very interesting and a lot of great and funny banter between them. i usually read romances in the realm of catherine coulter, jude deveraux .. each of these author's style is very different .. and now Jaffe is def. on my list .. ...the only other thing i wished it had was more of a relationshipo between the couple.. they hardly talked of stuff other than the murder ..great reading."
4,Another Winner!,"Crispin Foscari, the Earl of Sandal, has 14 days to clear his name as Queen Elizabeth's master spy or be charged with treason. Sophie Champion is investigating the death of the man who was known to the Ton as her godfather. Their paths meet at the feet of a murdered man who may have had information for them both. Now the notorious Earl of Scandal and the mysterious Siren must combine forces to solve the murder or find themselves arrested.Once again, Ms. Jaffe has delivered a rousing adventure in the style of Amanda Quick or Stephanie Laurens. Action, adventure, mystery, romance, and humor can all be found within these pages. And some very erotic love scenes. This book and its predecessor, THE STARGAZER, has whet my appetite for more tales of the Arboretti, particularly Lawrence."
4,A Very Good Romance,As I have said before mysteries drive me nuts. I can't seem to wait to find out who did it. Ms Jaffe is very clever in that she dosen't wait until the very end to reveal the villian. So you can't flip to the end and find out what is going on. I liked this book mush better than the first in the series. I would recommend the book to those who like a good mystery and even those who are looking to a good romance
1,ZZZZZZZZZZ's,"What a boring book! There was no ""Who Done It"" suspense in the story. There was no excitement what so ever. The ""hero"" of this book was a WIMP. My Lord! This was the first book I read of 'Jaffe' and I will say that it is going to be the last. And what is it with this ending?! Blah!"
3,"Slow, but an ok read.","This is the first book I have read by Michele Jaffe and I am not impresed. I am an avid mystery reader and romantic suspense reader, there was suspense (little) and romance, but not enough of mystery and suspense for my taste. I often found myself falling asleep while reading this book, but some parts did have some thrilling moments. If you like slower paced books, then I would suggest that you read this book. I definitely will not read Stargazer at the result of the Water Nymph. This is a good book, and she is a good writer but I do not like slower paced books. Sometimes the characters were not very believeable, and when there was suspense, it went as soon as it came."
3,Pretty Good,"I'll give this author a lot of points for good, taut writing, great steamy sex scenes, and intricate plotting. However, one of the things I take issue with is that her hero strikes me as a tad wimpy and indecisive. In short, he thinks like a not-to-bright romantic heroine, not a hero, and to me, he lacks the edge necessary to make this an excellent romance instead of merely a good one. And while I am willing to suspend disbelief to a large degree, the willingness of the heroine in both this and Jaffe's previous novel to strip naked on some unbelievable pretext almost immediately upon meeting the hero is way too contrived. However, even with these quibbles, I would recommending buying this book; this writer is very good and has the potential to be great, if she disregards her formula and starts to put more tension in her books."
1,0 star!! This book has decreased my IQ,"Gnart, Gnart! I have become retarded. I feel like I have just had a Lobotomy. The pale pink/white matter of my brain is now a putrid brown/green mush. I've forgotten my owm name.Characters? What characters? I think a 10 year old wrote this story. I am so frightened that there are people in the world who could actually read and enjoy all the nonsense in this book.There is no even flow to the story, one minute the characters are doing something and the next they are somewhere else in the room or holding something and you're constantly thinking, ""Where did they get that? Where did that come from?""Ugh, I'm finished..."
2,Reads like an installation guide.,"This book is quite possibly the worst written technical book I have read in my 18 year career. It seems as if the driest and dullest portions of the DB2 manuals have been extracted and collected together and called a book; without any regard to editing or amending with graphics.The material in the book may well cover the necessary topics for the certification test, but the stamina necessary to read it makes this choice clearly a poor one. You would be much better off reading Craig Mullins' latest DB2 Developer's Guide and portions of the DB2 Administration Guide to in preparation for the exams.I give this book 2 stars only because the material covered seems to closely match what is on the test. Extracting the information from this book, however, is another matter."
4,Excellent!,This is a very good book that gives an overall picture of what to expect for the UDB 516 Examination. This book should be used as a guide and detailed study should be made from IBM Manuals.
1,not the one I expected,It doesnt give you the indepth details for the 702 certification... All topics are covered as an overview
4,Not so happy,Pretty good cookie cook book. Great variations on a classic cookie. I wish it had more photos though. The mocha cookies are really good.
5,Neither Tara nor Jasmine Here,"Aiken's examination of the restructuring of settlement in the cotton plantation South from the Civil War to contemporary times captures the complexities of this region's transformation. In three sections he establishes the post Civil War fragmentation of the plantation as tenancy dominates the region, the twentieth century exodus, and finally the contemporary pattern reflecting the changing social and economic structure of the region. Examining the postcolonial explanation for these changes, he opts for a more realistic combination of Faulknerian human failings and failures. Winner of the J B Jackson prize from the Association of American Georgraphers, this book is the culmination of a mature scholar's life work."
2,Gross!,If you use it at the strength they recommend. YUK!!!!! Almost okay if you make it 1/4 strength. Better off taking the pills.
3,Product not as advertised,I am on the second bag of tea and as an example I was awakened 4 times last night to go to the bathroom. I am continueind to use the product to determine if eventally I will be able to sleep through the night without more than two trips to the bathroom.
4,It was great news for my husband,"My husband had been getting up multiple times a night. As I was getting such great results from the Bell's Bladder tea, I got him some Ezee Flow Tea and it cut his nightime visits to the bathroom down to just one or two."
1,Didn't Help,"My husband had high hopes when he saw an ad for this product, but like most everything else he's tried, it didn't alleviate his symptoms at all. He said it didn't taste very good either."
4,Effective,"My husband had positive results with this product.He says it is not a cure all, but given the alternative of expensive drugs (which he has also taken in the past)he finds it to be a practical non evasive approach. If you don't like tea he would not recommend it. He enjoys it with a little honey and finds that it also settles his stomach."
1,Did not work and may have contributed unwanted side effects,"I tried Bell's Prostate Tea for about two weeks and did not experience any of the expected improvements, though I realize it may have been too soon to see any benefits. However, after those two weeks my digestive system was completely out of whack, with major intestinal cramps, constipation, nausea, you name it. Now, two weeks after discontinuing Bell's I am now back to normal. Could it have been a coincidence, and maybe it was really a stomach virus? Maybe, but it was unpleasant enough that I won't try the tea again. Nothing scientific about my experiences, so try it if you'd like - just be wary of similar side effects."
5,Bible for Network flows,Go for it! Other books do give algorithms but some of them have sloopy versions of the algorithms. This book not only gives the efficient versions of algorithms but also gives pseudo code for all of them. And the treatment of the subject itself is flawless. The theory leading to algorithms is very important to understand the algorithms and the authors do an excellent job. The way the book is organised the pictures and examples - everything is perfect. The exercises are not just number crunching problems but real good problems which require lot of thinking.
2,Lettering not as pictured,"Received this apron with the old block ""VIKINGS"" lettering and expected the apron as pictured with the script lettering. Returned it for possible correction."
2,Not what I expected,"As good as any other apron. What I did not like was that it only has the Viking logo. It doesn't say ""VIKINGS"" and so it looks a little empty without it"
1,does not work,"My daughter received this as a gift, after she had removed the packaging, which was thrown away at Christmas, we headed home and realized that it does not work, and now we are unable to return it. Bum deal!!!"
4,Only problem - it isn't long enough!,"Thoughtful, down to earth commentary - good help for reading the psalms while enmeshed in every day life. Helps make the psalms one's ""everyday"" prayers."
2,Did not work,Unfortunately this DVD did not work. I do not know if it was due to the age of the tv show or just a bad DVD but I was unable to watch the voice did not work it would stop and start.
5,"Sombre, thoughtful and more mature","Blof have been one of Holland's leading groups for several years, characterized by bouncing rock with a raunchy vocal and telling -- almost poetic -- lyrics. This latest album looks at a more serious, sadder world and brings a much more polished, almost morose, but shining album. Dichterbij dan ooit -- closer than ever -- has to be one of the best up-beat love songs ever; if you can't sit still for a Bruce Springsteen song then this will definitely get you on your feet. Mooie dag -- lovely day -- is a real goosebumps song, lilting classical guitar over an electric reverb ... close your eyes and let this ballad sweep you away.Take the trouble to find a translation of the lyrics, you won't be disappointed! An excellent album."
3,heart of the pocassets,"Weetamoo is a girl from 1653 and she is a pretty average teenager. She has to travel from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. With her family and village, They make it. The problem isthat Weetamoo had to suffer harsh cold, feets of snow winters. Very hot summers. All as well as doing all her chores.If you like diaries and stories of Native Americans. You will for sure like this book."
4,great book,This is a great book it took me a week to find a copy but I found one. I wait eagrly for the revised edition to come out.
3,Weetamoo,"Weetamoo is the inspiring story of a young Native American girl who strives to become a woman and for patience. The beginning starts out kind of slow, and it's hard to get into. But if you keep reading then you really get into it. It was interesting to see the way she changed throughout the diary. It was also interesting to find out the way the authour took a real historical character and turned her into a fictional one. Her true life story is really tragic, and so is the end of the book. It depends on your age weather I'd recommend it or not. It can be a little childish and too easy to read at times. Other than that, it's a great story!"
4,Good Place to Start,"Although I am not new to Yoga, I still consider myself a beginner. I purchased this product after reading some of the reviews, and I must say that I was not dissapointed. Shiva is an amazing instructor, her soothing voice is clear and leads well through the asanas. The scenes on the video are beautiful and soothing. The best feature of this product is the matrix that can be used to customize your own personal routine. I have used this feature plenty of times and it has kept my practice fresh and challenging. Overall, I strongly recommend this product for anyone who is thinking about starting a yoga practice as well as an accomplished practicioner."
3,O.K.,Definetely not a video for beginners or hypermobile injured individuals. I found that she moved too quickly and may not advise enough through the more flexible postures. While I am very flexible and have had a few years of yoga practice I had to be very careful myself so as to not overstretch when recovering from an injury.
5,Problems with DVD,"Oh how I'm dying to be able to experience Yoga Shakti but my DVD has a glitch in it. When I try to go into the vinyasa flows or the matrix the DVD becomes incompatible with my DVD player. However, the Introduction for disk 1 is fine and disk 2 is also fine. I have already returned this once and the second one is doing the same thing. Is anyone else experiencing this problem? I'm still giving this five stars because I know that Shiva Rea is awesome and that this is only a technical problem."
3,beginners beware!!,"unless you practice for at least 10 years and your age is below 30 , you cannot follow this very decorative lessons, but if you fit the criteria abowe, it fits you like a glowe."
1,"Nice Atmosphere, but...","Personally, I wouldn't recommend this particular DVD to anyone with spinal issues. Otherwise it's a fun program. It does have the effect of making me want to go to the beach right now."
1,If you are a serious about yoga teaching or your own practice...,"Avoid anything by Shiva Rea, Queen of the Trance Dance. She is not practicing yoga. She is doing some crazy rendition with yoga pose names, but it is not what yoga is all about. I recommend avoiding anything she has her name on. You'd be better off spending your money on something by Yoga Journal or finding a teacher in your community."
2,Its great...for Shiva Rhea,"It says in the info that the DVD caters to all skill levels. NOT TRUE! This is not a DVD for yoga beginners, this is one for someone who has been doing yoga for years and knows the poses. I'm a beginner and I couldn't do even a 1/4 of what is on the DVD. Shiva Rhea can do the poses, yay or her. Not yay for a beginner. She doesn't describe the poses, only says ""place your feet here and hands here"". And the way she was acting while doing this reminds me of someone who is stoned out of their mind.This DVD is NOT for beginners, no matter what the DVD Info section says."
1,Shiva Rea Yoga Shakti,"Not Great for Beginners,The package is too cumbersome to play.I would not recommend others"
2,Keep looking,"Difficult to follow, not kind on your lower back. Prepare to have to watch before you do it as she doesn't talk you through anything. NOT RECOMMENDED for beginners, you could hurt yourself on this tape."
5,Use the Matrix,"This is a great yoga DVD. It works for both beginners and more advanced students. The trick is to watch (even in fast forward) each program and ""mix and match,"" using the matrix, according to your level of experience. What makes this DVD work is that it changes as you grow; you can create new practices as your experience and skill increase. The beginner's practice is very easy, for example, but can be modified using the matrix to include, e.g. one or more of the ""Dancing Warrior"" sequences. The sun salutations also offer several options appropriate for either beginners or intermediates. You need to take the time to view each practice and find what's right for you. This DVD and the Rodney Yee DVDs will be the mainstays of my yoga DVD library, including my travel library. I also like the fact that it's not slick, but rather put together by real practitioners. Go for it!"
2,Didn't like this DVD,"I found this DVD to be too fast moving. There was not enough time to look at the screen, do the action, get the movement correct and understand the benefit from the exercise. It was filmed in a great location but it is to condensed to really enjoy."
5,Amazing DVD!!,"This is by far one of the best yoga DVD's I have ever purchased. There are 4 workouts in one dvd. Also, it's interactive and you can create your own yoga practice. I would recommend this to anyone who loves yoga. It's a great DVD to own and wonderful for all levels.Yoga Shakti"
5,excellent dvd!,This program is far beyond my expectations. It is unique in that you can customize your practice. There are so many possible combinations. I love having that capability when I can't make it to my yoga class. I highly recommend this dvd!
4,Variety of Options!,This DVD is wonderful! It has such a variety of options that it is appropriate for nearly all levels of practitioners. My only complaint is that there are so many options that it is difficult to choose!
5,Yoga dvd,This is the best yoga dvd that I own. Being able to program your practice from the matrix as well as choose from pre-programmed practices is the best thing ever. The music is also some of the most pleasant I have heard on any of my yoga dvds as well.
4,Worth it,"Challenging, Intermediate level. Love the matrix that allows me to pick & choose. Only drawback - Lots of hand stand-ish poses which I find very difficult."
2,This DVD is for watching not for following,"This DVD is not for me.I bought this DVD due to all those good reviews, but I was really disappointed. If you like watching Yoga show, then this is for you. If you are looking for a Yoga course to follow, then definitely do not get this one.People who like this DVD must be very experienced at Yoga, else how can they follow the pace and moves?"
2,Yoga Shakti,"I expected a full practice without pauses, but the full 1hr practices just combines the shorter matrix versions, so as soon as you get started and into it, it stops and goes to next matrix. I just want to do sun salutations for 15min or so to get into the groove. Too much talking for me but then again some people who are not really used to dropping down to the level of the body or emotional state might enjoy this. Shiva can guide to you to those places.I just want to move and then talk. I still go to baron baptise for simple power vinyasa with alignment cues. Shiva is more into the state of the pose and the ""energy"" etc then the physical alignment."
1,the un-yoga,"I tried to love it, but this dvd had nothing for me. The sequences are boring and then impossible and back to boring. Which is a great argument for building up to a pose, which never happens in all the sequences. Not that it matters because none of the poses are held, so the physical challenge of the poses are always very limited. And to top it all off, the switching of scenes after each sequence is distracting and obnoxious. Don't waste your money. If you want a challenging practice that builds strength and awareness, forget Shakti and go get something by Rodney Yee."
5,Complete Yoga DVD,"This DVD is perfect for the long-time yoga practitioner who knows his/her limits and is looking to push them. The matrix also can help extend the use-life of the DVD, but after owning the DVD for a month and using the DVD 8 times, I can confidently say I'm still another 10-15 times away from using the matrix as Shiva's pre-set routines are nicely ordered. The one downside to the DVD is the matrix does not tell you how long each routine is, which is a driving factor for a lot of my mid-week practices. Also, the dvd moves quickly from chapter to chapter which is good for an advanced user, but requires some pausing for the less inexperienced user."
5,My favorite!,"I love Shiva Rea yoga! The matrix is a great option always but this specific set of practices is by far my favorite of any of the Shiva Rea DVD's. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
5,One of my favorites.,"I love this DVD, but maybe I am a little biased these days, because I am loving everything by Shiva Rea. The yoga is challenging, which is how I like it. It gives me something to work at. Much better for intermediate or advanced students, but beginners can learn a lot by doing the routines over and over again.... It doesn't get boring... You just need to get the flow..."
5,Great Yoga CD!,Contains various yoga routines you can perform and/or matrices you can use to build your own individual workout.
3,Moves way too slow,"As a firm believer in weight training with heavy weights, I only started doing yoga when it was part of the P90X programs a few years ago....LOVED the results adding in yoga did for me!!! So, I used the Yoga DVD on the P90X until I plateaued then I movedinto a Yoga DVD with a Yogi named Bryan Kest, that DVD is for sale on here on Amazon and has 3 levels/workouts on it....Highly Reccommend purchasing that one over this Yoga Shakti DVD if you want a yoga workout that is done in about 40 min and leaves you feeling Great....this one just moves waaaayyyyy to slow for us who only havE a limited time for workouts each day, not nearly enough different poses by the time 30 min is gone."
5,fabulous--almost like attending class,"wonderful, professionally done yoga video done by an experienced teacher. I go to yoga daily and if I can't make it this DVD takes the place of it. I wish the night routine was shorter because I usually do it at the end of the day when I have already done a morning workout. Easy to fast forward though..."
3,"ok, so am i the only one that doesnt know all poses in sanskrit",it was so frustrating to me i resold it on amazon the next month. I like vinyasa flow and like to keep up a certain pace also to maintain some sort of workout along with the yogic benefits but not knowing the sanskrit names for all the poses i had to keep stopping and looking which defeated the entire process.
3,"Impressed, with the format flexibility",I have purchased quite a few yoga DVDs in the past; and this is the first one to use the DVD technology available to allow the user to create the exercise program to suit.And for that alone; way to go.!!!!!!
2,I do sorta like it,Shiva Rea's yoga is more like yoga porn. She's very sensuous and the movements are beautiful to watch but to try to follow as a real practice one must have a dance background. If you are beginning or intermediate in your practice you won't like this. I teach yoga and I didn't really like it.
3,Not for me,"I purchased this yoga DVD because it had such great reviews on several fitness sites & Amazon. It is beautifully produced, however, I just did not like it. I think perhaps a more experienced yogi would get more out of it but as a beginner I just felt lost. Maybe once I become more experienced with different poses I'll revisit this DVD."
2,A little disappointed,"As someone that has practiced yoga for a couple of years, I found this DVD set to be a let down. Since Shiva refers to the poses in non-English terms, I found that I never knew what she was doing unless I kept watching the TV which is really hard in some poses. I was always lagging behind. I tried reviewing the discs since it was said to have an ""instruction"" portion. This only showed a few minutes of one or two poses. For someone that knows the names of the poses this disc may be ok. It will collect dust on my shelf until a time (if ever) that I learn what the poses are called. This is definitely NOT a beginner DVD as advertised. Although I do not consider myself a true beginner and know most poses in their English names, I had a hard time. I will now order one from Yodney Yee or Patricia Walden who guides you along and tells you exactly how to align your body and prevent injury."
4,Love Shiva!,"She's a beautiful and inspirational yoga teacher who's been around for a while now; however, she still seems like a new concept. This dvd may not be for the beginner yogi, but highly recommend it! TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION"
5,The Best Yoga dvd EVER!,I have been practicing yoga since 1994 and teaching since 2000. This is the best dvd I have ever come across. It has completely changed the way I practice and teach. Totally inspiring. No matter if you're a beginner or more experienced - everyone can bebfits from this dvd. And the extra features on the 2nd dvd are very educational and beautiful. Look no further...this is THE ONE to get!
5,...from a true Shivagini...,"As a Vinyasa yogini teacher and student of Shiva - this yoga DVD tops them all. Shiva is an unbelievably beautiful soul with an energetic heart. I use this video, suggest it to my students and give it as gifts!"
4,Vinyasa Flow Sequences for Mid-level Yogis,"Shiva's vinyasa flows in this video are of medium difficulty. There are four practices in total, each containing its own set of sequences. The sequences each focus on a specific body part, thereby allowing the viewer to pick and choose the course. Every practice is conducted in a manner true to any dedicated practitioner - mediation, dedication of practice, the practice itself and finally, savasana. Soothing instrumental music accompanies Shiva's verbal instructions on positions along with her guidance on breathing, which combine to build a rigorous workout."
5,Siva Rea - Yoga Shakti,Excellent DVD. I have not been doing yoga for too long and some movements are too fast for me for now but the DVD allows me to arrange my own sequence which is nice.
5,AWESOME FLOW!!,I love being able to customize the time that I have to do yoga. I found this to be a great flow and challenging. I have done this DVD several times and still not at all bored. GREAT MONEY SPENT!
2,Not Really For Beginners,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be a very easy to use beginner yoga workout. It really isn't. In order to do this workout, you really need to know how to do the poses already. There is very little instruction. I found she switched poses too quickly and I couldn't keep up. The recommended workouts ranged from approximately 45 to 90 minutes and I really don't have the time for a workout that long. You can put together your own workout using the matrix, but having very little knowledge of the types of yoga and the poses, I could not create a workout that worked for me.I have to admit, the scenery was beautiful."
3,Not one of my favorites,"This is a great DVD if you are looking for exercises/short meditations instead of a flowing sequence. I felt that the ""matrix"" was too choppy since there are wait times between the poses.I have other yoga DVDs I will pick before this, but I will use some of the exercises for a pointed work out occasionally."
4,Great book to read to your little robot lovers!,"We finished reading The Forgotten Door and are now in the midst of Runaway robot. I can hardly stand to put it down myself....the kids beg for ""One more chapter, PLEASE!"" every time my husband finishes reading one aloud."
2,"Not bad, not great","There are very few books of this sort around, so if you're into the medium of bodypainting, it's a keeper. But I found it wanting in several areas. Some of the painting jobs are quite good, others (including the cover shot) are not particularly well-done. The photography and modeling are adequate but uninspired-- they all seem to be taken with the same lighting, from the same angle, with the same attitude. The images themselves appear to be story illustrations or ad art, and many don't stand up too well out of context. In short, it's a book of commercial art images of attractive nudes with stuff painted on them. If that's your bag, this is your book."
2,"The first word that comes to mind is ""uneven"".","I've always been fond of body art (""Painted Bodies"", edited by Roberto Edwards, is spectacular) but this book, a relative handful of photographs capped with a page or two of one-line comments, barely bounced on my coffee-table on its way to well-deserved obscurity... the overall visual sensibility is derivative of ""Penthouse"", except with subpar photography. It was not a complete disappointment - the best images are very good, and almost worth the price of admission - but the overall effect is not quite what it should have been. Most of the author's effort clearly went into the painting: it is imaginative and well-executed (with several rather sophomoric misses), but the combination of wooden models (albeit with a few welcome exceptions) and a photographic obsession with poorly-lit faceless torsos makes the painting a mostly wasted effort."
5,improves my workouts,I have better workouts with taking this. No more post and pre work out joint pain. No more restrictions on my weights from pain.
5,"a very good story, entertaining book to read","opposingly to the other people who reviewed this book, i don't feel something is missing or that absolutely everything should be explained in details. Use your imagination for god's sake! The character of the serial killer is very bright, very clever and therefore knew how to act and when to do it. Where's the big problem in all this?!? Judith Kelman, as Mary Higgins Clark herself said, is excellent at what she's doing. I'm happy she finally get published in europe!"
3,Something missing.,"""One Last Kiss"" left me wondering how the murderer set up all the ""scenes"", comitted all the murders, knew just what time to murder and conducted a business. Too many things ""happened"" with no explanation of how. I will read Judith Kelman, I like her style of writing. This one left something missing for me."
5,Straub Soars!,"Peter Straub doesn't just tell a story...he pulls you into his mind and lets you live it. He is the absolute king of the supernatural thriller, a genre he may have created (as far as I can tell).I got a bit of flak from my dean when I said I was going to include Straub in my American Lit class. Then I challenged him to read the man's work before judging based solely on a ""genre"". Let's just say I won that bet.If you haven't read Straub yet...then go do yourself a favor. Start with Ghost Story and keep going."
3,Nothing to write home about,"I don't think I can give a fair review of the book because some inconsiderate Amazon ""reviewer"" ruined the story for me by placing some major plot spoiling information in their ""review""."
1,Not good at all,"I honestly don't understand why anyone would consider the plot of this book to be a good one. I thought it was actually silly, without any credibility and filled with poorly written dialogues. Around 2/3 of the book I just didn't care about what would happen in the end and stopped reading. I have never felt the slightest desire to pick it up again to finish it."
3,Okay Story,"This was my first Peter Straub read. I thought the story was okay, not quite up to par with what I've heard about his books."
1,LSD is easier to understand,"Like Annie, I found this book a huge disappointment. Unlike her, I decided not to finish it -- why waste my time? This author must have been on serious drugs in order to write such tripe. One shouldn't have to work so hard when reading a book for pleasure. As a fan of Stephen King's first few books, I quite reading him when he got as weird as Peter Straub. I can see why they're friends."
1,dead tree,ink on paper = dead treeink on paper = moneydo not spend your dead trees on this dead treeif you find it at your library put it back on the shelf
3,Stunningly original ideas,"I picked up the unabridged audio book of this at the library, inspired to get some more from the author of the Talisman. I had no idea what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. I really love the idea proposed in this book that all books have a ""perfect"" version, whether their author fully realizes it or not. That there are a very few of these version printed from some kind of unknown supernatural publisher. I loved that idea! Unfortunately this book seems to suffer from the unfully realized book syndrome. it seems like he didn't quite know where to go after he took us through most of the story, and there is a very thin ending which did not satisfy. Overall good writing though, i will definately be checking out more by him in the future."
1,Don't Bother!,"This book was AWFUL. The worst part is that I hung in there until the very end, for some reason thinking that it would pull together into a good story. But it was a bad joke, and poorly written at that. The author appears to have some uncanny talent for writing about incredible things by sucking the life out of them until they are not emotionally moving in the least. The characters were poorly developed and unlikable. The references to mIRC and ""haXXors"" were just plain STUPID. I could perhaps see the story appealing to a preteen, but there's too much inappropriate X-rated trash in this book for that to be a good thing."
2,GREAT TITLE..AND THAT'S IT,"""It was OK"" is the most damning-with-faint-praise expression I can think of for a book like this. It's an adequate read, but who has time for adequate reads? Straub has his pet themes like all writers, but unlike most seems happy to just riff on the same notes, over and over and over. I particularly hate his portrayal of women: they're either beautiful, winsome, perfect creatures (we know this because he tells us, they actually come across as needy and childish) or they're the staff. Ick."
2,Mostly disappointeted,"Actually this book deserves 2 1/2 stars. It wasn't that bad, it just wasn't good."
4,PETER STRAUB,CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHAT DOES THE NAME OF THE ANGEL? It is a word without vowels. What does it mean?
4,In the Night Room,"I liked the novel, but it had the problem that sequels often do: a failure to adequately provide info on the first novel, thereby creating confusion"
5,"good reviews, bad reviews","the book store was very prompt and I had delivery way before the time frame they gave me. Excellent! The book was fun, funny and in some ways sad. Sad that someone felt they had to write a book to open our eyes to how badly people behave without thinking about consequences. Of course it was written by a wonderfully intellegent, funny woman who put it out there and got her point across without being nasty. A enjoyable book."
4,Whenever I need a laugh,I pick up this book and re- read the first chapter! I have never actually lol (laUGHED OUT LOUD) WHEN READING TO MYSELF UNTILL THIS BOOK CAME ALONG. wHOOP IS A FAVORITE OF MINE AND book IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS COMEDIAN IS STILL POPULAR AFTER ALL THESE YEARSI still havent made it all the way through this book- not a good sign- but that first chapter is worth the entire price of the book!
5,Very funny!,I read this book in one day while flying from Washington DC to Boston. It made me laugh and think about the world we live in. Whoopi please write another book! I so enjoyed this one! The Wind chapter is the best!
2,Beneath her considerable Talents...,"This book was about Whoopi Goldberg's opinion on various things. It was non-fiction. Though I agreed with many of the ideas presented in this book, I found it to be adolescent. Whoopi was trying too hard to be down to earth and frankly, ended up sounding juvenile. I like her, I think she has the ability to see things others do not, but I think this book was dumb and beneath her intelligence and wit."
3,"Short, funny read","Whoopi shares her views on life and gets down to the nitty gritty of things, including bodily functions. The writing perfectly captures her tone and her voice. She sounds amazingly serious and straight-faced when she discusses farting, something that no movie star of her stature would dare discuss, but Whoopi tackles the topic with her usual aplomb and humor. Personally, I would like Whoopi to write a more extensive autobiography so we could learn more about her life and her struggle as a single welfare mother, and how she made it to the top in backstabbing, ""Beautiful People"" Hollywood. She must have an interesting life story to tell. This book only gives you a peek into the woman behind Whoopi, as it's very short but entertaining, especially if you're a Whoopi fan."
5,Whoopi's book cuts to the heart of every issue in life!,"I laughed, I cried , I got goosebumps over and over again. Her down to earth words made so much sense. I picked this book up on a whim, because I thought I could probably get a few laughs on my lunch hour. I was not prepared for the way it made me feel. My emotions ran the gamut. Thank you Whoopi, for putting it all into perspective. Everything that I have been feeling for so long, but could never find the voice. Definetly a must read!!!!!"
4,Laughing to death!,"I was laughing so much that people on the train were staring at me. If you like Whoopi, you will like this book. There are serious parts to it but it was trully her. Granted I do know a couple things about her now that I could have gone my whole life without knowing but, it was a great read."
4,getting inside the head of a great actress/comedienne,"whoopie is one of my favourite actresses and comedienne's. she's got a very blunt attitude about life, and doesn't have any problem telling you how it is. this book covers all kinds of topics from farts, to sex. you'll even find out why her nickname/name is whoopie :) again, another book written as if she is standing there talking to you, so don't expect perfect grammar, or sometimes even for it to flow like a novel, because that's not what it's about. it's about her telling stories, and telling you her opinions and thoughts on things about our lives.....that's what makes it so much fun, to see what she's thinking, and what makes her such a funny person...."
1,God help us all.,"This book is so bad it defies description. I was amazed how poorly written and nonsensical it is. While I agree with many of her opinions, I lost alot of respect for her from the poor quality of this book."
2,A very disappointing book.,"The frequent use of swearwords is what annoyed me the most during my highly anticipated read. Profanity just does not look attractive on paper, it's so unappealing. Most importantly, I hardly found any good humor in it. I felt totally comically unrelieved. There goes my hero. The title of the book explains what it actually is, just another book, nothing more or less."
2,"This book is horrible, it is boring and badly written","I was extremely excited to buy this book, that is until I read it. Whoopi rambles too much and some of her sterotype comments are just plain stupid. I have truely lost some of my respect for her now that I have read this book."
1,Absolute rubbish! Don't waste your time!,"She has nothing of significance to say, and it's not funny at all. She has substituted vulgarity for humor and she just rambles on about the most inane topics."
1,Drivel from an angry person,Whoopie's comment against Pope John Paul II is so hateful and obscene that it defies all decency and shows what really motivates her.
4,"Goldberg is hilarious, but lacks substance","Whoopi Goldberg, an exceptionally talented actor and comedian, should be commended for putting her humor in words for her debut book, cleverly titled ""Book."" Goldberg tackles issues as seemingly mundane as using the bathroom to more serious issues as the love of a family member, while conveying a sense of personality and humor quite effectively.Although each chapter is hilarious in its own right, the excessively large print and skipping of pages between chapters, while seemingly unimportant, makes it seem as though ""Book"" is trying to be more substantial than it really is."
1,AAAAARGH!,This is by far the biggest waste of trees. That this book made it to the NYT Best seller list is the surest sign the the end of civilization is near. Garbage.
5,"For paininting, this works!","Really one of the best. I have 300 books (plus, oh my gosh), but this is the BEST book for impressionistic painting."
3,Insufficient impressionistic Monet's documentation,"In general it is good reading and I have learnt something from it besides enjoyment. In my opinion it lacks certain important references to the Master of impressionism i.e. Claude Monet. When an author selects impressionism as his subject, in my opinion it is very important to have some of Monet's best pictures documented in a profound technical way. This is important not to confuse between impressionism and expressionism."
2,What a disappointment,"I hate to give anyone a bad review, but the best thing about this book is the cover. I have gone through this book several times, and I really cannot understand the high rating of the other reviews. Lois Griffel is NOT a painter and apparently has never taken a lesson in perspective. I am guessing that she has had all her former students write glowing reviews for her. The best paintings in the book are by other artists. If you really want to know how to paint in the impressonistic style, visit a museum or look at some paintings by Monet or Manet. The exercises in the book are just directing the artist to paint boring pictures of white blocks and forms. ""See the color."" This is your local art guild stuff and, if you have any talent at all, this book will NOT improve or add to your current skills. Check out McPhearson for some real instruction in impressionist landscape painting. If anyone wants to buy this book cheap, please contact me."
3,"Lost of Pretty Pictures, but...","...very few helpful tips. Griffel's paintings are good, and so are the works of the other painters she has chosen. That's what this book is about, the works by griffel et al; do not expect much instruction."
4,Excellent,"Book in fine shape, on time and as anticipated. Thanks for the prompt service. Have read it through yet but appears to be the info I was looking for."
5,Excpetional Book,"I have read quite a few books on drawing and painting. Few other painting books that have actually excited me enough to do the exercises! This one is exceptional: well-written, beautifully illustrated (especially with the author's paintings), clear exercises presented in a well thought-out and detailed manner. If you like color, like I do, this is the book for you. I learned a great deal about the impressionist use of color, how to create atmosphere in a painting, light and shadow, and other important elements related to painting plein air."
3,"American Impressionism, not French/European","While a useful read, with techniques well explained, several good exercises and very well illustrated, this book is firmly in the field of American Impressionism, not French. If you are primarily interested in the techniques of French Impressionism, this is not the book for you."
5,Sencillo y facil de aplicar,"Realmente me parece un plan, sencillo de aplicar, requiere disciplina como todo en la vida. El plan se ajusta a las condiciones de cualquier persona, no importando su situación actual."
4,Un excelente estilo de vida a seguir,"Aunque muchas situaciones del libro no se aplica en mi país (Venezuela) recomiendo ampliamente la lectura. Es bueno aplicarlo en el día a día de cada persona, incluyendome."
4,Pippi Wormed Her Way Into My Heart.,"Pippi Longstocking is every parent's nightmare. She is rude, manner less, uncouth, and loud. However, she is also full of soul, caring, generous, and loving. I have to give this movie two thumbs up for worming its way into my heart.I watched this classic over and over as a child, and knew that I had to see it again. I didn't necessarily remember the voice overs the first time around. They are quite distracting, but I can understand why there were no subtitles.Nonetheless, this DVD would be a great addition to any child's repertoire."
5,pippi!,"This is a great movie, tons of fun and memories for myself,I bought this movie for my granddaughters they love it as much as I do! A must have if your a pippI fan!"
5,Love it,My daughter feel in love with this movie on Netflix a year ago and she wantsit so bad for Christmas this year. I can remember watching it as a child and loving it myself. I'm so glad that Amazon had it! She is going to be so excited Christmas morning when she opens it.
1,pippi,"The movie was not what I really thought it was. I was looking for the pippi longstocking show that I watched on tv as a child and this movie was nothing like that.I hope I can find that show,so that I can let my daughter watch it."
2,Not pleased,"Pippi Longstocking by Inger Nilsson, Maria Persson, Pär SundbergThis movie was not what I was expecting. It is very obvious that this movie was originally done in another language & was ""dubbed"" in order to put it into english. Once I realized that I had ordered the wrong movie, I, of course, was unable to return it because it had been opened. I ended up ordering the one that I was originally seeking & I am very please with that one. My children watched the movie constantly as children & now, as adults, wanted to see it again, I purchased it as a surprise for them. They were happy when their ""original"" one arrived in the mail from Amazon. I would not recommend this one as a purchase."
1,Never agin,Terrible service. Had to email twice to check order and when it arrived it was only two tapes and not 2 4-pack!!!!
1,Failed immediately,"This item stopped working the instant I plugged a second socket into it, and is now junk. At least it was so low in cost that it isn't worth paying shipping to return. Stay away from this item."
4,Not exactly as pictured,"One of the reasons I choose this was the pictured coiled power cord, instead you get the everyday ordinary thin wire cable.Other than that it gets the job done."
3,"Works well, but not for everyone",Fits perfectly in the cupholder. Unfortunately it will blow your fuse if too many things are plugged in at one time.
1,great concept..awful product,"the product arrived quickly in great condition..however only one week after using the product(awesome concept and was able to multi task)it got stuck in the adapter socket. After finally pulling it out days later, half of it got stuck in the adapter slot and i had to take it to the shop to get it out without breaking my adapter socket...so the product worked for all of a week..buyer beware...awesome concept, cheap product or design"
5,MOST INTERESTING..........,"ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION IS THAT IT ENABLES ME TO RE-LIVE MY CHILDHOOD. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THESE TIMLESS EPISODES OF ""SUPER CAR"". IN MY YOUTH, THE 50'S AND 60'S, I NEVER DREAMED I WOULD EVER SEE TV SHOWS LIKE THIS AGAIN. SUPER CAR'S PLOTS AND DIALOG ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND INVOLVES ""REAL"" SCIENCE; NOT THE PUESDO SCIENCE OF STAR TREK. ""SUPER CAR"" WASN'T CREATED BY A MARKET STUDY, IT WAS ART; A LOVING DEVOTION. I THINK MY NEWPHEW WILL FIND SUPER CAR MOST, MOST INTERESTING...."
4,nice cut but wish there was a spring action to open the cutter.,I use this for cutting hoses for water cooling systems. it cuts nice just be careful not too close to the edge of the hose. the cutter wont grip the hose and you will end up w a bent cut. (give yourself about a 1/2 inch) only problem I have with this cutter is that it doesn't spring open when you unlock it. So you have to use both hands to open the cutter then cut it. minor problem but still it gets annoying.
5,soft syringe,"I have not used it yet, but bought it for when my poor cat needs to take oral liquid meds due to her gum disease. All the others I have tried are hard and hurt."
4,Inappropriate for young children,"Inappropriate for young children. A reveiwer ""christian mom"" details some of the content of the book. It is good historical fiction as other reviewers point out eloquently but please review chapter 8 in particular before giving to your daughter or be faced with lots of uncomfortable questions as I was. Good for older kids. Being historical fiction, the N word is used a lot as would be expected. Lots of romantic things which might appeal to young girls but not necc to fathers. There is plenty that can offend, but the book itself is otherwise good at the right time."
3,The War Within,"The story is set during the Civil War however the title is just what is implies. It is the protagonist's civil war. Here we have a young independent fourteen girl that must become a woman. The war takes her father away from home and there is a crisis that takes her mother away. Evvy is left to manage things. She learns several family secrets that she must come to terms with. It is a fast moving story from a very young but woman's viewpoint. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
3,A tad wishy-washy.,"""Evvy's Civil War"" has been on my ""to read list"" for many years, and I greatly anticipated it. Sadly, it was not what I expected it to be. The premise behind it was grabbing, and the possibility of family secrets is always an interesting one, but the writing style used by Miriam Brenaman was very hidden. I always felt like I was missing something, and that the concealed information between the characters were also that way with the reader. I did find the story with the slaves (their genealogy, rather) and the Quakers to be more interesting. This story is engaging, but not overly historical. I ""sorta"" recommend."
2,Poorly done fiction,"As much as I did enjoy Evvy and her Quaker cousins and did realize that every person throughout all of history has been an individual, this was a poorly done book. For starters, I had a hard time believing Quakers would be so open about sex. Secondly, Evvy was very liberal- far too liberal to be a believable historical character. I like heroines to be independent and strong willed, but one must be realistic when dealing with historical fiction. But do read this- it IS absorbing."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE BOOK,"I have not received the book, ""Sisters in the Struggle"" Please credit my account."
3,Kindle Transfer Review,"Other reviewers have done a good job of reviewing the story itself, so I just have a few comments on the Kindle transfer. It's pretty dreadful. I've read a goodly number of free Kindle books now and am used to the usual errors, but this book actually repeats about 10 pages in the middle. I've never seen that before. In addition to that, there are many more spelling/word errors than the average free Kindle book.If you don't mind the errors and the 10 pages repeated then this is a good (free) read, but if you're distracted by these things I'd recommend buying a hardcopy of this book."
3,"Call this one, Fu Manchu Light","I'm only giving this one three stars. Overall, if I had never read any of the Fu Manchu stories, I might go a little higher, but, having read something of Fu Manchu, I recognize the story as being largely a reprise of some of those previous works. Not a bad story, but, the plot is definitely a retread. Not one of Sax Rohmer's better efforts in my opinion. There is just something missing from this tale that I can't nail down. And unfortunately, it is for that lack of that indefinable something, that I only rate this one as average.For free on Kindle, you can't quibble about the price."
5,Good Readable Story of Days Gone-by,"This is the first book by this author that I have read. I thoughly enjoyed this book and plan to purchase the rest of Rohmer's works in the ebook format. It is an exciting, well-written story with enough plot twists to keep me interested, and has just enough lurid touches to make it a very readable atmospheric mystery from the early twentieth century.Kudos to whomever transferred it to Kindle format!"
5,Great Bully poster!,"I ordered both the 11"" x 17"" and the 27"" x 40"" Frankenweenie posters and they came quickly, packaged really well, and in perfect order. Extremely happy with the service!"
1,SS Channel Set Eternity Ring,"Do not recommend this ring at all. Even though it is channel set, the stones keep falling out. The first stone had fallen out within an hour of the first time my mom wore it. She didn't do any housework or whack the ring on anything either."
1,Looked nice when new but later......,"This ring looked nice when new. The description states it's sterling silver. My wife wore it for about two weeks and the shiny finish started to peel. I assumed it was solid sterling, but it appears to be plated with sterling silver. A darker silver colored metal is under the peeled surface. I would not buy this item again."
5,"unique, great blend of instrumentals.","We at the Polanco resort in Austin,Tx appreciate the colorful blend of creative lyrics along side lavish instrumentals.We especially appriciate the guitar sound by the ""Piano Man""We hope to hear new music from him soonand maybe see him in concert at SXSW music festival!"
1,not what we expected,I don't know if i got a bad one but this toy is horrible. We are a little sad because we hoped for something fun and ended up with a dud.
1,Garbage,We couldn't get this thing to manage more than one stitch. I'm have years of experience with temperamental sewing machines and I couldn't get this one to work. I thifted it (new in the box) but it's still annoying to buy something only to throw it into the garbage.
5,The Greatest Sewing Machine Ever,I love this sewing machine. I got it for my birthday. It is great. Thank you barbie for creating it
1,HUGE waste of money,"My 6 year-old daughter received this as a Christmas gift and was very excited about using it. We quickly realized that it was too complicated for her. Even with an adult using it, the machine jammed up on the second use. My husband was able to get it unjammed and it immediately jammed up again. After several repetitions of this, I found myself wishing it had come with a receipt. I would most certainly not spend $40 on this machine."
2,-_-,"this was a fun toy at first. My daughter was very excited to use it and make fun crafts. but after the first couple of stiches everything got jumbled up and nothing worked. we finally got the thread untangled but after that it just didnt work. my daughter was very disapointed. and now the $50 that we payed for a barbie sewing machine is sitting in our closet, broken. It may be fun for younger children, as a pretend sewing machine, but if u really want to learn, dont get your hopes up with this toy!"
5,"Excellent, a Good and Eye Opening Read","Though the focus is on management, ""Managing"" is too limited a title for this excellent read. The book offers insights for those involved in cross cultural or multi cultural work or travel.Although written to academic standards for MBA and executive level courses with reference level detail, it reads like a popular non-fiction with anecdotes, stories and/or illustrative graphics illustrating every point.It seems pricey but the 300+ pages of its three sections make it really three books in one.As a cross cultural trainer I thought I knew this material, but professor Schneider helped move me to the next level. In addition to greater conceptual understanding I now have greater understanding of previously overlooked cross cultural nuance.Jonathan Kronerhttp://jonathankroner.com/"
4,Very good overview.,This book is a very good overview of the fire service and the steps necessary to make you a more desirable candidate. I highly recommend.
5,por la mazeta!!!,"cd is very interested for his 1rst solo he,s a pioneer in the island of pr and will continue the conquer of the world !!!!!THANKS JOHN!!! FROM BROTHER BENGY!!! IN PR LABRANZA!!!"
4,Great for Homeschool!,"Helped get my children ready for standardized testing. Easy to use. Does not have science or social studies, however."
3,Just didn't grab me,"The book is a little short on rigor sometimes, which is usually not a big deal for non-mathematicians. However, my main complaint is the author's writing style, somehow i could not sit down and read this book (a problem i usually don't have, even with books on things like functional analysis). I can't really put my finger on what it was, but he just didn't make the subject interesting for me. That being said, there's a lot of good stuff in here, and it has the added bonus of costing less than $15."
3,Not bad but still feels loose on me.,"It does the trick of keeping water out and it dries pretty darn fast, but the fit is something that could be improved. Maybe I have skinny legs or something, but, while the waistband is borderline tight, I still feel like I'm wearing a loose garbage bag over the rest of my lower body."
1,Very cheap quality,I would say these should not be more then $20. Very cheap quality and only a basic plastic shell. Extremely disappointed.
2,Like wearing a plastic bag,Not breathable and very uncomfortable to wear. You would be better off just wearing black garbage bags on your legs...
3,Content Brilliant but presentation is not the original cut.,"Rocky and Bullwinkle are great, but the original format has been changed for these DVD's. Instead of the chapter interludes (Fractured Fairy-tales, etc.), the story goes from beginning to end without ""interruption"". Anyone raised on Rocky and Bullwinkle will be a little disappointed that the style has been changed."
4,YEAH!,"This is such a great old classic. I have now introduced it to the newest generation, so hope to keep passing it on."
3,Not a book for people with technical skills,"This book would be good for people with little or no technical skills. Schaffer goes into good detail about how working in a high tech industry is different and more fast paced than other industries. He also goes into terminology one should know and understand when trying to get into the industry. However, the book is way too basic for people looking to get into the industry who have any sort of technical skills. I felt that this book did not provide any more information than any other book based on searching for jobs, regardless of the industry."
1,please be carefull while buying this stuff,"Hi All,I made an order for this Notebook ""Toshiba Satellite P25-S670 "".And this was from a third party seller.And i received a confirmation mail for my order from Amzon.And when i mail to the Seller, i did not get any reply from him.Also the customer service person from Amazon, is saying my order was not complete. (Even after Amazon had sent a confirmation mail to me about my order.)Seems like some thing is fishy....Please be carefull while bying any stuff from here.RegardsAshok"
3,Better as an article,"I agree this book would have been better as an article. It's a good quick read,but need more implementation ideas. You are your child's first teacher by Rahima Baldwin Dancy is better for parents starting out with Waldorf or seasoned parents for that matter!"
2,Not What I Hoped For.,"Since I am new to Waldorf ideas, I was hoping for a few more clearly-stated Waldorf principles and ways to apply them. This book wanders quite a lot. Although I agree with the main point of the book, that children need to play, some of the research the author presents and then the jumps to conclusion that follow are a bit far-fetched. I guess I'll move on to some other books."
2,Disappointing,"This book would have been better as an article.At times, she was all over the place.Some interesting points, but a lot of fluff."
3,"Flawed, but Necessary.","Great cast. Big budget for sets, costumes and makeup. Talented crew putting it all together. Some really great, hilarious ideas! But the show's fatal flaw? They DID EVERYTHING TO DEATH.Seems they threw EVERY joke they came up with into a sketch, and the thing just dragged and draaggged. onnnn. aaand oooooon. You enjoy the first half. You wait through the third quarter for the payoff. By the last quarter, you're just irritated.However, the fact remains . . . there is some brilliant, highly-rewarding comedy you just aren't gonna find anywhere else. Sometimes, when I'm tired, a fragment of a joke comes to me. ""Oh, what was that,"" I think to myself, ""Was that SNL? Was it Kids In The Hall? OH! No, it was The Ben Stiller Show!""And I feel a little glow of love for Ben, Janeane, Andy, and Bob, for they DO reward us for our patience. There ARE priceless laughs to be had, and I'll have them again and again!"
3,I hate to say it...,"Sometimes the memory is much better than the reality. I had fond memories of this show. While reviewing the DVDs recently, I realized that the one or two sketches I remember as being hilarious were indeed funny, but just. The other sketches were of rather poor quality. I wanted badly to like it, but it was rather embarassing; It was one of those shows that you brag to all your friends about how much they'll like it, only to shift uncomfortably as it unfolds before your eyes. One of those 'rent-before-you-buy's for sure."
4,Bashful's DVD Summary #008,"Best:1) The humor was free-flowing and one skit drifted quickly into another.2) Once you start watching an episode, you're hooked until it's over. All 12 (actually 13) episodes, plus bonus skits, are easy to watch back-to-back with plenty of good places to pause.3) Many of the skits were absolutely roll-around hilarious.4) The commentaries and behind-the-scenes features tell you everything you need to know about the series and why it was cancelled.Worst:1) The celebrity guests rarely participated in skits and sometimes had nothing entertaining to say or do.2) Some camera shots, especially the outdoor scenes, had a very low-budget look.3) Many of the joke references require you to have a knowledge of 1980's TV series to really understand.Recommendation:The price is good, the special features are generous and it's hours of entertainment with a high rewatch value. Get it - definitely."
2,OVERRATED,"I'll be frank. And not my neighbour Frank who lies alot, but candid. This show has it's funny moments, in particular the few sketches written by Cross or Odenkirk. The acting is good, but for the most part this show was disappointingly mediocre."
3,I wanted the MTV version,"I got screwed buying this, because these weren't the episodes I thought I was getting.I didn't realize it until I listened to some of the commentary, but I got the wrong version of the show I wanted. Before the 13 episodes of the Ben Stiller Show on Fox, there were 12 episodes on MTV - an entirely different set of shows. I remember howling in laughter at those episodes.When I ordered this DVD, I thought those were the only shows he ever did. The Fox show - which I never saw much and, all these years later, didn't realize were different from MTV - are not all that good.Is there anybody out there who has the MTV episodes?"
1,The worst!!! the positive reviews are plants for the distributor!,"Any of these reviews coming here have to be people who are working for the distributor of this garbage. There was a good reason this show was canceled after only 12 episodes. It stunk! Ben Stiller is an embarassment. Please save your money. Dont be taken in by the people who the distributor obviously planted, because there is no way an intelligent person could even mildly like this garbage."
3,"Funny, but it's complicated","The shows on this DVD are funny, as anyone who has ever watched the show can attest. My major annoyance is that the DVD is set up in such a way that you can't find your place--say, if I'd like to go to show #5, since I've watched the first four. Maybe I've just gotten too used to on-demand. Since the shows are not available on demand anywhere, I guess it's the price we pay."
5,One of the very BEST things that has ever entered my life.,"I LOVE BOB ODENKIRK. And everything he has done. He's a genius. He makes the show for me. Can't get enough of his skits. ""Maanson!!"" haha Also this is Ben Stiller and Andy Dick at their prime. Not the biggest fan of either but this show cuts the mustard for me! Way way way too good. I can watch this for months on end and it never grows old. Always a gut buster for me. I love dry humor. So this is right up my alley. I couldn't live my life without owning this series. Also David Cross was a writer near the end of the show. Who doesn't love David Cross? There are just too many good people involved in this show. They had fun with what they did and loved every minute of it and that's part of what makes this show so good. The commentary is swell as well! Another great thing that came out of the 90's!"
5,"HIlarious DVD, Ben Stillers origins","This is a great although short lived show. You can see a bunch of Bens future characters on this show, like the ""do it, do it"" guy from starsky and hutch. Great bits: The dead head insurance salesman, Tony Bobbins, the anti-drug speaker. Great show."
2,An Insult to SCTV and hair,"Being a baby buster, and not some tweenybopper who bought this 'thing' with the old guy from 'Duplex', I must admit that the 'Ben Stiller Show' is more of an interesting artifact (were we really that young?) than a genuine comedy classic. The filter of time made this a must-buy for me; sadly, I cannot recommend this dvd to casual or even hardcore sketch fans. The show has that same overreaching, too broad, too cool-for-school quality that made its sister Fox show 'In Living Color' such an unwatchable mess. The Odenkirk bits have some non-linear charm, but that's a plug for 'Mr Show'. For those who remember 'The Edge' or those horrific mid-90's SNL shows, it may be better to wait for those upcoming KITH and SCTV boxes."
4,Ben Stiller Show !,If you can even relate to the pig latin in the Three Stooges then you'll be amazed as Ben takes on such an impossible role as the Latin Lover. It's insane to watch him pull it off. Try a few words yourself let alone at the break neck speed that Ben pulls it off at!It's worth it just for those two sketches alone.
3,Uneven but Worthwhile Sketch Comedy,"Looking over the other reviews, I can see that most of them are unanimous when it comes to the best sketches on THE BEN STILLER SHOW: ""Cape Munster,"" the Manson/Lassie show, the DIE HARD and A FEW GOOD MEN parodies, the U2 and Springsteen take-offs, the ""Cops"" in Salem, Egypt, etc.Other parts of the show feel like filler, especially the Guest Stars who never participate in any of the sketches. The commentaries are interesting and the shows look good for the amount of money Fox put into them.(There's a preview of the obnoxious, annoying political loudmouth that is now Janine Garofalo when she goes off on a security guard being a ""pig, the Man, blah, blah, blah."")Good to have if you're fan of sketch comedy and what we'll have until SCTV is FINALLY released on DVD.And I'd love to see Andy Dick's wilder, edgier MTV show, ""The Andy Dick Show,"" make it to DVD."
2,Tisk Tisk,"Don't get me wrong, Ben Stiller is the man! With the new ""Starsky and Hutch"" movie out, you gotta think this is a good buy! I was very disappointed though. Andy Dick too! Usually hes funny...but I don't know what happened here! You wanna see Ben Stiller at his best? Go rent ""Meet the Parents"" or ""Starsky and Hutch"" or even ""Zoolander!"" Stay away from this one though. Good cast though...and good ideas! I think they just needed to develop them a bit more! BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!"
5,Hysterical!,"How I have waited for this DVD (and will continue to wait... 2010 release date? that can't be right...)! This is a very on-the-edge show which ran briefly in the early 90s, but developed a cult status. I hope they'll put the few episodes which aired on MTV on this disc, but I'm not holding my breath. The MTV version was my first exposure to Ben Stiller, and though he has done some standard fare movies, I love him for the truly hysterical guy he is. This cast is brilliant, the writing is perfect. You can't go wrong with this disc!"
5,Exfoliation genius!,"I have been using this product for 7 years. You see your skin peel visibly if there's any damage- dryness, damaged skin etc. If your skin is perfect, it keeps it that way. That's how I can tell if works in a balanced way. Sometimes, i peel. Other times I just maintain the integrity of my skin. Get this product."
5,Great stuff!,"This book comes second only to one on my shelf (and it would be unfair to mention the title here) It is thorough, informative and well researched. Everything the vampire fan - or budding hunter - could ever want to know about those fanged fiends."
3,Good Vampyre Fictional History,This book was not what I expected for it to be. However I was very pleased at its' context and that the book presented a sturdy history of the vampyre in both fiction and non-fiction. Worht having if you are intersted in vampyre history.
4,The second best basic reference book on Vampires,"I do not really have any major complaints about ""The Vampire Encyclopedia,"" I just think ""The Vampire Book"" is a better reference work on the undead. There are large areas of overlap, obviously, but if you have room on your shelf for more than one such book, by all means, this is a strong second choice. Actually, there is much more of a gap from this book to the rest of what's out there than there is from this to Melton's tome."
4,"Good, but limited","This book does provide an interesting and eclectic collection of vampire facts. However, Bunson's lack of documentation limits its usefullness. When one comes across a rare and interesting fact, it's impossible to trace where it came from.All in all, it's a good reference for the light enthusiast, but not great for actual resarch. Check out Melton's the Vampire Book for a well documented study."
2,A Not So Detailed Guide...,"I have read this book from cover to cover, and while it does give a brief explanation of quite a few things vampire related, it is far from complete. This is a bore to read through although it is a somewhat handy vampire reference guide. If you are looking for minimal detail This would be the guide for you.If you are looking for something more in depth, I would suggest the Vampire Book. It has many more entries and although it is quite thick, is very enjoyable to read. Not to mention it has more knowledge about vampires than you could ever ask for [in one place]."
5,Blood Quickie,"A good overall resource for vampire information, The Vampire Encyclopedia has some good tidbits that are hard to come by anywhere else. However, Bunson does not cite any specific sources for his facts, which make them hard to confirm and even harder to research more on the subject. The Vampire Encyclopedia is best used as a bedside reference rather than a source or starting point for research."
4,Good but to close to a cheap college porno flick,This movie was really goofy and laughable almost all the time. The only problem is that it is just a cheap porno type flick. The movie has no resemblence to the first film and even runs on a totally diffrent story line. The only original thing are three of the origanal ghoulies.
4,Ghoulies a la Animal House,"This is a terrible movie, and by terrible, I mean campy and enjoyable! I love that they talk now, but wish they kept all the original ghoulies, rather than subbing out for one that looks and sounds something like Alf. This is a very 80's style college / gremlins mash up."
1,The worst movie i have ever seen,"Ghoulies 3 really, really got off the subject of 1+2. It didn't have black magic anymore. The movie was more mischievious than the first two. In this movie they didn't come out of the toilet, which is what they are known for. I suggest to viewers not to rent this one"
1,Cheap wannabe slasher flick,"Ghoulies III is a cheap excuse for a Ghoulies film. Stupid NEW story line, NO gore, NO horror, and very little horror. The story, a cheap slapped-together piece of filth, about a comic that brings talking Ghoulies to life. And, just for kicks, there is some nudity thrown in. Don't waste your time with this ""horror-comedy""."
2,Lambert deserves better,"....Many people were interviewed for this book but very few of them were close to Lambert. Lambert is a private man and most of his friends respected his privacy by not giving interviews. While reading this book, one could not help but think that this book is not what Lambert would have wanted. Despite the amateur job, the author did provide some interesting stories and accounts about Lambert's younger days."
2,cute costume but difficult for children,"I purchased this costume for my grandson. The costume was very cute. There were problems though. The costume has very large hands that are enclosed. We had to remove the big monkey hands to allow my grandson to be able to hold anything including his candy bag. The feet we also very big making it difficult for my grandson to walk. The head piece was large enough for an adult, much to large for a toddler. Although the costume is very cute, I would not recommend purchasing."
1,Not very high quality for the price.,"This costume is not as cute as it is in the picture. When I recieved it I will have to admit I was disapointed. It was falling apart at alot of the seams,the feet just looked like pajamas not like the monkey feet in the pictured and the tail was about to fall off. If you are looking for a warm quality costume as I was I wouldnt recommend this costume as your choice=("
4,Very useful reference,Excellent reference for all linguists/students. Sort of difficult to study with however...Should be divided into categories if you intend to use it as a study manual.
4,Nice compilation of short stories,This book contains a series of short historical fiction stories in chronological order that illustrate the western movement of settlers across the continent. It is a great book for youth and adults alike.
2,Not bright very small,these lights are not bright at all. they are useless cause they only emit an extremely low blue glow. Not a good buy.
3,Good But Falls Short of Revolutionary Road,"A Distant Second to Revolutionary Road.Yates draws some compelling characters in this drama about a mother's inability to come to terms with a cruel world that doesn't give a damn about her 3rd rate artwork, and her son, a young private in the army during WWII. There were some poignant moments and Yates, as always, shows us the dirty underside of the american dream, but he strays too far from these strengths in A Special Providence.Half the novel takes place in a war setting, and frankly, Yates' war-writing is some of the least memorable I've ever read. Try Mailer or Herr or Heller if that's what you're looking for. Another annoying tidbit is the repetitiveness of the narrative.Anyway, it's a pretty good read, but nothing ""great"". Yates is better when he stays closer to home. This story is not as tightly wound as Rev Road, and we don't care about the characters nearly as much. Okay, that's my two cents."
5,Great Read,"Richard Yate's novel about a mother and son torn by very different dreams is poignant, pragmatic and heart wrenching. A great read for anyone who appreciates Yate's work."
4,A captivating story,"War, personal relationships, family ties all knit together beautifully by Richard Yates. You get emotionally attached to the story and maybe identify with it if you are a parent. The storyline and the flashbacks are nicely presented and the language is well written and flows smoothly."
3,"Recommended, but not yates' best","This book had me hanging on every well-written word till about halfway through the WW2 parts of the story. The descriptions were good, and the depictions of war realistic, and the characters (main character""s fellow army guys) believable and fairly interesting in their personal quirky ways, but somehow it got repetitive and tedious. So I sped-read through sections of the war story. More interesting were the stories from the mother character's point of view, the retelling of her life with her son.Still a very good book. Mother character is like other mother characters in his other books. I've read a few of Yates' novels and there are still more. Want to read them too. His most well-known is Revolutionary Road. No doubt about it, he is a great American author."
1,You have got to be kidding?,"I endeavor to follow the addage that if you have nothing nice to say then say nothing; however, this work is redundant, virtually devoid of any actionable insights, and smacks of a self indulgent attempt to justify his own ideosycratic work habits. I kept going in hopes that one concept would justify my investment of mind. The only return on my investment is a book I can now confindently refer to those I distain and assiduously warn those I adore to avoid.I am fairly sure the majority of previous reviews are from nodes in his social network who have seized upon his scintilating suggestion that effective knowledge workers maintain and nuture their relationships by treating them well. It is sycophantic myopia when work which could and should be great barely achieves mediocracy receives any praise whatsoever.If Mr. Davenport reads these words please know that I harbor no ill will to you personally I just found this particular publication of your work seriously wanting."
1,"Shallow, not actionable","If you manage in a high-intensity service industry and are looking for tips on how to evoke higher performance from your knowledge workers, keep searching for another book. Take 5 minutes and read the summary at the end of the chapters; you'll quickly see that there is little practical information or depth here."
5,An outstanding recording,"Poco remains one of the best groups of the sixties and this is one of their best recordings. Great guitar work, and excellent music throughout. If you like Poco, give a listen to the Flying Burrito Brothers."
5,One of the best gifts to give new parents,"I was given an older copy of this book when my son was born 9 years ago. This quickly became my favorite book. It told me what to expect from my child, initially from month to month, and as he got older, from year to year. When he developed a cough at midnight, I was able to figure out what the problem might be and what to do about it. If a rash shows up, they're all described in here. Now, I give this as a shower gift to any of our expecting friends. Great product."
5,gift for my SIL,I bought an earlier version of this book when I was pregnant with my eight year-old and liked it so much I ordered one for my SIL.
1,Dr Spock Retracted all his child rearing nonsense,"I hope you people all realize that this guy, Dr. Spock retracted pretty much every notion he put to paper about child rearing.He's influence generations of child rearing to the detriment of our society to the point of no return and yet no one pays attention to how he took it all back."
4,Old time baby info,This book is exactly what I was looking for. I used the original Dr. Spock book when raising my children and now will use this newer version for my grandchildren..
4,Great for first-time parents,"Though you must take some of his child-rearing advice with a grain of salt, this is the most comprehensive childcare book I've encountered. It is very reader-friendly in that it is well-organized and ""easy"" to read. I've seen some books that are way too generalized, simply giving you information that is already intuitive for most people. This book touches on everything with just enough depth. I think it is especially handy to have the first-aid information at reach. While there are always more detailed resources like WebMD, the dangers in using such sources are that unlicensed, untrained parents end up feeling a mistaken sense of security in being able to ""diagnose"" their own children. This book allows parents quick access to answers for basic questions--and besides, who is going to spend the time surfing the internet in an emergency when you can quickly grab a book instead?"
2,Very specific and low practice,"The contents are very interesting , however are usefull only if one has a strong quantitative skill.On the other hand, the book has only a small quantity of examples and I am not sure if it can really be applied in the ""real world"""
3,"Thermos is great, Web info is wrong.",The thermos really does keep my coffee hot throughout the day! I have no complaints with the quality of the item itself. The Amazon Web site says this is a 23 oz bottle. It is not! It is a 16 oz bottle. If you are looking for a small bottle that will keep liquids hot all day this is it.
5,Eye Opener!,Want to know where we are headed? There are things presented on this dvd that Drunvalo talks about that will open your eyes to the future of the human race. The title fits it perfectly. Its like watching a young child discovering something for the first time they are just in awww! You will be too!
4,Makes it real easy,Follow the easy plans in this book and you'll find yourself with a cute birdhouse.If you want to make things even easier you can buy a kit from houses4birds.com
4,This is a well made lamp,This is a quality product. I have used it on my sailboat for a couple of years without any issues. The entire lamp does get extremely hot -- it will burn you if you touch any part of the lamp after it has run for more than a few minutes.
5,Years of Debate.,For years I could not decide what my favorite movie was.... Untill today. My number one. period.
5,Woodstock 40th Anniversary Edition :Best Boxed Set for the Value EVER!,"This was a very smart buy on my part. I definitely recommend this product to any avid Woodstock lover! Or even a lover for the greatest music in the history of Rock n' Roll. There was a perfect description of what I was purchasing, and I got exactly what I was expecting to pay for. GREAT BUY!"
5,Wonderful event..,Fantastic DVD.. This really does capture the moment.. The current generation could do with giving this one a view!!I wonder if anyone could tell me the name of the song that plays on this directors cut 9 mins 45 secs in.. The song plays over the imagery of the stage being set up..The lyrics start with... If you smile at me.. il understand!!Thanks in advance
2,with so many stars playing it sure rates low in the star rating system,"I will add more to this later as I force myself to watch itA shame they use a double sided disk for all the music and not use 2 disks, put both in the player and enjoy, no I am not lazy.how in the world can a mistake be made on what song is being played as listed on the box and in the online description?Canned Heatnow that sure is not ""going up the country"" !!the name of that song is ""A change is going to come""Quality is not too good, I have a friend who was there and I think his description (even today) is of better quality. What a shame to not do a better job, with technology today a little care could have gone a long way!!geez what a shame!!"
2,Director's Cut - Woodstock,"This DVD(s) was a disappointment in terms of selection. Only one song by Janis. No real songs by Crosby-Stills-Nash that were seen, only heard. A lot of the background stories are interesting. I agree that it does take you back to a time that will never return, which is sad."
3,What happend to the bonus disc?,I bought this item from Amazon especially for the special bonus disc. Much to my surprise there isn't a bonus disc included. Don't buy this set for the special bonus disc.
2,"Expected better quality audio/video, got a lot of silly memerobilia instead","The blueray audio/video is not noticibly better than DVD. I seem to have paid extra for a lot of very silly memorabilia, such as a reproduction of the show ticket and a case that looks like one of those suede leather jackets that were popular in the late 60's early 70's My guess is that they put their investment in this silly memorabilia rather than a digital remastering of the movie that would have taken advantage of the blueray format. This is not a good value. Look for this movie in a simple, less expensive product packaging."
5,Where are they now?,"Buy this for Michael Shrieve's drum solo on Santana's ""Soul Sacrifice"", and for Ten Years After's ""I'm Going Home (by helicopter)"", with Alvin Lee on lead guitar and the crowd on percussion."
1,"`Say one thing, sell another","Ordered this item expecting the description to actually match what I received in the mail. Silly me!Item description states that the package includes bonus extras like a Life magazine excerpt reprint, fancy 'fringed' packaging, patch, etc.Nope- what showed up was a simple plastic DVD sleeve with discs rattling around inside. Since it's a gift I haven't opened to to see how bad the damage is, or what the quality of the actual video and sound is, but let's just say I don't have very high hopes. Buyer beware, if you're thinking of ordering this, all you're going to get is a couple discs... and disappointed. 'MovieMars' was the vendor."
2,eh,"i expected more from this dvd. was not an enjoyable watch, but i may give it another chance someday"
2,DISHONEST,"There are many good things to say about this rockumentary: we were all surprised by the high quality production; the finest performances were showcased with startling clarity; and the editing was incredible. But wow! What was hyped as an honest recollection of the events up to and including the concert turned out to be the very commercialized effort it was thought to protest against. Nothing was said of the capitalistic negotiations that made the festival possible. The few scenes of litter made it look as though it was a ""KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL"" rally, when in fact it was not. The politicking by the bands was ignored, and the salesmen must've vanished for awhile. Rather sad for those of us who thought this was as much a political convention as a show. It was a muddy good show though...thats about it. Nothing good came of it. A wretched poor document."
3,3 stars is probably kind,"I found the audio/video quality to be pretty good. Kudos to the engineers. However, there was si much more to Woodstock that I had hoped to find on this dvd that I cannot offer high marks for content. Too many important performances were omitted. CS&N was abbreviated, Santana was shorted.....you get the pic. Too much relatively worhtless documentary style footage and woefully short on concert footage. There has to be an alternative. Can't some studio put up the cash to get better/more complete footage of this historic musical event. The cameras were there - where's the footage?"
3,Not Blu-ray Quality,"I just received my new super deluxe Blu-ray 40th Anniversary edition of this film. The packaging is really nice. But as for the video quality, I wish I had read more of the reviews here before I put down my money for this set. It is definitely not high definition. None of is is better than DVD video quality, and much of it looks no better than VHS. If I had it to do over again, I'd get the DVD for the same video quality at a cheaper price. Another thing to note: the Amazon web page I was just at, says the aspect ratio is 1.77:1. Not true. This is more like 2.35. There are black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. That in itself is no big deal, as many pictures are shown in 2.35 aspect ration. But it is misleading to say otherwise. Anyway, save your money and go with the DVD set, or just stick with your old VHS."
3,Woodstock 2008 Director's Cut,I bought the 2009 anniversary cut of the movie after visiting Woodstock for the first time. I would like to compare it to the original film. A pretty good movie of a seminal Sixties' event.
1,WOODSUCK !,"I was thinking of buying this item, but after reading the reviews, and finding out just what is NOT included in it, I said SKIP it!! All the other bands that did not make it to the previous versions are NOT on here. I guess in order to see them you have to have a BLU-RAY player, which I don`t have, and in these tight times, do not plan to get.(In my opinion BLU-RAY is a waste of money, once you get used to it, you would`nt want to go back to standard, so your hooked on it and its higher prices). This is a NOT SO SPECIAL EDITION. How many years will it take before the regular people can have the full version. Maybe I`ll get the 50th anniversary version! PASSSSS! ""Hey You, Get Off Those Towers"""
1,rip off just DVDS,This guy sends you just the rwo DVDS NOTHING ELSE!!! NOTHING that was advertised. All the little extras you don't get.`
2,Leave it alone,I watch Woodstock on my old VHS tape I recorded years ago. It is not the best quality but I love it. There is a beauty about how Woodstock was; a feel that cannot be recreated. It is sad to think people buying the dvds will be hearing 'fixed' Woodstock music. It will take away from the feeling of the way it was. Please leave it alone. It stands on its own as a masterpiece. Some things should not be changed.
1,Not what was expected.,"I was expecting a musical DVD, not a history of Woodstock.This was advertised as featuring Creedence Clearwater Revival,They were not on this film."
1,Didn't like it very much,"It's ""R"" rated, and I'm no prude, but the ""F"" word was said about 15 times past the point of being an effective expletive.Otherwise, I think the editing was rather poor and it didn't keep my attention."
4,They Cut Jefferson Airplane Short,"I've had this DVD for quite a while now and I love it the onlyproblem I have right now with it is during Jefferson Airplane's""Uncle Sam Blues"" they Skip A whole guitar Solo I also have the woodstock boxset and it has the complete solo, why they would cut it out i don't know, and also we don't need two joan baez songs instead put in another Santana song, other than that I have no Complain, I also think that Canned Heat's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" is one of the best performances on here even better than some of Hendrix's Songs."
1,"At heart,It's not really about the music","Well,this film is something of a 'curate's egg'.... As a reminder of the hippy scene of the late 60's it delivers. [Although looking back now, the 'scene' seems hilariously self-absorbed and frankly cringe inducing in places].As a social documentary,I'd give it 4 stars at leastBut as a concert film it is dull, too 'chopped up' and not really worth buying for repeat viewing. For example,the butchered set of Hendrix was played over footage of all the rubbish being cleared up....hmmSo if you're primarily a music lover,in particular if you like full un-interrupted song footage,I suggest you rent this and buy something else insteadAll together now- 'no rain,no rain,no rain....'!"
2,woodstock 40th anniversary ultimate collection blu-ray,"I was disappointed with this product. Blu-ray did not enhance the video quality as much as I had hoped, and the aspect ratio left huge black borders not only at the top and bottom, which I can accept; but also on the sides, which I cannot. Sound quality was also disappointing. In my view, this was a waste of money."
5,HIPPY,"I BOUGHT ""WOODSTOCK: 3 DAYS OF PEACE & MUSIC..."" FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVED IT. TOOK HIM BACK TO A SIMPLER TIME!!! A NICE KEEPSAKE."
3,Looking fo Ten Years After,"Can anyone tell me where I can get the extra footage of Ten Years After and Alvin Lee at Woodstock?I understand they played a whole set of their music there, but only I'm Going Home is in the movie.I would love to see/hear the other stuff.Thanks."
5,"FAR OUT, MAN","Go to see ""Taking Woodstock"" and then buy this collection. You'll want to put on your desert boots and bell bottoms again. If you went to Woodstock or remember it, even in a brown, heavy haze, you'll want this collection."
2,BUY THE VHS - not the DVD,Read the other reviews.I bought the VHS to see if it was better than the DVD. It is! Better video AND sound quality. Warner Home Video did a poor job on the DVD version. It is NOT truly widescreen (as you will see if you buy the VHS). It is more pan-and-scan full screen. You WILL get a better movie by buying the VHS and copying it to DVD.
4,"Good set, but get the complete set from Amazon UK instead","I bought this blu ray set last year before realizing that there were exclusive performances and featurettes on different versions from Amazon and Target. The packaging is clever, but I would have preferred a standard blu ray case.I ended up selling it and getting the blu ray from amazon.co.uk. It comes in a standard blu ray case and features all 6 of the extra performances and 7 extra featurettes from Amazon and Target. The blu ray is region free and plays fine in us blu ray players. It is currently around $20. Definitely the way to go to get everything.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Woodstock-Blu-ray-Jimi-Hendrix/dp/B001V7P2MM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1274286271&sr;=8-1"
2,Bad translation from VHS,"1. Bad Menu Options2. Bad Sound, besides the 5.1 the sound its soo bad3. The Screen resolution and editions its catastrophic.4. The only thing to remark its the case (photos, book, and the ticker memorabilia)In general a very bad product."
1,Woodstock,"This version is not near as good as the version I seen years ago.It has several windows showing different scenes at one time, very hardto follow."
2,Wrong item pictured,"This is not the Woodstock ""Target Only"" exclusive. The Target exclusive comes in a canister resembling a popcorn tin with a tambourine on top. It also includes an entirely different bonus disc than the Amazon exclusive. I have since had to request refund. Please keep that in mind when ordering."
2,Not a favorite,This was a disappointment. I had expected much better sound quality from a Bluray disk. Most DVDs are much better sound quality than this blurry.
3,movie,This was a blu-ray movie and I didn't see that when I ordered it. I don't think the blu-ray movies are marked well. We don't have a blu-ray player so gave them away.
4,"Great release, but .... ???","For starters, this bluray release is only 2 discs, not 3 as advertised. Secondly, what exactly are the Amazon 'exclusive' extras ??? You'd think this type of information was, one, correct and secondly specific in what buyers want to know. Whoever wrote up the product information failed on two counts here."
2,Review Hits the BullsEye,"Reviewer Thomas Thatcher is absolutely correct in every aspect of his review. Younger people ask me about that time (I had the long hair, blue jeans, and Dingo boots, etc.)and I set them straight about things as I see them. Referencing the film, one student found ""the dialogue and antics of the hippies...."" to be corny. This documentary on ""Woodstock"" is a fascinating cultural artifact but that's about it."
4,"An interesting view of times of the past, how a big concert can be peacful.","Although it was before my time, as a big music fan I took the opportunity to pick this film up when I saw it on sale. I can see why they tried to re-create the feeling of these times by staging woodstock 94 and 99, unfortunate that 99 ruined a great thing. If you like music from that era, this film is a definite must have. The who, Hendrix, Joe Cocker to name a few, but many other as well. Interesting look into Flower power. I don't nessesarily agree with everything in the movie, but this is an important American Documentary. Something for any Music person to watch at least once in their life."
4,Nice but....,This is a very nice edition of the woodstock film. I'm not at all sure that the Blu-ray version is any better than the normal DVD. I have both and just don't see that it is worth the extra cost.
2,OVERDUBS?? For WOODSTOCK??!!!,"Why in the WORLD would you ""ADD"" overdubs and RE-RECORD MUSICAL PERFORMANCES FOR THIS??!! The HISTORY is in the ORIGINAL performances and music - not somebody covering up a miffed riff or covering a bum note or track 40 YEARS LATER!! I know the ""soundtrack"" had alot of things in it that it shouldn't have and that it's ""common practice"" to ""sweeten-up"" and change things on ""Live"" albums - but jJust because we CAN do something doesn't mean we SHOULD do it! The whole point of Woodstock was one of Peace and Love and TRUTH and HONESTY - this seems kinda; counter to those ideals. Everything else about this project seems SOOOO great - the ""bonus"" material, extended performance footage, behind the scenes, ect. - why have people dubbing in parts 40 years after the fact?"
3,Wish the music were as good as the documentary,"I'm a child of the Sixties. Was overseas in the Army in 1969. Love that era's music. (Beatles, Stones, Animals, Doors, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Simon & Garfunkel, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, The Temptations, Four Tops, Wilson Pickett, Creedence Clearwater, Santana, and so many others.)My only problem with the film is the music. Some was great (Joe Cocker, Santana, Sly, CS&N;), some awful (Joplin, Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane), but too much just mediocre. Why did Joan Baez, John Sebastion, and Arlo Guthrie leave their best songs at home? How did Sha Na Na even get invited, much less make the editor's cut? What of the other musicians we hear about who performed at Woodstock?I'm selling my copy and hoping to live long enough for another version to come out. One retaining all the wonderful documentary footage but bringing us a better selection of music.The 50th Anniversary Edition? I can only hope I live so long."
4,A piece of history,"I grew up during the Woodstock era and love the music from this period. Several of my favorite groups performed at Woodstock so I wanted to own the video. It is a good historical piece. The blu-ray is great. I was a bit disappointed that not all of the performances were included. But if you want to remember Woodstock and not spend a lot of money on the special sets and editions, this is the DVD to get."
3,"Great Event, Great Music, Poor Quality","Being of the Woodstock generation I remember vividly going to the theater and watching this revolutionary movie. I say revolutionary because it was ahead of its time for cinema effects. The use of the split screen was a precursor to MTV. It has an awesome soundtrack. It captured the young people that were into rock music during that era better than any film that has survived the 70's in my view.I realize this movie was made in the 70's, but the theater version was much better quality than this release. The quality is just plain bad. It is certainly not DVD quality (or VHS quality for that matter) and that was a big disappointment. It is grainy and even fuzzy in places. If I did not respect Amazon so much I would say it was a bootleg copy made with a video camera taken into a theater.The music is outstanding, however, and it is a historical look into the lifestyle of the hippy generation. For that, I gave it three stars."
2,"Rating is for this version ,not the Concert","I have a borrowed copy so I am not bitter about buying this CHEAP rehash. Director's cut... means what? We all know that Woodstock was a groovy phenomenon - there's no debate there, and the positive reviews for this product are giving credit where its due. However, if I was a consumer I would be enraged. As another viewer mentioned, the sub titles are in places hysterically inaccurate- Couldn't the producers of this version hire a fact checker? Additionally- there are no extras at all, and the two sided disc is not mentioned anywhere. The dvd just cuts off and turns to black while CSN are still talking. I thought something happened to my TV. ( yeah man, the cats that put together this version were just not being cool - and that's not me just rappin' with a negative vibe- ya dig? Don't waste your bread man.) See the movie, just don't buy this version."
3,What's not there?,"Heck- i really expected more from this DVD than I got.I would have preferred if they'd included film versions of all the stuff released on the larger box set which preceded this release by a year or two I think.No Creedence Clearwater, no Airplane's Eskimo Blue Day (easily a high point on the original 3 album release)- & you can barely tell Nicky Hopkins is on stage with them, if it hadn't been announced, though he gets some great licks in on Uncle Sam Blues.And who is the moron responsible for the lousy subtitles?It reminds me of the jokey subtitles used on Japanese releases of 60's albums- some of them are real clinkers.And while the DVD mentions there are special features I sure couldn't find them. Perhaps I need to go over it with a fine toothed comb again, but you have too few choices, and the whole product seems to have been rushed. A letdown for only forty more minutes of music."
3,Dance to the Music,"Where was it on the video? Dance to the Music by Sly & the Family Stone was one of the greatest moments at Woodstock. It's on the album (yes,I'm old enough to have owned albums), but unfortunately missing here. Another great moment missed by the filmakers was the Airplane doing Volunteers. The film starts out with the intro. and then completely skips over the song (it's on the cd for anyone who wants to hear it and it rocks!). At the end of the day, the film depicts many great moments, but missed too many festival highlights that were on the original album and are now on the CD. The filmakers should have added those cuts. The CD is a better buy for your money and listening pleasure."
4,Woodstock 3 days of peace & music 40th Anniv.,Outstanding if you don't know much about the event this will enlighten you. Outstanding talent music wise and to the people who organized the event.
3,The '60's - not what they used to be?,"The packaging on this 40th Anniversary edition of the Woodstock movie was superb, but the show itself just doesn't hold up like it once did. I AM older, I AM sober, but I'm still idealistic. The sets seem overly long and slow and drawn out. I love the artists, but they do not hold the same joy for me as they once did - some haven't been heard from for years, so it is like long-lost friends showing up at the door: what DO you talk about? I probably won't watch this too many more times. I was once SO excited about the concert, the artists, the era...pity."
4,As near to the 60's you can get,"For a person not born in the sixties this provides a glimpse of the social unease experinced by many young people around the late 60's. This unease is found among the the anti-vietnam & anti-govrnmant slant among the songs. Besides the political and social upheavel going on at that time the spirit of all musicians was very much ""We are all here to make good music and have a good time"". Everybody including this viewer had a good time watching this DVD."
2,where's Johnny?,"The theatrical release had a GREAT Johnny Winter performance of 'Big Town Blues', one of my favorites. I bought this after reading about all the 'extra' footage..stupid me, I never imagined that would mean =deleting= the -best- footage...Johnny's gone!"
4,"Muy bueno , pero falta mas musica!!","Me gusto mucho esta edicion de DVD , pero me pareceque se quedaron un poco cortos en los referente a la musica, pues tengo el Woodstock Diary que salio en Europa , y tiene tal cantidad de canciones que no aparecen en esta edicion que me parece increible, como el caso de Qill ,The Band y Joe Cocker el cual solo aparece una cancion nunca antes vista.En todo caso esperemos salgan los grupos que sabemos que tocaron pero que no aparecen ni en la fotograciasRicardo Rivera Rodriguez"
3,"Great movie, but missing the 2 extra performance hours","Great rendition of the original movie, and the Blu-Ray quality really makes the split screen sequences shine.My only complaint is my second disk did not contain any of the promised extra 2 hours of musical performances. The ""Untold Stories"" section only had short Woodstock opening and Woodstock closing videos, and had none of the promised extra performances.Are the extra performances only available on BD Live?I have a Sony BDP-S350 with the extra memory loaded and firmware update 7.2.019 installed."
2,"I Agree it's a waste of money,","Honest to God being of the Woodstock generation I had Great expectactions from this releaase, and was very dissapointed with the resolution and the editing of this version. I was really loking for something that looked like the original theatrical release and this fell very short. Plus the contrast in part was just poor, and no it's not my set, I have never had this isssue before, except on vintage not HD films. I could not see anything about this being HD Nothing."
3,could have been better,"buying this on blu ray was expecting something wonderful,but what i got was a gloried dvd.having bought the deluxe dvd box set,which i must say is great,was expecting probly too much,but with all the hoopla on blu ray one must think is it worth it getting it on a new format and though the product is well over 40 years old would expect some wonders.sad to say this is not the case with blu ray.i want my soxes to be blown off and circling the earth.this is not the caseif you want woodstock get the dvd.the only good thing about blu ray is saving yourself from getting up and changing the discs.so now my favourite piece if history, i have it on all formats.peace and lovefarout man"
1,Couldn view since wrong country zone,Since I live in Sweden and the video was aimed for US audience I couldnt watch it on my dvd. I did not see anywhere when buying where I could choose zone. I need to buy new one.Camilla wirseen
3,Wasn't what I thought it was,"First let me say that I was the idiot who thought that this contained the whole Woodstock concert (all days and all footage). Instead, I got one or two videos from each artist. I wanted to see all of Jimi Hendrix's concert or all of Janis Joplin's. Sadly, its not here. A friend said I'd have to find and purchase a different dvd and that costs alot more. I give it three stars because I did enjoy the videos that were there and they made me feel as if I was at the concert. If you are looking for the entire concert with videos of all songs from each artist, this is not it."
2,Nothing Special - SPLIT SCREAM,"I am not a fan of split screen and that is what this is. A split screen in HD is no better than a split screen in regular 480, with small images like this there is no real improvement. I was never a fan of hippies either, but the music was why I bought this. It is 1969 and this is nothing as good as the Mets winning the world series. I can not get past the split screen, I made a bad error in judgement to buy it. I will watch it once and forget about it. I bought it because it was 26 bucks on special of the day...big deal, it's still bad filming and even worse post production. Wow I can see the grainy cheap print in Blu-Ray! Sound is 1969 Muntz 8 Track. It sound awful on my really good home theatre surround. Very disappointed, but it is about what I expected. I blame myself for being so stupid. I knew better! Makes me want to go back to VHS."
4,Time capsule that is still mesmerizing,"Who hasn't seen this yet? The older it gets, the more contemporary it seems. Just a different war now than 40 years ago. The clothing and hair styles are pretty much back in 2009, same as 1969. The film is edited such that actual events and musical performances are not in line with how it really happened. For example, Sha Na Na went on right before Hendrix on Monday morning, but this is edited to look like they were on mid-show. The performances that have held up best: Joe Cocker, Santana, Hendrix, CS&N. Even at more than three hours, this still omits probably 40-50 hours of musical performances, not to mention all the other film that was shot. I loved the apocalyptic ending showing the garbage, smoke from fires and the mud left over. And the scroll of all the dead from that era is sobering."
5,Priceless,"I'm writing this review just to be contrary. What makes the movie worthwhile is that the music is mixed with ""mundane"" footage - the performances weren't generally outstanding at Woodstock, while the sheer magnitude of the event, and the problems it caused (food shortages, sanitary problems, disturbance of the Woodstock locality), are special and worth including for the permanent record. If you miss more songs from your favorite performers, consider how long this film would be if every artist received generous treatment from the film makers. For my taste, anyway, there's more than enough music and lots of stuff that most people who attended the event never had a chance to see. Woodstock is well worth the 3 or 4 hours it takes to see it all, and I'm glad it isn't 6 or 8 hours long."
2,They cut the good stuff,"I purchased this DVD with high expectations, and was very disappointed. The directors cut seems to have lost lots of the good stuff from the original, like Arlo Guthrie's live performance of Coming Into Los Angeles has been replaced with the studio version (which sucks). It coulda been a contenda..."
5,Woodstock,"A ""happening"" frozen in time. Music and musicians the like of which will never pass this way again. It was never to beduplicated though they are still trying. A must see for anyone who lived through it and anyone who missed it.Love, Peace and Happiness !"
5,Woodstock Rocks On!,"This two-disc set will make you feel like you're there (or for some, there AGAIN!) It contains fabulous music and well-videod performances by some of the BEST of the 60's bands!! If you loved the era, or want to get a taste of it for the first time, this is the video for you!"
4,Get it if you don't have the Directors cut DVD,"While I like the multichannnel remix overall I'd say if you already have the Directors cut DVD then I wouldn't spend the money on the Blu-Ray. The picture on the DVD looks the same on the Blu-Ray which makes sense since I would guess that the original footage was shot in 16mm. The audio on the other hand sounds much better than on the DVD. If you're an audio purist than you probably won't like the multichannel mix, but I'm not a purist so I enjoyed it. If you haven't seen the Director's cut then definiately buy the Blu-Ray. The extra footage is worth the price."
4,nice DVDs,I remermber the original movie. This is so much more... I have trouble understanding how they decided what to keep..
1,DVD has REGION CODES,This DVD didn't play on my player. These DVDs apparently have Region Codes embedded in them (didn't know that) and this was made in a country other than the United States. Got a refund.
5,Couldn't have done better,I ordered this item as a gift and was naturally concerned about it arriving in time for the event. I was amazed to find it in my mailbox within days and in the precise condition promised. I love Amazon.oom and it's many affiliated sellers. I order quite often and have yet to be disappointed in any aspect of the process or products.
3,OVERDUBS?? For WOODSTOCK??!!!,"""Re-recording"" parts 40 YEARS LATER?!! ""Fixing"" parts?!! WHY?? LEAVE IT ALONE!! Don't try to ""fix"" a part of history for me! I don't want to hear someone WHO WASN'T EVEN THERE play THEIR ""interpretation"" of what someone else played LIVE at the greatest music festival ever - I want hear what was- or WASN'T -played that weekend - not someone in a studio 40 YEARS LATER!! How shall we ""rewrite"" history next?! ""Help out"" Picasso? ""Fix-up"" Dali? Change a few words in a Martin Luther King speech to make it ""better""??!! ""Restoration"" is ONE thing - CHANGING it is another........"
2,Woodstock Director's Cut (40th Anniversary) 2009,"Just received today and wish I read the other comments before ordering.I had the 1994 VHS cd, before it got lost and the video quality was better that this one."
3,Wish They would release the original cut too.,The restoration of this film is great but the directer's cut back in 1994 added 40 minutes and I think the film is bloated and too long. The additional footage to the closing Jimi Hendrix section is particularly too long and needs editing. I just wish Warners would release the original theatrical cut that played in 1970. That film had better pacing.
4,A good one DVD effort of this Historic event.,"This is a good representation on the Historic rock n roll event on one DVD. It looks and sounds great. I would give it a five star but its a two sided DVD, and I hate having to turn em over. It's a must have for anyone who wants to revisit this historic event."
3,Woodstock Blue Ray search,"I was just in high shool at the time and first saw Woodstock at the drive in. Bought and loved the VHS and the orginal soundtrack. The problem is DVD. I bought the directors cut and found the sound quality superb but it was nevertheless not the orginal. I keep looking for the orginal in Blu Ray but can only find the directors cut. Id the VHS version is out there on Blu Ray, I'd buy it in a heart beat. many thanks for any help in my quest."
4,wanted more music but what's there is great,"i agree with the person who wished he could have heard more.i especially would have enjoyed hearing ""santana's"" whole set. that being said, it's still sounds stunning on dvd. ""soul sacrifice'by ""santana"" with the subwoofer vibrating throughout the room made me feel like i was there. also,"" ten years after"", ""joe cocker"", and ""jimi hendrix"" sound superb. i wish they could have used a better song by ""janis joplin"". as well as a better song by jefferson airplane""."
1,All Four DVDs Badly Scuffed,"After carefully removing the DVDs from the cardboard sleeves to ***avoid scratching***, I found all four DVDs badly scuffed from being jammed into the cardboard sleeves. These sleeves are a disaster waiting to happen. If they must be cardboard, why not digi-paks with a spindle to offer some protection to the playing surface? A replacement is enroute from Amazon but I am not holding my breath. If (when?) these DVDs arrive scuffed, I'll be asking for a refund!Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition with Amazon Exclusive Bonus Disc)"
2,disappointed:(,"i was very disappointed ... i know there are better episodes of this show then what is provided in the dvd set ""the best"". i may not be of age to know what the original air date may have been like to thoughs who have seen it but i can appricate the comedy timing of rowan and martin. and i tell you this is not the ""best"". Rhino can do better!!!!"
2,BEST OF rowan and martins laugh in,"Best of, ha. this is not a best of dvd. It is just six SCATTERED episodes of laugh in. BEST OF means best clips of all the shows.I dont even thing these were the best 6 shows they created. I am strongly thinking of returning my copy."
2,"Bad package, bad show","Why is it that in an age when you can get a whole season of a television show on DVD for less than 30 dollars, you need to pay 45 dollars for six episodes of a show that quite frankly wasn't all that great to begin with? I bought this collection for my father (a former hippie) for his birthday despite the fact that it was a huge rip-off. He seems more-or-less pleased with the episodes included, but doesn't think it's worth what I payed (he saw the receipt).I managed to get the Best of Monty Python's Flying Circus (a much funnier sketch comedy program from about the the same time period) for only twenty dollars. That collection is loaded with special feature and has at least twelve episodes. I highly reccomend that collection over this any day."
5,Very Satisfied Customer,"I bought this DVD as a present, I was very happy when I received it that it looked brand new. The person that I gave it to was also very happy and has spent many, many hours watching his new shows."
3,What we have here is NOT MUCH,"In the late 1960's, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In was an entertainment of sight gags, skits and one liners. It was Vaudville, Burlesque and low brow humor combined in an hour of TVThis DVD of six episodes fully takes in what the show had to offer. You could call this DVD A taste of Laugh-In. It captures in a nutshell what Laugh-in was.You will note, in the late 80's, NBC (the same network that Laugh-In was on) came up with Saturday Night Live. It took up Laugh-In mantle without the joke wall or the quick SOCK IT TO ME!However, This small piece of the show on DVD isnt much, we need more! I rate it low, because it feels so incomplete...and for what it worth, it better to have NOTHING than a small taste of greatnessI would rather have a full season of Laugh-in. Since Rhino isnt making many DVDs lately...someone should!Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
1,"I totally agree. Laugh In is great, but where are the complete seasons?","Laugh In is one of my all time favorite comedy shows, but I would love to buy complete seasons of uncensored Laugh In starting with Season One. And above all, I never waste a dime on over priced DVDs that are half full or less.And I would also like lots of behind the scenes talks by the stars, writers, and producers about the making of, and censorship, and just how did they write so many hilarious jokes so fast?!!!"
4,a really Good Show,for it's time Period this Show was cutting edge&dealt with alot of topics.a wide range of guests came on board for the fun.Goldie Hawn has always been Fly to Me.some really funny stuff.
2,Save Your Money,"What a disappointment. If this is the ""best"" of Laugh In, then it should have never been on television to begin with."
3,Warning to Laugh-In First-Timers...,"I'd always heard about Laugh-In, but had never seen it (I was born in 1966). I went ahead and bought this set, on the strength of the positive reviews.In a nutshell? It's an interesting cultural experience - to see what people were talking about, laughing about. It's more political that I'd expected, and there are some very stylish elements. The packaging is also fun!Having said that, I never need to see another episode of Laugh-In. I have never heard such bad jokes on a show, or seen such relentlessly terrible slapstick. Sure, they offer disclaimers about how bad the jokes are, but it doesn't help. Fabulous comedic talents wasted in 7-second skits.And to read the liner notes and see the interviews, this was the Cadillac of shows at the time. Were people really that dumb?"
3,A lot of really dumb jokes,"Alan Sues is my dad's uncle, and soon after the DVDs were released, he sent them to us as a gift, and I'll say that I'm glad we got it for free. Many of the jokes, mostly during the ""Sock it to me"" segment, were pretty dumb. The show had its moments, usually in the cocktail room. My favorite cast members are Alan Sues(of course) and Arte Johnson."
1,Don't Get Bippied,Another Rhino rip-off. This should be the full season 1 at a lower price not a handful of episodes. If you think that this review is too short-kiss my bippy. If you are a fan of the show this is all you really need to know about the set. You know the rest. Shame on you Rhino.
2,Terribly dated and unfunny,"It is hard to believe that ""Laugh-in"" was once considered a groundbreaking, hip, wildly funny, and even controversial show. Seeing it now is painful. That is what happens when a show's humor is mostly topical. Jokes about Lyndon Johnson, birth control, and Viet Nam fall flatter than a pancake today. Then there are the large number of pointless one liners, short dumb sketches, scenes that go on too long, etc. This now seems about as hip as a Nehru jacket and love beads. Simply awful. You also know that a supposedly radical ""youth"" show has lost its sense of identity when it starts having lounge lizards such as Joey Bishop and Sammy Davis as guest stars. If you are thinking about buying this set because you remember it as a very funny show, be forewarned; it is no longer amusing."
2,a bungle,"Although there are outstanding qualities of style and characterization and quite interesting situations and relationships, I disliked the novel, because of an unusually unpleasant atmosphere, created mainly by the character of Frank Chapman, the evangelist fanatic.Also, I could not empathize with any of the characters."
3,Great cards - not great program,"First, I must say that the greeting cards really are good. There is a great selection and it's nice to be able to preview them - outside and in - before you actually pick a card.The reasons I dislike this program is that there is no ""Search"" function available for the graphics. You have to browse them on your own and hope you hit the jackpot for what you're looking for. There are some great graphics but it's very time consuming to have to browse through them all.Also, there was no way to print just one postcard - you print them all."
2,"Fair product, but company does NOT pay rebates. AVOID","The product itself is only fair. There are FAR better greeting card software products on the market, like Hallmarks and American Greetings. This one is clunky, and not professional looking. I bought this as a result of a rebate offer on Amazon to give it a try. BOY was I sorry. Over 10 weeks later and I am STILL waiting for the rebates to be paid, and I have encountered some of the WORST customer service I have ever experienced with Nova Development. No Wonder, turns out they have an F grade with the BBB and are the subject of numerous complaints with the Attorney General's office. My advice: Avoid ANY products by Nova Developement at all costs."
4,Greeting Cards without having to go to the store.,"I love being able to make my own cards. I've gotten pretty creative with pictures and this program makes it east to do. If you buy nice paper, they look just like a Hallmark Card and there is a lot of variety in styles.The only thing I don't like is that there is no choice for size, you have to use what the design says and sometimes I pick a design that I like but I think it would look nicer if I could do a regular 1/2 page card instead of the 1/4 size."
2,Disappointed,"I just order this product with fairly high reviews and was eager to received the program. Now that I have it, I don't like it!! We just purchased a brand new Dell computer and this is the first program we have installed on it. Well...it doesn't work correctly. I ran the printer wizard and the cards print out backwards. I saved a project I did and tried to re-open it and it told me the file was corrupt. Not!! Brand new computer, I don't think so!! The cards were nice, but I did not like the fact that there wasn't any other options to change the sayings in the card. You had to type your own, there were no other suggestions."
1,Ahhhhh.......please wake me when it's over....boooooring,"Another disappointment by this author. I couldn't stay awake while reading this. As I read, this book said the same thing over and over again. Very boring. No good information and definetly no learning experience involved. Blah blah blah. What's your point? This one definetly did not get the audiences attention."
2,Time to revisit this book again to correct the errors,"Once again we have the Post Trib camp stating that the pre-tribbers have got it wrong again. I believe that ""Woody"" needs to travel back to ""Infinity & beyond"" to recheck his facts. The New Testament as well as the Early Church Fathers up to approx 3rd Century taught imminence, that Christ would return at any moments, I am suprised that with all of Woody's ""research"" into the Catholic Church etc that he hadn't come across Origin and Augustine's move from the imminent to the post Tribulation or a-millenial view. Better off reading Arnold Frauchtenbaum on this issue.And to the rest of the Believing Christians, don't worry if you don't understand the Rapture, Us pre-tribbers will explain it to you on the way up."
1,Typical Distortion of the Rapture picture,"As is the case with just about every book attacking the whole concept of the Rapture in general - and specifically the concept of the pre-tribulational Rapture idea - the author commits the error of saying that the Rapture is somehow ""secret"" in the way it is presented to the American church. There is nothing secret about it; it is plainly taught in the New Testament. The only thing unknown about it concerns the timing debate, which is really the crux of the matter. Woodrow's title for the book suggests to the nominal reader that the Rapture concept was hatched up in secrecy by certain individuals who were not following scripture. Should anyone find the timing question difficult to accept (assuming it really is not known), they should consider what Jesus said in Matthew 24:44. For the Bible-believing Christian, Christ's words settle the matter."
5,All talent attention seeker,"How stupid to rate an album you've never heard. Listen to the album and then make up your mind about it, you won't be disappointed. The songs are little punk rock masterpieces, Kitty's voice has never sounded sexier or more assured. Even though the production tends to be a little inconsistent this still gets a perfect rating as the songs are just so strong and Kitty has more balls than you do.And as some of the members of the current G n R know about this album and happened to think the title was funny who are you to criticize? Buy it!"
3,"The product is cute, but is the price?","I purchased this skort last week and loved it. One thing wrong though, the price. They advertised it like it was a big name, sure it is but come on, I could have gone to Kohl's and got somthing that looked so much like that, you couldn't even tell the difference, for only $20.00. If I can return it I am, because honestly IT IS NOT WORTH IT...."
2,NOT tuning,"I was looking for a good resource on Linux system tuning. This book does NOT fill the bill. The word ""tuning"" doesn't even appear in the index!If you need help with installation options that go beyond the basic defaults, you'll find this book helpful.If you want to tune your Linux system for maximum performance, look elsewhere."
4,Good quality but expensive,"This is a good quality product for the dots and dashes paint. The only problem is that the paper tends to get pretty rigid after the paint is applied and dries. It is made of thicker paper, so maybe that is the reason. I wish that there were more pages included for the price. The book is used up pretty fast."
5,Waited a long time for this,"I just received Homicide - Life on the Street, seasons one and two as a birthday gift. What a GREAT GIFT!! I have viewed all 4 DVDs already. I have been waiting for them to offer the show on DVD for many years. I used to watch the re-runs on Court TV until they moved it to 1:00 a.m. I used to write to Court TV asking them to either air the show during a reasonable hour, or to offer DVDs to purchase. Finally, somebody listened. I think that over the years Homicide was truly one of the greatest shows.It was great to see Crosetti again. You can't help but giggle over his obsession with Lincoln; The Adena Watson Case; I could go on and on, but I think all of the shows were great.This set is truly worth every penny. I hope that we will not have to wait too long for the other seasons."
3,Homicide,"I cannot give a good review at this time.The Picture was good, but their was no close captioning available. I'm very hard of hearing, so I need that close-captioning with anything I watch. Thank You, Roberta Thies"
3,***NO CLOSED CAPTIONING WHATSOEVER***,"Content-wise the show deserves 5 stars.In terms of picture and sound quality, this set deserves no less than 4 stars.However, the biggest disappointment as it turns out is that there is not even closed captioning, much less subtitles.I discussed this issue at length with a few fans who happened to be hearing-impaired, and indeed they voiced their frustration. Those fans were deeply disappointed and felt like they were ignored/abandoned.While my own hearing is fine, I would hope A&E would be more sensitive towards the needs of hearing-impaired fans and proceed to add closed captioning to future releases."
3,Book Better,"The TV series ""Homicide - Life on the Streets"" is OK, even good in parts, for TV, but the book it is supposedly based on ""Homicide: A Year of Killing on the Streets"" by David Simon, is very much better, so the series was a disappointment to me."
1,Amazon Error: No CC or subtitles,"Amazon has a mistake in the specs for this set. There are *no* subtitles or CC - not in HDMI and not in S-Video, so if you are hearing impaired like we are then don't order the set.To add insult to injury the dealer of the used set is not responding to our repeated requests for assistance in the return.Very unusual for an Amazon dealer, but this one is just not responding - even after three requests.Maybe the dealer needs to see their name here in a review - in lights!"
4,Endless Street Police Story,"It is a long-long-long story of police detectives working endlessly to fight a crime surrounding and own personal problems.Personally, too long and DVD quality is worse than one of any full length part produced separately."
2,Slow going and boring.,I found this series very slow going and boring at times. It didn't keep the interest of my husband or I. Overacting.
1,You want THE SHIELD -- you DO NOT want THIS ONE,"Police dramas are a hobby of mine, both British and American. So many of them over the years have been anywhere from outstanding to poor, and this one is nothing but a yawner and money lost. The Sheild had something to say and a talented cast saying it, to the extent I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With Homicide, by contrast, I couldn't take my eyes off the DVD player's time reader, to determine whether I had seen enough to make a fair judgment. We might be friends now, because I just saved you $200. Avoid Ned Beatty's Homicide series. Consider instead The Sheild, A Touch of Frost (British) and Foyle's War (British) which I have also reviewed. Cheers."
1,Useful For Self-Flagellation,"A vile collection of nasty little stories about how cruelly the Irish treat one another. One gets the impression that the author likes to lie in bed at night rubbing his chest while imagining the indignities impoverished people go through, such is the level of cruelty and fetishistic suffering. Kurt Vonnegut believed it is important for a story to have at least one character the reader can root for; there is not a single one to be found in this book. Worst of all, there are no dreams and no lobsters."
4,A Good Read!,"This book makes several excellent points about strategy. To find them, the reader must slog through pages of unremitting, self-promotional hard-sell, snide digs at business guru Michael Porter and contemptuous asides about consulting firms that base their strategic recommendations on research. Readers will miss little if they skip the CEO interviews, which might have provided interesting and informative insights had the author not chosen to focus on compliments to himself and his firm. But the bullet-point outlines of the strategic thinking process will be an eye-opener for many managers unaccustomed to thinking in this manner, and the section is illustrated robustly with real-life examples. Robert’s analysis of the driving forces of various businesses makes the entire effort worthwhile. ...get this book for executives and entrepreneurs in any industry."
1,Sound quality was awful.,There is a hissing sound all the way through it. I should have ordered a more expensive one; you get what you pay for.
2,Haydn in a hurry!,"This interpretation is better than the stilted, controlled interpretations - but only slightly. There is no depth nor richness. Weil is in a hurry to get through each piece, and if you cough, you will miss your favorite part! It left my ears exhausted! Choose the Haydn Orchestra recording over this!"
1,"Indeed, Haydn in a hurry",I fully agree with the previous review - the tempi are by far too fast thus heavily dectracting from listening pleasure. Having heard this from the audio samples this will prevent me from buying this recording.
5,Classic lampoons of judicial decisons from Punch.,"Reissued in paperback in 1997, these knowing spoofs of British courts appeared 1940-1960. Madcap Englishmen litigate divorce, compulsory schooling, using a cow as a check, etc., before judges and law lords who are as idiosyncratic as the parties to the cases. (See Herbert's biography.)"
2,missing full details,"Purchased the kit to work with my CD changer. Does it function? Yes, and the sound quality seems fine. However, I never saw published any piece of information that indicated that my CD changer will have to play CD's while I'm listening to the mp3 player. In essence, my CD player's lifespan will be shortened because of this accessory. I sent an email to PIE about this and did not receive a response until my second email, one month later. Go buy a new head unit instead of this product!"
1,Worst shovel I ever Bought!,The first day I used it I BROKE IT!! Lowes shovels are BETTER GRADE!!! These shovels are over priced and under made .
3,Don't buy it; don't attempt to rely on it,"... of little use: briefs are short, shoddy ""analysis"" of major cases in most casebooks. Won't help much whether you have read or not for class."
4,The Classic War of the Worlds,"The most acturate telling of H.G. Wells novel. The setting is even in England and not in New Jersey , Spielberg's version. I have the three hour versin as well. I purchase this one to see what had been edited out and if the editing affected the original story line."
1,Bad.,"Just bad. I was hoping that the negative reviews were exaggerated, but I was wrong. Do not waste your time or your $2.99."
1,Maybe if it becomes a cult film......,"Relentless and grueling! We kept watching this film waiting.... and waiting... and waiting. We sat through the entire 3 hours wondering what it was all about. Decided that it was probably on the way to being a cult classic because it is truly weird. Imagine HG WELLS looking at this version....... A party film. Invite friends, have lots of snacks and beverages. A groupie delight!"
1,Review of The classic War of the Worlds,This movie reminds me of the David Lynch film of Dune. In both cases the movie makers have taken a classic and riveting story and made a movie of it which is nearly unwatchable. Shame on them both for creating something boring and superfluous from superb fiction.
1,Trash,Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. You have to make an effort to make something this bad. Three hours of my life wasted. I watched it last night and still cannot believe how bad the special efforts were. They look like a game from a Commodore 64 computer. The mustache looks plastic and appears like it came out of a Cracker Jack box. Incredible.
3,Review of THe classic War of the Worlds.,"Item arrived within expected time frame. Product was packaged well with no damage. Absolutely no complaints.I would reccommend this movie for anyone who has seen the 1953 version,all the other versions, read the different versions of the book and still can not get enough of the War of the Worlds scenario. It attempts to follow the original book and to some extent, it succeeds. The acting is terrible, the special effects are sometimes laughable and sometimes unexpectedly good. If you do not expect a high budget production, you may be pleasantly surprised. It's a bit longer than necessary but I found it fine for a rainy day when there was absolutely nothing else to do."
1,No need to see,"I was so excided about this movie before I saw. Now, disappointed so much. Idea as classic is very good. That is the reason why I bought this DVD. But that's it as some other guy said. Especialy music is obstacle, interference, distarbing me from the beginning to the end. I doubt about the director's sense to the movie. I was almost thinking that I should be watching a student film. I do not recommend to buy."
2,Not for me.,"This film didn't work for me, and maybe you should read other reviews for balance. I found the technical aspects lacking, and special effects weak. The acting wasn't bad, indeed, I saw efforts to play out 19th Century types, but other aspects of the visuals, like the artillery battery firing on the initial landers were so cheesy, I stopped watching half way through. The film did try to stay true to the original text, but that wasn't enough to keep my interest."
1,This movie sucks...,"I realized I purchased the ""wrong version"" in the first 5 minutes, that is all I've watched and will ever watch. Unfortunately, I am stuck with this awful film!"
3,Good account in one book,"After seeing the movie Glory I was curious to find out more about the Civil War siege of Charleston. This book certainly did the job of covering almost everything. The only area I thought it was lacking was in a fuller description of the effect of the sige on the civilian population there. On the other hand, some minor parts were covered in excessive, long winded detail-for example the history of the submarine Hunley. It also suffered from a bias towards the Confederate States-the plans , movements and units of the CSA are always covered in more deatil than those of the Federals, and while the Southerners are continually being praised for bravery, Union troops usually get none."
3,"The best I could find, but not great","This is a good book for learning Portuguese, but reads more like a workbook than a text. All the basic tenses and sentence structures are demonstrated, but they are never really explained. If you have never learned a second romance language before, you will likely find this book frustrating. However, if you know Italian, Spanish, or French, for example, you should be able to fill in the gaps and make good use of this book."
2,no cd,no cd to go along with the book! went online to find . cannot. guess you need a teacher who may have the cd.
5,five stars,"The premise of the movie is: zombies wandering around aimlessly at night in a movie theater in Taipei. The theater is analogous to life and the zombies are analogous to the people. This is a typical theme which Tsai likes to explore in his films.There are maybe five lines in the film, one of which I remember was something like, ""Sorry I am Japanese"". The movie playing inside the theater is set in dynastic China. I also remember a scene in a washroom where three men stood at a toilet smoking at the same time for around ten minutes, supposedly pissing the whole time.Bottom line: the movie is depressing as hell. DO NOT see it with a girl hoping to get laid after the movie! THIS IS NOT A DATE MOVIE!!! I can't emphasise that ENOUGH! And certainly do NOT see it if you're already depressed. There is also a bonus short film on the DVD. The same applies to that flm, too."
2,Very hard work,"I do not have anything much to add to the other reviews. This is a dissappointing film. It has one prizes and i watched it waiting to find out why. It is pretty but extraordinarly slow. It contains one idea, no plot and no dialogue. We seem to be invited to accept that this patent lack of substance in fact reflects a reality. Well perhaps it does not but not one that is worth spending more than an hour watching."
1,What is wrong with this movie?,"Okay. I'll make this short. This movie sucks, big time. I'd rather watch a Sound of thunder 100 times in a row. At least that movie has a plot. Be warned! My family and I left after bearing through the first hour. I'm suprised we lasted that long."
3,Will not fit in standard poster frames.,"I like the poster but didn't realize it was too big to fit any standard poster frames. Even off-centering the poster would require a bit of extra artistry (cutting, repositioning objects, pasting, etc...) Kind of frustrated but it's my own fault for not doing the research before buying the poster. Looking for a large enough frame is proving to be difficult so far also. I'm sure I'll eventually figure something out but it's extra time I didn't want to spend for the $20 poster when some of the cheaper posters would've fit the frame just fine... =ZStandard frame sizes seem to end at 24x36 unless you want to spend a lot of money..."
5,Privacy window film review,"The 48"" x 100' frosted white privacy window film was exactly what I expected. It was exactly as portrayed and at a good price."
1,Not what you think,Don't bother it is the same skills in any of his dvd's nothing new or inciteful here.
3,A great instructor,"I always like the AJ instruction.It was a good review but I saw most of it in AJ reveals the truths about golf,so if you have this series don't get it."
3,Just Basic,"However you look at it, Juice is a basic thriller about power and respect in Harlem. The cast is irreputable, but I can't help but feel that the script needed a little work. Raheem (Khali Kain) was a pretty decent character and could've added more depth into the film, but his random death steered the plot into a war between two characters, Quincy (Omar Epps) and Bishop (Tupac Shaqur).The opening of the film was impactful, catching the traits of four friends and their personalities. It resembled an East-Coast version of Boyz 'N' The Hood, with stereotypes, charismatic ensemble cast and a dynamic setting. The characters' bonds were phenomenal, but a brief monologue could've been presented.Again, a great cast, but analysing it further, every character in Juice had the potential to be more than they were."
3,Too Crazy for me,I don't go for movies like this. It's like any other R rated movie set in the hood scene in the city.
4,Great pac movie,"Instant classic, story is good and the parts of the movie were over the top but seriously, this movie is good, pac played a perfect jackyl/Hyde character very well."
5,THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC.,"YO THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST BLACK FILM I HAVE EVER SEEEN. I LOVE TUPAC AND HE LIVES FOREVER IN MY HEART. OMAR EPPS(Q) WAS ALRIGHT TOO WHEN PAC (BISHOP) WAS AFTER HIM. PAC WAS WRONG TO HAVE FLIPPED OUT ON ALL OF HIS FRIENDS AND ALL BUT HEY, HE DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO."
3,Disappointing...,"This movie only made me appreciate the far superior craft, cast, and directing of ""Boyz N The Hood"" and ""New Jack City."" It's not awful, but not very good either.Slow pacing, predictable plot, high-school-level acting and dialogue made this feel a lot longer than it actually was. Even the few fight/action scenes were clumsily done, especially the convenience store robbery. Just zero tension or punch.The film has some good intentions (mainly to show the plight of inner city low income teens, how easily they can fall into trouble in that environment) but good intentions cannot save a poorly executed work like this."
4,OVER ALL- THUMBS UP,"I LIKED THIS MOVE BECAUSE IT IS AN INTERESTING STORY, THESE KIDS FROM HARLEM WHO DISOBAY AND DISRESPECT AND GET INTO TROUBLE. tHEY ROB A STORE AND KILL THE OWNER. SOME FEEL POWERFUL, WHILE SOME FEEL GUILTY. THAT ""NOTHING CAN COME BETEEN US"" FALLS APART, AS (TUPAC'S CHARACTER) GOES INSANE WITH THIS NEW POWER. IN THE END, ONLY TWO REMAIN AS A FIGHT TILL DEATH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL. WHOMEVER WINS- HAS ALL THE JUICE. ""ALL THE HOOD RESPECT""I FOUND THIS TO BE A CLEVER STORY... SOME PARTS FUNNY... LOTS OF CATCHY PHRASES... ACTING IS BELIEVABLE, THESE COULD BE KIDS FROM SOMEWHERE GOING THROUGH THIS HIARARCHY OF DOMINANCE. HAPPENS EVERYWHERE. AND I GOT INTO IT AND FOUND MYSELF ROOTING FOR A SIDE."
2,Movie good - Disc bad,"This is not about the movie. I didn't open till a week later, and found that the dvd was damaged (unplayable, dent in the disc)"
2,Ok.,The movie was okay the only person in this movie worth seeing was Tupac himself. Other then that its pretty boring and short. So far the only movie worth seeing for this genre is Menace To Society.
5,good acting,"Tupac's first movie which made him a movie star. Bishop, all he wants is respect he's tired of running from cops, old man that runs his store and always come's out with that little gun if he see's gang bangers outside his store. He's also tired of being bullied by this latin gang. Q on the other hand has a bright future he can D.J. and expects to make a career out of it."
4,Brilliant Film..Serious Stuff,"Tupac is brilliant in this film alongside Omar epps.This is a great example of Harlem Life. the word JUICE is very Powerful. This film is a classic. If you Like Black Action cinema such as Boyz N the hood, Menace 2 Society then you must watch Juice"
2,Not What I Expected But Okay,"I was starting high school when Juice came out. This movie had the hottest looking brothers in the world in it! Omar Epps was dazzling and I've always loved his work. Tupac brought that special presence to a film as he did his songs. Khalil Kain ( the most ignored actor on the planet ) did great too, but once again never got his props. To break it down Juice is just about four friends who decide to knock off a store for no reason at all. The actions didn't match Omar's character. He was the straight laced one and cared too much about his music, so it didn't make sense that he'd go along with this. The writing wasn't as good as "" Boyz In Da Hood "" or "" New Jack City "". Juice IS entertaining but gets tired a little too fast. Good soundtrack though."
3,Nuff respect due!,"The work and effort displayed in this modification of ""JUICE"" on to DVD has the same characteristics of a lazy teenager who parents had asked to wash the dishes before leaving the house! It's still a ghetto classic of a movie but ,what happened to the behind the scenes? Music videos? Director's commentary? There's nothing more here on this disc than the movie and scene selections. I am embarrassed to have added this to my DVD collection. My intentions are not to mislead y'all ,I knew about the disc contents way before I ordered . Damn I should've waited for the 25th anniversary of this released on Dvd. To those who chose not to purchase this disc ,you got the ""juice"" now ! Those who are , BAYOR ( buy at your own risk)!"
4,Definetely a thought provoking movie,"This movie came after Boyz N The Hood but before Menace II Society, so hood movies weren't real common. This movie has four friends, and how their quest for Juice, or respect, destroys all but one of the friends. Tupac Shakur furnishes a powerful performance as Bishop, the ""thug"" of the group. As a music fan, I didn't think Pac could act this well, but I was amazed. He really comes across as so intense. It also shows you the tough choices that kids really have in these places, like the ghettos of Harlem or Brooklyn. Plus, you don't see many NYC based ""hood"" films. Even if you don't really like Tupac, this is an important, eye-opening movie. It shows just where an outwards quest for respect can lead you, not just in the violence context but in all aspects of life. A must see."
4,Juice,"Juice 1992R94 minutesFour Harlem homeboys kick their troublesome habits up a notch in this intense urban drama. Torn between his dream of becoming a rap DJ and his devotion to his friends, ""Q"" (Omar Epps) gets pressured into a store robbery instigated by Bishop (Tupac Shakur). But a quest for respect and power leads to disaster when the game plan goes awry and their lives change forever. Samuel L. Jackson shines in a bit part as a billiards hall proprietor.Cast:Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Jermaine ""Huggy"" Hopkins, Khalil Kain, Cindy Herron, Vincent Laresca, Samuel L. Jackson, George O. Gore, Grace Garland, Queen Latifah, Idina Harris, Victor Campos, Eric Payne Director:Ernest R. Dickerson Genres:Action & Adventure, Dramas, Action Thrillers, Crime Action & Adventure, Crime Dramas This movie is:Gritty, Suspensefulgood movie in all i do reviews and stuff at [...]"
3,Get it for one thing,"This version of Mississippi Queen is not the 2:33 studio cut but a 4:13 live version. The long solo is good but a bit sloppy and West improvises some of the lyrics (or was just too drunk to remember them); nevertheless, worth hearing. The selections are a hodgepodge, so the music doesn't flow from track to track. The recording is not remastered but the sound is acceptable and for $6.98 a bargain if you need these songs in your collection.Recording length: about 45 minutes"
3,Fight Card,Lee King vs. Nick GonzalezAlfred Escobedo vs. Angel EspinoTy Baker Jose vs. Luis MunozJody Draper vs. Conor BrantleyChris Bowles vs. Devon MillerSteve Jimenez vs. Xavier MejiaRandy Hauer vs. Adam ArredondoRocky Long Svs. cott JohnsonMarvin Eastman vs. Antony Rea
2,NOT A DVD!!!,"I've been looking for this movie for years, it's so classic Jack Lemo and Julie Andrews , but is personalized cuz the children of the stars have staring roles, too. However, I did not even consider that this movie is not in DVD form, so I can't view it. The Joke's on ME!!!"
5,that's life,"I don't understand WHY this wonderful movie is NOT ON DVD for the world to see.I LOVE THIS MOVIES..I cried,laugh. why is it ALL good movie people never get a chance to see. PLEASE HURRY AND MAKE IT SO I CAN BUY THIS MOVIE. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES AND I HAVE TO HAVE IT. I can't afford to buy it for the price your asking for..."
2,Don't buy a DVD copy...this was never released on DVD.,"This film, a very personal one, from director Blake Edwards is charming, engaging and a gem for any fans of Edwards, his wife, Julie Andrews and/or his good friend, Jack Lemmon. The problem is: there are unscrupulous sellers who are selling DVD copies of this film that are poorly copied. THAT'S LIFE has never been released on DVD, so any copies in this format are pirated and were scanned from other formats. DON'T BE FOOLED."
2,Will the real Julie Andrews stand up?,"Being a Julie fan, I wanted to start collecting some of her movies. This one I didn't have. Upon watching it, I found myself Fast-Forwarding through most of it because of the language (her husband). The movie has a wonderful story behind it but it really bothered me when I heard Julie spoke some language herself in one part of the movie. Definitely not a family movie."
2,Poor DVD version,"This is a great movie but unfortunately this DVD version is very poor indeed. The picture quality is sad. It seems all that was done was the transfer of the video print on to DVD. The picture is even un-steady during the final credits scene. The sound is mono. No extras to this DVD at all. If you own the video of this film don't bother to purchase this DVD. On top of all of this, the price of this DVD is the same as most other DVDs that contain remastered prints, stereo sound, and extras. This is a very good film and it deserves a quality release, not this cheaply done version."
1,A pan and scan disaster!,"If ever there was a movie director in Hollywood who knew how to use the ""scope"" aspect ratio to perfection, it's Blake Edwards! So when Pioneer/Artisan decided to release this very interesting film in pan and scan format only, they managed to ruin it completely! Every single camera setup clearly tells me that this was not the vision of Mr. Edwards and his camera crew, so why bother to watch? As far as I'm concerned, I find this DVD defective, and - thankfully - that is also the opinion of my dealer. A big boo to Pioneer and Artisan!"
3,Grow up already,"Jack Lemmon plays a character who is reaching his 6oth birthday and is convinced he's dying. He becomes sort of a raving spoiled maniac, totally neglecting his long-suffering wife (Julie Andrews) who really IS dying and knows it but keeps it to herself. (Kind of; the ending is a bit of a surprise.) Lemmon's antics seem to go on too long and become tiring, and Andrews's stoicism is a bit too strong to believe. But the movie is effective in spots and is not a total disaster."
4,Another surfer singing mellow tunes,"The ability to preview songs before purchasing a CD makes it less likely that you will be seriously disappointed in the music when it arrives. Still, you don't get the full flavor of many songs with those 30-second samples. If you can get over the performer's first name and all the juvenile images it conjures up, you will probably enjoy the easy-going tunes and fresh sound of this indie artist. Don't expect to find deep lyrics or a song you can't live without...just a sincere voice and nice music to listen to from time to time."
1,Buyers be Cautioned !,"Don't make the same mistake I did, and buy an inferior product from Frontier Labs. From the first day it would freeze or lockup. I tried several different compact flash cards without success. Customer service was limited to generic email responses that implied I didn't have the technical ability to operate their equipment. Never could make it work. Don't buy anything from Frontier Labs, there are too many good MP3 players out there to have to deal with poor quality equipment and lousy customer support."
3,A Passable Book,"Not an extraorinarily charming book as the reviews suggest, just passable. The flow of the book suggests discontinuity . Some interesting and amusing facts have been mentioned."
5,Another excellent book from Lonely Planet,This is the second book I am reading from the Lonely Planet Journeys. The first was Jeff Greenwald's Shopping for Buddhas (1996). I found both of them to be excellent. Recommended as a fun-time reading as well as a gift to friends. Ana's writing of her memories and trip to Iran is very charming. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it.
4,This game is really good!,"This game is a whole lot of fun! It finaly has 4 player! ( I know, I didn't spell it right.) It is great fun but they're afew problems. One problem is that there isn't a aceleration button, so you run into walls. Also the turning is bad. And the stories are pretty short. I beat the hero one in one day! Also, WHAT ABOUT SHADOW!?!?!?!?!?"
2,Sonic Riders not all hyped up as portrayed,"Ok, tell me the commercial doesnt make ya want to buy this game. Tell me that the back of the box dosent look cool. Tell me that the phrase ""Try to keep up!"" isnt catchy. Perfect game for Sonic fans right? Wrong. This game is lame in all actuality. The controls- loose. The gameplay- horrifying. The storyboard- so lame its embarrising. I wasted $40 on this junk expecting some cool Sonic racing game as the media portrays. I tried to sell this at school and the highest offer I got was $3. Yeah. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this."
5,DA BOMB,"Does who says this game suck are @$$holes. You bulls**t. This rocks. The graphics are the best of all! Hey I know the amount of air you get by doing tricks is hard, but I'll list it for you. It's from lowest to highest.Key: GD= good landing, BD= bad landing TCS= tilt the control StickRank Air How to get:C 20 Any amount of tricks but BDR 30 Perform 1 trick and GDH 40 Perform 3 tricks by TCS rightHH 45 Perform 2-3 tricksS 50 Perform 3 tricks TCS StraightSS 60 Perform 3-5 tricksX 100 Perform 5+ tricksAs you can see, these are the trick ranking.

5,Funny,I'd played this game for months and still can't put the controller down. My favorite part is when the player attacks another character and they lose rings. I attack mostly AiAi and Ulala. Unlock eggman** and get him to level three (60 rings) and then attack a opponant. He farts at them. I'M NOT KIDDING. The fart is green. They smell it and scatter their rings.I love to see rings scatter anywhere (especially in this game).** Must finish Bablyon story to unlock eggman.
5,Spectacular!,"This games unique racing method really makes it awesome. You get to perform cool stunts, take cool shortcuts unlock great charchters like Aiai, NiGHTS, and rogue plus many more. This will keep you entertained for a very ling time. Buy Now!!"
3,"Good standard textbook, many examples, good for beginners to the field","This book is typical for all books of the Greiner series.It contains lots of solved sample problems scattered throughout the text. It has a readable, nice style but there are many unnecessary typing errors. All in all this is a readable book for beginners but nothing special."
3,Learning!!,"Received in timely fashion without delay. Reasonable price. Perfect condition, especially for a used book. Required reading for me as directed by my wife since she's reading the Japanese version of this book and had to find it for me. I give her Da Vinci Code and she gives me study material!!"
2,wrong choice on my part.,"I just bought this because I am trying to get everything that David Gilmour of Pink Floyd has done. I failed to notice that this man is David GILMORE.There is nothing wrong with the product at all, it's just not what I was seeking."
4,Hola Muchachos,"LES FUE MUY BIEN EN SUS DISCOS. ME ENCANTAN TODAS SUS CANCIONES, ESPECIALMENTE LA DE MI AMULETO ERES TU. LOS FUI A VER EN EL O.K CORRAL NORTH. CANTARON BIEN BONITO Y CANTARON MI CANCION. BUENO PUES ESO ES TODO. HOJALA QUE LES VALA BIEN.MUCHA SUERTE,SU FAN #1, KARINA TRUJILLO"
5,Leslie West is THE BEST,awesome guitar work Great band one of the best ever ! a sound like no other Raw beautiful ! What Rock should be !
4,This Wheels on Fire,"While everyone was into Woodstock, I was into this music. Leslie has tremendous talent and did receive a lot of help from Pappalardi (producer of Cream's Wheels of Fire LP). It is a classic and led Mountain on to several great LPs. Listen to Mountain Climbing for Mississippi Queen and Roll Over Beethoven live . Tremendous . This is their starter lp and pretty damn good for 69."
4,Gorgeous junkfood.,"Alas, the whole is less than the parts. Promised Land is a beautifully filmed, well acted, heartbreaking story with an absolutely fabulous score by the always excellent James Newton Howard. Its just that the material--the story itself--isn't worthy of such gorgeous cinematography and fine performances. Storywise, its pretty much junk but what raises it up are some really (visually) beautiful scenes."
4,The American Dream,"The American Dream is something different for everyone and cannot easily be defined. This film does a pretty fair job on debunking the generalized commonly accepted myth of the standard American Dream theory, espeially as it is based on true events. James Newton Howard was just starting back then and his brilliance shines through magnificently in his score. The film craft itself beautifully rendered, well acted and is to me well balanced and paced for the subject matter. I have to dust it off every once in awhile to remind myself what the potentials and pitfalls of being American is all about."
3,It's cute,"It's a cute movie....I remember it being a lot better when I was younger. Nevertheless, it's enjoyable and a good movie."
1,"Horrible, disgusting, sad...",I think a lot of us enjoyed this movie when we were very young but revisiting it years later you realize how sick and disturbing this movie really is. Poor helpless animals being thrown around and put in situations where they were obviously injured or worse is NOT entertainment to a normal person. Research the movie a little more and learn about it's origins and think hard about your decision to pass this on to a new generation.
5,Wonderful Family Movie,"My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie. I actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car when while traveling. My husband and I originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can share it with our own kids now. If you love animals, this movie is for you. The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to make and I believe it. It's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other. This has got to be one of the best animal films out there."
5,A DOG AND A CAT WHO WERE FRIENDS AS A PUPPY AND KITTEN,A cat and a dog who knew each other as a puppy and a kitten end up on a wild adventure and stay together.
1,Animal cruelty,I can't understand how anyone would support or write a glowing review about a movie in which animals were certain injured and/or killed during filming. Atrocious. Go with Homeward Bound instead -- do not buy this film.
1,Animal cruelty ??!!,"Watch the movie and then please tell me that these animals weren't abused...If you are an ""animal lover "" then do not promote buying this film."
1,"If animal abuse disturbs you, then close your eyes to watch.","Not having the fantesy imagination of a child, I watched this movie feeling very disturbed by the prominent animal abuse thoughout it. I saw nothing ""cute"" about a kitten getting bit on the lip by a crab, or floating down a river in a box and over a waterfall, with a look of dispair. Not to mention the puppy being ""forced"" to fight a black bear. There was no ""trick photography"" to this movie. What you see is what you get. I had to shut it off half way through. I couldn't deal with it. I would not consider this family entertainment!"
1,Terrible,"I loved this movie as a kid, when I watched it again as an adult I was seriously horrified. I don't know why so many people won't accept the facts, they abused and PROBABLY killed quite a few of those cats. :/Don't support this movie."
1,"Ok, now I feel terrible","I bought this movie at target for $5 for my son remembering how much I loved it as a kid. He has watched it a couple of times and adores it, and I thought it was a benign kid's film. My husband and I were suspicious about how they got the animal to perform such tasks but assummed they had trained animals to do it all. Recently, my friend told me that the film was filmed in Japan and as many as 30 cats were killed or harmed in the making. It is all starting to make sense now! I wish I could take it back because I feel awful having given my money to a movie that was cruel to animals."
1,"Cute at times, but the abuse to the animals can't be ignored","It's really hard to say anything bad about the movie because of the cute storyline, and the cute action caught on film of the animals, but CUTE doesn't cut it when you realize the animals are being abused. There aren't any special effects here, the animals are mistreated, and it is shocking. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, and the copy I own is going in the trashcan."
1,How many animals gave their lives to make this film?,"It's incredible that so many mindless, ignorant viewers think this is a ""family movie!"" Check out this snuff film. It's amazing. How did those poor animals live through all those stunts? They didn't. The makers of the film obviously got identical animals to replace the dead ones. Rent it, it's worth an open-mouthed gawk. Then, review it here."
1,Milo and Otis,This movie does not have the animal talking in it. It is a tape over of some guy reading the story. Ugh. Waste of money.
1,Not yet received,I would love to give feedback on my recently ordered movie Milo & Otis but unfortunately since my order was placed on the 8th December 2007 I have still not received the DVD as of 10th Jan 2008.
2,Great disturbing movie,"I used to love this movie as a kid, and found nothing wrong with it. Now I realize that this movie is horible becuase they kill cats. The director is rumored to have eaten 2 of the cats."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I loved it when it came out years ago. I love it just as much if not more now because my 3 year old thinks it is the coolest movie ever. He laughs his little fanny off at all the animal antics, every time he watches it. It just never gets old for him.The only problem is that since we have a dog, now he wants a cat. I don't like cats."
4,A great adventure,A friend gave me this film for my 21/2 to watch. Not being into animal films I put the video on the shelf. About a month later my son found it & put it on. I was instantly involved. I don't know why I didn't watch it sooner. It is not your typical heart-warming animal film (although it IS heart-warming). It is excitement from beginning to end. There is a huge variety of animal featured in this film so if nothing else it is a great way to introduce kids to all kinds of animals. I found myself yelling out & getting involved with the numerous adventures Milo & Otis find themselves in. The narrationis fun & doesn't take away from the animals at all. A real adventure film that IS cute without being cutsie.
5,Entertaining and good natured despite controversy,"Despite the fact that they threw the cat in the river, had about hundred birds peck wildly at him, chucked him off a cliff and other inhumane things and what not that caused so much controversy, this remains a good film. The film, which originally was meant for a Japanese(!) audience, was well crafted into a upbeat American feature with a fantastic narration by Dudley Moore."
5,The best movie ever!!!,This is the cutest and best movie ever!!! I give the highest possible reccomendation!!!
4,THE ADVENTURES OF MILO & OTIS!,"MILO is a dog and OTIS is a cat whose outrageous ADVENTURES are narrated by DULDEY MOORE! Set in JAPAN, your KIDS will LAUGH as they see how much trouble a dog and cat can get. Which is a LOT! Yes, this film was originally made in Japanese! You see, ONCE UPON A TIME, Milo and Otis grew up on the same farm, living HAPPY lives! Then they get separated and set off on an epic JOURNEY to find each other! THRILL as Milo and Otis cross over mountains and snow-covered landscapes searching for one another! A WONDERFUL tale of TRUE FRIENDSHIP! So what is they are ""just"" ANIMALS! This is one of the those great Disney films that Disney did not make!"
4,GREAT KIDS MOVIE!,"I've been watching this since I was 3! Great movie! You'll love to see Milo&Otis grow up together and face many adventures! Cool narrarator! Watch it, and you'll be singing too!"
5,awesome,"I think I've seen this movie over 50 times, and I laugh out loud at the same spots every single time!"
4,Cute,Cute movie for my grandchildren. Found myself getting involved as well. A little long for the little ones. But even they are entertained and finish watching it at another time.
4,Cute movie,I got this movie for my son(2) after my husband insisted on getting it. It was a cute movie with real animals but there is a narrator doing all the voices which I didn't expect. There is a scene where they show a live birth of puppies and kittens. It was a little weird and kinda gross so older children might have some questions about that scene. The rest of it was cute.
2,Mixed feelings,"When I first saw this movie, I was rather young, and was completely enthralled by it. Most people in my family loved it as well, and what's not to like about a friendship between a cat and a dog?Years later, with an adult perspective, I now see the danger the animals were put in. The claim added to the movie was that the animals were taken care of, but there is never a codicil of 'no animals were harmed, period'. Investigations of animal cruelty turned up cold without any definitive evidence because the Japanese were evasive in their comments. When I was little, I would have given it five stars, but now knowing the dark story and very much possible animal cruelty/deaths behind the film, my conscience will not let me give it any higher than a two."
2,Did not enjoy,I am an adult and usually enjoy movies regarding animals. This one was dull and boring to me. I will probably give it to a child in hopes they may enjoy it.
1,Disturbing,"Most of the reviews of this movie here are very positive....however I have to agree with the nay sayers...unless its a purely animated movie...such as 'Ice Age'...one of my favorites...I don't care for live action films that personify animals like people...not a good message for kids...as I had a couple of bad experiences with pets as aThe Adventures of Milo & Otischild...before I knew better...I am not saying that animals where hurt or even killed in this movie....but just watch that scene where Milo is in the box going down the rapids...you can see the cat mewing in terrified distress...I have a female orange tabby that looks very much like Milo...if anyone treated her that way!...well, I would be very upset...This film is not for kids at all!...however I do recommend it for adults to watch and see how animals can be mistreated...watch the movie carefully...and don't give in to the cuteness...better to just observe and love your own pets with your children"
3,"Very cute, but made us concerned for the animals","This movie is very cute! It is sweet and entertaining, but I have to say, my fiance and I were very concerned about the treatment of the animals. Some people say it is ""fake"" but I don't think so. They didn't have that kind of technology in 1986, did they? If so, good job on a realistic depiction of a pug being smacked by a bear, or a cat being attacked by seagulls and falling off a cliff. :-o"
4,"Fantastic soundtrack, great movie, very compelling.","This movie is very compelling. It was well directed and written. Dudley Moore adds a very interesting element with his narration. I would be interested in seeing the original Japaneese version of this movie.I thought the best part of this movie was the soundtrack. I would almost be willing to sell some minor organs to find out what the songs were, and who wrote them. I know most if not all of them are classical pieces. The main theme song is ""Of Foreign Lands and People"" by Robert Schumann. This movie also contains ""Appalachian Spring"" by Arron Copland. I have heard it also has Chopin, Debussy, and others. Unfortunatley no soundtrack was ever released for this movie. Too bad. I may never know what some of those songs were."
5,Excellent!!,"It is not every day that the children have nice heart-warming movies that teach them loyalty and friendship. My 7 yr old loves this movie, as does my 2 yr old. (Animals seem to attract all ages of children, even though the little guy doesn't understand the story yet). This definitely ranks way above Pokemon!"
4,Entertain the Kids!,"Kids are crazy about pugs because they are the perfect size! And the adventures of Milo and Otis will keep your kids....or in our case visiting kids busy and happily entertained! Not to mention our pugs enjoy watching it every now and then!Great movie for family viewing or a rainy day when there is ""nothing to do."""
5,What Mother Can't Love Those Faces!,"Milo and Otis is an absolutely adorable movie! I own a pug and let me tell you that Otis's mannerisms and the way he behaves is very true to the breed. Otis is very ornery and gets into so many things, just like pugs really do. I felt so bad and wanted to cry when he got stuck out in the snow towards the end of the movie. I am very glad that he made a friend in Milo and their travels together will warm the coldest of hearts. The end is a perfect end to their travels and now there is not just two of them anymore!"
5,A delightful friendship,"Milo, a marmalade farm kitten, is a trial to his mother from the day he first begins to wander about the yard. His feline curiosity and an inborn gift for mischief land him in trouble again and again. But his greatest adventure comes after he has made his one great friendship, with Otis, the solemn little pug. One day Milo steps into a wooden crate and floats off down the river. Without hesitation, Otis follows, racing along the bank in hopes of rescuing his buddy. Through muck and mud, bears and waterfalls, and other hazards, Milo remains upbeat and Otis faithful. And when at last, far from home, they're reunited and begin their homeward trek, they even end up finding the loves of their lives. Narrated by Dudley Moore, who does the animals' speech as if reading from a book, this is a sweet, funny, touching family-friendly tale of friendship, loyalty, and love."
2,A movie from my childhood,"This is one movie I remember from my childhood and I'm sure that there's other ASNers that remember this movie quite well. For those who haven't seen this movie it's about a cat and dog, but it's just all animals and no people featured in the movie, it's only narrated throughout the movie. Watching it now, it seems like it hasn't aged that well to me anyways and I don't mean that it's still a good kids or family movie whichever you want to label this movie as. Not only that but it's a little short at least I think it is in some way. Overall I give The Adventures of Milo & Otis 2 stars out of 5."
2,cute movie but fricken sad,there were rumors that animals were abused while filming. and i actually believe them. it all looks to real when the cat or pug are attacked by something
5,Milo and Otis..... what needs to be said?,one of the best movies of all time! every kid should have this to watch! I really don't think anything needs to be said about the movie itself haha.
5,Great movie,My daughter watches this movie over and over again. I have the DVD. And I have it on my phone a d kindle.
4,Awesome story for all ages,"For the film, all I can say is, awesome. This is my favorite childhood movie, funny and touching.Why only 4 stars? The movie itself is 5 stars easily. 4 star rating was based on the DVD. The US film producers thought that the French language track was really needed at all? What about the people that actually want to see the film with the original language track? What would it take to add that to a DVD rather than add French, who have probably the same population as the Japanese here. Why the hell don't they have the original Japanese language track?!?!?! Hell, they don't even add original Japanese subtitles. I honestly hate when I want a foreign film and it has been stripped for no good reason."
5,How innocent and joyful,"How can you go wrong with this sweet, endearing film these days? Who doesn't need to relax to this innocence and simple humor? My 10-year-old even told our 5-year-old friend, ""actually, it's pretty good"". Dudley Moore is narrating and if you've ever seen the Really Wild Animals series you'll know that he does a great job and is humorous in tone and inflection alone. Very sweet movie."
2,Animal welfare too questionable,"I rewatched part of this with my daughter recently. This was a favorite as a child but as an adult I can't ignore that these animals seem in very real distress during scenes ( kitten falling over waterfall, pinched by crab , attacked by sea gulls and more). The allegations of animal abuse are easy to see in the film and I can't be entertained when I feel bad for the animals.This is a wonderful fantasy story but cannot be told by real animals in a humane way"
5,Milo & Otis is very entertaining for little ones,"Loved by my 3 year old nephew. It was a gift he has watched it many, many times. I had checked it out local library so many times I was sure watching this DVD would get old, but not yet. Well worth the money."
1,"ANIMAL TORTURE DISGUISED AS ""FAMILY"" ENTERTAINMENT","If this were an animated film this would be passable entertainment, but it is not. It is real, and what are you watching is wholesale animal abuse. See, in real life staged films usually require MULTIPLE takes to ""get the shot right""; perhaps the angles aren't good enough to use, whatever. All throughout, I kept wondering what horrors the crew was doing behind the camera to get the animals to do what they wanted. If you were utterly naive about the ways of the world and viewed this picture with innocent eyes you might find it cute, after all you have dainty music, deceptive editing, and the charming narration of Dudley Moore. That is the magic of post-production. I'm no animal rights fascist, but this is beyond the pale. Misery is so clear and evident upon the faces of the dog and cat. This is a ghastly production."
2,A little disappointed.,I was excited when I found this item on the human kinetics website. I could not order it from that website because of some issue with the credit card purchasing system there so I ordered it through Amazon. I recieved the DVD fairly quickly but was disappointed to find out that the Amazon offer did not include the book also which was part of the package from Human Kinetics. They were both the same price.
3,First book with the title Project Management,"This is the first book with the title Project Management, its a hard to find book, I bought it for my collection of project management books and the fact that the book is as old as I am."
1,No Star,The flag that arrived did not have the red star in the center. It seems to be some sort of upside-down Dutch flag.
3,Eh....,"I gave this a whirl because Amazon had a GREAT sale on it and the reviews were favorable. It IS good, but it's just flavored popcorn. I like it better than the average caramel corn variety (the SinNamon IS very good), but not enough to buy it in bulk again. If you are a caramel corn/flavored popcorn aficionado, then this is probably the product you've been looking for. For the average consumer who likes caramel corn/flavored popcorn occasionally, not so much. I must say though, I love the clever name!"
2,latest delivery from Lesser Evil below par in quality,"Our office has ordered Lesser Evil popcorn several times through Amazon.We were surprised and disappointed in our last case. Several of the boxes of popcorn were stale, to the extent that kernals of popcorn congealed into a ball.I'm wondering if Lesser Evil 's manufacturing process experienced an isolated glitch or if this is an indication of Lesser Evil's forthcoming product quality.At this point, while we like the popcorn a lot, we're hesitant to order again."
4,FINGER CRAYONS,"I use these crayons as whole hand crayons with kids who have trouble with grasp. They have good color, are easy to mark with. I wish they weren't hollow because they break very easily."
2,Smells and fragile,"I bought these crayons for my son to refine his tripod grasp and to provide a fun new crayon. To my horror, these things have a faint chemical smell. That can't be good. They also are easily broken if you have a rough toddler(26mths) boy such as mine. That said, he loves them. He likes stacking them, counting them, coloring with them, and even pretending he is making ice cream cones with them. I would not buy these again, despite him liking them. I can't get over the chemical smell and the lack of durability considering the age group they are marketed to."
2,Not our favorites,"The shape is a cool concept, but my little guy doesn't seem to have an easier time grasping these than any other type of crayons. Moreover, these take a lot of pressure to make marks, and the marks are never as vibrant as other crayons. I think they actually make better stacking toys than crayons, but of course then they have the significant drawback of making marks on everything. They don't break easily, but when they do break the pieces become very difficult to draw with.I would skip these and go for triangular beeswax crayons instead: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005YWG5VM/ref=wms_ohs_product"
2,Disappointed in durablity,I bought these for daycare and was disappointed because the tips are hollow so the break very easily. It would be a great product if they had solid tips. The colors are nice and the children don't seem to have a hard time using them. Just don't last very long. Won't buy them again.
3,Great Product but Tough Disc Slide In's,I really enjoy my organizer but its impractical to use all the cd slots. Whenever I try to use all the slots I feel like my hands are being used as pliers to insert and take them out.
4,Urban Cowboy,Had not viewed this flick in 10 years. In the last 2 months have seen it three times and enjoy it more with each viewing. JT seems to encapsulate an era (ie Saturday Night Fever) this movie and CD will not let you down. A must have for 70's survivors!B Fig.
3,LOOKING FOR LOVE IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES,"I am someone who would rather watch ""Urban Cowboy"" than ""Saturday Night Fever"". Maybe because it doesn't feel as dated as SNF?..I don't know. It is a more entertaining film to me. I know this movie has taken a lot of flack, but it is one of those films you can watch once in a while. The DVD transfer is good, but a very weak release in the way of extras."
1,Urban Cowboy from the UK,I got this movie and cannot play it because of invalid region. There should have been a disclaimer that the dvd would not work outside of the UK.
5,Rare Laserdiscs - dvds Movies Collector.,"I enjoyed Urban Cowboy on dvd,I am not john Travolta's Fan but I have his Collection on laserdiscs and dvds including Saturday Night Fever,Grease,Stayin' Alive,Urban Cowboy is one of his greatest movies,Go get The dvd you wont regret it :)"
3,classic,"Bought this dvd for my gf - one of her alltime favorites! Classic Travolta and Winger. A bit cheesy for me, but I guess that's part of the charm of the movie."
2,From One Abusive Man to Another and Back,"I realize that Travolta was at the height of his stardom and Winger was an up-and-coming and talented actress. I also realize that the honky-tonk mechanical bull-riding mentality had its season of popularity.Even so, it is horrifying to me that a popular cable station describes Bud as a ""good old boy"" when he hit Sissy twice. One abusive incident would have been enough to cost this character the ""good"" label.In short, Sissy goes from the abusive Bud to the abusive ""real cowboy"", then back to the abusive Bud. It is rather bizarre that Bud gets angry and outraged over somebody ELSE hitting Sissy, although he does not seem to have a problem doing it himself! What an awful example to put out there for young girls to see.Despite the star power and the short-lived mechanical bull craze, this is a movie about unprincipled men and a girl with too little self-esteem to seek relationships elsewhere. Young and impressionable girls: beware."
3,"Okay story, but not for 2 hours and 13 minutes","Farm boy comes to city; boy meets girl; boy marries girl; boy cheats on girl; boy gets girl back. That's essentially the film. Though it does have a fairly memorable soundtrack, you just can't stop watching the timer on the DVD to realize how much longer the movie is going to run. They couldn't have told this story in 92 minutes?"
3,what was cut,I have the copy I taped off of the TV many years ago. Several scenes were not in the DVD that should have bee nand were needed. Doesn't make sense.
3,way to long to get item,i sell dvd's on other web sites......dvd movies are cheaper to ship via 1st class then it does by parcel post or media mail and get to buyers home within 3 -4 days-------------took almost a month to get this.other then that tape was new as descibed
2,What's the big deal?,"This has got to be one of the most overrated movies in history. It's not that I don't like John Travolta either. It's just that I don't buy him as a country guy who goes to bars, line dances, and rides mechanical bulls. Debra Winger is good and so is the supporting cast, but that's not enough in my opinion. There's the music to consider, too. It's so polished and movie-ish that it has no edge whatsoever. It is the exact kind of country music you would expect some Hollywood moron would think was good. I highly recommend you watch this movie before you think about buying it. You might save yourself some money."
5,Urban Cowboy,In my opinion there will NEVER be a movie as good as this one. I have watched it probably a 100+ times. I just love it. It's a classic.
4,DVD Review,"The item was as described, the dvd is in excellent shape, little mis-leading of the cd that was inlcuded it is not the sound track from the movie but just few songs from the 80's. But the dvd is what was most important."
1,"""Suspension of Dis-Belief...""","Any movie, just by its very nature, requires a suspension of dis-belief. ""Star Wars?"" ""Alien?"" ""Howard The Duck?"" C'MON! But to (ahem) cast ""Vinnie Barbarino"" as an (sic) ""urban cowboy?"" Oh well, Madonna & David Hasslehoff have ""played against type"" too, so...your money, ""buy the ticket & take the ride"" and all that..."
1,Not the actual movie soundtrack,"The soundtrack for this movie (which was released in the US as ""Together"") was composed + conducted by Burt Bacharach. The songs (yes, there is singing on the soundtrack) were written by Burt Bacharach + Paul Anka. The songs are performed by Jackie de Shannon, Libby Titus, and Michael McDonald. So, I'm not quite sure what this import represents."
4,Still Great but a Little Dated,"Like most people, I read this book in high school, which was about 45 years ago. I always remembered it very fondly and decided it would make sense to read it as an adult. The story takes place in the 30s in the Deep South and is told through two children: Scout and Jem Fish. Their father, Atticus, is an extremely brave and noble lawyer who has to defend a Black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Harper Lee was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and this is probably one of the most famous and most loved American classics. I enjoyed it very much but I have to admit that it is now feels a bit dated. The reader still feels plenty of outrage at the way the Blacks were treated and admiration for the many lessons Atticus tries to teach his children. However, for me at least, it lost a just a bit of its emotional charge as history has moved on."
1,This Hard Read is gonna fall,"Hinchey doesn't make it easy to read this book. He reaches too far to make his analysis of Dylan's meanings and thought processes make sense. In so doing, he often makes less sense.I feel like Hinchey is a Master Thief who has just robbed me of $20."
2,"Love Blue Chamomile, Hate this Stuff","I decided to try this shampoo out after loving Aubrey Organics Blue Chamomile. I have fine, wavy hair that's prone to oiliness quickly. I figured since this shampoo was marketed towards oily hair, why not give it a try.I really don't like this Egyptian Henna Shampoo at all!It leaves a weird residue in my hair that's difficult to wash out, no matter how much I rinse or how little I use. I never seem to be able to completely remove it and ends up making my hair oily looking. I decided to switch back to blue chamomile line."
4,"Not good for my hair type, but would be great for some others","I got the white camellia, and it didn't work well for my hair type. I have wavy Caucasian hair. This could be good for some people who have drier, frizzier, or more difficult hair though. It made mine greasy."
3,"Aubrey Organics - Honeysuckle Rose Shampoo, 11 fl oz liquid","I like the scent, and for an organic shampoo it does lather/sud pretty well, However, the lather doesn't slide around your scalp at all since there is no silicone, so you end up having to use more of the product to get the shampoo evenly distributed. I also found that I can't run my fingers through my hair at all once I've washed it because it leaves your hair squeaky clean and not slick at all. It took me a little while to get used to that, and I think I lost extra hair finding out."
5,Best Shampoo for Oily Hair,"I've been looking a long time for a shampoo that can deal with my hair. Non-organic shampoos left my scalp extremely oily, but my biggest problem were these annoying pimple-like sores on my head. I had them for YEARS, and though I switched shampoos often, I could never get rid of them. As soon as I tried organic remedies, however, the gross, annoying sores disappeared. I used baking soda for a while, but needless to say that got old pretty fast. I finally decided to pay a bit more than I was used to for real organic shampoo and it was soooo worth it. Aubrey's is awesome. It's not your typical shampoo and it's not supposed to be! I know from my scalp issue that ORGANIC MATTERS. Once you get used to organic shampoos you will never go back. If your hair is super oily, the green tea shampoo is a great choice. It clarifies without harshness and I can go more than 24 hours without washing my hair, FINALLY!"
5,Great shampoo!,"The first Aubrey Organics shampoo I tried was the GPB, and I didn't really like it. This is GREAT, though. Smells good, cleans well, and leaves my straight, fine hair with body. Unlike the GPB, I don't have to use a ton and it spreads easily through my hair. Recommend!"
3,Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose shampoo Review,"The Honeysuckle rose shampoo is ok. It achieves its goal which is to get the hair clean. When I use this shampoo, I shampoo like I regularly do and then rinse. After rinsing, my hair is more dry than it usually is when I shampoo and that is the one main thing that I don't like about this shampoo. This shampoo like its name implies, has a smell of roses. I am not very fond of roses so the smell for me is not very nice, but if you do like the smell of roses you will love the scent of this shampoo. The shampoo is sulfate and paraben free and has many other good ingredients listed.Overall, this shampoo is ok; it does what it is meant to do which is to get the hair clean. It is affordable and has natural/organic ingredients.For more reviews on natural hair products check out:[...]"
3,works ok,I bought this to use on my hair as I am switching my body/skin care products to organic. I like the smell....but I have long hair and had to use a lot of it to wash my hair. It's a bit pricey for the small bottle so I think I'll try out some others before I make a solid decision on whats for me.
3,Cleans nicely,"This shampoo cleans nicely however it is very thin and I need to use a lot to get any sort of lather. Also it smells very strong of earth and herbs, and the scent stays with you."
2,Should be marketed as conditioner,"If this shampoo was sold as ""lightweight conditioner"" instead of shampoo, then I may have given it five stars. However, this did not work for me at all as a shampoo ... and I normally love Aubrey products. In short, over the course of two weeks of using this product, my hair became increasingly oily, clumpy, and dirty looking ... ick. Maybe it's my own fault for not initially checking the ingredients: At least five of the 14 ingredients are oils. No kidding, oils. I agree with the other reviewer that reported that this makes hair feel crunchy, while in contrast, Aubrey's conditioner is awesome. For now I have returned to using my good-old shampoo (with sulfates) and will use up this Aubrey shampoo by applying to only the ends of my hair, like a follow-up conditioning rinse."
2,Not so much,"I am a Caucasian female with somewhat dry, unruly hair. I normally use Biocleanse shampoo and conditioner but became troubled by some of the ingredients in the Biocleanse product. I opted for the Aubrey Organics on a whim and was fairly disappointed. The shampoo does NOTHING for dry hair, and basically makes my hair go flat. Don't buy this product if you have dry hair or use thermal appliances like a hair straightener."
4,worked great,"I used this along with the honey suckle conditioner and together they make a great team, the shampoo didn't leave my hair with the usual slickness from typical shampoos which I loved but it wasn't overly dry either. don't expect a huge later like traditional shampoo that pulls all the natural oil out but a nice gentle lather with a great cleanse, I highly recommend this line for anyone with long, dry and easy to tangle hair"
4,Good product for natural dry hair,"A little background on me. I'm a Bahamian-Haitian from Miami with 3C-type hair and had my big chop to natural hair in June. My hair tends to be very dry, but not nearly as dry as when I had relaxed hair. Although I have found this shampoo in the middle-range of effectiveness of moisturizing shampoos, it does not really lather (no surprise), has a gelatin texture and I have to use a little more of it than traditional shampoos. But then again I have very thick hair. Other people have commented on the smell, but I like it. Your hair mostly holds the smell of the conditioner anyway. I'm new to Aubrey Organics and after using some of their other products, I get the feeling their products work best when you use them together especially the shampoos and conditioners."
5,White Camellia vs Honeysuckle Rose,"I have dry skin, dry scalp, and two kinds of dark blonde hair: a top layer that is very dry, porous, and frizzy with a slight wave and about 30% wiry grays; and a bottom layer that is healthy, normal, and thick with gentle curls. I tried the Honeysuckle Rose shampoo and though I love the fresh scent, and the normal hair likes it just fine, the frizzy dry layer is left too dry, poofy and wild. The White Camellia shampoo is more moisturizing than HSR. It doesn't strip the dry hair, leaves it soft, and I hardly have to use products afterwards.That said, even MY hair looks greasy after using the White Camellia conditioner if I don't restrict it to using just a little to the top layer. The Honeysuckle Rose conditioner is lighter.I've yet to use a clear shampoo that doesn't leave my hair too dry; only creamy ones give me enough moisture. HSR is clear, White Camellia is creamy."
2,dryingg,iv been using it for a few weeks and it hasnt done my hair any favors. if anything its made my hair dryer and harder to deall with. the chemical shampoos were more moisturizing than this.I have curly hair with some frizz.
4,Awesome when used in combination with conditioner,"Works great if used with the conditioner from same company .if you wish to switch to an honeysuckle organic shampoo,this is a good option.Be cautious to use it with the honeysuckle conditioner.If used alone,it leaves hair messy(dont have the exact word for that...too dry may be)."
3,Does what it's suppose to do.,"I've been using this product for a month. I think that it is getting chlorine out of my hair and it's made my hair soft, but the shampoo is real thin and I'm not sure it's worth the price. I've also used Suave's Clarifying shampoo and it works just as well and is about $10 cheaper."
5,Great product,"This is a great shampoo. I have tried other ""free"" shampoos that dry out your hair or leave a nasty build-up. If you are looking for a product that is truly free of toxins and really works well then you should try this."
5,Aromatherapy and Clean Soft Hair in One Bottle,"If you enjoy the scent of roses, you will love this stuff. I always come out of the shower feeling better, but Rosa Mosqueta Shampoo is especially uplifting."
1,watery,"I would never buy this again and don't recommend it. The consistency is like water which makes it hard to direct where on your hair you want to place the shampoo. It runs off your hand as soon as you raise it above your head, just like water would. The smell also reminds me of an elderly woman. Can't wait til its gone and we can switch to something else."
3,Disapointed.....,"I was very dissapointed with the way that this product reacted with my hair. I have very thick, very coarse hair and I was excited because I read the reviews on this product and they were so good. I got ready to use it the first time and it came out of the bottle like water, ran throug my fingers, etc. Then I put what was left on my hair and it wouldn't suds up at all. I shampooed twice as I normally would and the second time I always get lots of suds with other products, I didn't get anymore than I had before. My hair felt clean, but no cleaner and healthier than with my regular Aussie products."
2,Decent natural hair shampoo,"I've used this natural shampoo off and on for about two years now and I like it. It seems to do the trick of getting my oily hair fairly clean.However it works best only when you use it with the green tea rinse. Otherwise, it feels like your hair is not completely clean. The green tea shampoo is very thick, and I guess some of it clings on to the hair shafts and refuses to come off until you use the green tea rinse or a good regular shampoo.The only major problem is that the green tea rinse is the consistency of water and you need a fair bit of the rinse to completely rinse out your hair. As you can see, this leads to the rinse running out very quickly (think monthly) and the stuff is not cheap either. So, as a result, I don't use this shampoo very much due to the high costs of use."
1,"No lather, doesn't work","This stuff doesn't lather well at all and my scalp did not feel clean. To be fair, I've found that with other organic shampoos too. Their conditioner is very very good but skip the shampoo. The scent is nice."
2,very surprised,"I rely on Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner, so I was shocked with this shampoo.1) It smells NOTHING like the conditioner. I expected differences, but this was just ridiculous. The best way I can describe it is as smelling like my cat's flea bath. Horrible.2) After the first lather my hair felt stripped of any moisture.I can't stress enough how much I adore the Aubrey conditioner of this scent, and other shampoos by them, but this one was a huge miss for me."
4,Decent Shampoo,"I bought this shampoo to try to help with oiliness on my scalp and frizzy texture at the ends. I must say that it has helped with the oiliness, but the frizzy problem was only slightly helped.Overall the shampoo is decent when used with the matching conditioner, but it was not the miracle I was expecting (some reviews would lead you to believe it was liquid gold). Also, the shampoo will lather. I may not buy this again, but I plan on exploring more of Aubrey organics extensive shampoo formulas.So here's a quick breakdownPROS: Cleans hair well; helped with oily issue on my scalp; somewhat cured my frizzy ends; after about a month of use my hair is much more healthy than it used to be; no chemicalsCONS: Kind of expensive; texture is runny, but not unbearable in my opinion; the scent is not that great, but I can live with it; I have to use quite a bit to work through my medium/long hair;"
5,Aubrey Shampoo,"I bought the Aubrey Organics Island Natural Shampoo. I like the scent. It smells like AllSpice, which is one of the ingredients listed. It lathered much better than expected. I had always heard that natural products did not lather as well, but this was not the case. I like that it does not contain Lauryl Sulfate and many of the other ingredients that are bad for our health and enviornment. I do not like the idea that by using a shampoo, I am killing fish and other wildlife. It cleaned my hair well, and I am considering purchasing the Conditioner, as my hair tends to be dry at times."
3,"Great indgredients, overpriced, dries hair","If I were to create a shampoo, this has all of the ingredients I would use. However, it left my hair feeling like straw and I had to use a lot of conditioner afterward. If you are looking for a healthy shampoo, you should try it. There are not many shampoos made with such high quality ingredients as this one is."
4,Honeysuckl Rose,"Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great. My hair didn't improve dramatically but I have verrrrrrry curly, thick hair. I still use it because it works as well as everything else I have tried but smells GREAT!"
2,"OK product, takes time to get used to","This is not a ""normal"" shampoo, at least in my opinion. It has an oil-like consistency, in a clear, green-tea color. It's hard to hold it in the palms and work up the lather. And this shampoo just doesn't lather well. I really have to add water little by little (even though the hair is already wet) and really take the time to work up the lather. And in the process I've got my hair all tangled with the constant rubbing-motion. Not the best thing to do for long thick hair. However, after rinsing, the hair does become noticeably softer. I still need to apply de-tangling product before I can comb through the hair, but the hair seems moisturized, so I guess the product does its job. No fragrance- just a natural, tree-oil-like smell. I've used it about 5 times so far. Will finish the bottle but probably not buy it again or recommend it to anyone with long hair."
3,"Strong smelling, great quality","I generally love most Aubrey Organics but this shampoo did not work for me. I have fine hair and it was just too heavy and made my hair dry. I wasn't crazy about the scent. It's not bad, just very strong and stays with you. I've used the Blue Camomile and really liked that."
2,Just not for me,"I really wanted to like this line because it is all natural but this line is not for me. I have tried several of aubrey products and it doesn't work well with my hair and neither one of my daughters. We are african americans and maybe this product is not for us. It doesn't moisturize as well as I thought. I am not saying that this product is not for everyone it is just not for me and my family. I won't be trying anything else from Aubrey Organics. I have tried GPB, Poo and Condish, Honeysuckle Rose Poo and Condish, and now the Island Naturals Poo and Condish. None of which works well. I also tried the Blue Green Algae Mask and the Primrose Tangle-Go Hair Conditioner and Detangler, and the White Camellia and Jasmine Shine Conditioner Spray."
2,Left me disappointed,"Usually my hair seems to love organic shampoos, but not with this one. My hair was the exact type that the shampoo was made for, and after the first usage my hair felt greasy, stringy, had a ton of fly aways and looked as if I hadn't washed it in several weeks. I gave it two more tries, both to disappointment, before I gave up on it.Warning to anyone with fine and straight, dull hair - choose a different organic product. The one I was using before Aubrey Organics was Kiss My Face's Big Body Shampoo, which was incredible. It also lasts longer, is easier to find in stores, and is cheaper."
3,Not sure about this...,I have been using this shampoo for several months now and I will probably look for another when it runs out. I have found adding water into the bottle makes the shampoo easier to use. It was hard to work into my hair. The fact that it has to be shaken very time I use it means I can't put it in the dispenser on the wall. My hair does seem healthier and it's chemical free (I'm using the conditioner too). I do like the conditioner better than the shampoo. This is my first natural hair cleaner so it's competing with chemical shampoos I have grown up using. I would come back if I did not find another natural shampoo that worked better.
2,itchy - didn't like it,"IMHO the more I used it, the worse my hair got. My sculp itched, my hair was hay-dry on the first day and lumpy and dull on the second. I didn't like the smell either. It's very retro - that's the only way I can describe it. Not at all sentual. Now it's my dog's shampoo. He doesn't mind. In fact, I think he likes it."
2,Not the best chlorine removal shampoo,"I bought this to use on two of my kids hair that are competitive swimmers. It doesn't seem get any chlorine out and my children's hair is still rough, apt to tangle and brittle afterwards. I'd recommend the ULTRA SWIM DYNAMIC DUO REPAIR Shampoo as it works much better overall."
3,Survival,"Nazi occupied Paris. A French doctor living there with his teen age children, his unloved wife in the south of France on her vineyard. The mistress, his erstwhile secretary. As the Allies move closer to liberating the city, important decisions have to be taken, and now the cast of characters, both German and French, start to scramble to act in their own rather selfish interests. In the process, the latent cruelty that lurks within us all emerges with a vengeance.The Mistress is not so much a story of war as of the drive to survive, made sharper by forced deprivation. There is no romance here, no love, no sacrifice, no heroics. It compels the reader to consider whether these people and their actions are deviant or typical, to wonder how the self would react under similar pressures."
2,Reads like a hokey Nazi flick,"Unfortunately, Philippe Tapon seems to have gorged himself on far too many Nazi movies (and perhaps a few set in Paris) before sitting down to write this unsatisfying tale of l'amour, French style. This novel reads as though it were written in a single sitting, without revision, as French menus and plot twists flew into the author's mind. Except for one ghastly and characteristically Gallic murder, the book is strangely flat. The characters of stomach doctor Emile Bastien and the Gestapo officer he treats have some depth; everyone else serves as a backdrop. If you want to read an authentic novel set in France during the Nazi occupation, read anything by Kay Boyle. She was there. J. Robert Janes' current detective series set in Paris under the Vichy government is also far superior to this overrated book."
5,WUNDERBAR,"How odd the last reviewer's comments are! The characters in this short novel are well-rounded, totally believable, totally French . . . The story is gripping, original, diabolical, and moves swiftly forward. It's so realistic in a gritty hallucinatory way--that the only soft spot in the story for me was Simone's dream sequence (pages 140-45), which I thought was distracting. ""Hokey Nazi flic,"" reader from Rhode Island? Couldn't disagree more! The novel reads like an art film in your head. I don't think it would translate as well on the silver screen."
4,Excellent resource for those teaching behavior labs,"This is a fantastic and much-needed book. As a resource for someone setting up a laboratory course in animal behavior, this book is full of excellent ideas, and I would advise anyone to get a copy of this book. The problem with adopting it as a lab book for students is that there are over 30 labs presented here. As many are multiweek projects, the most that could reasonably be done in a semester is 7-10 labs. Anyone who has taught students knows that having them purchase a book ... for which they will only use 1/4 or 1/3 of the chapters is only inviting a tremendous amount of griping. This is my only complaint with this book, which the publisher was pushing as a lab manual for students, instead of a resource for instructors."
5,"An assemblage of studious, college-level essays","Collaboratively assembled and edited by Bonnie J. Ploger (Hamline University) and Ken Yasukawa (Beloit College), Exploring Animal Behavior In Laboratory And Field is a scholarly compendium offering a variety of diverse approaches to the development, function, and evolution of animal behavior, with contribution each being grounded in the creation and careful testing of scientific hypotheses. An assemblage of studious, college-level essays on select topics ranging from the response of tree squirrels to different types of alarm calls, to human nonverbal communications, to chemoreception in lizards, and a great deal more, Exploring Animal Behavior In Laboratory And Field would make an especially welcome addition to Zoological Studies reference collections and Wildlife Studies reading lists."
2,"fine item, wrong part.","I purchased a dehumidifier and while shopping the tubing came up as relevant to the dehumidifier. This product does not fit a Frigidaire FAD704DUD 70 Pt. Dehumidifier. Tube looks to be fine, but not worth returning."
1,Some contents settle,"I have used this product for over 50 years and liked it. When I bought it on line it came with a stick-on label on the top that said ""some settling may acore"". When I opened it, to my surprise, the can was only half full if that."
4,Very worthwhile,"Seeing it from Porter's point of view as an Aide was interesting. Although Porter was an unabashed fan of Grants, it was a very insiteful and interesting read."
3,"Not as good as ""Left of the Middle""","Of course ""Left of the Middle"" was a hard act to follow, with songs like ""One More Addiction"" and ""Leave Me Alone."" Not to mention ""Torn,"" which is a little lightweight and was played to death on the video stations, but it was still a great song. There's nothing close to that on this CD. If you like Natalie you'll appreciate having more of her music. But if you're like me, none of these songs will be playing in your head the way the ones on ""Left of the Middle"" still are. She has a couple of other CDs out, and I will be a dutiful fan and buy them. Hopefully they're better."
4,Natalie Imbruglia Lovers,"Pretty much basic Natalie Imbrulia song material - similar to earlier releases. Nothing ground breaking here. Natalie Imbruglia lovers will, again, love it."
5,My Second Favorite Album of the Year!,"Natalie proves that her previous successes have definitely not been flukes with this richly textured album. Her voice has never been stronger and her songwriting skills continue to mature and develop. I find it infuriating that this CD has not found the distribution that it deserves in the States as many of the singles (namely ""Perfectly"") have the potential of being huge pop successes with the proper promotion. It's a shame that a second hit has eluded her as her catalog of songs is teaming with accessability (much like ""Beauty on the Fire"" from White Lillies Island).If you are able to locate a copy of this very accomplished album, you should do yourself a favor and pick it up."
5,"Slow down, get this beautifull cd","I love this woman, Natalie Imbruglia is nice, is gorgeous, sings incredible, this her third offer counting down the days contains the most pretty , emotional and inspiring collection of songs you can enjoy , please check ""slow down"" , ""shiver"", ""counting down the days"" you gonna fall in loveHM"
1,A sleeper hit,"The same countless rambles of a depressed woman trying to get it together. Better to put on to sleep or cleaning the house. Not, as great as the last album."
4,Pretty good album from Natalie Imbruglia...,"I think this is the weakest of her three albums. I was not as impressed and felt she plays it more ""safe"" on this album. I would recommend her first album way before this one!"
4,Putting it together,"This book puts together how to programming eVB with the backend of sending and recieving data through a variety of ways that most programmers already work with or should begin to work with. XML, SQL CE, RDA, POOM, and more are covered. You see the big picture of CE devices and their possible roles at an enterprise level."
1,Stinks Something Terrible,My wife tried an old gold capped bottle for Christmas. It's the first time I've smelled a fragrance that stinks. She's worn Enjoli for the 20 years I've known her so I know what it should smell like. Caveat Emptor. Awaiting the sellers response for a return.
5,Love this perfume,"I was going to purchase a somewhat cheaper one for exactly the same thing, but the shipping was more so I saved money by paying more for the product with the shipping being less. I love this perfume. It came in fast and I am very pleased."
1,enjoli spray way over the top charging,i used to by enjoli for only 18 to 20 bucks you guys suck at how much you charge not worth buying from you at all
1,Not the real Enjoli - Ripped Off,"I purchased a few bottles when I found that Enjoli was being discontinued and now that I have opened one, it is obvious that it is a knock-off and not an original. The box and the bottles with covers look authentic, but the sprayers are cheaper and the scent is different, harsh, and cheap smelling. I have worn this perfume for over 25 years and when I first tried this bottle it gave me a headache. I then opened the other bottles to find the same cheap sprayer and the same awful scent......too late to do anything about it! Ripped Off! Don't buy!"
1,Order....CANCELLED,"I ordered this item when it was $28+ a bottle. Ordered two for a friend. Later that afternoon, the price shot up to $70+ a bottle.My order didn't ship.And then it didn't ship.And then it didn't ship again.Amazon still shows my order getting ready to be shipped, but NetRush cancelled via email this afternoon.Their excuse? ""Out of stock.""Hmmmmmmmmm........Very disappointed that it took them 9 days to discover that the item was ""out of stock.""Or is it?Would be nice if they informed Amazon so I could get this ""purchase"" (ha!)off my history."
2,intellectual exercise (yawn),"Kudos to this group for recording these works. However I can't remember a duller performance of Spem in alium. I have performed the work three times and own several recordings of it. Whether or not you buy this CD depends on your reason for wanting it. If you want to own one recording of Spem in alium, this is not the CD you want. Get the Tallis Scholars' recording instead. If you love polyphony and are looking for a good listening experience, depending on your taste, this one might do, especially if you are looking for something relaxing (i.e., something to put you to sleep). If you are a musicologist with an intellectual interest in multichoral polyphony, and just want to hear the works, and want a performance that is correct, and don't need it to be exciting, this recording is worth the purchase."
4,dvd's,I love the videos once i recived them over a month later. I am not sure if i will ever order from this site again....
3,Needs more detailed introductions to concepts,"I have used the statics and dynamics book from Hibbeler, as well, and all books seem to be lacking in more in-depth analysis of the concepts we are supposed to learn."
5,LR Review,"Excellent book. As a textbook it very easy to follow. As a reference for the professional work, give all the tools and examples required for a day by day Mechanical Engineering work. I already have 3 books from Dr Hibbeler. He is an outstanding engineer and professor."
2,"Okay, but poor discussion","I used this book for an engineering mechanics course. I still have it. I decided to keep it instead of sell it. The book is very well illustrated and full of problems with the answers in the back of the book. The discussions are brief and poorly developed. They do not facilitate an intuitive understanding of the subject material. The author seems to believe you will develop theoretical understanding by working problems. Alas, the approach will probably result in a good grade but not in a solid understanding. If you are an atypical sudent genuinely searching for subject mastery, this book is of marginal value. Its value is largley in the illustrations alone. I have found that having multiple books on the same subject is often the best learning approach. Since one author may cover one subject well and fall short where another shines."
2,Not Great,"This book is not very helpful for the course I am taking. It doesn't do a great job of explaining subjects, although some of the examples are informative. I could definitely get through the course without this book, however."
4,Overall good book,Good book detailing major aspects of Engineering Systems. I used this in an Undergrad class. Book had decent examples and problems used to touch most problem types.
2,mecmovies only sometimes help,"The book itself is nothelful, the movies are great but they aren't always on point, or rather some situations don't have a mec movie."
3,"Dear Mum, in Ohio For A Year","A child named Cassandra is left by her widowed mother to be taken care of by her Aunt and uncle, Emily and Fred.Cassandra barely even knows Aunty Emily and Uncle Fred and is very depressed over her new situation.It's a fairly simple novel aimed at junior readers and I wouldn't have read it if I'd realized the character was so little!..eleven.But it wasn't too difficult for me to slowly be drawn into Cassies' story.Especially as she was such an imaginative, quirky and funny character.It is with help from her creative wwriting class that she is finally able to put pen to paper and write to her mother.This is to delightfully funny results.Cassie has indeed learned to be creative.She stretches the truth, up until the final chapter when she is able to become honest about her feelings.Linda RowePS.. The story Cassie writes about a rhino is adorable and ..this word again...funny.PPS....The hubcap fell off the bus this morning."
1,Matter and memory,This book is not an edited text and I would not recommend it to anyone! The formatting is all off and it's practically impossible to read.
1,not proofread by a person,"Whatever you think of Bergson, you shouldn't read this edition of Matter and Memory.As the publisher notes in the book (though I don't recall seeing it on Amazon's page), this is a scanned reproduction-- all typing, proofreading, and design were automated. The text is filled with typos, footnotes appear to be run into the body of the text, and it is barely readable."
1,Shipping?,$8.80 for shipping? That is absolutely ridiculous. It doesn't even weigh anything. You can go to Sally Beauty Supply store and get these for $4.
2,stainless steel?,"Fast shipping, $10.50 total, not bad. They look solid and shiny and just a hair smaller then what I have now. To me is to shiny, shiny enough to pass as stainless steel and not titanium. There is nothing on these earrings/studs that can convince me that they are titanium. I am keeping them since I can't find them at any store. I would be happier if at least I had a ""T"" for titanium. If there was a mistake with the shipping (which it happens, per my past experiences, no complains, just that it happens) , I hope the seller notifies me if they review these comments."
1,Obscene Shipping Charges!,I was hoping 3 years later the company would get with it. In 2010 it's still $8.80 to ship something that weighs a fraction of an ounce! I cancelled the order immediately!
2,Not the item pictured,"These are not the adjustable length cords in the picture. There are two 14"", two 19"", and one 26"" cords, and they seems very sturdy, but they aren't what I was expecting from the image--I wanted something adjustable."
1,locked up in less than a hour,"The fan worked great at first, but within a hour of usage it started making a noise and completely locked up. Very embarrassing on my custom 69 Camaro. On a high note Amazon.com's return service is fantastic. Just hope the replacement last a little longer than a hour."
3,Didn't like cardboard box,"It would have been nice to know that the DVD was contained in a cardboard rather than the usual plastic box. It's more pliable this way, and thus not as sturdy and durable."
