3,A bit outdated,"The problem is not, but the book is a outdated about the internet access fee. The terrible story about people spending $800 a month for internet access and get into financial trouble, no longer exist today since we are no longer charged by minutes (which makes it easier to get addicted).Besides, I don't think controlling the online minutes is a good solution for chatroom / message board addiction. Just like quitting cigarattes or recovering from alcoholism, the only way is to cut off completely.Now the good things: The existence of this book alone would help. The first step to recover is the simple acknowledge that Internet addiction is a real problem and how destructive it would be. The examples used in the book make you realize you are not alone in this problem."
2,This book was so-so,"This was a pretty good book overall. It gave insight into the world of internet addiction in general. I was hoping there would be more information on internet ""sexual"" addiction, such as cybersex and pornography. I think it could have had a better recovery plan, i.e. twelve step system for ""Netaholics"", etc."
3,Prescient,"This book was written almost 10 years ago, back in the days of list servers and chat room mania. Even so, it really captures the allure and addictiveness of the electronic medium. I bought it because my 19 year old son is addicted to video games. Though it isn't (yet) an ""official"" psychiatric diagnosis -- probably due to lobbying by the video game industry to the psychiatric industry (maybe even payoffs) -- it is a REAL thing. If gambling can be an addiction and sex can be an addition, video gaming can definitely be an addition. I probably shouldn't have written this review because I haven't finished the book yet, but Amazon sent me this email asking me to ... so far it is very factual and resonates completely with my son's situation. I haven't gotten to any ""solutions"" yet ... I am hopeful."
2,Outdated Information,"I should have paid more attention to the publication date before I purchased this book. The information in it concerning the internet is antique at this point. Days of CompuServe, AOL and hourly charges for time spent online are long gone. It's hard getting past the outdated information to find the book of any help. It's a good enough read but check it out of the library and save your money."
1,Buy anything other than this book.,"I made the subject the topic of my final year Uni. project.Without labouring the point, buy anything that isn't by K. Young.OK alternatives are Griffiths or Grohol.Good to see you looking at the subject - just don't buy a Young book."
5,Nice scale,"Is as described in Amazon listing. Excellent packaging, easy to assemble.Works great, consistent readings. One minor negative - the fold outhorizontal bar for measuring height is plastic and is rather loose andflexible for precise readings. But hey, I do like this scale and woulddefinitely order it again."
3,"Nice scale, but confusing instructions",This is a nice scale. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because the instructions and diagrams for assembly were not good at all. There were also pieces scattered in the box instead of packaged separately. Putting it together was just a headache.
4,Scales,I am the fitness manager for a large resort. People seem to like a bigger scale similar to the old time doctor's office. These scales are extremely acccurate and perfect for our locker rooms.
5,The litte weight machine that can!,It might not be so little but this weight machine is the best on the market and more accurate than any I have found. You can even weigh small packages for the post office or however you will be shipping if it weighs more that 1/4 pound. The post office tells me I an right on when it is weighed there. Great product and built so well that I won't have to buy another hopefully.
5,fantastic scale and superior customer service,"We love this scale! Also, it arrived 2 days earlier than scheduled. Would definitely buy from this seller again."
4,Health O Meter,The scale works very well but it was broken when I received it. The heightmeasuring device was broken when I unpacked the scale. This is thesecond item I have received from Amazon.com that didn't work properly uponreceipt. The other item was a VCR/DVD recorder-player. I sent the VCR/DVDrecorder back and promptly received another one which didn't work properlyeither.
1,Din not work at all.,Unit is heavy to handle. Put together carefully in any case. Did not work at all. Returned.
5,weigh- in as promised,"Easy to assemble, accurate. a bit heavy such that a second helping hand makes set up fairly straight forward.Recommended."
5,Nice scale,"After buying several stand on mechanical and electronic scales, I will never buy another. This balance beam scale has a small footprint similar to other scales, but is very easy to use. Since you can balance it at zero and use the sliding weights, it is easy enough to know if it is out of adjustment. My other scales would always give a different reading every step on, but this is very consistent and you don't have to worry about the accuracy."
1,too small,The beam is very small and hard to read. don't know what you want here are the additional works still need a word
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this scale and when it came it had parts broken and could not be used. I returned it and tried a second one. This one came with only two straps holding the box closed. The box had previously been opened. When we put it together and tried to adjust the screw to balance it to zero, it would not worked. We could not get the balance beam to work at all. Since this was the second one we tried, we asked for a refund. Amazon was very prompt in giving us the refund, so I will definitely buy from them again, just not another scale."
1,I wish I actually weighed 50 lbs less!!,"With all the excellent reviews, I guess I was expecting more... first, the quality wasn't there. The overall appearance was rather ""flimsy"". After assembly (the instructions are NOT the greatest), the scale was balanced to zero but would weigh everybody over 50 lbs less than they actually were. After calling the manufacturer and trying all the tips they could suggest, there was just no way to fix this problem. I guess I just received a lemon but I wouldn't have purchased it to begin with if I saw it ""in person"" before ordering. I'm heading to a medical supply store next to see EXACTLY what I'm buying next time."
4,good scale but balance problem,"Good acurate scale for MD office but base mooving both ways giving impression of lack of stability, I did not have time to inspect it yet"
1,A major waste of my time,"After receiving my first order, (Health O Meter Physician Balance Beam Scale)I found it to be defective. I promptly returned it and it was replaced with another with exactly the same problem. Bad first impression."
1,Fleeced,"HealthOMeter 402KL (Health O Meter) Physician Balance Beam Scale I ordered a ""Health o Meter"" Physician Balance Beam scale and paid for it by Visa Card. When the scale arrived three weeks later it was not the model that I ordered. Health o Meter was helpful and said that they would send the correct model once IRoams sent them the O.K., but Iroams was rude and told me to ""prove"" I had ordered another model and said that he (IRoams) was ""just a man trying to make a living"" and refused to do anything unless I paid the freight both ways, which would have cost as much as the scale itself. Consequently I am stuck with the wrong model. Don't deal with IRoams if you want a Health o Meter scale, buy from someone else.Dr. R. Bennett, Pahoa, Hawaii"
1,2 Bad Shipments in a row,"Very dis-appointed. I can't tell you whether the product even works because the first scale that came in had a manufacturer defect in that the balance beam was off center rendering the whole unit worthless. The second order came in just yesterday and the entire balance beam unit was completely sheered off of the base. After closer examination I realized that it was all due to cheap manufacturing, improper packing, and yes probably the way UPS handles the items during shipping. In this case 2 strikes and you are out. I am asking for a full refund, also realizing that it is not really Amazon's fault, but it should be known that they should really not deal with that particular Manufacturer any more. This caused some major inconvenience to a pretty good way of shopping. Other Items I have purchased from Amazon were fine! I hope Amazon takes heed to this message!"
4,Health O Meter,"This is an excellent product. The packaging was very good.It came in two pieces. The assembly was minimum, butslightly cumbersome because of the weight. The scale isaccurate and it looks like it is made to last. The reason Igave it only 4 stars is that the height measurement rod felt toocheap and breakable. Lastly, it should be understood that thisscale is not for everybody. It is either for a doctor's office orfor a large bath or exercise room. I was not able to find anything ofcomparable value for less price."
3,Customer Service by seller Center Aisle LLC very poor,"The Health o Meter itself was low quality for the money. The assembly instructions indicate that the contents include 2 counterweights for heavier weight items but they were not received. The packaging styrofoam actually had holes where the weights would have been placed, but according to Center Aisle LLC the company decided a few months ago not to include them any longer. They did not have any care or concern that the packaging stated the counterweights were included nor did they seem to care whether or not I returned the item. Won't purchase anything from them again."
4,"Decent for the price, cheap numbering system","I just received this scale and it assembles very quickly and easily (5 minutes). The balance was right on without my having to mess with it. The beam does have more movement up and down than some of the better scales I have been on. My bigest negative for this unit is the numbering. Instead of numbers etched into the metal of the beam, the numbers are on a sticker that is placed on the beam and mine has some creases and a couple of air bubbles under the sticker. I could easily see this sticker coming loose in a couple of years and needing to be replaced. I took off one star for this cheap numbering system and almost took off two stars. I think the manufacturer should have spent a few extra dollars and had the numbers stamped into the beam rather than relying on cheap stickers. Otherwise, it seems like this is a decent quality scale for the price."
4,balance beam scale,My purchase arrived in a matter of days and was in excellent shape. I had a minor problem with assembly but a quick call to the company rectified the problem. It is an item I have wanted for many years and I couldn't be happier with it.
5,The SAME SCALE as in the Doctor's office!!!,"This scale is PERFECT for me...ACCURATE ACCURATE ACCURATE - which is what I was looking for. My scale that I HAD before varied in weight - depending on where I shoved it with my foot after I weighed myself and DIDn't like the result...I would nudge it a few inches and the number was at least two or three pounds changed!! THIS scale is just like in my doctor's office, and a DREAM!! PLUS, I am in Amazon.com PRIME - and my shipping was FREE!"
2,Health o Meter Balance Scale,"This product was difficult for one person to assemble. Assembly required balancing heavy, unstable components in an awkward configuration in order to tighten screws underneath. Once assembled, the bar with weights did not suspend freely; it seems to be not centered front-to-back. It is difficult to get an accurate weight. The parts feel cheaply made."
5,High Quality - Great Scale!,"This is about as close as you can get to the scales in your doctor's office! Construction is excellent! This scale should last a lifetime and your children can use it after your gone <smile>. Assembly isn't difficult. Attach the pillar to the base with 4 nuts, using the provided wrench and hook a steel rod to the base mechanism. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes start to finish. The scale works beautifully and gives VERY consistent readings! Reads up to 350 pounds without any calulations. Up to 500 by adding an additional weight and then adding 150 to the actual scale reading! I am really delighted with the scale. It's everything I had hoped it would be and the price is quite low for the quality you get!"
3,Extra Loose Pieces - No Help from Manufacturer,"The product itself appears to be of good quality. Unfortunately, it arrived with some loose pieces, mostly from the height measuring apparatus. A call to the manufacturer to find out how to put the loose pieces back in their correct places offered no help. They could only send us the non-detailed diagrams that came in the box for assembling the scale. The instructions and diagrams tell you exactly what you need to know, if everything arrives intact. We spent a couple of hours trying to put the pieces in place and ended up securing one piece with a paper clip."
5,very nice,This is a very well made and packed for shipment scale. It was easy to assemble with only 4 nuts and one spring loop. It is made out of heavy material and this height measure is all steel. It is 100% repeatable. I am very pleased at this purchase and would recommend it
1,Junk this scale,This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased. We received the product and the scale was 3 lbs off. We called the company and told them the problem. the person on the phone basically insinuated that we were the problem. After much haggling they agreed to send us another base. Lo and behold when the new base came the scale still did not work. We tried everything. Being such a large and cumbersome item there is really no practical way to send this back so we are stuck with this product that does not work. it is ridiculous in this day and age where a company cannot get their act together and ship something that is going to work. you would do well to scratch this vendor from your list. I will not use amazon again. at least if I buy a piece of junk from a local store I can bring it back and get a refund. in odering through amazon I have none.
3,Elvis Does Broadway Well,"The music in this show is great. They didn't hire some Elvis impersonator to come and do this show. These are Elvis songs that have been reinvented in a musical theater style, and they sound great. That being said, just from listening to this CD you get very little about the actual plot of the musical. After reading the synopsis you can listen and understand what is going on, but just popping this CD in without glancing at the production notes will lead you to musical theater Elvis songs. I really enjoyed the music on this CD. Some of the voices need a little work, but overall my toe was tapping and my head was bopping. Good for new musical fans, as well as musical collectors. Probably not good for Elvis purists. Favorite song: ""Teddy Bear/Hound Dog"""
2,If you're considering this as a learning tool for the show...,"...Be aware that many of the tracks bear little more than passing resemblance to the arrangements available for rent from Theatrical Rights Worldwide. For example, in the printed arrangement, there is no ""Overture"" that dies out after a minute or so: instead there is a full-on extended version of ""Jailhouse Rock"" that, well, rocks. Conversely, ""Roustabout"" goes on much longer on the CD.This recording doesn't offer accurate tempos, either, as the whole thing is a bit sped up, presumably to fit it all on a single disc. This is not ""reference quality"" in the tradition of Broadway cast recordings from Decca, etc. It's better than nothing, but just barely."
5,If you ride this book is a must!!!,This book explain everything that will help you place first when in the show ring. It is a must for a beggining rider to an advanced grand prix rider.
2,.....check the price!,"I love Smallville; I knew very little about Superman from comics or movies, so I don't have much of a base of comparison, but I love this show! I've seen maybe half of season 5 and none of season 6, but everything up to that point was riveting and clever, in my opinion. Michael Rosenbaum is fabulous as Lex, Kristen Kreuk is hot and vulnerable and sweet as Lana, and Erica Durance brought in some great new ""blood"" and personality as Lois.Why then, do you ask, did I give it only 2 stars? Because this set of the first four seasons is grossly overpriced when compared to buying the seasons individually. At the time of this writing, the first 5 seasons are all available for less than $25 each, and this set is $165!"
4,"Pure, Fun Entertainment","This show is awesome! We don't get the UPN stations where I live so I missed all these shows over the past four years. Not only is the acting so great that you will want to watch and rewatch, but the story-lines intertwine with a lot of present day values like the corporate beast and small town America. I really hate Lionel he gives me the CREEPS! The cast is incredible and even Christopher Reeves makes several guest appearances before his passing in Season 3. I would say buy it if you love the Superman series, comic books, and Krypton lore because it really is a flashback to all that stuff and imagine a town, Smallville, that is home of the meteorite!?! That is something in itself everything in Smallville centers around these rocks and how they have affected the lives of the citizens whether they like it or not."
1,TINY!!!,This is a very small set that would be used as a toy for a child if you are looking for a big tea set this is not for you. Was very disappointed when it came in the mail in a tiny box.
5,Great Book for Photoshop Users!,Ben gets you up to speed on the NEW features in Photoshop CS2. His writing style and examples are easy to follow and you will be using the new features in no time. This book along with his Photoshop for Photographers book are two of the best!
1,"good idea, but doesn't work","I was really excited when I saw this and couldn't wait to get home and try it out. I thought it'd be really helpful now to put toys on for my 5 month old and when he gets older, for finger foods, but the tray doesn't snap on. It falls off immediately, doesn't really fit onto the seat at all, and seems quite useless. I bought it this morning and will be returning it this afternoon. For $2.50 (at Target) I'd try it again, if they redesigned it to somehow snap onto the seat."
4,Insightful interviews with some legends.,"I'm a huge Actors Studio fan. As easy as it is to make fun of Dean Lipton, I think he does a great job of stepping out of the way and letting the actors shine with their answers. Really loved the men on this collection. The Newman interview is one of my favs. Redford and Eastwood also have interesting stories to share of their rise to stardom.I'm gonna give it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of Barbara. Listen, the woman has talent, a great story, etc. But it's hard not to laugh at those nails and some of her mannerisms. But I admire her talent and career.I just PRAY all the Actor Studio episodes are released at some point. For now, this will do."
1,INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO,"Perhaps it's because mi english it's no so good, but I think the audio it's not quite well."
5,Tiesto never ceases to amaze...,"I have heard some incredible mixes by Tiesto before, but nothing can compare to ISOS 3...this album is simply one of the best out there. Keeping in line with the rest of the ISOS series, Tiesto maintains a more relxed attitude than is heard in some of his other mixes, but he makes sure to keep you interested: ISOS 3 keeps you on the edge of your seat. Truly a masterpiece,only Magik 6 can compare."
3,No different than the other one.,"I bought this cd after buying ""In Search of Sunrise Vol 3"" standard, and thought that IMPORT might be better and have a better mix. To my surprise, they sounded just the same, so I kept the regular one and returned this one.I didn't think it was worth paying the extra just for import.Music wise...it's GREAT, all the songs are very good and the mood Tiesto has is incredible. He is currently one of my favorite DJs.Also, this cd, as well as most of the Tiesto cds that I've bought, seem to skip around the last tracks of the album. I do not know what is wrong. At first, I thought it was only 1 cd that was bad, but I exchanged it and bought more and still happens. What a dissapointment! I do not think it's my cd player, because NO OTHER cd does that.It's just weird. That's why I give it 3 stars.But, don't let that dissapoint you. The music is incredibly good."
1,What is SIMPLE?,"In this book he never really puts together what SIMPLE really means . The story about how he became a trader are a little hard to believe. He couldn't recognize that he was being scammed twice,turning his life upside down then all of a sudden he understands the futures market in a few months . He had such a brief trading history and then writes a book about a technique that is not exclusive . Much too pricey for the content!"
2,Disappointing product even though the price was very reasonable,"Disappointed. Wanted to use as a rowing exerciser...resistance was slight, there should be a way of increasing the resistance; also, within several days of receiving...the foam bit near the pedals came off. I wear 7.5 sneakers and they did not fit properly in the stirrups."
2,Boring and Dated,"This Video is Boring. I'm a big Ministryfan, especially of the years '89-'92, butthis video just bored me.The visuals sucked. AND the biggest thingthat bugged me was the fact that when theywould cloe-up on Al Jourgensen's Mouth atthe words weren't matching, as if he was LipSyncing or something. But maybe they justoverdubbed better a better vocal performanceover this video.I give this video 2 stars for WilliamRieflin playin drums and looking coolwith the shirt and tie. Other than that,the video sucks."
2,"Too Short, Too 70's",Video is only 21 minutes long and has background music (and hair styles) that place it being filmed in the late 70's or so. . .
5,Excellent!,"I loved this book. The only thing that could have been better was a little more in the last two chapters it seemed to end very smartly, and loving a good epilogue maybe one of those too! This aside, what a fantastic read!"
5,"funny funny book,",See Jane Score was a fun read. I don't think there was a chapter that didn't make me laugh. I enjoy the diverse romance mixed with humor. I thought mixing the two ingredients worked...at least for me it did!
3,Cute read...,"When I heard from one of my GR friends that the hero of this book says aboot instead of about, and he had a tattoo above his nether regions, I was all over this book like white on rice. I almost gave up a few times since I didn't particularly like the heroine, but when I remembered aboot that tat....I'm glad I stuck with it to the end because it did turn out to be a likable read. I thought the heroine didn't do the hero justice but even with an unworthy heroine he made the book worth the read. This was a Cute story about a plain Jane and a super hot hockey player."
2,This is NOT a good hockey romance!,"After reading ""Body Check"" by Deidre Martin I was psyched to learn there was another book out there with a hockey hero. But ""See Jane Score"" was really disappointing. The plot is stupid and worse, it's obvious that Rachel Gibson doesn't know anything about hockey OR hockey players. Skip it."
5,An Exciting Read!!,"This book was one of those that I had a hard time putting down. First, because the protagonist, Jane Alcott was such an engaging heroine. I liked her spunk and determination. Also, I learned a bit about hockey, which I know nothing! It was interesting to look at sports from a reporter's point of view. Also, the interaction between Jane and Luc were wonderful! It's not often that I lose sleep over a book, but this was one fabulous exception!"
4,Rachel Gibson SCORES........,"This magnificent contemporary romance by Rachel Gibson leaves readers breathless and enthralled with every page turned. Jane and Luc are two wonderful characters whose chemistry is explosive, enjoyable and especially decadent when it comes to a certain horseshoe tattoo! Readers should be prepared for some hard hits to the heart, smooth talking jocks and even some penalties when secrets are revealed in this story. This book was delightful from start to the finish and readers don't have to be hockey fans to enjoy it."
5,What a funny book,I have NEVER laughed so hard when reading romantic. Rachel Gibson is a great writer and I lost myself in this book. She is so descriptive in her settings and so down-to-earth in her dialogue that I actually felt I was there in every scene.I would highly recommend this book.
5,Love!,I always love Rachel's books and this was no exception. The Chinook's series is my favorite. Looking forward to reading more.
4,Fun read,Fun read with likeable characters. It has humor and romance. She is a great contemporary romance writer. Try it and you will like it.
4,I enjoyed it.,Cute story. I thought it was fast-paced and entertaining. Loved the hockey aspect as well. Looking forward to reading some of her other books.
4,Fun and Hard to Put Down,"Even though Jane is not a sports reporter, she's assigned to cover the Seattle Chinooks hockey team. She and the goalie, Luc Martineau, start off as antagonists, then friends, then lovers. This is a light, fun novel, better than your standard romance. The only thing I found lacking concerned the supporting characters-- in general, I think Rachel Gibson could do a better job of fleshing them out and adding more of them to her plots."
4,I almost didn't read it....,"At first this was one book that I was tempted to put down. The story takes place in Seattle and Gibson keeps talking about Luc's ""Canadian accent"" and how he so adorably says ""aboot"" instead of ""about"". Give me a break! There's nothing that annoys me more than American's talking about our ""accents"". But I persevered and continued on through and thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was light, witty, and just plain fun."
3,Good Score,"I liked this book, I am really hockey fan so it make the book more of exciting. I liked how Jane stuck her guns and worked as the reporter in the story.. As much as I liked this book, I did like Body Check and Fair Play in turns of sports and romance."
2,I loved the others,"I dearly love Rachel Gibson novels. Her heroines are always charming and her heroes great. And they are funny.But not in this book. In the first place, I cannot admire a woman who supports herself by writing porn.More of a problem is that Jane cannot believe Luc could love her because she's not tall, blond and gorgeous. She is more shallow than the hero. She cares for him because he's a star athlete who's gorgeous and sexy and has a great tatoo.I think it needed another edit. Parts are rough and the motivation fluctuates. I still can't see why the hero changed his mind in the end except he had to or the book would not have ended happily."
5,Much better than the first in the series...,"This book was better than the first in the series - the relationship between the hero and heroine was much better developed, with a gradual and more realistic progression to their happily ever after. The reader believed it when they overcame their obstacles and fell in love with each other. The plot was good and the pacing was faster - more of a page-turner, and themes weren't repeated over and over as they were in the first book. A good read by this author and vast improvement over the first in the series (and several of her other books in different series)."
2,Ms. Gibson needs a new editor,"""Nancy boy?"" Seriously, who speaks like this? The dialogue was not just unbelievable, but just terribly awkward and goofy. I can deal with an unbelievable plot line -- this is a romantic fantasy, afterall. But graphic sex scenes do not make up for cringeworthy writing.Plus, there's one thing I really couldn't forgive: When Jane is in Detroit and looking out her window ... at Lake Michigan?!? Look at a map Ms. Gibson! Lake Michigan is hundreds of miles away, on the other side of the state! How does this $@%# get by an editor?"
4,"Good sexy, romantic read..","At first I couldnt picture Luc and Jane together because he was such a jock, and he was into blond,big-boobed women. As the story evolved I started wanting these two to get together. I really liked that despite the fact that he was a jock, he wasn't as chauvinistic as Rachel Gibson's other male characters tend to be."
4,A Good Read,"Maybe it's just me but it seems like all Rachel Gibson books start off extremely slow. Many times I have started her books only to lay them aside for a while. Once I pick it up again, ultimately, it becomes an interesting and fun story.Since you already know the plot of the book, I won't go into that. I just want to say that I did enjoy this book. The characters were well-written and likeable. I especially appreciated that the heroine was strong and independent and knew how to get the job done without a lot of whining. Of course, the male lead is a strong Alpha male who every woman dreams of and wants. Oh, how delicious it is when the strong man falls for the woman he never thought he'd want! It's just yummy!"
3,"Cute,","Dont get me wrong I enjoy Rachel's work, but it the same story over and over. I have read about 5 of her books, and I will not read the rest. It's one of those things that once you read one you read them all. I would love to see her try her hand at something different, out of her element."
5,Awesome! Couldn't put it down!,"I've never read any of Rachel Gibson's books, but the plot description got me--I'm a huge sports fan (baseball mostly, but I do enjoy hockey) and I love romance novels--so here's my two faves in one. And I wasn't disappointed! I laughed out loud, cried a little....and loved it! Yeah, certain things are predicatable, but all in all, it's a great read. I loved it so much, I bought 2 other of her books."
5,Great and fast read,As a fan of all of Rachel Gibson's books- this one lives up to all my expectations! The characters are lively and fun to read about. Anyone who loves Gibson previous books will highly enjoy this one and new fans will find that this is a great start to their collection.
5,Great Read,Rachel Gibson doesn't know how to disappoint readers! I couldn't put it down and did not want it to end.
4,Very funny fast read,"This was my first Rachel Gibson and I have to say I adored it. Jane is great, my favourite kind of heroine. I proceeded to buy her entire back list and she's now an auto buy for me."
3,I really expected to be hooked,"from the first page, but found this story to be slow getting into, and for that alone, the 3 stars. The book finally started picking up some speed and I found I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was funny and the characters were highly likeable. Miss those dogs though....."
3,Just OK,"I was hoping for more with ""See Jane Score"". It had all the typical elements you look for but the delivery was a little too predictable. Not a bad book, but not at the top of my list of recommendations."
5,Excellent as always,"This is the second time timepiece read this book, and its just as good as the first time.. I love hockey love"
4,Just as I remembered,"I loved this show growing up, and now I get to watch them again. My four year old daughter likes to watch it with me. Its a great product and definately worth the money."
5,An Awesome Season!!!,"After I saw the incredibly awesome Land of the Lost movie, I wanted to see the series it was based on. I was new to the series, and I thought it was pretty good! They have good plots, cheesy special effects, and much more. On a routine expedition, Marshall, Will, and Holly meet the greatest earthquake ever known. They are transported to the Land of the Lost, and try to find their way back home. Throughout the season they must deal with a T-Rex named Grumpy, befriend a Pakuni named Cha-Ka, escape the Sleestak, seek Enik's help, meet a friendly dinosaur named Dopey, and much more. I highly recommend LAND OF THE LOST: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON!!!"
3,The Land of the Lost-1st season,It was fun to show my kids the way television used to be when I was a kid.
3,LOTL RULES,"I have to admit I was so excited about this release. Saturday mornings just are not the same anymore. But, I am dissapointed in the quality of the picture. I figured they would have restored them better. Other than the crappy picture I am thrilled to own this collection."
3,an old show i use to watch in the 70's,i got it but not pleased. the piture quality and sound was not that great. outside in the open. especially by there cave. the people looked like cut outs. some of the film was not restored. my favorite was when they visit the lost city and the ending song. which i forgot.
5,excellent viewing if you remember it as a kid,"The 1st and 2nd season were thought out and written better than the last season. The stories were all still interesting even as an adult. It was also fun seeing the special effects of the 70's. If you watch these again as I have, you'll probably enjoy them again and if you have kids most will enjoy them too. One last comment, notice how there are never more than 3 sleestack in a scene through all 3 seasons!"
4,Cheesy but fun entertainment,"Both my wife and I watched this show when we were kids, and seeing it again is very nostalgic. The best part though is that our own kids - ages 7 through 12 - all get a kick out of the show just as much as we do. Yes its corny, and yes the special effects by today's standards are awful, but that is part of its charm. The kids now want us to buy the entire series!"
4,another perspective,"The Russian Fighting System (""Systema"") is different than any martial art I have ever seen. They use very few linear strikes and blocks and the whole art has a very flowing quality to it. It is effective but will take some training - like everything else! If the art is new to you, check out some video clips on the net.TRS sells the original as a 3 volume set. The production quality is not as high as some of their other products and there is a voice-over translator to help with the Russian. However, there is good substantive content."
3,Beautiful book but not for bedtime reading,"This book is a beautiful book from an illustration perspective. However, it is not for bedtime reading with young children. The stories are quite detailed, and reading verbatim will take longer than anticipated. This book is best suited for the motivated child who reads well.As well, the book is titled as a Jewish Bible story book. However, the table of contents lists the stories as being part of the Old Testament, a clearly Christian perspective."
4,Great starter book,"I have been reading this book to my 5 year old grandchild. Regardless of whether a parent intends to raise a child in a religious household, I believe it is important that children understand their cultural heritage, which includes knowing the stories that make up their (and their ancestors') religious heritage. When we read the stories in this book, we also talk about what they mean or the lesson being taught. The lovely illustrations help hold my grandson's interest. When we come across the few words with which he may not be familiar, I tell him what they mean. It is amazing how much a child retains. I will leave it up to my grandchildren to decide what they want to believe when they are older. I agree with reviewers who note that this book is as appropriate for Christians as for Jews."
1,Unuseable and unreplaceable,"Received this as a gift a year ago. Pulled it out of the box set it up with a stew and when I got home... Well, the stew was all over the cabinet. Upon further review, I found two hair like cracks in the pot itself. Was unable to get it warenteed and couldn't even find a replacement crock. Have been a crock pot user for decades,but won't buy one of these."
2,Burned the meatballs slow cooker,Even on low it seemed too hot and burned the meatballs. I also noticed and agree that the stoneware was chipped on the bottom. Not happy with that quality. Also the handles of the base get really hot so use caution when picking it up. The weird shape inside makes stirring very difficult. I am so disappointed that I am returning mine to Amazon. I will then order another one to try. I will keep my fingers crossed it isn't as bad as this one!
3,Loved mine until the handle broke,I really liked the fact that it was not Teflon and could be used on cooktop and oven as well as on the slow cooker. I'm now looking for a cast-iron crockpot. That would resolve the only problems I experienced. 1. You could saute on higher heat 2. The crock won't break.
4,"Good product, but would be nice to have timer...","This crockpot is very nice and can be used on stovetop, oven, or its own base. It is definitely the most attractive crockpot I have seen."
2,Too fragile,Shortly after I purchased this slow cooker the lid chipped. A couple of weeks later a handle broke off when I was washing it and accidentally bumped it against another dish. I've never had this problem with other slow cookers. Now I don't know whether to pitch the whole thing or purchase a replacement liner and risk the same thing happening again. I wish I had purchased a different model.
2,VersaWare Doesn't Stand Up,I bought this slow cooker for my wife for Christmas because of its looks and its promised versatility. In these departments it delivers. Where it falls down is in the durability of the stoneware. Right out of the box ours was chipped slightly on the bottom. Within a week it had developed a crack and had to be returned. The pot is lighter than other slow cookers which is nice but the trade-off seems to be that it has to be handled with kid gloves. I'm going back to a regular style of slow cooker.
1,Very Disappointed,"After slightly over a year, the liner developed a couple of chips and, upon closer examination, two cracks along the height of the liner. These developed the last time I used it--in one use and for no apparent reason. Though I love the way the cooker looks, I've never used it for anything other than slow cooking so its versatility is useless to me. Even if a replacement liner was available, I would worry this would happen again (with food inside?) so I'm going back to the stoneware style--which lasts many, many years."
2,Semi-Functional,"I didnt have any heating problems with this unit, other then the fact that the crock handles were insanely hot, and the unit was rather hot in general.The major problem I have is with the weird shape and how fragile the crock is. The shape means that things dont fit in naturally. A pot roast has to be cut before it fits, a lamb roast needs to be shoved in. A bag of meatballs doesnt fit fully, but in a normal pot it does.Bottom line, I wouldnt buy it again."
4,Handles are delicate,This is a great slow cooker but the handles on the insert are delicate - one broke almost immediately.
2,"versaware - strange shape, too hot","I have the 6 quart oval Versaware Crockpot. I was so excited that I 'd be able to brown food before slow-cooking it! I am very dissapointed with the results of my 1st recipe - Beef Stroganoff. While browning the meat, one spot on the bottom of the crock began burning and smoking! None of my regular pots have problems with uneven cooking, so its not my stove. Then, even on low temp, with sauce, the meat stuck to the sides of the crock. I will try another recipe, but am afraid this new model cooks too hot to be useful."
1,Poor Design,"I have used this three times, I now have a crock pot with no lid. The lid and pot are made from the same material so I assume the pot will break just as easily!The lid is heavy which in it's self is not a big deal till you factor in heat. You can not hold it with out protection and with protection you can not hold it! The handle is poorly designed. You can not get fingers and hot pot holder between lid and handle, there is not enough room There is no way to get ahold of anything but the outer edge of the handle when hot, and no way to grip it safely. It slipped out of my grip 1 inch from the pot and split in half"
2,disappointed,"I like the cooker well enough, but am disappointed in the durability. Both handles on the crock pot broke off within the first three times using it (not due to excessive force). The broken edges are very sharp and it's a pain to use it now (2 months old).The recipes in the book are so-so. Overall not very happy with the purchase."
1,Kitchen soap dispenser,"The item looks very nice, but the soap dispenser does not work well at all. Continuous pumping results in a minimal amount of soap (and I'm not using thick soap). Very disappointing purchase."
1,"All show, no go.","I've used this on a daily basis at my kitchen sink for about a year now. It does not perform.(1) Coats the countertop with a messy layer of liquid soap every week or so.(2) Needs ""re-priming"" if several hours elapse after the previous dispensing. (Seems to ""suck air"", then needs Pump, pump, pump pump before soap comes out.)(3) Over the course of a week or so, this dispenser coats its own exterior surfaces with a messy layer of liquid soap. The soap exudes near the top where metal cap meets the ceramic body.(4) Even when primed (see item 2 above) it is hard to dispense the desired amount of soap. As you gradually push down on dispenser, the corresponding amount of soap that comes out goes: nothing...nothing...nothing...a lot. Sometimes we just want a little bit of soap."
3,Pretty but has leaky dispenser,I came here looking for a new soap dispenser and sponge holder because I am not happy with this one! I love the looks of it but the dispenser and top don't work properly and soap is always leaking out through the lid and creates a mess. So...if you don't mind the extra daily cleanup it's fine but I'm going to keep looking for one that works better.
5,An exciting supernatural mystery.,"McKenzie, a high schooler with physcic powers, knows there is something strange about her best friend Lilicat's second hand Halloween costume. It's not just that Lilicat is acting strange - McKenzie has gotten awful visions that lead her to believe Lilicat is possessed by an evil spirit. Now she must help both her best friend and her boyfriend before the spirit kills them. I highly reccomend this suspenseful story to teens who like horror and mystery stories."
2,Disappointed,I had thought this would have better entertainment value. However it is much like a movie that has all the right componenets but just misses being either a good or great movie.
1,A Big Diappointment!!,My 6 month old son is scared of this toy!! The volume is way too loud and when the blocks come crashing down it makes him cry!! Please save your money because there are so many other toys out there that will entertain and delight your children. This is the worst toy I have ever bought and I regret ever buying it. I wish I had kept the box so I could return it for something else.
1,I spent money for this?,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 1 month with the expectation that she would love it when she got older. I'm still waiting. The first time I put her in it, she clinced her fists and I turned it on and she screamed so hard she was shaking. I left it out thinking she would get use to it, she won't even go near it. I tried to give it to a friend who brought it back for the same reason with her son. Too loud, very overwelming for a baby. A waste of money in my opinion."
5,Keeps his attention!,"I bought this toy when my son was six monthes old because I wanted something that he would play with while sitting up. It was so loud, however, that it often made him cry. Around 9 monthes my son rediscovered this toy and LOVED it! He would easily sit for 30 minutes playing with this. At 13 monthes, it is still one of his favorites. He finds a variety of items from his toy bin to throw onto the spinning discs, and he dances to the catchy little tune. I only wish it had a volume button."
1,Annoying!,"My brother gave this to our son, a hand me down from his daughter. I can see why he wanted it out of the house! It is SO loud and annoying and I really dont see any value in it. With ll the great toys to choose from,surely you can find one more entertaining, and quiet, than this one."
2,"yes, annoying...",I agree with what was said about this item. A relative bought this for my daughter for Xmas and it truly drives everyone nuts while it's in operation. All the pieces clank around the turning wheels and it's LOUD! Plus that wacky music going over and over is only cute the first time you hear it. I don't think my 10 month old cares either way if she owns it. It was more me thinking it looked cute.
1,Not a Good Buy,This toy is not a good buy. My daughter didn't even want to play with it. Plus when the circles spin around it makes the little flowers fly off it. Although the music is good I give this only one star.
3,Not made for twins,We had some problems with the durability of this toy. The wheels stopped turning several times and the bands got off track. This is not a toy for a very active child. My twin would stand on it.
3,"Okay toy, but too loud!","This toy is ok. My son is almost 8 months old, he enjoys it for a little while at a time. He likes to lean on the spinning wheels and make them stop. The main problem with this toy (and many others that play music) is that it is TOO LOUD. My husband covered up the speaker with scotch tape to quiet it down. At first, the volume scared my son."
2,My Kids Don't Play With This,"We bought this for our son's 1st christmas. He was 7 months old. The first one we got broke the first day. Two of the wheels quit spinning and it made a loud humming noise. We exchanged it for another one, and this one still works 6 months later, but neither of my children play with it. They like to play with the toys that go with it, but they have no interest in putting them on the spinners and watching it spin. I'm disappointed I spent that much money on a toy neither of them plays with, but at the same time I had no idea how loud it would be. Not only is the music loud, but if the blocks fall and are spinning around too, it's extremely noisy. We have lots of noise makers so the noise isn't normally a problem for us. This toy just takes it to extremes. I would not recommend this toy. Big waste of money."
2,Loud and Easily Broken,"We got this for our son when he was less than a year old and it broke in a matter of weeks. The music is loud and it gets worse when the blocks fall down and get rolled around everywhere. Eventually the wheels/turning broke down too when he would lean onto the turning wheels to try and get the blocks that were being bounced everywhere. If you have an active child who wants to interact with it and not just sit and watch, then this is not the toy for them."
5,Favorite toy,"My son is 12 months old and still loves this toy. I gave it to him when he was 6 months old. He cried at first because of all the noise the many pieces make as the unit's wheels spins but quickly got over it. This toy could annoy many parents since it does not have a volumn control, it only plays one tune, has many pieces, the mat that comes with it is silly, and the unit is loud when the pieces are spinning on the wheel. With all that, I love it because it keeps my son busy for long periods of time and assists him in improving his hand-eye coordination. This toy is incredibly durable. My son drags and flips it, drops things on it and walks and stands on it without the unit missing a beat. Batteries last an unbelievably long amount of time, too. As he gets new toys, he always brings the new toys back to the Twirlin Garden to see how they'll spin."
3,"Cute, but I doubt the durability and it really only does one","While this toy is very cute and my son enjoyed watching it spin, it really one does one activity (the spinning) and plays one song. My son likes putting his hands on the swirling discs, but it stops them and you can smell the motor burning. It was also expensive, considering the other selections available, so we returned it."
1,One of the worst toys out there,"My grandson got this toy as a gift, and was first afraid of it, then became bored with it...He never really wanted anything to do with it, other than choosing the bee as one of his favorite little rattles...."
3,Twirlin Whirlin BOOORING!,"My son got this toy as a gift for Christmas. He is 8 months old and I personally wouldn't recommend it. The feature that I dislike the most is that the toy only stays on for about 45 seconds and plays the same boring song. So you have to keep pressing the button for any action. Maybe that's supposed to be part of its educational value. Yawn! Other reviewers have complained about how loud it is. I didn't see that to be problem. But, nonetheless, my son didn't like it either. He stared at it for a little while and then turned to some other toys. Oh well!"
4,This is my daughter's favorite toy.,I will never regret buying this toy. Even my husband likes to play with it!
2,How to make it quieter,"After reading all (or at least most) of the reviews, I don't have much new to offer. It is very loud even without the blocks and extremely loud when used with the blocks. Since I got the toy from my mother-in-law and didn't feel I could return it, I made the best of things. I put rolled up baby socks on the rotating discs so that my son could still watch stuff ""twirl"" around without being deafened.My son is not attracted to this toy. He only plays with it when I take him over to it and even then he is bored within minutes (with either the socks or the blocks)."
5,Fun,As much fun for Mom and Dad as it is for 11 month baby! Stands up to a lot of abuse. Really great song that plays for a nice length of time. Baby loves to start and stop it. Enjoys retrieving the the pieces as they twirl and whirl. Fantastic!
2,a waste,"I received this toy as a gift for my third child and was so excited because all of my hand-me-down toys from my other kids were getting a little worn out. It looked so cool from the box. It is very loud and annoying and impossible to keep together. The mat that goes with the toy is worthless and kept coming apart from the toy mechanism. The only thing that proved to be entertaining for my child was the stackable ""blocks"" that came with it. The spinning part of the toy just frustrated the heck out of my daughter. She wanted to stack the blocks and it was too hard for her to do on the rotating parts. Watching the blocks fall and fly off is probably fun for some kids, but my daughter preferred to just use the blocks alone one the floor."
2,Boring,"We received this toy as a Christmas present for our 6 month old. She glanced at it once and kept moving along. This toy really doesn't have much educational or fun value. If your child is passive and enjoys watching things move, then this toy will be good for him/her. However, if she's more of a ""do-er"" then she'll be as bored as our daughter was. The good news is the blocks fit to other Fisher-Price toys, such as the activity table."
4,Not as durable as it should be,I got this for my son when he was about 6 months old. I had to take the first one back because it didn't work. The second one worked well at first. My son loved to play with it but got easily frustrated because it spun around way to fast for little hands. After about 2 months of playing with it my son would lean on the spinning section while trying to grab the flowers (as I would expect most babies to do) and it stopped spinning all together. Nothing we did would make it work again. I feel the concept of this toy was great but it needs to be adjusted for infants. The spinning motion needs to be slowed down for younger babies. There should be an adjustment switch for parents to adjust the spinning motion. It also needs to be more durable. this toy should be able to with stand the weight of an infant with out breaking. It is a bit loud (that doesn't bother me but it does offend some people) there should be a volume control.
4,Entertaining but easily broken,"My 1 year old loved this but it didn't hold up very well. The belt that spun the wheels broke. My little girl wanted to hold the spinning parts still, which I think caused it to break. My husband fixed it once, but broke again right away."
1,Baby May Get Frustrated and Become Hyper,"We purchased the toy because it looked like a lot of fun on the TV commercial. It was set up in minutes. We did not feel that it did enough for our daughter. It does not promote good calm playtime.It plays one song, too loudly. (I hope the manufacturer is reading this) The toy would only get my daughter hyped up when she played with it. Everytime she would try to take a block off the stack or add one while it was running she would become frustrated because she could not succeed at the task.I would not recommend this toy."
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"FLOWERS DO NOT MOVE CORRECTLY, LOUD AND SCAREY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN PIECES GET JAMMED. PARTS EASY TO LOSE"
2,"Loud, repetitive, frustrating!!!","My triplets received this toy for Christmas when they were 6 months old. We didn't bring it out until they were 8 months old. My daughter and son were very disturbed by the loud music and clanking blocks that continually were flying all over. (My other son just stared at it.) I couldn't believe it! They are not fearful kids! I put it away and brought it out 3 months later...as soon as they heard the music...they ran! At this point I started to really look at the toy. It has no educational value, the same song is played and it simply spins. They enjoy toys that do more than ""one"" thing! I do not recommend this toy. It is so repetitive and meaningless. I can't believe some of the reviewers actually like the music! It has ONE song...how exciting is that to hear over and over and over? Sorry Fisher Price, I usually LOVE your toys. Not this one."
1,This thing needs an off button!,"This is an extremely annoying toy. It has no off button, so if you accidentally set it off, you HAVE TO listen to this inferno of noise and movement for several minutes. Our daughter got it for Christmas last year and we all thought it was terrible. We took the batteries out pretty fast and they've never gone back in. I think it definitely goes under the category of ""Things to Get For the Babies of People You Don't Like"""
1,Did I miss something?,"This obnoxious collection of plastic had my daughter in tears. Not only was she freaked out by the rattle of plastic moving all over the place and frequently spilling out of the ""tracks"", I was stunned at how thoughtless I was to purchase this toy for her. I should have purchased something less overwhelming and hyper-stimulating. She's almost a year old and she's not the type of kid who gets turned on by all the clamor, apparently. I would say that this is an outstanding mess of a toy, and a pointless noisemaker. Unfortunately, I give this a huge ""thumbs-down""."
1,Pass up this one!,"I loved the commercial - it made it look like a lot of fun but its not.My son received it as a gift at 6 months old and would sit in front of it but I had to do all the stacking, button pushing, etc... this is expected at that age. But now he's 14 months old and still has no interest in the toy. I kept pulling it out but other than clapping to the 1 and only song, it was not fun for him. My friends who have the same toy had the same reaction from their kids.I finally put it out on the street the other day - it wasn't worth the space it was taking up. There are MUCH better music and building toys out there - don't waste your money with this one."
5,Second time around,I bought this toy for my 5 month old. Now he's 1 1/2 and I had to finally put it away so that my 4 month old can play with it. My first loved it from the beginning. He would get all bouncy when he would watch the toys go around. He liked it so much he even fell over on it a couple of times. I had to finally put it away because he would put everything on it and watch it spin. I hope my new baby will love it as much. I'm going to buy one for my nephew for christmas. As far as the one song. It's loud but if it keeps their attention then it is definately worth it.
2,Disappointed,"I have to say, my son got this at 9 mos, and to this day (13 mos) he's totally uninterested. When he even barely touches the toys, they fall over, and cause the twirlin to be all clunky (stuff kind of falls into the turning parts and makes TONS of noise) He couldn't care less about this toy. I think it has too much going on, and the stuff that's going on isn't educational."
3,Better for an older baby,I bought this for my five month old and every time I would put him in it he would burst into tears. Keep in mind that this child DOES NOT scare easily. The toy volume is set to blaring and there is no way to turn it down. At nine months old I gave it to his daycare and now my son and some of the older babies like it. It also sounds much less loud since someone is always screaming! I would definitely not recommend this toy.
3,Broke After Third Use,"I read the reviews of this item and ususally when a toy is given a high parent approval I know that it will be a good toy choice for my child. I never quite discovered the enjoyment this toy might have brought my daughter because the music and whirling twirling function broke only after three times of being used. I tried to find a way to fix the mechanism to make this toy work and it seemed like more trouble than it was worth. Also, the mat would not lie flat so I took it apart from the rest of the toy and let my daughter sit with it on the carpet. A much better purchase for me has been the wiggling jiggling bug, which my daughter began enjoying at 4 months and still enjoys today 10 months."
3,My 18 month old STILL plays with it.,My son received this as a gift at 6 months and enjoyed playing with it. It is still something he will go back to. He can now actually stack the blocks and enjoys seeing how high they will go before it topples. I bought one for each of my nephews this past Christmas and I hear they are enjoying it as well!
3,More interesting to adult than active infant boy,"I bought it when my son was 6 months, now he is 9+ and he still doesn't have much interest in playing nicely with this toy. He is a very active boy so that could be why. He never even tries to press the music button by himself. His biggest interest to stop spinning disks. As soon as he stops one disk with his hand, all other disks stop as well and my son looses interest. I like the music and find all the spinning amusing but not my son :)"
1,Too stimulating,My son received this as a gift at 5 months old. With all of the spinning and noise it absolutely terrifed him. So I hid it and reintroduced it (while holding him in my arms) at 8 months and he is still terrified. In fact I can't even sit him in it while it's not moving about.
4,Love this toy!!!!,"I got this toy for my 6 month old for Christmas. She absolutly loves to sit and watch the little blocks fall off and crash and go round and round. She loves the blinking lights as well. She has the help of her 21 month old sister to push the button. She will figure it out soon enough. They play with this toy forever. It is very durable, my 21 month old kicks it and bangs it around constantly. they are both happy just watching it and stacking them up and my 6 month old knocks them down and laughs. It is very loud, but worth it to find something that will hold their intrest for more than 5 minutes."
4,lasts a few months,"My daughter received this toy at christmas and liked it. However, it started making humming noises and two of the wheels stopped spinning the week we got it. Now, in May, it is totally broken and doesn't go at all. She had only played with a few times prior to it breaking. It's a piece of garbage and poorly made. I wouldn't waste my money."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this for my 9 month old boy. He didn't like it at all. It makes noise and spins around, however, there is no interaction. He just stared at it and then would move on. I threw it in the trash!Save your money!"
3,I RETURN THIS TOY THE FOLLOWING DAY!,"I brought it base on the the pretty good feedback it has but I was quite disappointed when my son and I played with it.I really like the color and the design of this toy as it is very attractive to the parent and as well as the baby. But once you started the toy, the music is nice but is very loud and also thestacking toy flips over when it starts to twirl and sometime it even got stuck .My baby was 8 months old when I brought this toy andhe just love throwing those stacking blocks away !They were all over the place. I just regret buying it !"
2,This toy scared my kids at first,"It is very loud. My kids didn't know what to think of it. Two of the wheels quite spinning. The flowers never worked right. It was a gift from out of state, so we just played with it the way it was. The song that it plays is very annoying."
2,This toy is hidden at the top of my closet!,"When my daughter 1st rcvd. this gift, she was around 10mos. old. I thought at first that this would be a good way to teach her cause and effect; push the button and make the toys swirl around. However, when she grasped this concept and pushed the button, it scared her to death! The music is VERY loud and if the little toys that stack up fall over, they swirl around and just bump into each and other and cause a ruckus. She didn't play with the toy again until she 18mos. and by then she liked to stack up the toys, push the button, and knock them over on purpose! Needless to say this got to be just a little annoying after a while. The toy now sits at the top of my closet, and my daughter never even really noticed it was gone. Out of sight, out of mind!"
4,Great entertainer!,"We recently received this as a present for my 6 month old son. He has been sitting up since he was 5 1/2 months so I needed a toy that he could sit up and play with. Whenever he lies down to play with a toy, he rolls and rolls. Well, he loves this toy!! He like to watch the stackable pieces go around in circles. He also likes to knock them over and watch them spin around on the four spinners. The music is cute but gets to be a bit annoying after a while however, he likes it which is more important. It is easy for him to turn the music off and on. The lights flash while the toy spins. I also like the little mat where he can sit and play with the pieces that fall off. My three year old like to play with it too! A great toy for when a baby can first sit up!!"
2,too noisy and frustrating,"We bought this toy for our seven month old son and I've already gotten rid of it. It is very loud and confusing- if the pieces aren't placed exactly right they just flop and clunk around in a confusing noisy mess. I found it to be over stimulating for our son- imagine four spinning wheels and around 10 pieces of hard plastic ""characters"" flailing about. There is no volume control for the music but even more annoying was the noise generated from the misplaced pieces knocking into eachother. The mat area for them to sit in was also impractical. My son found it confusing and frustrating."
5,My child's Favorite,"My child loves this toy. From the time he was able to sit until today (he's 19 months old), he has spent numerous hours playing with it. He loves to stack the blocks and watch them twirl. He has also used stacking rings to stack along with the blocks. It has been a hit with him and I'm sure that you're child will enjoy it too!"
4,The whole family plays!,"We all (ages: 5,1, and 31) enjoy this toy. The music is jazzy, the stacking pieces are colorful and unique in design. We love to try and catch the stacking pieces as they swirl around the circles. We never attached the mat (it didn't seem like it would provide any padding or real benefit). My son (13 mo.) can turn it on and likes to climb on it. It plays two rounds of chorus then shuts off automatically. It is a bit loud, but the tune is so catchy that we don't mind."
3,Twirlin Whirlin Overstimulation,Guaranteed to Create an enabled ADD child who cannot play by himself. Snappy Tune grates on nerves of family pets and this is not convenient to pack and carry. Stick To The Silly Symphony. This music is far superior and it is much more versatile.
3,NOT THE LEAST BIT DURABLE,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my 8 month old son. I gave it to him a week prior to Christmas. It lasted 3 days. The pieces spin around on the spinners very fast which is very frustrating to my 8 month old. My son leaned on the spinner to catch the pieces and the toy broke. There is a piece which snaps in and is supposed to be like a seasaw. My son immediately tore this piece off. This toy plays the same music over and over. I would not recommend this toy.
4,Enjoyable but not durable,We bought this toy for the son we were expecting...when he was old enough to play with it it only lasted about a month before the discs stopped spinning. Terribly disappointing because he loved the lights & music. I don't believe it was used incorrectly or excesively. The only silver lining was that Fisher Price stood behind its toy and sent us a new one. A very good reason to buy from who you know.
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this toy for my son last Christmas when he was 6 months old. I thought it looked like a lot of fun. He could not really use it until he could sit on his own. He seemed to like it, but it would always stop twirling and just play the music. If I took the batteries out and then put them back in it would work again for a little while. Eventually the rubber band type things that make it twirl came out and now it just plays music and sometimes shows lights. I am just going to throw it away. I would not recomend this toy, it is a waste of money."
3,not a terrible toy,"my mother bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. she loved it! she loved to see the spinning and she didn't mind the noise, i did, but if she likes it, i don't mind the noise if she enjoys it so much. but it is definetely a daytime toy! the problem i had with it was that she liked to make the spinning circles stop spinning and shorted out the thing after two weeks. i changed the batteries twice and nothing. so now it just sits there. so personally i think the durability of the toy stinks. if it can't survive for at least a month of sporadic or even steady play, it's not the toy for my little lady!"
4,Disappointing,"My son (7 months) loved this when we first put it out for him. The music was obnoxiously loud...but he LOVED it. Unfortunately the toy only lasted a week and a half. Then the wheels stopped spinning. My husband took it apart and tried to fix it...but it was next to impossible. I am going to try to call fisher price to see what they will do about it, since we have since thrown away the packaging and we do not have a receipt since it was a shower gift. I would not recommend this toy! It is not worth the money and aggravation."
4,This is a very favorite toy in our house,"This was gift for our daughter's first Christmas. It has engaged her interest for over two years now, (whether or not we like it or not)! Yes, the music is a bit loud, but she seems to like it. The big colorful pieces were perfect for little hands. At first she just played with them, but this toy alone taught her to sit up by herself (when she played with it she would balance herself). As she has gotten older, she learned how to turn it on, stack the pieces, and even color code them. It is a big favorite and I don't usually take the time to rate toys online..."
3,"Sad movie, crazy, and no love sex",Tsumugi is really sick teenager. Sora acting liked 12 years old. She is very cute girl. She has very nice body. Even she is short. The first naked secene needed more work. The director missed the one major part at the first on bed scene. Katagirl should take off Tsumugi's dress and underpant in front of the camera. The other mistake of this director. The sex scence should be longer and more fun.She die at the end of movie. It's very sad. Nice girls shouldn't die.
1,nonsense,"If you never seen Japanese movies dont start with this one. Its not really bad but the girl is average looking, movie itself is low budget, colors lousy and I always remember Tokyo in reality which looks like science fiction. Visit Tokyo and you dont need any Japanese movie."
4,Great source of information!,"The Wilmington's Bible Handbook is a great source for Bible Study. It gives you background information about the writers, purpose for each chapter, and an outline of the chapter to guide you through. It helped me to answer questions on my Biblical Studies exam. Wonderful book!"
3,good,"received in timely matter, would buy from you again, the book was as I expected it to be. thank you"
2,Keep Looking,"Upon opening the book I was not impressed. The amount of actual research put in by this author seems minimal. If you would like books to help shed greater light on the Bible, try authors like Dr. V. P. Wierwille or E.W. Bullinger. This book is more like a maybe could have been book, not one that can add much to the accuracy of God's Word, this book can be used as a half way decent Bible dictionary."
3,Luther Vandross - This is Xmas,he can sing (yes) i did not care for it that much other than it is luther.. he does have other xmas cd that are better
5,A must have for the holiday season,"I've owned this cd for a very long while now! And this one i purchased was for my mother in law and i know she'll love it....When thinking about holiday music, this is a definite must have.....It's a wonderful album!"
2,Remastered..BUT NOT Expanded ?? W.T.F.!!,"When I saw the updated cover art for Luther's Christmas CD, I just knew they added the 3 missing songs, which are found elsewhere! Nope!! At any rate, if you wanna improve this classic holiday CD, EXPAND IT with Luther's 'May Christmas Bring You Happiness', 'At Christmas Time', and 'The Christmas Song' (chestnuts roasting)!!! These 3 songs are off the chain, and Luther didn't sing, he SANG them!! You can find these tracks on the 'R&B; Christmas', 'Slow Jams Christmas, Vol.1' & 'A Very Special Christmas 3' (the green cover) CDs. It's a shame the record company failed to expand the CD, but after adding the songs yourself, you'll have an improved 13 track holiday classic!Happy Holidays, S.D.(from 'Chaka's World')"
5,holiday spirit,Xmas is not the same without Luther'voice to serenade you each day during this time and beyond. His voice just melt away stress and relaxes the soul
5,I love this cd.,I had a copy of this CD when it was originally released. I usually start playing it after Thanksgiving and continue until New Years. This year I could not find my copy so I purchased another. I can't wait to get it. The holiday season is just not the same with out it.
2,looks outdated,"Unfortunately the book looks outdated, terrible illustrations. ""The visual story"" is much more modern in my opiniion and covers the visual subject with lots of color ilustrations."
2,More history than composition.,"While this book does cover composition, most of it is about the history of film and television, and about different styles and genres."
1,Not very Helpful with RHEL5,"Having built clusters of up to 42 servers with RHEL5, I was hoping this book would help me understand the reasons why certain aspects of the clusters I manage behave the way they do.This book focuses on topical issues and not much towards details. It might be helpful for someone thinking about a cluster, but there is not enough meat on the subject here."
4,cluster,very good service on the delivery. The book seems complete and useful for the work I undertake. Many pictures and diagrams to explain concepts.
5,GREAT BOOK!,I can't believe nobody has wrote a review for this book! I first bought The Breastfeeding Book by Martha and William Sears. That book was boring and awful. They are negative people. I had already read The Everything Pregnancy Book and The Everything Baby's First Year Book and LOVED them both so I decided to buy this book. I couldn't put this book down. The information in this book is very helpful and I still look back in it. My baby was in the NICU and her first night she was fed formula in bottles. The second day she was fed my pumped breast milk and formula because my milk was still coming in. She got used to the bottles and made it VERY CLEAR she was not interested in learning how to latch on. I use the nipple shields made by Medela so I can breast feed my baby. Even though I use the shields I still have questions and this book answers them all! You WON'T regret buying this book!
2,basic book,"As a first time mom I am reading lots of books and this one was my first on breastfeeding. I was disapointed. Not knowing much about breastfeeding besides friends and family, this book did very little to educate me further. Plus it seems out of date."
1,Find a support group,"None of the books out there are really going to be that helpful. My advice would be to see a lactation consultant before you leave the hospital, and then find a good support group. Many hospitals that have good birthing clinics also have wonderful support groups. That will be more helpful than any book."
2,Be Careful!,"Okay..here is the deal with these types of books: I ordered, recieved and read the book from beginning to end. Alot of information and very easy to read. When I had my son-my mind went nuts with all the information and I ended up having a complete breakdown over a pacifier!!! Very Very Informative but remember: it's all trial and error!! There is no ""proper procedure"" for nursing your child!"
3,great concept but don't work for me,"The kneepads are a great concept but don't work for me yet.Pros: Well made, pretty, and have a great cushion and nice strapsCon: On bare legs the pads slip down. I need something to protect my daughter's knees when she wears a dress or shorts. The pads are a little bulky, however my daughter is petite, so they may be fine for a larger child. The worst problem is that my daughter strips them off.Try cutting a hole in a pair of old socks first."
2,Did not work for us,"The exposed velcro on these snagged the rug or carpet as my baby crawled, and pulled the rug up with him. We have a gigantic baby, so may not be a problem for others."
2,Only lasted a week,"We were excited to find these kneepads for my 7 month old daughter. Since it is summer, she wears clothing that exposes her knees and our carpet gives her rug burns. We bought these kneepads hoping that they would keep her from rubbing her knees raw. They did cushion and she did wear them for a week. The kneepads did not slide off her skin, that we were pleased of. However, the velcro that keeps the pads on the knees completely came apart at the seams. We are disappointed that this product did not last longer, especially at this price."
1,Not worth trying!!!,"We put these on our baby, and he stopped crawling. He just sort of dragged his legs behind him. He most definitely did not like the kneepads and they hindered him completely. We took them off, and sent them back. Dont waste your money or time on this item."
2,Great idea but needs improvement.,The first and most important thing about these pads is that they won't stay put for a long time. My son is a power crawler and they slip right off. You'd have to make them so tight that it would stop the blood flow in order to keep it in place. It drove me crazy adjusting them all the time. The other thing is the bulkiness. It really bothered my son and as much as he could he'd try to pull them off. I guess not very comfortable from his point of view. The material could be a bit more durable too. I'm afraid we didn't have much luck with these.
1,Only buy if your baby is bone skinny!,These knee pads are well made and padded but the straps are not stretchy enough or long enough so it will leave purple marks on your baby and cut off their blood supply! My son was 6 months old when I got these and he is not chubby at all just a normal breast fed baby with normal chubby legs and these will only work if your baby is SUPER skinny. If they change the straps on these it would be a good product.
5,Better than other knee pads out there,"My daughter had been getting severe carpet burns on her knees from crawling on our Berber carpet and wood floors and with the warm weather, I don't want to put her in pants all the time. I started looking for infant knee pads and was very unsatisfied with the other options out there. They were way too thin. The Snazzy Baby Knee Pads are GREAT! They are soft and squishy for her little knees but are very durable. She does get a little bothered by them once in awhile and tries to take them off but I think she just wants to play with them. I would highly recommend these knee pads especially since they will be able to be used for years to come; even as elbow pads for me!!!"
4,These are great!,"These are much better than any other knee pad on the market. My 9 month old bruises very easily and these have saved her knees. There are only two things about the product I'm not crazy about: (1) They stay on best if they are put on underneath clothes, directly on the legs. I found that they kept sliding down if put on over clothing (2) They make the knees very warm, a possible negative in the summer."
2,no grip,"they slid around on our tile and our baby couldnt even crawl. they were padded enough, but didnt grip. we had to return them. waste of $."
3,Too bulky for crawling,I bought these for my 5 month old daughter who started crawling to protect her knees. They are too bulky for this purpose and also slide down and dont stay in place. I will save them for later. I think they will be great for roller skating etc.
1,Not Baby Friendly,"I purchased the baby knee pads since my little one was on the go. As soon as he figured out he could crawl, all he wanted to do was crawl. We have hardwood floors throughout the house and his pants were always making him slip. I found these knee pads and thought they would be great for him. Well getting them on him was a challenge since you have to slip them onto the knee rather than just strap them on. At his age he did not want to sit for a single second. If I was able to actually get them on him, as soon as he was on the go they would ALWAYS slip right off. For me they were a hassle and a wast of money."
1,BAD BAD BAD,The worst purchase from Amazon.It didnt fir on my kid's knee even for a second.i tried my best if it cud fit for a lil while but not.finally i had to return it.I am so scared that i m not even going to order any knee pads now.Very disoppointed.
1,good idea but.....,I loved the idea of these. We have hard wood and tile floors through out our house. However these didn't stay in place and were too tight on my daughters legs. I know of another person who bought them and said the same thing. Too bad I could have really used them!
1,Leaves marks and won't stay on...,These are a nice idea however they are horrible. I was so excited to get these so our son could use them on the tile and carpet. They will not stay over the knees and restrict the knee from bending so my son drags his legs. They are not slip resistant on tile or wood and cause red marks and bruising on back of legs as well. My son is 17lbs so he is not to chubby for these. Not to mention the velcro that was exposed behind the knee has snagged many socks.
1,HORRIBLE,"We bought these for our 9 month old son, who has severe hemophilia. We have only used them a week and they are so stretched out that they will not stay on his legs. We would like a refund, but can't figure out how to contact the company or at least we would like to try another pair. He needs the knee pads for his knees, and I feel like we just wasted 20.00."
1,Baby hates them..,I bought several different types this is my son's least favourite.. he will not have them on.
2,Too small,"I have a ""healthy"" baby approx 24lbs at 7mths and unfortunately since she has a little bit of meat on her these are way to tight on her. They didn't expand at all it was basically one size and your child would have to have very thin legs for them to fit comfortably."
4,Snazzy Pads,Excellent concept! It helped with our baby's transition from crawling to walking/falling outside. I only wish the velcro straps were a little longer...her legs are pretty chubby so the pads didn't fit for very long.
3,Prepare to leave your comfort zone to confront controversy!,"Quinn's novel is thought-provoking, forcing the reader to step away from the normal and ordinary human mindset. In a fictional framework, Quinn is able to address controversial and pressing issues, such as evolution, religion, and the nature of humankind.Quinn's novel kept me on the edge of my seat, and I oftentimes found myself in extreme contradicition with many of his rationales. I also found myself occasionally confused with Ishmael's reasoning. Yet the structure of this novel continues to keep the reader interested, carrying him to the last page."
3,Quinn spells it out for ya',"This is the third Quinn I've read (Ishmael then Story of B, being the other two), and I felt that, as a novel, it was quite poorly written, and somewhat uninteresting. But as far as putting forth his theories, this is Quinn's most lucid work (out of the one's I've read obviously). I think one of Quinn's strengths is that he is able to pack such a powerful - and actually quite simplistic - message into a fictional novel; he keeps the reader interested in the theory by keeping the reader interested in the story. Now, that's not to say that Quinn's ideas could not stand alone in a non-fiction work, for I believe they certainly can. But as a fictional writer, he is able to find a balance between theory and story, and I dont' think he achieved that here."
5,The Holostic Man's Guide To Knowing What's Up,"I want to make this short. I kept with this book for about a month before I finished it, but it was one of the most thought provoking and enlightening journies through literature I've ever experienced. From no other source have I gained such a profound and comprehensive knowledge of what's what and why in our world. He's given me the inspiration and purpose to do something with my life rather than remain another lazy 17 year old whom everybody saw had a lot of gifts but was always so dissapointed in his effort. I had no reason to give to life before reading these books. The life I saw around me was bleak and shallow and at best had some cool books for me to read. Well I've turned 180 degrees and I've got Daniel Quinn partely to thank for it. Keep on reading..."
1,Hate Yourself? You'll love this stupid book.,"Yet another cynical view of a world where life is great. No one likes to hear that, so they read books like this that make them feel bad about living in a world that gets better and better every day (...)"
5,"The answer to why you think ""something is just not right""...","Daniel Quinn uses this fictional sequal to add to what is already taught in Ishmael. He explains in greater detail why a lot of people may think that they have everything that they could ever want, but still have that deep down feeling of ""something is jsut not right"". Quinn explores the idea through a 12 year old girl and her teacher, Ishmael the gorilla. It questions our ways of living not by saying they are wrong but by stating that ""there is no one right way"". He does this through examining the school system, the government, workign 5-8 hours a day, and all of their uses.I would recommend this book to anyone because I believe that deep down we all have that feeling of ""something's just not right""."
4,Now I know why...,"This book makes you think, makes you think a lot. I enjoyed this book, even though it started out slow and was sometimes hard to swallow... a 12/13 year old girl (regardless of her parentage) going on a trip 'by herself' arranged by people she didn't know... other than an ape. But if you put the ape thing aside, this book is quite good, and like I said... makes you think about cultures and why things are done the way they are done... and know, that it is not too late."
3,My Ishmael Review,"Overall, we thought this book had a lot of positive and negative parts. It creatively taught lessons about how the world could be a better place. It also included many examples of how society and culture has changed. On the other hand, it was pretty dry and repetitive. It didnt have much plot and seemed to go nowhere."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"I am a great fan of Ishmael and as such was shocked by the lack of content in ""My Ishmael"". The book is disjointed and suggests an emotionally disturbed writer. The thought provocking portion of the book could have been written in five pages. The main character challenges believability more than a talking gorilla. This 12 year old girl puts James Bond to shame. The purpose seems to be creating excitment rather than communicating thought provocing questions as in ""Ishmael"". The two books are so different that I question whether Daniel Quinn actually wrote this book.The one redeeming point is his perspective on our educational system.To summarize: The book was so lacking in content that I would never have finished it had I not read Ishmael first. To the very end I hoped that there was some purpose in the direction that the story was taking -- but I found none. I felt deceived and cheated."
2,Pre-chewed food,"I borrowed ""My Ishmael"" from my seatmate on a transcontinental flight. The style is pedantic and ponderous, offering a few simplistic concepts repeated with only narrative variation rather than any sort of logical progression. This book will appeal to those looking for simple, quasi-mystical answers to to personal feelings of need and inadequacy. I hope it makes people feel better because it certainly won't inform them or teach them to think more critically."
5,deep resonance,"This book, along with ""Ismael"", contains ideas which until now have been lurking just beneathe the consciousness of myself and, I suspect, most people. The words and examples Ishmael gives are so clear and inspiring that I, a slower reader, was able to read this book in record time and still hunger for more."
2,a lecture,This is book has a good idea but it is shown poorly- there is nothing other than dialogue and Neanderthal like descriptions of anything. I realize that the book is lacking description because of its main plot however he could at least tuck the point away in a single layer or two its almost distracting to see the points so clearly and quickly if i wanted to be hit over the head with a concept i would read a textbook or go see a lecture- not read a supposedly good book.Its definitely not near my top 50 books- sorry to be realistic
3,My Ishmael,This book is good although some parts were repetitive. We recommend this book because it is a good story and easy to read and provides valuable information about the environment.
5,Changed my life,"Like the title of this review says...it opened my eyes (and mind) to a larger awareness of perspectives and possibilities, all for the better."
2,A rehash of his other brilliant work,"I loved Ishmael, and picked this sequel up immediately after. Disappointingly, I didn't find any new concepts here. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a shameless attempt to make money by publishing the same content again, but it's close to that. Read Ishmael. That's a wonderful wonderful book. Then stop there. I wish Quinn had."
4,This book provided insight into improving our world.,"Quinn provides insight into the stories of our culture and encourages the reader to think more deeply about where these stories came from and how true they really are. His points are made through questions and answer sessions with a young girl, which makes the book enjoyable to read. He doesn't give the reader all the answers, but he provides a place for us to start understanding the world we live in and the world we are destroying."
5,Great Start.,This book had great information and went into detail about each technique. This is a good source of information for the person just starting to the intermediate level. I high recommend it.
1,A let down.,"I was let down by this book. everyone on this site thought it was great. however i found that it lacked alot of detail needed for a submission, and there was nothing about seting up submissions in this book. this book does have alot of submissions but many of them would be shut down by somone with less then a year in the sport. for the price of this book you can get something better that will give you more insight into the game of submission fighting."
4,Very good for what it presents,"This book is specificaly on no-gi submission moves. In that area, it is one of the better books out there, and a ""must have"" for anyone involved in submission grappling. The photos are pretty clear, and numbered in sequense so the reader can better understand what he's looking at. The author describes the moves from the possitions they are performed from (i.e., ""Submissions from the Guard""). The moves shown have less variety than LeBell's ""Grappling Encyclopedia"", but as such is less overwhelming. Only problem, like LeBell's book, is that the reader isn't shown how to get into these possitions. And I'd prefere to see some reversals. Still, overall, an excellent book, and I'd recomend it to anyone who wants to learn non-gi submission holds."
2,"Too big, uncomfortable...",This is based on the tommy gun foregrip which is nice for the tommy gun but not for defensive shotgun that you plan to practice with. It's not very comfortable and sends a lot of shock into your hand if you use the push/pull technique on it. The matching pistol grip they sell also has the same problems..It looks cool and gives you that duke nukem look but I switched to a knoxx breacher grip that really works but it's twice the cost.....
3,Nice but needed modifications,"This front grip was advertised to fit several shotguns including a Winchester 1300. When making the change for the factory forearm it was soon evident that the Tacstar grip was too long to allow the connecting ring to attach the system. My 5 shot 1300 required that I cut away ~2 1/2 inches of the front of the pistol grip to shorten back to the edge of the grip itself. After test firing 10-15 shells the nut mechanism came loose requiring additional modification using a ""Dremel tool"" to grind down more of the plastic and use of locktight to secure the nut."
4,Great Phone for the Price,"I am not one who likes a lot of bells and whistles included with my wireless phone. If you are the type of person that does, this is not the product for you. But if you simply need to make and receive calls, text, receive pix and check your email, then this is a great little bargain. The only draw back is that the phone doesn't have a camera. I guess I should have paid more attention before I bought it, but I assumed that cameras where pretty much standard on all cell phones these days. Other than that, I am pretty satisfied."
4,Yoda personally teaches you the secrets of the Force.,"Robert Beverly Hale's three books on Artistic Anatomy should be owned by every beginning and professional artist. Beverly Hale shows the reader that to become an adept draftsman,it is best to learn from the drawing masters of all time. Beverly Hale also tells the reader how the best figure draftsmaen,from daVinci to Degas,learned from the works of past great masters.Reading and learning from Robert Beverly Hale's three books on Artistic Anatomy is like learning the ways of the Force from Yoda himself."
5,Good to accompany a life drawing class,I bought this book quite a while ago and had difficulty getting much from it because I had never had an anatomy class or a life drawing class. Now that I am taking an intensive anatomy/life drawing class I find it excellent and a valuable resource. I have a very good class book called Classic Human Anatomy by Valerie Winslow to show me literal anatomy. This muscle is here and is called this. You need this. But the greatness of Robert Beverly Hale's books are to also show you how these muscles appear in classical drawings. This is a different matter all together. It is the difference between an academic diagram and a great drawing. You need BOTH books and a live drawing class model to get the whole picture (no pun intended!).
4,Master Class in Figure Drawing,Very pleasde with the book. However I believe it may have got damp in the mail (top right hand corner of book) but still happy!!
2,A good introduction but not great,"I found this book to be a mixed bag. First of all the book is too quick, it's not as in depth as I hoped it would be. There is too much words and not enough diagrams for my taste. Another issue I take is the type of models (body types) the book uses as examples. They all look like pudgy out of shape Roman era sketches which is rather dated for any contemporary art field. There are ZERO actual photos of people but rather charcoal sketches (some good, others decent and most useless). I would use the analogy that you wouldnt hire a home builder who ONLY studied how to make log cabin homes, so why would you buy a book that ONLY focuses on old world body archetypes that no one wants to see these days?"
4,enlightening,I purchased this book for my husband because he has a friend who has converted and wanted to basic understand about the religion. He thought this book was enlightening.
3,Somewhat biased info?,"I felt reading this book that there was a lot of ""our bible is better than theirs"" attitude. But, I purchased the book as an introduction to the Koran knowing absolutely nothing about it. For that purpose, I feel it did okay. I now have a better understanding of when it was written and how it was written as well as some introductory peeks at its content."
2,Not Really Necessary,"If a person can manage to pull the many disparate and occasionally perplexing pieces of the Bible together, there is hardly a need for a book for ""Understanding the Koran."" Centuries later, the Qur'an is still very coherent and straightforward reading, and the meaning nearly always easy to understand. In English, I am fond of a translation by Ahmed Ali (Princeton University Press); there are many other fine translations of the meaning in English available today. If you still want a more detailed interpretation, try a tafsir written by a Muslim. There are many fine ones available, and they have the advantage of not being written through the lens of a different (albeit related) religious tradition.When you've read the Qur'an itself, and perhaps a tafsir, then decide if you really think a book with this title and content is really necessary reading."
2,sermon,"This book is not a translation of the Koran. It is about the origin of the Koran and the past and current influence on the natives of the near east, with a similar discourse on, and in comparison with, the Christian Bible in comparison. Though biblical pertinent, it is really a long sermon by a Christian minister, with the application an urging to persist in trying to convert these people to Christianity. It is a good sermon, appropriate for a seminary, but neither dispassionate nor apologetic of the Koran."
5,Understanding the Koran: A Quick Christian Guide...,"This book is very easy to read and understand. It is written by a Christian Pastor who was raised in Saudi Arabia in a Muslim environment, giving him a depth of understanding of both Christianity and Islam. I have learned more from this book than from years of asking questions. This is definitely a great and informative read for any Christian wanting to understand the Koran."
4,Great Cd!!,This is a classic good cd from top to bottom. When this cd was released in 94' - 95' it was played at every club at the time. Great collection album.
5,Ulysses,"This album is actually the demo for the album, Robert liked to put out the demo and never record the actual album because he felt it suited the songs more. It was probably written regarding his divorce from Hilarie."
2,disappointing,"This book has many eye-catching photos, but lacks floorplans or other drawings that would assist in really understanding the development of wright's houses. I know he designed a large number of houses, but the ommissions of several key ones is dissappointing in a book that is attempting to be all-encompassing. The text is well written, but the photos, while of high quality, are more suited to a coffee-table book or magazine, not a scholarly volume on wright's houses. It is strange that an architect of such acclaim has so little by the way of documentation of the work, while many lesser known architects have exhaustive publications of every project, drawings, etc."
4,Wrights' houses at their best,"There are many different aspects to highlight when studying the work of one of Americas' greatest architects. The part of his work that is probably the most accesible, are his private houses. It was great to see all these houses together in one beautiful volume. The photographs are stunning, and it is great to see so much attention paid to the interior of these houses, as Wright was responsible for most interior design too.As a professional or just a fan, when you love Wrights' work and want to visually enjoy it to the fullest, this book is a must have. The only thing better is to buy one of his houses..."
4,Impressive book,"I purchased this book as a gift for a family member who is very interested in architecture. When it arrived and i had a look through the book i was very tempted to keep it for myself:) the format is wonderful with the book divided into sections which represent the different sytle periods and then dedicates pages to each house with interior and exterior high quality photos. The only dissapointment is that because of the number of houses featured you don't get an in-depth feeling for each house, just a couple of pictures that showcase each property. I guess editing was essential to keep this book to a reasonable size otherwise it would need multiple volumes. On another note, given the size and quality of the book the price represents excellent value."
5,Absolutely magnificent,This is without doubt the best FLW photo book - the photographs ooze warmth and care - magnificent is the only word to described this grand volume
4,Well photographed and well organized,"Wonderful pictures of his houses that I fully enjoyed. I also appreciated the chronological presentation of the photos so I could see the growth and development of his style myself, rather than just read about it. The text seems unimportant by comparison. I was somewhat disappointed that there were not more interior photos, but overall, well worth the investment."
5,"Clear, concise overview of Wright's architectural designs","This book was a wonderful eye opener. It will appeal to the reader for crisp pictures in beautiful settings and landscapes as well as the various style phases Wright went through architecturally. For Wright aficionados, there is a detailed, but not too intense history of his style, works and personal history as he changes design elememts during his career. Grand interior shots only enhance the overall attraction. The book will add diversity to anyone's collection."
1,Making Matters Worse,"If you want to make the game overly complex, as if it isn't already, then you need to buy this book. On paper the rules make sense and seem playable, but when implemented in the game they bring the role-playing to a standstill. Supplements like this simply take the role out of role-playing."
2,Nothing more than a pamphlet,"This 'book' is nothing more than a short pamphlet. I bought it because 'Is This Your Childs World' (ITYCW) was not available. 'ITYCW' is a massive book detailing procedures to removing allergens of all kinds from our schools, but 'Recognize and Manage' is the sort of thing you'd expect to have handed to you by a doctor after a diagnosis of asthma.Since 'ITYCW' is out of print, you may consider buying 'Is this Your Child' instead, but I would reccomend trying to get 'ITYCW' used if you can find it."
2,Not well made...,"I purchased an Acer aspire 5000 series about 6 months ago, worked fine until recently ,it CRASHED! and 2 times no less! had to reinstall harddrive to origional and lost ALL my data. plus Im getting a distorting line across my screen which goes away when I reposition the screen ( loose connection or something)..top shell of notebook very soft and flimsy.Not well made, going to send back.these Italians should stick to making cars..."
1,Be careful about system requirements,My daughter loved this movie so when I saw that there was a game out we were so excited. Then we received it. We were unable to ever get it to work. My husband has a PHd in Computer Engingeering so it isn't because we didn't try everything. On the box it says you must have a Nvidia Geoforce/ATI Radeon video card. I guess we do not. We are very disappointed.
3,"Not as clear as ""Interacting Particle Systems""","In preparation of this book I had read ""Interacting Particle Systems (IPS)"" by the same author.I found Stochastic Interacting Systems much harder than IPS. The proofs were much harder, in the sense that fewer details are given, and the steps from line to line are very large at times. ( This is particularly true for part III : Exclusion Process.) Also, the ""motivations"" -although still very good- are not as good as in IPS.The book is not self contained, in that without the knowledge of the relevant chapters of IPS (or equivalent...) it is problably VERY hard to read.The book ( like IPS) is virtually typo-free! A big asset, if it is used for self study."
3,Power Pop? Brit Pop?,"Nick Heyward, formally of Haircut 100, sounds as if he were still in the 80s. This is, in itself not a sin, but there is absolutely nothing that stands out on this album, it's not really bad, but it's not really good either, it just sort of lays there and begs the question: why bother? Truth is, there is no reason. I sold this baby."
5,Beautiful bargain!!!,"My husband and I fell in love with this set by accident! We were looking for something a little more over-the-top girlie, but this ""beautiful bargain"" set caught our eye and we are VERY happy! It's true, the on-line pictures don't do it justice - the ruffle is much cuter with the pink heart detail, the textures are great (fluffy bunnies and cotton tails), and the colors are much richer but not too ""Pepto pink"". In the store, there are more matching additions: thermal receiving blankets, fleece blankets, wall decals, wall border, lamp, etc. The set is a definite ""gem"" for the price!!!!"
5,So cute and a great bargain!!,"I took a chance and ordered this based on the one review. This set is too cute and very well made. I wanted a pink set with some brown because I thought it would match the natural crib I chose. The picture here doesn't do this set justice. The colors are a little bit brighter but not overly bright pink, a nice mellow blend of colors. The bunny on the comforter is a soft fuzzy material, very adorable brown bunny instead of a white one. The dust skirt is white with pink hearts which you can't see in the picture. No need to pay more for other pink bunny sets this one is wonderful!"
3,Showing its age,I have been doing my family tree and learned that my maternal grandmother's family came to Scotland from France via Northern Ireland. I really knew very little about who the Huguenots were so went looking for material.This is an old text and covers a very specific period but was definitely worth the read just to get a sense of the travails of Protestantism in France. Pretty remarkable what people did for their religious beliefs.
2,No No Quintet,I found the tales to be mismatched and the compilation rather dull. It is however better reading than a telephone directory.....I think.
4,Pretty cool,"So I got this for some random reason... can't really remember at this point. But it's pretty cool! The top of it is comfortable and smells nice. It seems to be pretty sturdy but there is some cardboard in it which isn't too noticeable, but when I saw it I somewhat questioned the build quality... Seems fine though.Anyway, nice floor mat to put below my Samurai swords and/or use as a platform for a bed(with a futon cushion) for any guests I might have.I'd buy another if I wanted to make into a queen size bed... :)"
5,A great book,I loved this book as a child and still love it as an adult. It is such a simply yet magical story. I look forward to sharing it with my future family.
1,Promising but does not deliver,"The tray has a very polished and beautiful stainless steel finish. The gel core makes the tray substantially heavy and the holes on top directly into the gel core made a thorough cleanup almost impossible.I was incredibly disappointed by this product. It did not keep appetizers ""warm"" for more than a few minutes. It did keep some appetizers cooler for a longer time but definitely not the ""hours"" it promised on the package. I followed instructions on heating & cooling the tray exactly and tried three times to make the ""warming"" work.I would recommend avoiding this tray and ordering one of the Maxim Warming Trays, which were perfect for keeping appetizers and even entrees warm."
2,Doesn't keep cold food cold,Bought this to keep food that needs to be kept at below room temperature while they sit on a buffet table. This doesn't do it.
4,Perfect,I did a lot of research before I selected this lens case. It holds my 70-300mm with the sunshade on plus it attaches to my Tamrac camera bag. It fulfills what I need. Great buy.
4,Rugged and integrates well,I have used this for a while now on my Tamrac Velocity sling pack so I could carry my larger Canon 75-300 along with two other lenses in the sling pack. Very durable and integrates well with the other Tamrac products.
4,Good Case for 70-300 mm telephoto lens,"Good Case for Nikon 70-300 mm telephoto lens. Good padding, good zipper for security. I would buy another if I needed it."
5,Very usefull to have.,It fits my Canon 75-300mm lens very nicely. What I like about this lens case is that it fits on the outside of my Tamrac Expedition 7 photo backpack securely. Also the lens case is easy to remove from the backpack and then I just slip it on my belt when I want to go light.
4,Tamrac M.A.S. Medium Lens Case -Black,"I am very pleased with the high quality of this lens case. I do wish it was a little wider, but I'm thinking I need to go with the Tamrac Pro series (see below) to get a wider case. A Canon 50mm f/1.4 USM lens with the hood reversed fits too tightly; difficult to remove the lens.Tamrac MX5341 M.A.S. Lens Case - Pro 50 (Black)"
4,Yes Sir,"Yes, Sir, this is the obnoxious flow of the East Coast Rap scene. This is the epitome of the New York Rap Game. The contagious mind set that sets the bar to the real game high and on fire. Production is tight and the flow is death defying. Don't step to this! He learned from the best. His name is Kool G Rap!"
4,Dice raw,"456 is a underrated thumping album. The title track spells out the game of celo. This is where you roll dice with 3 die. Only NYC area brothers roll this way and the hard drums will help you learn. T-ray and DITC maestro Buckwild bring the bangin beats, especially on Take Em to War and Its A Shame, and G-Rap demonstrates why he is the most influential thug MC from the NYC. Check Biggie, Nas ( who rhymes on Fast Life) and Jay Z if You dont recognize. This should be copped as well as his new bomb in the fall of 2K1."
4,He still is one of tha greatest!!!!,Tha album is just pure listening pleasure. If you're a true Kool G. Rap fan ya got ta have this one. For Da Brothaz has one of tha best beats I've heard in a while. Pick this album up and enjoy.
3,"4, 5, 6 is G. Rap in th' ice ages","Ay yo, this is not G. Rap in his DJ Polo days, and compared with earlier releases ""Road to the Riches"", ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Live or Let Die"", he dosen't display anything new. Half th' beats aren't ear-pierceing and neither are th' lyrics. Some of the guests even outshine him on this album. I'd recommend his latest release over this one yo.Beats- 3.5Lyrics- 3.5Guest apperiences- 4.5Overall- A rough 3.5"
3,OK album from one of rap's legend's,"G Rap dropped this cd without his man, DJ Polo, and to be honest I have heard much better from G Rap. All in all it is still an alright album. I only has 10 songs, and one of these being a remix to another song on the album. Guests are at a minimal which is good, but the production is not that good on this one. Dr. Butcher did 4 songs, Naughty Shorts T-Ray & Buckwild all did 2. It has one classic song but the rest are just ok. A good album to have for his fans, but he has made better work in the past and in the future at the time of this release.#2 - 7.5#3 - 7.5 (f/ sean brown)#4 - 6.5 (f/ B1 & Grimm)#5 - 7.5#6 - 7.5#7 - 8#8 - 10 (CLASSIC! - great beat -- f/ Nas)#9 - 8#10 - 7.5 (remix to #3)#11 - 8.5 (good beat -- f/ B1 & Grimm)Nathaniel Wilson -- Queens, NY -- 7/20/around 1968check all my reviews"
4,Good,"Catherine Palmer is a great writer, but this one is not as good as the other two in this series. It's a little long and draggy."
2,"Sometimes cute, but mostly tedious","I enjoyed the first two books in this series WAY more than this one. The character development here is sloppy, the dialogue seems forced, and I couldn't sypmathize with any of the characters, which is never a good thing. The writing just wasn't as good as the first two (not that the first two are exceptional), and I found myself bored many times throughout this book, hoping it would somehow get interesting. I'd recommend the first two to anyone looking for an enjoyable read, but this one isn't worth buying."
5,A great group.,"All of these ladies can sing well and they are all excellent musicians. I enjoyed them at a concert and I enjoy this CD. I call it folk rock, but there is quite a bit of good material on this CD."
4,socket set,Good impact socket set. Some sockets double as metric and standard. good sturdy case. I recomend this product for a starter set.
4,Impact sockets,This was just what I want to use with my new impact. Didn't cost me an arm and a leg. The sockets have preformed great and the price did not break my pocket book.
1,Garbage,"1st warning sign - opening the package and seeing that they were much thinner than my set of shallow 'Kobalt' impact sockets. 2nd warning - rounded off the inner points when the 14mm slipped off the nut during use. 3rd time's the charm - split the 21mm into bits trying to back off a nut, 2nd day of use.My gun is 650 ft/lb torque max, middle of the road, and still ruined these. Hate to see what one of the 900 ft/lbers would do... Everything Neiko makes is junk, they have officially ripped me off for the last time. If you plan on using these for what they are allegedly for, IMPACT GUNS, spend $20 more and get a set that will last."
1,LOOKS ARE DECEIVING,"Revised: They ""seemed"" to be of good quality - until I rounded the 3/4"" out using a MANUAL torque wrench to torque to ONLY 65 POUNDS! My Master Mechanic 3/8"" drive set does that regularly AND I HAVE HAD IT FOR YEARS.These seem to be of a very good quality - at least for someone who does not make a living with them using them every day. There are 14 sockets, and a case (total of 15). The case is just enough for the sockets, so there is no handle. I wish there was a 15 mm, but with an SAE set as well, I usually have it covered."
1,Save your time & money I am trying to return it now.,"My first use found that the inch socket rounded off a nut head. I found after I compared it to a Craftsman regular socket 12 pt (with a inch bolt) this set's socket was loose or over sized. Item 2 was this socket was made of ""mild steel?"" it was soft in my opinion because when I inspected it I saw scratches and inside it looked gouged after this single / first use. Checked some other sizes with known bolts and some other sizes were also loose. Another unsatisfactory item was the difficulty reading the size of the sockets. Case was not the same as the product image and very, very cheap."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,I Have a set of the SAE version which looks like the set pictured... What I received was nothing like the picture these have rust spots and scratches in them they look like old used sockets. That were repackaged and resold... I am Highly disappointed...
2,Authentic Paella Pan,"This is an authentic paella pan but I can't use this kind in the winter. This kind must be used on an open flame and it is very difficult to get clean after using because it takes using it a number of times before it is properly seasoned. Perhaps I am just getting lazy in my old age, but I think it is so much easier to prepare the ingredients ahead of time and then assemble them and place in the oven to finish and/or marry. This summer, I will have fun playing with the two pans I bough. I will use them on the gas grill outside. That is when this review probably should be written."
5,Great video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My granddaugher absolutely LOVES Yo Gabba Gabba. She watches her video over and over and keeps very entertained. I can say she has learned alot from her videos like ""don't bite your friends"" and ""the party in her tummy"" encourages her to eat. Its amazing the way she learns while having fun watching . We will be back for more............. Thanks..........."
3,Last good season,"Although the special effects were improved for season two, the stories were not quite as strong as in season one. I did enjoy some of these episodes, especially The Pylon Express. And listening to the commentary on The Longest Day may have been worth the price of the DVD set alone.If you enjoyed Land of the Lost or want to share it with your own children, I'd recommend Seasons One and Two."
4,Another Awesome Season!!!,"After I saw the extremely awesome Land of the Lost movie, I wanted to see the series that started it all! Return to the Land of the Lost with Marshall, Will, Holly, Cha-Ka, Enik, Grumpy, Big Alice, and the Sleestak! The Marshalls are still trying to get home, and throughout the season they must deal with Sleestak, the Zarn, help Cha-Ka steal a dinosaur egg, survive powerful storms, blackouts, and much more! I highly recommend LAND OF THE LOST: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON!!!"
5,Good to know how to succed in life,explain in simply words how to succed in life and ecourage you to go for the things you trust must
5,"Excellent book about many ""truths"" - great for college grads","I found this book to be an excellent treatise on the keys to success in any endeavor, from the arts to corporate raiding. Its hardnosed, practical, and contains a lot that isn't intuitive to a 20 year old and is painfully obvious to any 60 year old, looking back. Read it yourself. Give it to every college graduate you know. Give it to people who still have dreams, but have been stuck in that dead end career path for too long."
3,Good Read,"Explodes common myths about prerequistes to success. Illustrates other criteria mainly external focus for doing well. Success has been equated directly with wealth, one aggrandizes, this in my opinion needs to be viewed with a pinch of salt, at the same time not underestimating the liberating effect wealth can have on the way we live our lives. All in all an easy read, however number of examples cited by authors could have been curtailed."
5,important book that often overlooked.,"This is an important book on the PSYCOLOGY of RIDING your 'HORSES', and your chances of success. I think this is an important point that often goes unnoticed by the lovers of AL RIES and JACK TROUT materials. Reading this should make u pay more attention on RIDING THE 'HORSES' and beneficial to you. HORSES=your BOSS,FRIENDS,SPOUSE,FAMILY,etc..."
2,Unresponsive customer serivce,"I received this product and finished assembling the lawn sweeper. First time I used it, the part that had been pre-assembled fell off the machine and into the lawn. Without this part, I cannot use the machine. I have called Swisher Customer service three times and have not been able to get a person in customer service. I have been on the phone for approx 1 1/2 hours so far. This isn't customer service, it's no service. I may have to contest the charges if I don't here anything from them soon, despite phone messages and repeated emails."
3,Not sure,"I spray it (diluted) on cucumber plants to treat spider mites and on orange trees to treat scales. It worked OK on the scales, but I am not sure it did anything to the spider mites. Those little red critters are every where now, on cucumbers and string beans. I am still trying to find an ""organic way"" to treat them."
3,Love all,I would have mixed views on this collection of Tennis stories.The Book is cleverly divided into 5 sections and the Mixed/Doubles is excellent but the Sudden Death stories are weak .Paul Theroux is good on a Japanese player described as a freeloader.Sarah Totton andMartin Amis also excel but the whole collection could have done with some pruning before the final set.
2,Boring Rock Songs,I found this CD in the used bend it should have stayed there! The band & playing sounds good enough but the vocals are just horrible I just can't get passed that! Good old boy rock from GOD knows where?
5,Wonderful representation of the tradition!,I highly recommend this book to anyone who is sees the earth as a living sacred organic being. It explains the sacredness of the planet and why we must all work toward protecting its resources. I wish this book were still in print -I am very suprised that it is not!! It should be available for all to read. 5 stars in my book!
2,Not a CP O&M reference book,"Even for a 1999 book, it looks like old fashion, poor diagrams and pictures, equipment shown were used in the 70's. If you are looking for a detailed CP operation and maintenance reference book, this is NOT."
2,This is NOT OEM,"Should have known. It's cheap, I wouldn't recommend. Save the money get ""Denso"" real OEM. Gave 2 stars because of fair price & super fast shipping. I love Amazon."
5,Perfect,runs on the big side and you need a nine volt battery i also love the fact that when baby becomes a toddler you can weigh them standing up on the regular scale
5,Wonderful scale,I bought this scale to help keep up with my daughters growth. She was only 4 pounds 12 ounces when she came home from the hospital and it was important to me to track her weight at home. This scale is very accurate and all of the features are wonderful. I would not be without this wonderful scale at home. Every new mom should have one.
5,"Works like advertised, very happy with product","We have 10 special need cats and kittens which is what we bought this product for.It works great, just like the more expensive ones at the vet's office, works quicklyfor squirming kittens. Recommend to purchase."
3,Parts Problem,"The scale works great, but I purchased it to weigh parcels for shipment; and when I removed the tray and tried to insert the plugs, they didn't fit correctly. They kept falling out because they were too small. I contacted the company via email and I was surprised to learn that they won't just send me replacement parts. They want me to send the scale to a company in Missouri for repair, which will take four to six weeks. Not liking this at all."
3,Great except for the holes on top of the tray,"Like many reviewers, I bought this to keep track of my pet's weight. This works well except that there are holes on top of the tray which could be a trap for animal fur. Wish they had plastic plugs to put over the holes. In the meantime, masking tape will have to do."
5,Great for babies and pets!,"This scale is very sturdy, and very accurate. If I weigh my son right before I take him to the doctor, it is always within an ounce or two of their scales. This helps me monitor his weight much more closely than if I was only able to check it at the pediatrician. It has a cold, hard tray, so I keep a blanket over it for baby's comfort, and with the ""zero out"" function, this does not affect measurements at all.I also have 2 cats and a small dog that I can weigh on the scale, and it works great! the ""hold"" feature is especially useful for squirmy pets or children and it helps to get a much more accurate reading by taking an average over a few seconds.Overall this is a great scale and a great comfort for mothers like me who like to watch their baby's (or pets!) weight closely."
4,what I needed,"This scale is great. One of my kids has a lot of health issues, including weight gain. We bought this for weighing how much the baby eats, and it's exactly what we needed. Weight in pounds is accurate, but weight in grams is consistently off by 5 grams."
4,Very Good Scale,This is a very good scale. It gives the results with accuracy and it has good features. This is very handy to weigh your new born baby or infant as it displays the results quickly without having to wait for long time.
5,Very accurate product,"We bought this product to weigh our baby twice a week. We have to monitor his weight closely and were paying $25 co-pay for weight check at the doctors office every time till we found this scale. It is very accurate. We had a doctors appointment the day after we received this scale and we did weight check at the doctor's office and also when we got back home, the weight was exactly the same, even to the half ounce measurement level!! Would highly recommend this product. Since I have had it for only a few weeks so not sure about its long term performance but its working great for now!"
4,"NOT made in the USA! (Yeah, guess where?)","When shopping for a baby scale here on Amazon, I was happy (and very surprised) to find one that was made in the US.Unfortunately, it is not. The one I received was made in China. So I'm docking a star from my rating because I really dislike being misled.Disappointment about its origins aside, I do like the scale a lot. It requires a 9-volt battery (not included), and it's dead simple to use--I didn't even need to read the instructions.I use it to weigh my old, sick cats to make sure they aren't losing more weight, as well as the younger guy who needs to shed a few pounds. As far as I can tell it's accurate, and I love the ""Hold"" feature, which is incredibly convenient when dealing with squirmy critters."
4,Very good scale for my cat,"Easy to assemble, does the job. Sometimes the numbers are a little inconsistent, so you have to start over and reweigh, but overall I like the scale and would recommend it."
4,Great infant scale,Our newborn hasn't been feeding well and we've been having to go to the doctor's every 3 days for a weight check. We've saved ourselves lots of time & $$ by checking his weight at home and monitoring his growth. I love how easy it is to use the scale and that it accurate to .5 oz. This scale has definitely given us a peace of mind as we continue to monitor our baby's growth.It's also be great for weighing packages for shipping estimates!
5,Great purchase,"I purchased this baby scale for my brand new preemie granddaughter. Nurses suggested my daughter-in-law keep a log of the baby's progress. When the baby was back at the hospital for a check up, her weight on the hospital scale was identical to her weight on the scale at home. It looks like this product is a winner!"
5,Great product,This scale gives us peace of mind that our baby is thriving....plus it is fun to weight him between doctor's appts. I am glad we bought this.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,POWDER. NOT MUCH CHANCE OF GOOD ABSORPTION CO Q 10 BEST WHEN NOT CRYSTALIZED. THE BEST IS CLEAR GEL. GAVE ONE STAR AS I COULD NOT GIVE LESS DUE TO AMAZON SETTINGS
4,Excellent reading for all.,"Dear readers. I have been a minister for over sixty years and have found this book to be among the easiest to read. For young students of the Word of God this book is a must. I appreciate the author's approach with so many Scriptures to prove his points. There is no speculation to confuse the reading. I reccomend this book very highly. May God bless, your friend and brother in Christ....Ralph"
3,Understanding Revelation,"Though I may not agree with all the conclusions drawn by Mr. Litte, I appreciate his thoughtfull, consistant intrepretation of the scripture."
5,Great firewall for small company.,"Wee use these a lot for our clients. These are great. Support many features and at a reasonable price. The WIFI signal is so so, not any stronger than those cheap home grade WIFI router.For home use, I highly recommend Apple Airport Extreme, especially if you use Apple AirPlay."
3,LOUD,If you want to hear your car inside the cabin while you drive then this is the product for you.It is SO loud it becomes difficult to hold a conversation inside.
1,Decent song from a tragic album,"This song is half decent, but the follow up album is a major dissapointment, with Daniel coming across as a pretentious tryhard."
1,Biased piece of trash,It is obvious that the authors are biased against the Disney corporation and wish to force their perspective on everyone else. The money I spent to purchase this book could have been better used elsewhere. I wish i could shred the book and send the pieces back to each author. THE ONLY REASON IT RECIEVED ONE STAR IS THAT ZERO WAS NOT AN OPTION. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PURCHASING THIS PIECE OF TRASH.
3,I feel sorry for the authors.,"At first, I was going to give this book a rating of 1 or 2. But the ""Working at the Rat"" chapter saved it. It was definitely one of the most interesting chapters I've read on Disney, and was completely unlike the rest of the book. Overall, I found myself constantly wondering, why did they even bother going to Disney World? I felt sorry for them. Also, the authors seemed to be writing in a forced academic style just for the sake of it. Yes, I'm a huge Disney fan. But yes, I did agree with some of what was written. But, talk about focusing on the negative! Poor, poor, people. Lighten up, will you? I hope that next time they choose to write about something as miserable as they seem to feel. Maybe it'll help them appreciate the good things in life a little more. Ultimately, I do recommend this book based on that one great chapter."
4,Good,"For a pretty good inside look on the dirt on the Mouse's theme park in Orlando, this will open your eyes. Some good anecdotes and the publishing team kept it pretty well-balanced and moving. Given that it's so difficult to find out almost anything behind-the-scenes on this place, this book is worth a go. My perception in reading was that they made a genuine effort to be fair and objective. Respectable"
1,This Book Is Completely Agenda Driven,"Even as a very open minded person (who is a Disney fan), I find this one of the most bizarre takes on Disney that I have ever read. The research appears to be nothing more than anecdotal and Jane Kuenz is obsessed with anything that she views as supporting heterosexuality. The authors take the things that we love about Disney and try to convince you that thoses things are bad. The ""conclusions"" are not supported by legitimate research and the agenda quickly becomes an annoyance Do yourself a favor and skip this book. There are much more enjoyable ones out there."
1,Worst book on Disney I've read,"Of the 5 or 6 books I've read on the behind the scenes workings of Disney theme parks, this is the absolute worst.I have no problem with critiques of Disney but this book seem to start off with the assumption that Disney is evil and sought to support it with any facts or opinions (usually unsupported opinions).Steer clear of this one."
1,Jargon-laden,"The researchers mar their efforts in two ways. First of all, they started with an obvious anti-Disney bias and throughout the book, the reader is forced to endure their efforts to validate their prejudices.Secondly, as another reviewer has noted, the language is more than slightly problemmatical. Of course, there is nothing wrong with academic writing, but these people never eschewed the chance to use 100 words when 15 would have sufficed. The style is clearly meant to impress; it only clouds the issue. Writing clearly is an art; these reseachers don't have a clue."
1,Don't Bother,"Pompous, boring, convoluted, biased are the words that come to mind about this book. The authors seem to be angry people - not just Disney-haters, but haters in general. Some of their opinions made me laugh; the trouble is, they weren't trying to be funny. All I can say is, if these people hate Disney so much, why have they gone there umpteen-hundred times?"
2,Neurotic Academics Visit Disney,"This book is neither a ""light read"" or an informative travelogue. It is full of the type of jargon you would expect from academics presenting a paper at a conference (no offense meant, as I am married to an academic and am a journalist myself). The authors, although well meaning, get too involved in obscure references and their own personal baggage. While I did pull several good references from the book and had a few chuckles, it is simply not the type of book most Disney fans want to read."
3,Too wide.,"I bought them for my daughter for Christmas, they were too wide for my her and we had to return them."
3,"Fits great, but the toe piece hurts!","I am so excited to find flip-flops that are narrow enough to stay on my feet. Not only are they narrow enough (which is an oddity), but they also have good arch support and feel nice and cushy on the feet. The only issue is the piece that goes between the toes. It's made of a thick, rough ribbon, and it's really uncomfortable. Also, the stitching where the straps and the toe piece come together is really rough and rubs against the top of my feet. I hope I can find a way to fix that, or I don't think I'll be able to wear them."
5,A great value!,"I have these sandals in black, brown, and tan. They are extremely comfortable, easy to pair with just about any casual outfit you can think of, and definitely worth the money. I'd recommend these to anyone looking to buy a sandal that's not only comfortable, but that will go above and beyond your money's worth!"
4,Runs a little smaller,I have always loved Rainbows and these are great!!! Love the color purchased. Only thing is they run a little smaller than my Rainbows from the past. They also seem a bit more narrow than the last pair I owned.
5,Rainbow Flipflops,These are the only flip-flops I have found that have a great arch support for my sorry feet. They are extremely comfortable and well-constructed. I wear them all year long. Just wish I could get them in every color....
3,Just OK,You'd think all Rainbows are about the same. These are good sandals. But I had a problem with the fit of the left foot. The strap was way too tight. I had to put another shoe in the sandal to stretch it out for about a week just so I could put it on my foot. The right sandal was fine.
5,Love these sandals,"I love these sandals. In fact I loved them so much, I bought another pair in a different color. They molded to my feet and are really comfortable to wear. They have a lifetime guarantee on the soles, which I love. They are the perfect sandals for me since I live in Arizona and like to wear sandals year round."
2,Flip flop arch sandals,This set of shoes did not feel well when I received them and it kept feeling like I was going to fall off of them!
1,Stinky Chemical Odor,"Very comfortable but cannot get the stinky chemical odor to go away! Have tried airing on the clothesline, putting in a bag with fabric softener cloth, etc. but without success!"
5,Best Flip-Flops Ever!,Definately the best flip-flops i've ever had. The double stack makes it extra cushiony. My only advice is don't get them too wet when your breaking them in!
5,Best flip-flops ever,I absolutely love the rainbow flip-flops. The double layer makes them extra comfortable and I think they are the most comfortable flip-flops I've ever had. - ao
1,Wrong Size,I chose the women's size large and they sent me a men's large. Not clear in sizing info. I would double check with them to make sure you're ordering the right size.
4,Sturdy and comfortable,"I purchased this item because all my friends recommended it. It comes with a good warranty and is really sturdy and cushiony. The only downsides are that it might give you blisters when you first break into them and also that they will get dirty as your feet wear into them, but this is to be expected with almost any shoes."
5,Fantastic sandals - a must buy,"These are the best sandals ever. Although they are a little pricey, the quality is unbeatable and they last FOR YEARS AND YEARS. Wear them in the shower for at least a month to initially break them in, and you'll be good to go. I've lived in these for years and will continue to do so indefinitely."
4,"Great Shoes, but do NOT get them wet.","I have had two pairs of rainbows, and they are magnificent. They are the most comfortable flip-flops I have ever owned, and they match with everything. However, do not wear them in the rain, or to the pool, or to the beach etc. because if they get wet and you walk around in them they will dye the bottom of your feet orange."
2,Mam pierwsz¿ cz¿...¿¿... Kiepsko wydana...,"Tym bardziej, e sprzedawajÄ... inne egzemplae na Ukrainie! To okropiestwo, e takie wydawnictwo jeszcze popiera plagiaty Potterowskie!I mean... This publish its no good. When I read that book in Russian (I come from Poland) I was angry! Thirst book ""Garri Pottzer i filosofiskii kamen"" was publisht in Ukraina in much better paper and translate."
5,So cute!,My son loved this costume. He was so cute in it and won the costume contest with his twin sister who was in the little girl clown costume!
1,"Nice idea, poor execution","I liked the idea of a camera support that meant I didn't have to mess about adjusting the legs of an unstable pocket tripod. This 'bean bag' should mean you can simply point your camera where you want.But it just doesn't work.The casing, while durable, is far too stiif, so it springs back when you move your camera. All the advantage of the 'beans' is lost because of this.The range of angles, even if you can get it to stay in one place, is very limited.For an SLR, even with a small zoom lens, it just tips forwards. There's a version with the mount nearer the edge that might be better in this respect.Plus, it's so fiddly to get your camera onto the screw because it's big and squashy and you can't get your fingers near the screw mount.And it's so big, you'll never carry it around. A mini tripod is much more convenient.All in all, a total failure. The Gorrillapod wipes it out."
4,Found it very useful,"I found the Pod, red version, very useful so long as the tripod socket on the camera was roughly in the center of its base. I used it both on a very small and light Olympus XA2 and a quite heavy Nikon F2 for pictures at night and dusk. It can be placed on almost any surface and seems to remain stable. It will not support an SLR with a large telephone or zoom. It certainly is more convenient than carrying a tripod, even the light one which I use for travel."
5,"tripod? no, just POD!",This thing will hold your SLR or other camera practically anywhere. It doesn't take up a lot of space but it adds some weight to your gear.
1,"POD Camera Platform (Bean Bag) - Red / Black , 5"" Diameter, 2"" Thick","product does not hold up slr digital camera, useless"
4,Provides excellent protection,"I purchased this Filter case for storing 5 filters, which range from 58mm to 72mm diameter. The case fits all of them very comfortably. It is also very convenient to carry around as it fits in the belt. The cushioning is really good, and as a result this is not the one that will fit in quietly in a corner of a bag. I would any day trade in the space it consumes to the protection it provides."
4,Surprise Mom,"Being a mother of 4 daughters, one living in NY this book was a good fit. A fun book about change, misconceptions, and family. It is a very real down to earth look at life with grown children, and a mom finally taking care of her self and having some fun."
3,ABOUT 100 PAGES TOO LONG,"I am about 2/3 through this book. I want to finish reading it only because I have come this far. The book is way too lenghty and I find myself loosing interest. As I have been reaing it, I am actually skipping paragraphs! I think the book's idea of a retired mom getting a ""second chance at life"" is good, but I could do without all the wordiness of it. Like others have said, I can't believe how many run-on sentences there are in this book. At some points I begin to think the main character, Connie, may need to be checked into a mental hospital because of her obsesson with her list! Also, her list is numbered yet it jumps around. I understand shifting priorities, but who can keep track of which number belongs to what item?I am hoping for a good ending that will make the time I have invested in this book worthwhile."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"While I could relate to some of the topics she mentioned, I felt that so much of the language was over the top and it was overly dramatic on so many levels. I doubt I will ever read anything by this author again."
1,Yuck,"I read this book for a book club. Many times throughout this book I felt a vomitus uprising in my chest. It reads paragraph after paragraph of monotonous, droning drivel.This book seemed like a fun choice for an all ladies book group but it is so ultra-feminine that it ends up bieng a real turn off."
3,The Sunday List of Dreams,"The Sunday List of Dreams describes one woman's fulfillment of her list of things she wants to do one day. Facing retirement, Connie decides it is time to get started on a list that she had been working on during those long years of her life that were devoted to nursing and her family. Paralyzed with fear, she stuffs her pockets with pieces of paper on which she has written wishes she wants to work on. Once she starts taking chances to make things happen, her life becomes joyful and dreams come true. Although this is merely a fun read, it does attempt to present women's problems and challenges and give us a feeling of empowerment as Connie makes her dreams come true."
5,Nice looking formal shoe!!,"Althought it is a confortable shoe, it is not as confortable as other Bostonian shoes that I own, since this shoe is not intended for long walks. I also found it a little tight, so I will recommend purchasing a higher half number. Very nice looking and good finnishing brings this shoe an attractive look very appropriate for those formal events."
4,Otter Vs. The Tiger,"Dragon&#65533;s Gate is a great book about a Chinese boy named Otter who travels to America to fight a mountain called the Tiger....I think that this is a great book. It shows how people will put others in front of themselves to help everybody else. This book is very interesting because it shows how people where treated when they first came over to America and how employers and other Americans treated them. But the part I liked the most about this book was when Otter was hated and nobody cared what happened to him or his family and he had no friends. He kept trying and working hard and he eventually earned some people&#65533;s trust and respect. Then they worked together, and they all gained something that they all could use."
3,Pretty Darn Good,"This book was not the best historical fiction I have read, but it is up there. A list of the pros and cons from my viewpoint are as follows:Pros:- There are some very nice andmemorable metaphores, such asthe mountain's name.- Good descriptions of settings.- Relatively good draw-in; Iwas not bored reading it.- Interesting use of California/America as a metaphore, in thiscase, meaning that things are notalways as they first appear.Cons:- The parts concerning the title,'Dragon's Gate,' were unclear to me;I did not get the connections very well.- The names of the people -Spueaky andso on- may take some getting used to.- The end seemed to cut off the book tooquickly. I did not really get it, just partsof it. (there were some good parts of it, though.)Sorry, I know that the above was unclear.Hard to explain.I hope that this was helpful."
1,worst book i have ever read!,This book is officialy the most boring and worst book that i have ever read. I didnt find any part of this book exciting or good. The whole thing was boring. I had to read this book for school with a group of 5 or 6 other people. Every single person in the group hated the book. I hated this book.
3,"An OK book, not the best for this author","This is quite an adventure book, but it has crude humor and the adventure is, well, boring. The beginning got you into it, but at the end Yep slacked off. An excellent book, along with cons."
1,Bad.,"This book is very boring and has very little detail. I like historical fiction and I hated this book. If I had to write something good about it, it would be that I wa svery excited when I finished it."
4,Good or Bad?,"Dragons gate was an overall good book. It had some really important lessons, like learning to stand up for yourself, the definition of being brave, and how to fight as a team. This book is great for learning more about the history of the American railroad. I have to admit though, there were parts that were boring, but most of the parts were pretty well put together and were entertaining. This book was overall a good book."
5,"Pub Weekly: ""Butch & Marlene are the Tracey & Hepburn of the",Publishers' Weekly gave this 9th Butch Karp novel from Bob Tanenbaum a * (starred) review stating that Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi are the Tracey and Hepburn of the 90's. If you haven't read Tanenbaum yet it is time to jump on board. He's terrific.
2,irresistable impulse,the conditon of this book is less than what was stated in the write up on the info page listing.
4,IRRESISTIBLE!,"I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THIS AUTHOR AND AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED, BUT ALWAYS INTRIGUED WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT STORY LINES WHICH, ALTHOUGH ENIRELY DIFFERENT KEEP ME ON MY TOES."
3,Not one of the best legal thrillers,"The plot was interesting as well as the characters. But too long with too much detail to legal arguments, closing statements,various locations and the NY DA department. The back and forth betweem Marlene and Butch could have used a little more humor and love. The most interesting characters were Lucy and Tranh but Wolfe could have used a little more description. I admit to skimming long pages dedicated to the trial but did in summary enjoy the book."
4,Feisty and exciting,"I've read several ""Butch and Marlene"" episodes from Robert Tanebaum and enjoyed this one just like the rest. I enjoy strong female characters and male characters that are not intimidated by them, so this book fits my bill. It had a blend of street savy and corporate uptightness that blends well with each character. Following Marlene up and down the streets, trying to imagaine what's around the next turn and how she'll handle it keeps it exciting. Seeing the district attorney's office from the inside, from Butch's point of view, is a whole other aspect and totally opposite of Marlene's working world. The book is multifaceted. It varies from trying to protect the underdog, dodge bullets and bad guys all the while, make a living and raising a family. It has suspense, triumph, emotion and success, Marlene making things safer her way, Butch dong it his way. Very enjoyable read."
4,Liked it!,"Butch, Marlene et al are always fun, and leave me wanting to read more. If you want to laugh along with your mystery, this book is for you."
1,Couldnotgetintoit,"This is one of the least enjoyable of the legal thriller genre that I have read. In fact, I couldn't force myself to finish it because I never could develop any indentification with or sympathy for the main characters- they were just two people I hope to never meet."
4,superb author,"The story line is good, sometimes a little ""far out"". The best part of the book is the fantastic language, far superior to many run of the mill books of this type."
1,National Bestseller ?,"This book is good for readers with low than average IQ. Is it enough for the writer? Read the review written by Jonathan Kellerman at the begining of the book. Try to understand his esteem. It's absolutely fair. At the same time Mr. Tanenbaum has a gift to write. I would recommend him to think more about quality of his books. I have no reason to hurt the writer. I only want to tell him that his books, in my opinion, should be on higher level of intelligence. Regards, Boris"
4,Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot,I found this book to be very well writen and understandable. I think anyone wanting to understand the Thoth Tarot or Aleister Crowley will find this book to be a journey through what Aleister Crowley wanted us to understand. I give this book two thumbs up and advise anyone looking to deepen your awareness of the occult and spirituality to get the book.
3,Not That Great,"This book is mediocre. DuQuette is a governing official in the Ordo Templi Orientis. His job is to tell you what THEY think you need to know. I get the impression that he was called in to try and rehabilitate Crowley's tarnished public image. When you're done reading, you will probably like the author a helluva lot, but will not have learned that much about the true Crowley or his tarot deck. I keep a copy on hand for reference."
3,"Somewhat useful, but just okay","I am neither a devotee nor an adversary of Aleister Crowley; I just wanted to understand the Thoth Tarot. The first quarter of the book is devoted to background information about Crowley, Qabalah, etc. Some of this is useful, but could have been condensed.The author attempts to explain the changes that Crowley introduced into the Thoth deck, as compared to the Golden Dawn and other tarot decks. I appreciated this summary of the differences, which would otherwise have been confusing to me.Each card is described in some detail. While mostly useful, the descriptions were uneven, and sometimes wandered into irrelevancy. I did not need the references to the author's family or personal opinions.Overall the book is okay, but could have used stronger editing. As a reference book, its value is limited. For me, the best thing about it is that I didn't actually have to read a volume of Aleister Crowley's writing."
5,I wish this book was around 20 years ago,"Without repeating the essence of what praises prior readers left, I just want to reiterate, if there is any doubt: BUY IT! Crowley is cryptic- an understatement. But he is a profound and enlightened genius. You need a dictionary to understand him better. And the Thoth, like Duquette eloquently stated, is a pictorial representation of Crowley's life attainments, aka spiritual attainments. So if you think you don't need help, think again! BTW- for me this one plus Banzhaf's keywords, along with Thoth & Equinox are perfect together."
4,helpful,"I love the way this man writes! The book is more about understanding the meanings of Aleister Crowley in ""The Book of Thoth"" than it is about divination. It touches on Qabalah and a little divination but all around it is a pleasure to read. If you have any books by Aleister Crowley this book will make a great partner for them, and keep you from feeling like such a big dummy while you read them."
4,Excellent history of the NC Bethel Regiment,"At first glance this regimental history of the 11th Regiment North Carolina Troops looks like one just for Civil War history buffs, but that is far from the case.This history is painstakingly and thoroughly researched, and lovingly written. You feel you really get to know some of the ordinary troops involved and you connect strongly to them as the war, and their part in it, develops. The book is well-written and clear, and the battle descriptions easy-to-follow. It provides an insight into the lives of ordinary Confederate civil war soldiers, and what made them continue with their struggle until the very end.This proud regiment was involved from the first battles of the civil war until the final surrender at Appomattox - this book does credit to that proud combat record."
5,"Learned ""New"" Facts on CW","First, a disclaimer. I am biased as a decendant of an 11th NC Sergeant. So even though I give it 5 stars, objectively, one probably needs to take a star off for an obvious prejudice. However, that being said there are some aspects of the Civil War that Mr. Schapman touches on that I have not seen written as well in other Civil War books. I found that the information about how promotions got clogged up at the CSA officer level to be a ""new"" Civil War fact for me. Also, the Seige in Petersburg is often written as one monolithic event with minor paragraphs assigned to the various flanking manuveurs, attacks and counterattacks. Schapman does a detailed job in explaining these actions (or more specifically, the ones in which the 11th took part) in terms of the tactics, terrain and objectives. You really get a better sense of the Petersberg campaign in learning the details of Globe Tavern, Jones Farm, Burgess Mill and Hatcher's Run."
4,I like,"It's good help for my son . Didn't had an Algebra Book for his class , was great help for him ."
4,black metal? what are you smoking?,"I don't know why people are comparing these guys to black metal. They obviously don't know what it is. Listen to Darkthrone and Bathory - then you'll know.Deadlock is melodic death metal with some female vocals thrown in a couple spots. The male vocals are low in the mix and nothing special. From what I have said so far, you might think I don't like this cd..but I do. The songwriting is great. Bludgeoning riffs and memorable tunes."
4,Loved it!,"A sweet cinematic confection. Other reviewers have discussed plot, so no need to re-tell the story. The movie very much reminds me of ""Cannery Row""...lots of characters, and all of them big-hearted and slightly askew. I enjoyed it immensely."
3,"Good, until the end","Actually, 2.5 stars. Taking the conceit of Waiting for Guffman a little further, The Amateurs follows the misadventures of a troop of small-town losers as they take a shot at fame and fortune--by making a do-it-yourself porno film. The cast is terrific--Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson, Glenne Headly, Joe Pantoliano etc. And the group's fumbling, embarrassed efforts to recruit amateur porno actors--and film them--are oddly sweet and affecting. Of course, things go hilariously wrong at the end, but the day is saved (in a way that was predictable 20 minutes into the film). And here the movie goes entirely off the tracks with its unbelievable Hollywood ending. It would be one thing if the amateur pornographers had gotten a hint of success at the end--a spot of hope and pride. But the excessive money and success they receive shows how little the writer respected everything else about the movie that was good."
1,This Movie is HORRIBLE,Big cast. Big Names. Big pile of dung.This movie gets 5 Piles on the 'STINKY DOO DOO' meter.
4,An execellant book to have in the shop,"If you are knowledgeable about engines but not VW's this book is for you. Tom Wilson solves the mystery of what part goes to what engine. Mr.Wilson even tells you how to identify the old 36hp engines no longer used. He tells where to find part numbers what parts to replace for street use and what to replace for hard high rpm use. Terms like crank whip,counter weight, and such are explained. While aimed primarly at the street Beetle owner a valuable addition to the shop library, specialy if you are starting with a pile of parts"
5,Building a Trike,This book is very clear and uses real pictures. I find this book to be easy reading and easy to follow with its directions.
3,Pretty good,Out of date for the most part but generally good information for the VW engine rebuilder. Desperately needs updating.worth it I guess
3,vw book,"The book is ok but it could have been more specfic on each step,it jumps around too much to completly follow it right....Not real happy with it..."
3,How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen air-Cooled Engine,The How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen air-Cooled Engine was over my head.
1,Bad news to report here!,"Enthusiasts of ""The Electric Company"" like myself are not going to like hearing this, but Shout Factory has taken this DVD release and its accompanying Volume 1 off of their release schedule to concentrate on other projects!"
5,Electric Company DVD's review,I got my item quickly. It was an easy transaction and I am very pleased with my purchase.
2,Disappointed,"I requested this set based on the listing of features given before release. Be warned, the ""LY"" song on disc 2 is not the Tom Lehrer ""L-Y"" song. I wish I had waited until all the reviews were in, since that was the only thing I really wanted."
2,very disappointing!!,"I waited for this about a month when I ordered this from AMAZON and I am so disappointed. If you wanted to know about Fleetwood Mac -the early years-it's okay ,but with Buckingham-Nicks not worth it. Not even a full video of them and I am really disgusted with this dvd. The book that comes with it has alot of great words about the past songs if only the dvd would have had some or most of the songs discussed in the book, it would have been worth waiting for."
5,"Fascinating history, wonderfully written","This book captures a truly unique American product, and a family that was integral to the creation of the industry. As I write this review, Booker Noe's death was just recently announced. The personalities of the larger than life characters like Booker are wonderfully captured within the narrative. Even if you're not a fan of bourbon (philistine!), you'll come away with a great appreciation for the definitive American spirit (both the drink and the people)."
1,its not instructional,"This only a bit over 30 minutes. Its more demonstration than instruction. There is no showing how to blend, no shading, how to apply stencils with adhesive, tricks, using layer stencils or anything someone really needs to know. Wish I would not have purchased this. They only show a few tattoos on the whole dvd to put on. Yes its professionaly made, but the info sucks! Redo this thing and make it 90 minutes and really show how to do this hobby. Drop the price at least to like $5.00, then its worth it."
5,Doesn't get any better than this,I bought this after hearing a track played by Raul Campos on KCRW's Nocturna (a great show if there ever was one). I was happy to discover that it is in fact a mix. I am a huge electronica fan liking various styles. This album is just brilliant. I love it. It is so smooth and the sound is so good.
4,Never Assume...,"This is a GREAT compilation. Sadly, though, it is just a compilation, not a DJ mix, by Mr. Scruff, as I had assumed."
2,"Ok, but not comprehensive","This is an entry-level book and a quick read. I'd consider its main audience a yellow belt. It gives a high-level overview, but don't expect anything in depth. It lacks the depth for such things as design of experiements (DOE) and statistical analysis. If you purchase this book, Green and Black Belts will need an additional references to get the full picture."
2,You get the quality you pay. The system does not work smoothly,"The system does not work smoothly, it is rather hard to make it work. Then I decided to buy another one (Bogen - Manfrotto RC4) which is bigger, more reliable, and equipped with two built-in spirit levels. It is more expensive but worthy"
5,Understandable to a new business venturer,"After reading McCormick's book, being a first year business student, I had no trouble at all understanding the points made in each chapter. I thought the overviews at the end of each chapter made the vital points clear and helped me follow along with what McCormick was trying to convey to his readers.Not having too much business experience, I can say that after reading this book, business is definitely something I want to look further into."
4,Extremely valuable but often obvious insights,"If someone were to ask me to name the 10 best management books ever written I would not include this as one. However, there are certainly keen and often overlooked observations made by both the author and by Benjamin Franklin himself.I would offer that this book should be read as a supplement to other more concisely written texts. Whereas many other management books offer clear guidelines and strategies to apply to present day situations this one is more concerned with enumerating principles and then evaluating them in both colonial and modern day contexts. But the author does a very good job of not emphasizing the literal interpretation of some of the principles put forth. Rather, he states Mr. Franklin's principles and then explores scenarios that demonstrate their validity.Well worth reading just not necessarily the best."
4,Intriguing read...,"Read this book at the advice of my boss and wasn't disappointed at all...In practice and theory, very relevant to the rules of business today. I wish this was required reading in my company but one can only dream...I, for one, intend to implement some of the ideas (linking pay and performance especially) to see what kinds of results I get..."
4,great video,Larry and his brothers play great together and is very good video of the band in concert
5,Love this!,I bought this set from the Toys R Us store. It is so soft and so much brighter than the picture given. I am having a boy and loved the little ducks on this. It is VERY nice for the price. At my Toys R Us there were alot more accessories too.
2,angry,"i bought the bedding set, and lamp, but haven't been able to buy the mobile, they never have it. You really should buy another set"
4,Available at Toys R' Us,"I ordered the bedding set online after calling Babies R Us and being told it was available only online. A few weeks later I found the bedding set, mobile, and lamp at Toys R Us. I wish I could have known and saved the $15 in shipping costs. That savings would have almost bought the $19.99 lamp! I reccommend going to Toys R Us if possible because that way you can see and feel the bedding in person. Its a great value for the price but not as nice as some other sets that are available."
1,sent it back,Sent the discs 1 2 and 3 back. Not what I was looking for- didn't feel I could learn from theses discs.
4,clean cassette system,works like a deam for cheap get one gr8 investment always need it eventually never thought id use one again
3,A very useful tool,I used this product for my vehicle cassette player and it is very effective. I will also use for my house player as well due to the fact that I am old school and I still like to listen to my music any way I can get it.
1,Ripoff,"Could not get the liquid out, will not play in my car. Absolute waste of money! I should have returned it."
4,"Enjoyable book, fun read (for 23 years)","I bought this book on a whim back in 1988 in college. I often went to a bookstore to peruse ""new"" (often 1st books, or no-names) books. Bought it and enjoyed it back then. I'd re-read it in the 90's, and forgot about it when kids came along. Over the last year, I've been rebuilding my Sci-Fi collection (lost MANY books when a friend had borrowed about 100, and then suddenly moved to Texas and dropped out of contact), and just finished rereading it again.Not ""hard sci-fi"" - not much on high-tech objects (spacecraft, computers, etc), but it also makes it more timeless. In the 80's, few authors could conceive of technological leaps (Harry Harrison, in the 90's, still had his character (30,000 years in the future) look for a phone booth) -- we've achieved more by 2010 than most guessed thousands of years from now. Thus, a book like this that does not rely on tech, makes a nice read."
2,The cover and byline are more than the novel provides.,"If you like swashbuckling sci-fi, than this is the kind of novel you will like. With a lion like main character doing a samurai impersonation, the novel reads like some many other pseudo-pulp sci-fi novels.If you want some entertaining but predictable reading, and can pick it up cheap, then do it.The artwork on the cover is an early work of now world renowned cover artist Thomas Kidd."
5,"Cool, sexy, and surprisingly durable","These are a GREAT pair of sunglasses.My face is longer than it is wide and these fit my eyes perfectly. Frame is a good fit for my head too. Doesn't hug the sides at all.Quality lenses. Don't scratch easily, and my eyes don't hurt while or after wearing them.I'm not a fan of logos on my lenses but these are far in the corner and small enough that it's not so noticeable.I get tons of compliments from my girlfriends when I wear these out: the consensus being that they drip sexy.Even my guyfriends tell me that they look cool cool as hell.I've had these for almost a year now. And I am not easy on them.I wear these everywhere and put them in my coat pockets. And they have stood up to it all. The wire frames and lenses are both crazy durable. Never scratched, and never warped in the least bit.Worth every penny."
3,Great lenses but don't wear too well,"I am giving these sunglasses 4 stars because they fit my face so well and are very very light. However, the 2 star knock is due to how easy they seemed to scratch and in time the lenses become easier and easier to pop out from the plastic like wire loop that keeps them attached to the frames. You can pop them back in with a bit of effort, but in time it comes easier and easier for them to pop out. I actually liked them enough though that I had bought 3 pairs over the years. However, I don't feel like shelling out anymore for glasses that wear so poorly."
4,Bad enough to be good,"You can read my volume 1 review, same idea. But I also wanted to mention that given the time, the cartoon series is based off of the first two super mario games in terms of background music, action sequences, and enemies."
5,"Nostalgia, video game style","When I heard that this series was being brought to DVD, my heart stopped. I could not believe that this great series was coming. I got volume 1 instantly and couldn't wait for volume 2. I was not disappointed in the least bit! This is one series you have to get if you love Mario Brothers, the cartoons based on them, or just toons from your childhood."
5,Can't get enough of this kind of inspiration!,"More relevant than ever, Sam Daley-Harris shines a light on the how and why of making our democracy by, for and of the people. ""Reclaiming our Democracy"" tells the tale of a music teacher who was inspired by a report saying we have everything we need to end world hunger...except the political will. Therein begins a tremendous journey of empowering citizens which continues today and has sent ripples over the entire globe. Buy and read this book full of inspirational stories of everyday people making a huge different--you will not regret it."
3,interesting and not a good buy either,"The main advantage of this book is the fact that it is a collection of essays, which increases the readability and allows one to finish the book real quick. Further, the essays also quickly summarize some of the more common evolutionary theories of Gould and others before him, so as to act as a good 'summarizer'. It also elaborates the concept of exaptation, which seems to be a powerful thought, rich in potential.The reason for the three stars is that the writer's bias against the 'science of evolutionary psychology' comes out pretty often, and thus makes the open minded reader familiar with the subject feel as if the writer is a little close minded on this. Further, not too many original ideas here, mostly a synthesis of work done already by others - worth the synthesis thoughDont expect too much from this book, but a neat little concise summary with perhaps a maximum of few new ideas coming from it"
3,on a few peak topics in human evolution,"I read this and _becoming human_ for an online class in human evolution at barnes and noble dot com. This is an extension and elaboration of the major points in _becoming human_. Actually a little bit better given the looser construction of the essay format, so read this rather than _becoming human_. Either is a simple basic intro to human evolution with a big dose of Neanderthal history, which is tattersall's field. Short, to the point with a minimum extrapolation and speculation, recommended for a light informative afternoon spent with our closest relatives."
4,Cool Set,"Rupert Holmes has some solid stuff here.i mainly got this set for the ""Pina Colada"" song that cut is a gem.that song is still cool."
5,Life Changing,Rarely is such universal wisdom and guidance captured between book covers. This book is a must read for anyone in search of objective truth and personal relevance.
2,Mildly entertaining at best.....,"....amusingly mediocre at worst. There was nothing special about this book, nothing to really hold my attention. The author's physical descriptions of the boys in the band made it seem like several of the boys were skinny little nerds who would never in a million years be members of a wildly popular singing group. Also, his overuse of the word ""screwed"" really annoyed me. If all Mr. Zubro's books are like this, I won't be reading any more of him."
2,What was so great about this?,"I picked this book up because of the inside jacket cover made it sound so good. I started reading it on a plane and after the first couple of chapters wished my window at my window seat could open so I could chuck the book out.Three quarters of the way through the book I was not just wondering who the killer was but if the author even knew. I was only hooked because I needed to end this book. The book had a wonderful premise and some really good characters, but it seemed even the author didn't know exactly why someone would murder the members of this band, so he picked some obscure reason. The ending was rushed and out of the blue. And the reason the murderer gives as to why he killed people was really lame. No one, no matter who whacked they were, would use this as an excuse or better yet no real good detective or policeman would except the reason as truth.If you think he might like the book, you are probably right if someone else wrote it."
1,only dead egotistical morons will finish this book,"This book goes downhill from the title. Besides some amazingly convoluted, ungrammatical sentences, the actual dialogue is unbelievable, the characters are one-dimensional and the plot attenuated.I am only happy that I didn't actually buy this book."
1,No good graphic card,"I agree with the other reviewer. I have two computers, an old one that was quit powerful at the time I got it, and a brand new one that is tippical of todays middle of the road computers. This game would not load on my old computer at all. I was able to load it on my new computer only I also got as far as the other player. I want through the crack, and got just a yellow field. I could see some movement but there was no way I could play the game at this point on. Also I was never able to save the game. It would say it was saving but when I would try to load the saved game it would take me back to the opening sean. Too bad, the geaphics were great, the controls were a little differcult but I could have gotten used to that, and the story & voices seemed preity good, what little I saw of it. All I can say is good luck if you get this game, don't pay much for it."
5,Ice Age 2: the Meltdown,"My error and I opened the package, I should have read it more completely, I thought I was buying the movie, got rid of it so can't really do a review but appreciate the opportunity so am responding."
4,Wrong Description,"This is a PAL format disk, not NTSC. Be sure you can play it before ordering.Otherwise it's nice if you are a fan of Steeleye Span."
4,Love Those 90's girl groups!,"LOve,love,love real women who can really sing! I've been playing at work and in the car every since I received in the mail. I owned this cd during it's heyday and somehow,somewhere lost it. So glad I had the opportunity to restore my 90's girl group collection to it's original state via Amazon. Up next ""SWV""!"
4,90's R&B,this is an awesome cd for anyone that wants to go back and remember what times were like back in the day. The item was in very great condition and packaged well.
5,Dennis' Take,"The transaction went as smooth as possible,and I'm totally please with this seller, looking forward to doing business again in the future. Thank you"
5,So So Sweet,"This CD is too too SWEEEET! Man I love to hear these girls sing.Hey everyone, think about it. This CD had the blessing of Michael Jackson as the producer(Check out the credits). Where could these young ladies go but to the top! One other question, Where are they today? Brownstone, Please come back with MORE! We miss you!"
3,Voice from Heaven,"I truly love this CD. it has style, flavor and more. I also need some help guys. When ""I Can't Tell You Why"" was released as a single, the radio was playing a version which cannot be found on the CD Album or Casette Album. Does anyone know where I can get this CD Maxi Single or R&B Version of the song. It was GREAT!"
5,Best Show Ever On Air Safety,"Being an aviation buff, I own dozens of videotapes on air travel and air safety, this series, put on by The Learning Channel, is probably the best show ever on air safety. The quality of the production is superb, and the way the show is laid out makes for some very compelling watching.These tapes are now very rare, and going for about $80 each (not the entire set, each tape), so if you find a copy of the set, buy it. I feel very lucky that I own it."
5,Don't Miss this one,"More God Allows U-Turns gives the reader a chance to start at the beginning, middle or end... this is a book that is great from start to finish, but best when savored in small bites. READ, stop, THINK, reflect. You will not want to hurry through the excellent stories reflected here. Read one by one, by chapter or topic. The hearts of the writers speak clearly and loudly. Enjoy God's goodness and mercy in everyday situations that lead us to a closer walk with Him!"
5,Easy fix!,"Just what I needed to fix the broken arm on my Holley carburetor. The weight had broken off, so the idle would stop wherever it felt like. Sometimes at 2000, sometimes 1000, sometimes 1500. Annoying.Popped the old broken one off and replaced it with this and I was good to go."
2,didnt last a month,"purchased these and rotated with my other hose. this pair didnt even last 3 weeks. at the price thought they would have lasted longer,"
4,Th lives of the Great composers,I really like the book. The condion ws as stated and only after a couiple weeks of reading I already sound like an expert when discussing the composers. Thanks.
5,Wonderful tips and recipes,This book is so handy with so many useful tips you can implement into your life right away. I have already started doing a lot of them. The recipes are so easy and delicious. My family loves the recipes I make and they are so healthy!!
5,Works PERFECTLY!,Great product. GREAT price. Much sturdier than I expected. Looks like it will last a lifetime.
2,I wanted to like it,"I had high hopes for this product as I had used a similar one on vacation that worked great. However the one I received must have a dull blade, as it smashes the bagels instead of slicing them. If it worked properly I'd rate it highly, unfortunately the one I got didn't work and I will be returning it."
5,Best Don Moen album I have ever heard,"Don Moen is not in my list of favorite singers, however his stuff is undeniably anointed, to the point that on many songs a ""better"" singer would be a downgrade to the track. That being said, some of the tracks on this project are no short of killer. I could comment on many tracks, but I will say that as a musician and wanna be producer, ""Creator King"" is an absolute masterpiece of winds and mandolin transitioning to a chorus with guitar and Hammmond organ. Before this album, Don Moen was sometimes too bland for my taste, however this was a game changer. Projects since this one have also been very good, yet to this day I believe this has been his best. I use this album to judge my personal efforts in how to make songs and production top notch. It sets the bar VERY high."
2,quarter round plant stand,"This is a unique plant stand that is poorly made and does not hold up to outdoor weather. The pieces are metal that fit together by sliding a rod from the top piece into the piece below. The pieces do not fit tight and it wobbles. Also, the so called protective coating does not last and the connecting parts rust in a short period of time. There is no repair that can be made. It really is not worth the cost of the product plus shipping. This type of product should be made of an entirely waterproof material that would look and wear well."
3,Adventure story for children,"This book appears to have been written for children--sort of a Zane Grey adventure for kids. The story takes place in the Germany of several centuries ago. The plot is simple, and the end of the story is predictable. A quick read, and a fun read, but a simple read."
5,This id awesum,I'm from FRance and I could'nt wait until it will be available Here so I order it From USA and I am not dispointed. This is so great I love this show. If i can give you a piece of advice it will be don't hesitate and order it now!!!
3,I have to agree with the previous review,"Lewis took much too long to get to the meat of the book! It felt like the beginning of the book was totally filler. I thought this was a trilogy, so when it got to the end, I was disappointed in the ending, with all the unanswered questions. Now we have to wait until October for the next installment of the series, which seems a ridiculous amount of time. By then you'll have to re-read the previous books in the series to get what Lewis is doing. Good book though.. once I got to the end, I couldn't bear to put it down!"
5,Great.,A lady brought the first book to this series into work. I decided to read it because I was bored and had already went through all the books I had. I loved it. After I read it I thought I should find the others. So I did. I bought and read every single one and loved every minute! This is not a type of book I would normally read but im glad I did because it opened me up to a new Author and a wonderfully love story.
3,s l o w shipping,item was fine but shipping was extremely slow. i have ordered many different different books from amazon and this was by far the slowest shipping. shipping wasn't discounted either.
2,Disappointing,"This book was quite a let down. I loved the other two books in this series and was anticipating for The Sacrifice to come out. I bought the book and read it eagerly, but found it uninteresting, I felt like the author dragged the book out. I was very disappointed."
4,Great book!,"I've read the first 2 in the series so far, and finally found this one as well.The story of the Ebersol family continues in The Sacrifice. Leah is still angry and hurt at losing the love of her life to her banned sister, Sadie. She's patiently trying to cope with the loss of her mother, raise the 2 young children her mother left behind, court a man that has been in love with her from her childhood, put up with a hard-to-deal-with, grief-stricken father, and still manage to have some fun at the same time.I have to say, there is a small, but very good twist in the book at the very end and I did not see it coming at all. It totally took on a new meaning for me then.It's a must read, but I must say, if you haven't first read The Covenant and The Betrayal (in that order), then you won't really catch what's going on."
4,Fancy woman finds common bond with the Ebersol family,"When reading ""The Sacrifice"" I was struck by how easy it was to rekindle my relationship with the Ebersol family. Ms. Lewis presents her charaters fully and truthfully. Leah's love of family and sense of duty,inspite of personal feelings, inspire. Sadie's journey holds a life lesson. The twins show that even in the Plain community there is teen-age angst, peer pressure and realization that the furtue is not always so cut and dry. The struggle of Abram and Ida to hold together their family, despie the adult pressures of their life in the Plain community, will touch any parent. Remove the guies of the plain lifestyle, and you will see your own family and take comfort that there is a plan, even if we are not aware of what it is. This is a great read that anyone of any age or background will enjoy. I am looking forward to Ms. Lewis's next novel, ""The Prodigal"" due out in October 2004."
1,haven't recieved,"i ordered this book, but have yet to recieve. ordered several weeks ago. my account was charged, but no book. please credit my account.thank you.william h. brown jr."
2,Killing a dead horse...enough already!,"This book is a concatenation of rather second rate conference papers covering the unbelievably hackneyed topic of Freud's oft-reported death. Honestly, what next - ""killing Elvis""? If you enjoy books about the continual burying of Freud then read Crews or Masson - much better written. Wrong, but better written....of course much of what Freud wrote WAS bunk. Even psychoanalysts agree about that. But gosh, give him a break! He was the first one on the scene and his work has been revised by succesive generations of analysts (Winnicott, Klein, Bion etc). Perhaps the author might next try and do what Freud did; produce a model of the mind that explained psychopathology, many aspects of existential phenomena and creat a language of the mind that entered the every day lexicon. While Freud might be dead, his ideas (ego, projection, identification, libido etc, etc) most certainly are NOT!"
5,Compatibility is a plus,"A quick cost analysis (per dumbell):Ironmaster 75lb at $224.5 = $3 per pound (increments in 2.5lb) includes pedestal stand, expandable to 125lbTurbobells 60lb at $150 = $2.5 per pound (increments in 2.5lb) includes tripodlike stand, not expandableBowflex 52.5lb at $189.5 = $3.6 per pound (increments in 5lb) includes weight tray, not expandablePowerblock 60lb at $184.5 = $3.1 per pound (increments in 5lb) No stand, not expandableVersaBell 50lb at $131.5 = $2.63 per pound (increments in 10lb) includes weight tray, not expandableOne major advantage of Ironmaster is that it has 1-inch holes which will fit standard 1-inch threaded weight bars including the spin-lock ez-curl bars. So you can easily turn dumbells into barbells."
5,Well worth it,"I'd like to direct people to BlackSCRunner's 4 star review (though I rate them a 5).Having used these dumbbells for over a year now, I wholeheartedly agree with most of his observations.The Ironmaster's aren't the dumbbell of choice if one absolutely needs speed in weight selection even though one can change the weights fairly quickly. But they make up for it in solid durability. They feel awesome and solid. Just don't drop them or you'll damage the floor.Ideally it would be great to have both Ironmaster and Powerbloc. Having said that, I also have a set of ordinary adjustable and small fixed weights so drop sets with dumbbells aren't an issue. The majority of my training incorporates pre-ex, 4X and Time under Tension anyway.The important thing is to ask oneself - what will the major part of my training protocol consist of?The Ironmasters are solid units that will last a life time.PS The 120 lb add-on accessory is great value as well!"
5,Excellent dumbbell set that saves space,"I have had these dumbbells for 6 months now and they are fabulous. I really like the small footprint they take, the solid, secure feel they have, the ease of adjusting them, and that I can use them like real dumbbells if I want to hold on to the side for tricept exercises. The screws lock the plates in very well, they don't take long to adjust, and feel like normal dumbbells. I looked at several of the adjustable weight systems and this just had the right price and quality match. Plus you can use these weights in their kettlebells as well. The black paint can chip if you bump one against another, but I am not seeing any rusting or other issues with that beyond some very minimal paint chip on a few plates. Their products are very good quality and I am mindful of them when I look to expand my home gym."
4,"Good product, but be aware of the cheaper alternatives","These are great adjustable dumbbells. The ONLY disadvantage is the relatively slow change time compared to something like Powerblock, but that's well known and can be weighed (don't mind the pun!) against the advantages of solid construction, feel and the free stand.However the videos on the site are a bit misleading. And I think IM's are not THAT much better than cheap spinlocks with regular plates. They are faster to change but not that much faster, its the same basic principle with the fancy Quicklock system.If you have the money go for it. But a lot of people get seduced by the idea of adjustables, esp the crappy Bowflex Selecttech. Then they find out about the real alternatives - Ironmaster and Powerblock. And all this time they aren't even aware of the cheap as dirt spinlocks. You can buy handles and weight plates as and when you need them, even used plates. They are just as solid as the IM's."
1,Swiveling Back Scrubber,"I rarely write bad reviews as I generally like the things I buy. This Back Scrubber was a huge mistake. The swiveling head (which I thought would be a good thing) was just aggravating. It would not lie flat while I was trying to wash my back. Instead,it kept turning. The curved handle also made it difficult to get the sponge head to lay flat on my back. It wasn't just me, either. My husband had the same problems with it. Finally, after less than a week of use the head just broke off. Mayby it would work for someone else, but for us it just didn't. I replaced it with a regular long handled back brush and am much happier."
3,Pleasant mix of country rock tracks with an easy delivery,"Most of the tracks on this CD wouldn't be too out of place on albums by more established country stars. Delivery and style is pleasant but possibly lack the crack and emotion of somebody like George Strait (but then he has had a lot of practice). The 'cover' tracks are probably the poorest ones on the CD in my opinion, but these do not detract from the overall feeling. My favourites: the rocky ""Something to think about"" and the really great ""If I never stop loving you"" which goes wonderfully with the linedance ""Cinqo de Mayo""."
1,chucky cheese teeth,"Who does this chucky cheese tooth boy think he is? The album is nothing but cookie-cutting pretty boy stuff you might here on Sesame Street. Not to insult that program of course, but this album is for kids. But I wouldn't want to let my kids listen to this phony playing Metallica songs. This guy is a true fake. He totally degrades Willie Nelson's ""Four Walls"". Save your money and buy something a little better, like Billy Ray's new one."
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY MUSIC INDUSTRY????,"STOP THE INSANITY!!!!!!!!! TAKE THIS KIDDY OFF COUNTRY RADIO!!!!!!!!! THERE'S A NEW GROUP CALLED ""SPRINGER!"", THAT RULE!!!!!!!!! He's NEAL MCCOY/DAVID LEE ROTH wannabe!!!!!"
3,Very Enjoyable,"Kersh's 2nd album is an improvement over his first album (which was not bad, but not great either). He has a smooth credible voice and has picked songs like ""The Need"" and ""If I Never Stopped Loving You"" which are great to listen to. His version of ""Wonderful Tonight"" does not compare to Clapton's, but if you can get past that it's nice to listen to. This is an album that I like to listen to when I want to relax -- a nice job. I'm waiting for his third.Let me say also (after reading some of the other reviews) that Kersh is a great live act. Unlike many other artists, he really can sing. He also is very country -- yes, he has a rock encore that mixes Metallica (briefly), Lynyrd Skynyrd, and a few others, but his main set is country and very fun. Kersh has the potential to be a very big star. I can't wait to see that happen."
2,Not impressed,"The quality was very good -- but this was not at all what I expected. I thought it would be more like a mini bundt cake, but instead it's just like a cupcake -- that looks just a bit better."
5,Love this pan!,I got this pan to make mini pumpkins for my sons' birthdays at school instead of the usual cupcake. They came out great!
5,Love this product,I am really enjoyed this product. Very glad I bought it. It is durable and well made. I highly recommend it.
1,"Poorly written, rife with typos.","I was actually amazed that this book got published! Aside from the massive number of typographical errors, it was meandering, constantly bringing up new names of stars with absolutely no context, dropping them, then mentioning them again 100 pages later. A poor book that manages to make an interesting subject boring."
3,Trashy but fun,"I liked the book. It was trashy but really fun. It says on the back of the book that ""Nobody wanted to know (about the lesbianism of these stars)"", but I did."
1,An Unfortunate Telling,"The subject is one of great interest, but the book is so poorly written it's annoying. The author cannot keep to the theme - often within a paragraph. The book is little more (if more!) than an ""outing"" of a lot of dead people who are no longer around to defend themselves. What might (and should) be a fascinating story will (hopefully!) one day be told by someone with more ability."
1,One of the Worst Books Ever Published!!,"This is one of the most ridiculous and certainly dishonest books you will ever come across. The author offers no real solid proof to any of his claims that most of these women were lesbians, just a ""rumor"" seems to satisfy him as evidence. A truthful book on this subject is much needed, but this ain't it!! One that is heavily researched, I might add, and tries to confirm the information (amazingly, the author does not suggest any rumors on any particular stars are false!) I suspect about half of the women mentioned here were (this includes those who were really bisexual although the writer suggests that virtually all of them are hardcore dykes) and half of them weren't which is very bad odds for a nonfiction book."
3,Every Girl Should Have a Mercedes,"I am grateful to this book for bringing to readers' attention the fascinating and sadly forgotten Mercedes de Acosta. It is troubling that so many reviewers have raised questions about the validity of this book's claims, and its 'style' when clearly the business of writing interpretations of the past is to do just that - interpret. To infest this subject with queer theory jargon would be to kill it outright. Authors and historians of whatever stripe are entitled to their own 'take' on situations, and some are better than others at interpreting 'between the lines'. Thankfully, times have so changed that the book's 'accusations' are less likely to do the damage they clearly would have during the performers' lives. I found this book, though scattered, very illuminating, and I would be interested to see reviewers come up with evidence to support their own criticisms."
2,Annoying!,"This is one of those gossipy hollywood books claiming everyone is a homosexual. This book doesn't stay on topic long enough to tell a story!! Every other word is ""Mercedes De Acosta""-- I think that the author of the book should have wrote a bio on her life, rather then a bio claiming to be about a bunch of people, when in reality the main part of the book is about Mercedes!"
5,A MUCH NEEDED BOOK FOR YOUNG LGBTQ YOUTH!,"The information in this book is pretty accurate. I do a lot of autobiographical and biographical reading, and there is an exceptional amount of overlap from this book to my other books. Personally, I believe, EVERYONE should read this book. Knowledge is power! All children, especially LGBTQ youth, should read this book. It would have meant the world to me to have had this book to read as a teenager."
4,""" 2 Much is never enough""","This was the first piece of STT music I ever owned.I caught them performing ""Hit liquor"" iive on MTV's 120minute'sand was blown away! (How about that crazy video)? Anyway,purchased the c.d.about 10 yrs. ago. Mindblowing!!!! It was fresh and different. I loved all except the last track.I wanted more so I purchased their previous album's. Too much of this band is never enough!!!"
4,"not quite perfect, but mostly excellent","I didn't pay much attention to this record when it came out, thinking Shudder was just one more in the parade of post-Nirvana indie bands cleaning up their sound for easy radio assimilation. I remember ""X-French Tee Shirt"" was the single, but in hindsight, I think it should've been track three, ""9 Fingers on You."" Of course it is my least favorite song. The fact that most of the sub-par tracks appear at the beginning is my biggest gripe. If they had made track three a B-side or released it as the single, I may have given it 5 stars. Regardless, this record has some of the greatest math-rock on any major label release, not to mention ace vocals and attitude to spare. The second half (side two for us vinyl geeks) is flawless. Get Your Goat has a lot more punk power and earnestness, but at this writing I couldn't see not owning a copy of this one."
5,Shudder to Think's best work ever!,This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Each song combines raw power and melody in a way no other group can.
1,"Rush fans, rejoice!","If you like your rock music droning and soulless, with odd-timed guitar riffs, nonsensical lyrics and songs that overall lack in tight structure, climax and clear point, then by all means pick this album up. But if you want something enduring and versatile that moves you in any way, then RUN! You won't find it on here."
3,"not bad: decent weight, bearings, great price","i picked these up because i wanted some SPD-style pedals for my bike without spending a lot of money. i had a gift certificate and i didn't want to blow it. overall, these are performing ok: clearly they work, and the cost is great. the bearings are a bit stiff (they could rotate a lot more freely) and the weight is OK (ie much more expensive ones will weigh a lot less), but overall if you want a simple SPD-style pedal, these will be great.no need to buy extra clips, either, these come with a set (as expected). i'm using mine with a specialized taho shoe, a nice combo."
3,Theatre Fan,"This is a nice archival interview with Michael Price at the Goodspeed Opera House in 1977 after ""Annie"" had just won the Tony Award for Best Musical. The interview only lasts about 15 minutes, so this is a little pricey for what you are getting, but if you are a fan of the Goodspeed Opera House, you may enjoy it. The show they are working on is Jerome Kern's ""Sweet Adeline"" and you see clips of the rehearsal and a little of the performance as well as backstage discussions between Michael Price and the choreographer Dan Siretta. Unfortuntely, there are no clips of ""Annie"", but you do see Michael Price's passion for theatre and why the Goodspeed Opera house has been a fixture in East Haddam, CT for so long. This is really for the true old-style musical theatre fans."
3,Just ok,"VERY LOUD!!! Decent price, but doesn't cool as much as we hoped for, and it's loud even on the lowest fan setting."
1,Diluted!,"I have been wearing Alien for more than a year now. I absolutely love this fragrance on me, and it is so potent that i only need to spray once in the morning and it last all day. When I close to running out of my last bottle, I decided to purchase a new bottle off Amazon. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING! From the first time I applied from this new bottle I knew something was wrong. The key notes were faint, there was a heavy alcoholic air to it, and it didn't last. I knew right away it had been diluted with alcohol. I have reported this to Amazon, as they were the seller, and fortunately they were, because I was offered a replacement or a refund. I'm not sure the process would have been as smooth with other suppliers. Please note, fluids are considered hazardous materials and are not returnable."
4,Alien By Thierry Mugler For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 1 Ounces,Wife likes fragrance. That is all that matters.Service from provider was excellent. Arrived in time.Would reorder products from this supplier.
1,Bad Advertising,I bought this CD assuming that the original artists were performing these songs. THEY ARE NOT. What a disappointment. I got it today and am returning it today.
4,"Very, very funny.","If you don't know, this is a comedy cd. I've seen Jim Gaffigan on ""Conan O'Brien"" and ""Letterman"" numerous times, and he always cracked me up. His topics are great, but his delivery is just as good, which is very important. ""The Last Supper"" deals with two things mostly: Food and Jesus. I guess the majority is on food, everything from eating out and dealing with waiters, to a deep discussion involving ""Hot Pockets"". His religious material is really funny as well, as long as you aren't touchy to the subject. I guess there's two things you actually need to know about this disc, it's so funny I sometimes cry when I listen to it, and you can get it at ""www.JimGaffigan.com"". I also highly recommend getting the latest from ""Mitch Hedberg""."
2,love the series....but this is a dud,I really enjoyed the Nathan Heller series. This is a dud. I just couldn't finish it.It's just too fantastic.More of a bad romance novel.
2,"plot -8, execution -2","It was a sorry day when the courts disallowed slander of the dead, it opened the doors for some to trash the famous dead. Mr. Collins takes this to a new low and it wasn't necessary sine the general story is quite good without the trash. Signet should get some older editors, ie a 1935-6 Hudson with ""park"" in it's trans. a 30's ex-cop using his father's 9mm, I don't think so- maybe if he was a German cop, but not Chicago."
5,Wonderful!,"This book, like the whole HeartQuest series, is great! You get to pick everything that happens and as a young girl I loved that. The writing and plots are magical and romantic , which are my favorites. If they're yours too, buy this book and the rest of the series."
5,a comfortable cow,"these are great. not much ""shedding"" ive had these before- and no complaints about them either. I get invited to all the cool parties once people see my cool seat covers. These seat covers don't exploit minorities or make sexist comments. Even jedi knights WISH they could have seat covers this cool. I wouldnt even trade them for a sno-cone."
4,Nice enough,"What can you expect for the price? They cover the seat well and adjust to various size seats. However you might want to wash them first. The amount of ""fur"" that comes off on my clothes astounds me."
5,Excellent,"This album is nice. These guys are talented and definitely didn't the promotion they deserved, but the overall album is good."
2,Horrible sound!,"Yes,this is 'early' Conway Twitty, and yes, 3 his big hits from this period are here (Mona Lisa,It's Only Make Believe & Danny Boy) but the sound on this cd is very bad. It's so cheap, almost like the real audio here on amazon. And every song has a 1-2 seconds fade in. Sad."
2,Mostly sappy doo-wop...,"I was looking for Twitty's early rockabilly sides, because I heard he had a rockabilly past before coming a ""big haired"" country ballad singer, who taled his way thru songs. Well these sides aren't horrible, but only several of the tracls qualify as rockabilly, but most of it is throwaway doo-wop stuff which is really dated sounding. The highlight is a swingin' rockabilly version of ""Mona Lisa"", and several others that sound like they could have made him a rockabilly star. I regret purchasing this cd, and do not recomend it. By the way Twitty is unrecognizable on this cd, if you are used to his hits, he's actually a decent singer here, it's just too much sappy dated doo-wop and not enough rockabilly, if this were all rockabilly I'd give it 4 stars."
1,"BE WARNED: Despite what the product information says, there are no subtitles on this DVD","Although the information given on for the box set claims that there are English subtitles, the DVD itself has none. The publisher claims it is because of a ""packaging error"", although I personally have my doubts. Anyways, the lack of something as basic as English subtitles on an anime DVD set is simply inexcusable, and misrepresenting that lack is just wrong. I would heartily advise against buying this DVD."
3,Sailing Schooners on the Pacific Coast,"This is one of the major sources for the ""mast and a half"" sailing schooners that first sailed into the dog-hole ports on the Redwood Coast Other sources for the lumber ships are ""Pacific Coast Lumber Ships,"" ""Ships of the Redwood Coast,"" and "". . . It Is a Dangerous-looking Place: Sailing Days on the Redwood Coast."""
5,The Doghole Schooners,"Am interested in California shipping history. This book has been out of print for a while, so was overjoyed to find I could buy it through Amazon. It is very well documented and easy to follow."
5,The Best Treats for our Cats,"These are our cats' favorite treats. We use them to ""bribe"" our cats so we can trim their claws. We have tried a few other treats before, but after awhile they don't care about being bribed and actually have become afraid of the other treats because to them it means it's nail clipping time. Not so with these treats - they put up with our nail trimming, and then they get very excited, and even pushy, to find the treats afterward. They get so excited they grab at our hands to find more too. We love them!"
1,No treat for my cats,Neither of my cats would touch these -- even my dog wouldn't eat them. A total waste of money at least for my pets.
5,The Best Flavor Zone Bar,"I've tried many fo the flavors Zone makes for these bars, and by far the Peanut Butter is the best. I could eat them every day and they satisfy my hunger longer that a granola bar. They are small and light if you need to pack something for a trip or hike. I highly recommend them."
5,Recommended!,"The chocolate mint is exceptional. ^_^ The bar's texture is a bit monotonous but as far as protein bars go, it will fill you up and keep you going! A+!"
2,Aside From the Nice Art.. Pass on this collection.,"I would think that Ross would show some respect to the 1980 recordings from Chipmunk Punk, and Chipmunk Rock? Nope...He Re-recorded ""Lets Go"" and even cut off the bit where Simon and Theodore convince Alvin to put on a wig to sing ""Leader of the Pack"" and that he could be the leader. He even edited out Billy Ray Cyrus speaking parts on ""Achy Breaky Heart...""Since he did that and backed out on reissueing older LPs, I feel that some of that magic is gone... It is too bad because I really like the chupmunks, but not the chop shop job on this album... For those that have the Lps will know what I mean"
1,The most boring program out there!,"After reading all the hype on the T-Tapp program I couldn't wait to begin. I bought the book, 2 DVD's, and 2 VHS tapes. I began to do the boot camp that the book and DVD's recommend. After a week I was absolutely bored out of my mind! Also, as a seasoned exerciser I found this program way to easy. If you are new to exercise you MIGHT be able to get some useful information out of T-Tapp. Otherwise avoid this."
2,No index,The book explains some of the principles in the tapes so that makes it helpful. There is no index which makes it difficult to use. The evidence mostly anecdotal.
4,Decent book,I bought the book as I had bought 2 of the workout dvds about 3 years ago but never really used them. I figured I'd give it another try and see what information the book might have to offer. I did the 14 day bootcamp and then did the basic plus workout everyday for another 14 days as well as sometimes doing the entire workout listed in the book. I only lost 1.5 inches in my waist. Not two dress sizes like the book promotes. I went on to the t-tapp website and posted my discouragement. Some of the instructors wrote back with some helpful hints and support. The workout helps my back feel better but I wouldn't buy it in order to lose two dress sizes because it probably won't happen.
5,Fitness Review,"I love this fitness book. I love Mrs. Tapps creative, yet deep approach to getting in shape.I've tried different exercise routines. I've worked out in gyms, done yoga, tai chi, tae kwon do, and karate.This regimen by far is the best. I have been doing the first half of the routine faithfully for four weeks now, and I've noticed real results. The exercises are easy, yet deep in their impact.Mrs. Tapp brings her extensive knowledge, life experiences and encouraging personality to this workout regimen. She has a dedication and passion for what she does, and it's expressed in this book!!"
4,I need to see it in motion,"The book, in combination with the try it before you buy it portion on t-tapp.com have helped me understand the movements and the concepts very well. I definitely need to buy the dvd, though - thankfully there's a 30% off coupon in the back of the book.I like the series of exercises because it focuses on rehabilitating and balancing the body - which leads to weight loss and muscle gain, instead of the other way around - focusing on losing weight and not necessarily on balancing the body to avoid injury.It would have been 5 stars if the dvd showed all of the exercises in the book."
1,Nothing new or special,"Yes, I have tried T-Tapp and it is nothing new or special-it's isometric exercise which has been around for years. It is a hard work out and it evolves around a lot of MLM. The videos and the instruction on them are really just teasers to get you involved in the forums, buying overpriced supplements, like alfalfa, the expense of buying more videos and attending very expensive weekend seminars.The majority of these reviews are written by T-Tapp forum members, many of whom were solicited to ""testify."" Any system of diet or exercise will produce results if done consistently. This method is neither new or different."
1,don't waste your time and money,"The book is so confusing and complicated. It will take me hours, maybe days, to read all the instructions for each move and learn the sequence. I have read many exercise books and this one is so awful. You really need the DVD for the Total Workout. The DVD costs $80 on her website. So ridiculously expensive! Plus, I don't understand how her exercises could be aerobic by doing some knee/leg lifts at a moderate pace and strength training (bone-building) without lifting any weights. Please don't waste your time and money on this book."
2,Difficult to learn exercise from a book,I thought the idea behind it was interesting but the techniques are fairly complex and hard to learn from a book. A CD of the full exercise regimine would be better.
1,TOO Hard to follow.,The exercise in this book were too hard to follow. it's hard to look at the book and try the exercises at the same time. Not user friendly at all.
3,so frustrated!!!!!,"I""ve got the book on the weekend, and it is very difficult to do the exercises, they have so many steps, and so much information that you get lost before to start the exercise.I been doing exercise all my life, I am an intermediate/advanced, but this is too complicated. I'll buy the videos and I'll see how they are. Don't buy the book, it's too expensive, go for the videos."
5,Hope and directions for the unfit of the world!,This book gives easy to follow instructions showing exactly how to do the exercises designed to create a healthier smaller body. I am not a health nut and never - but never - exercised just to be exercising because most of the exercise programs promised big results and only created sore muscles. This book gives you exactly what it promises. I've lost inches and I haven't experienced any major soreness! At the age of 69 I thought it was too late but this book gave me hope with a practical and simple program to get the job done. Each exercise is detailed with pictures that take you from the beginning through the exercise and gives you the exact way to hold your body. If you are fed up with hours working out and getting no where - check this out!
2,good text -- illustrations are difficult to follow,"Fit and Fabulous is an easy-to-read book, but not an easy-to-follow one. The illustrations are at times confusing, as they more often illustrate poor postures rather the correct postures. It would appear that the author assumes that everyone is working at the same level of familiarity with the program. However, the argument of strengthening your core makes a lot of sense; hence, I decided to purchase the video to help me understand the moves better. The video was very helpful, though at times, the camera is not necessarily in sinc with what the trainer is trying to demonstrate.In sum, aside from the illustrations, I found the text informative and useful. Ms. Tapp's story is inspiring."
5,15 minutes is all you need,"I have transformed myself from a size 18 (tight) to a size 12. I look awesome compared to when I was a size 12 before. I have muscles. This book is awesome. Not only do we get to know Teresa better, we get to fully understand the workout.Buy this book, you will only wish you found out about T-Tapp sooner."
5,Informative,"With this book and Theresa's website, I am learning how to do her exercises. The book is a good start for learning and also a good reference."
2,Forget About Fit and Fabulous,"Wish I hadn't wasted the money. Workouts are acutely precise in form with sometimes 20 steps to one workout and another two per step to explain how not to hold your foot, your leg, your knee, your shoulder, your hands, etc. Just not practical to try to do these without a hands on instructor."
2,can get all the info on the website...,"I bought the book today and was super excited about it. Well...after flipping through the book it seems that they just took all the information off of the t-tapp website and put it in book form. Even the testimonials are all from the website it seems. Seriously, some of the things may be new, but most of it you can get for FREE off of the t-tapp website."
5,Great Hydro-Pack for AM bike riders,"Planty of room fpr nearly anything before and after the ride, while minimizig its size on the ride. Gloves, Helmet (!), cell - all have enough room. Sperated into 3 local folders, you can also find your stuff easily.For a highly reasonalbe price ($49.99) in amazon, it's a highly recommended stuff."
2,Great game if you are a racing engineer or professional driver.,"Great graphics, but the in game options really made the experience weak. The arcade version (the only level I could even begin to handle)was still quite difficult in terms of driving physics (simulator mode being nearly impossible), and had very limited play options, i.e. not allowing a race against a full field of cars. WHY NOT??? That's lame!Since I don't have hundreds of hours to study racing like an engineer, and even more hundreds of hours to spend playing a stupid game, I much prefer the arcade like action of the Need for Speed series. If you are accustomed to that type of game play, DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,beware of Starforce copy protection,"Do an online search and learn about the intrusive and obnoxious Starforce copy protection before you risk installing this game on your PC. It installs drivers, without asking or telling you, which will not be removed when you uninstall. Apparently us normal people who legitimately buy our games are just ""collateral damage"" in the war against pirates. I'll repeat: search online and learn about it for yourself, or find out the hard way later."
4,"With some updates and added tracks, not too bad!","GTR was the talk of the sim racing world prior to release, and I have to say it is a lot of fun. There are now new cars and tracks to download from the net, my favorites are Adelaide, Laguna Seca, and Mugello, and last but not least the Nordshleife at the Nurburgring, the best track any sim can contain. Over all a good job and thums up."
4,exellent racing game,"I love the graphics and assortment of cars. Especially the morgan aero-8 team!That being said, this game screams out for a real steering wheel and pedal controller as opposed to keyboard controls, something I did not clearly recognize until after purchasing it. This is an oversight I intend to rectify."
5,Amazing!,"I've owned almost every racing simulator there is over the years, but this one takes the cake. Amazing graphics compared to other games, and they nailed GT car physics dead on. If you like this one, try GTR2 its just gets better."
5,Excellent Sim,"Great simulation of the FIA Gt Series. Fantastic physics. Has a very realistic feel to it. A hard core sim racer ""must have""."
1,GTR FIA GT racing game,i received a defective product and havent received a refund. what happened. this was a christmas gift. how long does it take to refund or replace????? unsatisfied
1,Windows XP x64,"I run Windows XP x64, and did not know that GTR FIA GT Racing Game was incompatible with the operating system. The newly released GT Legends (released 02/06/06) and the soon to release GTR 2 (releasing summer of '06) will run on 64-bit operating systems."
3,Haven't played it personally but....,I got it for my niece and nephew. They've given the game rave reviews - as has their parents!!
4,Entertaining and fun; not plausible and not supposed to be,"I enjoyed this book; found it both ironic and funny and fell in love with the two aged Icelandic characters who narrate the story. It tells the little-known story of the ill-fated Scandinavian settlements in North America in the 11th century very well. I didn't give it five stars because I honestly doubt that this is a book that will stick with me much after a year -- but it's good, light summer reading."
2,Very Disappointing Book,It was all I could do to get through this book. One of the biggest wastes of book money I have made in quite awhile. Not recommended.
4,Black Powder Compendium,"The author (S. Fadala) is a recognized expert in the area of black powder shooting sports. The manual is well planned, referenced and provides a progressive experience in the use and feeding of black powder firearms. All areas of loading and shooting are represented in the manual. However, as might be expected, emphasis is placed on the rifle and pistol loads. Unfortunately, this does not carry over to the muzzle loading shotgun(s). This is an area that requires further work and shooters in this discipline might feel slighted."
1,NOT entry level!,"How incredibly frustrating. This camera arrived with several POUNDS of instruction manuals. These were poorly translated (from Japanese I guess) and often referred to stuff that was in the illustration, but not on my camera. I wanted to rip my hair out. After reading and reading and studying and studying, I still could not operate any more than the automatic mode, and never did figure out how to switch between menus. I bought this based on the reviews here that it is a good entry level digital camera...for WHO?? An engineer? An experienced photographer? Let me be the first to say I am not technologically inclined, but HELLO, I thought entry level meant entry level--just entering the realm of digital. I am still so lost. And frustrated. I have signed up for classes to learn to use the thing. A complete exercise in frustration. Never again."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this camera because of the Canon brand name. But I was totally disappointed.The camera has good image, but some unforgivable problems:- You need to install tons of software components just for tranfering the pictures from the camera to the PC.- The ZoomBrowser EX software does whatever it wants, except what I want to do. Opens picture folders that I don't want. And keeps spreading the pictures all over my HD.- I need to unplug my other 3 USB devices everytime I want to transfer pictures from the camera to my PC. Because it won't work if other devices are connected. This is even stated in the camera's manual.(...)"
1,Didn't work,I need the camera for work. The camera didn't work and I lost clients due to the fax I could not take picture. The camera had to be format. I thought you put the disk in and just use it.
2,Complicated,"Took it on a trip, couldn't figure out how to work it, bought a disposable that worked just fine."
1,Very Disappointed,This was such a nice little camera & easy to learn. But requires downloading more stupid software to a Mac that has an OSX operating system. I have 9.2 & no plans to update in the near future. All I need is to plug into the OSB port & have the folder pop up on my desktop with JPGs inside. I don't even know if this camera creates JPGs or raw data??? The manual doesn't say.When will the tech people get the message that we're tired of all this updating & problems with incompatability...
4,"Awesome for the price! Excellent camera for a first-timer, maybe even 2nd timer","This camera has great features and functionality, is a breeze to use in terms of learning it (as my wife can attest to... although it may take some time), and it's so simple to transfer files/print to a canon printer. I purchased this with the Pixma ip4200 printer, and it was well worth it!The only downside I'd point out, which was a real bummer for my wife and I and is the reason I only gave 4 stars is that the flash is very slow to bounce back (so-to-speak). I recently got her a new 7.x MP Canon Powershot SD1000, which is similarly a snap-and-go camera, and the flash is a bit quicker at rejuvenating. However for the money, this drawback is truly minor, unless you're planning to really take tons of quick photos... and even then, I believe with these cameras you can set 3 shots at a time (although you should double check)."
4,good camera,"i haven't used the camera a lot...but when i have it has worked out just fine. my ""old"" digital camera is just that...old. i have had it for over 10 years. although it is much larger than my ""new"" camera - i have to admit i am more comfortable using it. the old camera doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the new one --- that is something that is hard for me to get used to. but the canon a410 is a really good camera for a fairly low price. i am happy with my purchase."
5,Great buy! Not a single blurry picture!!!,"I bought Canon S2IS for myself and A410 for our niece. To my great surprise A410 took A WHOLE LOT BETTER pics than S2IS. (In fact I sadly returned my S2IS and continued using my old faithful Canon PRO 90IS digital camera.) We took several pictures with it, not a single came out bad! All were vivid and crisp. I just loved this camera's output. Only one thing I didn't like is the zoom controls are on the back on the same dial as forward backward controls. I like zoom controls on top of the camera."
5,Canon Powershot Digital Camera,The camera was well packaged and the delivery was prompt; exactly the day it was promised.
3,Camera Review,"This camera takes good pictures but the only problem with it is that it goes through batteries very quickly. I got some rechargable ones and they last a little longer, but it's a bit of a hassle always changing batteries."
5,Canon A410,"My first Canon A410 was a great little camera. I took pictures all the time: of grandchildren, flowers, birds, turtles, etc. when it no longer took the best pictures, I told my husband I wanted a new A410 so I looked on Amazon. There it was. It is every bit as good as my first one. I can download the pictures from the SD card to my computer and then burn them to a CD. It is a great little camera to keep in your purse like I do."
5,Good Battery!,This battery has outperformed the specifications initially quoted for operational time. Good product.
1,Very Disappointing,"I've read scores of computer books, including quite a few from the ""Teach Yourself..."" series, and can honestly say this is one of the most poorly written books of them all. I'm six chapters in and can't say I've learned anything more than what I've already gleaned from other books' brief explanations of the subject. A great deal of the book is occupied by what can only be described as ""filler"" examples, which are both redundant and useless at the same time.I shall attempt to find an alternate piece of work, forthwith.This is not the book for someone seeking to learn XML."
5,I like it,"This is the perfect filter holder for me. I have 4-67mm and 4-77mm filters. It holds them well and the slots are see-through so it's easy to find the one I want to use. My previous filter holder was all black so I couldn't see the filters.This is made for large filters, not small ones. Someone complained that his small filters fall out. If you have small filters, get a small filter holder.Someone complained that the filter holder is too large for the camera bag. It has a handle so you don't have to put it inside your bag. Fully loaded, mine is 9"" wide x 4 1/4"" high x 2"" deep. I put mine where a laptop computer is supposed to go. I use a Tamrac Evolution 8 backpack.Someone complained that there aren't enough compartments. Well, it comes with 8 like it says. If you have 9 filters, screw two filters together.Someone wrote that the bottom compartments are magnetized. I didn't read anywhere that Tamrac had a magnetized holder. Mine is not magnetized.Suggestion: Read all reviews before you buy."
3,Snug but works,"This product is to hold filter collections, it specifically show color filters which is what I bought it for. It holds four well, but to get all eight in I have to play with it a bit."
4,I really like this filter holder,"I like this wallet, but, alas, like everything, it has its drawback (really just one for me): you have to carefully pack this case, otherwise it doesn't comfortably close - you get an unpleasant ""bulge."". It concerns me when this happens, so I usually re-pack it, and then it's fine. I am probably a little easier to please than some, so if you know that you're a little bit ""retentive,"" then go ahead and try it but be prepared to return it. For me, it packs my 8 filters of varying sizes (55mm - 72mm) just fine."
4,"Could use 4 more pockets, I am greedy.","a Must have. Because, I often send my bag sliding downhill so I can climb down without falling, I found this item to do an excellent job of protecting my filters. Not one damaged filter in 3 years."
4,"Great thriller, and a fast read","I enjoyed this book very much, and finished it of in 2 sessions. Whether you are interested in medical stuff or not, you will enjoy the author's simple ways of explaining somplex-sounding topics.A quick read and a great thriller, this book has a totally unexpected ending that will make you appreciate the nicely woven plot."
4,Great Medical Mystery,I'm always looking for good medical mysteries...I love Robin Cook books especially. This is a great page-turner-- I highly recommend Soul Survivor. I look forward to reading more from this new author.
2,Poor graphics and elementary strategy,"The maps are poorly drawn and hard to follow. It tells how tocomplete the missions, but lacks multiplayer tactics beyond thebasics."
4,Good Purchase,"Product as described, good quality & fast shipping. Looks great with my costume. Hat is slightly shallow, so might not work for big head/hair."
3,Pirate Hat,"At first I felt the hat looked rather ""pimp"" like, but EVERYONE loved it and it has been borrowed for many a costume party."
4,lovely watch,"Could not have asked for more. Really worth the money. If I have a critisim, it would be that the strap is a little flimsy. Thats a minor thing - buy yourself one - its great looking"
5,Buy this now.,"I bought this used here on Amazon for $5 and I almost want to send Mr. Barker a check, I feel like I stole it. If you like his illustrations you'll like this book. Barker is obscenely talented, no question about it. WELL worth $20 or so for a new copy, don't hesitate, buy it."
3,Great art. Terrible book construction.,"I jumped at the opportunity to have a collection of Clive Barker's art. Sadly, when the book arrived I was immediately disappointed. Not at the art but at the construction of the book itself. Almost every page was stuck together because of the gold paint applied to the edges. I shipped the book back and quickly recieved another copy (Kudos to Amazon for the quick turnaround). Imagine my suprise when the second book had exactly the same problem. Rather than continue the order/recieve/return process indefinately I just carefully pulled the pages apart as best I could. None of the art was really affected but the edges of most of the pages were marred. Leave it to some fly-by-night publishing house to ruin what would otherwise be an amazing collection of art from one of Horror's finest authors."
2,"Good book, lousy binding","The book itself was what I was hoping for. It was a gift for my son who is a Clive Barker fan and had heard about his art. But whoever bound the book did a pretty bad job. Most of the pages were stuck together along the edge, we had to be very careful turning pages so that they didn't rip."
4,Nice book but terrible binding,"The images in the book are very to look at they range from beautiful landscapes and villages to horrible looking beasts and monsters. Because of the large number of images with nudity and sex in them this isn't something to get for kids who enjoy the ""Abarat"" series or ""The Thief of Always."" The binding is really bad about one out of every five pages is stuck to another page, my big complaint with the binding is that two of the page were stuck together in the middle where the pages meet, as a result the pictures on both pages have huge white spots on them. I still recommend getting this if you like Barker, but if a different binding comes out in the future you should get that one instead."
2,Mediocre Video,"I thought it might be better to learn by seeing, but a good book would be better than this. I did learn some pointers, so it has value, but is not a must have item. Jimmy should have insisted on more strategies and concepts from his guests.Seems as if it was rushed to be put together without a lot of planning.If you have the time and money and you are a beginner or approaching an intermediate level this maybe something to consider.. or not.."
3,would like better if the waist belt were a clip instead,I don't like the way that the harness secures at the waist. I've only had it for a short time. Sometimes it's uncomfortable when I am belaying another climber.
4,"Light, economical, great alpine harness","I was able to wear this harness with a full winter pack up Mt. Whitney. I used it a bit on the chute for practice, but have not had a true fall yet. I like the quick release and the weight. I am a bit concerned though that in a fall, my nuts might get squished and render me impotent, but hey.. guess I run that risk with any harness."
5,Goodby hot flashes,"Soy Care really works! I used to have hot flashes all through the day and night but since I have been taking soy care, I rarely have them. I'm so glad I found this product!"
5,I loved this book...,"I loved The Lights of Tenth Street. I couldn't put it down, I was even up until 2:30am reading it one night to finish it.The book was such a blessing to me, I could feel the spirit of God when I was reading it. I even cried a couple of times.I think that God has blessed Shaunti Feldahn to be a very gifted writer, I pray that He will bless her abundantly for writing books that are an encouragement to me. I recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense and books with a spiritual depth."
5,Amazing work of literature!,"Shaunti Feldhahn is an author I hadn't read before, and as usual, I was not sure I wanted to try yet another author and be disappointed with some story without depth! Man, was I pleasantly surprised to find not only depth, but the topics that were intertwined in this book are so relevant in today's fallen world!Shaunti tackles topics of disobedience, shame, lust, forgiveness, faith and 'plastic church people'... all things that most people face day to day! and the Spiritual battles that ensue each and every moment are brought to life in her written view.... the constant struggle between the demons of this world and God's army of angels.I look forward to more of her books!"
5,Every Christian man should read,"I've read another book by Shaunti Feldhahn named ""The Veritas Conflict"" and I knew I had to read ""The Lights of Tenth Street"". Shaunti really captures the struggle of mens lust for woman and the state of pornography in this day and age which is so readily available. I could easily relate with the males in this book and the battles they were facing. Their trust in God made them triumphant in their daily battle with lust. I await more similar titles from Shaunti."
5,ELOISE!,"I've been reading Eloise since I was 6 and I'm now 14! She represents freedom, and her wildness refreshes my mind. It's a great book for kids and it will expand their imagination."
1,Not an Eloise fan...,My daughter received this as gift from her Aunt(an Eloise fan) for her 6th birthday. I found it to be confusing. I would not pick this for a child. Not my idea of a childrens book.
2,Eloise Book,"I am a loyal lover of all the Eloise books, which is why I was so disappointed with this book. This book is made up of parts from the original Eloise and Eloise in Paris. There is nothing new in this book and I was really disappointed with it."
3,Confusing guide to Eloise's life,"This book seemed confusing to me. I've tried to read it to my six year old nieces several times and neither of them cares for the book. The illustrations and accompanying prose are nothing special. If you like Eloise, stick with the full length books."
2,"Another compilation book, nothing new","I love ELOISE (the original books), but this was just a repackaged book of quotes from the original books."
2,Content is general and not very California specific.,The book is confusing and not complete. It contains a lot of general information and leaves a lot of researching up to the reader to find out about the specific laws of California. The publisher offers to sell several products - one of which is a corporate seal -- which is not needed in California.
5,Fantastic Arrangements & Performance,"I ran into this while looking at Allen Vizzutti CDs, and I'm very glad I did! These tracks are all very well done. All of the arrangements were wonderfully done. They each brought new life to each of the songs. Rhapsody in Blue is one of those songs you've all heard, but when you hear this arrangement it's like hearing it all for the first time! It's a great compilation and I highly recommend it!"
1,Too Much Piano and Not Enough Damrau,"My wife and I were extemely disappointed in this CD as we love Diana and have several of her CD's and DVD's. But this is a lousy recording of her voice as it's completely overridden by a very loud and noisy piano. We listened to every song and it was the same througout the CD. The microphone was either too close to the piano or none was close enough to Diana. This CD recording is an embarrassment to her ability and beautiful voice. It's a piano recital, not a Damrau recital. If you like Diana, then take a pass on this CD."
3,Okay.,The hangers are good quality but short. Skirts would hang better on the hanger if the hangers were longer. Most people don't have 20-inch waists anymore
4,Just what I was looking for.,"The material that these hangers are made from is durable. I like that they can hook on each other. I tried to find them in my local big box store but, couldn't find them. Unfortunately, after purchasing them online I found them at Bed Bath & Beyond for half the price. I will purchase them in the store next time because the quality was the same."
5,Great Skirt Hangers,"I wear a lot of suits, and it is such a pain to hang up because I hate those hanger lines! These hangers don't wrinkle my suits and they take up less space then my other hangers did, so that means I get to buy more clothes! I bought 3 packs and just switched all my hangers for these new ones and I am glad I did."
4,Good quality vertical skirt storage,"I use these to sort my skirts by color, with the shortest ones on the bottom. They handle quite a bit of weight with no trouble, and have so far held up very well."
3,Listen to Read The Hits.,"I think I can safely say this must be the 400th 80's collection out there. Hey, choices are good right. Like any collection of this sort, the more songs you like on it, the better it is. I would call a dozen of these awesome, the other dozen not so. My favorites are from 'Til Tuesday, Blue Oyster Cult, The Romantics, Adam Ant, and The Outfield. Many others are good too, but then there's the ones we've heard way too many times also. I'd say give it a shot if it has that song you've been looking for, or if it's a few bucks used."
3,An intriguing mixture,of great songs and songs that really suck. It's hard to imagine anyone who likes anything from the 80's that won'f find something to love and hate here.
3,Horrific story,"This was such a horrible story of Palestinian parents who murdered there daughter. They called it all in the name of Honor for she was becoming to American. What it's called is murder. The story was not written very well though. The author was all over the place and did not keep the story in one place.The show forensic files has an episode on this. It gets to the point with out traveling all over the place as the book did.If your curious about the story wait for it to come on forensic files or look it up on line. There is tons of information on line about this tragic story of the lovely , kind innocent girl who did not deserve to die."
1,Not a worthwhile product and could be dangerous,"the product did not stay together as the holes were poorly drilled and the parts did not stay. Moreover, even if one were able to put the frame together, if a dog were to kick after urinating, it could dislodge the frame. If a dog were to step on one of the dislodged ends, the metal connector sticks would stick up and could smack the dog or actually stab it.

5,Enjoyable Read,"Well, I have to start by saying that Mr. Pack was my grade school art teacher, my high school English teacher and one of my best friend's dad. All that aside, it is a gosh darn good book. Clyde is a skilled writer and his imagery is wonderful. The book gives a good picture of the period in Eastern Kentucky (based on what I've heard about that time from others) without being campy or stark. Ready for the pop quiz now, Mr. Pack."
2,Not true to size or width.,These shoes just didn't work for me. They were very narrow in the toe area and just didn't feel comfortable. They slipped on my heel when I walked but appeared to be the correct size as far as where my toe came in the shoe. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone. They were rather clunky looking on my feet and a really poor fit. I threw them out.
3,Could go into deeper details,"Although their advices and examples are very intriguing, I doubt this book alone will be of much practical use for the everyday psychologist. This book seems like an appetizer and leaves you waiting for the real dish. It looks like the authors wanted to share their (good) ideas, but did not have the time or intent to create a structured and complete method.Would I recommend it? Yes, with a word of caution about the brevity of the material (and the price tag is more compatible with a thicker volume)."
2,Too little information; very small book for the price!,"For the price I figured I would get at least 200 pages of great interventions, not so. I got 165 pages (more or less) of stories, and humane philosophies about the chronically mentally ill. The key points found at the end of the chapter would be droll to the seasoned (over one year) therapist. It's an okay reader for the truly green. Authors could have done a much better job. Insight oriented therapy is extremely limited in this population, but was everywhere throughout the book.For someone looking for new and profound interventions and deeper thoughts, save your eighty some bucks for a couple of different therapy planners, or an on-line solution oriented course. Very disappointed in the content and the slim amount of reading. The steep and unfounded price left it with 2 stars."
4,Mandie's back at school,"I liked this Mandie book better than the previous three (numbers 21, 22, 23).Mandie is finally starting to get back in her element!The new school year is just beginning and Mandie is already getting blamed for things she didn't do. Troubles begin when she finds a leaking jar of molasses in her bag. Everything worsens though, as someone is definitely trying to make Mandie look bad and get into trouble with the head mistress.To top it off however, Mandie has other problems on her mind, like the potential buyers of her school! She knows she won't like them and many of the other girls at school feel the same way.There's another thing eating at Mandie's brain..Where has her grandmother disappeared to without telling anyone?I did like reading this story, and I hope the books that are next in line will be just as good."
5,The Best Study of Evolution I've Read.,"Wallace takes on evolution (and the way we were taught about it) the way Annie Dillard lifted the veil over nature in ""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek"": you are forced to replace the myths with a newer, even more mysterious understanding. Ironically, the theory of Sasquatch is retold as common-sensical, scientific fact. The steelhead trout, in fact, comes across as the greater nystery!I count this book among my all-time favorites, a sort of heir apparent to ""Walden."""
5,One of the best wilderness books ever,"Wallace is first an explorer, then a writer. He explores the wild places of the Kalamath Mountains, from the ""wonder of dreams"" of the upper canyons of the Chetco River, to the scrubby peaks of the Siskiyou and fits it all together in a fasinating evolutionary story. I have explored many of these same areas and found this work to best capture that feeling of being in truely wild places. Read it, then go explore!"
5,70s music,"This product is great! It is especially wonderful for anyone who loves the music of the 70s & 80s such as Ricky Nelson and ""Garden Party.""Wonderful collection!"
5,OFTEN OVERLOOKED,RICK NELSON MADE QUITE AN IMPACT ON MUSIC AND HIS LEGACY IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED.THIS CD HAS SO MANY GOOD SONGS FROM A TRUE ROCK AND ROLL LEGEND.TIMELESS.
1,Worst dictionary ever,This dictionary is exceptionally hard to use. Thank goodness for smart phone dictionaries. this phone makes not sense to use. It was even difficult to use if I followed the instructions. On top of that it was slow.
1,Rather weak and superficial,"I am surprised by the high ratings of the previous reports, for I found the book to be very superficial. The main point of the book is that authenticity means to take control of your decisions, but it does not provide any real help about how to achieve this goal. The discussion is very naive and useless if you really have a problem. It may be of some use if you a strong believer, since the author builds a lot on christian values."
1,Scientist?,"This man addressed to me the filthiest racist insult I ever heard from a colleague or former colleague at the University of Southampton. Ask him about it. Today, he would be liable for criminal prosecution for that comment. I would be the first to call the police in."
4,Needs to be on every shelf,This has been an excellent reference book for myself and my colleagues in a busy Derm practice.There is no way to learn it all or see and this reference comes in very handy when you get a tough case.It is a bit expensive but this seems to be the nature of anything that is sold to doctors.
4,Fantatstic presentation of common dermatologic problems,"This is a wonderfully written and beautifully illustrated text of the common clinical dermatologic diseases, well discussed regarding diagnosis and management. The only criticism from this dermatopathologist is the lack of inclusion of the rarer dermatoses (some of which are not all that rare and of quite some significance, e.g. Langerhan's cell histiocytoses). However, such an inclusion would likely make the text too long and distract from actually reading and enjoying the book as it should be. After all, other more specialized texts are always available for reference. Finally, the writing is a pleasure to read and the photographs superlative. This book should be enjoyed by all who have any interest in dermatology."
5,One of our top favourite Christmas albums,"Not only do the boys choir sing beautifully, the mix of old and newer music, vocal and orchestral, makes this tasteful and varied two-disc celebration one that we have never tired of in 20 years. At Christmas 2021 my 83-year-old neighbor bought copies for all her children."
4,GARRISON Delivers Remarkable Twist,"GARRISON was made for a micro budget by a first-time filmmaker who is an army veteran. The director maximized his meager resources and delivers what I think is one of the most remarkable twists in cinematic history. Kerry Valderrama is clearly filled with talent and much potential, and any technical and casting deficiencies should be forgiven in light of a $4k production. If you let the movie play to the end, you will get a shock that will leave you in chills because of the horror. By the way, Mr. Valderrama was a Nicholl's Semifinalist this year. Sponsored by the organization who gives out the Academy Award, the Nicholl is considered the most prestigious screenwriting award worldwide."
1,"I'm not a kid, i was too lazy to sign in","This series is absolute garbage. The characters are very generic and the special attacks that they use get tiring and lame. The Kenyo monsters that are in this movie are terrible and this would have been a better series without such heinous monstrosities. This series reminded me of a combination between One Piece, Samurai X(minus the good anime), and naruto. And for as much as this costs I was P.O.ed after i took the risk of buying it. DO NOT BUY THIS SERIES OR EVEN WATCH THIS SERIES. THE INTRO SONG TO THE ANIME SUCKS AS WELL!!"
2,disappointment,Any Fan of the original Samurai Deeper Kyo Manga will be greatly disappointed in the anime. The plot line is way off and Frankly is just a basic Shonen plot. The plot of the manga is indefinately better and the characters arent as believeable in the anime. SO if anyone who read the manga is looking to buy this Dont!!!!!!
2,Samurai Deeper Kyo,"Samurai Deeper Kyo is a well crafted story hampered by uninspired characters, boring fight scenes, and too many cheap animation tricks (recycled footage, sections where the only thing that moves is the character's lips, etc.). The only redeeming feature is that the series is broken up into several tightly scripted lesser story arcs instead of being one long, dragging story."
1,I got the lemon,"My 14 year old son was happy with the bike at first, and does not ride his bike ""hard"". My older son remarked on the frame welds being sloppy and not ground down. Within 2 weeks a pedal broke(plastic), the sprocket is warped and the bearing in the rear hub is shot and he can't pedal it until we put more money into it and get it repaired. To replace what's broken it will cost us another $85.00 (on the low side). My son is not happy now - nor am I."
1,Worthless,The concept of this highlighter is great. I highlight a lot while reading and I do a lot of reading on public transportation. Taking the cap on and off is annoying. I retractable high liter is a really convenient thing. Unfortunately i have not found one that lasts more than a week. This particular one is the worst that I have tried. It went dry after the first time I used it.
5,"Si existe una referencia a la amistad, está en este libro!","La amistad de dos hermanas, la compañía de otra mujer, el amor filial, que va más allá de las fronteras, relatado magníficamente por Manuel Puig, a través de la correspondencia de dos mujeres mayores. El amor infinito que se trasluce a través de la distancia hace que nuestro corazón sea parte de esas cartas que se envían una a otra."
5,ANother Best From London,"Dag is the hidden legend. If you like Paul Oakenfold and Sasha from Global Underground, get Dag. I'd guess he ranges from 130bpm to 160bpm. He's fast and trancy butwith hard sweet bass to keep you awake and bounc'n. In this one he follows the tribal theme nicely.If paul is #1 Dag should be second."
3,Why Nothing New?,"An interview, trivia, pics, any special features would have been nice, but rehasing the same old stuff is not. On another note though if they did add new features to these dvds it would make die-hard sex and the city fans have to buy these again. So maybe its a catch-22."
1,Sex and the City - Best of Mr. Big,Big disappointment! Three episodes wasn't much. What can I say? Don't buy it! Gail Leavitt
4,Holiday Decorating,I was very pleased with the Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Salad Plates. They look even better than I imagined in my china cabinet. Can't wait to use them and have all my friends/family see the beautiful display. I'm going to keep them out through February since the design is basically Winter and not just Christmas. Amazon's price was better than anywhere else I shopped and I got them quicker than originally expected.
2,he ruined himself,Hi my name is Mike Sanlin and i taught chris clugston a system i invented called combat jkd. He put it out on video which i approved of but then he later came out with a video called comhrac bas. Ever since he did that i have not spoken to him. Its the worst thing ever he teaches some of my moves like the pop up and the wedge but then he does some stupid moves like the tossed salad i eman you have got to be kidding me. He was an ok student but wasn't anything special. Comhrac bas is not what it claims to be. It will get you killed. I feel sorry for hi i don't know why he left a great system like combat jkd for some stupid fake historical grabeg like comhrac bas. My opinion is don't buy it its rubbish if yu wnat something fromm clugston get the combat jkd tape as he teaches my stuff thats why. Don't wasste your money.
3,"Adopt what is useful, reject what is useless,...","...add, what is specically your own! There's some good information here,...techniques and training drills. It's not the end-all, be-all, do-all,...unbeatable fighting system!!! Any claims of a fighting system based on the ancient principles of a vanished sub-culture(Roman Gladiators),...needs to be analyzed with a critical eye & mind. That said, Chris Clugston's tape series can help you as a modern day martial artist and fighter. He's obviously bled, and shed blood on the street. With a discerning eye, the ""good stuff"" here, shines like a diamond ..., on these tapes. I think they're worth adding to your collection."
2,Good and bad,"Some good stuff but, where is the basis for saying that these techniques come from Gladiator days??? What do cape buffalos (in South Africa) have to do with Roman Gladiators??? Why is the system called Comrac Bas (Keltic) and not Gladiator Stuff (Italian)??? As for the techniques demonstated, they are ok, but there is no cohesiveness. I would not particularly recommend these to anyone, they should spend their money elsewhere."
4,Fun to play!,"I enjoyed playing this game. It was clumsy at first, but you made adjustment to it well sooner than you'd like to think. The original Deus Ex was better, but it's still good. I give it one star less, because it's somewhat short game."
3,Anywhere There's an Upscale Hotel Boutique Chain ...,"There's nothing very Tokyo about this CD other than the CD cover. It's solid boutique chain hotel lobby/bar background music ... or perhaps a nice score to a indie movie about a character frequenting hip upscale Western bars in Tokyo.It's pleasant, solid, professional chillout and pop trip hop ... but naming it Tokyo Lounge is very misleading. It could easily be called Milan Lounge, Moscow lounge or Los Angeles Lounge but I suppose Tokyo Lounge sounds so much exotic and compelling ... this nothing extraordinary or even anything remotely exotic about this CD, it's nice, it's pleasant ... it's an evening with colleagues you don't know at a boutique hotel lobby bar ... you're gonna toss back a few but you're not going to unloosen the tie ... and then call it a night :-)"
2,Is Sport Sync only an urban toy?,"For the price, its not a bad radio but I'm thinking it was designed with urban signal strengths and cable or broadcast HD delays in mind. I am at the edge of good radio reception and am on a satellite TV system. Consequently, this little radio doesn't always produce a clear audio output and, even with the full 8 second delay, I still have a lag between the announced play and its appearance on my TV screen. To be a useful radio for the rural sports fan, it needs a better antenna, tuner, and rf amp section and at least a 10 second maximum delay. Its better than nothing here in the Colorado outback, but still far from what I was hoping to get."
1,Not enough delay,I saw the disclaimer that said that there may not be enough delay in some instances. This gave me pause but I decided to roll the dice and give it a try. Well I lost.... I have HD with DirecTV and have yet to find an instance where there is enough delay on this unit to over come the delay in the TV broadcast. If I could get about 5 to 8 more seconds delay I think it would work. Beware if you receive your TV broadcasts from satellite you most likely will not be able to overcome the delay in the TV broadcast with this unit which will make the sync feature worthless so in effect you end up with an expensive and very mediocre portable AM/FM radio.
1,Piece of crap,"Radio broke right after warranty period ended. Way over priced for the quality of the product. Save your money, don't buy it."
5,"Great opening, Wonderful comedy, It's That Girl!","My review from Season One is basically the same for Two and Three. My only question is why Bonnie Scott and Dabny Coleman left the show after season one. I thought they were great. You do see more of Bernie Kopell in season 2 as he and his wife become Ann's neighbours. All in all a great collection... worthy, a piece of American Pop Culture.I will repeat my complaint from the first DVD... why no subtitling? Beyond that, it's top drawer."
5,A Great Classic,"I cannot wait for the second DVD, this was the best, watching ""That Girl"" today was like watching ""That Girl"" in the past, thanks for the opportunity to relive the good ole years.Heres hoping the second DVD will be arriving soon."
4,Good mixes!,"The mixes for this song are quite hard to come by on CD (the vinyl is plentiful and contains an additional remix not found on the CD) so if you can find a used copy of this, I suggest you snap it up right quick."
5,A review of the system our Liberals want for us,"Harry does an excellent job of exposing what it's like to live inside a Socialist system. I say Socialist because there is almost no difference between Socialist and Communist, as evidenced in the writings of Marx, Stalin, and Mao (who all used these words interchangeably). Harry had a small taste of freedom through his father when he was young. As freedom evaporated all around him and his family, he began the long march into work camp incarceration and governmental abuse. Harry had the guts to fight back against a system that suppresses any idea of individual freedom. This is an excellent primer for those who wonder what life would be like should American Leftists get the 'Change' they are clamoring for."
3,Good Bag but Strap Needs Work,I have owned this bag for about a year and wanted to share my experience with it. Here are the pros and cons of this bag:Pros:-Good design inside for storage and for day trips.-One of the best looking bags I have seen-The flip around design works fairly well-Good build qualityCons:-The sling system does not work very well for me. The strap tends to rise up my chest over time until it is rubbing against the base of my neck. This happens with or without the waist strap secured. I am constantly having to adjust the bag or hold the strap as I walk. This spoils the bag for me.I would not purchase this bag again and will be more careful about sling bags in the future.
2,Well built but clumsy to use.,"I've had this bag about 6 months. It is well built but clumsy to use. All weight is on one shoulder. when shoulder strap is adjusted out to access camera as a side or front bag you a have to readjust to use waist strap in back pack position. Top speed flap is held down with 3 quick-release buckles, not so speedy. Front pocket could use expander pleats and a longer zipper for better access. Not mush room for battery charger and chord."
4,Great bag at a great price,"This is my second tamrac camera bag and I have no major complaints. The only reason why I did not give five stars is because I have seen a newer version of this same bag that zippers and think that would be a better buy than three clips. I am able to reach around the clips to grab my small lenses, which is great, but then I think of all the dust and insects that can do the same. Very cormfortable to wear all day loaded with two Canon Rebel bodies and three heavy sigma lenses!!!"
1,It is not flexible and it hurts my back,"With a simple load (D70, 17-35mm, 35-70mm, a flash), the bag cannot be swung around easily. There is no flexibility advantage. And yet, the bag does not provide sufficient support. My back hurts at the end of the day because the bag has only strap and thus thus load is not distributed evenly, skewing it to one side. In my trip, my daughter and I eventually took turns to carry the bag. She complained too and she is no wimp -- a captain in her water polo team in high school."
3,Velocity it's not,"The following equipment will fit into the main compartment:- one Canon 5D body with attached Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM and lens hood- one Canon XT body with attached Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM and reversed lens hoodThe following equipment will fit into the outer compartment:- one Canon Speedlite 580EX and smaller necessitiesWith the bag rotated towards the front of my 6 foot 185 pound frame, there's always this fear of dropping a camera while struggling to remove it from the main compartment.Instead, I have to unbuckle the waist belt, remove the bag from my body in order to easily remove a camera from the compartment. A slow process which defeats the purpose of this so-called ""Velocity"" design.I returned the bag for a full refund and am still waiting for the right sling bag."
3,A little disappointed,"I Own several Tamtac products. The quality of constuction, materials, and durability are excellent. It swings around conveniently, as advertised, and contents are easy to reach...if they're at the top of the bag! Anything below the top level is a bit of a chore to retrieve. The very bottom isn't of much use, except for storage...unless you have an unusually long lens attached to your camera (my largest is a 70-300mm zoom). Also, the sling tends to bind at the neck, making it somewhat uncomfortable when fully loaded. Overall, a good product, but could use some refinement."
2,Ramalama (Lame Lame),"Figuratively speaking, take twelve cats, tie their tails together along with lots of tin cans then string this mess around Yoko Ono's neck while she ""sings"" - that would be music, this is not. Pity, too, because the talent of all concerned is obvious, it's just wasted on this garbage."
2,Meh...,"Well Moloko had a few hits, nothing mind-blowing or genre-busting. But I won't compare this CD to Roisin's previous collaborations because that would be unfair. Unfortunately me being completely objective doesn't help this album any...There are some interesting and zany tracks such as ""The night of the dancing flame"" ""Ruby Blue"" and ""Ramalama"" but are they worth coming back to the next week? afraid not. I like it funky but it seems Roisin just can't deliver....it reeks of mediocrity."
4,Cures That Sinking Feeling,"I hated this album the first time I listened to it. I really did. Totally didn't understand it and was expecting accessible pop gems like ""Sing It Back."" Or maybe that first day I just wasn't in the mood to listen to an incredible piece of pop art like RUBY BLUE. Because it is amazing. Roisin's voice is flawless and Herbert pushes the concept of music with bizarre arrangements and creative sounds. The only weak spot on this album is the very last song-- I haven't even taken the time to remember what the name of it is. But it's boring and it just doesn't hit me. But the rest of the album is perfect to put on when you're laying by the pool on a hot summer day-- or just laying anywhere. I'm looking forward to what Roisin has to offer in the future. I just hope some US record exec gets wise and they start releasing her albums over here."
5,Genius.,"Roisin Murphy is the most talented artist of the 21st century. Much more than Bjork, Tori Amos, bla bla.. Roisin is IT. Too bad she hasn't made it as big as she should have. But she has a new album and single due out soon, SO CHECK IT OUT! Overpowered, released July 9."
3,CD - Dr. Jean's Kiss Your Brain,"I have this CD, and ordered two for my two preinterns. They will like having the songs that they learned to sing with Kindergarten to use in their classrooms!"
5,Best tool for my first year teaching!,I have been struggling all year with music for my preschoolers since I am not a very musical person myself. Dr. Jean has been a life safer! My students love all her songs and are always eager to sing them. I don't know how I have made it through half a year without her CD's. I would recommend them to all early elementary teachers!
4,From high school to now,"Great sounds of Joe Pope, I saw them live in the 50's,the recording is first class,some of the other artist's songs don't do much for me but that was the England tour,all of their big hits are here.They represent a period in time that is dear to my heart."
5,"Hey Girl, Don't Bother Me: The Best of the Tams","Hey Girl, Don't Bother Me: The Best of the Tams...I have always loved the Tams...had all of the songs I love dancing to."
2,Sorry I bought it,"I was looking for a book that might give me some strategies, also more on rules of tournament play or hoyles rules. I found it lacking in all areas."
2,More of a pamphlet than a book,"I bought this to give as a gift. Very disappointed when it arrived to see that it's more of a pamphlet than a book, and a very cheaply assembled one at that. The page ends don't line up, the cover is one step above construction paper, and the the page edges are sharp.I give it two stars because the content might redeem it. As for the presentation, I'm embarrassed to give this as a gift and will have to find something else."
5,Wow - Bumppo is the Master of Euchre!,"I wish I could give The Columbus Book of Euchre 10 stars. It is fantastic. I learned so much from the Legend of Euchre, Natty Bumppo. He is wonderful. Sure knows the game. I wish I could meet him in person.The Columbus Book of Euchre is perfect. I did not find one mistake. Everything you would ever want to know about this wonderful card game. Beautifully written, not one ounce of fat.The best $13 you will ever spend. This book is incredible!Get your copy soon, and learn from the greatest Euchre player who has ever lived. Soemday, they will name a street after after him. For now, we will worship Mr. Bumppo with awe and reverence."
5,More laughs than a card book should have.,I was expecting a very boring read. Instead I found myself laughing out loud. The people used to describe the game were memorable. A must read for all card game lovers.
4,A good book.,I would recommend this book. A good book to study the bible and learn more about God's word.Your knownlegde would be improved about the bible.
4,well written enjoyable story,"The conclusion in the Wilde trilogy, Ace's story was not, in my opinion, the best of the three (though he is certainly the most charming brother!), but it was highly enjoyable. The sparks and feuds between Ace and Ally only serve to heat things up, and for those who were waiting for Ace to finally meet his match in a woman, you won't be disappointed. The characters in the Wilde trilogy are rich and full of life...Ally and her cantankerous grandfather, the newcomers in this book, personify the characterization standards we have come to expect from Ms. Langan by the end of this trilogy. Though my personal favorite is Chance, I would swoon for any of these three brothers."
3,"Could have been much better, but it has a unique ""feel""","Sometimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction, especially the epilogue. Perhaps it is because it is based on such strange facts that it resists being fictionalized. ""Stealing Sinatra"" registers as flat. What a waste. I think that its biggest problem is it neglects to include some of the more interesting facts of the story. Why did Barry Keenan do it? The movie shows him popping pills but it does not mention (if memory serves) that he was once a great mind and the youngest person to trade on the stock exchange. It does mention his maraculous rebound in the end, but does not mention that kidnapper and kidnapee are often forced to exchange awkward glances at ritzy parties. All and all it is an adequate film, due mostly to the way it evokes its time period, and of course the remarkable skill of William H. Macy."
2,Boring as boring can be,"Ugh. Don't waste your time. You may think this is a ""movie"", but it's just something Showtime threw together. None of the acting is very good, and it has very little, if any, redeeming qualities.I know, I know, it has ""Sinatra"" in the title, how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me.The only thing I liked about it, assuming they stuck to facts, is that you learn what happened to Frank Jr's captors."
3,Not great for air travel,"Strap connectors busted on first use walking through the airport. Scuffed up significantly after bag was checked. I would recommend this product for car use, but not for airline travel."
1,Medial History from the Soviet Academy of Science,"Well, the book is about medial lives and customs of folks that are usually not present on the pages of history. But if you read it, it looks like a long runt against the Catholic church with references to New Testament, analysis of contradictions in the scripture etc etc. I do agree that Church had black pages is the past. And that the life of peasants revolved around the Church and religion. Yet, performing the linguistic comparative analysis of St John vs some other is a piece of biblical exegesis and pointing inconsistencies in the doctrine is rather the stuff for theological discussions, not the book about peasants' customs and mores. So, what this book is about? About what the title claims or a runt against the Church? The fact that the author is a celebrated scholar from the Soviet Academy of Science could shed some light on this question. These folks seem to be particularly qualified to pass a moral and doctrinal judgement on others."
2,Not what I expected...,"I could not get into this book. Yes, it was about sex, sexuality, and the sexual nature but there was something missing. There were almost too much story and not enough erotica. When I get a book specifically for EROTICA that is what I want. That is not what I got with this book.The sex scenes were too few and too far between. Maybe I'll check out some other books by Phoenix but this one was not a good start."
1,On a not very Deweyan Dewey,"This book shows it readers what John Dewey would be like if he were an analytic philosopher rather than a pragmatist. Talisse's Dewey is not the real, historical Dewey, but instead a prop set up to engage certain more recent issues in terms of categories and concerns foreign to Dewey's own work. Some of what the author says is interesting enough, but it serves as an introduction to Talisse, not Dewey. Persons wanting illuminating introductions and overviews of Dewey's philosophy should turn instead to those by, for example, Bernstein, Boisvert, Campbell, Stuhr (available in audiotape also), and Westbrook."
1,Dewey without context,"This book indeed is short and simple. The problem is that it is too simple--i.e., simplifying--and that it treats Dewey out of context and pretends that Dewey was somehow engaged in the kinds of things that now occupy professional philosophers who study so-called deliberative democracy, worry about neutrality and communitarianism, and believe they are constructing logically compelling arguments. This book does not really grasp Dewey's central understanding of the nature of experience, his commitment to experimentalism, and the interrelations between that experimentalism and democratic societies. In effect, this book is 'Dewey for Dummies.' Fine, but if you are not a dummy, you would do well either to read more Dewey or to read any number of the fine studies and analyses of Dewey's work by contemporary writers such as Alexander, Boisvert, Campbell, Dldridge, Hickman, Rockefeller, Sleeper, Stuhr, Sullivan, or Westbrook."

5,Postcards from Mars: Wish you were here.,This is a fantastic book! The photographs are beautiful and makes it seems as if you are really there. Anyone who likes Mars has to have this book.
5,Postcards from Mars,A significant contribution for lay population understanding the amazing inroads of recent astronomical exploration.
5,"If you are interested in Mars, buy it","For someone like me, who has been reading SF, inevitably much of it about the Red Planet, since early childhood, well over half a century ago, it is truly awesome to own a book of photographs of Mars. That being the case, I would have been impressed had these been grainy b&w; prints, but they are not. The quality is astounding, as though the photographer had actually been there and brought them back. If you are sufficiently interested to have read this far, I suggest you would not be disappointed were you to buy the book.Sadly, no Martians, though....Yet."
5,A fine oversized presentation perfect for any astronomy or general lending collection,"POSTCARDS FROM MARS: THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER ON THE RED PLANET offers more photos fro a mission originally only planned to last ninety Mars days - and which is beginning its 7th year. The Mars Rove continues to transmit data and photos and over 250,000 photos have been received to date, with new discoveries being made regularly. Available for the first time in paperback with a new foreword from Bill Nye, this shares color images from the mission in a fine oversized presentation perfect for any astronomy or general lending collection."
1,JUNK !!!!,Failed after about one hour. Sure wish I had read the reviews on this item before purchasing. Do not waste your money!
1,A real POS would never buy again,"This pump was a piece of crap. The insulation on the negative wire was broken where it enters the housing. I decided to try and use it anyway and taped it up the best I could. I threaded the fitting into the end of the pump and the plastic housing cracked...spilled fuel all over my garage when I turned it on. Took it back to the store and got my 44.00, then spent 100.00 on one assembled in the USA instead of the China crap pump."
4,DEMO ENGINE FUEL PUMP,Needed a compact electric pump fuel for an operating demo engine.Small size and decent mounting made this perfect for the application.Will try it on aux generators as well.
4,accessory fuel pump mower,"Works as described. Installed on Kohler twin magnum garden tractor. Bypassed the factory pump. So far so good, but I haven't run it much. Decent price. I fused the hot side of the pump with a mini 5-amp. A precaution since several reviews seemed to have smoked their units. Might give is 5 stars, maybe only 2. Time will tell."
3,Fuel pump,Only problem with the pump is it arrived with the plastic container cut open and smelled like it was used.Very dissapointed with that. Otherwise seems to work ok?
1,dont buy,i installed this fuel pump on my honda trs 350 4 wheeler and it worked great for the 5 minutes i used it.i then went on vacation for 2 weeks.when i got back and tried to start my 4 wheeler the fuel pump would not work.
5,Tamrac Expedition 7 Backpack,"This is the new version of the Expedition 7 backpack from Tamrac. The only shortcoming is that it bears the same name as the old Expedition 7 which can be confusing when ordering. The improvements over the old version are well worth the cost of the bag. Convenient, sits well on one's back, well made, good looking, easy to use."
4,An unexpected gem!!!,"I purchased this movie based on the cover (front and back), since I had never heard of it prior to seeing it in the store. Boy am I glad I took a chance. This was a wonderful story, with action, suspense and an unpredictable twist.I highly recommend this movie."
4,Brilliant,"A superb acting from Bronsan,Butler,and Bello..the movie keeps you guessing till the end..a really enjoyable albeit nerve wracking type of movie:)"
4,"Solid thriller without gratuitous violence/sex, etc",This movie is a solid thriller that has a message to it as well. Name a better thriller recently that was more on point and without gratuitous sex and violence? I'm sure you can't name more than 2-3. This movie is a solid 4 stars and keeps the viewer engaged and thinking about how they would respond. Keeps the action and situations moving.
3,"Great Actors, Poor Script","Shattered (Butterfly On A Wheel) is the story of Neil and Abby Randall (played by Gerard Butler and Maria Bello) who find there perfect life shattered at the hands of a kidnapper, Tom Ryan (played by Pierce Brosnan). Tom Ryan informs the couple that they have 24 hours to do as he says, or he will kill the Randall's daughter. It is here that this thriller gets moving.Overall, Shattered isn't a bad thriller. The story is a good one, and the acting is very good. But what ultimately shatters Shattered is the poor script. The dialog between characters is poorly crafter, leaving this strong pool of actors with very little to work with other than cliches.Also, you find yourself saying (over and over again): ""she should have..."", ""why didn't he..."", and ""I can't believe they didn't do so and so, I would have..."". The story isn't believable because the protagonists don't do what you and I would do in a similiar situation."
4,Suspenseful,Good acting and cast. I saw the tv version of this film and it was good. Gerard Butler was very good in it. The end is all about what comes around goes around!
1,Excruciatingly Boring,And I didn't care a bit about any of the characters. Brosnan must have been in a career slump.
3,Shattered,This was a very interesting movie. Full of twists and turns. Was dissappointed in the chemistry between Maria Bello and Gerard Butler. Pierce Brosnan was interesting as the bad guy. Gerard Butler's character could have been developed better.
4,Totally unexpected GOOD!,"At last I got to see that movie after waiting so long. What a great movie with a totally unexpected ending. Both Bronson and Butler acted their parts so well that one is totally thrown. Wonderful plot. Enough said, get the DVD and see the movie for yourself. Do not let anyone tell you too much it will spoil it for you."
4,Very good with maybe a twist or two too many,"A lot of people weren't too impressed with this but if you're sick of noisy, gory movies full of explosions, this might keep you in suspense without them. The first time I saw it on DVD I thought the tension was almost unbearable.I just really enjoyed it and I'm in the middle of watching it again even though I know the twists.Well worth watching, in my opinion. But... it's all subjective, eh?"
3,Better than Jumper!,"So many great technical reviews here that I will only say I also saw ""Jumper"" this week...and, in comparison, Shattered seemed quite good! :>) You start out hating Brosnan's character but end up, on account of the story twist, thinking maybe he's not all THAT awful. Gerard Butler's character evolution goes in just the opposite direction. Can't say much more without giving away the plot. You know all the way through that there's gotta be a revelation that flips the story on its ear; all must not be what it seems (otherwise, this film really would be awful). The twist does finally come and I was not disappointed."
1,Makes you feel depressed and helpless!,"This movie is great if you love watching someone respond helplessly while their life torn apart. Meanwhile the entire time you will yell (and wish they could here you) ""Do something to stop them already! Why are you putting up with this?""If you dont mind feeling depressed and helpless, or are willing to endure it for the surprise ending, then this movie may be for you.I'm a little surprised by the number of possitive reviews. I give this movie 0 stars. I also ask that my two hours be returned to me. I'll get back to you when I can think of a movie bad enough to compare it to."
3,Taking Revenge,"More known as ""Butterfly on a wheel"", this story is of revenge a betrayed husband took over his wife's lover.It is long and boring."
4,Simple and effective,"Good strong material and straps so it looks as though it will last well. Made in the USA too so that is nice. I plan to use this to carry the tripod short distances where damage is unlikely so I can manage without padding. I do have a padded bag (Manfrotto) which I keep the tripod in when it is in my car. One suggestion is that the product could probably be improved with some light padding at one end, such as a light foam material. That would not add much to weight or bulk, or cost."
5,GANGSTA GANGSTA!,"Wow. I got my master's degree in film, but reading some of these reviews I have got to imagine there are some PHD'S out there too! Bottom line: A landmark film, with a great story and top of the line photography. Keep an eye for the director's use of the ""X"" in his lighting techniques. Other than that, don't get too cerebral or caught up in these ""academician discussions"". Its a bad ganster who got what was coming to him! Enjoy, but don't fry your brain on teh artistic subtleties. Great film!"
2,An Overrated Movie,"I guess for the time period of 1932 this movie was considered somewhat of a classic. I was disappointed. The movie plays loose with the facts as various characters play the rolls of Al Capone, Jim Colosimo, Johnny Torrio, Dean O'Banion, Hymie Weiss, Bugs Moran, and Machine Gun Jack McGurn. All the gangsters play their rolls to the hilt with the stereotypical cigarette dangling between their lips. I guess this movie illustrates how far movies have come since the 1930's. I enjoy James Cagney gangster movies such as ""White Heat"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", but ""Scarface"" certainly won't have a permanent place in my library."
3,good for shared space,"This is amusing for about 20 minutes, until you've seen the little guys do their thing and seen them fall and get shook up. This is not a toy to play with repeatedly, but it is a good toy to have if your desk gets visited by others...will give them something to do while waiting for you or give you something to do when you'd wish they would leave."
3,Disappointed-dead battery,I bought these as a gift for my nephew and the battery was dead. They were supposed to be new. I was very unsatisfied with that.
2,Silly & Nonsensical,"This item is silly and nonsensical - and the kids love it. But as with most passive ""toys,"" once it is out of sight.... The toys really do interact with themselves and they do live up to their own hype of one figure entering the other figure's cube. However, the kids can watch for only so long before it becomes passe and for $20+ per set I'd rather get something that will keep them active and engaged. With TV, game consoles, portable games, and now cell phones to keep them ""occupied"" - this is just one more thing to put on the shelf (after the first 20 minutes)."
3,you get what you pay for,this has gone up since i purchased it for 25$ its pretty decent but it does give off excess noise you really have to play with it to get rid of it but you only really notice it at low volume id reccomend just getting a head unit with a full equalizer and 3 sets of rca out. you get what you pay for
5,Too Marvellous for Words,"Jo Stafford has been in my Record/CD collection for 50 years. No one can sing as she can, pitch perfect, singing the the songs as WRITTEN, no note bending, and so on. Jo Stafford is the best and no other singer comes close.I first heard Jo while passing a record store. The door opened and I heard ""If"". I rushed in and asked who that singer was, from that time I bought every record Jo ever made. Simply the finest singer ever. Now you can get nearly every song Jo recorded, there are a few missing like ""Allentown Jail"" and ""Chantilly Lace"" to name two.I recently played ""No other Love"" to a friend, who promptly burst into tears, ""The most beautiful song I ever heard, and so beautifully sung"". Well of course the singer is Jo, and the music Chopin, what a combination!This boxed set is a good start, a very well chosen set. Buy it, you will not regret it. 70 plus songs all well worth repeated listening, I cannot recomend this highly enough."
4,"Hop, Hop, Hop Little Bunnies!",This is one of the better professionally made Ramones videos. Mostly because it has a lot of their videos on it. Some interviews. Pretty good. But how good does a video of the Ramones need to be for you to buy it? They are the Ramones! And they are good little bunnies with fluffy ears and tails!
5,This is a bible for Ramones fans!,If you missed the videos from the classic Ramones videos this is your video! Great for Ramones fans but I guess nothing for an outsider. Nevertheless top class if you love the Ramones.
2,Identical to other titles by same author,"What a rip-off. This book is 100% identical in content to a book by the same author with simply a title change, called Ribbon Details. The ONLY difference is the title and the picture on the front cover! Most of the projects are things we've all thought of and done before: wrapping flower stems with ribbon, curtain tie-backs, edging a blanket, etc. Save your money and buy either one or the other title by Mary Norden, but not both!"
3,Very nice,"A happy story: I started The Lightning Thief, a children's book,and then received this book. The first chapter of O Thou deals with words taken from Greek gods, and each entry in the chapter tells a little about each god and why he was important. The Lightning Thief is the story of a boy who is half-god and he is being sought by many other Greek mythological creatures. O Thou gave me enough info about each god and mythological creature mentioned in The Lightning Thief to help me anticipate events in the story. Very nice."
3,flashcards would be better,"I would rather have these in a flashcard format, so that English and Spanish words were written on the back of the card. There needs to be more cards, also, to cover more topics in the book.Overall, for what the cards are, they serve their intended purpose."
5,Love this show!,"This season kept me guessing and it left some of the best cliff hangers in each episode. Especially the season finale- I can't wait for season three which will answer these questions:What becomes of Lucas and Brooke?Will Haley and Nathan get back together now that Haley's returned?How will Peyton take to her long lost mother?And FINALLY the absolute most burning question everyone has:Who tried to kill Dan?My money is on Andy, Keith, Whitey, or Haley"
3,satisfaction,"This episode was beyond good to my cousin and brought her a large smile, the drama in this episode made her and her seven friends all awe as things got complicated. though my other male cousin said that the only interesting thing in this episode was that it had some good shots of Summer Altice."
4,Bond with your teens,"This is a great bonding product if you have teens (mine are 12,14 16) you can laugh about how rediculous some of it is, but talk about alot of the pertinent issues and learn alot from the comments they share during the show! Definitely chick flicks."
2,Waiting,"We got the dvd's in a timely manner, but it is a set and they did not come in the case like i would of liked, but since I only paid $10 plus shipping that was not a major issue. But all dvd's skipped and one would not play at all. The seller offered to refund or fix, I ask her to fix them so I sent them back at my expense and have not got them back or heard from the seller."
3,This season was awesome it had so many TWISTS!,I love OTH the first season kicked butt and I couldn`t wait till the next season and the next season was great except for a few episodes that were in the middle.The whole Nathan and Haley thing that was awful he needed to stop chasing after her but when Nathan met up with Taylor that was awesome. I thought it was pretty lame he kept chasing after Haley.Wait for her to come back.I love how it heated up at the end of the season. The last episode I would give more than 5 stars 6 stars is what it`s worth.I can`t believe Peyton`s mom came back I can`t wait to see what happens next.If you don`t watch this show you have to. If you don`t want to you better because it`s addictive.BUY THE SEASON PEOPLE!!!
5,one tree two,"Great series... Pitty the Sydney channel keeps stuffing everyone around by moving or not showing the show in the name of, rateings???"
4,OTH Second Season Review,"I loved the second season of One Tree Hill. If you have not seen it, i would highly recommend that you do. If you liked the first season of the show then you'll love the second season of this show. The cast does an amazing job at portraying these wonderful, colorful characters. The cast themselves aren't bad to look at. The show is more than jsut a show for teens. It deals with real issues, real bond, real relationships. It makes you seem like you've known these characters since they were little, like your right there with them. It has twists and turns taht will have you on the edge of your seat, guessing what will happen next and have your jaw on the floor at the end of each episode. Two thumbs up :)."
5,Love One Tree Hill,"Granted, this season was not as good as the first, but it was still awesome!!! Looking forward to season 3. I usually never watch the shows when they are on prime time. I start watching after they move to another channel. I'm glad I started watching One Tree Hill on Soapnet, I am hooked!!!"
3,Full Disclosure would have been appreciated,"I received my product within the period of time I was told I would. My only problem was the box. It was not in good shape at all. The paper was ripped and the plastic part had pieces broken off. At first I thought it might have happened during shipping, but it was hastily taped back to together and not inconspicuously so. This all would have been fine with me, because the discs were in perfect condition, if it had been disclosed at the time of purchase. I suppose we might just have different perceptions of what ""very good condition"" means. The discs play fine though and that's the most important part."
1,Boring...,"I hate this show... You cannot possibly say this show has a 5 star... This is one of the worst TV show on Earth. However, i think 1st season is better than the 2nd Season"
1,How can u give this show a five star,"This show is absolutely boring. It has absolutely no comedy... Use something better... like a better storyline, and better characters!!"
1,OMG...,"This is an absolutely horrible show. It's dumb. Plus it's just another copy of The OC, Summerland, etc... Blah blah blah... It needs more CREATIVITY!! However, the cast is good...In such case i'll suggest u to watch Laguna Beach.. where everything it's kind of REAL!"
2,"Good show, bad case","I was naturally pleased with the show as it's one of my favorites, however the case I quickly began to have problems with. Almost immediately when I got it, the glue the held the case together began to come off along with the tape, which made every disc holder come apart. It seemed like cheap plastic taped together in the end. I had to return it, and I got it back, but not long after the plastic shattered somehow, leaving me with no option but to replace it yet again. I'd recommend buying the new version (2009) to this one."
5,Fast and in great condition,I received my movie very promptly and it came in excellent. Thank you very much. I would buy from this merchant again.
5,Love One Tree Hill.,My daughter and I absolutely love One Tree Hill. We watch these DVD's over and over again.
4,If you like the show- its a must have,"one tree hill the complete second season is a great DVD set to have. I'm addicted to the show so of course this is why i feel this way, but if you have seen season 1 and like it you should definitley purchase season 2. It becomes more intesresting with new twists and turns, and great plots. The bonus features are great, including commenteries and little inside scoops no one else knows. Each character develops majorly and you will learn to love the characters even more then before- if that's even possible. If you are satisfied with this product, i would definitley recommend One Tree Hill The Complete Third Season as well. It is by far the best season and you will not regret it."
1,Victor's guilt,"Another posturing academic who believes that American and British citizen-soldiers should have been willing to take more casualties in order to spare the peoples of Germany and Japan unnecessary suffering. These flavor of books tend to suffer from the fact that the authors are too timid to state exactly how many more Allied deaths they believe would have been acceptable in order to achieve victory under their more ""moral"" code of war."
3,An ill-fated attempt to revise history,"Grayling attempts to thrust modern mores on the actions undertaken by Allied Air Forces during World War II in the fire-bombing of German and Japanese cities. While the loss of life and property was horrific, at the time airpower theorists firmly believed attacking the populace would bring about a quicker end to the war, a war which was already horrific and which followed an earlier horrific war. In hindsight, the firebombing was ineffective in achieving its desired result and would not be undertaken again because the military effect was not commiserate with the civilian loss of life, but that does not make the firebombing or subsequent atomic strikes immoral at the time.On the flip side, the scholarship and writing are top-notch...unfortunately the conclusions are not."
3,A Good Idea Marred.,"This is a very good effort marred by bad scholarship. Incorrect dates, pertinent information overlooked or possibly not even known, mistaken technical and historical data. Overall a disappointing book.The author tries, without actually succeeding, to question the logic in attacking the very people that you want to assist you. If the point of the bombing was to persuade the people of Germany to overthrow their government and make peace, then dropping death and destruction on them along with ""Unconditional Surrender"", with all THAT implies, is surely a very strange way to go about it.If, on the other hand, the purpose was not to have them come to terms with the allies, then a very ugly possibility arises and impugns the humanity and virtue of those who are historicaly and daily honored among the allied nations.The good news is that people are finally trying to take a more balanced look at the major events of the twentieth century."
5,I like this.,I live in Brazil and I am very satisfied with the purchases I made on this site. I urge all consumers. Thank you.
2,Anglican Church Music,"Disc one is quite lovely altho this kind of music is a bit long on reverb for my taste. Disc two is very short, comprised of what I guess is Anglican plainchant. Plain chant, (properly conceived) can be delightful, (tho not to every one) but this is just monotonous, repetitious and rather dull."
5,real,"i watch this episode everytime it comes on. dave just keeps it real about everything from how you get treated by friends, family, fans and hollywood. i appreciated his realness. i didn't know it was available on dvd, looks like this is one to add to my collection."
5,Very good.,"This is an excellent first choice to get acquinted with Mr. Armstrong and his All-Stars. The tracks are very clear, and Armstrong has some stunning solos. I would recommend it to a beginner. However, I would say that his live albums are a better pick overall. He really goes all-out."
4,grand example of original jazz how it was meant to be.,excellent collection of the greatest from louie a
5,Movie Starring Johnny Cash,"Johnny Cash plays a great role in ""The Pride of Jesse Hallum"" and is very believable (as I am from Kentucky). This is a must see movie, especially for any school age child who feels it is a waste of time going to school and learning. The other movie on this disk depicts Cash as a criminal and is nowhere as good as the first one."
5,Creating the Perfect Canine Companion,"As with all of Cesar's DVD's and books, you can EASILY retrain your dog, ANY DOG, by retraining yourself. We ""rehabilitated"" all 4 of our dogs employing Cesar's methods; within TWO WEEKS we had absolutely PERFECT dogs. I STRONGLY recommend Cesar's products as I use many of them. Love my dogs and now they are ""balanced""."
5,A MUST WATCH!!!,"i am an avid fan of cesar milan. anyone that is even thinking abotu getting a dog or wants to help understand their dog's behavior NEEDS to watch this. it's simple to understand and entertaining for those without pets. i've implemented his methods with my own dog and others' and he's dead on. it's amazing to see the transformations of the owners and the pets! Read his book as well ""cesar's way"" for a better understanding of his methods. 5 stars!!!!!!! i can't wait to get season 2"
4,Big help for foster puppies,"I found watching these videos to be very helpfull with raising my foster pups. Using Cesar Millan's method of pack order and body language to teach and socialize the pups, I find that families are much more open to adopting."
5,cant get enough of this,"Cesar shines a light on many issues modern dog owners have, and how to remedy them. Its fascinating to watch him work."
3,Dogs and their owners,"As a new dog owner, I was anxious to learn the tricks of the trade, as it were, and at the same time not ruin our puppy's essentially wonderful personality. The Dog Whisperer was truly helpful in that, although I admit to not having been 100% successful in applying the techniques that Cesar demonstrates. It's interesting to see the problems owners have with all sorts of dogs, and that doogs have with all sorts of owners, but the episodes become a bit repititious, because the solution is always pretty much the same every time."
2,poor sound,"Good show, poor sound quality on these instant videos for some reason. Complained but no way to know if they ever fixed it without paying again."
5,Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan,"Excellent. Very helpful in helping with dog and people situations. Highly recommend any dog owner to purchase this, even if you don't have a problem dog. It's very informative."
4,Cesar rocks,"This is required watching for all dog owners. We can all learn something from him. It gets repetative, but isn't that what humans and dogs need?"
5,Cesar is wonderful,"This show is amazing, as a puppy owner I found it extremely useful in my dealings with my animal. He seems to have three big themes; be the pack leader, put the dog is a calm-submissive position, and remember that the dog is an animal - not a person. Millan is Dr. Dolittle, only real."
4,Helpful for Dog Rescuers,"I rescue & rehabilitate dogs and was looking for help/tips on dealing with some of the more challenging issues (or dogs) I take in. I find Cesar Millan's methods mostly helpful although I wish there were less reiteration of the problem and more tips/explanation of the solution. The one thing that would have made this purchase more helpful to me is if the summaries of the episodes better explained the behavior challenges. I could have used an index---FOR EXAMPLE: if you are having problems with separation anxiety, check out Episodes 2, 3, 6.Anyway, I have no regrets about the big investment."
5,"Learning to Treat Dogs Like Dogs, Not Humans","Cesar Millan has an authentic love for dogs that resonates in this series where he visits people whose dogs have behavioral problems--biting, over-aggression, depression, anxiety, chronic barking, refusal to go on walks, refusal to submit to owner, to name a few--and Cesar shows the dog owners how to instil discipline, consistency, and mastery over their dogs. One thing I learned is that loving a dog as if the dog were a human is first a diservice to the dog and second an act of selfish neediness on the dog owner's part. Dogs have dog needs, Cesar Millan shows, and by giving the dog boundaries and discipline, rather than indulging the dog like a spoiled princess, the dog owner actually makes the dog more happy.I give Cesar Millan credit for raising our consciousness about dogs, and pets in general, and in this sense Millan is a great humanitarian."
3,"Entertaining, but not particularly illuminating","I had never seen Cesar's show on television, so purchased the DVDs in the hope of getting some pointers on dog psychology and training. While the shows are entertaining, they provide only a few general tips and make it seem as though every dog will immediately fall into line using the Cesar method. In the real world, things don't happen quite that fast, and watching Cesar can lead to discouragement if the results aren't as expected. The shows are fun to watch and a few basic pointers can be gleaned from watching them. However, one would only need to watch a half-dozen (or fewer) of the shows to glean those ideas as they tend to be repetitious and basically showcase Cesar. If you're interested in entertainment, buy the DVD. If you're looking for instruction on dog training, buy one of the many excellent books devoted to the subject."
2,Dog Whisperer methods are inhumane,"Dogs deserve humane treatment, and that is not what Mr. Milan's training gives them. Even aggression does not need to be treated with force and outdated training methods. Granted, the show is quite popular, but that doesn't mean the techniques are humane or should be done at home.The American Humane Association has written the following about his show:""The training tactics featured on Cesar Millan's `Dog Whisperer' program are inhumane, outdated and improper.""Another excerpt about the ""Dog Whisperer"" TV show: ""It also does a disservice to all the show's viewers by espousing an inaccurate message about what constitutes effective training and appropriate treatment of animals."""
1,Just Terrible,I was a fan of Cesar's until I bought this DVD set for a friend for Christmas. I was wondering why she didn't say much about it when I asked. She didn't say anything becuase IT IS TERRIBLE. Nothing but out-takes by amateur videographer.PLEASE don't waste your money on this. And someone out there knows Cesar tell him this production is giving him a bad reputation.
5,Simply awe inspiring!,No one understands the mind of a dog like Cesar. Each episode blew me away. Cesar is my new hero!
4,Questions for avid Ants fans,"I have been searching for the British version of ""Dirk Wears White Sox"" for about 13 years now. I was wondering if anyone who has listened to this knows if any of these songs were on that album that I heard in college on a friend's tape."
5,Great Halloween Fun!,"I first got this book when I was ten and loved it. The characters are likeable and it's exciting to watch the mystery unfold. The illustrations are detailed and they really help to paint the picture. I am 37 and I've read this book every Halloween since I was ten as a tradition! If I have kids, they will definitely be reading this book with me on Halloween in the future!"
3,DECENT HISTORICAL FOR A RAINY AFTERNOON!,"He was raised by the Apaches, she is captured by them and given to him as a slave. He feels he is unworthy of love since his father abused him and his mother abandoned him. She must break through his hard heart and teach him to love."
5,Great!,"Such a sweet romance and so fun to read. the characters are wonderful and the storyline is perfect. Not to be missed. I put it up there with my favorites of late, Anything, My love by Cynthia Simmons and Savage Thunder by Lindsey."
4,Excelent and on time,"The battery on the treos are not good enough about charge. If you use the palm and phone a lot, you have to have this cradle to charge two batteries at the same time.The syncro button does not exist, so you have to do it manualy."
5,A Great Deal!,I looked over quite a few chargers before choosing this one -- it does its job with no little plastic parts to break off. Just a solid product and a solid value.
4,"Good Charger, Cheap Price","Not a bad charger, cheap price. Good for charging TREO and extra battery at the same time. Just using for charger, not syncing to computer."
1,I'm looking for a better cradle,"This works OK as a battery charger, but it's lousy as a sync cradle. There is no sync button, and most of the time I get a ""can't connect"" error when I try to sync. Also, my USB bus kept hanging and I'd have unplug my system to fix it (rebooting or powering off didn't work). It started when I got this cradle, and it stopped when I gave up on this cradle and disconnected it's USB cable."
1,poor quality,"I bought this product less than 6 months ago. At first it would only charge the spare battery if the phone were also in the cradle charging. Now it doesn't charge the second battery at all, although it does still charge and sync the phone. I would try another product. Steve Ward"
2,Pointless reissues,"Although I'm giving them 2 stars for the gorgeous cover art (especially this one). Suffice to say, most SATC fans own the original individual season sets or the pink box. Do these new themed-sets feature ANYTHING new? No. No new commentaries, nothing. A waste of money and shelf space."
4,Entertaining for those who love warbirds.,"Heroes of Aviation is about warbirds, not individuals. Although the release date was in 2007 the most recent information in the series appears to be prior to Sept. 11th, 2001. The earliest footage goes back to the start of the aircraft carrier age. If you like sequences with lots of flying accompanied by music, without much information about the aircraft, this is for you. If not, use the fast forward. In some places there is sufficient information about the subject aircraft, while in others, not much is said about the aircraft while the video will show it circling for five minutes. Sometimes the narrator will be talking about one subject, such as air raids over Germany, while the video shows pictures of the carrier attacks over the Pacific. However, strongly considering the under $10 price for a five video set that runs 720 minutes, it is money you shouldn't regret spending."
1,"Inaccurate, irritating mistakes throughout. .","You get what you pay for. The reason this set of DVDs is so cheap must be due to the mistakes made throughout. For example, there is a sequence where the narrator is describing the SBD Dauntless, arguably the most successful WWII naval dive bomber deployed by either side in the war, while continually displaying film of the SB2C Helldiver which was its (very troubled)successor. There are repeated instances where the narration describes one type of action ( a naval engagement) and illustrates with an entirely different activity (an air strike on a land base). Facts are frequently garbled. ""By the end of 1945, the war in Europe was coming to an end."" May is not the end of the year. The same footage repeats over and over at different points in the narrative. It is just regularly irritating if you have more than a rudimentary acquaintance with the actual facts."
1,Unsatisfied!!,"I love this song. And I tried to order it for my ministry. But I never received this cd. Amazon.com did give me my money back. I am very apprehensive about trying to order it, again!! Bishop Ray Bryant"
1,Man About Town,This is a confused and rather dreadful movie. The only person who emerges with any credit is Rebecca Romijn - who could have a real future if she is given the right roles.
2,DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT WANTS TO BE,"This movie was very weird and I really didn't know if it was a drama or a comedy. The acting and story are OK. I guess it shows, I wasn't really impressed by this movie,but it was an OK watch. If your bored and want to see it, rent it."
3,Similar to others..,"This book is similar to other collecting books, a lot about the history of the hobby. Not a great reference if you want quick info on a certain coin."
4,"Hello ,Michael Here","Hello , Covers all the basics quite nicely , easy to read and understand. I would strongly suggest you read this book and at least one other on your specific interest before you spend a dime on coins."
2,Coin Collecting For Dummies,"This is a great book if you want to learn the ins and outs of a big time coin dealer/collector...mostly buying and selling.. I'm more into Collecting and learning about diffrent error coins.""TR"""
3,Coins for Dummys,There was not much of a discription of what the contents of the book contained. Looking for a book that would give the value of the coins. It was informative but not really what we were looking for.
3,good,"Don't be fooled. Afro-Fire looks like a 1960s Blue Note album. But this actually came out in 2004. (I just realized Eddie's very UN-60S cornrows are a dead giveaway)Eddie Gale actually did make to albums for Blue Note in the late 1960s and early 70s, calledBlack Rhythm HappeningandEddie Gale's Ghetto Music. Avant jazz with tons of vocals. Amazing records that should be far more known. This was after working on Cecil Taylor'sUnit Structures.Afro Fire is not bad, but adds modern beats and synth sounds. Gale's playing on this is excellent--actually a lot better than in the 1960s, but the grooves are a little flat and you are keenly aware of lack of other players for Eddie to interact with.Still, not bad, and if you are fortunate enough to own his old Blue Note albums, this is worth a grab. For more interesting modern terrain, check outJoint Happening, an album Gale did with a band called Mushroom."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This product requires the use of very expensive and special Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR)toner, or the checks WILL NOT clear the Federal Reserves banks. I could not recomend this product for the personal user. Check to see if magnetic ink/toner is available for your printer and the associated costs before you decide to buy."
2,One of the worst Emanuelle themed movies ever!!!,"Look people I would have given it less if it werent for the gobs of nudity. There was no story at all, no plot at all no nothing except nudity. How dare these people put this as an Emanuelle moveie!!! they should be ashamed! there was no Laura Gemser no Sylvia Kristal not even the chicks in the other ones. It [stupid] really except for the nudity I hated it."
3,Been there,"Some insider insights make this interesting. Otherwise, an average twisted loyalty spy tale."
1,A Very Dull Read,"It goes like this...hero muses, is followed, takes a meeting, phones, travels, phones, takes a meeting, travels, phones, takes a meeting, phones, travels, takes a meeting, etc, etc. If this is what makes for a good novel, it's all yours. I don't care if this is how they do it in real life in the CIA, it's damn dull reading. The real mystery with this novel is why it ever got good reviews."
2,reads like 3rd rate .............,"gumshoe novel from the 60's.....I dont care if its based on fact or fiction, at least make it readable, which to me this wasnt. Too many run on sentences, irrelevant references, and way too much trying to be ""cool"". Sorry, no good in my book"
2,Breeze rather than blow,"I kept waiting for more action but it was slow starting. It was recommended along with Faithful Spy, which did fill my expectations,"
1,minus one star,"If Robert Baer had admired John le Carre more and Ian Fleming less, this might have been a good book."
3,3 and a half stars,"It was amusing and passed the time pleasantly on several occasions for a while.For a first fiction novel, it's good. Baer is a thoughtful, smart guy, and being a former CIA officer means he has a command of English.Stylistically, it needs some work. The pacing is not great. His use of metaphor is overdone. Characters are a problem. The protagonist gives us nothing likable about himself.I think that is because Bob is venting and that's why Max comes off as angry at everything.He does have a talent for well flowing, easy to follow action, although the first 50 pages could be skipped almost entirely.I'd be interested in seeing a 3rd or 4th novel if he keeps it up."
3,Disapointing,"As a reader of all DeMille products maybe I expected more after reading Robert Baer's ""See No Evil"". I guess sometimes truth is 'stranger'?, no, more entertaining than fiction. However, a lifetime interest in all things intelligence related will encourage me to bring home the next Baer offering."
5,Blow the House Down: A book that you can't put down!,"Robert Baer writes the truth, in this ""fictional novel"", about what really happened on 9/11. He is a bold, honest individual who deeply cares about his country and the absolutely necessary job of running agents. The spy business cannot exist on satellite views and wire tapping alone. When operatives such as Baer, risk their lives for accumulating accurate national security information, there must be leaders who follow through with this information on behalf of the American public--not to enrich their own personal pockets.Robert Baer keeps his finger on the pulse of the truth and he still works in the Middle East, to this day, as a journalist for Time. Heidi Hamilton"
2,Stick to Non-Fiction,"I expected more from Baer after his ""See no Evil"". However, novel writing is a little different than non-fiction, especially when you are trying to write, based on solid experiences.This novel lacks action, it is dull, predictable, pedestrian, slow, and the charcters are wooden and un-interesting. Therefore, it is a forgettable story. I still remember the first James Bond book I read many years ago. Having read Blow the House Down recently, the story is already forgotten and I could care less about the characters.I think Baer has a lot to say, given the current political climate. However, as noted, I suggest he stick with what he knows and present it in a non-fiction format."
2,Author got carried away with goverment conspiracies,"I think the author got carried away with government conspiracies, we could not tell what agencies (fbi, cia, nsa, etc) was having who hit. I agree with other reviewers that Ashman was a great character but the author lost it and never finished the story which had a good start. Save your time and money for another book - try Steven Hunter ""Point of impact"" or ""Black Light"" or by Franklin Allen Leib ""Behold a Pale Horse"" or by Robert Littell ""Walking Back the Cat""."
1,Deserves Less Than One Star,"I purchased this and two other Minka Aire ceiling fans in July 2010 (regrettably, before the above reviews were posted). I had them installed in my new home in September 2010, and the fans and the installation cost me thousands of dollars. A couple of weeks ago, the light bulbs on this particular model burned out rather badly, and the fan stopped working. I called an electrician who told me the wall control was defective, and I contacted Minka Aire on March 24, 2011 online and via email, and again a few days later, with no reply whatsoever. I ended up purchasing a replacement part from my local Lamps Plus, along with new bulbs and the expense of a return visit from the electrician, which has cost me another few hundreds of dollars! If a company cannot stand behind their product, and worse yet, has zero regard for their customers, I have to advise all of you out there to shop with a more deserving company. I will never buy another Minka product!"
5,Kisses Burn,This book is an exciting and fast read. It's excellent.It was written by a woman who overcame severe dyslexia in her childhood. She's a great example of a success story.
5,Look no further,"I became interested in this product, because of other products I had experienced from Young Living. I hesitated about purchasing it, because of the price. Finally, after using a couple of skin care lines that weren't measuring up to my expectations, I decided to give ART a try. I am glad that I did. I guess the only regret I have is not starting sooner. I've always had dry skin, and now my skin is normal. It feels great, and looks even better. I've always been prone to an occasional breakout, and have not had one in the 2 months that I have been using this. I have been able to stop wearing foundation since using this skin care system as well. My skin really looks good enough to go without it. This product exceeded my expectations and I am sure it will yours too."
1,Collagen Breakdown in a Bottle!,"So many people are enticed into thinking that essential oils are good for the skin. Well, in truth, they are not. Essential oils such as those contained in these products are toxic. Essential oils cause collagen breakdown in the skin, which leads to premature aging. They also are proven to cause cell death, photo-toxicity, and dermatitis, just to name a few harmful side effects of essential oils. Before I was informed of such hazards of using essential oils, I tried this line. Sure, my skin felt and looked great, but what about the hidden dangers that were going on with my skin. This product range also has a complete disregard for sun protection, which in fact is the only way to prevent aging and to retain your youthful appearance. As I always say, ""If it works for you, then use it."" However, I cherish the health of my skin and body too much to use essential oils."
2,Paul Williams the best of Bluegrass Gospel,"I have 3 of Pauls CDs and plan to purchase more, they are the best Bluegrass Gospel Music on the market."
1,Worked for 3 months!!,"After my first shipped adapter stopped working after 2 weeks, My replacement adapter from wholesalelaptopbattery stopped working after 3 months. Seems to be cheaply made with thin cables that short out. It's unfortunate that I have to pay $50+ to get an official Adapter from HP, but at least I will know it works!"
1,Not Satisfied!,"I am not happy and although I would love to, I cannot send out a review on Burt's Bee Carrot Soap. This is the product I ordered but NOT the product I received, and I was not happy about it. When I asked Amazon about the issue, I was sent a 2 page email with a bunch of jargon which was basically a lot of red tape and nonsense. When it all boils down to it, I should have just ordered directly from Burt's Bees. This is not my first time ordering from Amazon and up to this point I had been satisfied, but I'm not sure I'll be ordering from them again since there is no guarantee I'll get what I order when it comes through a third party.Signing off as a dissatisfied customer.BH"
4,It's pretty good.,"I ordered this CD together with DUKE ELLINGTON-THE PIANO PRINCE AND HIS ORCHESTRA. I wanted these two items to teach my children about Edward Kennedy ""Duke"" Ellington. I was concerned that the children might find the music old fashioned, especially because most of the tracks are mono. To my relief and surprise, the kids love the CD! Now, they want me to order another CD that has ""Brown and Beige."""
5,The Tamrac 604 is a great camera bag!,"This is a great camera bag! It holds my DSLR, speed light and 3 lenses without a problem. I like the fact that I can also carry a 6 inch flexible mini tripod tucked into the bag also. The materials used in manufacturing are first quality. The front access storage compartment has ample room for all the cables, charger, extra batteries, etc. I also keep my lens blower and cleaning stuff in it with room to spare. All of this in a bag that isn't so big that it becomes a burden to carry around. I recently returned from visiting and photographing Mayan ruins in Southern Mexico. This bag not only allowed me to carry the gear I needed it also protected it. Hiking around the ruins, setting the bag on rocks and dirt didn't matter. I would highly recommend this camera bag to any one."
3,When they say safety glasses they mean it,I have owned a pair of these sunglasses for about two years now. Unfortunately at this point the rubberized part of the frame that rests over the ears have worn off and the rubber piece that fits over the nose is gone now leaving four plastic prongs jetting out.Pros:Edge eyewear's lenses as far as durability are really incredible.Cheap and they workBallistics protectionCons:Visibility though is not so great at least right now after daily use.Material quality and attention to detail could be better at key partsWill fall apart over timeFeels and looks cheapI'm personally trying out one more pair of edge eyewear glasses. If I'm not thrilled with them they will be exclusively used for the range
4,"A little dry, but very informative","This DVD is a little dry, as it is mostly discussions from specialists in the field. But, it is very informative, and a very good educational item. If you are into early civilization theories, this is for you. If you are expecting more entertainment than education, though, look elsewhere."
3,Ok..for the price...,"For a beginner, this is a good start up kit but would like for the net bag to be of better quality, more durable."
3,Tether,"Assembly is a bit of a hassle, better if the tether were preassembled. Instructions are straight forward. Product works as described."
2,Not so good ...,"Simple product, easy to set up. But the bungee cord included is flimsy and breaks easily - and this is just with a 12-year old user."
1,soccer coach/athletic director review,"I purchased this product for my kids and was excited about the idea of a ball being able to return. BUT, after receiving the product was very disappointed in product. It was very confusing as to how it was put together or else I don't understand directions well. I have been a athletic director and coach for 13 years and it was very difficult for me to put together correctly based on limited directions given. I still didn't put it together the way the directions said :) In consequence it is poorly used."
1,Pieces too weak,The cord snapped within 10 minutes of my 10 year old son's first go - he retied but then it snapped twice more in different spots. This was on the grass so nothing present to cut or rip the cord. The screw piece (for the ground) is also poorly made with the soldered bit splitting off easily (though it still functions it means a slightly exposed sharp edge). The handheld cord seems fine so far!
1,Net broke first use,"I purchased 2 of these for my daughters. By the 3rd kick, the soccer balls had ripped through the nets provided and rendered these products useless. Guess they might be ok if you don't actually try to kick a ball with them. Total waste of money."
2,"Love the idea, but the bungee broke","It was fun while it lasted, but you really can't use it if the bungee breaks! We had only used it a couple times to train a newbie player how to properly kick. It just didn't last very long. Too bad."
2,Good but the cord broke at the first use...!,"The concept of this tool is really good. We enjoyed practicing with it a lot. We were able to kick the ball at least 500 times, some times more than 20 shots in a row...Unfortunately the cord broke the first time we practiced. I had to attach it several times. My son is 12y and he broke it 2 or 3 times, and he cannot be that strong!!!I think that the cord is too short, so the shot has a lot of power in a short distance, that's why it broke...Now I have to buy a new cord and I have to spend more money, even if I think I paid enough to have a more durable product.The corkscrew anchor is a very useful tool!"
1,Absolute garbage!!!,"I purchased this item for my son who recently turned 12. He plays competitive soccer, I was looking for another training aide. This item looked like a solid trainer. The bungee cord snapped on the very first use. My son said he kicked the ball roughly 25 times and snap! What an absolute piece of garbage. Don't waste your money."
2,Missing Fiber information,"This would be a great book with a large number of food items analyzed, but it doesn't include the fiber information, something that can be very important to a diabetic since fiber can have a positive effect on blood sugar and cholesterol. I was going to return it, but it isn't worth it, so I just ordered The Complete Book of Food Counts by Corinne T. Netzer which has all the information needed."
4,"Book is ok, r you willing to spend the time 2 learn details?","Very similar to other biology books, there will not be a feature in this book that will make it stand-up from the other ones. In despite of that, I really recommend the website that accompanies this book. The animations are great to understand biological concepts such as PCR, operons, etc.Everything is in great detail (too much detail for my taste)... the organization could have been better to make the students understand better. Sometimes I feel it provides so many details that the big picture is lost! I think that the cellular respiration chapter organization was very confusing (it kept going from glycolisis to kreb's cycle back and forth.) It will be somewhat hard if you want to use this book to learn biology independently."
3,Generally Good Collection,"An oddball collection of tracks serve as a soundtrack. Three previously-released B-sides by 80's bands (TFF's ""New Star"", U2's ""Dancing Barefoot"" and Duran Duran's ""Make Me Smile"") are perhaps the strangest items here, but they're all OK. General Public's take on the Staple Singers' ""I'll Take You There"" is OK but starts to grate after awhile. Other highlights include New Order's inarguable ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" (which appears in an odd single mix), and The The's catchy ""That Was the Day"". Nothing on this album is truly bad, although several songs (Brad's ""Buttercup"", Teenage Fanclub's ""Like a Virgin"") simply aren't interesting. Probably worth picking up cheap."
4,Pick-me-up album,"This is one of my favorite chase-away-the-blues albums. The music is so upbeat and cheery, it can't help but get you dancing. I think Teenage Fanclub does a much better ""Like a Virgin"" than Madonna, although U2's cover of ""Dancing Barefoot"" doesn't carry the weight of Patti Smith's version. How many movies has ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" appeared in? Well, no matter, this New Order song doesn't get old, and it perks me right up."
4,fun tunes!,"I used to have this soundtrack as a tape and it died...that was several years ago, and now i'm buying it as a cd. i love it. the songs are fun, and the movie was hysterical!"
5,Truth,"I know all this is real because I was there! In this book you can see the truth about how God can be there with you in the most trying times, and how he can help you every minute of your suffering. From the very beginning of this story God's presence is known, felt, there! I recommend it to everybody in the world."
3,I've read better!!,"While I've never met a RG book I haven't liked, this one wasnt her best work. Between Kate's attitude and Rob's lack of interest, i did have to bounce back and forth with their moods. I won't say it wasn't good, it just wasn't all that great."
1,Not a sweet treat for Valentine's Day,"While Rachel Gibson has always been one of my favortie contemporary romance novelists, this book is one to skip. The story is forced; it has no natural flow. Unlike others from her that have kept me up at night until finished, this one put me to sleep - several times before I finally completed it. Also, I read romance novels to escape the stress of a hectic worklife and the craziness of our country's current domestic and foreign policies that are destroying our international reputation and leading us to moral and financial bankruptcy. I do not want to read about a principal character using voting for the first Bush as a timeframe in her life. Please, I know the author is from Idaho, but can we skip the red state/blue state intrusion into what should be relaxing literature?"
4,Could she twist him into a sexual pretzel?,"'The Trouble with Valentine's Day' by Rachel Gibson tells the story of Kate Hamilton who is PI in Vegas and moved back to Gospel, Idaho after she helps a man find his family and he kills them all. Rob Sutter an ex-NHL hockey player moved to Gospel, Idaho after a puck bunny shoots him after a one-night stand. Rachel and Rob have a memorable first meeting on Valentine's Day and humor and chemistry continue to flow until the last delightful end. I would also suggest Body Check by Deirdre Martin and Hot Number by Carly Phillips."
4,I liked it,"I have to say that I'm a little surprised by the number of negative reviews of this book. Usually I am in agreement with the overall rating of the book but not this time.Understandably the hero has some flaws, formerly cheating on his ex-wife and completely commitment phobic...but I think it shows a true character. He previously led a very charmed life as a professional hockey player, where women habitually threw themselves at him. When he got his girlfriend pregnant, he married her and tried to make it work. It made him real to me. I think that to have his history and not come off the way he does would be unbelievable.What I love, what I love about Rachel Gibson books is the humor. She is an enjoyable read and this is no exception. It's a great read for the beach or on a lazy day."
2,Just to second many other reviewers....,"I sure hope Ms. Gibson (and other authors) read these reviews, and realize some major mistakes were made in this book so that they do not happen again. Others have stated them very well, so I will just add my support - adultery is never sexy, most of us don't like the fu manchu (or at least reading about it over and over ad nauseum) and terrible editing makes a terrible impression on the reader. It's a good thing this is not Gibson's first novel, or many of us might not bother reading her again. Luckily for us all, we know she can do much better, so she will get away with this less-than-stellar addition to her body of work. And I will go re-read ""True Confessions"" so that TwVD is not my last memory of Gospel."
2,"an ok book, not much there","I agree with the criticisms posted on this site. There wasn't much to the book -- the hero wasn't too likeable, and the heroine didn't have much substance. Two things that particularly annoyed me: the Fu Manchu mustache (not only is it unattractive, but the term is horribly culturally insensitive), and the fact that the name of Dylan Taber (from True Confessions) was spelled Dillon throughout this book. Shouldn't an editor be able to fix these types of mistakes?"
2,Not as sweet at it sounds,"I have to agree with the reader that states: this book lacks the heart and emotion that her other books have, though I must say even after reading some of Mrs. Gibson's other books, none of them hold a flame to ""Truly,Madly, Yours"". That book, is by far, her best work, so if you're looking for a good read filled with heated chemistry, lots of heart, and a true page turner I highly recommend ""Truly, Madly, Yours"" as I already have in one of my other reviews. I must admit, while the fu muncha wasn't that much of a turn off for me as it was for others, the thing I couldn't get past was the disgusting 5 foot snake tatoo referred to throughout the novel a few times."
2,Stop with the facial hair!,"Yuck! I totally agree with the reviewers below, the FUMANCHU and the soul patch - what is going on? You think an owner of a HUMMER will have some money to buy a razor? Too much information for the reader, kept throwing me off track. Sorry, this is not a keeper. I'll go back to reader Gibson's earlier novels."
2,occasionally amusing but lacks the heart and emotions,"if someone else had written this perhaps i would've enjoyed it better, or i should say on a lighter less thoughtful level because i wouldn't have had particular expectations going in. but Rachel Gibson can and has done much better than this in my opinion. Rob's past was very unsavory and i found myself really disliking how he opted for self-exile and self-pity over any kind of regular involvement in his daughter's life. he did see her for a chunk of time each year so it's not that he was completely awol or anything but i guess i wanted him to care more about her (Rachel Gibson's book True Confessions featured a single dad who stole my heart he was such a great father). i will say kate and rob's first sex scene was very sexy but other than that their romance didn't really hook my emotions."
5,A winner!!!!,This was just the book I needed to pull me out of my winter blaa. This is such a fun read. The town of Gospel is a riot and the lovey story is fabulous.
2,The Trouble With Disappointing Book,"It's a shame that an author that brings ""Simply Irresistible"" and ""Truly Madly Yours"" will write something as disapponting as this. I don't buy the story, there is NO chemistry, the road to the relationship is flat, and like one of the reviewers here, the ""supposed-to-be-hero"" in this book CHEATS on his wife, he treats her quite badly, and suddenly he is ready for marriage?!?Please!!Not to mention the wrong spelling of Dylan Taber's character from ""True Confessions"". This is her own character, for Pete's sake.There is no scene in this book memorable enough to stay in my memory. It's pretty much out flat like her previous book, ""Daisy's Back in Town"". I'm sorry but I think I must take her out of my to-buy list."
1,This is not a bellhanger bit,"I purchased this through BIC Warehouse. A bellhanger bit has a hole in the tip. Once you have drilled a hole through the wall you push the bell wire through the hole in the bit, then pull the bit back to retrieve the wire.The pictoral instructions on the yellow plastic Dewalt sleeve the bit is packaged in demonstrate the process.The problem is THERE IS NO HOLE IN THE TIP OF THE BIT. There are no markings on the bit to indicate it actually is a Dewalt drill bit.Like many other reviewers have posted about many other products, it is questionable as to whether or not this is an actual Dewalt product, or a knockoff in a Dewalt sleeve.In any event, it's not a bellhanger bit. For the $10 I'll keep it, but caveat emptor when purchasing from BIC."
5,A modern view of the 'Deep South'!,"Keb'Mo'is like a modern reincarnation of the great Robert Johnson.His way to play this steel guitar is really a rich,cultural manifestation to the blues scenery! This acoustic album is highly recomended for those people that want to be in tune with the blues,for the first time! Great album,great vocal,great in all the ways!"
5,Just listen and smile!,"Keb' Mo' is the first artist in years to really touch me to the bone.I am partial to the up-tempo songs like ""Tell Everybody I Know"" and""Angelina"" but his slower tunes like ""Victims of Comfort"" and ""Anybody Seen My Girl"" have such beautifully expressive lyrics that you feel like he is the universal spokesperson of us all. I have two of Keb's CD's and am ready to pick up the third. His playing,singing, and writing, well, it all just makes you want to sit back,nod your head, and smile. Recommend this to everyone."
5,Robert Johnson of the '90s!!,"After seeing Keb on ""Austin City Limits"", a friend bought, and then played for me, this CD. I've been a Keb Mo fan ever since.The playing is true to the roots of Delta/Country blues with just enough of a contemporary feel so as not to distance any new-comers to the blues, but still keeping the ""purists"" happy. Not to mention the fact that Mr. Mo has a direct connection to wherever they keep all the great lyrics, hooks, and melodies.Amust for any blues fan ."
5,Very Good,"I'm not a real big fan of Blues but man do I like Keb'Mo's music. This CD is perfect for those warm summer days. Just put it in your car and roll the windows down and enjoy the sun and enjoy this fantastic CD by Keb'Mo'. He is truly amazing. Some of my favorite songs off this album are: ""City Boy"", ""Victims of Comfort"", and ""Tell Everybody I know""."
5,It doesn't get any better than this,"Keb Mo is one of the best things that has happened to the Blues in a long time. Classic CD, destined to become one of the all time greats."
3,"Good, but if you like this, there's much better","I give this album 3 stars not because it is necessarily bad, but because it seems like he is doing something that has been done better before, which makes this music seem a little unnecessary to me. His voice sounds almost exactly like Taj Majal's. I get a feeling like he has lived a great, happy life, and likes Taj Mahal and wants to sing the blues, but he hasn't ever experienced the blues. If you are looking at this and haven't heard Taj Mahal, go buy Taj Mahal's Best of Vol. 1. or his ""World Music"". That stuff is from the heart and so well written. Or if you want something contemporary, get a cd by ""Kelly Joe Phelps"". Keb Mo is a little poppy and water-ed down. but if that's what you want, go for it. It might be a really good introduction to the blues album if you havent heard any and want to get into it. But dont go thinking this guy is the messiah."
4,"Earthy, real, emotions sung through the blues of Keb Mo","I very much enjoy this albulm. After seeing Keb Mo for the first time at the Telluride Blues festival a few years ago, I have listened to his music. He was one of the artists who was sung by his songs versus just performing, in my opinion. His music is simple and easy in it's expression and his voice rich and deep in the telling of the tales."
5,Keb' Mo,"First album that I am aware of and beautiful voice and lyrics. He flew under my radar for many years but now I have all his music, I think.What a fantastic artist, If only he had some live shows in the heartland.Great acoustic album."
5,Keb' Mo' has no reason to sing the blues.,"Some might say, ""The blues? I just don't know."" The beauty is that it doesn't matter. Keb' Mo's debut album has exploded with a collection of old and new that can be appreciated by any listener at every level. Whether he is playing solo or with his band, there is something supernatural about the sounds that come from his voice and his guitar. The raw power of Robert Johnson meets digital recording to provide an outstanding sonic experience. This is a must have that ranks among the best overall albums of all time."
1,"Great History, Bad Writing","This is a great historical story, written so poorly, it made me want to cry. I hung in there because I'm interested in this era and its events, but I won't be buying the rest of the series. Mr. Frash worked very hard on this book; he did his research and he crafted a strong plot with interesting characters, but it just isn't written well. Maybe a good editor could have made a difference."
4,Great fun,"This album is great fun. My son has bounced up and down to it since at least six months. Fun for parents too. Great mix - Celtic to Caribbean to U.S. to Eastern European, Latin and African. Nice exposure and introduction to a diverse range of music."
1,hovercraft weak,"this is a fragile toy which just barely works. We used lighter weight heavy duty batteries to give it a little umph. Don't dare paint it--the paint is too heavy.It does have some educational value, but very little entertainment value."
3,Interesting Trash,This book is not going to win the Pulitzer prize but I have to admit it was ENTERTAINING. If you want something just for fun with no literary value (like Jackie Collins) this book is for you. It was a page turner for me but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for a serious read.
5,Malicious Intent,"Like the ""Godfather,"" this is one of those rare booksthat you just can't put down. It's laugh-out-loud funny,fast-paced, and sex-x-x-y. Just when you thought that Hollywood glitzhas worn thin the proverbial carpet, here's a juicy read that's as new and riviting and outrageous as its author - who's on the National Enquirer TV show and on Howard Stern. It's no wonder Howard loves this guy. He`s got all this inside scandal.And if you read between the lines, you'll recognize who these celebrities are. Walker does an end run past the stars and Hollywood powerbrokers who would otherwise sic their lawyers on him to shut him up -or their henchmen to bust his kneecaps. Hollywood is bound to make a movie of this, but no film can get inside the heads of these intriguing characters the way this book does. You want a great read? This book is for you."
2,Not very good for 70-229...,"Needing to pass another test to keep my MCSD cert, I tried this book as prep for 70-229. Did the whole thing and examples. From passing other cert tests I knew it was LIGHT on specifics!. Talkes a lot about SQL server and new features in a general way but skirts around necessary details, specifics and examples needed to pass...Had to buy another book(Que Exam Geer: 70-229 SQL Design/Implement) and then went and past the test..."
1,"Vague, poorly edited, and generally useless","After having read eight syngress books for certifications, this is the first time I had to get supplemental material to pass an exam. This book is vague, poorly organized, full of typos and syntax errors. It does not go into enough detail to help you pass the 70-229 exam or even gain a usable knowledge of MS SQL. This book is a waste of money. TRY SOMETHING ELSE!!!! I read ""Inside SQL Server 2000"" by Microsoft Press in order to pass the exam."
3,WHEN RELIGIOUS LEADERS HAVE SEX WITH THEIR FOLLOWERS,"Anson Shupe, William Stacy, & Susan E. Darnell, editorsBad Pastors: Clergy Misconduct in Modern America(New York: New York University Press, 2000) 256 pages(ISBN: 0-8147-8146-2; hardcover)(ISBN: 0-8147-8147-0; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: BV4811.5.B33 2000)A collection of articles on various forms of clergy misbehavior--both mainstream clergy and cult leaders.The problems of sexual and financial violations-of-trust continue.This book updates and expands the information already available.Almost all of the 12 authors are academics.Thus they have gathered their information from printed sourcesrather than from first-hand experience.Some books based on first-person accounts will be found here on the Internet:""BOOKS ON SEXUAL EXPLOITATION BY PROFESSIONALS""."
5,Just Buy It!!!!!,"Being a long term Boston Pops fan, and with a very limitied availablity in Australia for anything Boston Pops, probably now read Nil!!, this is a must have. It provides a range of music with 3 majestic conductors, and I love it.I was lucky enough to meet John Williams out the back of the Hollywood Bowl a couple of years ago, and he is a very nice man, and I love all of his work.If you like this kind of music, this DVD is a must have!!!!"
4,Broadway Pops,I love Broadway shows and the Pops so this was a great combination for an evening's viewing.
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed.When this was done the original performers were long in the tooth and past their prime on the whole.When performers were substituted, they did not come close to the originals."
2,Housewives at Play (Pin-Up Book),"I bought this just to see what kind of approach the author would take to this subject (OK, and some titillation also). It proved to be not too interesting."
4,housewives at play,"Again now if a man had dreamed up this book it would not be as good because Rebecca knows how a house wife and mum think and in this book she also has Teacher, girl lifeguards,doctors, and the good old husband sitting around reading of these books thinking what if.So if you are think what if go out and buy one and then just leave if on the table at home and then see what if.Again needs same story bubbles."
1,Reminds me of Creepy Crawlers,"Anyone remember making those gelly-like bugs in a mini extruding machine when you were a kid? Well, these noodles, though basically adopting the flavor of the sauce you dress them with, have that same, chewy, rubbery texture.I didn't find the smell offensive, and I was pleased with the appearance, since they looked very much like the real deal when I used them for lo mein. But after a few bites (about 50 per forkful) I decided it was just a bit too rubbery for me. I purchased 8 bags, and put the remaining 7 in the trash.I have to say, also, the ""8 oz"" package size is the prepared weight, not like with dried pasta...so 8 ounces of this stuff goes only half as far as the real thing.If you don't mind chewing, go for it...they will taste like whatever you cook them in. But I felt like I was eating creepy crawlers and just couldn't get beyond that.:<("
1,TOFU SHIRATAKI NOODLE - BAD,THESE NOODLES NEED TO BE REFRIGERATED AND ARE VERY COSTLY TO SHIP. THE SMELL OF NOODLE BEING PARBOILED AS INSTRUCTED ON THE LABLE STINKS UP THE WHOLE KITCHEN. WOULD NEVER ORDER OR BUT THEM AGAIN
1,shipping nightmare,I ordered these noodles online. They cost $1.99 a bag and the shipping was approximately $25.00. When I saw the huge cost of shipping I tried to back out of the sale but I had apparently already confirmed the order. I was furious and the bags are small. I advise you to go to a local Asian market. This shipper is a major rip off!! The noodles are great though!
4,Not bad,"These noodles are a low carb, high protein alternative to regular pasta. They are decent for stir frys and simple dishes. I would not recommend them with a heavy sauce as it will not ""cling"" to the noodles.The noodles need to be rinsed before cooking. This is very important unless you like fishy smelling food! You can get these cheap at Trader Joes."
1,Worst tofu product ever,"As a vegan, I have tried just about every tofu product on the market, and nothing ever came close to the terrible texture of these noodles.The smell when you opened the bag was not pleasant, but if you wash them off and parboil, that goes away, but is replaced with a slightly sweet smell that I disliked almost as much.But I kept an open mind, cooked the noodles for a few minutes, added my favorite sauce and fresh ground pepper with some soy cheese grated on top. Whoever said it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target, they are incredibly chewy and just don't taste that great either. Even as a low calorie food, it seems like a waste to spend 40 calories on these noodles."
2,Terrible shipping,I paid over $14 for shipping and I did not even receive the product until a month and a half later. I see something wrong with this and I am not happy...
2,Yuck!,First of all...the shipping cost was $18 for a $1.99 package of noodles that tasted peculiar enough that I couldn't finish them. I asked the company to cancel the order before it was shipped and they didn't. They wrote me that they would cut the shipping in half for my trouble. So I payed $10.99 for a bag of noodles that were gross in tast and texture...not worth it!
1,Tofu Shirataki Noodles,Do not bother to purchase these noodles. They are the worst thing I have ever tasted. They are like eating rubber bands. They should be on Fear Factor.
1,absolutely disgusting,"This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary. And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible. I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message. It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them. Don't waste your money on this supposedly ""great deal."" It's not worth it."
1,Shirataki noodle,Horrible. Felt like you were eating rubber. Had to take the trash out after throwing the package out because it smelt like dead fish. Ate one package threw 5 out.
5,Best Pasta Alternative,My wife is on a low carb diet and loves pasta. This product is satisfying as it indulges those pasta urges. Goew well with sauce. Product is now available in our local market--Publix.
2,Not worth it,The smell was horrible and they reminded me of squid. I just could not stomach them. They also have a rubbery texture making them difficult to eat.
4,You CAN Eat Noodles Again!,"My lovely wife and I discovered these noodles hidden in a corner of a cooler in the ""Tofu/Natural Foods"" (??) section of our local branch of a mega-mart chain. We were skeptical, but they LOOKED like spaghetti, and they WERE on sale. Are we glad we took the plunge! If you drain and rinse them well, and dry them thoroughly after cooking and before saucing, the tremendous savings in calories and carbs will be well worth the differences from traditional pasta. And there are recipies at the manufacturer's Web site -- try the Cheesy Noodle Bake with reduced-fat cheese for a guilt-free mac'n'cheese substitute! If your local store doesn't have'em, order'em today. They're NOT exact substitutes for traditional pasta, but they're the best alternative we've found!"
4,better shipping rate available,"I agree the shipping rate is terrible at the Amazon source.If you like this product, shop online at Low Carb-U. They have a flat rate shipping charge of $8.00."
4,Surprisingly good!,"While there was a bit of drama actually getting these (they're so popular they were backordered!) I just tried them and they're really very good. (Word or warning, you must refrigerate these! So when you get your package from UPS don't let them sit too long.) They do smell when you first open them but if you spend any time rinsing/boiling them it's not an issue. They have a very slippery texture but they're far from inedible. I added some parmesan cheese to them and realized that they don't have that much of a taste, so adding them into some sauce is probably your best bet. I just ate the entire package, am full, and feel good that what I ate was super healthy!"
2,Tofu Spaghetti,"I did not like the tofu spaghetti. It did not taste like spaghetti to me. I thought it would take on the taste that I would cook it in. I tried extreme garlic and spaghetti sauce, but I couldn't eat it. It got here very quickly and was packaged very well though."
3,"Not for everyone, but good for some.","Part of the reason noodles are a comfort food is because you can slurp them down and don't really need to chew. The problem I found with these noodles is you really need to chew chew chew or you will choke. Much like if you were eating meat.I bought these to be a low calorie replacement to Ramen noodles, and they are. I threw away the noodle cake that came with Ramen and used the flavor pack on the equivilent amount of shirataki noodles.I couldn't eat them. Way too firm for me. Like tiny compressed lines of squid, or edible rubber. My mother could eat them though, and was happy for all the food without the calories.I would really like to see them meld these noodles with wheat noodles so that they're softer, but still save on some of the calories. I won't be able to eat these as is. (But my mother did)."
1,Still have not received this order,I ordered these on 1/29/06 and still have not received them as of 2/18/06. And no email saying the order would be delayed. My credit card has been charged also.
4,Really Good Stuff,"The product arrived packaged well. The noodles were cold, and after reading the cooking directions, we had great fun."
1,"Sorry, Its Awful","After reading about these noodles on Hungry Girl and following all the buzz, I had to try them for myself. Afterall, I've discovered a lot of new reduced calorie options over the years that merit the trade-off. Unfortunately, these noodles were just not worth it. The texture alone kept me from wanting more than two bites. Still hopeful, I mixed them together with spaghetti sauce and grated parmesean cheese and let them sit overnight in the frig (as sometimes the flavors can make it better the second day). Again, no luck. Just plain yucky. Maybe putting in soup would help change the rubbery texture??? Not sure but I won't be trying again anytime soon."
4,"Product is fine, shipping VERY slow",We were told the item would be delivered on or about February 16th and it wasn't actually shipped until March 6th. The information should be more accurate.Thank you!
1,horrible ups shipping procedures,"I rated this product 1 star because I never was able to try it. Ups put my package, that was not marked perishable, on my patio of my apartment. Since it is winter, I don't go out there. No note was left on my apartment door. The only reason I found it was because my neighbor noticed it and told me. It was spoiled and I feel that I either deserve a refund, or a redelivery of the product at no cost to me. I expect a prompt resolution to this problem. Rebecca Robins (407)694-6708"
3,Shirataki Noodles,"I ordered the noodles after seeing them profiled on the Oprah show. I bought them at $1.99 a bag, and even though the ordering process was easy, it took over three weeks for me to receive my order. I must compliment the shipping process as the 8 bags were packed with ice packs and arrived in a styrofoam container. The noodles were very fresh. My only frustration was the time it took to receive them. There was no indication that it would take that long when I placed my order."
2,"So-so product, VERY HIGH SHIPPING!","Be warned: Shipping is very expensive (at least $18). This is not indicated anywhere. You will be much better off trying to find a store that carries them.As to the noodles, they were OK. I tried them in a dish with a pesto-based sauce and shrimp. They don't taste too bad, but they didn't hold the sauce like pasta would. All the sauce slid down to the plate. They might work better in a different dish."
1,"Inferior Software, unconvincing company backup","With a bit of luck you will get the software working - and even print some business forms. For me, the system REALY fell apart when I tried to re-order business forms and envelopes. Save yourself a lot of trouble and frustration and look elsewhere."
5,EXCELLENT,"I purchased Clarence Emperado Luna's DVD, which GLANCES over Kajukenbo. This one DVD covers more in the first ten minutes than the entire film released by Luna and Empire media. Basics, kata, form application, self defense, and history of the martial art conveniently placed in a side menu so the more meat & bones practicioner can jump right into the techniques. I look to purchase instructional DVDs of various fighting styles which are not accessable to me, films never make up for quality instruction with a hands on teacher but certain films are better than others and this one is a vastly superior source of martial knowledge. I look forward to the enjoying the rest of the series"
5,For TOT Swingline and others that size,"Do you have a TOT (small staple) stapler? I am so happy (well, reasonably) that I took a risk on these -- sure enough, I now have multiple years' worth (at the pace I use them) of TOT-size staples."
5,Woohoo! Finally found mini-staples!,"I am so glad I found these mini staples to refill my little ""Tot"" stapler - the old kind that actually uses these smaller staples. The Swingline company that made the old version of the TOT doesn't even sell staples to fit these anymore! No one seemed to! And after a rather absurdly exhaustive search, I found these & ordered them. They arrived almost overnight. AND THEY FIT! Now I have enough to last another couple decades ;). But I might buy some more for posterity. I love that little stapler!"
3,Ok1,"About ten percent of the staples were damaged, needs better packaging to be shipped. A hard plastic container would be ideal."
5,They staple...,These staples are the real deal. Put them in a small stapler and hammer away.They bond paper like a champion loose paper has met its match.
3,"re-issue of George cartoons, but no Super Chicken or Tom Slick","Most of these cartoons have been issued before in the original 8 tape release of George of the Jungle. Unfortunately, this time it is only George. The better cartoons, Super Chicken & Tom Slick have not been included. I would suggest getting the original 8, the asking prices of the used copies reflects the popularity of those over these.THE GOOD NEWS: This tape is recorded in the SP quality mode!Tape includes:""Gold Mine,"" (aka Treasure of Sarah Madre from Vol.3)""Dr. Scrupritzer,""""Mr. Noodnick,"" (aka Kings Back to Back)""Ring-a-Ding Circus."" (aka Big Flop at the Big Top from Vol.7)"
4,Great painting advice,"Mr. Grado passes along the drawing and painting lessons of Frank J. Reilly,who taught at the Art Students League in New York. In the introduction, Mr. Grado says that ""many professionals in the art field saw [Reilly's] teachings as too 'mechanical' or 'methodical'"". The drawings seem especially stilted; nevertheless the information on painting is invaluable, if a bit ""methodical"".Personally, I will ignore the drawing advice and file away numerous gems on painting."
5,Little Bugler,"This was an excellent book, I grew up in Kearny & always love hearing about Gen Philip Kearny, had a teacher in Lincoln School named Mrs Kellerher who was the town historian & I remeber her telling us about the ""Little Bugler"" Looking forward to reading more books by this authorGreg H"
3,The Anointed Life,This is a good book. Makes a good inspirational book. If you want to deepen your faith in God this is a good book to read
5,Amazing bargain,"This volume is a collection of three novels by Anne Tyler: ""A Patchwork Planet"" of 1998, ""Ladder of Years"" of 1995, and ""Saint Maybe"" of 1991. Hardbound and durable, this volume is a better option for a reader who has started reading Anne Tyler, and even for the reader who already owns one or two paperbacks with novels contained in this volume. This volume is simply beautiful. Pleasant serif typeface, good, bright paper, nice cover artwork, and finally, amazingly low cost. You get three hardbound novels for a price of one paperback. In addition, all three novels of Anne Tyler belong to the more interesting subset of her literary heritage, so there is really nothing to be suspicious about here. Psst, do not tell anyone I have said that, but such bargains are possible only in North America. Nowhere else I would be able to get hold of three interesting novels combined in one hardbound volume for almost nothing. Do not hesitate, dear reader, and rush to purchase this collection. Now!"
3,It's smaller than you think.,I use this tool quite often and it works well. I initially thought it was slightly bigger. The only negative comment would be you cannot put more than a tbsp of anything in it as it will spill over the sides when you try to use it. Overall I'm satisfied.
2,good,"At $2 it's sort of worthless. It works, but barely holds any sugar in it so it's usually knocking sugar off the side rather than through the sifter. This is with confectioner sugar. Tried it with other spices too with the same result."
4,too small for sugar,"Cute little sifter, perfect for spices or for dusting a little cocoa on a cupcake. However, I think it is too small for powdered sugar, just does not function well for that. Same thing only bigger would be good for powdered sugar."
4,Nice little kitchen tool!,"I like this little spoon. It's handy to use to sprinkle powered sugar. Care needs to be used to wash and dry it immediately or it may rust. Don't overload the spoon when using, a little goes a long way and looks nicer. Tap the spoon over your index finger and it will sift quite nicely over the food you wish to have sprinkled."
3,"ADVANCED!!! Good book, but not for the average amateur","I do not consider myself to be technically lacking, however this book (informative as it was) is written for those in the higher levels of photographic sciences. If you don't have a good science background, or a knowledge of optics or physics, this book will be extremely difficult for you. Many of the technical terms required explanation, however they weren't. The majority of the charts and graphs were meaningless to me. I don't want to put the book down totally, there are some things that you could learn from it, however the fact that it is written in such highly scientific terms makes the book difficult for the average layperson like myself."
1,Spend more & Get a better ball,"I just received this item today and when I attempted to inflate the ball, the included hand pump broke into pieces almost immediately! That would not have been completely tragic, except the infill 'valve' for the ball only works with the included pump, ie. you cannot use a bicycle pump or other pump. Also, assuming I could have inflated the ball to its proper pressure, the valve is such that you must try and wrangle a plug into the ball after detaching the pump without any of the air escaping-nearly impossible. To make matters worse, rather than being ""tacky"" to the touch (so that the it doesn't slip around) the ball is almost greasy, and left an unpleasant sort of residue on my hands. All in all, a huge disappointment."
4,Decent Product,These sandals are decent for the most part. Fairly stiff and will fit Speedplay frogs. One thing I don't like about them is that they have three straps and are more closed than earlier models. I buy sandals because they are cooler than shoes but these feel closer to a shoe.
2,Toe Torture,"I wanted sandals for commuting - especially in the summer rain. My commute is short and most of my errands are 1-3 mile trips. But I liked the coolness of a sandal so much that I tried to use them on longer rides.I know so many people who swear by these things. They love them so much, they wear them year-round. I know an ultra-distance rider who wears them exclusively. How could I go wrong? I figured the redesigned upper would offer more support for long rides. It does. The problem is, the foot bed is miserably uncomfortable. It curves up steeply at mid-toe and pushes my toes backwards against their joints. After 45 minutes or so, my forefoot and toes begin to ache. Wearing them for several hours is excruciating and results in foot pain for hours after the ride is done."
5,Only Bike Shoes You Need,Love my Shimano bike shoes. Comfortable and adjustable. Pack light and only take one pair of shoes on you bike tours. They are very comfortable to pedal in or walk. You can use them as a casual shoe when not wearing your bike wear. The cleat is recessed so you don't feel it when walking. I'm on my second pair. First ones lasted 18 years.
1,copy of other story.,This is the same title that I read when I was only 11 years old. I am now 84. It was a terrific one and I wanted to read it again. The story in the book I received from Amazon was an entirely different story. Sorry.
1,don't waste your money,i had purchased this to be used by a disabled person and within a week on using the tubing for 3 minutes per day both sets of tubing snaped. if this product was used of someone who has been bedridden for months how quick will it break with an abled body person using it? this is the second product of this type i have purchased by everlast and the first one also snapped causing a welt on the face. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
5,Beautifully Mistaken,The best album I found this year. Linkin'Park's vocal combos seem diminished before these guys'. Every chord's in the right place.
2,"Boring, poorly organized","I only watched this video twice, i cant get past how boring she is. The techniques are ...nice. She's not detailed enough when she's explaining the movements. Its not well organized either, if I wasnt so busy I would've gotten my money back. But hey if Im bored one day I'll try it again. If I cant get into it by the third try then I'll get rid of it."
3,The ultimate guide for identification?,"I was a little disappointed when I finally got my copy, since I expected more based on the ads and the book's price. I can recommend this book for those collectors who want to have ALL the nice bird books, but a non-European would find it way too heavy to carry in the field, and citizens of almost every European country would find outdated (i.e 10 years old) information on the distribution of several species. Even the country boundaries are representing pre-1990 status in the Eastern part of Europe (Czechoslovakia does not exist as one country any more etc.). While two thumbs down for the distribution maps, the text is OK (although not free of mistakes, either) and the pictures range from mediocre to very good. If you are on a tight budget buy only Svensson et al's Collins Bird Guide (under a different title in the US though) for less than half of this book's price but has excellent pictures and a perfect size for your pocket."
3,Beautiful Scarves--Directions so-so,"If you are an experienced seamstress, this is a really nice book. There are many beautiful scarves in it, some with a lot of detail work.For the rest of us, (who take the machine out occasionally to mend with) the directions are rather confusing. Also, there are only a few scarves that aren't too dressy to wear with jeans for a walk in the park, so you are going to be spending some $$$$ to make most of these designs.I wanted to give this book three-and-a-half stars. Not for a beginner, but someone who really enjoys sewing would like this book, especially if they like to dress up--see if you can understand the directions first!"
2,Not a How To book!,"This books has lots of pictures of beautiful, well photographed scarves; but I was very disappointed in the lack of technical instructions. Even as a moderately experienced semestress, I thought the ""instructions"" glossed over the difficult parts. I found very little help given in this book on how to make a professional looking scarf."
1,Exceptionally poor quality,"I bought this set for the world map in the process of pining it to the wall, the map ripped constantly, it is very cheaply made. You're just as well off buying a paper version...."
1,"It's shame, I ordered it last month and still have to receive it.","How can I review a product which I never recived. It's not just fault of Vendor, it's fault of Amazon to list a product which takes years to come. I except that Amazon sent me email message, saying it will delay."
5,An absolute must,"This album is the epitome of classic Isley Brothers love music. It is missing some of the more popular tunes (Livin for the Love of You, Coolin' Me Out, Footsteps In The Dark) but trust, it more than compensates for it with songs which deservedly should have received much more air play. Classics like Lay Lady Lay and Hello It's Me are timeless. This is an absolute must for any Isley Brothers fans' repertoire of albums. No romantic evening is fully complete without Ronnie's smooth, silky lyrics ringing in your ears. A true pleasure."
5,I usually dont give out 5 stars!,"This album deserves 5 stars. I never knew they made all those hits. A lot of rappers and singers took their beats. I love this album, check it out."
5,The Isley Brothers- Beautiful Ballads,"I really enjoy listening to this cd. Like the Love Songs, most of the songs on the cd are great!The only 2 songs I don't like on here is ""You're beside me (Parts 1 & 2),"" and ""I once had your love (And I can't let go)"". The great tracks on here are:-Brown Eyed Girl-Hello It's Me-Let's Fall In Love-Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight-Make Me Say It Again Girl (Parts 1 & 2)-Choosey Lover-Lay Lady Lay-Don't Say Goodnight (It's Time For Love) (Parts 1 & 2)According to the sticker on the front cover, it says that this cd has 14 of the most romantic songs ever waxed! Therefore, you should get this cd!"
3,A Decent Overview of a Great Band,"As Greatest Hits/Best of cds go, this one is somewhat mediocre. To begin, the 14 songs don't even take up 60 minutes on the cd. The Hothouse Flowers have so many good songs that this disc should've been filled to the 79 minute mark. Nevertheless, the songs included are terrific, my major complaint being the absence of some of the truly fantastic material from ""Songs from the Rain""--especially 'Good for You' and 'Isn't it Amazing'. Overall, this cd is worth getting as an overview, but to begin listening to the Flowers, I would recommend starting with either ""Home"" or ""Songs from the Rain""."
5,Al Live?,I reticent to ruin my appreciation of Al's video offerings with this live DVD. BUT I was really happy to find that the quality of performance and recording has increased my appreciation of the King of novelty music. I really enjoyed this concert and the last piece is really not to be missed. 5 stars plus from me!
4,Al's the man!,"Al's second live dvd is a fun ride through his recent 'Alpocalypse Tour.' Includes songs from early in his career to a good dose from the latest cd. All the costume changes, audience interaction and crack musicianship from his long-time band is here. As someone who has seen him in concert multiple times, this is about as good as it gets. The only thing missing are the between song videos/ shorts that are played while the band is changing costumes, such as ' The History of Dirt.' I also wish they could have included his intro, which is always a montage of Al in various tv and movie appearances, but I suppose the licensing from those companies would be prohibitively difficult or expensive. Oh, well. The dvd also has a lot of extras, whether music videos (' Perform This Way'), other live songs ( 'Frank's 2000- inch TV)or Al's home movies. This is a good addition for the serious Al fan or a good intro for a casual one."
3,Be aware this is region locked to american players!,"It's not mentioned in the DVD spec listed on amazone but this bluray will NOT play on players outside the US region code (you get a region code message when you insert the disc). ie. it won't play on any player sold in Europe, and probably South America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. This is deeply dissapointing. I'm sure I'd love this concert if I could see it! Many blurays of concerts and things are intended for the world and aren't region encoded - it's a great shame that this is region coded."
5,Excellent and delicious... just like the title says!,"I actually bought this cookbook when my mother was diagnosed with diabetes, intending to give it to her. I made the mistake of flipping through it, and I just had to try a recipe or two myself! Boy am I glad I did, this is an excellent cookbook. I'm a total junk food freak, and loved the few recipes that I tried. However, I still gave the book to my mother... and now I'm thinking I should get me another copy!!"
4,Stalk the Skys,"I purchased this online from another company, and I'm very pleased with it so far. Assembly is slightly intricate, and there's a trick to getting the tail to stand straight (pass the tail rod left of the dorsal (top) spine and right of the ventral (bottom) spine and it will stand straight - else it flops over)I've flown it briefly in the park, and I can't wait to take it to the National Mall in Washington this summer...or the beach!"
3,Good...but,"Chapman is best when putting human faces on the drama of Creationism (aka ""Intelligent Design"") versus science during the now famous ""Dover vs Kitzmiller"" trial. For the most part, his sarcastic asides and obvious favoritism are balanced by genuine empathy and regard for those with opposing views. However, if you read only one book on the trial in Dover, it should be Edward Humes' ""Monkey Girl,"" which is the most informative and broadest in scope of the various available reports. Chapman is a fun read, and he certainly fleshes out the story, but he's a bit thin on some of the opening moves, and not as aware of the cultural significance of the trial as is Humes. Nonetheless, if you are truly interested in the trial and the ID controversy, you will profit from Chapman's account of the trial in Dover."
5,A unique view of the Kitzmiller V. Dover case,"When I heard that a descendant of Charles Darwin had written a book on Kitzmiller, I had to read it - and I found it thoroughly enjoyable. While Chapman's bias on the side of the plaintiffs is never in doubt, he describes the people on both sides of this case as the complex creatures that all human beings are. He injects a good deal of humor in his telling of the case, and he revels himself to be an excellent observer of people in this tense situation. Chapman is a fine author, and I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in this most interesting case."
3,Could have been better,Mediocre. Don't get me wrong... I'm a card carrying Darwinist... but the narrative could have been better. Too much Chapman's opinions and not enough actual facts of the case.
3,"A polemic, yet a very interesting topic","Chapman asks the reader in the introduction not to hold against him that he is a direct descendent of Charles Darwin, and indeed I have no reason to do so. But I do hold against him his unveiled contempt for many of the people he describes in this polemic of ""journalism."" I would like even less seeing through thinly veiled contempt and feeling swindled by a false cheer, and so I commend Chapman for his honesty. But I am far more comfortable with, and believe more is to be learned from, a genuine attempt at parlay and mutual respect which seems to fall quite outside Chapman's imagination.The formatting for Kindle is excellent -- searchable, with a great Table of Contents and a nice typeface. The topic, too, is fascinating. I wish only for a less biased account. Well, and I also wish to know what in heck MOB is appended to the title for."
2,"40 days and 40 nights, too many days and nights","I have not finished the book yet, but I am way over half way through and find the book tedious and boring. I expected the ins and outs of the courts proceedings, insted I found over 25 protagonists and antagonists in the book from PTA members, to shool board members to court officers. Chapman describes each of these characters' personalities, professions, education, family background, etc., and by the time the reader reaches the fourth protagonists the reader tends to confuse everybodys background. Tedious is the right word for it. Sorry, I thought it was going to be a legal intrigue. It was a biogrphical essay of over 25 people."
4,Think Fink!,One of the best Doc. movies ever! If you like rat fink this is a must DVD! This is on all the time at my house!
5,"If you are a Rat Fink fan, this is a must.","I grew up making the models, buying the T shirts and decals, so this was a must buy for me. I still look for Rat Fink T shirts when I go to any car weekend or event."
1,Big Daddy deserves better,"This Ed Roth bio is a total miscalculation from an otherwise fine documentarian, Ron Mann. Overkilled with lousy animation, insipid ""celebrity"" narration, faux archival footage and sound effects, the DVD disappoints on nearly every level. Hopefully, it'll be out of print fast enough to save Roth's friends and fans some embarrassment."
4,Tales of the Rat Fink,"The story of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth was quite interesting. To see how his creations came about with the Rat Fink, his car creations and the insite into his younger years.A must watch for all Ed Roth fans i believe they will find it quite interesting."
5,A Drag Race down Memory Lane,"I was a junior high school aspiring Rat Fink born in SoCal and living about 10 miles West of Maywood during the Roth era. Having been around car enthusiasts at the time we went to the car shows and saw Roth's creations. We built the Revell models and bought the T-shirts. We were the hippest. Later we built our own cars. This dvd is all about SoCal car/surf culture at its peak. Wherever car enthusiasts are cruising with their rides of glory and looking really crazy, the spirit of Big Daddy lives on."
4,Cool documentary,"I knew nothing about rat fink until I watched this. It is quite well done and informative on the history of Rat Fink and the creator, Big Daddy Roth. I recommend it for anyone into classic old cars, rat fink, entrepreneurs, people with dreams, artists, skateboards, surfers, etc."
4,Tales of the Rat Fink,"It was a gift to a friend for his birthday. He said he really liked it, it was good. The DVD was in good shape and had no problems with it."
4,Special guest star: Gamera!,"Most of this movie sets up the introduction of (then having to deal with) Barugon. Since Gamera is put on ice for much of the movie, he really only rates a guest star billing. That's okay; it's still a good monster movie. There's plenty of action and intrigue (a fake opal and an enormous diamond are featured in the plot: almost as much greed as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre). And then there are the pesky monsters to deal with (loved Barugon's rainbow effect). Surprisingly good, it's a keeper!"
4,Barugon's First Legal Region 1 DVD,"Following up their release of the first Gamera film, Shout! brings the original Japanese version of Barugon to the US for the first time ever. Video and audio quality are fantastic, and the extras are good as well, including a booklet, publicity gallery, and an informative audio commentary by August Ragone and Jason Varney. I give the DVD 4/5 stars for the lack of the English dub, but despite that, this is a fantastic DVD and should be in all kaiju fans' libraries."
1,CANNOT ACCESS THE SUBTITLES,"For reasons I don't understand, my player cannot show the subtitles. I keep getting a message: disc will not allow subtitles.Very disappointed."
3,Book spoke too soon on Neanderthals.,"It claims early in the book that no one today is descended from them. All we have are a few studies of MTDNA from neanderthal fossils. Ignoring any forgery posibilities concerning these Neanderthal DNA studies all they prove is that no (or almost) no neanderthal ladies had babies by Cro-Magnon men. The reverse scenario is still possible and even more so- likely. On other bits of the book, I don't know if it should have displayed (on the cover!)a quote from Monty Python alumni Terry Jones. Jones's lack of credibilty (for at least some) will certainly lower the book's value."
4,Consice and Easy to Read Gerontolgy Text,"I am privilaged to have the author, Dr. Crandall as my professor at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, MI. This text is consice and easy to read. Crandall gets to the point in an unbiased manner. As he would say it is a, ""Pretty good book."""
5,"George Shearing - ""Shearing on Stage."" - A TREASURE!","The tunes on this CD not only swing, they strut! The chemistry between Shearing and Emil Richards on vibes reminds me of that between Brubeck and Desmond. One of the most uplifting albums I have ever heard, it's a ""must have"" for all jazz fans. You can't help being in a good mood once you hear these tunes. I first heard this album in 1959 when I purchased the LP, if anyone remembers those. Now forty years later I have the CD and it's great!"
5,Superb Shearing quintet sound,"I consider this to be one of the finest George Shearing Quintet live performances ever recorded.This particular album has considerable sentimental value for me and is one that I had been searching for years until I finally obtained the CD. Even though his later live Quintet Capitol recordings are very good as well, I still consider this the best live GSQ recorded concert.Even the jacket cover(which is a photograph of the quintet on stage)lends itself to anticipate hearing the disc.An absolute definite must for all jazz and George Shearing fans."
3,Incorrect size,If only someone had mentioned that car lighters have different lengths I might have made sure this was the correct length.It's too short for my jeep so it does not stay in when pushed (but it does get hot). Otherwise it would have been perfect.
3,HELP LIGHTER,NICE LIGHTER - - TOO BAD YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT IN UNTIL IT WARMS UP. HOLD IT TOO LONG AND TOU WILL BLOW A FUSE.
5,Interesting Read,"Jaswant Singh has been on the forefront of Indian politics recently due to the Pokharan tests. He and Strobe Talbott periodically engage in discussions to improve Indo-US ties, etc.This book is extremely interesting because of his position and background."
3,Interesting but a little biased,The book is interesting but a little biased due to the political affiliations of the writer.Good read.
4,Awesome product with misleading photo...,"I love Persian Cold Wax and have been using it for years. Shipping was very fast, but I only received the wax and not all of the other items in the photo. Thankfully, I have them, but be warned that you will not receive them with your order."
5,Persian Cold Wax is the BEST!!!!!,This wax is the best. It is water soluble and gentle on your skin. I will only use this product!
1,Didn't work.,"I tried this wax in several places, I applied a thin layer like the directions recommended and then applied a strip, placed some pressure, and ripped off in opposite direction. The wax didn't come off just left a extremely painful and sticky residue. I'm dissapointed, if anyone has any tips, I'd appreciate it. For people who are thinking of buying, I say your taking a big chance that it won't work on you either."
4,Nice Watch,I bought this watch as a gift for my wife. She liked it very much and fit nicely as well. So far we didn't notice any problem with its internal time mechanism.
3,band does not stretch,"I love, love this watch but the band does not stretch which does not allow for a snug fit. I returned the watch,customer service was great. The watch is as beautiful as it looks. You have 15 days for returns. I would only recommend this watch if you are NOT looking for a close fit."
1,A little more info would help,"I don't own this video because there wasn't enough info for me to purchase it. It's a three pack, what are the three tapes? beginner, intermediate and advance aerobics or are two of them tonning? People don't want to buy something if they don't know exactly what they are going to get."
4,Good Performance and Design but not durable enough,"Read and write performance seems fine on this. The case looks durable but the keyring section is plastic and broke on me yesterday. The search for a USB drive that fits on a keyring and is actually tough enough continues. (So far I have been through Imation tough and tiny, PQI, HP v115w, and many other key chain flash drives. None has lasted longer than 1 year on my keychain. The HP v115w gets called the award for worst Flash drive for dying days after I purchased it.)"
3,"nice, but little big issues","i purchased three of these and i had to exchange two of them becase the covers keep coming of and the connector does not stay out when i push it into a usb port. on one of the replaqcement, i have problem again with thye cover comming off."
3,plastic is so brittle,"My purpose in buying this drive was for transferring files on occasion. The case and cover for the drive is garbage. The plastic is so brittle, thin and cheap that it is almost worthless.Technically the storage device is actually slow too."
1,Very Slow,"Of course the drive has large capacity. But it is the SLOWEST USB 2.0 flash drive I have ever used. It took over 2 hours to transfer 4 GB of small photo files from my hard drive to the JetFlash, with no other applications running in the computer"
1,Slow as mud. Don't buy for multimedia use.,"I purchased one of these about a year ago. The price for an 8MB Flash Drive looked like a fantastic deal at that time. The cliche ""You get what you pay for"" now comes to mind. I have owned at least six different USB drives over the last three years and this is by FAR the slowest of any of these many times over. 8MB is a lot of storage, but it takes FOREVER to write large files to this drive. I would strongly urge anyone considering this drive to spend the extra money for a faster high capacity drive if you will be copying large files to the drive on a regular basis. I regret trying to save money with this drive. It's really that slow."
2,VERY SLOW,"This USB flash drive may be cheap, but it is also very slow, especially for one so big. If you need to carry an incredible amount of data with you that you hardly ever access and almost never change, then this might be for you. But, for the average user, the manufacturer says: System Performance Read 10 MB/sec Write 2 MB/sec. This is very slow, compared to any modern high-performance drive. My OCZ Rally2 4GB has an impressive 23.8MB/s average read speeds, 14.8MB/s write speeds. The Corsair Flash Voyager GT is even faster at read speed of 33.8MB/s. So buyer beware!"
4,ranscend JetFlash V10 - USB flash drive - 8 GB - Hi-Speed USB - black,"This unit works fine, no problems with it. The shipping time was great too."
1,Wasn't as it said.,I bought the Hi Speed USB flash drive cause I thought it was high speed since the name said that.Instead it was very slow and took 1/2 hour to add files to it. I had to return it and bought a Corsair 8 GB USB 2.0 The specs. are: Write 34 MB/s Read 28 MB/s for about double the price but it is probably 4 X's faster.
2,Very fragile; bad design,"I have many flash drives with the same slide in and out design, and all but this one work perfectly. You have to hold the piece out and hope that while you insert it, it doesn't slide back in. If it weren't 8GB I would throw it away. (it would be wasteful)"
4,Transcend JetFlash V10 - 8 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive TS8GJFV10 (Black),"It performs well as a USB storage for my MP3 and jpg etc, great price for the USB storage purpose."
3,"Poor build quality, slow, but a good price.","This drive has a retractable USB connector. It feels like it will break any day. The plastic does not feel solid at all. The speed is not great. If you are transfer smaller files, you will most likely not notice the speed. Once you move to larger files it becomes a poor performer. My Patriot XT is much faster. I would only recommend this drive if you can buy it for under twelve dollars otherwise look at the kingston because the build quality is better."
3,Good storage bad design,"This flash drive works great on home computers. Could not get it to run at work even after speaking with IT. It slides out similar tod a switch blade, however it does not lock very securely so when you put it in the USB port it has a tendency to slide back into itself. If you can get past that minor annoyance it is worth the lightning deal price, definately wouldn't purchase one at full price."
2,Won't boot.,"You can't boot off of this device - and that's not anywhere in the specs. Still trying using the workarounds on the net. It's a shame, because it otherwise seems like a reasonable flash drive. Transcend's support web site could stand to be a whole lot faster, too."
4,great price for the size,"recently had a portable external hard drive crash so thought i should start having backups and use a jumpdrive for traveling to work, home, other computers, etc. this one works fine for both mac and pc (already formatted for FAT32)"
3,"Meh, it's alright","Following the Gold Box deals closely enough, I decided to take a chance on this to have a little more storage to carry around(before I'd only been using a 2gig). It's not like it doesn't work... though I haven't had it quite long enough to see if it's going to start mysteriously eating up my files or anything. The reviews are pretty accurate though, it is pretty much a flimsy piece of plastic. The port retracts into the drive and tends to stick when I try to cover it back up, and trying to force it just makes it feel like it wants to break. Plus the write speed isn't blazing fast for sure, but I'm not often in too much of a hurry to care either way. For the price I'm definitely glad I got it, but it's not a high end item for sure."
5,Does the Job,"I've been using the flash drive for close to a year, and have had no problems. I find that the speed is quite acceptable. At the current price level as of Dec, 2008, they are a real bargain."
2,Slow!!,I have a number of flash drives including the 2gb Transcend... This 8gb model is the slowest of any of my drives..It is easily 10-20x slower than a just average speed 8gb Sandisk... What a disappointment..!!
4,DJ Escape - Rocks!,This compilation is pretty good. I have others from DJ Escape that are better but this one keeps you interested throughout.
2,"Great idea, not-so-great book","I was disappointed in this book. It makes a great argument for how to lower the abortion rate in America and help women heal. However, the subject does not require hundreds of pages. It has one point and it makes it, clearly, but then, like many other books I researched on this subject, it spends pages saying the same thing in many different ways."
3,Mediocre,Was surprised to see all of the glowing reviews here. I always loved Ode to Billie Joe so thought I would give this a try. There is a reason she is a one hit wonder - the rest of this stuff is ok but really not very good.
1,Not for a Sherlockian or a Holmesian,"I agree with the previous reviewer, and would have assigned this book a negative rating if it were allowed. If you are a true devotee of Sherlock Holmes, this is NOT the book for you. Millett may have knowledge of Canonical lore, but he has no understanding of the characters Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Watson, nor does Millett exhibit any understanding of the Victorian morals and principles that these two men would have been steeped in.As for me: after reading only 6 chapters of this book, I gleefully used it as tinder in my fireplace. That should speak for itself."
5,everyone wants a magic pill,"Lazy people are probably expecting an easy answer where thy take some herb and they are no longer fat or sick, true health requires more than than, this book covers all the REAL reasons USA is ""sick"" and the lifestyle changes required to be truly healthy, do not be lied to any longer and READ THIS BOOK!"
1,"Thanks reviewers for preventing me from ""Buying the Book that HE Wanted Me to Buy.""","You know how a salesman will flinch when he knows he just spread a layer of BS? I was skeptical when Kevin flinched on the infomercials each time he mentioned the $40 value for his newsletter, and the secret title of the ""Weight Loss CD."" I almost bought the book because my girlfriend's mother has diabetes plus a few other things mentioned. Thanks you for saving my time and money. I'll look elsewhere for natural cures. ...the government took Calcium away from him...NICE TRY!!"
1,This book does NOT give natural cures,"After buying the book for a total of $33.43 I read on page 250 Kevin can not give the natural cures advertised, but if I spend more money to join his private website he will give the information. So many complained according to his customer service he wrote a second book and supossedly listed cures.The Better Business Bureau in Chicago has many complaints under his name. DON""T GET TAKEN BY BUYING THIS BOOK!"
3,Great Book... with Problems,"I think Kevin Trudeau is an excellent writer and speaker. This book is well-written and informative - giving useful life-style suggestions and backing his data up nicely. The problem - ""Come join my website and pay me $10 a month and I'll tell you even more ESSENTIAL information"" (paraphrased, not a real quote). This is equivalent to ""Come to my religion and get salvation FREE of charge, but now you need to SIGN UP and give me 10% of your gross income."" My question - so what was free? Concerning the book I bought for $35 - Now you want $10 a month to tell me what I REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW WHEN I PURCHASED THE BOOK??? Don't get me wrong - the book is good, and probably worth the price. If you are wealthy, you can join the club now and get the secret, dynamic, and essential inside scoop! WooHoo!"
1,Gettin' Deep In Here,"Just because I had the sheer joy of reading a copy someone else bought, I had to post something about this fraud. If you've seen the infomercial, you've read the book - plain and simple. [...]Personally, I'd rather die fat and happy with a cheeseburger in one hand and a triple chocolate milkshake in the other. For the rest of you, keep hitting the treadmills and don't eat more than you can stomach. There is no miracle and no one recovers from snake oil."
1,SWEET GARBAGE!!!!!!!,Kevin Trudeau is amazing.He's one of the greatest rip-offartists of our time.Watch as Kevin Trudeau skillfully misleads you and takes you for as much money as he can.There hasn't been a scammer this awesome since John Beckor Robert Allen.His bull-#$%t skills are unmatched andhis uncanny use of unsupported facts are a joy to behold.Kevin Trudeau has helped thousands to be ripped off andhe can help you to.Kevin Trudeau's book has disappointed and mis-representeditself to thousands of readers.It has deflated theexpectations of people across America and youcould be next!Experts and critics are raving about Kevin Trudeau'scontinued ability to scam and lie.Kevin Trudeau is a legend in his own time!!!!
2,Save your money,Not up to speed. I thought there would be more cures and good information about we're one can go for cures.Wish I spent my money else where...
1,Scam!,"Much of what this book says was stolen from other books written in the late 80's to early 90's. See for yourself who this ""author"" Kevin Trudeau really is. Copy and paste this recent news story in your browser..[...]YouTube his name and you'll see just how fraudulent this guy really is! Don't be fooled!!!"
1,Natural Cures They Don't Want you to know about,I did not find the book as interesting as I thought it would be and will probably not read all of it.
1,I would have rated it zero if that had been an option.,"First off let me say that I don't disagree with all the ""cures"" in this book. But I do disagree with the title spouting about natural cures but only about 15% is dedicated to actual information on this while the rest is just him whining about the ""govt"" and how they are out to get him. This book is a waste of money. I recommend going to your library and taking the information you want and researching that. After some good researching and desiding go do what you want. I would also advice writing a book too about your opions and research into the subjects because if this idiot yet marketing genius can make thousands off naive and guilable people so can you."
1,Turd!,"it seems as though kevin trudeau belongs in either prison or a mental institution. to all these people who ask if we read the whole book. well i would have rather pet a porqupine than read this entire book. kevin trudeau is a worthless scoundrel who exists to do one thing only...scam people. he has done it all his life and is continuing it still. the ""natural"" cures he has come up with could have been pieced together by a group of african monkeys. i suggest to amazon to stop pedaling this nonsensical trash and remove mr. trudeau from there website. 30 dollars that i would have preffered to number 2 on and consume....a definite not buy"
1,What a crock o poo!,"Nothing in this book represents anything medically sufficient to print.It's all either 'bayou' medicine, or common sense crap.And don't refer us to your webpage for anymore garbage.Check out ""One Wounded Soul"" for a real book. It's on amazon too, but a felon didn't collect it from tabloid cut-outs."
5,"If this book is not needed, then why",Are the Doctors offices and pharmacies always jam packed and why are Americans getting sicker and sicker and sicker and sicker???Hmmmmm?? Inquiring minds want to know.
1,Looney Tunes,"This guy is living in cloud cuckoo land. He should have one of his daily colon cleansing rituals performed on his brain instead of his re**um.He gets one star only because there is no zero and OK, maybe there is some truth in some of the things he says and/or advocates."
5,Can you live to be 150?,Kevin Trudeau explains in this book how dogs can double their lifespan just by switching from the junk that we are told to buy for them to organic foods. Think what that can do for us!
2,Kevin is a Money Making Machine,"I listened to parts of his Audio Book and he must have said at least 50 times to go to his website sign up, spend some money so that you can get the exact brand of the stuff he's using to stay healthy...Also, in the second book he recommends using Hydrogen Peroxide and DMSO. Although they could be effective products, they are not exactly natural.To his credit, this book did inspire me to read other more credible material. I'm highly glad that I didn't spend a lot of money on his regurgitation of other people's work."
3,Good but repetitive,"This book is quite long and could be shortened by having less repetitions; however, I do understand the author's intent on drilling his message into your brain. The basic premise repeated over and over is ""Our bodies heal us, not drugs. Humans create the diseases we suffer from. Science is not better than nature."" Basically, your body is full of toxins coming from the environment and food supply. We hold too much emotional or mental stress inside. Too much electromagnetic chaos causes our diseases, and our lack of nutrition causes our immune systems to weaken."
1,Consider the source....No new information here.,"I give this book one star for content, but 5 stars on ability to scam people. If all the 5 star reviews were real, we'd be in real trouble. Can all you people be so gullible? He is doing the same thing as the drug companies are doing, ripping you off for his capitalistic pleasure. He is not dumb,he knows how to hook and reel in his victims. Much of the the information is correct and publicly available in many books, although it is hard to find in his. Some of his suggestions are dangerous. Find a reliable source for this information, Kevin Trudeau is FAR from reliable."
1,WHY BOTHER WRITING A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE REVIEW???,"This book is extremely misleading and as such isworse than puke.But the author and his cronies already won,it'sa National best-seller,why are there people whobother to give reviews saying it sucks(which itdoes)its not working.THEY ARE STILL MAKING MAJOR CASH!!??????????????"
1,An observation,"I haven't read the book, no intention of throwing away my money. I was just curious because I saw a news report on this guy and his troubles with the law. He is a real huckster. I looked at the first twenty people who gave him five star reviews; of those twenty only two had written reviews for other books. So what are the chances those reviews are genuine? You decide. The other thing you have to watch for is how they viciously attack the negative reviews. Me thinks they complain too much!"
1,Hey charlatan,"Trudeau you're featured on The Smoking Gun today. Guess there goes the franchise, huh? The only thing you seem to be an expert on is making bank. Go back to 3 card monte,mmmkay?"
1,Don't waste your money,Most worthless book...ever. In the history of mankind. Better to burn your money than to give it to this scam artist.
5,G'day Trudeau - good book,"Hello Trudeau. I'm an Aussie and just read your book - terrific stuff! Packed with information, personal stories and recommendations based on what appears to be some pretty tight research. I hope you get down to Australia to do some television appearances so I might get the chance to meet you mate! Good day; good book."
2,.,"Cancer will never be cured because too many people make profits from cancer research.If this has shocked you this book is worth the read but those of us who wear tin foil hats can live without it. The funny thing is, the last half of the book is a lot like the diet books Trudeau spent the first half arguing against."
3,Somewhat interesting,Bought this out of curiosity. I really did not find anything that was mind blowing. The author is not a doctor and the whole paranoia concept of us against them is really a marketing tactic. I gave the book away.
3,"No Rating, only MY opinion","Ok, I can only say this about his book. If you actually read it with an open mind, and can get through the repeating sentances and get to the parts he talks about how to be healthier, you will like his book. If you walk into this book with your own thoughts that cannot be changed, then don't read this book.People here with their reviews that are negative are only pin-pointing parts of the book. They don't tell you the whole picture. There is one person that says you have to be rich to do what he says. It is true you have to be rich to do EVERYTHING Kevin says, but somethings Kevin says are not expensive to do, and if you try even one thing, you most likekly would notice changes in your body.The only thing I can say about this book that I don't like is that he repeats the same sentances over and over. If you can get through the repeatativeness you might actually like this book.I have no opinion if this is a good or bad book."
5,Recommended for all,It surprised me to find a whole chapter in this book that took the things he wrote about and gave other books to read about it. How unselfish! I found this to be very helpful in areas I wanted more information on.I feel what is good about this book is the many things he touches on and gives someone like me an idea of what I can do to get healthier. I really do feel this book has helped many people become interested in alternatives and is helping this whole field as well as other authors. Now I have read some books I didn't even know existed until I read this book. That has helped me move to a whole different level and I think that is what this book is all about.Kevin Trudeau is to be commended that he was able to reach so many people.
1,False Advertising!,"I ordered this because it is advertised as a book about natural cures. All kinds of ailments are talked about in the advertisement. NOT ONE CURE IS IN THIS BOOK. NOT ONE. The guy must love to hear himself talk because for hundreds of pages all you read about is how smart he is and how he figured out BIG SECRETS but if he actually tells you --you know, as advertised-- he will be killed or something. It's very dramatic, and totally not useful. I am amazed this book has over 1000 positive reviews."
1,LIES LIES LIES,"terrible terrible... i read most of the jibber jabber in the book that was just complaining about our government and yada yada yada.... i am a pretty ""cheap"" kinda person but i went as far as spending over $200 for some sharco stuff that is suppose to just give you good health and cure you of all these pemamanent diseases... they said they guarntee you will not get for a year with just taking one sharco thing.. yeah i was sick the very next week and a few times after that i tried even using some other remedies... also did NOTHING... this guy has made so much money by doing nothing but giving up peoples hopes... i think its very very SAD SAD and CRUEL..."
1,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't want You To Know About","Please do NOT waste your money on this book! The author talks about others bilking the public out of money, believe me this book does the same. There are NO cures in the book! Possibly, he give some information, IF you spend extra money on his newsletters or his website. This man should be in jail instead of selling books. I am a retiree and have wasted my money on what I thought would be a book to help a friend of mine with a serious illness. WRONG!"
5,Cholesterol down 75 pts. Thanks Kevin!,The advice in t his book did more good for me in three weeks than listening to my family doctor did over the last three years.Great advice. Thanks Kevin.
1,Con Artist,"The ""Today Show"" featured a clip on this guy and he is a total fraud. He is not a doctor or any type of medical specialist. He is a convicted conman and some of his ""natural cures"" are potentially dangerous!! Do not waste your money on this book."
4,Great INFO...,"Lots of information to take in and learn (could be overwhelming). But, changes can be made in your life to improve your health if your willing to slowly make changes in your 'routine' of what you eat.. habits etc. The book is a EYE opener.1) Don't trust FDA2) Don't trust Food industry3) Don't trust Government to take care of your 'health care needs'as they will care for their wallet 1st.CAREFUL who you trust w/ your health. In many ways your responsible, don't depend 100% on anyone but yourself..then seek assistance for health care providers. Be careful to trust MD's who may be getting kickbacks from Pharmacy reps/drug companies etc. I SUGGEST THE BOOK as a learning tool, 4 stars."
4,Great buy,"Love this book. Bought it used, appreciated the wear and notations. It let me know that the book was well work reading and taking notes from"
2,This book is not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this book. I could not afford all the things he said to do. Very unreasonable for me. There was nothing in this book I could afford to use. The weight loss part (what a joke) I will just do it another way or be overwieight the rest of my life. Don't eat this don't do that only buy organic sugar, stay away from white flour, etc............I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they had a lot of money to throw away!!!"
4,I now know!,"I am particularly interested in the chapter in Natural Cures called ""Never get sick again."" I have believed in alternative medicine for a long time but have never found a resource that suggest exactly what to do and where to go to never get sick again. This is vital information for anyone to have and worth the price of admission. Lots of really great ideas here."
4,Good Ideas,A friend recommended that I read Natural Cures because I've been looking for answers to handle my fibromyalgia. Finding a doctor that doesn't want to cram pills down my throat has been difficult so I've been reading books like this to get new answers that make more sense. This book has some great answers.It is very informative on many levels. He seems like a straight shooter. I'm happy to have this as a resource.
2,Not worth the free shipping,"This book isn't worth the Super Saver free shipping Amazon has to offer. Save that for other items. While I agree that the FDA and drug companies aren't telling us the whole story and only care about the money, Trudeau's book doesn't do much more than tell us that over and over. With every natural cure he mentions, he also refers to his pay-to-join website to get the details, or even a brand name for distilled water and vitamins! I did find some seemingly helpful suggestions, but overall, I felt ripped off. I suggest finding this information elsewhere."
1,"lots of hype, where's the proof?","A friend gave me this book to review, and unfortunately, I can't say a lot of good things about it. I am very interested in natural health, but this seemed like a long rambling diatribe without substantiation. With good solid reseach and references, I wouldn't mind the fact that he can't write about certain subjects. But most often, I found myself thinking, Who says?"
1,"A total, absolute joke.","Ever wonder who ""Alliance Publishing"" (the group behind the producing of this book) truly is? It's a curious thing. The others have also hinted at, what is the bottom-line of this book: this idiot is only after one thing, and it's not helping you live to be 150. It's your hard-earned cash, first by getting you to shell out for this sensationalist, John Birch Society inspired book. Then, it's your CONTINUING to get your hard-earned cash by saying, well, I can only truly let you know the secrets to life and living by getting your yearly memberships to my website. Cha-ching - $$$$. Yeah, what ""HE"" doesn't want you to know is how green his garden grows with your cash-flow.Do your self a favor - avoid this snake-oil idiot like the plague."
3,The book was good,"The book was good but it left out important information. In order to get that information you had to go and purchase a monthly or lifetime membership for a website. I purchased the book after watching him on a TV show telling how the book had loads of information to cure certain things. When I purchased the book I found in order to get the information you had to go to the website. He talks in the book how everthing is all about money, money, money. Then he is not giving information up until you spend more money on his website. I found it to be quite deceiving."
1,Book Bad People,"This book is full of many same pages of same things said over and over again and again. Worse yet, it lacks clairty and the information is so undetailed and often times I found quite ambiguous for it to be of any genuine help.Worst of all was that to find the real cures alleged being offered in the book in the first place, readers are directed to go to the Trudeau website, where the reader will have to dish out as much as $499 for a membership to gain access to Kevin Trudeau's lifetime membership to these newsletter that supposedly contain cures.If the newsletters are anything like this book, however, the content will mostly be an almost tirade-like bashing of the government's FDA and the FTC.Save yoru money people and warn others about this.I found no benefit in this book whatsoever."
1,Should have been named,"Kevin is a good talker and saleman. There are NO CURES in the book at ALL. Please save your money. I bought the book because of the title and thinking it had natural cures in it..NONE TO BE FOUND. He wants you to go to his website and lay out more money, (...). If you go to the web site there is NO EMAIL address to write if you have a question. Save your money folks, I wish I would have!!BillSt. Louis, Mo."
1,Kevin Trudeau should be selling swamp land in Florida,"I was so intrigued with Kevin Trudeau's ""infomercial"" that I couldn't get my Visa card out fast enough to purchase his book. I was really pissed off when I realized that you had to spend MORE money to actually get to what ""they"" didn't want you to know about. Sound confusing? You bet.Now here's a real tip. If you're in the market for a book that contains actual information on naturopathic or homeopathic remedies for a variety of ailments, etc. then don't buy this book. Instead, purchase ""Prescription for Nutrional Healing"" -- you'll thank me later."
1,Not what I was expecting.,"Well, the title of my review pretty much says it all. Rather than actually being helpful. The book seems to be more just filled with helpful (by the author's standards) suggestions and opinions. I didn't find it to be helpful at all."
1,Dianetics & Scientology,The writer loses all credibililty as soon as he mentions the Church of $cientology's scam as a natural cure. Don't waste money on this book.
1,Scam. The 5star reviewers got paid to make his book look good,A con artist. He actually paid people to write fake positive reviews for him to cancel out the legit negetive ones that are on Amazon.com. Main reason why it's a 4 star book.
1,NATURAL CURES,"[...] The book contains references to other books (by Kevin Trudeau)and website URLs that don't work. Though none of the advice will hurt you, it also won't cure what ails you. Mr. Trudeau rails against the pharmaceutical industry but offers no treatment for common ailments like arthritis."
1,The TRUTH that Kevin Trudeau doesn't want you to know...,"He's out to make money folks...plain and simple.Readhttp://www.salon.com/books/feature/2005/07/29/trudeauand make sure you get the day pass so that you can read the entire article.A lot of smoke and mirrors, but no promised 'cures' here. Be forewarned.Oh, and anyone want to buy my used copy real cheap? :)"
1,A real con artist,"First there was the Ginsu knife that could cut through cans...then the hair trimmer you hook to your vacuum cleaner...now this, a book loooooooooong on promise and almost completely devoid of substance. A thousand negative reviews don't lie! The lessons: Stay away!! And never try to buy your good health from an infomerical!!!!"
1,"Protected by Freedom of Speech, the Felon Makes Good","This book is a brilliant scam. The informercial hints that the book will tell you secrets, the book tells you to go to his website for the secrets, and the website costs a bunch of money to access the secrets. Meanwhile, his information is commonly available for free elsewhere. And much of it is bunk.I did a google.com search on the author. You'll discover that he is a convicted felon who spent time in prison and has bought his way out of lots of trouble with through assorted settlements. He was blocked from doing infomercials for fraud. His brilliant solution was to stop selling fraudulent products and start selling fraudulent words, because free speech is protected under the constitution."
1,disappointment,"yes, there is advice that seems sound and natural. but one of the things that came across from kevin trudeau was 'DO NOT TRUST PEOPLE WHOSE ONLY OBJECTIVE WAS TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF ILLNESS.' and i believe that. so imagine my shock when a number of natural cures had to be found via a newsletter 'sold' for either a monthly fee or a 'lifetime' fee of almost $500!!!! i was very disappointed and i realize that mr. trudeau taught a valuable lesson: he's right. do not trust people whoe only objective was to make money off of illness. i'm sorry to say i believe he IS one of those people."
5,Saw Turdeau's informercial and just bought it at Wal Mart!,"After seeing Trudeau on tv, I got really excited. This guy speaks from the heart. He is like a Ralph Nader for health, wellness and nutrition (perhaps Trudeau should run for President in 2008) So honest. So humbly and kindly working for the consumer. Got to love this guy.So I got on the horn and called my local Wal Mart. They said they had it. I ran down and bought it! WOW! This book is awesome. So revealing!Now I can see why the drug and food companies have so many paid shills and paid Trudeau-bashers on this board.Great book and remember, no matter what time it is, you can always run down to a 24 hour Wal Mart and buy it. This stuff is too good to wait for. Save on shipping and handling too.Thanks Kevin. May the Lord Bless Your kind heart."
1,"Dangerous, irresponsible and reprehensible.","This book is unacceptable. Trudeau claims that sun exposure doesn't cause cancer, sunscreen does!!!! His other claims are similar BS. Following Trudeau's advice can literally kill you.Trudeau is willing to put your life on the line to line his pockets. Don't let his charm cause you harm, don't trust this book.Trudeau is a convicted con artist and still a fraud."
2,Fanatic or Savior?,"I personally think this author has an axe to grind with big business and is using unsuspecing people looking for a way to take care of themselves to accomplish it. How can an average Joe afford to buy the kinds of food he says we would have to eat to become truly healthy. All organic, no pasturization, nothing that is manufactured by big business; please give me a break. Yes processed foods and convenience has gotten out of hand, but you can be healthy without going to extremes. I do believe that drug companies don't want to hear about holistic healing and natural cures because they would loose money, but you can't go over the edge the other way either. Do your best to eat well and exercise and have a positive outlook on life. You will live as long as the supreme being sees fit. I feel robbed for the price of the book."
5,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About","I think people should read this book because this book is very interesting, helpful, and useful for all age groups especially people who want to keep or become heathly. This book can help!!!!!"
1,Save your money!,I purchased this book hoping to learn some 'natural cures' to some everday problems facing people today. I learned that Kevin Trudeau is after our money just as much as the FDA and pharmaceutical companies that he goes on and on about in the book. Save your money!
4,cancer,"As a patient with metasized breast cancer, and acid reflux disease (not caused by the cancer), I would like to say that none of the information that is contained in this book is medically relevant to ""cures"" for any cancer or acid reflux. I personally have done much research into the biological activities of cancer cells, and what is contained in the book is not only innaccurate, but inappropriate for the treatment of cancer. I am fortunate enough to have an oncologist who speaks to me with respect and gives me resources to increase my knowledge. Please consult with your oncologist as soon as possible if you are diagnosed with any of the many diseases classified as cancers. They are all frightening. They can all be death dealing. Some people are lucky and become chronic cancer patients in this day and age. What is contained in this book is not good medicine for any cancer patient."
5,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You to Know About","Nine years ago, with persuasion, I tried a natural product through a multi level company. I never had success with my business, but the business kept me on the product. My health kept getting better. Then I became confused. Why didn't more people know about products like these? So I researched and found out a bit of what Kevin presents in his book. You won't believe this but more then nine out of ten people I sold my product to said something like this; ""It's been a while since I've taken this product and I feel fine now and I certainly did not feel anything from this product"". Surprise, you most likely have a drug mentality to. You must read this book. Don't listen to anyone but yourself when it comes to your health. Doctors make great surgeons and good drug dealers. If you rely on what you experience and research, you may need to learn research, you can make it. If you listen to others, you will fail. Good luck.PR"
1,Save Your Money-You Don't Want To Know About This Book,"Kevin Trudeau's ""Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About"" is one of the poorest written books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Trudeau offers none of the cures within-you have to join his online club to get them-because ""they"" won't let him publish them in book form. From nauseating grammar and sentence construction to ridiculous blanket statements without a shred of supporting evidence to an eonic list of Howard Hughes-esque/Bubble-Boy preventive measures to stay healthy, you can't escape the feeling of simply being had; and since the type of reader purchasing this book may very well have health concerns and problems, Trudeau's irresponsible and overpriced ""book"" borders on something criminal."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"I just wasted my money on this book and I am trying to avoid anyone else from getting ripped off. He has very little useful information in this book. His so called cures are NOT told in this book. You have to go to his web site Natural Cures. com to find the answers to his secrets. Once you get there, you have to join at 9.95 a month to get his so called secrets to his so called cures. Save your money and DO NOT BUY this book. It is useless information and he is getting rich. I warned you."
1,Don't fall for it!!!,"Giving this book one star is generous. You would think by the title that there would be a list of cures ""they"" don't want you to know about. There is no such list. According to Trudeau, that chapter was censored by the U.S. government. So he offers a link to his site to get the list, but you must register at a cost of $9.95 per month. Once you do that, you'll find that there is still NO SUCH LIST. That section is ""under construction"". Who's the most corrupt here - the government or Trudeau?! On his site, Trudeau promises to personally respond to emails, but I have yet to receive any ackowledgement to my complaint. According to an automated response, he is temporarily away and unable to respond for a few weeks. I have to give him credit for suckering me out of my money, but I'll do what I can to spread the word. Don't waste your money! This guy's a thief!!!"
1,Book is a Waste of Paper and Money,"There are absolutely no natural cures in this book. According to kevin he can't actually give out the natural cures because if he did the Government would ruin his life. Yeah, well, why in the Hell are you selling a book claiming it has a bunch of natural cures in it then? I spent about 10 minutes browsing through this book before I realized it was worthless and I had been ripped off and I repacked it, returned it and got my money back. It took about a month to get my money back. And I had to call them several times and bother them. Here is the whole book in few sentences. You've probably heard this before. The pharmaceutical companies are all conspiring together to supress natural and alternative medicine. Which may very well be true. However you don't need more than 200 pages to say the same thing over an over again. And not offer any sort of evidence whatsover. Take care, Bob."
1,natural cures you still won't know about,"I'm glad kevin feels passionately for what he believes in but he is not giving you anything in this book that you didn't already know, except if you want more info you have to join his website and pay a montly fee. Anyone else can write health books and give their opinion but appartently the FTC won't let kevin talk and his book is more of a complaint and crusade against the FTC.He's a businessman trying to make money. His mega memory course is very good and it works. All the other infomercials are brialliantly misleading. refunds on the book are hard to get."
1,This book does help!,"This book will improve your health! Buy it, and there's thirty bucks you won't be able to spend on crack or donuts.Of course, Amazon's reduced price makes the book somewhat less effective."
1,Scientology Propaganda Completely Disingenious!!!,"First of all, all of Mr. Trudeau's so-called ""natural cures"" have been known and touted within the Holistic community for many years now. Kevin Trudeau is out to make a buck plain and simply evidenced by the fact that he references his website for additional information which can only be accessed if you are willing to pay a fee. Additionaly, Mr. Truedeau does not embody the complete picture of health. He appears to be slightly overweight with a bloated face and double chin. Clearly that is not from healthy diet & excercise.This book is pure propaganda to promote Scientology/Dianetic ideology!!"
1,Your health is way to priceless for this garbage,"We all have to get real with our health, this is really the only priceless gift we haveCheck Kevin Trudeau out on Wiki and if you are really interested in good books that dont cost a left shoe and a quart of blood, check out Mikhail TombaksNo fancy fees for internet access, shipping etc., just the $15 or so dollars for the cost of the book"
1,Natural marketer,Much good advice but this man is a self interested marketer. None of the info is organized in a table of contents or index and when you do find your problem you are steered to his website which then charges 9.95 PER MONTH to access the cure. You will be MUCH better off with the Phyllis Balch book Encyclopedia Of Nutritional Healing which describes the maladies and what may help cure them. Do yourself a favor and don't give this shameless marketer your hard earned bucks.
1,A book written by the world's greatest con artist!,"If you ever wanted to know how to be a lying decietfull, scumbag, then this book is for you! Learn from the best con artist in the world as he skillfully tries to rip every last penny out of your pocket with his bare hands!As far as natural cures though, there are none. Just rambling incoherent conspiracy theories and lots of links to his 100$ a month fee website."
1,WHY BOTHER?,This book is a waste of time. I expected that I could find a specific problem and find a specific answer to said problem. That wasn't the case in this book. The internet provide better solutions to medical questions. Don't waste your money.
1,Don't bother,I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for specific answers and it was mostly rethoric.
1,Save Your Money,"The author goes on and on about the FDA & the drug administration throughtout the book. He doesn't give you his so-called remidies - he tells you to go to a web site for that information. There, in order to find out anything, you have to pay $9.95 just to gain access.Sorry folks. This is just another money making pitch with no real help. Keep your doctor."
1,Absolute waste of time,This must be the biggest waste of paper in the history of publishing. Please do not buy this book!
1,Can't whitewash a leopard's spots,"I borrowed the book from the public library to determine if the negative reviews are justified. They are. In the following I've tried to be dispassionate in explaining why this is so.1) The book is poorly written.2) It gives no definite ""cures"", simply refers one to another of his books.3) Does Trudeau's background tell us he is qualified to make judgements on health, nutrition and other matters dwelt upon? Has he a medical degree? A degree in nutrition? In chemistry, perhaps? He has no degree, never having set foot inside a university. What is his occupation? He's been a salesman since the age of eighteen.[...]"
1,Don't waste your money..,"I just want to say that i did not buy this book or even look at it thankfully.I keep seeing Kevin Trudeaus informercials on TV, and was curious to know if his book actually says anything about actual cures well after reading all the reviews, its obcvious it doesn't.As usual its another scam just to get peoples money...well shame on Mr Trudeau.But thank you too all of you, now i won't waste my money on something that doesn't say anything."
1,Natural cure- look at the buteyko method,"This book is a waste of time. The author Trudeau has been banned for making infomercials due to the misleading and fals claims.One therapy has provided me with a natural cure for asthma. It is simple, makes sense and has no misleading selling. Do your research on the Buteyko method. There are also self help books available. This therapy should be in Trudeaus book but there would be not enough monetary gain.If you want something significant - read Close Your Mouth"
1,scientology,Mr. Trudeau recommends Dianetics & Scientology in his book. Refers to no other faith for healing. Seems he shares the same beliefs as Tom Cruise. I wonder if being a Scientologist makes you beleive you are also an expert on medicine.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"This book in my opinion is a rip off.Although there are a few pieces of useful information the majority of the book is worthless.I spent $30.00 for a book that refers you to websites that cost you to get the information that you thought you were getting in the first place.I feel Kevin Trudeau's informercials should be banned from being viewed.There is another book out there that is much better and actually does give cures for all these diseases that Kevin's book says it does,but doesn't.P.Boyer"
1,Deeply Disturbing,"I am deeply disturbed after reading this that it is on the best seller list. Unfortunately, I concur with the vast majority of other respondents that this book does not give any meaningful information or insight in to natural cures.Not having been familiar with Trudeau prior to picking up the book, I had no idea of his reputation as such a shady businessman. No wonder he dislikes the FTC so much they have had to ban him from making such outrageous claims about the myriad of products he sold. If curious go to www.ftc.gov and search on Turdeau. The number of results is pretty amazing.There are better books on the market that promote alternative health care and living healthy. Don't make the mistake I did and purchase this book and make this con man even wealthier. It is appalling how this man has preyed about people's fears."
2,Spells out the Truth but offers ZERO CURES!,The infomercial is nonsense. He spells out zero cures in this book but does shed light on the greed in the system. Problem is that he is part of the greed by shoving us a book that promised something it doesn't deliver.
1,Kevin Trudeau is a Fraud,"This guy copped a plea with the Federal Trade Commission, and as a result of a history of misleading infomercials, the FTC decreed the following:Trudeau cannot make disease or health benefits claims for any type of product, service, or program in any advertising, including print, radio, Internet, television, and direct mail solicitations, regardless of the format and duration.And Trudeau ADMITTED to this, and paid a $2,000,000 fine. He is a FRAUD, and anyone who gives him money by buying his book is being duped."
1,Horrible,"I read this book from cover to cover. He repeated himself so many times that it was getting obnoxious - what was he repeating? The fact that corporate america is out to take our money and make us unhealthy. In his book, he does not reveal any names of products or describes exactly how to do any of the systems he recommend - you need to go to his website. Once in the website, you need to pay for a membership of 120 a year. What a crock - save your money for this book and go see a doctor."
1,Got bit on this one,"I am not a fan of big drug companies, FTC and the FDA, but boy did I get taken by this man Kevin Trudeau. I bought the book on CD's and listened to Kevin bitch for about 15 hours promising to get to the real information only to tell me in the last chapter that if he told me the truth he would go to jail and lose every thing he owned. He is the deceitful one here pretending to be selling information on natural cures and then delivering nothing but hot air. $54.00 wasted, no wonder he is the target of the FDA."
1,Something like this should not be legal,"The amount of useful information on this book is probably 10 pages, and most likely you already know this information. This is a $30 dollars infomercial, it won't tell you anything unless you pay more money.There is a trend nowadays about living healthy, eating organic, exercising and so on. This is good and there is a lot of good info our there about it, but unfortunately it also spawns con artists like Trudeau that just want your money, and then they want more...Disgusting."
5,Snack all I want,I have been through so many diets I have lost track of them. I have been overweight since I was a Kid. I have tried everything. I mean everything. Reading this book was fabulous. I got a completely new view point on dieting and weight loss. I figured what did I have to lose besides a hundred pounds. So I started on the things he talks about in this book and I am losing weight effortlessly. It is still a little slow but I feel that I have a chance now were I did not feel that way before. Great Book.
1,"Don't waste your money, he is full of it!","This guy is nothing but a con artist. This book is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. There are about 10 pages of useful information in it. How does a convicted felon/car salesman know anything about ""Natural Cures""?Save your money."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"I was very disappointed in this book. The author spoke about exposing all and making cures known....Sure if you want to buy all the items he spoke about.I got the impression from all his promotions that he revealed it all in his book, I feel like I wasted my money buying it."
1,"""NO"" Natural Cures","I purchased this book and soon returned it for a full refund---from a Wholesale House...Why---because there are no natural cures in this book unless you go to K.T.'s website and plunk down another wad of cash...There are so many things in this book I would not do...one example--given the times we live in--I would not go out without a sunscreen or sunglasses..Melanoma is on the uprise and Sunglasses with a UV rating have been shown to help to prevent Cataracts...Some of his notions are costly mistakes, so buyer beware...When in doubt use a search engine to read all that you can."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Trudeau gives readers a choice - they can give their money to corporate interests who only have profits in mind, or they can give it to Kevin Trudeau who obviously shares that motive. What Trudeau doles out in this book is either nothing new or is shaky pseudo-science at best. How he believes he is any better than the entities he decries is beyond me.This book is written in the style of those full page ads in newspapers taken out by crazed conspiracy theorists. It is a vanity publication in which you will find no table of contents, index, etc - just disorganized ramblings and the promise that, if you send him more money, he will finally sell you what he has promised to tell you in this book.As P.T. Barnum said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" Trudeau plans on cashing in on every one of them."
1,hehe... i love it...,"well, i didn't really buy the book but i taped the paid programming ad that promotes it and listen to it every time I feel down. I taped it from comedy central and I think it's the only paid programming that actually fits comedy central's normal programming. although there is some truth in it (e.g. that diet/""light"" products contain artificial sweeteners that mess up your metabolism) it is presented in such a great and funny way... he's basically saying 'you are not fat because you don't excercise and eat candy and burgers all the time. it's just a conspiracy' it's so awesome and funny"
1,This guy knows one thing: How to make money!!,Do a Google search and see what people that are qualified to critique this book are saying. The following link is just one of many. http://www.infomercialwatch.org/tran/trudeau.shtml
1,no substance,"As PT Barnum used to say there is a sucker born every minute. This book offers little on what is advertised in the title, it's a come on to join his web site for a fee. He has no medical expertise and his intention appears to be the dollar and not people's health. Buyer beware."
1,Kevin's book is just another giant advertisement,"How silly of me not to have come and read all these reviews before I bought the book. Luckily for me the only refund they accept is on the book and I'm going to send it right back. At least I'll get $20 back. All he did was advertise a website that one must pay to get into to see any of these cures. He's so full of it and I'm ashamed that I fell for it without investigating first.The best thing would be for someone with the money to sign up temporarily on to the website, copy all the so called cures, purifiers, cleanse solutions, etc. and post them free for everyone else to see.I can bet that I've already read them in many of my other web searches or health books that I've previously purchased.Thanks to all who put a warning review. I have to agree. Kevin's book is a waste of time and money.Wish I'd thought about it first :o)Ciao all."
5,Five star book,"I give this book 5 stars for trying so hard. The author sure had a lot to say and it looks like he got it all covered in this book and then some. You gotta give a guy credit for such a hard hitting opinion. I find myself agreeing with most of his conspiracy theories. There are a few things I don't see eye to eye on, but overall I give this author and his book 5 stars for his efforts."
5,Me and my friends love it,"Me and my friends love Natural Cures. The first part was a little hard to get through and I'm not sure I completely understand it, but there are so many good ideas in the book that that didn't stop me. I have shared my copy of the book with my Bridge club that meets once a week. Now we have formed up a ""cures club"" to help each other do the things suggested in the book. Since I have been doing this longer, I tell my friends what changes I've been experiencing which encourages them to start or continue with their life-changes. A ""cures club"" is a good idea. It's a buddy system that helps each other. Me and my friends all love this book."
3,Not a bad book ....,"this book isnt bad. I mean, he talks about things that I already knew. What I dont care for is how he keeps directing you to his website where you have to pay a membership to ""learn more"". Kevin... havent you made enough money with your books?? Your website wont need membership fees if you put advertisements on your site from various health/natural foods advocates. Let them pay for your site and let us readers be ""enlightened"". A lot of people would appreciate that and not be so pissy. But that's just my opinion."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHA,I leafed through this book in B&N (...). This book is too funny! I bet that most of the people who buy this book have IQs in the double digits. Those that actually pay to access Trudeau's website probably have single-digit IQ's! I applaud Trudeau for profiting off of the average Joe. What else are the prolies good for??
1,thank God I didn't purchase wen I saw his infomercial,Fortunately I did a little research before I fell for his sales infomercial. I am thankful that someone on a complaint type website referred me to amazon I would've never thought to come here to read people's reviews. I am sucker for any sales and I was close to calling in but I hate to get caught in a sales call which I have experienced from other infomercials. You call in and the rep tries to sell you 6 other things then when you give them your credit card info you get 'automated' charges.
1,how do you spell con artist?,My title says it all. He preys on people who are down on their luck and are desperate. A parasite in a sea of parasites!
4,He's right you know on these issues,"Hello, I am a reader in the health industry and my eyes were certainly opened when I read this book. I have also ready many of the informative references in the book and have a completely different view of things. The wholesale drugging of our society is a social disease that is ruining many lives. In my profession I see the dispensing of so many unnecessary drugs Since purchasing Trudeau's book, my life and my friends lives have changed dramatically as I know this book gives them specific things to do to improve their health that they didn't have before"
1,Snake oil is better,"""Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You To Know About"" by Kevin Trudeau is at once the best and worst of what America has to offer. At best, we as a country defend the right of anyone to say or believe what they want. At worst, it allows charlatans and con men like Kevin Trudeau to make a dishonest living.Right off the bat the title tells you that you are bein lied to. ""They"" (along with ""Big Tobacco"", ""Big Pharm"", and ""Big Government"") is a term used by con artists to foster a conspiracy mentality that convinces the easily led into believing that, not only is the world full of lies, you are about to find out the TRUTH!Once the hoook has been set the only thing left is to real in the helpless fish. And as usual it means breaking out your checkbook. Website or collection plate that scam works the same.Save yourself the money."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This book, while full of Kevin Trudeau's anger and bitterness toward the medical establishment, is not full of the information he claims that it contains. There is an extensive list of information and webpages on his site where you can go to find out more information about these important health issues ... for a monthly fee! I am an avid reader, and unfortunately, I feel that I've completely wasted my money on this book."
4,Natural Cures,Jury is still out on whether I believe all this stuff or not. It is very interesting though & makes you wonder.
3,Health nut agrees...,Hello I am a health nut... as my family likes to call me. Yes it is true healthy foods make me go gaga. I did not learn much that was new in food from this book. I did learn a lot. He has a nice way of tying all the loose ends together to make a complete picture of what is going on in this country. Worth reading even for a veteran like me.
2,Better information in other books.,"Even though I agree with much of what Kevin Trudeau says, I was quite disappointed in this book. Most of this book repetitively bashes the FDA, pharmaceutical companies and the medical community and only provides vague information regarding maintaining and regaining health. He lures his reader in to ultimately purchase a lifetime membership to his websitefor a fee of $499.00. Supposedly on this website one can find out all the information that he eludes to in his book. My advise would be to spend your money of Dr. Russell Blaylock's book, ""Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life"". Dr. Blaylock goes into much detail supporting his ideas.
