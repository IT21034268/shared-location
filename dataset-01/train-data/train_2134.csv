5,A boost!,"Not only does the workout give you an energy boost, but a powerful, self confidence boost. I'm not yet at my fitness goals, but I'm having FUN getting there. My two year old daughter even asks to do ""Tae - Bo,"" she loves to kick along with mom. Billy is a real motivator, helps give you inner stength and a firmer body from head to toe!"
4,Well worth the wait!,"I ordered my tapes from the infomercial and waited a good 4 weeks for the tapes. The 8 minute workout in the morning is better than a second cut of tea to get me going before work. I love the flexibility of the series because when I'm short for time I can do the 27 minute tape and when I want more I do the 57 minute tape. The 8 minute tape is good to do every morning before work. The music is really blah on the tape and the exercisers could have a more varied body type but all in all it is a fun workout and very empowering. Cathy, New York"
5,Great Work Out for Overworked Moms!,"As the mother of four very young children, I didn't think I'd ever be able to get back in shape. Niether did my husband. My lifestyle simply doesn't offer the time it used to take me to stay in shape at a gym. Enter Billy and Tae-Bo. I'm hooked. In half an hour, I have a full body workout that touches muscles I haven't used since my days as a professional dancer. My mother once told me I'd never see a twenty two inch waist again, and before Tae-bo, I was beginning to believe her. A month or so after my first exposure to tae-bo, I attended a family get together with relatives I hadn't seen in a while. All my relatives could say was: ""Wow, I can't believe you've had four kids."" You know what? Neither can I, because I sure can't tell when I look in the mirror! Thank you Billy for giving me a great workout that I can do anywhere, anytime!"
3,Not too shabby...,The video does a great job of incorporating the styles of martial arts..aerobics and dancing...if this is what you like...Silat is also a great art to consider...like the video..it has dance-like movements..and possesses great health benefits..
3,"Fun, but not challenging","If you're moderately fit, the basic workout is not going to get the job done. It's a nice change of pace when I don't have enough time or willpower to run outside- but I definitely don't feel like I have accomplished much when I'm done. Last night I ran 3-4 miles and then did Tae Bo- which made for a good workout."
3,Have fun with it,I have all four of the Tae Bo tapes. I like them alot but I find that you could easily hurt your knees. So try not to overdo it. Listen to your body and if you think you can't finish the tape. STOP and just come back later or something. It's not worth harming your knees.
3,Pretty good but not earth-shattering!,"So much hype...so little time. Tae-Bo is a good exercise regime. I like doing this video much more than any of the more traditional dance-style exercises. However, I am amazed at the poor quality of the tapes themselves...in the basic workout there is more than one time where the beat and step gets off because someone in the film editing room had no idea what they were doing. That sort of thing drives me nuts. The music sounds terrible, and the whole thing is cheesy as heck. BUT, the workout I like, which is the main reason I bought this tape, right? I don't like the price (I borrowed it and suggest you do the same)...$40 for a preliminary tape and a 30 min workout? Come on. I've ordered the advanced workout (you can now get those 2 tapes seperately without buying the whole 4 tape set if you've already bought the basic) which I think will be a better value."
4,overall good.,"I bought Tae Bo when it first came out & there were 4 tapes. I bacically focsued on the 8 min workout because I work long hours & the last thing I want to do when I get off is go to the gym, or do a 45 min workout. The Tae Bo 8 min workout is just enough to get your heart rate going & sweat dripping. I used to teach aerobics & dance & the one thing people don't undersatnd that the key to losing weight is to sweat, and sweat like hell. Then once you sweat, you sweat you lose weight. Once you lose weight you start to tone. This video does require some discipline. You have to keep working at it. Its not something you can do for a week & then see results. The only thing you'll feel after a week is soreness & I'm in shape. The tape has helped me go from 160lbs to 149lbs in just 3 weeks. But I also eliminated all greasy food from my diet because they have alot of fat in them. So with a little determination, patience & Tae Bo you're bound to see results."
5,energizing!!!!!!!!!!,"I have an anxiety, panic disorder and felt I could not do anything with my life and was so dicourged. Now I have found Tae Boe and It has improved my life 100%. I do the advanced workout 6 days a week and feel great! I would recomend this workout to anyone, results are immediate. Thank you Billy Blanks for my life back!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Okay, I Guess We Aren't Fish People - a review ""Trout, Trout, Trout""","Popeye Shiner,he looks mad.Stonecat.Blindcat.Shad.Shad.Shad!Waccamaw Killifish, see it pass?Largescale Stone roller.Bass.Bass.Bass.Okay, I guess we aren't fish people so maybe that explains why we didn't care much for Trout, Trout, Trout.My children (boy and girl; 4 and 6 when this was read and reviewed) were not gripped by the need to read this book again, nor to recite any of the words--something they typically do with anything that rhymes.Considerations:::Trip Park's artwork is wonderful and humorous, but to get your money's worth with this one I think you have to be into fishing more than normal people. My recommendation would be to check this one out at the library first. It might be that adult fisherman (and women) would enjoy it.The Accelerated Reading Level a generic ""2"".Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksforKids-reviews"
4,Exactly!,Exactly what I ordered and at a great price. Had to do a little research to be sure I was ordering exactly what I needed but it fit my car perfectly and did the job.
4,Good stuff,"Book is very interesting and came to me much sooner than I had expected. It was in ""good"" condition, pages were a bit bent but can't complain, pretty good experience."
1,Terrible textbook,"This textbook was used for my introductory biology class. While the images are well done, the text is lacking. It's a good book if you want something that ""glosses over"" biology, but I would not recommend it for the classroom. I have to agree with the other reviewers."
2,book,the book was a lil bent up out of shape then it was proposed to b. i was a lil disappointed in the product outcome
4,"Good book, no my bilogy","I got the book and it was shipped right away which was a plus but, it did not have the ""my biology"" in it...."
2,Biology: A guide to the natural world with bent cover loose pages,The text book that was rated very good arrived with the front cover folded up like an acordian. the first two pages fell out and there are highlighter and pencil marks all through it. We would have returned it. my son was to start his class in a very few days.
1,very BAD quality,This book was in HORRIBLE condition when i got it. It looked like someone dropped in water and left it there for a few days. It looks like mold spots are stained inside the book. I was not happy with this purchase.
4,THANK YOU!!!,The book was in great condition and got here fairly quickly!! I might add this was the only one of my text book that I ended up receiving from this website so that's why I am thanking you!!!
1,Not what I was told,When I bought this product I was told it was in good/new condition and that nothing was wrong with the book. But when the book arrived at my house I opened it to find out it wasn't what I was told. The binding of the book was taped together from falling apart. The front cover was badly bent that it won't close. And most of the pages are bent. It was not in the condtion I was told it was. I am higly dissatisfied with my purchase and I will never order from this seller again.
1,stay away from this seller LAZY and LIES,"didnt rec till well after xmas and reply from (dec 22) seller had stayed they had shipped it. shipping label dated dec28. along with taking their lazy time to ship item, they also lied about when they shipped it. will not do bussiness with this seller ever again. i dont care if they r selling text book for .01 . if i could i'd give them zero stars but i did rec text book."
3,Confusing Text Book With Errors In Reference Section,"There were many formatting errors in this book, such as the glossary columns being switched around-""G"" doesn't belong in the middle of the ""F"" vocab. Some of the page #'s listed in the index were not correct. If you must use this book then you should know that the info can normally be found close to the page listed in the index. The figures/tables were very useful and restated the text in an organized manner, which helped the flow of the writing."
5,love it,The order was very quick and the book was brand new still in plastic and came with access card in book.
4,A Good General Reference for Utah Travel,"This is a good general book if you intend to make a wide ranging tour of Utah and National and State Parks/Monuments and other sires. It is light on specifics but will help you locate areas of interest and accommodations in those areas. However, for specific information on hiking and unusual sites you will need other references."
5,Great Resource Guide,"We went to a lot of the restuarants recommended and they were all great. Handy and easy to transport, what more can you want."
2,so so,"text is as expected for a Frommer's guide book but no pictures. maps are excellent and downloadable which is a great feature. definitely not as browsable as a paper guide book, where you can skip around much more easily. I would have liked for pictures to be included. I felt like I was not getting the whole guide book"
2,bad impression right off the bat,"opened up the box and right away, the wood is coming unglued. Open it, and you can see where the pad that they cushion the tools with, had fallen off and they reglued it on, but in a different spot. So there's a strip of glue running down the lid. So far chisels seem ok for the price, but could be better."
4,Works good after sharpening,"This set is nice and heavy, seems like a good deal, but make sure you sharpen the edges straight out of the box. I'm new to turning so at first I didn't know anything was wrong, except that people on TV seemed to cut through stock like butter, and I was struggling to round-out a square blank. I honed the blades a little with an eze lap paddle, and wow, the difference was like night and day. I don't know how long these chisels will hold an edge, but they are capable of very nice cuts. Also, there is some kind of coating on the steel that I removed with fine sandpaper before honing."
4,For the Price Great tools,"I don't have this full set of tools but I have several Benjamin's Best tools, including several in this set. For the price they are great tools. In my experience they hold an edge for about the same length of time my HHS Sorby or Hamlet tools do. The depth of the flutes or the gouges are different from my other tools, and I find the ones on my other tools to be superior, but that is probably because I am more familiar with the other tools. This is a good beginners set, and other Benjamin's best tools are available which can round out this set. I am a particularly big fan of their scrapers which are a small fraction of the price of the brand name tools."
4,Seem like good chisels,They seem like good quality chisels but were not real sharp when received. After I sharpened them they cut pretty good but I am a new turner so don't have much to judge them by.
3,losing the handle,After using several of the tools from this selection three of the tools began to loosen from the handles. I have been turning some seasoned stock and maybe these tools can't handle hardwoods. They seemed to work fine with green stock. Other than the loosening of the handles they perform fine. I solved the problem by shimming the tool stock back into the receiving end of the handle.
4,Very good value,"Long time woodworker but new to turning, I've been through a few sets trying to find some I like. These are solid, comfortable in the hand and stay sharp better than I has expected. Good length handles and the machining is good. No burrs, etc. I sharpened them out of the box and they cut very well."
3,knives,"The set is well worth the money, good quality, good steel, if the handles wood be longer they would be great"
3,Dull Blades,"The tools arrived very dull. In fact, the smaller bowl gouge had an edge bent over. Once the tools were sharpened, they work fine. I was disappointed in the condition of the edges on delivery.PSI Woodworking LCHSS8 HSS Wood Lathe Chisel Set, 8-Piece"
3,I ordered them thinking the paper would be better (thick) quality but it's not that great!,"I got them today in the mail, but the product was not up to my expectations. I guess, I didn't know what parchment paper looked like. But nevertheless, I was looking for a thicker paper with a somewhat glossy finish. This is way too loose, for me to print a certificate on it and award them to someone. Also, the gold foil embossed border is too golden! Strikingly so, if I may add. I may consider looking for other paper options with a different finish, from Geographics perhaps, but this one- definetely no!"
3,Look great!,"I really like these for the certificates I give to my students at the completion of their certification. I find however, that they quite often get stuck in my printer. They get all mangled, and they are not cheap, so this makes each page very expensive. Love the way they look though."
4,Glad to finally find this,"I used to play this on my college radio show in Western PA back in 83-84(?) (I grew up in Eastern PA hence why I knew about the Hooters). I was of course thrilled when Nervous Night was released and was a big hit - but was REALLY not happy with the version of ""Hanging On A Heartbeat"" and to a lesser extent, ""All You Zombies."" And that unhappiness continued with ""FIghtin' On The Same Side"" on ""One Way Home."" So now - the world has been made right again."
4,Nice boot for light hiking,I liked this boot. It'd be great for light trekking or backpacking over fairly easy terrain (i.e. too light for bouldering or hard scrabble). It's probably too light for serious mountaineering as it's not high enough in the ankle. I've done a couple of 5-day trips with this boot and found they worked well. Won't work well with crampons. Good boot for the money and not hard to break in.The last trip I took with a heavier Garmont boot and regretted it.
3,"Slow start, no finish","The begining was a bit slow, but I at times expect that from some authors, they prefer to take extra care in the setup. Then there was a point where the 'Good parts' started happeneing, and this renewed my interest. The ending, though, was not one, in my opinion. It skidded to a halt with several deaths and an underdone resolution. It left me wanting to know more about what happened afterward. It's an incomplete tale that left me wishing not for a sequel, but for the last 20 or 30 pages of an unfinished story."
4,One of Sauls best,"Having read hellfire, Nathanel and The Homing i found Creature to be my favorite one of his books yet. I'm not a huge Saul fan simply beacause most of the charecters seem the same in each book and they are always in a small remote town but i found i had finished this book within a couple of days. Good read :)"
2,I thought this was going to be scary,"This was my first john saul book and i was very disapointed. The first 100 pages were alright but the rest of the book i was waiting for something to happen. And nothing ever did! The ending was horrible with nothing being solved and everyone being killed off. Very depressing. Also I heard this was going to be a scary, freightening read. What a joke.i have not read a Saul book since this and probably won't for a long time."
1,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"A family moves into a perfect town, to find out it isn't so perfect. It's a place where scientists try expirements on kids to make them stronger foot-ball players. The book is as dumb as it sounds."
2,Should I give John another chance?,"My first John Saul book. Easy reading, but nothing happens. I never read a horror book and I bought this book because I heard John is the best. It was a dissapointing choice. I think I'll give him another chance, but not now."
3,Good book sad ending.,I liked this book. Although it is very prdictable I still wanted to read and see if I was right. (I was) I did like the charecters and i thought they were well written. I cared what happend to them. A few unexpected twists towards the end for a book so predictable. A good read if you have nothing else to do.
4,Great Book!,"It may have not been exciting in the beggining, but it was still good. Gradually it became very suspensefull, and terrific. I loved it. The ending was so sad, but I still would recomend this book to anybody. I'm starting a on-line horror book club. If you are interested, e-mail me at the above address."
4,A Book I will remember. Couldn't put it down.,It was one of those sad horror novels. I loved it. It put a real twist to the reality of sports medicine and how this was a coaches idea! Simply amazing. If anyone knows anymore good John Saul books E-Mail me.
4,pretty good book,a little slow at first but once I got to the middle of the book it started to get really suspensful. I liked the way they made the main character go from a dork to a really mean guy.
3,Okay book....,"Having this being my first John Saul book (I haven't been able to read another), the detail and twists which were in the plot were very good but Creature did not have a big enough vocabulary to satisfy me; he repeated many words and I would suggest to him to at least use a thesaurus. It was a bit predictable but a good book to read if you have nothing better to do...."
2,Dont pick it up...,"In my opinion, Creature, was not a very interesting read. The title itself is plain enough to make you turn your head the other way, but I sampled the novel anyway. It was okay..for the first 50 or so pages but began to drag. If you make it past page 150, its an accomplishment! If you want a good book to start, try one of John Saul's earlier writings, ""Nathaniel"""
3,This is kinda crazy,"This was the first John Saul book I have read. It was a lot more violent than I thought it would be. The book creature was really hard to get into. It gets better as you go, but it never really says what happens in the end. Saul really goes into detail in the beginning. That is why it is so hard to get into. This book is for people who like murder and mystery. I liked it for the most part, because it keeps you wondering."
2,left me cold,"As with some of the others who reviewed this book, i really liked it for the first 100 pages or so. Then it just sort of quit. The dialogue was boring, the characters were wooden and unbelievable, the ending just plain sucked. And i'm a fan of Saul! I also agree that at times it felt like a young adult mystery, nothing very challenging to think about. I finished it just because it was so light, and i feel that i should always finish a book after i've started. I kept waiting for something rational to happen, i mean a town with only health food and citizens who are ALL football fans, come on now! Plus the parents seem oblivious to the fact that their children are becoming mindless aggressive apes. In the end i didn't even really care about what happened, but then again that's just my humble opinion."
3,Ok Sprinkler - There are others that are more fun,"We bought this sprinkler for my son (age 3) but it's just ok. The stream of water it produces it pretty small - and you have to turn up the water pressure pretty high for the character to actually start spinning. (Higher pressure than my 3 year old likes) ... We have another ""caterpillar"" shaped sprinkler that has multiple water spouts, and he definitely prefers that one to this sprinkler. While this sprinkler is ok - for the money, I think there are better alternatives."
2,beware of cheap knockoffs,"In shopping for a pet stroller, I came across this stylish looking stroller for less than half the price of the pet gear ""happy trails"". The 3 wheel design was especially interesting, because I wanted to use the stroller at festivals, etc...over differing terrains. I almost bought this one when I read that back wheels have a tendency to bend or even fall off when loaded with a dog even 15 lbs, which is a huge concern for the animal's safety and wouldn't work for me since my dog is nearing that weight. I opted instead for the Pet Gear ""Sportster"", where I'm able to transport 2 dogs weighing a total of 27 lbs and numerous camera gear in the basket below and have logged around 60 miles or so without a problem. I would give it 2 stars on concept alone, as this stroller may work fine for a single tiny dog or cat."
5,Best of both worlds!,"This is a magnificent book. The school lessons are witty & appropriate, the bulletin board illustrations & photos give you a good sense of the finished product, and the prose is written in a light, humorous manner.Some of the ideas in the book are for specifically for Catholics, some specifically for Protestants, and a lot can be used for both. That is the main strength of the book, its versatility.If you are afraid to purchase it because you think it might not fit into your own version of Christianity, shame on you. This is for macro-Christianity, it transcends ""little boxes"" and artificial divisions. We all love Jesus, and you should all buy this book.I cannot recommend it any higher."
5,"Great ideas, excellent presentation","If you're in the market for bulletin board ideas for Sunday School, this book is for you. If you are looking for bulletin board ideas for a Parochial School this is you.This book understands that not everyone is an artist, and provides simple, great looking examples for you to base your work on. If you happen to be of the artistic persuasion, the examples are more than enough to get your imagination started.There is no other book out there with the range of topics for so many situations. There is a large quantity of quality ideas.I highly recommend it"
5,It made my top 5 list for non-fiction,Quick and to the point it wastes not a word yet reads well. Accurate observations about american society's need for attention with special emphasis on the roles of class and gender. It points out problems and possible answers.It is excellent.
1,More like Try & Cry Hangman,"I purchased a copy of Hangman #2 from a local store and to my dismay this particular copy doesn't scratch off. I used a dime and scratched a hole in the page. I then used a nickel but that just made the gray dots, shining silver dots. I finally moved on to a pencil eraser which did work but one puzzle used the entire eraser and it took quite a bit of elbow grease to even get that to work. My daughter was very frustrated to say the least. From other reviews it appears that others have had a good experience with some of these books. Could the problem be that these books are printed in China? Perhaps the gray dots on some copies are actually lead based paint dots rather than the usual latex ink! What gives?"
3,Reader Feedback,"I looked at every book available on PROXY SERVER 2.0 before I decided to purchase Curt Simmons version. My main reason for choosing his book was the copy of Proxy Server 2.0 (30-Day Trial) and the Quizzer program to help prepare for the test. Unfortunately the 30-Day Trial version needed at least Windows NT and a copy of IIS for it to work, so it was worthless to me. The quizzer program was very helpful although you do need a password or key to open it up. The key is suppose to be hidden in the book somewhere, but I had to call the company to get it (they didn't know where to find it in the book either). The topic is dry and you have to force yourself through it all, but most of the MCSE books are that way. All in all, I might have bought another book on the topic had I known the 30-day trail version would not be accessable to me."
4,"Very helpful, but some errors","I find all the IDG books helpful, informative and written in a consice manner. I picked up the Exam cram for proxy, and found information (like the bandwidth formula) that just wasn't in the IDG book. Proxy Server by IDG also had gramatical and spelling errors. I suggest 2 books on any given topic."
4,NOT A BAD BOOK,"This is not a bad book like I said. Will it and the BeachFront Quizzer alone get you through the test? Yes. Will you get a 1000? NO. You will get excellent info on everything except integration. The typos in this book are many but, easily seen as such. A very easy to read book in easy to understand terms. Get the Transcenders. I did only test A and the book and Quizzer I got an 838 it was all that I needed. Will this book enable you to setup Proxy and support the product? If you want a jump start and exercises it sure will!!!! Now I am an MCSE and ready to take IIS."
3,This book needs a slight overhaul!,"The book is adaquate in teaching you the fundamentals of the product. However, I don't believe it alone is sufficient to prepare someone for the exam. I came across quite a few errors. A request to the publisher for an errata went unanswered. After a few obvious errors early in the book, I lost faith and used other meams to prepare. Also, the review questions at the end of each chapter are not at all challenging. My suggestion is ""shop around"". Don't be misled by the 4.5 star rating (like I was)."
5,Excellent book...,"I really think this book is great. It's concise, clear, and easy to read - not to mention that it has an eval version of the Proxy Server software included. I studied the book quickly, passed the test, and really feel like I could support the product."
3,Are these real comments?,"I don't understand this. The book is listed as ""Not Available"", and yet you have a customer review posted?"
2,This book needs some serious work!,"I can't tell you how many errors I have found in the book. I've counted so many, that I am marking them as I go with a Postit pad so I can let everyone know about each one I have found. The tests are pretty good though. I like knowing after every question whether or not I was correct. The only problem is that some of the questions makes references to pages in the book that do not explain the answer to the question. Overall, I would not recommend using this as you only study source. Make sure you check the Braindump sites and any other Proxy info you can find."
1,DOA,"Just like the other reviewer, mine did nothing either. I went through three new batteries before giving up. Amazon should set up a test dept. to check all new products before allowing their seller to cheat Amazon's loyal shoppers. These units are produced in Korea (I wonder North or South, LOL). It seems a lot of junk from Korea and China is flooding out markets, same thing at ebay, way too much junk. The reviews on Amazon help a lot when you remember to read them, and please, when you get a bad product right a review. Oh yes, the one star rating is the worst Amazon allows, too bad they don't provide a minus sign!"
1,Ouch! Not a plug and play experience for me.,I bought one and it never worked. Right out of the box it never turned on despite using a new battery.It sat there and did nothing and nothing I did would make it work. Maybe if I got another one it would work but who wants to take that chance.
3,Badly packaged,"There was insufficient packaging surrounding this item and the case was damaged. The DVD itself was unharmed and, as good as expected"
2,Slow and juiceless,"The tempi used in the recording are very slow, draining whatever life this rather tedious work with one melody has. Fleming's voice is beautiful but her singing her is full of a diva's indulgence. Hampson is in poor voice and Sabatinni is as provincial sounding a tenor as there can be. For this Fleming fan, this recording is major dissapointment."
3,Una Opera menor.,"Thais de Massenet es una obra que tiene cierto mérito, pero indudablemente al margen de ciertos pasajes bien logrados (Su famosa Meditación, por ejemplo), el resto de la Opera no pasa de regular. La interpretación de Reneé Fleming es Ok, lo mejor del elenco está en el gran barítono Thomas Hampson. La dirección de Abel de punta a punta, nos demuestra que es un músico todavía en proceso de formación.Sólo para fans de Massenet.PS.- Con los grandes artistas que tiene DECCA, podría haber lanzado al mercado una interpretación muy superior a esta."
3,Why bother?,"This is an excellent performance of a work that is not worth the trouble. The music is bombastic, the plot silly even by operatic standards. I hope Ms. Fleming, who is justly acclaimed as they best soprano going, and Mr. Hampson, who never gives less than 110 per cent, will find some more suitable project to demonstrate their talents. Hampson I would love to hear as Pelleas and Fleming would be a great Leonora in either Trovatore or Forza. Perhaps this was a ""vanity"" recording--recorded because both of the stars wanted to do it, but they should really look for music of more depth and consequence."
3,Not bad for an Opera,"This CD exceeded my expectations. I honestly thought that the CD would be boring. It wasn't too bad. The songs in this CD are pretty much okay. I only gave it three stars because I was comparing it to operas composed by composers such as Mozart, Verdi, and Puccini. But overall the CD was pretty good. If you're a big opera fan I highly recomend this CD. If you're not such an Opera fan I don't suggest that you get this CD."

4,An Interesting Story About a Priest Who Made a Difference,This is an interesting story about Father Kapaun. I had not previously known anything about him. Those he served were very grateful for the difference he made in their lives. His is a story well worth hearing.
4,Very helpful,"Being an Earth Science major in school, I found this book helpful for most general Earth Science terms, but when it gets down to the more advanced terms (ie for mineralogy, petrography, etc), this book is somewhat lacking. Overall helpful with general knowledge."
4,Circus of Freaks,"Circus of FreaksHave you been looking for a book that leaves you hanging on the edge after every page turn? We have a book that will do just that. Darren is a curious boy who just can't seem to leave well enough alone. Darren's life changes drastically in a short period of time, when he attends a Freak show.Nate-Corey-Ashton-Seva"
4,Circus fo freaks,"Circus of FreaksI got it!! Were the words of Darren Shan. Darren has a ticket to go to a freak show. Steve Darren's best friend has the other ticket. Darren and Steve have the biggest adventure of their lives. And not to mention some of the biggest problems anyone could possibly have. These problems end up changing the rest of their lives. Mr. Crepsley, who is one of the freaks of the freak show, saves Steve's life after a freak accident. But before Mr. Crepsley saves Darren's best friend, Darren has to do a big deed for Mr. Crepsley. This deed that Darren has to do will take Darren away from his normal life of a 13-year-old boy. Darren has to decide if he wants to keep his life, or save his best friends."
5,must read,"This book is a terrific adventure, sad that the movie based off of the book poorly reflected it. At least in my opinion!"
5,Awesome read,"According to my children, the book was really good. They had to read it and write a report for one of their classes."
5,An amazing story,"I couldn't put this book down becauuse it left me hungry for more.This book was cool because the freaks that all kids like were weird. Some characters were: Gertha, Madam Octa, Mr. Creapsly and Hand Hands. He could sprint faster than anyone. His name was Hand Hands because he ran with his hands instead of his feet because he didn't have any feet. This was the best plot I've ever read!"
5,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK!!,"I read Cirque Du Freak: A Living Nightmare, written by Darren Shan. The main character is a young boy named Darren Shan. He and his best friend get their hands on two tickets to see a secret freak show. They, and the rest of the audience, are amazed at what they see. Darren loves spiders, and would do anything to get the giant tarantula, Madam Octa, who is in the show. Unfortunatly, the man who owns her is a vampire, as Darren finds out in a weird turn of events. He steals the spider at night, and takes it in his room to play with it. His best friend gets bitten, and you won't believe what Darren has to do to heal him.I really liked this book. It was easy to follow along, and it was very suspensful. The one thing I didn't like is that it didn't last long enough. I have not read another book in its class."
5,Why You Should Get The Entire Series,"What starts to be a fictional kid's memoir gradually grows and grows into one of the most outstanding adventure novel(s) I've ever read. Each book becomes more intense as it goes along and many of its characters are memorable. Though there is nothing wrong with romance novels, it is truly great and different to see a vampire series with very little distraction by a crush.Anyone who is into young adult fiction, an almost chilling action series, and vampires should give this series a chance."
5,Great Teen Books,"My 14 year old loves these book. He is not a very big reader, but he actually read these ones. He mainly reads when he is grounded, but these one he read even when he wasn't grounded!"
5,A wonderful start to a great series,"I've read this book a couple times now. I was more than impressed upon my first reading. Darren makes a decision I'm not sure many adults could make for a friend. His decision makes him a vampire.From the start this is a page turner, easily read in one sitting and hungry for more. Towards the end of the book when Darren must leave his family it's very powerful. The entire book has the read pulled in from the first page. And this leaving of the family is enough to tear at the heartstrings.I recommed this book to adults and children alike. It's EXCELLENT and a must keep to read many times over."
2,SMALL,The picture on the page is fake its not that coolits completely black and really small and what they dont tell you is that it is just one book the first book from the series it is hard covered and has a red page paint on the side top and bottom of the book
5,AWESOME!,"I purchused this book at a local barnes & nobles. when i got home i couldnt put it down,i was hooked. the way the author made the circus performers come to live was amazing.All the little details he put in (especially at the ends of the chapter) were great. all in all the book is a great read and a good birthday present!"
1,If you pick it up you'll have to finish it and that would be a bad thing,"First I would like to congratulate Darren Shan on eleven good books. I say eleven purposefully because had he left the series unfinished I would feel more closure than I do having read the entire thing.Do not pick up this book, if you do you will be enticed to read the entire series at the end of which you will find out the whole thing is akin to a dream sequence and not only that but Darren O'Shaughnessy (I refuse to acknowledge the arrogance associated with using his pseudonym as the protagonist) uses the most base and sophomoric writing tricks.If Darren O'Shaughnessy has any self respect he will scrap the last two books and rewrite the ending to something that makes a modicum of sense. Let me offer him a start to this new ending, something happened somebody died or somebody lived and who that somebody might have been."
1,The series is not worth the trouble!!!!!!!,"First, I have read the whole D.S. series getting many books from amazon.uk. The frist book was great I must admit. By book 9 you are totaly let down. The end of the series is very week!!!! The author is in love with himself and you can defiantely find many many more books and series more worthy of your time. Please take my advice and reda another series. This series could have been summed up in a trilogy instead of draggggging it out so much. By the way this is the first bad review I have ever given a series or book!"
4,cirque du freak bk 1,I found this book to be very thrilling and entertaining. It was an on the edge of your seat book. It kept me guessing from page 1. It wasn't the best cirque du freak book but it is close. But if I had to read any book this would be this. I may only be on book 6 but I plan to read all of them. Keep them coming.
3,Cirque Du Feak,"I thought this book was pretty good; it wasn't the best book I have read though. But it was strong in detail. And had some good parts, but it was kind of gross!Darren Shan went to a freak show with his best friend Steve. They thought it was great, but they didn't know this is when all their problems would begin. One of the freaks was a vampire, who could control a big deadly spider! Darren loved spiders so he decided to steal the vampire's spider! But a few days later when Steve came over and Darren showed him what he stole, Darren wished he'd never laid eyes on the spider!I think mostly boys will like this book. Its pretty gross and has some exciting parts. I think boys who are around 13 years old will like this book. It has some hard parts, but is mostly a pretty easy book to read."
4,Bites You Hard,"Looking for a scary, violent, vampire book with no romance? Well this is the book for you. Cirque Du Freak is my favorite book, because it's interesting to see and feel the main character's perspective. Like when he goes into the strange Cirque Du Freak, he explains how it feels to walk down a long hallway to meat a big man named Mr.Tall. I also love this book because the characters are interesting. Like Sam, he is interesting because he is violent, he loves bloody, scary, horror books, and he has a bad attitude. Alan, a soccer player who plays like a champ. Darren Shan, our main character and our author. He has a normal life until he goes to the Cirque Du Freak with his best friend Sam. Suddenly Sam becomes very nervous when he sees a performing spider, and suddenly Darren's life changes forever! WHAT HAPPENED?Connor Age 12"
4,if a kid who hates can read this so can you,"In my opinion this book was excellent. A very good writer, he leaves you guessing, and is heart warming and compelling. This book is about a freak show that comes to town and the main character is in love with spiders, so when he goes to the show with his friend he sees a spider charmer, and a spider named Madam Octa. After the show the main character decides to kidnap it and become a spider charmer himself. But during his training the spider freaks out and bites his friend for in-order to save his friends life he has to see the spider charmer, but the spider charmer makes a deal with him. ""I will save him but you have to become my apprentice."" And in order for him to do that he has to fake his own death. And that is only the first in the twelve series of the books. I recommend this book to every sci-fi lover and spider lover."
5,Outstanding for Any Age,"There are very few books that I can't...just can't...put down. Cirque Du Freak was one of them. I purchased this book on a whim, and found the story to be completely engrossing.Darren Shan has a real talent for giving for writing a story. I just purchased the next 7 books, and can't wait to dig in."
5,This book is great!,"This book is great. When I got it I thought it would be like any old book, but I was totally wrong I couldnt stop reading it! I think I have read this book about 12-17 times. My advice is to go and buy this book! Even older kids that are 16 even grown ups that are 45 like this book its great for all age groups. Also its not scary but it has some freaky stuff in it to make you sit at the edge of your chair. And the best thing is that there are going to be in the range of 20 books to do with this so its better for everone! If you like this book go and buy The Vampires Assistant!"
2,Not All That,"Cirque du Freak is not a really good book but its alright, There are too many boring parts in it and the storyline is boring.The only part I like in the story is when Darren becomes a vampire assistant, other then that the story is horrible. Overall I rate this book a 1.5!"
5,a heart racing tale,"this book is wonderful!! i love the harry potter books and it was hard for me to start a new series..but this book is soo cool.. if you do not have anything to read right now or even if you do, i urge you to read this..you will not be sorry."
4,Madam Octa's Revenge,"Madame Octa's Revenge(Signed: The Spider Revenge)The book Cirque Du Freak is about a spider named Madame Octa. She made an incredible turn in the book. Darren Shan, Steve, and Mr. Crepsley are the three main characters. Darren makes a decision and it changes his life forever. Steve was Darren's best friend and he got two tickets to the freak show, Cirque Du Freak. Mr. Crepsley was Madame Octa's owner and he immortalized Darren. I would give Cirque Du Freak four stars out of five...MichealChelseaJoshuaJessicaTyler"
3,The Stake,The StakeWe thought this book was O.K. The freaky things are what we did not like about it. The book was a little in to the future. It is a 3 *** book. It was a little bit sickening at times.Blue and Gold
5,The Change of Forever,"You all know about vampires. But do you know the things you have to go through to become one? In Cirque Du Freak, two boys, Darren and Steve go to the circus of freaks.They run into Mr.Crepsley a Cirque Du Freak actor.When they are leaving, they realize their life is going to change forever, in many ways. But then something happens to Steve. Darren has to make dramatical changes to save him.What will he do? I recommend you to read this book. You should read this book if you are into fantasy type of books."
4,"Good...mistakes, however...","I was just looking at this book a while ago. All my memories are coming back- this is a perfect story to the beginning of the series Cirque Du Freak. However, I found that the story itself moved too fast for my taste, and the characters did seem a tiny bit flat, but all in all, it's okay for a horror story that actually makes more sense than most, it doesn't have as gross scenes as I've read in other books, and it does give you a taste of reality. ..."
5,This book is great if you enjoy horror stories like me.,"A thrilling adventure including spiders, vampires, Freak shows and a boy named Darren. This is a perfect story for a person who is just beginning to read horror stories because it is just starting to embrace tactics used to write a perfect horror story. I enjoyed it and can't wait for the 3rd book to come out."
3,Really Darren... your not the least a kid,"A living Nightmare was great! I loved it from the start. It was really interesting and just thrilling! The author descibes everything in very good detail.But why did i give it 3 stars, not 5?One of the reviewers mentioned it before. What Darren says isn't... kiddish. You know, kidlike. As a kid, I know what we say. The author sometimes forgets that he chose the main character as a kid, not an adult. It was weird. In the beginning, the author was really good, and said stuff like us. ex. 'the usual crap'But as I got further in the book, Darren started sounding like a grown up.I mean, what kind of kid would say: ""Like what kind of kid would say: 'It would be a pity to stop now'.ok whoevers reading this, you're probably an adult and think im whack saying thats not too high vocab. The thing is, no kid, and i mean NO KID in the world would say 'pity' unless their like a nerd or like doing it for work of somethinotherwise, pretty good. 3 stars"
2,Unpleasant,"An unpleasant book. Exactly what was it in the killing of an innocent goat at the freak show did Darren find ""thrilling""?"
3,good book,"i give this book rate of 3 because i like about how the vampire have their own show.Andhow the darren sean who is the main people in the book, who try to save the vampire against the vampszze and i like all the stuff effect this one because vampire is not real and the main thing of this story i that darren sean who went to the show and his friend got bite by the spiderso he have to turn in to half vampire because only way tht he can save his friend is to turn in to the vampire that why i give this book rate of 3.what i don like about this book is that they stay in only one place.what i don like about this book the most is that there only few people on onle book."
4,The night that changed darrens life forever,The night that changed Darren's life foreverThe book Cirque Du Freak is about a boy named Darren and his friend Steve. They stole money from Steve's mothers money jar and then bought tickets to see the freak show on Saturday night. On Saturday they went to the freak show and found out that the host of the show (Mr.Crepsly) was a vampire. After the show Steve stayed and confronted Mr. Crepsly while Darren Stole Mr.Crepsly's spider (Madam Octa). About 3-night later Madam Octa bit Steve when he went to the hospital Darren went to Mr.Crepsly and gave the spider back. He asked for the antidote so that his friend Steve wouldn't die but Mr. Crepsly said that he would only save his friend if Darren agreed to become a vampire and be his assistant. He didn't want to but he knew he had to save his Friend........
3,Freaky Deaky,"We believe that Cirque Du Freak was awesomely coool. The way it used details to describe scenes, was magnificent. There were parts that were way out of this world. But to like something like this book you have to be into fantasy stories.Captain KeelHaul &Surgeon Run-A-Rig"
5,The best book you will ever read,"Darren Shane a strong,brave,young boy,makes a path with a mysterious person to save his friends life.Now his simple life is one big obstacal to stay alive.He has to work his way up the system with the new people he has meant or he can end up dead.He needs to earn there trust by proven himself to the system.Cirque Du Freak (A Living Nightmare)is a book of mystery and imagination.It was like I was apart of Darren; everytime he was happy,I was happy,everytime he was confused,I was confused.These addicting novels are my all time favorites, and should be read by everyone.Cirque Du Freak (A Living Nightmare) is a heart stopping book. I recommend this book to anyone who want to enjoy what there reading.This book is a neverending story that keeps getting better and better.(...)"
4,Very good book,"After watching so many young adults hungrily read through this series at our library, I wanted to try it out. I can honestly say I definitely am eager for book 2!"
5,Oh my lord,This book is amazing the whole series is amazing I love Darren Shans work. I hope he lives for decades to come
5,Read me,"Cirque Du Freak is very well written book. The book kept me on the egde of my seat. When I first saw the book I wasn't very happy about reading, but then I got into the book and I loved it. I can't say anything bad about this book because of how much enjoyment I had reading it. I read the book in my reading class at The Lab School. I finshed the book within the school because I couldn't put the book down. It cought my intersets. I am hoping that my last years reading teacher and good friend gets time out to read #2 because I will be reading it."
3,Brain Candy,"It's a good book, but not the best. It makes good ""Brain Candy"", or just something to hold you over and keep you entertained for a while. Darren acts out of character most of the time, and when he does, it's just unrealistic. The lines are cliche, and the only character I really felt for was Mr. Crepsley."
5,The Change of Forever,"The Change of Forever is a book about two boys Darren and Steve. When the boys decide to go to the Cirque Du Freak, they realize that there life is going to change...forever. When something happens to Steve, its up to Darren to save his best friend. But Darren is going to do whatever he can to save his best friend (Steve) but i dont think Darren knew what he was going to get himself into when he figured out that in order to save his friend he was putting his own life in danger.Sportsfan_21661416"
4,The Living Nightmare,"Cirque De Freak was a very interesting and fun book to read. The main characters in this book are Daren, Allen, Steve, Mr.Crepsley, and Madam Octa. The main characters in the story came across many problems in the book. One problem was when Steve and Daren went to the freak show. After the freak show, Steve stole a spider named Madam Octa. While at Daren's house, Daren's sister came into his room and screamed which made Madam Octa bite Steve. There were many adventures in the story. One adventure was they had to ""borrow"" money from Steve's mom in order to go to the freak show. After they ""borrowed"" the money Steve snuck out to go get the tickets to the freak show. We give this book ****4 stars. Cirque De Freak was a very exciting book to read.**Natasha, Kayla, Justin, and Brian**~The four ballas!!!~"
5,Cirque Du Awsome!!!!!!,This book is about 4 friends who try to get tickets to the Cirque Du freak. It turns out to be the most terrifying night of their lives. Great book for Harry Potter fans. Chilling to the perfect perportions!!!
5,A Great Debut Book For Teens From Author Darren Shan,"I was first drawn to Darren Shan's ""Cirque Du Freak,"" when I saw the cover, that it was reccomended by the one and only J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books. After reading all four Harry Potter books in under a month, and liking every moment of them, disided to give ""Cirque Du Freak"" a try. I was amased!! I actually had to force myself to stop reading so I could get some sleep for school the next day. When I finally finished the book, I was disapointed by one thing, the last three words, TO BE CONTINUED!! And the next book is not coming out till September!!!!!! I am definaly buying book two when it comes out, and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did this first one."
3,#1 CHEESEY POOF,"CIRQUE DU FREAK:A LIVING NIGHTMARE IS WRITTEN BY DARREN SHAN FEATURES HIM AS THE MAIN CHARACTER. HE HAS A BEST FRIEND, NAMED STEVE. THEY GO TO SEE THE CIRQUE DU FREAK ONE NIGHT. DARREN MAKES A HORRIBLE MISTAKE BY STEALING A POISONOUS SPIDER. DARREN IS THEN TURNED INTO A HALF VAMPIRE BY THE OWNER OF THE SPIDER TO SAVE HIS BEST FRIEND STEVE.

4,The Freak Show,Once upon a time there was a Freak show.Darren and his friend Steve got some money out of Steve's mom's money jar. So on Saturday they went to the Freak show. Then the werewolf bit off the old ladies hand. After the show was over Steve stayed there because he wanted to become a vampire. But then Darren heard them talking so Darren come back to get Steven. So then they went home but then Mr.Crepsley talked to Darren he talked he talked him in to become his Vampire assistant. So he could save Steve. His best friend.

5,Suprisingly Good in a Wierd Way,"I'm a 13 year old GIRL, and this, is a child's Steven King! There are 12 books and I read the first one like two weeks ago and I'm already on the fourth! Its a story about a boy and how he ""stole"" this spider. Now that was very scary for me because I have aracnaphoba (or however you spell it), and if felt as if I was there! It SCARED me when he took the HUGE, DEADLY spider out of his cage! Well, I'm just jumping into the middle of the book! Woops! Well, you'll need to find out how it comes to be like that and how it ends! Its something worth while to read! For all those adults that like scary books but not like the disturbing kind that Steven King does, then this is the book for you! ENJOY THE BOOK!!"
4,Cirque Du Freak,"Cirque Du Freak is a fictional book about a group of friends that have their lives change forever. Two of them Darren and Steve go to a freak show. Something scary and extraordinary happens to them. An accident caused their friendship to break up. The accident was that Steve gets bit by the world's most deadliest spider and it leaves him in a comma and the only way Darren can save him is to become half vampire and get the antidote. He chooses to turns half vampire to save his friend. I liked this book because it kept me wondering what's going to happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysterious, horror books."
5,Beautiful in appearence and finely crafted.,A very impressive piece of jewelery in a hard to find retro style reminiscent of the art deco period. The perfect dress up accessory. Looks like a much more expensive watch.
1,Strange Interaction,"I was buying the watch for my mother and after entering my usual credit card information into amazon, the seller called me on a cell phone to get my credit card. It sounded very strange to me and I canceled my order. I have purchase tons of items from amazon and have never encountered a seller like this. They may be reliable as other reviewer say but I felt uncomfortable sharing my information to a person on a staticy cell phone."
2,Skip it-better books out there,"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought 3 books when I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes & this one cost the most & it was the least helpful. I didn't like the questions & answer format of this book. I wanted facts & advice, not corny questions & answers. Alot of fluff. I recomend Managing your Gestational Diabetes by Lois Jovanovic-Peterson MD instead."
2,101 Tips for a Healthy Pregnancy with Diabetes,Very basic information. I skimmed it for a few minutes when I got it and have not picked it up sense.
2,Nothing New,"This book might have good tips for someone with gestational or Type 2 diabetes, but it was nothing new for me. I really did not learn one thing that I didn't already know. It is well written and to the point. Very helpful for those who just started this game of diabetes, but I've been Type 1 for 30 years and already been through 1 pregnancy."
3,"Looks nice, but has defects","These shoes look great. But the first time they were worn, some of the studs fell off."
3,A bit simplistic,"While I loved the tales that were told in this book, I wasn't crazy about the way the author told them. Her language is a bit simplistic and in today's vernacular. Comes across as a bit odd when telling ancient legends. But good to maybe read to kids to tell them about their heritage."
5,this CD is simpley AWESOME!,ZAO is a awesome band and it's sad that they ended up breaking up (again) and will most likely stay broken up this time. but still we have their CDs to listen to. this was their 1st be release and easyest to find. their very 1st being a slpit EP (which is now out of print) and a full length and anothing slipt and anothing full length (or something like that). their CD All Else Failed being re-released about 3 times. well this CD is 1 of the best from ZAO (well of of their CDs are 1 of the best but...). these songs are more raw hard core than the new stuff and the vocals are well....... kinda weird but really cool. give this CD a try and keep a look out for a ZAO best of album and a re-recorded cersion of All Else Failed to come in 2003.
3,"I hate to be the one to bring the 5 star rating down, but...","Although this is a decent cd, it comes no where close to as good as the other two albums...i know that the entire band (except Jesse, the drummer) left the band after this album, but i just couldn't get into the singers voice...get it if you love zao, like me, but don't expect the same band as with ""Blood and fire"" and ""Liberate"""
1,Color was different!,The description says they are multiple colors. But I received 3 gray and 3 white.They did not respond to my complaint at all.Poor customer service.
1,A great idea for a book but very poorly executed.,"This book was a waste of time and (fortunately very little) money. The reviewer that said ""mostly fluff"" was right on the money, except that he still gave it 3 stars. I bought this book mainly because I was looking for another poker book and I had always wanted to read Sun Tzu's Art of War. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. If interested in ""The Art of War"", buy that instead; If you are interested in a good poker book, buy one of Slanksy's or Harrington's. This book is littered with insights like (to paraphrase) ""when your opponent is weaker than you, attack and accumulate his chips; when he is stronger than you, retreat and conserve your chips"". Wow, would never have thought of that. Kept reading it hoping there would be something of substance to this book but was disappointed to the end."
4,Solid concepts and well-written,"This is a good book for people that don't play poker all the time. Poker pros and ""serious"" poker players (those who do play all the time) wouldn't get a lot from it. This book is very much about the mental game, and it's moreso that than many other books out there.It's a good investment in your game to buy this book."
3,Lost in translation...,"Although this book has an interesting concept, I do not recommend it for any player except for the beginner. The writing is repetitive, and somewhat shallow.If you are looking for a theoretical/spiritual/strategy type book I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""Zen and the Art of Poker,"" which helps with life in general as well as at the poker table -- helping reinforce your game and keep you balanced.Good luck!"
2,Tournament Poker and The Art Of War,I would say this book was decent but not a must have. If you have read any book on tournaments then there is not need for this one.
4,Nice but bibs but still wet through the back,They are nice big bibs but still get wet through the back. My baby doesn't like to chew on it since the teether is wider than his mouth. I think maybe it's due to the safety issue.
2,I'm in Brazil,"I've choosen a standart ship option so I havent received the product yet, therefore I cannot rate this item or service yet."
1,terrible,"poor video, bad advise, and poor quality...stories are OKAY and heartwarming...WOOFFFF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF ."
4,Gold Medal for Leibovitz,"This collection of photography at first struck me as being quite gloomy and severe. However, after a closer study of each image I realized that Leibovitz expertly captures so much of the primal emotion of physical exertion. The images range from eerily erotic to firecely competitive-- while also maintaining the dignity of each individual athlete. I'm typically not a big fan of b&w photography but here it really works. The starkness of each image allows the humanness of each athlete to really come through while simultaneously allowing the terror, agony, and glory of the human body in competition to shine."
2,Not Olympic-quality photography,"Disappointing. Technically very good, but overall lacking in originality. Most of these photographs could have been taken by any newspaper sports photographer."
4,A Rare Book about a Planetary Probe,"It is refreshing to see a book about one of NASA's unmanned successes. No wonder why the public is unaware of the JPL. This books gives a glimpse into the many obstacles Pathfinder had even before it left Earth. Muirhead tells the story in a very down-to-earth style. I was a bit disappointed in the frequent references into business applications on the ""cheaper, better & faster"" approach. At times it disrupted the flow of the book and gave an informercial taste to this book. I would also have liked a closing chpater on some of the scientific results of the little rover that gave us a very memorable Fourth of July in 1997. Overall, I recommend this tale of scientific exploration just because it gives the public information on space exploration that it wouldn't find elsewhere."
5,Great insight!!,"So THAT'S how they build a spacecraft. Great insight into the process and a really amazing glimpse into the mind of the man who made it happen. Lessons that can be applied to nearly any business today. If you only read one business book this year, this is THE ONE."
1,"Ouch, TURN THIS OFF!","When I first heard about MxPx having a side-project band, I was stoked! So, being at the HG Fest, I decided to pick up a copy from Yob. When I got home I was so excited, I popped the CD in and had a listen. It reminded me a lot like those special $1.99 chips that you can buy at the grocery store. When you first open the bag you'r like ""Yes!"" and you savor every single bite, as you git about half way through the bag, you're starting to feel a little sick so you offer some to your friends, but they don't want any. So you decide to be a man and finish off the bag. By the end you throw up all over the place and regret every buying those chips. That is how I felt when I bought this album! I hated it!"
3,artificial flavor?...,"I was excited to find green tea with earl gray flavor.I also read my ingredients.So far so good,""bergamot flavoring"".But I also happen to read Russian,and translated the ingredient reads ""bergamot flavouring,identical to the natural one"".Why use artificial flavor when the real one is easy to come by? I try to avoid artificial colors and flavors so this one was a downer(discovered it too late).It tastes fine otherwise."
5,"A ""Honey"" of a book","Hard to put down. Crisp accounts a month of tank battles against German Panzers and Italians, until he is wounded the last day from enemy fire and ends up going home. He begins as a Lieutenant in the British Army, then is promoted to Captain and then battalion commander. The American ""Stuart"" tank (the ""Honey"", so named by the Brits, because of it's ruggedness and dependability compared to their British tanks) advanced their fighting prowess. There was always the danger of the feared German 88 to deal with, so the new ""Honey"" gave them some reassurance with it's speed. There are terrifying moments of survival and the loss of companions along with wonderful serene departures. The desert battles were typically unorganized, much to do with the leadership. The Brits and the Germans alike were regularly getting lost in the sameness of the desert. Crisp did his best out on patrol, with no brass looking over his shoulder. He was just doing his job and he did it well."
5,"Profound Words, Beautiful Music, Awesome Worship!!!!","This is one of the most beautiful Spanish CD's I've heard. The words are so profound! What a psalmist!!! I use it to start my day with the Lord and it takes me right into His presence. Each song has it's own message relating to the different aspect of our relationship with the Lord. I highly, highly recommended!!!!"

4,Focal Point are west coast HxC kings.,"Focal Point's Cd Suffering Of The Masses is one the best Hardcore CD's to ever have the old school sound. They are totally heavy. The CD itself is produced very nicely. My personal favs are ""When I Die,"" ""Neglected,"" and ""Deception."" The lyrics discuss the issues of abortion, alcholism, and judging people. This CD has only one thing taking away from it and that is the fact that the CD has 2 instrumentals. They are both good songs but kind of short and would be better with some lyrics. Focal Point's(r.i.p.) guitarist is now in Training For Utopia. Check it out."
4,this book is reflection of our daily life,"Written on a daily basis, this book give us a day to day contemplation to what's happening around us. This book is best read for fathers and young adult. Its everyday different topic are very interesting. It give us another perspective to what we always do before."
5,Just what I was looking for!,GlowShift GS-U03 Universal Triple Gauge Swivel Pod came to my address fast and on time. Which make the the install fast and work's and look's great.
3,Tripple gauge set,"Inexpensive and it shows, but they worked perfectly for the application, couldn't ask more and the lasted about 2 years and went with the vehicle so I guess they are still working"
4,Fit perfectly in our drawing table!,Nice high quality paper! Fit perfectly and is great and durable for a 2.5 year old to pull out on her own!
5,WOW!,"This is a really cool cd, it's great for people that just want to have a taste of what velour 100 sounds like. The thing i really like about the cd is Amon Krist's wonderful voice. Not only is she a wonderful singer, but she's a down to earth kind of person. You'll love this cd!"
4,Great TV Themes of the 1950s,"In another Review about Hugo Winterhalter, I lamented that it was too bad that an album of his which I had enjoyed since the mid-1950s, and loved ""through the years,"" had not been put onto a CD. It consisted of the great TV Themes of the 50s. Well, as it turned out, ALL of those songs can be found on this CD, ""Through The Years.""True, they are not an entity unto themselves; and, yes,they are not sequencial, butall of these lovely themes of Jackie Gleason's show, Arthur Godfrey's, Studio One,Playhouse 90, the Coca Cola Show, I Remember Mama, Robert Montgomery Presents, The Firestone Hour, and others, can be found on this two-disc set. I strongly recommend this purchase."
3,Great pictures,"Not much of story and it does not keep my 13 month old son's attention like his other books, but the pictures are nice to look at..."
5,I'd rate HUG a 10+,"The pictures are superb. My children are grown and I bought a copy for myself, it captivated me so. Actually, I have already purchased three copies and succeeded in finding a child for each one. What a fun read! It makes such an impression on a toddler and because the book mainly consists of one word the youngster can eventually read it without an adult by simply following the pictures. All three of the children I gave the book to (after the joyful experience of reading it to them first) already owned a plush toy monkey that they immediately dubbed BoBo."
5,A big hug to Jez Alborough,My 18 mo. son wants me to read this book to him every night before bed and has enjoyed it for several months now. We make it interactive - hugging each other and reading it with his stuffed elephant. I buy this book for all of my friends with new babies.
3,Uncomfortable for my 2 year old,"I thought the illustrations and message in this darling book would delight my son. We started looking at it when he was approaching 2, and named his monkey backpack, ""Bobo"" after this monkey. But I was surprised when he suddenly wanted to stop reading it on the page when Bobo looks worried that he can't find his Mommy. He shook his head, and said, ""NO!"" and shut the book! That emotion was too much for him to handle, I guess, and we haven't picked it up since. Now he's older and we can reintroduce it, but be careful at what age you start reading this book. It's hard for a sensitive child to see the monkey's sad face if the child is dealing with separation anxiety, as many are at this age."
3,Didn't Care for It,Didn't care for this book. Not enough words. Might be good for a really young child.
2,Boring,"I found this to be a boring and uneventful book. My son, who loves books, squirms away when I try to read this book to him. I don't blame him."
2,Disappointing,"If I had realized the only word on every single page of this book was ""Hug"" I would not have bought it. My child was not really interested in it either as the pictures were not attention grabbing."
3,Excellent learning tool,"My brother and sister are just learning how to read and this book is an emense help. Through out the book there is just one word, hug, so they are really getting familier with the word hug and the sounds that h, u, and g make. A lovely board book!"
3,"Sweet, short story","My daughter loves this story. There is no text, apart from the word 'hug' which leaves it up to my imagination to describe what is happening in the pictures. I am not sure I do this absolutely right and wonder sometimes what the author intended. It is short and sweet, but not enough for a good bedtime story which means I mostly read one or two more stories which makes bedtime rather a long process. Sweet book though."
5,this is some hot shit,yo if u dont have this cd go get it couse it is a hot album and she is doing her thing now days so go help my girl ashanti out and bye her album i cant say much more so i m out go get that right and get a new one dont bye a used one help a girl out couse the album is as ashanti wolud say its bannas lol.
2,Far from being the Princess of Hip Hop,I don't know how Irv can laber her the princess of hip hop and even compare her to Mary J. Blige. I would listen to Mary's album more than I would to Ashanti's. She isn't bad at all but I can't see the comparison between the two. Honestly I'd rather listen to What's the 411 over and over than listen to this album.
1,she thinks she's brandy,Only You Can Make Me Feel sounds like a Brandy reject ashanti copies the talented female artists of the 90's but it doesn't come off right at all. I think now is the time to release a compilation CD and just do something more productive
2,"One step better than ""Chapter II""","I listned to this album via MTV's ""The Leak,"" and I was surprised to find it was better than ""Chapter II."" Her singing has improved. She seems to be keeping her cool, more so than her last album. After all that fluff, the album really is a dill. Ashanti tries too hard to be ""Ashanti."" She needs better production. Her album just sits there the entire ride - no bumps, no hills, no (wanted) acceleration... just sits. I think it is better than ""Chapter II"" since she isn't trying so hard to do something new, but since she isn't trying anything new, she's just sitting there?! In any case, her first single is probably the best track on the CD, and about 3 or 4 songs (out of 17) are decent. The album doesn't necessarily suck, it just sits there (which is sucky enough)."
2,Full of Samples,This is yet another Ashanti album full of samples from the 90's. I know most artist use samples but she could have at least went a little further back in time. Nobody wants to hear the exact same beat with a different voice and words. At least give the beat time to rest before you decide to make it yours.Don't let them-Raekwon heaven and helllove again ----scarface finer thingsso hot jodeciat lest make a better song. please leave it alone if you can't do any better!
2,Eh,"This cd is marginal at best. Ashanti copies alot of other peoples songs, or at least sounds scarily similar - track 12 sounds alot like Jodeci's 'Feenin', track 14 is from a song by Total, and track 15 is a beat from Notorious B.I.G. feat. Bone-Thugz-N-Harmony, Notorious Thugs. The only songs that are worth listening to are Focus, Take Me Tonight, Don't Leave Me Alone (my favorite), and Wonderful Remix featuring Ja Rule. So Hot starts off ok, but something happens about half way that makes me cringe.By the end of the cd I am tired of Ashanti's voice, and hurridly get the cd out of my player.Ja Rules latest cd R.U.L.E. failed to impress me as well. This was the last release from The INC. that I spent hard earned money on."
3,"""DONT LEAVE ME ALONE"" is tha JAM!!!!!","This is a GREAT album, but one song that stands out is ""Don't Leave Me Alone"" I think this is one of tha best songs Ashanti ever recorded....even though i'm not a hug fan of hers."
1,she thinks she's brandy don't she?,"She almost got it with her first single but it sounded too much like brandy's music and she still doesn't have the skills though she has the looks. Interesting album title concept, but r&b and hip hop was really much better 10 years ago"
3,Technicolour Rose,"Ashanti needs to listen to her own music and ""Focus"". After the the misguided ""Chapter 2"", she hits us in the face with ""Concrete Rose"". In my oppinion, Ashanti has the potential to create music like the early recordings of Janet Jackson. She has the unique voice, but maybe the wrong type of producers and writers. So far, from what I've heard the only songs that stand out on this cd are ""Still Down"", ""Love Again"" and ""Focus"". Ashanti needs to realize that people who buy her cds want to listen to it hundreds of times so she should put more quality songs on it and less filler tracks that you tend to skip over. Overall it's a decent cd."
3,A Step in the right direction,"I looked at some of the other reviews and I agreed with some but some others just bashed. I believe with each record Ashanti's voice has got better, but the song writing has not improved much. Concrete Rose I feel is a step in the right direction, must of the tracks on the album could be labeled album fillers but the stand out tracks are ""Only U"", ""Focus"", ""Take me tonight"", and ""So Hot"". These tracks all show what Ashanti could be capable of if she just breaks out of the just put something out mode. Overall I give the CD 3 stars, it's not the best but it does have some good sounding tracks. Besides she's already done the crappy album ""Chapter II"" you can only go up from there."
2,Bubble Gum Music,"This album is medicore at best. Ashanti is so Overatted it's ridiculus. First let me just say that this is my opinion ok so I dont need anyone coming at me talking about I hate Ashanti because I dont hate anyone especially over some music. Ashanti on the other hand could've done way better on this album. There is nothing special about any track no feelings, no song were she's rippin it vocally, nothing. Where is the passion, the ballads, the heart & soul. it's like they made a beat with a catchy hook on every song and called it a day. that is not a good album I'm sorry. she needs to come better then that or not at all. ""Turn It Up"" is the best song on the album."
3,"Good, but could have been much better.","Well, Ashanti has released 4 albums and 1 remix CD, so she's been around for a little while. Ashanti's Concrete Rose features R&B with some hip-hop trown in it. What really bugs me about this album is that Ashanti is much better on hip-hop songs rather than r&b. She did great on songs like Only U and the duet with T.I. because they were hip-hop songs. Songs like Take Me Tonight are just plain boring and generic. If only Ashanti had more flavor, this would have been such a better CD. Maybe on her next one it will feature more hip-hop rather than her boring r&b tunes. Anyway, if you like Ashanti or R&B, you should buy this, but if you like hip-hop, go pick up Snoop's R&G or Luda's Red Light District."
5,"Her best cd yet ""A Ashanti fan""",This is ashantis best cd. it is better than her last two the tracks are hot and lyrics are catchy. I love her new single only u. it is hhhhhot. IF you love hip hop and r&b; i recommend this cd even if you are not an ashanti fan but you will find yourself enjoying this cd.Keep up the good work Ashanti!!!!
1,"She's a beauty, but that's it.","I wanted to give her one more try and buy this album, especially after hearing that it was her best album. Obviously, I am truly once again disappointed. We all know that she's a beautiful young woman; but that's it. Honestly, I think a different record label, and producer with pull more out of her. Her tracks sound the same, and her vocals just don't put you there. This one almost went out of the window of my car. I kept it only because perhaps and somehow at least one of the songs will grow on me."
4,Suprisingly Good.,"I'm not a big ashanti fan, but I love ""Only U"" which made me sample the rest of the CD. Only stopped a few after 5 seconds, but the majority of the songs are good. Great ""chill"" CD."
3,concrete,I AM VERY DISAPOINTED I HEARD ALL THE OTHER SONGS TO MAKE SURE IF THE ALBUM I WANT TO PURCHASE AND THIS ONE U CAN HEARD IT SAD.....
2,ashanti albums,"why like all ashanti's songs have the word baby in it baby, baby, baby, i thoughtthe skits she put in this on was dumb she cant sing that is why noon of her albms never gotten traight 5 or 4 in a half stars.but she got her fans but how the hell is buying her cd's but ilke her picture on this concrete rose album and i do like the title."
2,I thought this was a joke,"Ok,from the days of Foolish and Unfoolish, I became obsessed with Ashanti. I loved her first CD, however I don't know what happened to that girl. Her new CD Concrete Rose which I recieved for Christmas was a HUGE disappointment. Her songs lack substance, the beats are weak, and honestly it all around sucks. I'm truly disappointed in Ashanti, and that fact that she's calling this her best work yet worries me..."
1,Murder Inc... ooppppss I mean the Inc. SORRY GUYS!,"How many times do I have to hear the same SONG! You are a hook girl, stay a HOOK GIRL! This is the reason why Back up singers don't release albums, if I want to hear Ashanti I'll buy a Ja Rule album (and hear over and over how much he just loves those hos!). Man what's wrong with the world, how come hot girls can't release good albums? You would think ""man she is fine! This album just has to be as good as she looks!"". But then my friend you are wrong. Don't say you got it cuase she is hot, that is lame, go buy a Maxim and shut up. This music is horrible, it's like a compilation of all the songs she has been back up on! Girl! STOP MAKING SOLO ALBUMS KEEP ON DOING HOOKS AND I THING YOU'LL DO JUST OKAY. Does Nate Dogg put out solo albums, no yet he still stays relevent (it ain't a hit unless Nate Dogg is on it, as that one dude said). Ashanti, keep singing hooks, if there is anything I want to get across her is this DONT BUY THIS ALBUM!"
1,"CATCHY TITLE,BORING MUSIC!","I was really anticipating Ashanti's fourth project,Concrete Rose,but boy,was I was in for a major disappointment! The lyrics are dodgy,the music is monotonous and the skits are terrible!What was she thinking when she was recording this album?It sounds like she was doing it for the hell of it and to see her name on the Billboard Charts.The only outstanding single on the album is her hit single,Only U.Ashanti has a beautiful voice and it's a shame she wasted it on pathetic material.I've tried listening to the album a number of times and I always end up in Dreamland.If you're suffering from imsomnia,buy this album and in no time you'll be out like a light.It's seriously boring."
1,what happened to her!!!!!!???????,"oh my gosh, what happened to this beautiful lady? this is concrete s**t!! ""Don't let them"" is good, sounds like ""Over"", but not as catchy as foolish, happy, baby, down 4U. whats luv, the pledge...her begining was good! she didn't wait too much to release her 2nd album, and the same w/ this one.ja and ashanti started doing very hits together but after mesmerize... it's not the same.I hope she focus her career in make real r&b;, like her first record, then i'll buy it.she is gonna release a remix album soon, i hope good joints."
4,BETTER THAN CHAPTER 2,some people say that her c.d is trash and didn't buy it since chapter 2 was trash but to make it plain and simple this c.d makes up for chapter 2favorites:still downonly utake me tonightfocusdont let themudont leave me alone(this should have been a single. it reminds you of the first c.d)freedom
2,Why does she still make albums?,"Who is buying these albums? And why? She sounds as bad now as she did when she destroyed Biggie's beat on her debut single ""Foolish"". Most artists get better, grow their voices, but not this lady. The only thing on her that grows is her weave. This album is disrespectful to the R&B community. I am sick of looks overriding talent. What ever happened to singers like Chaka, Patti and Anita? What ever happened to knowing how to sing in order to record an album? This CD is a waste of money and a headache. Listening to this nasal performance for 50 minutes will make you wish you were deaf."
5,Once again!!!!,"Ashanti has once again risen to the top! Concrete Rose is an excellent cd, she has completely won me over. I just wish she would have left the useless skits out, but buy this cd because it is one of the few cds out that are worth the money. All tracks are hott!!"
1,"Aaliyah, I TRULY Miss U ...","Ashanti probably is a nice enough girl, but where's the talent?This last full length LP just shows how limited as an artist she was. Can't sing, can't dance and can barely walk in high heels.If it weren't for the successes of Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul and Aaliyah, who weren't the greatest singers, but could hold it down as true ""entertainers"" Ashanti probably would have no career.Concrete Rose should be the end of the line for a chick that'll probably end up working a desk job at Murda Inc. in a few years.Stay away from this LP (and this kind of , dare I call it, ""music"" for that matter).Uninspired album with little to no value to the hip hop/R&B; landscape.Get a Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, Aaliyah, Monica, Brandy, Fantasia, Keyshia Cole or Toni Braxton album before you even consider buying Concrete Rose."
3,All I Ended Up Wanting Was A Single,"I like Ashanti, I really do. Loved her debut, heard Chapter II, and was left still waiting. Concrete Rose didn't capture what I thought she had (I listened to it at a music store), and I ended up buying the Only U single instead. She is still a great songwriter though, and it shows. Hope she does better, that's all I can say."
3,She's loosin her style,"The hits she's released (from this album) are still 'Ashanti' but the rest of the tracks lean more towards rap. I like Ashanti because her style IS Ashanti. She never was anyone else before but she's lost quite a bit of herself this time around. Don't get me wrong, the album's still good, just not what I expected. I bought an R&B album and ended up with half of it rap."
3,Average... should be better,"I am not an Ashanti hater or an Ashanti fan. She has talent but her cd's are always deceiving.Ashanti puts out fabulous singles but when you get to the album in itself it sort of all sounds the same.Maybe that's not her fault, its her producers and her voice (which has gotten a tad better).Some of Ashanti's beats sound similar so I wasn't thrilled. I wish Ashanti would get some real depth and get some steamy soul ballads and not just capatilize on whats hot at the moment. She is so much better.Favs: Only You, Don't let them, and U(her best work yet)"
1,What is wrong with everyone?,"Ashanti cannot sing. She has absolutely no vocal talent, and she stinks. She has a very weak voice, and her songs are all pointless, stupid love songs. I bought chapter ii, thinking that i would like it, but i didnt. Then after a while, i thought that ashanti might have improved, and so i bought concrete rose, and only u, and they stank. She is a major annoyance, and she makes me sick. She cannot sing!!!!!!!!"
3,not good,everything sounds the same as last time! no offense but the cd sounded knida out of tune and ashanti's voice wasn't that good either. she seemed like she was straining to reach the high notes
1,Ashanti SUCKS!,"I hate Ashanti so much! ""Only U""? I remember seeing the beginning of that video, she's standing on a building, saying all this intro crap, and then she's like ""it's only you"" but she says ""u"". GODAMMIT!Also, I hate her voice. Especially in that new Herbal Essences commercial. She's just whoring her music, and God I wish she was dead!"
4,Surprised!,I got this for my birthday and I thought I wasn't going to like it. It is way better than I thought it was going to be.
3,I agree,"I agree with the person who said that Concrete Rose is better than Chapter 2 because I feel the same way.But I still feel her debut was the best of her releases.Anyways I don't know how ya'll out there feel about independent R'n'B acts but if ya'll wanna give it a try, check this site out:http://www.soundclick.com/bands/7/eden_music.htm"
3,AT LEAST IT WUZ BETTER THEN CHAPTER 2,"IM NOT REALLY A BIG ASHANTI FAN BUT SINCE I HEARED ONLY U I THOUGHTY FINALLY ASHNATI IS BAK BOI WUZ I WRONG SO MUCH FILLERS ON DIS CD IT AINT EVEN FUNNY ALL I CAN SAY IS DAT DIS CD IS SOLID, BECAUSE UNLIKE CIARA SHE DOESNT WRITE HER SONGS AND SHE CANNOT DANCE SO SHE IIGHTINTROSTILL DOWN FT T.I 8/10ONLY U 10/10FOCUS 10/10 I LIKE DIS JOINTDONT LET THEM 10/10 DIS DA HOTTEST JOINT ON THIS CDLOVE AGAIN 8/10 ITS IIGHTTAKE ME TONIGHT FT LLYOD 7/10 SONG IS KINDA CORNY AND LLYODREALLY IS A HORRIBLE ARTISTU 9/10 HER VOICE SOUNDS HOT ON DIS JOINTEVERY LIL' THING 7/10 ITS CUTETURN IT UP 3/10 DIS SONG SUCK ITS HORRIBLE SKIP ITSO HOT 9/10 DIS SONG IS HOTBUCK 3000 2/10 I DONT GET ITDONT LEAVE ME ALONE 10/10 ANOTHER STRONG SONG ON HEREFREEDOM 8/10 ITS IIGHTAND DA JA RULE JOINT WE KNO DAT SONG ITS IIGHT 8/10OVERALL ITS A C+"
3,Same OL Ashanti,"This cd was aiight it wasnt here best like she said it was, she still singing about the same stuff she do in all her other songs, she needs to get original, the beats were off the hook she need to than 7 aurelius for that, there is only a couple songs on the cd i like and other than, i think she is corny and she cant sing and she need to stop 2 steping all the time."
2,Not another Album full of re-makes :-(,"I was very excited regarding the reviews i had heard of Concret Rose- which was supposed to be her Best Alblum ever...Well let me tell you - you should buy it used or bootleg cause it is not all that. It is okay for the most part, but i have to do alot of fastfowarding of tracks, i cannot listen to the whole ablbum at all... It was supposed to be some of her most orginal work ever, but it is not. There are a few ""GOOD"" tracks here besides the 2 singles they have released that are actually worth something... Trust me she is just remaking alot of songs, most that do not need to be re-made...Don't waste your money....this CD is not all that."
3,Better than chapter 2 but still dont impress me!,"First off I would like to say that i am not really a fan of The Inc. but i do like Ashanti. This is better than chapter 2 but she still dont impress me. Im just not feelin this album too much but there are some songs which I do like. I also think that theres something shady about her album name, it reminds of the book Tupac wrote, ""The Rose That Grew From Concrete"". To me, that just disrespect to one of the greatest mc's of all time."
1,HORRORBLE!!!!..No Wonder She is flopping!!,"I used to love me some Ashanti..but after her last album (Chapter 2) I lost respect for her. I mean what happened to her voice??? I actually used to think she could sing..well..erm..a least a lil bit..I will admit that her first single off CR ""Only U"" is amazing...but the beat .the music makes the song amazing..her vocals leave something to be desired. She cannot sing.. point blank...she has no talent. The world is obviously coming to an end because the girl actually has a fan base of brain washed children that feed into her garbage..Ashanti is a has been that never should have been that never will be...and I will never ever miss her once she dissapears for good. If you are looking for good music..please save your money and buy Beyonce's (Dangerously In Love) Brandy's(Afrodisiac) or Aaliyah's (Aaliyah)...and if you actually are an Ashanti fan..I suggest you go see a shrink to try and make sense of your screwed up marbles..Have a wonderful day!!!!!"
3,Somewhat of an improvement,"I really like the vibe of this album. The musicis intimate, the beats are tight, and Ashantihas a nice flow to her. However, she's not avery interesting lyricist. She's still so youngand probably will get better with words as sheexperiences more. There are a number ofgreat cuts including ""Still Down"" ""Turn It Up""and ""Take Me Tonight."""
3,Good,"This a better album than the last. It's true that Ashanti can't sing too well but you don't need to know how to hold a note to have a hot album. I like the overall album and would recommend it for purchase. My favorite songs are FOCUS, ONLY YOU, DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE (My Favorite) and LOVE AGAIN."
1,Worst Album,"Ashanti's first album, ""Ashanti"", was great, one of those albums where I could actually enjoy every song and not have to skip tracks. However this one is the exact opposite. There's probably only 2 songs on this CD that are decent. The rest of the album is weak, as in the lyrics and the beats. All the sounds sound alike-boring."
4,Ashanti Really Stepped Up,"This album I s Very great , She really Worked on this album, This beats are different but she did her thing."
2,Another disappointment,"I really tried to give Ashanti another chance after the disaster that was ""Chapter II"", but she let me down again. I gave this album a star for every song that I like on it...sad isn't it? SAVE YOUR $$. I wish that I had."
2,OK,"This album was okay, nothing to run and tell your friends about. Her first album was good, the second was okay, and this one was so-so. I like a few songs on it, it's a good thing I didn't spend any money on this album (me and my friend burned it off the internet)."
1,Still good&Wack,"thank goodness for eye candy,because Musically Ashanti is still one of the worst vocalists out here.the lyric department still ain't that deep. 7 does a decent job on the Production.some of the Music is decent,but any average Karoke Singer could pull it off.well let me stop,because Ashanti ain't even that good.she has a formula that I can respect.I respect her Hustle,but Musically she is still a one note pony."
2,Disappointed,"After hearing ""Only U"" for the first time I knew I had to get her new CD. In her intro she specifies that she is very proud of this album and that it is her best compilation of music to date.I attempted to listen to all her songs in full lenght but could NOT do it. It was a let down for me.In my opinion ""only u"" and the Remix of Wonderful and maybe one more song are the only songs worth listening to on the CD. And the Remix is noteworthy only because she had Ja Rule is on it. If this is her best yet, it was a disappointment.Nowhere near Beyonce or Alicia keys caliber as the voices of these 2 ladies cannot compare to Ashanti's. Nice try Ashanti... try again."
1,It's man!,Just another black it trying to fall in line with the Spears andSimpons of the world.Give it up cause it isn't working!On top of that she looks like a man without makeup.
2,Strong voice does not make a great singer,A strong voice don't make a great singer but Ashanti's voice just sucks! It's many singers that have limited range but still understands how to put soul in their songs. Ashanti just don't get it. She needs a little training from Tammi Terrell and Diana Ross. Billie Holiday is a perfect person of having a very limited range but she was able to put every ounce of her soul into the music. Ashanti has always have had a problem with it. She is much better suited as singing the hooks to rap songs and that just about it.She's a beautiful girl but she needs to put a little bit more soul into these releases.
1,ONLY HER COULD DO SUCH A BLAND AND AVERAGE ALBUM,"This is it for Ashanti!, two average and boring albums in a row, huh?, this one of the most medioquer album ever release, with CHAPTER II her career began goin' downhill, but CONCRETE ROSE just push it with great strength, is known by everybody the high EGO that this supposed non-worthy awarded SOUL DIVA posses...Ashanti give back the award, if you ever plan to buy this you will regret it. ONLY U is a highly produced ready for the radio that shows nothin' new, FOCUS is a horrible retro track, and the rest a pure boring ballads. And by the way YES! we are treatesd again with the anoying interludes, we don't buy the record to hear ASHANTI'S sister brag about her sister records...A WELL DESERVE NO NO NO NO."
3,JUST OKAY........NO LONGER THE PRINCESS OF HIP HOP AND R&B!,"I couldn't wait for this album to be released. I thought that Ashanti would release a banging album after her debut and sophmore effort. Over the years, an individual artist who have released many albums always have ablums that are da bomb, just okay, or whack. Every album that Ashanti released was just okay. CONRETE ROSE is no exception. Even though I commend her on her song writing abilities, CONCRETE ROSE doesn't do it for me. Ashanti needs to take a break and re-invent herself. Overall, this album is just okay but nothing to brag about."
4,Concrete Rose,"Concrete Rose is Ashanti's third main release in which she unleashes a completely different side of her talent. This is clear through the first single ""Only U"", which showcases Ashanti's ability to make a very catchy song. The album consists of many songs that have new feel to them. Not every song has the potential to be a hit like ""Only U"" but the album as a whole is a very enjoyable one to listen to. In the intro to the album Ashanti explains the title of the album and how it reveals her music as being hip-hop and R&B. If you buy the album you will get exactly that, nothing less but nothing more."
3,Concrete Rose,"I finally got a chance to listen to this, Ashanti's 3rd studio album. Well, the good news is that she cut waaay down on the needless skits, the production of this album is excellent - much better than the rushed, Chapter II but the bad news is that her vocal skills have not improved much since her debut.I'll admit, I was one of those people who really enjoyed her debut cd and a few songs from Chapter II but after listening to this cd ONCE, all I can say is maybe she should stick to the production side of this biz and continue to write hits for others. There are a few songs featuring excellent beats & production but overall, I would not recommend buying the whole album unless you're a fan and want to own her complete catalog.The standout tracks to me are: Only U, Focus, Don't Let Them, Take Me Tonight, Turn It Up & Don't Leave Me Alone."
2,Not A Fan Anymore After This Album,"I loved Ashanti's vocals and lyrics on her first album. Then I get Chapter II and things seemed to start to go downhill from there. The cd was very generic. When I heard her single ""Only U"" on her third album ""Concrete Rose"" it was great because of the rock-infused sound and unusual beat of the song. Unfortunately, that's the only decent song on the album other than ""Focus"" which is the track following ""Only U"". I honestly have only listened to the first half of the album because I can't get through it-it's so bad. She sounds different than her first album-like she's straining her voice on her songs now. 2 stars are actually generous for this review-download ""Only U"" & ""Focus"" and save your money. I know I won't buy another one of her albums."
2,Concrete Rose has lost its petals,"Now to be honest, I've never been a big Ashanti fan but I believe in being open minded and will listen to an artist I'm not thrilled with, because I know for some over the course of time, they can gain strength and become a bit more polished. I don't think Ashanti's time has come yet.From this Concrete Rose CD, I can say that there are 3 songs that I liked. (1.)DON'T LET THEM, (2.) SO HOT, (3.)WONDERFUL. I'm not really feeling the rest of it. True, she is an attractive young lady with a nice shape and as we all know, looks sell. The sad part is that there should be more than looks when it comes to selling records, talent! This music reminds me of someone who is just starting out and hasn't quite found their niche."
2,average,"ashanti is the type of flimsy singer that you understand why she became popular (because of teenage,and prepubecent girls).as a matter of fact i lost a friend because me and the girls would redicule her for liking her music.other things added to the dissolvant of the friendship but thats off topic.i doubt anybody over the age of 21 could get into this album.i listened to it cause i thought she would show growth but she doesn't.but her song writting is still childish and shallow."
4,I'm Still Waiting For Somthing Different,"Concrete Rose is refreshing and light years ahead of Chapter 2 but stuck in the Ashanti time line. As much as I love Ashanti this cd seems to lack something , the same thing that Chapter 2 lacked. Concrete Rose makes no mistakes with its hot tracks and smooth beats but gets lost in time with some rather boring and repeated songs. Ashanti career is missing new and exciting produces . Its sad to say but Ashanti will never go to the next level in her career with Irv doing most of her production. With Seven Aurelius doing some it makes it better but not excellent. She needs a new sound and to reinvent herself .I only give her 4 star because of the following tracks. Only U,Don't Let Them ,Take Me Tonight featuring Lloyd,Every Lil' Thing and Don't Leave Me Alone featuring 7 Aurelius .Please Ashanti next time around make something that I can play a year from now and it does not sound old. I will recommend this cd new or used it will grow on you ."
1,Rip off,"This DVD is horrible. The film footage sucks and the other small detail......its not in freaking english. I bought this for my fiance for a stocking stuffer, I might as well have put some coal in there, it would have been more entertaining for her. You will be burning your money by purchasing this. I would strongly suggest to the company that sells this, take this off the market, no one needs to see this garbage. And thanks for your detailed item descrition when I bought this (sarcasm), I warned any buyers out there.....the rest is up to you. I tried to help. THIS DVD SUCKS!"
4,Race Matters Review,"I had to have this book for a Philosophy class that I was taking, it has a lot of insight into the experience of Black people in America as Americans and I think it does a wonderful job at capturing what was going on during that time period."
5,Brillant-Short and sweet,"One of the first things that you notice about the book-Race Matters by Cornel West is the length, or lack thereof. However when you read Race Matters, you realize why Dr. West chhoses to make it short and sweet. Does this book need to be updated now that we have an Afr.-Amer. president? Unfortunately, no! I would like to see Dr. West create a Race Matters Vol. 2. Dr. West is not a monolithic Afr.-Amer. author/thinker. He had no problem supporting Obama for the Pres., but when he sees Obama not sticking up for the downtrodden, he's ready to offer constructive crit. That's why as a fellow author of Plain Talk-Vol. 1 I would like to request that Dr. West do a follow up to Race Matters.Plain Talk - Volume 1"
1,Harvard produced this!,"Logic-chopping aside, this book leaves the impression that Cornel West loves himself as much as he hates America. And he really loves himself."
1,No arguments here,"There is no logic, argumentation in this book, but only some feelings, complaints, and some ramblings on black culture. It may be have some value for those interested in blackism and black rights activism, but not as a serious book on the study of race and racial differences, it is simply worthless. I find it worthless. Especially when compared with other book of the issue of race: Darwin's The Descent of Man; Levin's Why Race Matters; Rushton's Race, EVolution and Behaviour; Duke's My Awakening... To name just a few of the scientific books that have been written on the subject."
3,Keep a dictionary handy!,"When you read this book, make sure that your mind is totally void of all thoughts, so that you can fully comprehend exactly what Dr. West is pointing out! Besides needing a dictionary to read it, everything in the book is true, well written and to the point. I especially love the quote from Malcolm X about race relations in America...""You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress."""
1,UNSATIFACTORY CONDITION,"THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I HAVE TRIED TO REPORT THAT THIS BOOK HAS SO MANY MARKS, UNDERLINES, HIGHLIGHTS, NOTES I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO READ IT. PLEASE ADVISE HOW I CAN GET A REPLACEMENT. THE CONDITION OF THE BOOK WAS NOT ADVERTISED AS SUCH. ONLY STATED CREASE IN COVER!"
1,I wonder...,"It occured to me as I was reading this book--written by a black racist who has nothing of value to offer to the free market, which is why his salary is based on forced taxation---I wonders DokktersWess, How many blat peoplles would be abbo 2 figure out that you title could be simply a noun phrase or a complete sentence?I's white--and I ain't yet met one yet. You?"
2,Look for this book in the Humor section of your bookstore.,"This book was wonderfully funny! I have seen Dr. West on TV and believe him to be a smart man. For this reason, I think he must have had a ghostwriter for this book. He tries to convince weak-minded readers that the in-your-face sexuality of some blacks is a thing to be praised, while free-thinking black conservatives are low-lifes. I would have given the book no stars if it weren't so funny."
1,"Race Matters, but only one side","I suggest you read this book to be remind why people especially in West's position should be more even handed and critical of their own views. He is a ""University Professor"" at Harvard but in this book of short sighted commentary he is nothing but a ringmaster for the white guilt circus. African Americans deserve better than this because so many look to him for expertise in the area of race, instead they find themselves being sold out."
1,It takes more than one side to fix things,"I think someone made a good point by referencing a Malcolm X quote: ""You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress."" However, was Malcolm X not simply holding the knife in place when he argued for separatism? Sure, his ""radical transformation"" at the end of his life saw him reverse his attitudes, but others continue with the belief that the white community is saddled with an enormous guilt and sole responsibility for the current state of affairs. Off the subject somewhat, there is another book regarding race in schools, where the author comments on the fact that it is good to see minorities form groups to foster identity-formation. In my and any other pragmatist's opinion, though, this merely perpetuates the fracturing of the human community."
4,Much better than expected,"This book was, to my surprise, very well argued and thought provoking. I expected a left-wing rant against ""white privilege,"" or some similiar nonsense. Instead, Professor West delivers a balanced, judicious appraisal of race relations and the condition of blacks in America. (Readers should keep in mind this was written a decade before Barack Obama's election). As a Jew, I appreciated his strong critique of the black anti-Semitism of Leonard Jeffries and Louis Farrakhan. To his credit, West deals fairly with black conservatives, even conceding them part (by no means all) of their argument. Race Matters is an excellent book and worthy of the praise it has received."
2,Hard to Follow,"I found this book hard to follow. His arguments weren't always clear and, honestly, I felt like he was using ""big words"" to impress his readers.I'll give him one thing: passion. I could feel how passionate he was about his topic, but all in all a hard-to-read book."
2,Lots of unsupported assertions,"So I finally got around to reading this after watching West on the Jon Stewart show a few times and liking his fearless attitude and demeanor. I was interested and even eager to like this book, but to be honest it was sloppy work. There are TONS of assertions in here that West doesn't bother trying to support with even a rudimentary statistic or poll. What's worse is he then builds his case on these premises. That's all fine if you already agree with him, but it's hardly convincing.This book needs to be at least 1/3 longer and cite some reason for me to accept everything he bases his arguments on. He doesn't get a pass because Fox News is worse."
1,A polysyllabic vocabulary does not a philosopher make.,"West completely and conspicuously evades the obvious fact that American Indians - who on average are considerably more impoverished and isolated from mainstream US culture - achieve higher test scores than blacks. He lauds the virtues of 'cultural diversity', but neglects the sad state of affairs in 'culturally diverse' areas of the United States.West pontificates to the reader about 'racism' (a word he has yet to palpably define) in a prose style that's about as smooth as Egyptian whisky.Plato, Descartes, Kant, Russell, Sartre, Rorty and now West? Not really."
3,It is OK,The sound is a little less loud but not a lot. Also my daughter complained that it was more difficult for her to know whether she was playing the correct notes or not with the mute.
3,Ssshhhh.,"Haven't used it yet, so can't really give it a rating. It looks extremely well made and should do an excellent job of muting.If my neighbors don't complain, I'll give it 5 stars!"
3,It was buy my son a mute or strangle him,"It was buy my son a mute or strangle him. I'm writing this as I'm listening to the trumpet version of House of the Rising Son for the umpteenth time. It is not as loud as without a mute. Before the mute, the trumpet echoed all through the house. Now, I can actually think while he plays.The quality seems okay. It is held in by cork and is one size fits all. I hear it fall out at least once a night. I don't mind, the kid stops playing for a minute and it hasn't broken yet."
3,Mute the Trumpet,"Yes, the mute works well. The item arrived on time and in great condition. My son does not use it that much, but there are times, when I insist on him using it and it does quiet the tone when playing."
1,Outrageous Price - $10 at Toys R Us,Please shop around before buying this or anything online. This set is available at Toys R Us for $10. I have been finding this to be true for SEVERAL toys.
5,Awed a two year old,"I was happy to see a durable carrier for all the accessories for the doll. My granddaughter got busy right away feeding her dolly with the bottle that looks like it has milk in it. Of course, she first put on the bib. it just has the usual stuff that real moms use to take care of baby. Too cute."
4,over priced,I love this item. but it is only 10.00 at toysrus.com and I would much rather pay the lower price. It says original price it 44.00 and I think thats a bit exagerated.
4,Great package,"My 3 year old received this for her b-day. She already has a You&Me doll that she loves to play with. I thought this would be good for her since she is about to become a big sister - I'm expecting a baby in 2 months. Its too soon to say how durable the toys will be but she loves playing with them. She's always feeding the baby, warming up the baby's milk, changing the diaper, etc. She especially loves the pacifier. I also bought the complete set containing the doll, stroller, car seat, and playpen which I also recommend. Now she has a doll and I have a doll and we play together and share all the accessories. I only paid about $50 for both items. A great bargain!"
5,Great potty seat and accessories for doll,"I looked at this set on here and shied away from it due to other reviews. I went in to Toys R Us today to look at another set, and this one was on the shelf for $12 (regular price, so buy it there instead of here!). The things included were slightly different, but still functional. At least you can see what's in it if you buy it in person. I got it because my 16 month old daughter is potty training right now, and I wanted her to have a potty for her doll and stuffed animals. This one is the perfect size and is very realistic. She even sat on it a few times, lol! I would definitely recommend this product to any one that wants some doll accessories."
5,All the essentails in one bag,My mom bought this for me last year and i've been playing with it ever since.it has everything that you need to take care of your baby.it has every thing used for real babies except everything is empty but thats ok because it lets you use your imagination to the extreme.i strongly reccomend buying this toy!
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"I took a chance on this package as I had read quite a few negative reviews that stated the quality was terrible. My package arrived and I have been really pleased with it. I had hoped for the bottle warmer (but didn't get one) but knew from other reviewers that you don't get exactly what is pictured. All the tubs and bottles have removable lids, great for a 3.5 year old to practice their dexterity, no stickers but painted/stamped on labels that are central. Our teddy is cute. The only grotty bit we received is a cheap as chips looking yellow plastic duck. I threw it away as it was really crappy looking. Ovherall we are pleased with our lot and feel it was worth what we paid for it. FYI - Do price check with Toys R US though as they also stock this package and are sometimes cheaper."
5,Baby Care...,"Our granddaughter LOVES this set! From feeding, to changing diapers and even some cute socks and booties! They fit her baby Chou Chou wonderfully!"
4,Silly Chaotic Fun,"My wife bought this game for her nephews, ages 9 and 10, and the 6-year-old niece. The boys love it, especially slapping the discard pile and swapping hands. ""Give me your cards!"" ""Swap! I want my cards back!"" This is NOT a game for people who like strategy or thinking. But, it is a high-spirited game for children who enjoy a little chaos and random luck. Children do not need a handicap against adults. The game is similar to Uno. There isn't a lot of reading, so even the niece was able to play. Not expensive -- it would be a good stocking stuffer for Christmas."
4,Better than we thought,"When we first started playing (one teen, two twenty-somethings, and their 50-something parents), we thought it was going to be very dull - we were thinking the blank cards just didn't allow enough variations in play to make it interesting. But to our surprise, we found ourselves laughing hysterically in no time. Not even sure why!! The ""slap"" cards almost always got past the oldsters, which of course was fun for the younger set. The older crowd was more likely to have paid attention to how many cards everyone was holding, therefore benefitting from the ""swap"" cards. So I guess it turned out to be something for everyone. It's not going to be legendary, but kind of fun."
5,Best game ever!!!,This is the best game ever! My dad NEVER plays games but got addicted to this one once we talked him into 1 hand. The laughing NEVER stops! This is great! It is highly addictive and fun! We take all jewelry off before playing.
1,"One Hit Wonders, And Thank God For That","""Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)"" is one of my all-time favorite pop singles, an absolute masterpiece of that early-70s genre that allowed the Archies to have hit singles, the Jackson Five to have a Saturday morning cartoon show, and opened the way for the Bay City Rollers and the Partridge Family.It's sugary sweet pop but it still rocks; a blend I find spine-tingling.So...why didn't Edison Lighthouse have any other hits?Judging by this ""Best of"" collection, it's because they were a terrible, terrible band.Songs like ""She Works In A Woman's Way,"" What's Happening,"" and ""Find Mr. Zebedee"" give pretension a new lease on life.A couple of things here, most notably ""Take A Little Time,"" sure sound like they were recorded for some Saturday morning cartoon. But, in the end, they're all totally forgettable."
2,Not Really Necessary,"I was rather disappointed after shelling out 10 bucks for this CD to find that the ""remixes"" are nearly identical to each other and not all that inventive. They're basically slowed-down versions of the original, which is surprising considering the great ways that Ani tends to reinvent her songs in concert. This is not to say that the songs are in any way bad, but I expected more from such an amazing artist. This is ok for completists, but if you want remixes, I'd go for the great EP, ""More Joy Less Shame."""
5,Machining a 0% forging,"This DVD is perfect for those wanting to machine a lower from a 0% forging. All the information you will need to know is in this DVD and is written from a non machinist point of view, so those with not a lot of experience can follow along and successfully complete this part.I highly recommend it."
3,is the Kindle version complete?,"What I read of ""The Tracer of Lost Persons"" I enjoyed very much. Mr. Keen is wonderful. I especially liked the first story. But I'm not sure if the Kindle version is complete. The last sentence is ""Here is the literal translation in columns:"" That's it! Frustrating, to put it mildly. My rating? 4 stars for a fascinating story and 1 star for the abrupt ending. Average: 2 1/2 stars (or 3).- posted by Poore Richard's wyfe"
1,"I think i would have like it, if i ever receive it!","Like the title says, I think I would have really enjoy this product. If I would have receive it!!"
2,NEW BLACK SILICON SKIN CASE COVER for PALM TREO 700 !!,poor silicon cover. does not hug treo properly
5,A great book and a great series!,"This is the perfect book and series for the lay-person. If you love Byzantine history, but don't read Latin, this is a great book set to have!"
3,Great book BUT,"I have to admit that I really enjoyed this book and I found it very readable and entertaining, in fact, I read the over three quarters of the book over the weekend. But I do have one major issue with the book, JJN does not seem to be aware that Atilla the Hun spent time as hostage at the court of Honorius in Ravenna. While, this admittedly is a minor issue, it makes me doubt the correctness of the rest of his information."
4,Is this all there is?,"The author's three volume work has a daunting (if not impossible) goal: to reliably recount the history of Byzantium: the longest lasting empire in history (from Constantine the Great to Constantine XI Palaeologus (323-1453 AD). Lord Norwich does credit to an ambitious project, yet much of what went on during those years was inevitably somnolent.The three volumes total 1,194 text pages, about one page per year (1,130 years) of empire. All worth reading. True to any human history, some are less than memorable years. Perhaps sources were scarce and publisher support deficient in authorizing anything equal to Tacitus and Suetonius (let alone Robert Graves).Nonetheless, this is a capital work on a neglected subject."
4,From Back Cover,"Link Templeton had sworn he'd never marry, yet he was now carrying a bride across the threshold. But Isabelle Fortune wasn't his bride, and it was his duty to protect the violet-eyed beauty from her intended groom. Link was a man who valued duty above all things - including, apparently, his own sanity. Because sharing a remote cabin with this virginal seductress was testing his willpower. And he even seemed to be hallucinating, for he kept picturing wedding scenes with Isabelle as his radiant bride... and himself as her adoring groom!5th in Fortune's Children - The Grooms series"
1,Definitely not THIS CD!,"""Memphis Wham!"" comes in an awful sounding pseudo-stereoization with all the important information (lead guitar, voice) coming out of the right channel only. Completely annoying!As all the previously unreleased bonus tracks on this CD are of minor quality and should have stayed in the vaults the original ""The Wham Of That Memphis Man!"" is the CD to go for.Terrific music in glorious mono! Fat bass and all!"
4,Does the job,Product helps clean my dog's ears and keep them dry after swimming. It has a bit of a pungent odor but otherwise works well and seems less toxic than some ear cleaning products out there. Was recommended by her vet when she was just a pup.
5,The best,"This is the best ear cleaner, it smells great and doesn't irritate my dog's skin. It works great for scrapes and cuts too. I have never bought a Dermapet product that wasn't great."
1,Irritated my dog's ears,"I have an Old English Sheepdog, Jasper, who is prone to ear infections and is allergic to California native grasses (yes, a dog allergic to grass!). We first used this product per a vet recommendation and it ended up irritating her ears (making them more red and itchy). So, the vet suggested Virbac Epi-Otic and that seems to make Jasper much happier. Some other reviewers suggest soaking a cotton ball and squeezing the solution out into the ear canal as more tolerable for the dog than squeezing it into her ear canal--I'm going to try that out because Jasper definitely doesn't like having the bottle squeezed anywhere near her ear. My vet also recommended that you don't have to worry about putting a decent quantity into the ear canal and then you should massage the ear to give the solution a chance to break up the debris in the ear before you let the dog shake it out or if you wipe out the ear canal with a paper towel (big dogs)."
5,Best dog ear cleanser ever!,"I have a dachshund with chronic ear issues. Dark brown smelly wax in ears that can't be linked to yeast infection, mites, any other infection. He just has long droopy ears that are impossible to air out. I used this product twice a week for only 2 weeks and the issue is completely gone! Now I use once every 1-2 weeks for maintenance and he never itches his ears, rubs them on the carpet, they don't smell and the redness is gone. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Definitely recommended to anyone with any type of dog....if it worked on Moby, it will work for you."
4,three lovely songs of whimpy pop rock,this EP takes me back to middle school when nobody was making music like this (except delta haymax)and nobody was listening to it (except me). love it. tidal wave is such a feel-good thing of beauty (as are the other two)
5,Touring with Klank was fun,"This is an excellent album by klank, Darren really captures the angst of trying to understand modern day christianity, Great samples and guitar riffs, I think more could be done with the vocals, but maybe Klanks new material that he is working on will capture more melodic content."
2,"Pants OK, Seller STINKS!","The pants are probably pretty nice but the seller STINKS! Very ""loose"" about shipping and communication. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
5,DERRINGER BOTH BARRELS ARE LOADED ! GET IT ON CD WHILE YOU CAN!,"I have alway thought Derringer's ""Romantic""(released 1980)album was his best! I made a copy to CD of this from my album and even had the pleasure of hanging out and having some drinks with Derringer's bassist Kenny Aaronson who played on this album and I made him a copy of it too. He signed my album for doing it and I still have it. What makes this such a great CD is that it included another great long forgotten album by Derringer. From the opening track ""It Ain't Funny"" through ""Midnight Road"" and rockers like ""EZ Action"" this is one to buy while it is still available. The other album featured on this CD is Face to Face which has one of Derringer's best songs ""Let The Music Play""! If your a fan, you have it and if you like 70's rock with an 80's twist check it out."
2,Big Letdown,The stories were okay but EVERY PICTURE WAS OF THOMAS AND ALL THE PICTURES WERE NOT THAT VERT DIFFERENT AND THE PICTURES WERE VERY SMALL!!! Little kids that dont read yet will be very diaappointed
5,Definitely worth buying,I bought the floor lamp first and I liked it so much that I bought the table lamp. They look great in my living room.
4,Really Attractive Lamp for a Small Price,"After looking for weeks for an attractive lamp that was fairly small but still used a 3-way bulb up to 150 watts, I was amazed to find this one. Money was not really an issue, but when I saw this for such a low price, I was surprised. The size and color were perfect. I took a chance, ordered it, and was very pleased when it arrived. It has an expensive, elegant look. The only reason it did not rate 5 stars is that the shade had a stitching flaw; however, I was able to turn it so that you don't notice it. The lamp has garnered many compliments, and no one has a clue how little it cost or that it did not come from an up-scale store!"
5,Pretty Lamp,I love this lamp! It looks so pretty on my chest! Who ever sees it loves it.This was a great buy.Thanks
4,Interesting dynamic on the Black Church,"As the author of a new book on Race called Plain Talk, I decided to read as many books that I could before writing Vol. 2 of Plain Talk. One of the books that I brought was Race Rules. I had favorites and not so favorites in this book. Some may not be interested in the million man march or the dynamics of the lack of feminist influence on the march. However, you may be interested in MED's introspective rendering of the inner sanctrum of the pastor's circle. I won't give it away, but MED bares his soul. I also enjoyed the discussion on O.J. and what it said about our society. In my book Plain Talk, I also examine the polarizing aspects of this whole episode, as well as many other events. There is something for everyone in Race Rules. Enjoy.Plain Talk - Volume 1"
1,One star too much,"absolutly worthless!!! If you wish to learn Egyptian Hieroglyphs on your own, get How To Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs by Mark Collier and Bill Manley,and a hierolyphic dictionary. After you master Collier's book you can move on to other books like Gardener's Egyptian Gramer. Stay away from this DVD, they even left out two symbles in the alphabet one the flax symble which is very important, used in the name Ptah. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it less."
3,The Italian drop_kick.,The first time I heard this band was from a bootleg live recording. I thought their sound was kicka--.I was certain thatI could not go wrong buying their studio recordings. I think one may have to listen several times before they like this. I say this cd sounds very similar to Dropkick Murphys(a watered down version). This is with the exception being that the language is all in Italian(no English). I say that is different.
3,Pretty skimpy,"The late A.L. Barry was the President of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. This is a short (less than 200 pages) introduction to the book of Acts. It is easy, even pleasant to read, but I found it pretty skimpy for my tastes. Probably better as an introduction for the new reader of the New Testament book."
3,Ahmad Apple Tea,"The tea bags are convenient. There is only a slight whiff of apple because it is overpowered by the other tea. It is good to carry with me, but at home I prefer the instant Apple tea for it tastes just like the apple tea I drank while visiting in Istanbul, Turkey."
1,are you kidding?,"don't pay more than $4 for this tea, available in many middle east store for $3.A real rip off for $16. The tea is not all that great, good brand ."
4,Wonderful book for hosting a fairy party,"This book was very helpful in hosting my daughter's 6th birthday Fairy Party! It had wonderful ideas, invitations to punch out (although I had to photo copy to make more as it only came with 4), and a whole section on ""manners"" when hosting a fairy party. Out of the 3 books I bought on this subject this one was the most useful and my favorite."
2,Very little information,"This book is beautiful, but not worth the price. It has very little information on having a fairy party. There is better, free information online."
2,There's really not much to this.,"There aren't very many ideas.Or pages!The best part were the stickers.Cute idea, but you'll get as much inspiration from reading the title as purchasing the entire book.I wish they'd put more effort in.It's a great idea."
2,Book is just 28 pages,"There are only 4 recipes, and those are far from original. And the entire book has only 28 pages!"
4,Inside the mind of the artist,"I appreciated this book as it gives a different perspective on Mucha's works. Being mostly a collection of pencil drawn sketches, it lets you enter the creative process of the artist, while other books I own just present the finished work.Really useful for who'd like to understand his approach to drawing."
4,Drawings of Mucha by Dover press,"this is just fine, drawings of Mucha and his artwork of table ware and dresses and girls and sketches of posters. none finished like in other books, a nice cheap series published by the only people who remember the arts of the past Dover Publishing. i have more Dover art books than any other publisher. i also love Alphonse Mucha the master of Art Nouveau. i have sense high school, now 40 years ago. well done."
2,Nothing New Here,"Sure the book is easy to read - because any woman could write it. I found very little here that any person with common sense would not realize on her own. For example, the author says that most women who learn they have cancer learn on the same day that they will need chemotherapy and will lose their hair, and therefore link the cancer and their hair loss forever. Is this even noteworthy?Also, while the author obviously tries to address the way different cultures and ethnicities view hair, I found that she was disproportionately addressing certain ethnic groups. She talks a great deal about Mexican Americans and lesbians, but there is little mention of any of the many Asian cultures or other Latino cultures in this country - or in other countries, for that matter.Fluff."
3,OVER AND OVER!,"The maximun delivery of Brenda K Starr came as a storm to many radio waves back in 1987. Her rendition of ""I Still Believe"" the original, sounds so real and soulful, Brenda's vocals sounds in pain and the meaning of the song takes that approach in the most perfect way. The debut album of this latin chanteuse enbodies the dance spirit of the era, soaring between latin freestyle and pop-R&B, the blend of this two makes this album so unique, the album highlights relie on the leading single ""I Still Believe"", ""Over and Over"", ""What You See Is What You Get"" and ""Breakfast In Bed""."
3,Freestyle's pop princess proves solid songs last forever.,"Brenda has powerful sexy vocals which makes this pop version of freestyle music a lasting success. Of course, her original recording of ""I Still Believe"" makes it her signature song, but for 1987, songs like ""What you see is what you get"" and ""Over and Over"" are infectious and still fun. She is even more electrifying live, a show you won't want to miss."
1,Personal Pencil Sharpener-battery operated,This sharpener is a piece of junk. The batteries aren't powerful enough to keep the blades all but barely moving when you insert a dull pencil and it completely stops when you insert an unsharpened pencil. I absolutely DO NOT recommend this product and I sure wish I hadn't given it as a present.
4,A zesty romance seasoned with a well-plotted mystery,"HONEYSUCKLE ROSE moves at a fast clip, immediately drawing the reader into sympathy with the beleagured heroine as she is fired from her job, breaks up with her fiance, and wrecks her car--all in one day. She's pulled from her wrecked car by a Dept. of Transportation investigator who is trying to prove she's the mastermind behind a ring of hijackers. The mystery unfolds with satisfying twists and turns as the romance between the two heats up. This is well-written: fast-paced and entertaining, and the villain's identity may surprise you."
4,VERY NICE,"This was bought as a birthday gift for my daughter, she really loved it we wished it was able to be water proof or able to go in the shower and what not. But its very lovely and we are very happy with it."
4,"Tell Us More, Zippy!","I read this book immediately after finishing A Girl Named Zippy, and was pleased to find it has the same humor and draw as it's prequel. While Zippy is told entirely in a child's voice, there are numerous parts where Kimmel ventures into memories told from an adults perspective - she tells us about things as she interprets them now, illustrating that she is skillful in eloquence as well as wit and humor. I hated to reach the end of both books! Both made me wish I remembered more from my own childhood, and made me think about what my kids will remember from theirs."
4,She got up off the couch,"Loved this book! As an older college student who was terrified ""to get up off the couch"", I could completely relate to what Zippy's Mother was going through and applaud her. This book was about every family and highlighted the subtle family dynamics that make every family unique."
4,inspiring,"This was a good book, inspiring. It was a really fast, easy read. Get this book, but read ""A Girl Named Zippy"" first."
3,She Got Up Off the Couch,"Cute, but not as good as Zippy. Read them back to back and, after devouring Zippy, interest faded before the end of Off the Couch"
5,"Zippy's Memoir, ""Chapter 2"" Just Leaves Us Longing for More!","In this ""sequel,"" Kimmel continues sharing her story of growing up in small town America. ""She Got Up Off The Couch"" picks up where ""A Girl Named Zippy"" left off. Not surprisingly, Zippy is growing up: she's no longer smart but niave -- she's smart and realizing that the world is not just full of fun and magic, and things are not just peachy within her family. Her mom, virtually frozen on the couch for the entire period covered in Zippy, decides to go to college. Dad is not supportive. The family seems to be disintegrating. Although darker than the first installment, ""She Got Up Off The Couch"" is written with the same wry humor and charm. We can only hope that Kimmel will, again, bow to her readership's requests and write ""Chapter 3."""
5,She Got Up Off the Couch,"Haven Kimmel is such a gifted writer. I was thrilled to read another book by her and her life in Mooreland, IN! It is such a REAL story and she doesn't seem to miss any details. You will enjoy this book so very much. I hope she goes on to write more books about herself and her life. Thank you!"
5,book review,"Just a great book! Great to know 'what happens' to the family. Funny and genuine. Well written, interesting perspective, - brings back memories of the '70's."
1,not worth the price,"I found this shallow and not realistic... how many of us really knew what our parents or other adults, for that matter, around us were thinking or even how they were relating to us or anyone else? Sorry, not my cup of tea."
1,product was 3 yrs out of date,"taste was accrid as product was so far out of date. seller wouldn't respond to my complaint, but amazon refunded purchase price,"
4,Dog Shoes,"I bought the all terrain dog shoes for my Great Pyrenees who drags his feet when he walks. He rubs the pads off them when we go on longer walks. The shoes stay on really well, but after using them just a couple times, he rubbed a hole in them already. He stumbles a little bit when he wears them on his front feet, so I only put them on his back feet. Overall, they're pretty good."
1,Recieved Wrong Chou Chou Doll,"I ordered a 19"" Chou Chou Baby Doll dressed in solid pink.I was surprised to see a purple and white checkered with purple solid sleeves.Can't find it any where else. Now it may be discontinued or on back order. I'm dissapointed that the order was wrong. The one I recieved is nice but it is not what I ordered. Rheba,Dissapointed"
4,My fav Razor Skyline,"This is my fav. Razor Skyline. With this album they picked up a new drummer, onyx. The_gun is an great guitar player and Karen's voice is beautiful.to comment on someone else's review, they are both from Seattle AND San Francisco. 2/3 live in SF 1/3 lives in Seattle."
5,Fun for everyone!,"This game is great fun for all age levels! My husband and I are in our 60's, and we have two grandchildren ages 8 and 10 1/2. We all love it! It's almost addictive - you can't put it down! One of the features that I really enjoy is the music that plays in the background while you solve the puzzles. They are classic tunes in a music box style. Many of the graphics and drawings have a Japanese theme, but you get use to it. I would recommend this DS game to anyone!"
3,Fun !,This game is fun for about two weeks and then it loses it's appeal but that's just my personal opinion.
4,"Great game, just wish there were more puzzles","This game was so much fun....while it lasted. I wish there were more puzzles to solve, that is the only complaint that I have."
5,Beautiful product,"I am very happy with these bookends..they were a gift for my boyfriend at Christmastime. They came in the time specified, in perfect shape. They are very high quality."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"After reading so many books that are filled with facts, statistics etc. It was REALLY fun to sit down with a lighthearted book that really made me laugh. I already knew the odds of a pregnant woman over 40 giving birth to a baby with Downs Syndrome, and why it's not OK to drink while you're pregnant. This is not the reason I went to a book by Alan Thicke. If you just need to be entertained and relate to the stories he tells, buy this book!"
3,A lighthearted quick read.,"I purchased this book at a time when I couldn't find a book that gave men advice on what to expect during the pregnancy process.This book was lighthearted - each chapter (about 20-25 pages long, on average) goes into each month of the pregnancy, and there are some funny celebrity quotes and funny stories of the author's life that made me chuckle. The quotes and the stories have a purpose, as they go with each month's ""theme""; also, they provide levity to each chapter so that it reads quickly. Also, there are some good points to each chapter, enough to give a general primer of what is happening in each month of the pregnancy.I've read the book twice (it can be read in 1 or 2 sittings), enjoyed each time I read it, but will be passing it along to other first-time dads, as I don't have much use for it anymore."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Perhaps this glue would be alight if it were new, but the tube I received is probably five years old. The glue that came out after some intense squeezing had the consistency of silicon glue and had the adhering power of mucus. Elmer's needs to stick to their white glue but not with this glue. (Pun intended)"
4,Strong songwriting highlights the 97's first effort,"After hearing their more recent albums, Old 97's ""Hitchhike to Rome,"" sounded raw and unfocused. Before long, though, the songs came through. One by one they kept creeping into my head, drawing me back to the album to hear the source. I'll admit the delivery is suspect in some cases (the brilliant ""wish the worst"" for example). Some of these songs need to be released in their present live incarnations to do them justice. For now just sing along real loud and resist the urge to drawl out that second verse in ""Wish the Worst""."
1,Perhaps useless for most people,"The journal samples chosen are so dry and uninteresting. The author tries to teach the obvious which an average educated adult reader would know. This is kind of book you pick up in a bookstore and read 5 minutes or 10 you would put down and move to the next. Since I bought this book, I obliged myself reading it from time to time for several days; not a single time I found it intriguing or instructive in anyway. If you think yourself a person with adequate education, you would know how to write and keep a journal without using this book."
4,a strike against sexism,This is a heart rending book as one reads about the sexism that pervades Middle Eastern culture. el Saadawi is a courageous woman who dared to fight against the system. This book was no doubt a great controversy in her homeland of Egypt and quite possibly still is. The autobiographical tones are apparent which makes it an ever sadder tale. Freedom as she argues should exist for all--both men and women. The way her upbringing taught her to feel ashamed and inferior is horrible. But it is equally inspiring that she had the courage and fortitude to triumph over these overwhelming odds. Occasionally humanity does rise above the ugliness. This is one such triumph. It is poigant but also a worthwhile read.
2,the new mediumship,"it's a very short book that seems to make for more of an article than a book. The topic coverage is stilted and very basic - too general to be adequate for a serious study of the topic. This book was required reading for a course I am taking and the only reason I bought it was that I could not locate it anywhere else for free. I would refer anyone else making a study of mediumship to other authors, such as Elizabeth Owens; particularly, How to Communicate With Spirits. A book called Mediumship Explained is also good. I think it is by Harry Edwards (amazing books by him on spiritual healing, by the way). Another very thorough book on mediumship is A Guide to Mediumship and Psychical Development by E.W. Wallis."
3,Read it but don't buy it,"This book is a good book for learning about semiconductors and semiconductor processing. It is intended for upper-division college students in materials science, electrical and chemical engineering. The book is fairly easy to read, the math is not too complicated, and the text is accompanied by a lot of figures, tables, references, and charts. Topics covered include crystal structures and defects, different methods for growing semiconductor crystals, analysis of semiconductors, diffusion and ion implantation. There are homework problems at the end of each chapter, along with example problems worked out within the text itself. There are many mistakes and typos in these examples, so I would not buy this version, but wait for a newer one."
3,pales compared to the last 3 albums,"Let's be candid, this album is not as well-produced or infectious as the prior 3 Los Amigos Invisibles albums. I love these guys to death, I'm not trying to be negative. But I find myself having no urge to re-listen to ""Superpop Venezuela"", whereas I always loved to revisit the Luaka Bop releases. Los Amigos Invisibles are an incredible live act, so perhaps this new material is better in concert.If you're looking for a new act that has some of the same inspiration and creativity as prior Los Amigos Invisibles releases, you could do well by picking up The Pinker Tones debut ""The Million Colour Revolution."" They are from Barcelona and have a lot of the same good vibes LAI once had."
5,she is gooooooooooood! MUSIC GOOOOOOOOD~!,"This singer is a real exponet to the cuban music...like anothers singer,like Celia Cruz,MARIA ELENA,is good,beautiful voice and grand sense of the beat!The orchestra is very very good,...remind me the past years in Havana,with the good music and hot nights!this is a really a jewel.....is a great representative cd from CUBA....."
5,"Castles, Secret Passages, Witches and Old Curses!","What more can you ask for in a medieval mystery? This is by far the best Catherine LeVendeur mystery! In it we have Catherine and her family going back to the home of her mother because of a summons received by her grandfather. When they arrive they find a castle that is full of her relations, but it is also full of secrets. It seems that no one is telling the truth. Catherine and Edgar, along with her sister Agnes and her ward Margaret, set out to uncover all the secrets and therefore solve the family problems that everyone thinks are being experienced as a result of an ancient curse placed on their family. The book is a page-turner! There is a lot of action going on, and of course a time-constraint as well, since the well in the keep is going dry. Reading this book is like taking a time-flight back to medieval France."
3,not as fun as her other works,"I started this book with the same excitement that I have read all of the Catherine LeVendeur books, but this one left me sorely lacking. It didn't seem to have the same flow or intelligence of most of the other books, nor was there as much mystery as there was merely adventure. By now I am totally invested in the different characters populating her books, and I definitely wasn't disappointed to see more interaction between the siblings. However, as another poster put it, the ending was so disjointed it was almost like someone else wrote it after reading the last page of the previous chapter. It also left me with the feeling that this was the end of the series, which I hope is not the case.I visit Sharan's website www.sharannewman.com and there was no information about upcoming books, but I certainly hope this isn't the end of Catherine LeVendeur. I want to see how their changing roles can mesh into a new story. Don't leave us hanging Sharan!"
3,This one's weird,This tale seems inconsistent with the previous books in the series; like there was a good idea in here somewhere buried under a lot of weirdness. Too many loose ends and unresolved issues hanging when the story stopped. I really enjoyed the previous LeVendeur stories and hope the next one is much better: this one still has me scratching my head!
2,Happy,"This was not the best of the Catherine Levendeur mysteries. Somewhat far fetched. I didn't care for the setting. Not too clear who the well-women were. Nice ending about the mother, though."
2,Not nearly as good as her previous work,"I loved the early novels in this series, and they were a great inspiration to me in writing my own historical novels,Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: JohevedandRashi's Daughters, Book II: Miriam. But they've become less and less interesting, with this most recent one a downright disappointment (especially the ending). I doubt I'll even read the next one."
2,Nylon fork for use in teflon pans.,"Not happy with this fork to long and flimsy. Cannot scramble eggs with it because it is too long, cannot turn bacon or meat because it is too flimsy."
4,Times like ours were times like McClung's,"Originally published in 1915, just after the start of the First World War, In Times Like These was one of McClung's early works. But reading the book 85 years later the reader might get a feeling of elation -- how far we have come, because women have the vote, after all! -- or deflation as we realize how far we still have to go. As McClung says, ""The world has suffered long from too much masculinity and not enough humanity..."""
3,Austria bedding,"I received the bedding today and was surprised by the color. The picture makes it look green and pink/peach but the colors are all very brown. Also, the material on top of the comforter had a bunch of fly aways which I thought was odd considering it had such a high original price tag. The patchwork design is beautiful, but just beware it doesn't look anything like the picture!"
3,Overall Pleased,"The colors in this comforter look slightly different than pictured (which worked out for me) as the shades look more grayish on my browser. The comforter has more green or the green is more prominent. Also, i agree with the other review in that I did expect the quilt to be heavier as this item has a listed price of over $200.00. The quilt is a little light weight."
4,comforter set,"Great comforter! The colors are a little different from the picture but for me they still go with my room. Received it quickly too, standard delivery."
2,Kill-a-Watt power rated 15 amps but this cord is about 7 amps,"Kill-a-Watt Caution. I checked with the shipper and this cord has a lower power rating than the Kill-a-Watt you may be using it with. To avoid over-heating the cord be sure not to use with refrigerator, washer, dryer, air conditioner or other large power using appliance. Kill-a-Watt is rated 15 amps (1875 VA) and this cord is smaller, about 1/2 the amount of the Kill-a-Watt. We want you to be safe and avoid the classic ""extension cord fire"" from over-heating a cord."
4,Immensely useful for such a simple idea,"The quality of the cabling is good, the prongs were slightly bent but work well otherwise, and generally speaking, this is a very useful set of mini-extension cords to prevent electrical cord crimping. I especially like the right-angle cord with the male prongs; the profile is very flat and particularly useful for re-routing my subwoofer's power cable to be as close to the wall as possible without damaging the power cord itself."
4,"Good, but not perfect","very good product, but not perfect. the two plugs that are slanted and flat cannot be placed on outlets with the ports being lateral to each other. the plugs bump and the left one cannot be placed. other than that, they are rather beefy and good."
4,Plug in convenience,"I mostly use these plug extenders with power strips. For example, I have plug-in adapters for charging cell phones, brick sized AC adapters and a night light plug-in at the same power strip. Before these cables, I had to unplug 1 or 2 wires to charge the cell phone and plugging in a night light on a regular basis. Now, everything fits without any moving around. Some furniture are seated against some outlets and the flat outlet comes in handy in those situations. The only downside is you can't plug in any heavy duty appliances into them, but usually those appliances do not use a brick sized adapter anyways."
5,"Very Clever, Very Useful","After a couple of years of owning these, I've found them indispensable. They're well-made, come in a useful variety of styles, and frequently prove to be useful."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this lens specifically for the widest angle setting, as it is a LOW COST product option. If you do any shooting at all in HD format (16:9) you will have vignetting at the widest setting, therefore reducing the usable field of view. In fact, there is a slight vignetting even in 4:3 format. Again, the vignetting is only at the extreme wide angle. You can get around this by zooming in slightly. My best guess is that the ACTUAL factor is closer to a 0.6X than a 0.5X.I am not particularly concerned about lack of ""zoom thru"" focus. I bought it for using the wide angle in static shots. (I think most of you would agree that we amateurs overuse zooming anyway.)I think for the price the image sharpness is OK. Barrel distortion is minimal and certainly not objectionable.I might add that my camera is a Canon HF200. Users of other cameras may not be experiencing vigetting."
4,does the job on the cheap!,i love the Kenko 0.5X Wide Angle Lens! i needed a cheap lens in a hurry (a lens that also wasn't a complete piece of garbage) and the Kenko lens came thru for me.i use the lens on a pv-gs120 camcorder (3ccd mini dv) and it's the perfect wide angle lens for that format. i'm not going to say it's the lens for you if you're all about the hd... but for a short video project (which was made specifically for mini dv) this was the wide angle lens solution for us. it worked great! you get MUCH more in the frame.CONCLUSION: if you need a good wide angle lens on the cheap... this one works. it's not junk. and it's great for mini dv stuff or other non-HD camcorders!
1,glass bottle??,"This lens is the biggest pile of do-do I have come across.I had VERY low expectations, but it fell massively short of these expectations. The bottom of a coke bottle would so a better job. It is hard to describe how pants this is. The centre could not resolve an elephant at 100ft, and the edge (where not vignette-ed out of existence) is even worse.OK- I am new to video- coming from a still photo (Canon L /Hassleblad/ Contax) background, but by no objective measures could this be regard as anything other than a paper weight.Never have I had such low expectations of a product and it fall so massively short of them - the feeling is like buying a Trabant for a laugh and not even be able to get it to start so you can give your friends for a spin.If you consider buying this - take $30, wipe your bottom with it, and flush it. You will get a better use of $30.A pitiful piece of glass."
5,KENKO WIDE ANGLE GREAT FOR CAMCORDER,"I love mine. It is great with my sony handicam. Really gives me a nice image, and adds so much more action to my vids. Especially in tight locations when I want to show more of the action. Or outdoor landscapes. It has great build quality. And a zoom through ability. Its lens is razor sharp through my video cameras entire zoom range except for the highest zoom in. Only the last 10 percent of the highest zoom, gets blurry. From the wide range and through most of the zoom it is great! Awesome for independant film makers using video or DV cams. Gives a nice 35mm quality - in that you can fit more on your screen. You will love it."
3,Ok lens-- use carefully if your camera is widescreen,"I'm using this on an Panasonic HDC-SD9 camcorder. Projecting my footage on a 98"" screen, I can see no reduction in resolution using this lens. However, there is some barrel distortion that may be distracting, and there is vignetting at my camera's widest setting, which limits this lens's usefulness."
3,Lens Quality Issue,"I bought this lens for my Sony XR500 HD Camcorder. Although it seems sturdy enough, the lens seems to degrade the quality of the vid slightly. But of course, I'm not spending $150 to $200 for a higher quality one, so for the money, it's ok."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The edges curve in, and the colors are messed up. BUT it's cheap and you are back .5x. Not a waste of money, but close."
1,Big & Sturdy with Pouring Spouts,"Works as expected. Only four stars because the handle is designed for overhand grasp and not underhand grasp. Also the ladle is top heavy (handle is much heavier).Updated 03/30/2012:Well it turned out the balance of this ladle is too heavy on the handle end and therefore makes its use clumsy and uncomfortable. We hardly use it in the kitchen and it has earned the status of the ladle of last resort. Meaning, we will use it when it is the only clean ladle left standing."
4,great pack,"my son wanted a new backpack for school he loves military looking items so I showed him this on. he loved it, it arrived on time a was priced right. his friends want one now. it was a great pack for the money and I would recommend it to any one."
2,not a small version of an alice pack,Zero padding on the the shoulder straps and they cannot be adjusted while its on. The only reason im not sending it back is that it fits my 9 year old daughter and she wants it
5,Awesome Pack,This bag was much bigger than I thought it would be. Has a large size compartment in which I was able to store 4 medium sized water bottles as well as two days worth of day clothes. Front pockets held everything else I would need for a day trip and more.
3,It does the job.,This is a fine pack for a kid age 10-13. The straps are weird and it sits on your back in a strange manner. There should've been some sort of chest strap for the shoulder straps to provide support and the shoulders straps probably need more adjustment options.
2,falling apart,"the cotton is good, and it looks ok, but the metal tips fall off all the straps, and the metal sprockets fall out of the pull holes."
4,"Frothy, fun, and funny","When three ex-boyfriends take the plunge into the state of presumed marital bliss, Angie begins to wonder what's wrong with her. Now there's Kirk, and Angie starts becoming mysterious in an effort to nudge him in the right direction. Then, when it begins to look as tho her plan is working, she has second thoughts..."
3,a little too preditcable,"This is the story of Angie, an actress and customer service rep.It's a typical chic lit read, about how she's 31 and wants to marry herboyfriend, so she goes off on thiswild ride of popping his top off so that he'll propose to her.Right from the start you just know that Kirk isn't the one she should bewith, even though he's ""perfect"". In the typical chic lit formula she goesthrough all the phases of discovering her true self, and deciding if Kirkreally is Mr Right, or if she just has it in her mind that he should be.She asks the question, does she love him enough? To which she normallyreplies yes...when in the reality the question is does he love her enough toallow her to be who she wants to be?While I enjoyed the story, it wasn't one that I loved. It was too obviousin a lot of ways. However, the last 40 pages or so were the best in myopinion. There is a second story involving the same characters which willbe read shortly, and I hope there is ""more"" to it than this one."
4,"An ""Engaging"" Tale","Is it possible that a girl can ""loosen"" a guy up so much that he's marriage material ----- for the NEXT girl he dates? It is for Angie DiFranco, main character in Lynda Curnyn's new Red Dress Inc novel ""Engaging Men."" Angie really begins to rethink her dating habits once the THIRD in string of her former boyfriends becomes engaged and ready for marriage. Is it her? Is she the one that makes them ready for the alter, just not with her?Angie's current boyfriend, Kirk seems to be just what a girl needs. He's been ""loosened"" by his former flame and Angie thinks that her luck may just be changing.""Engaging Men"" is a fun trip into the dating world where marriage seems to be the answer to Angie's prayers. Makes you wonder if it's a bad idea to hope and wish for something a little too much.A fun beach read --- really easy and not too difficult for the summer days on the sand.Cheers!"
1,"Not Expert Advise, Bad for Some","I bought this book, followed the program, and gained weight -- more than 20 lbs. it's still here, years later. I think this book is ill-advised, out of date, and maybe a onetime moneymaker for the author. If you have an eating disorder, go to a therapist specializing in such instead of relying on what you might find inside. Anorexics, compulsives, bulimics need the care of a certified professional, not this book."
3,Nice idea in theory,"Hirschmann brings up some good points that only compulsive overeaters may understand. The book was informative and placed overeating in a new light. It definitely has a unique approach to overcoming overeating. Unfortunately, the approach may become very expensive. The book contained a program which may work for some but it could take years to overcome. I would recommend both of Kay Sheppard's books instead."
5,Awesome,"Great book, a must read for those of us that have spent our lives on the diet rollercoaster and wish to get off."
3,Question of Body Acceptance,"This book and the premise that diets don't work is truly enlightened. However, the authors don't address the issue of discomfort regarding body acceptance. I would like to dance, play volleyball, hike and kayak. Yoga is something that I would really like to participate in. But the size of my stomach prohibits many movements and my weight aggregates my already sore and damaged knees and ankles. How can I accept, appreciate and love my body when it prevents me from doing what I want to do? Also, this book and it's companion When Women Stop Hating Their Bodies, are redundant independently of each other and the second book is just a repeat of the first. So many words. To suggest that I don't like my stomach sticking out because I ""shouldn't stick out in a crowd"", is ludicrous. It gets in my way! A shorter, simpler book is the Fat Fairy-Godmother's Eat All You Want book. It says the same thing in much fewer words."
1,Incomplete Info is Extremely Dangerous,"There is valuable info in this book for the compulsive over eater. It is however, incomplete. In it's incompleteness it becomes a real health danger to those following the program but not understanding the effect of insulin on the body and on hunger. This book would be great if it took in to account how food acts on body chemistry and brain chemicals. Without that knowledge and info this book has a great potential for harm. As part of a program that also takes in to account body chemistry and insulin I think this book can be extremely useful. By itself it is an excuse to overeat and be fat. Taking care of yourself and educating yourself fully on the effects of food on your body is my idea of true self acceptance. If you are already extremely overweight stay away from this as your sole source of information."
2,Overly clinical and tough to get through...,"While this book held a few bits of helpful information, I found it overly clinical and had to force myself to plow through it. The book was written after years of clinical research and studies done on overeating disorders... It should be interesting and informative, however, the findings are presented in such a dry non-narrative fashion it reads as technical survey after survey after survey. Booooooooooring.I didn't get much out of it. If you are looking for some serious answers about overeating....keep looking, this isn't it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"May work for some, just not for me","I read this book in about 10 years ago with hopes of finding freedom. I ended up gaining weight and began throwing up to counter the effects of my eating. I do not blame this book in any way for my behaviors, it just ""co-signed"" my thinking and told me what I wanted to hear...that I could eat anything. Eventually, I addressed my food issues from an addiction standpoint, which proved successful for me.I wish anyone reading this success in their recovery.I would recommend that they go through this book with the guidance of a therapist or other professional."
4,Not for those who love dieting!,"Like another reviewer, I think this book is dangerous -- to those who make a living telling the overweight that they can't trust themselves and that some foods (the ones they want) are B-A-D.Instead, the authors address the concept that if we listen to our own bodies and only eat when we're actually physically hungry (as opposed to bingeing or just plain old pigging out) we'll overcome the need to pig out in the first place.I've tried this and it's amazing -- when you know that you can have anything you want, you suddenly get very selective and I found that it was the taboo-ness of certain foods that made them attractive. Now, because I know that I can eat whatever I want -- and because I don't eat if I'm not physically hungry -- I'm much healthier physically and emotionally.I can actually ENJOY eating!"
5,Most helpful self-help book ever!,I can't live without this book. I recommend reading it every few months to not lose focus or fall back into the diet trap again. If you do what they write about in this book you will see that diets definitely do not work! I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know where else to turn for weight loss or to recover from food or diet addiction. Anyone who eats compulsively really needs to read this book!
5,"Finally, something sensible!","I had already been using some of the principles of the Weigh Down Workshop but found it a bit judgmental. This book helped me learn to care for myself properly and not be so critical. As a result, I lost 60 pounds and took it back off after a pregnancy. I'm pregnant again and not worried about shedding the baby weight. I really appreciate a wholistic approach to this issue!"
5,Good book to get you started,"If your just starting out in racing, I highly recommend this book. The sections that are most interest for me were the chapters on driving lines and the chapter on how to read tire temperatures after coming off track. From my view-point since I am the set-up guy, reading tire temps is invaluable. Other than the driver input, this is the only other input you have at the track that tells you what the car is actually doing. Great info in my opinion with this book."
2,Disappointing,"I did not feel stretched at the end of this video. Only one repetition is done for most of the exercises. I'm a beginner but the exercises are too easy for me. Also, the video is no fun. The background music is borrowed from a dentist's office and nobody smiles."
2,Disappointing,"Are teens really this obsessed with sex and relationships? A very sexualized account of teen high school romances. The plot was completely predictable, no surprises. The most disappointing thing is how casually sex is treated, no encouragement toward abstention, the author promotes the idea that high school girls will have sex, so just accept it and keep condoms handy. The author promotes the idea, ""Who wants to be a virgin?"". Being a virgin is so uncool. Save your time, there are many, much better books out there to read for teens and adults who like the YA genre. This is just a book full of predictable teenage high school drama."
2,Bor-ing.,"For the most part, I was bored with this book. It got better near the end, but then it was over. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you."
4,"Alternate Book Title Here: Great Story + Cheesy Ending = Chick Flick Waiting to Happen *No spoilers, promise*","I love the fact that Sara really does seem like that one girl who's smart AND pretty, and Tobey acts just like a guy of his age. I thought the development of both characters was impressive and being in Tobey's mind was a funny and entertaining experience. A few awkward moments in the hotel and in her room but other than that it was a good read. Also, brownie points to the author for choosing the name Tobey cause my favorite superhero/nerd is Peter Parker (played in the first 3 films by Tobey Maguire)."
2,Eh,"I've never read any of Susane Colasanti's books before this one. And After reading this one, it's safe to say that I have no intention of reading another of her's. It was really boring, really I don't even remember it that well; that's how much effct the characters have on the reader: none."
1,This book is TERRIBLE!!!!,"I am very disappointed and cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would like it. The language is awful. I am half way through the book and am litteraly ready to throw it in the garbage(which I never do) because I can't stand the characters saying that something is ""mad wrong"" or ""like"" totally this or that even one more time. The funny part is that these characters are supposed to be intellegent! Intellegent teenagers DO NOT say ""like"" before every other word and DO NOT use the term ""mad wrong"" or ""mad"" anything!!! I am disgusted with this book and author and would not recomend this to any teenager. Lets show children and teens how to speak well and not dumb them down and make them think that it's ok to speak so poorly. I have read plenty of wonderful YA novels, but this one falls very short. Complete waste of money. Sorry about the rant, but it was that bad and I feel duped."
2,tired of the same old story.,"This book was boring for a while. I think it didn't get interesting until halfway through it. There was a lot of language which was boring. I could relate a little to the book since I too grew up in NJ and fell in love in high school. At the same time I really am tired with reading about people having sex, but at least this one made it more realistic of how a girl would feel if her boyfriend has already been with someone else and you are a virgin. I just really think it isn't worth reading since there is nothing that truly stands out about it"
3,good but highly inappropriate,this book was very real. but it used a lot of profanity and the characters was highly involved in sex. i wouldnt recomend for younger readers. but a great book for older readers.
5,When it happens gets it right,"***spoiler alert/parental note***From my perspective, Colasanti sends the right message to teens. Don't have sex until you are sure that it is the right person, you are in love with them, you trust them, you feel comfortable with them, you are ready, and you are protected from unwanted pregnancy. If you do that, then your first time can be beautiful. (The book doesn't suggest that the first time is pure bliss. Sara's girlfriend had already warned her that it does hurt at first when the boy enters you.)Yes, Tobey and Sara make love. It is not described at all. However, there is an earlier scene where Tobey's father barges in when they are on Tobey's bed and Sara is on top of him wearing only her bra and panties. The father just apologizes."
5,BEYOND AMAZING BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this book so much ! the way the characters connect to each other and the flow of the story is beyond great ! i think that Toby is soooo kute !!!!!!! i totally recomend this book for anyone ! its ASWOME !
2,Not worth your time,"The writing in this book is very thin -- as are the characters, the dialogue, and the plot. I found it boring and a bad read. Instead, I would recommend Sarah Dessen's books. Dessen's books don't feel like a waste of time, which this one did."
2,When Sex Happens,"The writing style of this author is not particularly good. The plot line is not at all creative. However, I'll give the author credit: her writing does create a strong sensory appeal, by using descriptions of sounds and sights and smells.The subject matter of this book concerns me. The whole focus in the second half of the book is sex--will they have sex? Or won't they? The book gets very lusty. I don't care if you're an adult or a teen; should sex be the central focus of a romantic relationship? Aside from physical attraction, the two main characters have a relationship based on things like enjoying the same music and liking mustard on their burgers. That's deep. I wonder what the title is referring to--when what happens? A good relationship? Or sex? Sex might be a valid topic for teens, so maybe the sex subject isn't what bothered me so much. Sensuality combined with shallowness is what got to me. Yuck.I wouldn't offer this book to my kids as a reading option."
5,Amazing!,"I LOVED this book. I felt such a connection to the characters that I didn't want to return it. The way it's written is so cute because you can see what things are important to Sara and what is important to Tobey in the way they tell the same story. Also, I like how big things are mentioned casually, like the two of them just forgot to write for awhile because something big had happened. It almost makes you jealous of the relationship that Sara and Tobey have- I wanted to call up by boyfriend right away and make him tell me everything about himself. It's a great book for any teenager especially those who are head over heels for someone. (And the author is totally nice!!)"
4,"When it Happens is ""something real""","When it Happens is about two seniors in high school, Sara and Tobey. As each of them have different focuses, they couldn't be more different. Sara is concentrated on getting into NYU, while Tobey is concerned with winning Battle of the Bands. But Sara's other goal is to fall in love. So when Dave, the school player, asks Sara out, she couldn't be more thrilled. But when he begins to pressure her for sex and their relationship to go faster, she realizes she doesn't want to be with him anymore. Luckily, Tobey's other goal is to make Sara fall in love with him. As Tobey slowly wins Sara over, their relationship turns into ""something real."" But Sara soon finds out she isn't the only girl in Tobey's life.When it Happens has become one of my favorite books. I believe it captures the first love relationship in the most perfect way. This book is perfect for teens and is the perfect love story. I couldn't give it more praise.TYLER!"
3,Good flow,"OK, I must say that I'm a 38 year old that has a 12 year old daughter. I wouldn't have her read this book. I'm almost done with the book and I've read some of the other reviews. I feel that the book is light fare and easy to get through. I think that I like how the main character decided that ""something real"" was more important than the IN CROWD. I think that the theme of the in crowd and the decision to have or not to have sex is VERY important in a teens life. I can say for myself that during the age of 17 and 18 with a boyfriend of the same age that was always a constant battle of wills. I don't feel that this book went overboard with that theme. The book addressed college applications, getting good grades, looking towards a future, loyalty to friends, etc. I would say, give this book a chance.Update: my picky 12 year old read this book after me and enjoyed it."
5,Perhaps his finest book,"I believe David Richo to be one of the most profound & insightful self-help authors out there today & that's a wide field indeed---& seemingly wider by the month. This book is a great gift & as with 'The Five Things We Cannot Change...', I've paper-clipped so many pages for ongoing study, that it won't close properly !I hope to meet Dr. Richo some day to simply thank him in-person. Highly recommended."
3,Much conversation about sex and relationships.,"Much conversation (it's Rohmer) about sex and relationships which 14 year old Pauline contributes to only occasionally. She wisely listens and observes until finally being sucked into the vortex of games played by the adults. Since it's Rohmer, everyone behaves relatively civilly and everyone emerges intact though a bit more damaged by life than at the start."
4,HP external flopy drive,"The item was sent promptly and was well-wrapped. It would have been nice to get some written instructions as to how the device connects to the hardware and interacts with the software. While it might seem self-evident, in reality the interaction between the floppy disk drive and the computer hardware and software took some fiddling around before it could be made operable. Why is providing complete, literate and accurate instructions with technology devices such a difficult task?"
3,For Beginners Only,"I was disappointed in this book. While the cover clearly indicates the intended audience is between Intermediate and Advanced, I'd place it pretty close to Beginner. It is really geared toward the person who knows enough about VB to make some things work, but wants to refine his/her coding style. If you haven't learned this stuff by the time you reach Intermediate, you've probably already developed a lot of bad habits.Also, the reference section just seemed to be filler. Why should a style guide have a keyword reference? It takes one third of the whole book. If I wanted a keyword reference, I would have bought one. What little valuable information he adds could have been done in 20 pages instead of 150+.As long as you want a book that is geared closer to beginner than intermediate and you don't mind some fluff, then this book is okay."
2,"So So, Nothing Special","This book is just a little bit better than Visual Basic Design Patterns. It doesn't even inspire me to rewrite my review about visual Basic Design Patterns. Which I will use again for The Visual Basic Style Guide:Well, the title of my review pretty much says it all. I read the whole thing in one sitting, and haven't looked at it again. I didn't really learn anything about visual basicthat I didn't know before. Perhaps later, after I read a book that actually teachs you visual basic - I may go back to it for some pointers.This book can easily be overlooked with no ill-effect..."
1,Terrible shipping,"The shipping was terrible. There were no proper buffers, so I received it all broken.The idea is good, but the glasses are not very nice either."
5,Very cool.,I think that the the best parts are when Drea is half asleep and when Micheal W. Smith sings the song he wrote just for the tape.
5,Great show that 4-13 girls love--proven in our home!,Excellent story and great work! All three of my daughters liked the movie alot--each different things. A great movie to own!
5,Buy This Album! Chris and Rich are unreal,If you buy this album it will be the best thing you have ever invested in. Chris and Rich Robinson are the best musicians of this time. The Black Crowes are the best band of this time and just the two brothers stripped down acoustic are amazing. I was at the Brothers of a Feather concert in Atlanta and it was the best music i have ever experienced. Their harmony is like no others out there. The jam at the end of Thorn in my Pride is an amazing blusey jam. From start to finish there is not one dull moment in this album. Rich is an amazing guitar player. His solo songs such as Forgiven Song and Leave It Alone are amazing. Every cover song is amazing. this is a soulful masterpiece. if you love the crowes then buy this album.
5,Robinson brothers make good,"Everyone has been waiting for these guys to release this after they recorded those shows. And they did not disappoint. MAGIC ROOSTER BLUES, COLD BOY SMILE, DARLING OF THE UNDERGROUND PRESS are rare and unreleased songs that make thier debut here. My only compliant is that the dvd has like 6 or 7 more songs, very sad that they couldn't have included more tunes on here that are on the dvd like MY HEARTS KILLING ME."
5,The finest authentic instrument set of Mozart's Symphonies,"My wife and I were married at Mirabel Palace in Salzburg ""The City of Mozart"", so of course Mozart's music holds a special place in my heart. I must agree with the reviewer below: Pinnock/English Concert have the superior sound over Hogwood/Academy of Ancient Music. Although not as extensive (48 symphonies on 11 CD's as opposed to Hogwood's 72 tracks on 19 CD's) this contains all the essential Mozart symphonies that one could hope for, and the price is accordingly less (around $80 as opposed to $150). The Hogwood cycle are analog recordings (digitally mastered) from the 80's when all the sound bugs from authentic instruments had not been completely worked out yet. The Pinnock cycle are superb digital recordings from 1993-95, presenting a vivid ""sound stage"" where you feel as if this sublime orchestra is playing right there in your room. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Not postnatal pilates,"The title is misleading. The video is 30 minutes of prenatal pilates, with only 10 minutes of postnatal, and some of that includes infant massage. The prenatal component also requires a bunch of props, including yoga strap, block, ball, and a few other items. The postnatal requires a strap."
5,Great,This band is one of my most favorite Hardcore bands Altho this album is second to Blessed are the persecuted is still Kicks butt their bass palyer isn't as good but their vocals and guitars make up for it
3,ok,"this album is alright,but ive defenintaly heard better.the reason i tkink its pretty mediocre is because ofits music.it is hard,which is cool but it doesnt have a rythm to it.i like hardcore music that has a guitar that makes alot of uniqe sounds in it.like embodyment,zao,project 86 etc....this guitar playing on this album does not have a definitave sound on any of its songs except for the bonus track.the bonus track is the best track on the whole album.its a remake of the song the religion lies which was on there last album.the vocals are cool.i like high pitched screams.te lyrics pack a pretty good message.but i think this abum could have been much better.the song braile sounds real cool guitar wise but is way too short.its barely a minute long.all in all i think this album is ok....but i suggest you listen to it before you decide to buy it"
5,Beautiful stunner,"This multi-coloured CZ bracelet caught my eyes because it's dancing with vibrance. The multi-colours are captivating & the CZs are well-cut, sparkling & thick. The workmanship is good with smooth finishing. It's glamourous looking & can dress-up any outfit instantly. It's a one-of-its kind design & I can't find it in any other website. I'm fortunate to own it."
3,"Ordered this thinking it was a different ""detangler"" product, but would recommend",but it seems to be working just fine and a little bit goes a long way to help defrizz through this winter season.
5,Best product to detangle!,"I started buying Lanza hair products after discovering them at my hair salon. My daughters and I have long, wavy hair and we do sports so our hair gets very tangled often and this product makes the tangles brush out much more easily than all the other products we've tried--and we've tried everything out there for a detangler-conditioner! The price is good too compared to the others!"
4,a Magical Journey,"Ms. Jones takes the reader into the world of the Chrestomanchi in 4 wonderfully woven tales. Anyone who read the other books in the Chrestomanchi series will be enchanted to rediscover old characters and be interested in the new. I found that the works were masterfully created. It was wonderful how all the different worlds of kind of come together and explore new territories. Seeing characters like Cat, Antionio, Gabriel de Witt and Roberts Mordecai was great fun. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone."
2,After Reading the Chrestomanci books...,"This is rather a let down. The stories aren't nearly as detailed, and I didn't find myself caring what happened to the characters at all. Compared to the other books in the series, this is terrible."
5,Floor puzzle mania,I was a little weary at first but helping my daughter do this floor puzzle is so much fun and she loves it!
3,It's a puzzle.,"My two year old daughter loves the picture, but the pieces don't exactly fit together easily. She has to struggle to make them connect and that makes her think she's putting the wrong piece on. I even struggled to make a few pieces connect and stay connected. It'll probably break-in over time, but they need to remember young kids are putting these together so the pieces should slide together without too much effort. Other than that, it's a typical paper puzzle. It'll be OK until the first time juice gets spilled on it."
5,Bug Fan!,"I got this for my four year old. It doesn't come with a picture guide to put it together, but it isn't hard. My daughter can even put most of it together by herself. Since it's a floor puzzle she loves to put it together and run across it and it stays together. We have lots of fun looking at all the bugs and counting them."
3,Not what I expected!,Lau Kar Leung is the king of kung fu movie making. The only one who comes close is Sammo Hung!I am a BIG Lau Kar Leung fan. His screen presence is amazing. I was very disappointed in this film though. The fight scenes were weak and the acting horrible. The only reason I continued to watch this film was because Gordon Li and Lau Kar Leung were in it and I haven't screen a recent movie with them in it in years.The other reason is because I'm a BIG SHAW BROTHERS FAN!
2,Why not just burn 20 dollars?,"Maybe I would like this movie if I were young and stupid again. The fight scenes were pretty good. Gordon Liu was great as always. However, the ""comedy"" portions of the movie were terrible. You'd never know by the cover that this movie has a plentiful amount of mediocre Chinese ""comedy."" It was unfunny and stupid. It completely ruined the movie for me. 4-stars for the fighting, 2-stars for the movie."
5,a classic in the field of religious thought,"Jung was so impressed with this book that he mentions it repeatedly, particularly for its coinage of the term ""numinous."" Even the Christian absolutism hiding in the wings doesn't manage to obscure the wisdom and value of this psychological study of religious experience."
4,Great audio book for car trips!,"Never have I heard a better dramatic reading of any book than David Hyde Pierce's reading of ""Foudini."" His choices for each voice seem exactly right, and with a light touch added great poignancy to the more tender, serious moments. My husband and daughter and I listened to this while driving from Chicago to Boston for Thanksgiving. My daughter, 8, was so enchanted she insisted on hearing it three times. (The section with Freud's cat engendered some interesting and delicate discussions!--why was Grace the Cat ""viggling""?) Some hilarious moments. As both a cat and dog lover, I think the author gets the mind and heart of both species just right."
5,Need a good cry?,"This is one of those great books that make you behave in a manner you really don't think you should. Towards the end of the book I was nearly sobbing, which is pretty embarrassing to admit. Cat lovers will be amused and moved by the view from the cat's eye, of it's world. We sometimes forget how they might see our actions.I highly recommend it, to all animal lovers."
5,For cat people,"This is one of my favorite books of all time and I have given it to several cat lovers over the years. This year's recipient said she kept forgetting, while she was reading it, that the narrator was a cat. For myself, I can say it's the only book I've ever read (and I've read a lot of books) that made me laugh and cry SIMULTANEOUSLY. Foudini, Grace, Sam, and the human beings--Foudini's Assigned Person, whom he calls Warm, and her husband, Pest--are all unforgettable."
3,Disappointing!,"I love and adore cats! I love reading about cats! But, this book left me so disappointed! Don't get me wrong Foudini was adorable. I enjoyed his voice as well as that of HIS dog. They were sweet friends and I truely adored them both. But what in the heck was the author thinking!! First off, her time line was a bit askewed. Foudini's people had owned Foudini for at least a few years before they had their own child. Then the child grew up and moved away. I will assume to college which would make him at least 18. After the child moved away Mr. Foudini jumped on their new cat Grace and fathered a batch of kittens!! I can't believe an author would write about unnuetered and unspayed cats! I'm sorry I cannot relate or condone the breeding of housecats. All the unwanted and destroyed animals in the shelters these days and Foudini is out fathering kittens at a ripe old age! I was disgusted really! That whole ending basically ruined an otherwise very sweet book!"
5,Incredibly Magnificent,"Klank's ""StillSuffering""was the first Christian cd I bought coming out of my Satanism. It really helped me, and for once I didn't feel like every Christian was ridiculing me. He really knew what he was talking about. Some people may not be able to handle the lyrics if they've lived a sheltered life. He explains all that at the beginning of the cover. He was magnificent."
5,The best industrial band ever!!!!!,"This is the best industrial band ever.I have seen Darren ""klank"" live before,and its just intense.I recomend it to anyone who loves industrial or heavy metal.The lyrics are deep and the guitar is hard.Darren is so kewl i met him and he is a kewl guy."
3,Thank G*d this is NOT a Chr*stian CD!,This is some heavy industrial metal that does not promote the values of Chr*stianity but rather screams out in anguish at the irony of life. For years I was turned off by this release because Chr*stian Industrial Metal just seemed like an oxymoron to me but what a fool I was for being so close-minded. Even if he was spouting off on Chr*st it wouldn't matter because the music kicks so much ass.
5,This is GREAT industrial music !! I strongly recommend it.,One of the best industrial albums I've heard. I first heard an unfinished track on the Demo-lition II album (various artists...I think by R.E.X.) and I couldn't play it loud enough. It rocked and I had to get their stuff. Can't wait for more !!
5,Klank's music is the best industrial music i have ever heard,"klank,darren, is awesome his lyrics of his songs has helped me through so many tough times. His music tells me that it is okay to be independent but most of all his music helped me in that way. Darren is an extremely good guitar player and his lyrics have meaning and depth to them.The 2 times that I have seen them in concert.well what can I say, the stage presence is absolutely incredible.After talking to him afterward i find out that he is not stuck up like other people that have that kind of talent. That in him I respect. He look on the world as it really is. He is not a Christian wrapped up in a liitle holy bubble or so to say. if you like mean guitars and great vocals check out klank. (of course this is only my opinion of him that I get through his album and talking to him)"
3,Moderately Liked it,"I thought that it was okay but there are some other bands that I think have better vocals and guitars. (e.x. Living Sacrifice, Blindside, Mortification { Not the Triumph of mercy }, Zao, Training for Utopia, Stretch Arm Strong, Spitfire, etc."
2,there is only one song that actually shows some talent,"TIME is the best and only worthy track on this album,for one i dont see how people cant help but smile when they hear this cd,it is old school 70's retro synthesizer's with hard metal guitars.it is goofy,the emotion that the singer is trying to get across is dround out by the utter weirdness of the music.then you have the HELLRAISER sound bytes throughout the entire cd which are at the beginning and the middle and the end of almost every song.i cant detect any darkness or emotion in this cd,TIME is the only good song,the singer does a little picking at the end of the song,when i heard that i thought alright guitars solos.i thought i was in for a surprise,but that is the only song he does that on.go and get the song TIME ,that is the only thing worth listening to."
1,great music terrible lyrics,"This is NOT a Christian CD- there is no hope and is only filled with hate filled lyrics- not a sliver of Christ! Believe me I wanted to find the hope- the music is amazing.Example: ""Hate pulses straight through my vains Every time I hear your name... Forgiveness has been denied You have left me scarified"" (from the song ""Scarified"")Romans 1:16 ""For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."""
2,An Otto Accident,"No doubt Klemperer was a master,But surely Mahler played it faster,Lasting forty minutes past an hour,With intonation that's often sour,Poor Otto's Seventh is a real disaster.Jeff Lipscomb"
5,a tiddy dols strumpet,"A very enjoyable book that every woman and some men can really get to grips with. It held my attention from page one to the very end, i really needed to find out what happened in Jennifers life. Really looking forward to the sequel with great relish."
2,Disappointed,"This case does not offer the full protection for the KRZR that many would like, particularly on the front of the flip. It also offers very little protection on the sides. In addition, when opening the flip the cover tends to ""pop"" off from the pressure of the elastic. So, if taking a photo you must reposition the case. The multidapt system on the back also makes it seem to be a little ""lumpy."""
5,this is a great swinging hot buzzing disc you cool catz and kittens!,"I picked up this disc one day when I was somewhere and have played it and played it! What are you waiting for it's hot and tight and a listening & dancing delight! Cripes you can even get one for a penny, a penny? It's a deal at twice the price. Really, just a penny? What ever the cost the greatest cost is not having this CD!!!"
5,Great Movie:-),"I have this movie both on VHS & DVD & I must tell you it is darn good...I don't know what these other viewers are complaining for, because this movie follows true to the book on these actually killings...I personally love Michael Madsen & this movie just goes to show you that he can play any role given to him...A must buy for any Michael Madsen fan & even if your not, it's still a GREAT MOVIE:0)..."
2,Boring. Slow. Silly. Full Of Holes.,"A bad story idea poorly executed. I do not know how the director managed to coax such a reasonable cast into performing in this inconsistency-laden yawn-fest but one may only assume that hard cash dollars were involved :) The story is so full of holes as to lead you to wonder what the hell is going on.. How does Jamie Luner's character, Naomi, manage to spend so much time with the escaped con, Tyler Pierce (played in lacklustre-style by Michael Madsen) when her other half has threatened to kill Pierce and has seen Pierce and Naomi plotting behind his back? Why does the Naomi character leave herself open to attack by the clinic nurse who is obviously involved in the killings? Why did none of the psychotic nurse's colleagues spot that it was obviously her local patients who were being killed? As shallow as a woodland grave, I'd steer well clear if I were you."
1,GARBAGE,COULDN'T GET PAST THE FIRST STUPID HORRIFIC SCENE. WHAT A WASTE!ANGELA SAID: THIS KIND OF MOVIE MAKES THE WORLD WORSE.
2,SLOW MOVING AND PREDICTABLE,"SACRIFICE is another entry in the cache of director Mark L. Lester. Michael Madsen once again tries his Bruce Willis imitation, and although he's a little more effective than usual, his weak performance drags the film down a good bit. Bokeem Woodbine offers little in his role as the frustrated FBI agent; Jamie Luner is luminous but does some pretty stupid things in the movie; Deborah Shelton (Body Double, Dallas) portrays Masden's ex-wife and though I've always enjoyed both her beauty and skill, neither is evident in this whiny role. The movie is slow moving and little suspense is introduced or maintained. It could have a lot more impact with better performances and direction."
2,Rent don't buy. Movie about an anti-abortion serial killer,"Jamie Luner sublimely transcends another bad movie. Otherwise,there's nothing to recommend it. Summaries you may read areinaccurate. For example: ""The daughter of an ex-conbecomes the latest victim to a serial killer eluding the FBI. Herfather and boyfriend join together to track the killer."" Wrong,the boyfriend is hardly involved.The story takes place entirely against the backgroundof abortion. There's some bad acting (the drug dealer inparticular) and characters act in unlikely ways. Why doesn'tNaomi yell out when she has the chance? Why does Namoi have so much free time?Also, abortion clinics are usually very careful whom theyemploy."
4,The Saddlebred,"The pictures in this book are quiet gorgeous, and the Family Tree lines impressive.The history compiled within this book is equally impressive spanning over more than 400 years.This book gives you an overview of The Saddlebred Breed and its background as well as it's uses in society. I would classify this book as a History of the Saddlebred if you will.When I purchased this book, I was looking for a book that would not only tell me more about the breed itself, but how to work with as well as train this type of horse. I was also interested in learning more about the general characteristics, personality, habits & riding styles of this breed, more that the actual history.This is an excellent ""coffee table"" book for horse lovers. I personally was looking for a book that contained more day to day information about the breed, although I did find the material in the book very interesting and somewhat helpful."
3,"Breezy, fun reading","If you can find THEY CALL ME DIRTY in hardcover, it is worth buying just for the cover photo. (The paperback version cropped the picture, diminishing the effect.) Author Conrad Dobler, renowned NFL penalty-piler, once punched Mean Joe Green in the stomach and lived to tell about it in THEY CALL ME DIRTY, a breezy, fun read. Football maniacs will appreciate Dobler's ""Tough Guys Hall of Fame"" chapter."
1,Useless without the text,"The works in this album have little or no music at all, they are basically in the Singspiel style. Only a short summary is presented in the notes, and the German text is nowhere to be found in the internet. If you can't follow the dialogues - one of them in Bavarian dialect -, this album amounts to A very frustrating two hours."
1,This is the wrong cd listed!,"I made the mistake of ordering this title several times before realizing that the listing is incorrect. Apparently, the reference number for Limited Brazen Sound matches up with something entirely different. So, if you order it, you will receive something else! Be careful!"
2,Searching for the Best Sunscreen,"We ordered this sunscreen after reading the Consumer Reports review which rated this product as one of the few that are very good at blocking UVA. It was almost impossible to squeeze out the product from the bottles and when it did come out it was extremely clumpy and did not spread easily. My husband contacted the manufacturer and received a reply that they had an issue with one of the batches. So they sent us two bottles to replace the ones we had received, except they sent us the kid's version. The new bottles were better but still had small clumps that were very difficult to spread out. It took a lot rubbing to get it to look decent (i.e. not all white and clumpy sitting on top of skin.) We will continue our search and try the next two items on the Consumer Report list... Banana Boat Sport Performance Active Dry Protection Spray and Coppertone Sport High Performance Ultra Sweatproof."
3,lotion,It is a little to thick for me was hard to put on your body needs to be a little more running for me
3,LUMPY,"The product may work well for a sun block and does not seem to wash offwhen swimming or sweating,very little if any eye irritation.It's a waxy substance.I have to clear the dispenser opening after removing the coverwhich includes a second nozel opening every time I use the sunscreen, which is every day.the opening on the tube is clogged every day and needs to be cleared with a toothpic.the sunblock contains hard lumps which are too hard to rub on to the skin, andit is necessary to pick them off the face and arms.Perhaps my product is old, and coagulated as a result."
4,NATURAL AND WORKS WELL,"I only gave this 4 stars because of having to wait 30mins for it to dry before going into the pool. I really like that is Oxybenzone-free, paraben-free, fragrance-free; Safe for sensitive skin. I use it on my 4yr old as well. It does work well in the texas sun."
3,New Formula is oxbenzone and paraben free,"I just bought this in a store and it is labeled on the pkg ""Oxybenzone and Paraben-Free"". It does have Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide. The exp date is 3-13, so maybe you got an old formula. I can't rate its effectiveness, though, haven't tried it yet."
3,"not bad, not great","I looked for a sunscreen that wasn't full of chemicals (the kind that react with skin to form the sun barrier) so that's why I tried this sunscreen.Aquasport was just ok, not great, but not too bad either. It appears that it's a formulation with a sun block powder mixed with an oily substance.You have to shake it a little to keep them together, but they do stay together while applying.There's no white residue, which I liked.What I didn't like was the look and feel of being oiled up. I looked greasy and it stayed that was for about an hour. I prefer a drier feel so I can put on my bathing suit and coverup sooner.I burned at the beach, but only mildly."
3,"Ok, but greasy!","This product has pros and cons. On the plus side it is a spray on sunscreen free of harmful chemicals, which can be hard to find. It does not leave a white residue which many ""natural"" sunscreens do. It is also worth noting that this one contains the same ingredients as the ""kids"" version and last I checked this one was less expensive. The biggest negative for me is that it is very greasy, which I imagine is how it gets its water resistance. It was fine to use before a run, but I would be hesitant to use it with clothes that I didn't want to stain because it doesn't absorb. I wanted to try it on my son but don't want grease stains on his clothes and on my furniture. Also, when using outdoors any dust or dirt sticks to you because of the oil on your skin. I probably won't buy this again."
2,Terrible sunscreen,"I was really excited when this sunscreen arrived, I had been searching for one with the supposedly safer zinc oxide. First off the bottle is poorly designed, it becomes very hard to squeeze the sunscreen out. I had to unscrew the cap and widen the hole with a tool! Then applying it is not fun at all, it doesn't spread easily and has a weird texture. Lastly, this is a terrible sunscreen for workouts. It basically blocks your pores so your skin can't breathe properly. As soon as you start to exercise, every place you've applied the sunscreen will start dripping with sweat and then your skin will look milky white. This happens even before you begin to exercise rigorously. I definitely do NOT recommend this sunscreen."
2,Not what I was looking for!,"I bought this Sunscreen lotion on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. I took it on a recent cruise and found that it was so thick, it was difficult spreading it over my skin. This might be a good product as far as sun protection, but if you can't run it in, then it's no good to me at all. Will toss this in the trash."
3,weird but effective,"this screen is pretty effective but it’s really thick and once you put it on, you immediately start sweating profusely out of every pore."
2,Too Thick,This was highly rated by Consumer Report for UVA and UVB protection. The major problem is that it is very difficult to spread evenly. It has somewhat of a thick course texture. I went back to NO-AD 45 SUNBLOCK which is rated just as high. The NO-AD is also very easy to spread and a less expensive.
3,It's okay but too oily,I bought it for my kid's summer camp. I thought the spray type of sunscreen could be easy to put on face or body. This product satisfy my two requirements - one is natural and no harm for kids and the other is spray type. I believe it's natual and should be better than others. But the spray type is not much easy to put on and it's too waterly. And also it's too oily. I will not buy next time.
4,greasy but works,"This is a good sunscreen - relatively non-toxic (per Environmental Working Group), but somewhat greasy and smells like slightly funky oil. The product goes on white and needs to be rubbed in to become clear again. It leaves a slick in water, but seems to hold up well. Used on head, neck area and usedQuikGel Sport Spray SPF50 4.7ozon body. burned a bit on body, but no burn on head and neck."
1,Did not work,"I tried it with my DIRECTV HR20 and my Samsung Blu-ray player. Neither worked either together or with the other unplugged from the switch. The remote did not work either. Maybe it was the battery, but since the unit didn't work, I didn't bother trying a different one. No instructions except on the back of the box. No support number and no troubleshooting hints or website. Even for $47 you would expect it to work."
5,warm brilliance,"Velour 100 succeeds in the traditions of Lush and The Cocteau Twins; they produce very full, across-the-frequency-board mixes while keeping the overall sound balanced and clean. Anyone who has engineering experience knows how difficult this is. And on top of it all, there are a slew of great tunes here, ranging from more a more upbeat, alternative flavor to slower, melancholy dream dirges. I particularly like the short, electronic interludes in between songs; they remind me of My Bloody Valentine albums... A strong and mesmerizing effort from Velour 100. Hard to find, but worth it. It remains one of those hidden gems I dig out on a long road trip. Beautiful... (p.s. pay no attention to the reviewer below; he has no idea what noise is.)"
2,Recording quality leaves much to be desired...,"I bought ""Of Color Bright"" because I had heard, and enjoyed, one of the songs from the album. The music on this album isn't bad; in fact it's rather nice, relaxing and flows well. Unfortunately, the recording quality of the lyrics is abysmal. It sounds as though the lead singer was recorded from three rooms away through a tin can. This results in the lyrics being slurred and almost indecipherable and ends up sounding like the lead singer has a speech impediment. If you can get over the quality of the recorded lyrics, you might find an enjoyable listen. For me though, it was a bit too aggravating to bother. In any case, make sure you check the preview clips before purchasing."
4,Worth Your Times,"It is worth buying this just to hear the recording of Another Reason I Don't Keep a Gun In The House. Billy Collins unique view of the world in both touching, and at times very funny."
3,Eh.,"I love Billy Collin's poetry for its charm, wit, and profound statements. He's a fine poet, but....on audio disc he is dull and anything but funny when hearing his voice."
2,Marta's Opinion,"The title enticed me to buy this book, but the actual scripts from various women didn't impart as much wisdom as I'd hoped. At times it was difficult to know why they bothered to tell their story... it obviously had meanings that were significant for the participant/writer but left the reader bored and wondering why it was shared."
1,Gigantic piece of crap,"I'm on my THIRD camera.The first one (bought from Best Buy) worked nicely for 4 months, then started alternately showing ""No Card"" and ""Card Error"" errors despite a variety of batteries and memory cards. Gateway took that one back, ruled it faulty, and sent me a new one.The second camera has lasted less than 2 weeks. It makes noices like it's going to take a picture but never takes a picture. Plus the camera dial is all screwed up. Half of the positions on the dial show something else. For example, the ""Movie"" dial position shows the setup screen instead.I've sent the second one back to Gateway, they've ruled it faulty, and are in the process of sending me a THIRD camera.Do not buy this camera! Spend the extra $50 and get something that isn't going to break all the time."
4,"Great Digital camera for its price & how to fix ""card error""","I got this camera for two weeks from gateway $199 after $50 rebate. very easy to use and had a lot of function. Order another 256MB SD and is on the way. The picture is very good outdoor with enought light, compare to my 1.5MP Sony DV, the picture is much more rich. The flash light need to be stronger. I had the ""card error"" today. The cause was I turn the dial between ""A"" and "">"" when I turn it on. Reset and nothing works, the memory card still works if I put in my memory card reader. I simply do a quick format under XP. Next I thing you is working again. What you pay is what you get but I think $200 is well spent. I would recommend if you just want something cheap for outdoor but would not recommend if you take lots of picture depends on flash ligh."
1,Camera repair is worthless,"purchased in Jan 04 the DC-T50. Needed repair for faulty shutdown and ""error"" message when taking pictures. Send in for repair on Feb 23rd for a ""10-day"" repair time. Have made ten requests for information about progress of repairs - with no represenative able to identify if, how, or when it will be repaired or replaced. Always telling me they will get me the information - but never do. To date, still only promises to my inquiry... nothing about a deadline as to when it will be returned. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL RESPONSE AND INFORMATION SERVICE."
4,No Problems At All In The Past Year,"I bought this camera about a year ago direct from Gateway. I have never once had any issue with the camera... No memory card error, no lens motor malfunction... and all of my pictures have turned out excellent."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This is an awful camera! I have had ALL the problems discussed in the below reviews - they didn't start immediately, but within a few months, I was experiencing them all! I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted $200. I consider the camera a throw-away! I would have rated this camera a ZERO if that was an option."
1,Horrible waste of money,"I am now on my third camera. Each one has had the same problem. I keep getting an error message stating ""Protected card"" (when the care is not protected). It is sporadic and makes the camera virtually unusuable. The message goes away after a while all by itself -- usually after the photo opportunity has passed.Gateway has no suggestions on what the problem is. Tech support just sends a new camera and it has the same problem.This is truly disgusting.I am now trying to get get my money back. I have wasted a bunch of money and lots of time. Also, I wanted the camera to use in my work and now I have to borrow someone else's camera to bring along as a backup in case this one decides not to work, which is often."
1,Lens motor locks up,"I ordered this camera 5 January 2004. I have returned three of them for lens lock-up hardware failure. Each return averaged 4 weeks to get a replacement. The 4th camera was received 10 May 2004. The lens locked up on 15 May 2004. I've put it in my drawer of despair. At $10.50 shipping costs for service, I can't justify spending any more for this obviously flawed camera."
4,Works great for me!,"Maybe I just got lucky, but this has been a terrific camera for me! I've had it since January 2005, and with 2 little ones around you can bet it's snapped it's share of photos. I did lose the pictures once (thankfully I'd already downloaded them) and realized that I was trying to switch modes while the camera was on. I stopped doing that and the problem never happened again. The memory format error finally happened a couple weeks ago, but really, most hard drives need to be reformatted after a couple years too! Most of the pictures have been great, though the auto flash red eye reduction isn't the best. This little camera has even withstood the occasional unauthorized use by my 4 yr old! It's not the biggest or the best, but for me it's been great!"
4,I love it!,"This is a fabulous camera. I've had it for about 9 months now, and it's served me well. The only downfall is how quick the battery dies, but that happens with many other digital cameras, as well. When purchased, I upgraded to a higher memory card. The included one is fine, but I take a lot of pictures, so for me, it was worth it. The camera is extremely sturdy. I've dropped it several times, and although it has a few scratches, it still works perfectly. It's light weight and small, without being lost. My only tip for users would be: when preparing to take a picture, hold the button half way down, so the camera can fully adjust, wait a second, and then take the picture. Sometimes you just press down and immediately take the picture, it focuses on the wrong area. But, overall, I really like this model."
1,Returning It,"Okay, so how can you go wrong with a 5MP camera? Answer: If it has a ""Gateway"" label! I just printed my first batch of photos at an automated Kodak digital printing service, and they were horrible! CNET reviews gives the Gateway 5MP image quality rating a 4 out of 10. I'd say more like a 2. Very dissappointed... and I am returning this camera ASAP, even though Gateway is charging me a hefty restocking fee - I will not waste another memory image with this piece of junk. Perhaps they could distribute them in a Happy Meal or cereal box as a kids toy."
4,A book you must have for C# professional programmer,"This is not an average Joe's book. I found the chapters that are useful for me like Chapter 13 (Files and Streams) for content management, Chapter 14 (ASP.NET Security Infrastructure), Chapter 15 (Forms Authentication) for internet web applications, and Chapter 16 (Windows Authentication) for intranet web applications. The main focus of this book are data access, application security, and advanced resource management which are important for enterprise web-based applications developers. I have reconfigured my web application server after I read this book to secured the loophole. The book covered some of the JavaScript but did not mention in great detail of Microsoft VBScript which I think the authors can expand a little more on VBScript part (For old classic ASP developers). This is a good book to put on your bookshelf for reference from time to time!"
2,Ex-ex Gay,"Read this several times over the course of a number of years. Andy is a good writer and if you adhere to his conservative religious beliefs about one being gay. Well your not gay you are broken and are attracted to the same sex. Then you may like this but if you are like me one adhered to the ex-gay belief/dogma for many many years but then came to his senses and realized that my attractions would never really change then stay far away from this book. For what you will hear is that you are broken, deceived, lied to by the liberal media, church, and the devil and God can not accept you as a gay human being."
2,uhg,it only heated up for a few seconds and that was the main reason i bought it and it makes my face oily :/
3,Warmth gone in a flash!,"I am 22 and I have some blackheads on my chin and around my nose and I thought (by the other reviews), that my blackheads would just roll out of my pores. I have been using this product for a week and nothing. Although it does make my face feel squeaky clean but sooner than later my face becomes dry if I do not put moisturizer shortly there after. Also I enjoy the heating effect, but it only lasts 1-2 seconds tops:( I think I need something that lasts much longer heating wise. Oh and I have hard water so it does clean off right away without that slime everyone is talking about;)"
5,Nice and Smooth,"Love this product. It makes my skin nice and smooth after using it without drying out my face. It only heats up a little so it is not irritating either, and I have very sensitive skin."
5,Fantastic!,"I wish I could buy boxes and boxes of this book. It's dated but still the best out there. How about reprinting it, guys?"
5,Definitely Move It!,"I found this book online. I couldn't get it in the bookstore but that's where it should be since it is an extremely useful book. Very easy to follow. I only wish the author and the publisher would update it. It's very, very useful and easy to use."
5,Splendid Step-by-Step Guide,"I've looked all over for simple to follow steps on how to relocate one's family and possessions. This book has it all, and I found it the most helpful of all books on moving. The only problem is that it's hard to get."
3,They were okay,"Make sure you like these before you order TWELVE boxes of them.My boys hate them, and if I make them it's just for me. Oops!!I ended up donating them to the local homeless shelter. Someone out there is enjoying some Potatoes!!"
4,Good Polity story and...,"Some other stuff I just couldn't get into.The first story is around 100 pages, the rest are shorts. I have enjoyed most of Asher's books set in the Polity universe (except Brass Man), and this story is pretty interesting. Despite being under 100 pages he introduces some cool tech, interesting characters and throws a few nice plot twists in.The other stuff fell flat for me after that. There's a paperback version available now for $10 and I would recommend that over the HC version."
3,Some problems with nagviation story ok. $9.99 at EBGames,"Anyway, I just wanted to shared that your local EBGames (or the online website) has the same game brand new at $9.99.I got bored after a few hours of playing this game. There aren't too many places to see. You're stuck at the same place most of the time and you have to visit the same places time after time because most items are event activated meaning that they only get activated after some events occur.There were some bugs with the animation engine. Sometimes there's no indication for the hotspots so you'll be stuck at some point wondering what to do next. And some of the puzzles can be challenging.I got through with the help of a walkthrough."
4,So sue me,"Maybe I have a higher level of frustration tolerance than some of the other players. There were a few glitches, and one spot where a got stuck a couple (ok, 3 or 4) times, but I found the game a lot of fun. The scenery was lovely, the characters engaging enough for the role they played, and since I finished it, obviously none of the glitches were fatal. I believe I'd like to visit there in the future. I played on XP, and I did save often, that may have helped."
4,i liked it,"I bought this game on a whim and installed it on my pc. started playing it and immediately had to use an online walkthrough becuase the thing i was hunting for was not recognizeable. i was angry, but after i found it i moved on and the game opened up to a very immersed world that held my interest throught the entire game. i did have to keep referencing the walkthrough for some puzzles were just difficult. the game crashed once or twice, you know, the usual. i payed under $10 for this game, and considering the wonderful atmosphere and interesting worlds i got to explore, it was well worth it. It's almost sort of ""Syberia"" like with it's unique scapes. I guess it all depends on what you're looking for. It definitely doesn't deserve all these bad reviews. Oh it has some awesome puzzles, it was not a short game, doesn't tease you and leave you wanting, i'd play it again for sure."
1,Avoid this game,"What a stinker! It's been a while since I played a game this bad! Sure, the scenery graphics look great, but don't be fooled...just wait until you have to navigate the screens - You will think you are a beta-tester at a video game company...in the EARLY stages of development.Most games have at least one saving grace that makes me glad I experienced them, but not this one. ugh! I may have to just chuck it out with the garbage!"
1,"Unfinished, Unprofessional, Unplayable","This is junk. The ""designers"" have incorporated some of the worst game design mistakes in the past ten years, all in a single package. Poor voice acting, terrible pathfinding, dull art and little music or ambient noise. Worst of all, utterly broken puzzles, with no clues, no feedback, just random clicking on pylons or items scattered randomly over the landscape. This is a disaster -- did these people not do ANY playtesting??? Have they never played a game before themselves???"
1,Do Not buy unless you love torture!,"I recently purchased Journey to the center of the earth. It is an inventory based game that I bought because of the promised beautiful graphics. This is a beautiful looking game that is extremely hard because it is extremely linear; if you forget to look at something or if you didn't do something in the exact order, you will not find your way to other screens. This game will be great for people who love inventory, who love to click on every single inch of the screen to find something, or find a way out of the screen. I feel the game play is outdated and the acting is babyish and the story and persons in it, illogical. The story would have made a lot of sense if she was in a coma or dreaming. I needed a walk through and the directions on the walk through were still wrong. If you like to pull your hair out and get a headache, get this game. I gave up half way because I was not enjoying the beautiful graphics. This was not fun at all."
3,Pretty dull,"Despite having a nice variety of locations and artistic style( a value I probally place too much emphasis on in video games), this game falls flat and becomes another sad excersice in computer adventure gaming..Only get if you are a true fan of the genre and have nothing to play"
1,Worst zeppelin film ever,"THis so could movie was outragoisly boring....They talked about''Jeff Beck more than they do Robert Plant and all it is old english guys talkiin about crap, Sure it gives the story of zeppelin but there is no music by zeppelin , no live fotage but just pictures. I really did not like this film at all."
1,No Zepplin Music,"I expected something like those VH1 behind the scenes kind of rockumentary but was sadly disappointed. There was no Zeppelin music during the film. No live footage and no interviews with any of the band members for this film. The only footage from band members were from old news or other sources from 30 years ago. Although this should be included, they apparently had no cooperation from Paige or Plant for this film. If the artist decided not to support it, it may be for a good reason. There must be something better out there, avoid this film!"
3,A to Zeppelin-The Unauthorized Story of Led Zeppelin.,"Decent if not mediocre documentary on a Great band,Most Zeppelin fans would probably be disappointed,documentary needed more to make it worthy,3 stars for the effort on a great band,but it's nothing to sneeze at."
3,A cut and paste,"There's no actual Led Zeppelin music, and none of the band members were actually interviewed for this exploitation docu. Only clips from other sources were put together from the band itself. Interviews with others such as Jimmy Page's 14 year old girlfriend from the 70s, Richard Cole, their roadie, and Carmine Appice, the drummer who was briefly considered to replace John Bonham, may have been done for this film, but I'm not sure. There is no audio of John Bonham or John Paul Jones talking, and only some barely decipherable audio from Jimmy Page makes it in here. This puts the story together, but I would imagine there is better out there."
1,Unsealed and only half full!,Didn't realize we were ordering a used product. And it's hard to believe that I would be sent a half full/empty bottle! Dissapointed is putting it lightly.
1,Don't waste a dime on this!,"Don't waste a dime on this!The content is advertised as "" A course on listening to lectures and note-taking""This is NOT what is on the CDs.Imagine if you will, an 8th grade class of children are given an assignment to write a short essay on some miscellaneous topic.One of the boys writes an essay titled ""My thoughts on what telecommuting is like for my big brother""One of the little girls writes an essay titled ""The colleges my mommy went to, her degrees and one or two experiences she had bumping into hubris.""These kids then took their essays home and had their mommies and daddies record them on tape.I'm not kidding!!!The two CDs in this package could actually be just that!There is ABSOLUTELY no structured flow and absolutely no instruction on the topic of listening to lectures or note-taking.It is basically a half dozen anecdotal chitty-chats.THANK YOU AMAZON!..... for letting me return this."
4,"Same old song, different set of stiletto heels","In a pre-Donnas world, garage-gal retro-rock would reference '60s groups such as the Standells and Troggs, along with a liberal dose of roughened-up girl-group riffs... Nowadays, though, the touchpoints are more likely to be '70s-style hard rock and power-pop backbeats -- Cheap Trick, Montrose, maybe even a little Foghat or Sweet. And of course, we can't forget foremothers such as the Schoolgirls, Runaways and Suzi Quatro. These gals cover a lot of familiar territory, with plenty of jailbait-y pouting and lyrical snarls, but they do hit some solid grooves, and do dip back into the fuzz-drenched 'Sixties grab-bag for a tune or two. They're not saying anything new, but sweaty-fisted fans of the style will probably dig it... especially if they crank it up loud. (DJ Joe Sixpack)"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!,I bought this thinking it was going to be like the one Bulldog sells. It is not! This thing was wired all wrong. As soon a I turned the key the starter engaged without turning the key to the start position. It took me over an hour to figure out what was wrong and rewire it. Not a time saver. Buy the genuine Bulldog T harness instead. I wish there was a rating lower than one star! This item is garbage.
2,Poor packaging,Due to poor packaging my clorox cleaner showed up a mess. One bottle completely emptied and another one the nozzle broke. The box it came in was one big mushy mess when it arrived due to the one that leaked out completely.
2,Heavy bleach smell,"I bought this product to clean some hard to remove dirt stains in my bathroom shower and to remove the mildew on some of the grouting. It worked on the mildew but didn't clean the dirt on the shower floor tiles, even with heavy scrubbing. The bleach smell was overwhelming, even with the windows open and a fan going.I decided to try it on some outdoor furniture that was dirty. It didn't really do much except for killing some mossy growth in the corner of one of the chairs. It didn't make much of a difference on the dirt, even with scrubbing. I sprayed the product on the chairs and let them sit for 10 or 15 minutes and tried again. Still didn't touch it.So then I mixed up someChurch & Dwight Co 51516 Oxi Clean Versatile Stain Removeraccording to directions, and applied it with a rag and let that sit for 10 minutes on both the outdoor furniture and shower floor. It did a much better job of removing the dirt from both the lawn chairs and the shower."
5,review of review,I read a review that said this is a pretty good book. So I guess that means it is pretty good.
5,Our FAVORITE workout video!,"This is a wonderful ballet workout. It feels just like a ballet class! It has five segments that you can do separately , all together , or mix and match. Jennifer's pleasant and encouraging voice keeps the video lighthearted even during the harder exercises.There are modifications for almost every exercise , both to make them easier and harder , so they would work for a wider range of fitness. The exercises are graceful and beautiful as well as physically and mentally challenging. You can feel your posture and strength improving after just a few times. My daughters and I keep going back to this one --- It was definitely worth purchasing!!!!!!"
5,I love this DVD!,"I really like how the exercises are grouped in separate sections. At first I was concerned that I would not get an effective workout, but fortunately, I was wrong. The variety of the movements makes the exercises fun and motivating."
5,One of the best,"Love this workout. It's fun, challenging and creative. If you are looking for a ballet inspired workout, this is it. I also enjoy the yoga inspired cool down. Jennifer Galardi did an excellent job with this one."
3,Ballet Body,"This is a good video. To be honest, I haven't used it that much, because I was looking for a different type of workout. She does a good job of going through the motions, and for the most part, for those out there who need a good basis to start from, this would be it. I only gave it three stars because I was looking for something different than this when I purchased."
5,amazing workout!,"love, love, love this dvd! as other reviewers have stated, it really makes you feel wonderful during and, more importantly, after: taller, leaner, stronger, more balanced . . . an essential complement to your workout repertoire. i find alternating it with days of resistance training and treadmills workouts yields unparalleled results. and, as always, jen galardi is motivating, inspirational, and extremely competent. this dvd is a winner all-around!"
5,Love this workout!,"I bought this DVD because after I discovered Jennifer Galardi, I was hooked. She has a great way of explaining even complex moves, so you not only understand proper form, but also the benefits for your body. This workout is challenging enough that I know I won't get sick of it, but not so hard that I'm too sore to move afterward.Fantastic for flexibility and balance, not to mention posture! I've just recently started this workout, but I'm sure in a short while I'll be able to rave about how well it tones the body too!"
3,Works OK but Not Quickly,"My first pancake swelled up and looked misshapened. Once I started making thinner pancakes, it worked better but it still adds considerable time to breakfast making. I suggest the Chef's Choice heart-shaped waffle maker and/or the Norpro silicon hearts instead."
3,cassettes available from Khmer School of Language,A set of five cassettes for this book is available from the Khmer School of Language. E-mail : ksl@forum.org.kh URL : http://www.cambcomm.org.uk/ksl/
3,Phonetics little bit inaccurate.,"The book is very good and comprehensive for people who want to learn the language, but the phonetics in the book is a little bit inaccurate. It is recommended that you use this book with Huffman's audio cassette on Khmer or if you know someone who can speak khmer ask that person to pronounce for you."
1,I am still mad,ordered months ago. contacted them at least 4 times . never responded. never got product. grrrrr.
2,Not sure it's worth the money.,"This book is a reprint of a 1946 publication. It has chapters on materials, procedures, methods of other artists, ways of using gouache, and ""general."" It's about half illustrations, but, alas, they're all in black and white, even though in the original version some were apparently in color. It defines gouache ""as a type of painting rather than strictly a type of paint,"" since it was apparently written before commercial gouaches were available. Then--the author says he recommends Shiva Caseins! Which are similar but not quite the same as the opaque watercolors that W&N and others now make. Still, it's not entirely without good ideas. It has a handful of exercises and some advice by other artists (again, sometimes casein)."
2,Drunken Mouse Master,"Do be advised that the main character of this book is a drunk. That wasn't in the product description I read. That's my main complaint, I wouldn't show this book to a child personally."
5,Ice pack for neck,The product is perfect for the neck and shoulder application. I have herniated discs and arthritis. this relieves the tension build up which creates the strain on my neck. Excelllent product!
2,Not as pictured,"The Utili-key 6 in one tool is pictured, not the actual product which is tht 6 in 1 multi tool with key ring. I thought I was ordering the former, and when I tried to return it, it was nearly impossible. Amazon referred me to the seller who specified that this product was fufilled by Amazon. For $8 it wasn't worth any further hassle. The tool I received is OK. I don't know about 6 functions, but the pliers plus a phillips and flat head screwdriver will be useful."
2,Go for the Micro-Max instead if you really want this,"Swiss Tech really messed up on the Micro/Micro-Max series. The Micro original is super small and pocket sized, however the screw driver features are clumsy and fat, making them limited to very few screws, and not even that great at unscrewing/screwing (good luck getting a solid lock!). The plier function is also poor- the teeth are glossed over, making the 'bite' poor and slippery- this is not helped by the device being so small that you can't get enough leverage to do whatever you wanted to do.The Micro-Max for a few dollars more doesn't address any of the issues above, however it at least comes with a few more features that aren't half bad, and it isn't much larger as well.Swiss Tech has some really innovative designs, but the way they execute them is quite disappointing. I donated my Micro as soon as I found it again while going through my old belongings. Glad it's gone."
4,"solid product, but very small..","the bite on the pliers is able to bite about half of a penny, so it isnt very big.. the arms feel sturdy under pressure though. youre more or less buying this for a couple main jobs:screwdrivingusing the pliers to pull out burnt car fuseswire cutting/strippingits more or less a novelty, but if you work on your car a a lot this would be handy to have, which is why i got it..i believe i will enjoy it and it was a good buy for the money"
4,Nice Tool,"This is a nice cd to help augment the korean language taught at the Dojan.I play it on my drive to work and home, this way it keeps the term fresh in my mind."
2,A Spy's Journey,"I thought that the book was poorly written because the writer puts none of his stories in any context of what was going on at the time that the events he writes about were occuring. He could have added a lot about what happened after Carter and Turner with the help of the Church committee wrecked the CIA. A couple of his ""hah hah"" stories should have gotten somone fired for bad judgement.A shallow book over all. There are a lot better books written by CIA alums."
1,Too Shallow,"I am student of CIA. Have read many biographys and auto-biographys of former employees of the ""company"". This book is very difficult to read. Much too shallow. More detail about countries, dates and timelines is necessary. I realize that there are restrictions to the information that can be divulged and that CIA does edit these non-fiction accounts and histories, but this is unnecessarily lite. I tried reading it twice but couldn't go on with it. In addition, Mr. Paseman's attitude and self-rightousness is also difficult to bear."
3,A Spy's Journey,a pedestrian book - the censorship ruins it which is a pity. He writes about events in the past so it would be quite acceptable to name countries - it was obvious when he was refering to the Philipines
3,Covert Career,"This book gives what seems to be a straightforward account of one man's career in the CIA. Maybe because of lingering security restrictions, the text focuses on bureaucratic infighting and personal episodes. The former often seem petty (as committed by fellow agents or higher-ups) and the later sometimes sophomoric (as committed or retold by Mr. Paseman.)Solid ideas about improving the intelligence gathering work of the CIA are presented in this memoir."
3,Not enough depth,"Interesting but with really no depth.It's really a series of short stories and little detail.If you are looking for a book that explains how spies work, there are better books."
3,A Spy's Journal,"Like other reviewers, I found this book interesting but it left much to be desired. Paseman's sense of humor didn't match mine in too many places, and because of security or sensitivity he couldn't go into detail about a number of cases or interviews, which tended to lose me as he went along. Whenever he cited another CIA book, I was tempted to drop Paseman and go check out his recommendations, but I stayed along till the end. He finishes the book with a veteran's laundry list of what is going right and what needs to be corrected in the CIA. Of some interest the first time around, this will probably not cause you to pick it up a second time."
3,"Poorly written, but entertaining.","While certainly a skilled case officer, Mr. Paseman's writing skills leave something to be desired. His memoirs are very entertaining and full of unique experiences, but his lack of skill with the written word means that paragraphs are clunky and flow poorly. Well worth the money for anyone looking to find out exactly what being a CIA case officer is truly like, but don't expect writing skills beyond the level of a high school newspaper editor."
4,As good as it gets,"Considering that the CIA will review and edit to make sure that no specific details of importance are divulged, Mr. Paseman's account of his career as a spy over various decades is an interesting read. No, it's not a Ludlum spy novel, but his career spanned many presidencies and world events. his insight and opinions are very relevant to today's world and the timing of career serves as a backdrop to the horrific events on 9/11. If you are interested in American Intelligence, pick up this book."
1,"Batter fine, tool itself, not so much","The battery pack was OK. The Dremel tool itself is a bust. Did not work with the new batter pack either and have since found out from other users of the Dremel tool, that it doesn't last very long at all."
3,??,"well, We really thought these batteries life would last longer... we bought to take to timber to sharpen chainsaw chains... you were lucky if you could get through 1-1/2 chains we probably used the two batteries we bought maybe, a dozen times and then no longer held charge....."
4,I have 4 batteries now,I have to rotate charging batteries for my 7.2 volt dremel because after a while they don't hold a charge for trimming more than 1 rottweilers toenails. At first the charge holds for a few days. Later after multiple uses the battery doesn't hold long enough to trim more than one rottie at a time. Since I have 5 rotties I like to trim all toenails at about the same time every month so I have 4 batteries and 2 chargers and charge up 2 at a time. The fact that this dremel is cordless is perfect because rottweilers often move around and don't really care for their manicures so being cordless allows me to be a contortionist when wrestling with their tough toenails.
4,Dremel Battery 7.2 volt,"Not much to say, item can in on time and appears to work just fine. Can't ask for much more. Dremel unit is used to trim dogs nails, crazy Greyhound seems to enjoy it!"
2,Dremel battery does not hold charge,"when recharged after only one charge, does not hold charge.can not recommend this as a replacment for new battery."
1,Lame battery pack,Doesn't hold a charge. Gave up on the rechargable dremel type grinder. Replaced it with a corded Dremel unit. Don't waste your money
2,good but...,"bought this 9 months ago.... it works fine and has the expected life.... but the fit inside the tool was not exact and it was very difficult to latch into place.... i used a very fine, flat file to deepen the step in the retainer clips slightly and got it to fit... but went very very slightly too far and the battery is now slightly loose...enough to make some pretty loud vibration noiseannoying to pay premium for this type of tool and then it become a pain to get a battery for.... the original battery was so good.. lasted over 3 years... so there is almost a argument to just buy a new tool.... but seems unfair to the customerI almost got the feeling whomever was the OEM on these replacements isn't up to snuff or maybe even this isn't a genuine Dremel battery... it's got the Dremel label... but just doesn't seem right... the original one fit perfectly...."
4,Good Value,I needed this to replace the stock battery. Holds a charge well and worth the money. Couldn't find anything bad to say about it. Recommended.
4,Dremel multipro battery,This was a replacement battery the original went bad because we kept it plugged in all the time (my bad). This battery has lasted longer that the firs because I'm using it properly now.
4,New battery,We use our Dremel a ton and had found the original battery was not holding a charge. We bought it about 2 years ago. My husband uses it for his hobby and I use it for trimming dog nails and I have four dogs. We were disappointed that the original one did not last longer but hopefully this one will last even longer.
5,Dremel Battery,"The new battery fit properly and works well. It's not the same color as my old Dremel tool, but thats okay with me. Mike - Texas"
3,battery problem,"The battery I received for my Dremel multipro looks just like the original. But, when I try to insert it in the charger or tool it doesn't fit snuggly like the original and takes some effort to get it to take a charge or power the tool.I was able to get it to fit in the charge by using a large spring clamp to hold the two together and then when it was charged I had to hold it tightly in the palm of my hand to operate the tool.It does hold a good charge but for some reason the configuration of the tabs to hold it in place isn't exactly the same as the original.I guess that's the price I must pay for the cheapest battery I could find."
5,My dremel,Works great. Combinieny to have more than one battery. I recommend this line of products. It was very easy to buy on line using amazon.com.
3,"Funny Book for Cat-Owners and -Lovers, But a Bit Repetative","The title of this review pretty much says it all. This is a very short (only about 71 half-sized but fully-illustrated pages), cute little book for people who love (or simply own) a cat or cats. It's funny, if a little silly at times and has a few jokes that are repeated (albeit in slightly different ways) almost to the point of being beaten into the ground. Still, it's amusing and definitely a nice small gift for someone who likes and/or owns a cat."
4,Frustrated,I just bought a carpet touch-up roller at Albertsons. It is great especially for picking up cat litter on my floors. The problem is I cannot find any roller re-fills.
4,My first Pedro experience...won't be the last,"I listened to the Whole EP a couple of days after my birthday just gone recently. I was pretty depressed and almost suicidal to some point.The first track I listen to was the titled track - WHOLE.What can I say about this particular song which has not already been said before countless times?My first instinct was to write the band off as a Lou Barlow/Sebadoh clone - but careful listening, and the state of mind that I was in at the time quickly put me right.This was a lot softer and more depressing than any Lou Barlow or Sebadoh track has ever been.I don't care much for the rest of the Ep, but the title track is worth at least $20 on it's own!Go out and buy this - put it on your christmas wish list, and pray to someone that you recieve it."
3,Light and full of useful information!,"This thin publication in a protective plastic sleeve will slip easily into a breast pocket or purse, taking up little room and not weighing you down. For it's size it has much useful information for a short stay in Venice. Maps lack street names. So if you are one who likes to explore off the sugested tours you may want to pack an additonal map for security. Useful brief bits of information regarding culture, history,weather, Holidays, ""Do's and Don'ts"" and more will help the first time traveler. If you don't want to carry the a heavier more detailed tour book on long walks (which you should pack)this little guide will certainly get you by for a few days."
1,What a waste!,"This is more of a pamphlet, and offers useless tipslike:Restaurants: YesHotels: Reserve in advanceGive me abreak!... END"
2,filter basket sticks to rubber gasket,"I would like to give this a better review. It does make good coffee. However, I can only award 2 stars to this coffee maker because every time I take it apart to rinse out and clean, the top of the filter basket has stuck to the rubber basket. I can only get it off with great difficulty, pulling out the rubber gasket, which is very difficult to put back in position. You can do better."
2,Speak German?,"In the description of this DVD, it says that the language is English and subtitles are in German. I thought I would be able to turn off the subtitles or that they would be printed at the bottom of the screen, when in fact, the Def Leppard members are speaking in English and a reporter translates in German over them, so that all one can hear is the German language--the band members voices are ""drowned out."" The DVD begins with an event honoring the group, then goes to a studio where one sees them interviewed. That's really all there is to the DVD. If you want to complete your Def Leppard collection, then get it, but if you want to understand the comments of the band members, then you may want to reconsider. Maybe this will prompt me to study German. LOL"
3,Poison - Rock Power,"""Poison Rock Power"" DVD is a documentary with Poison interviews and music videos.This DVD is a re-release of ""Poison - Nothin But a Good Time Unathorized"" (2003) also known as ""Poison - Rock Legends"" (the import version) which was already re-released in 2006 as ""Poison - Stand on the Road"" and now yet again the same DVD is re-released with a new cover and title ""Poison Rock Power"". Not sure why they keep re-releasing this DVD because there are only 2 interviews which are not even that good ? Maybe it's because this DVD is a third party release and is not coming from the band and whoever is releasing it, is doing so because it's their only claim to fame. Still gave it 3 stars, only because it's POISON."
2,what is that german?,Got this as a gift form a non music friend. I was excited until I played it to find it in a totally different language. Very sad I gave it to my friend that was client German and he loves it. Sucks for me though.
2,Probably a good book for women being abused,"The book was easy to order, it arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition. My only problem was that it was supposed to discuss men being abused by their wifes. But it did not cover that type of spousel abuse as it was advertised to discuss."
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this and a few other books on CD for my husband who has a bit of dislexia (sp?) and has trouble reading. He was so engrossed in the stories that if he were near the end of one, he would sit in the driveway and listen until it was done. So then, by proxy, I know all of the stories and it seems like a wonderful 'read'. This is a perfect gift for someone who enjoys fine adventure literature by fine authors."
1,Disappointed,"Quite disappointed in the selection of ""classic"" short stories selected. Should have titles spelled out and samples if possible."
2,"American stories, yes, but definitely not great","Admittedly the short story is not my favorite literature form; nevertheless, I was expecting something interesting from such big names as Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Ambrose Bierce and Jack London. Instead, these stories were all disappointing.The four by Twain and the two by Crane were interesting, but the endings were so anti-climactic that I was left wondering, ""is that it?!"" In particular The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County left me scratching my head at how such a pointless story became so famous. The two stories by Bierce were difficult for me to follow, and at the end I really didn't even know what they were about. The two stories by London were, not surprisingly, about men alone in the frozen northern wilderness. One barely makes it out alive and one freezes to death; not exactly my choice of entertaining and captivating reading.In spite of the big name authors, these stories are insipid yawners."
3,Errors,"The story selections were very good, but my complaint is the CD's were mislabeled and CD #1 was also same as CD#5.This had great potential but fell far short of expectations."
4,Nice mix of classics from high school and college reading lists,I really enhoyed listening to stories that I read in high school and freshman college English LIteratiyreThere is a reason they are called classics because they are that good
4,Great American Stories,Was purchased as a gift. Found to be defective and was returned and received very prompt replacement. Giftee seemed quite pleased.
2,"Negative, negative, negative","I bought this selection because of the title, which credits the stories to Mark Twain. I would have loved ten of his stories! Unfortunately, the selections for inclusion (other than Mr. Twain's) were some of the poorest examples of American literature that I have read. They weren't even good irony; they were just depressing. I'm sure there could be a great collection of American short stories; these were certainly not that."
2,"""We will, we will, bore you!""","""Becoming Queen"" is a disappointing documentary about the flamboyant rock opera band QUEEN. It literally put me to sleep, like anaesthesia. The beginning is interesting--discussing the early bands Smile and Ibex that eventually became QUEEN thanks to the force of Nature Freddie Mercury. Ironically, Freddie Mercury's bio is cursory, despite him being the front man. There's more emphasis on Roger Taylor and Brian May. Freddie Mercury becomes a cameo in his life story. The beginning is gradual, but by the time it gets to QUEEN--it moves way to fast. Suddenly, QUEEN is doing music forIron Eagle--butFlash Gordon (Saviour Of The Universe Edition)is omitted. It goes so fast that it seems their career last 5 minutes before Mercury passes away from AIDS.""Becoming Queen"" could've been as flamboyant and fun as QUEEN's rock operatic music... instead it's a sleeper. It's a good cure for insomnia. We will, we will, bore you."
1,Worst queen documentary ever,"I cannot understand why some of the other reviewers gave more than 1 star to that crappy documentary. There is No queen music at all, and it's soooo soooo kitschy. A non-queen fan would start to laugh by watching freddie moving all the time like 'the number one fag' in the interface menus. It's not a representation of queen at all. Very poor and disapointing. Worst queen documentary ever. Don't buy it"
5,Awesome!!!!,"I can't believe only one person has reviewed this CD!!! Crux is so stinkin cool. Punk music has spawned some awesome groups, and Crux is one of the best.1 Paint 5/52 In Short 5/53 Punk Police 5/54 Relentless 5/55 Blue Collared Guy 4/56 Farming In Beijing 4/57 Not Taken 4/58 Bring On Some Anarchy 5/59 Not See 5/510 Kant U C 5/511 Move 5/512 What Caliber Of Man 5/513 Stupid 5/514 Swallowed Up With Life 5/515 Appetite 5/516 Cakewalk 4/5So why are you sitting there reading this lame review, get off your but and buy this NOW!!!!"
4,Lots of bass guitars,I liked this CD because all the songs were fast paced and the way the lyrics were sung was dope....
5,One of the best memoirs I've read,"""News Junkie"" isn't just a memoir about addiction, though it captures that experience masterfully and compassionately. It examines, through the author's harrowing personal story, the line between passion and obsession, drive and compulsion. Any reader who has ever become attached to something to the point of obsession (that is, probably, every reader) will identify, regardless of whether they know what cocaine feels like. ""News Junkie"" is also a book about secrets, and Jason Leopold delivers those secrets--even his most carefully guarded ones--with astonishingly candid grace.This book is a page-turner in the most accomplished sense. There are no cheap tricks or manufactured plot twists here; the suspense is generated by Leopold's empathy and honesty, his ability to bring readers straight into the heart of his story. This is a magnificent book."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I was unable to go to sleep once I opened this book. The story is fascinating from all angles -- drug addiction and recovery, news reporting, the current state of the news. And, despite his demons, the protagonist is so smart and likeable that you find yourself rooting for him even when he behaves badly. I did not want the book to end. I highly recommend it."
4,An Interesting Journey of Drug Lows and Jouranlism Highs,"Simple, it was a really good read. From stat to finish it was gripping. Leopold puts you in his shoes as he lies, does drugs, and reports on some huge stories.We also get to see him survive due to his family, his sucess as an investigative reporter and his kicking his drug habbit.From taking coke in the LA courthouse bathroom to his interview with Jeff Skilling, Leopold takes us on that roller coaster ride with him."
5,hollywood legend,"a must see. William Buzick is a legendary filmmaker now in heaven. he was a millionaire genius with a gift for the mysterious. his next film was to be shot in rio with m. madsen and dennis hopper, but is on hold. this film was shot on skyline drive in the hollywood hills and Hawaii. It is perhaps the most intriguing and subtle cinematic noire film ever completed. It highlights the acting skills of Dino Desby with his line about pink peruvian crack rock that is one of the funniest lines ever uttered by a john candy-like actor. The cloud sequence in Hawaii is stunning with heli-shots from above. the vietnam scenes are reminiscent of Platoon and the Deer Hunter. This movie will one day be compare to orson welles' citizen kane."
5,"Unique, creative, exciting, and absorbing!","I wish this book was still in print -- I'd love to buy many copies for friends. I found it very unique among any other children's books I've read because of how it is read and its very fun and unsual ending! My 2-year old absolutely loves it, as does my 6-year old nephew (so the book can appeal to quite an age range). The tension builds as you read through the book in a whisper... Trying to make your way through the giant's castle without waking him! The tension builds to an exciting finish that suddenly brings you back to reality and breaks the tension in a delightful way! I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
3,Potporri of Grimes stories,"This is the smallest of the first 4 Grimes SFBC Anthologies, containing 3 stories, and a collection of 6 short stories (totalling a little over 500 pages):*** The Last Amazon - Too many coincidences and re-used plots/characters from previous Grime's adventures.**** The Wild Ones - Chandler's last novel, not bad, the ""Seiko"" robot character was interesting (although a ""Honda"" or ""Sony"" prediction would have been more on target).**** Short story collection - Nice collection, Chandler is at his best with short stories* Catch the Star Winds - Dull read, I don't really consider this a Grimes novel, this is by far the worst story in all of the SFBC Grimes Collections... let's hope future anthologies leave out crud like this."
1,Not so very complicated,"Everything that needs to be understood about the issues involved were summed up in the actions of the Chief Rabbi of Rome in the aftermath of the war. I found no discussion of same here. Perhaps recent generations don't understand that Italy was allied to Germany; the Vatican contribution, given this, was astonishing in its quiet - but determined - humanitarian integrity. The Nazis, too, had a church. The church in Germany had windows under which Ms Zucotti might more profitably gaze."
1,Drivel,"Replete with unsupported speculation and bizarre hypotheses Zuccotti's book may be the worst and least helpful I've ever read on the subject. She clearly sets out to debunk Vatican claims of assistance to Jewish refugees but employs fuzzy, results oriented ""thinking"" to do so. A typical instance involves her acknowledgment that the Vatican supplied foodstuffs to a convent which sheltered Jews but she observes that there is ""no way to know how much food was delivered"" and ""that any supplies were intended specifically for Jews"". This type of dopey observation is found throughout the book. This is not a scholarly, well reasoned investigation of the issue but rather a collection of Zuccotti's oddball musings. One would benefit by reading just about any other treatment of the subject."
3,Excellent guide to nudist clubs in the U.S & Canada,"Although this book contains detailed information on most of the American Association for Nude Recreation's for-profit clubs around the U.S. and Canada, it falls short in recognizing the variety of skinny-dipping and other nude recreation spots which are better covered in Lee Baxandall's World Guide. Both books are required reading to cover the gamut of nude recreation opportunities."
3,Interesting,"Dr. Mitchell, astronaut and founder of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, discusses his mystical experience in space and tells about the ESP experiments that he performed while in transit to the moon as well as his theories about the nature of human consciousness. He tells of how he became convinced of the realities of paranormal events and tries to explain these events by rejecting the sacred cow of epiphenomenalism by intuiting that human consciousness is an integral part of the structure of the universe. Not always completley convincing, but always intensely interesting. This is an example of a man who refuses to be hemmed in by traditional ideas of what science should be."
5,THE WAY OF THE EXPLORER,WOW.....this book gives you a whole different perspective of space and life here on earth. It was hard to put down. Goes into some heavy scientific details that can go over your head. A must read.
4,Journey of the Explorer,This book was just what I was looking for in my research as an artist. I wanted to read about the perspective/realtionship of science/spirituallity and how the information might relate to metaphorical imagery in my paintings. Mitchell gets a little too wordy with scientific jargon at times but he warns the reader early on that you are welcome to skip certain chapters if you wish? I would recommend this book for anyone that is looking for an indepth and personal perspective of technology and its actual relationship to the organic from zero field to the outer reaches of our universe.
4,Still reading so far it is very good.,"Although this book is not exactly what I thought, I am learning a lot and it is well-written. I am still reading and not finished yet, however, I would give it 4 stars. I was under the impression that Dr. Mitchell had experienced extraterrestials while exploring the Universe, and was speaking about his experience; however, it is not at all about that, but more scientific, explaining the relationship between matter and energy and how it operates in our Universe. A lot of it is quite over my head; however, I am learning and understanding what he is saying, which surprises me. This proves his writing is superb, if I can understand the subject matter.The Way of the Explorer, Revised Edition"
5,Helpful for the spritual reader,"It helps me to find a translation of certain spritual sanskrit terms. If different schools hold a differnt meaning for the term, the meanings are listed separately for each school. It has to be said that if one would want to find really everything, one would have to buy Monier Williams super large sanskrit english dictionary. However, for a spiritual reader like myself, Grimes book is just great."
4,The Historical Jesus,"Much better then most written Books on Yeshusa ben Yosef aka Jesus the Christ. most of what we read about jesus today is a mixture of Stories about others , most information if not all were burnt by the early church of Rome . so that they could create their own version you have to remember the Roman Catholic Church Wanted to Rid the Jewish created Religion by Jesus the Jew its very hard to do any research on any real Historical person with the title of Christ . one more note ----- Always Remember History is written by the Victors not by the losers. By the Book its a good read.R.P.C."
2,No good..,"These are too narrow for a slipper and also too stiff. Slippers should be soft and roomy, these are neither...going back. They don't seem like they would be warm either."
4,The Boys,"Power pop punk...I know they hate being categorized like punk rock...but they are! maybe these kids are not in the level of the Clash, but have memorable tracks. this is the second band release and I think the're very influenced by The Beatles, you can feel it, even they had a cover of Paul Mc Cartey on the first selftitled album.there is a bonus track of The Yobs, a christmas cover ""Silent Night""cool band. give them a try."
2,""".....you're going to need a different book!!","I've just finished using this book and, while I normally keep my textbooks as reference materials, I found this book to be so bad that I'm selling it back! This book falls short when it comes to providing solid examples; clear, concise text; and valid exercises. Specifically, the pages are so crammed full of text and colors that it is often difficult to quickly find specific information. Much of the text and many of the examples fail to adequately prepare the student for the exercise sets. Additionally, the accompanying solution manual, which helped me immensely, has numerous typos and is missing several pages of solutions. I wish I were alone in my opinion, but the overwhelming majority of my class felt about the same. Even our professor was less than impressed. If this is the textbook you must have for class, get some additional references, i.e. Schaums, or something similar, perhaps even another 5 star rated book from Amazon."
5,College Albegra Student Study Guide,This book is a must have for all students. It shows you step by step how to do the odd problems in each chapter. I highly recommend it!
4,College Algebra by Aufmann,"This book is written for the average college student. Thematerial is illustrated well and there are many examplesdepicting the mathematical concepts. More advanced studentsare sufficiently challenged, average students will work hardand below-average students may have problems. It is importantfor the instructor to assign frequent homeworks and reviewthe homeworks before continuing with new material. A smallminority of students enter college having had NO ALGEBRA inhigh school. I wish that some of these students would returnto high school to complete the work they never finished.Overall, I'm satisfied that the text represents a fairconcensus of the problems encountered in College Algebra.There are sufficient word problems which require studentsto translate verbiage into mathematical formulas. In addition,classic areas; such as, ""complete the square"" are coveredthoroughly."
3,misnomer,"This is a decent companion to Chekhov's plays, but there is hardly a mention of his short stories. Chekhov's writing marks the start of the modern short story format and hugely influenced the modernist period and just about every short fiction writer since. The Cambridge Companion to Chekhov doesn't devote a single chapter to his short fiction: It really ought to be named The companion to Checkov's drama."
3,good enough for $12,"this book doesn't explain design processes. it has couple essays written by eisenman and other critics.if you want to know more about eisenman and his design process, i wouldn't recommend this book.however, this book can be a good supplementary book. this book has plans & sections.i read other books to learn about eisenman's design process. and i thought it would be good to have books that include plans & sections that i would have hard time finding, unless i scan books from library.with shipping, this book costs less than $12."
1,Disposable,"Strictly for the pretentious student, 'Blurred Zones'is a veritable catalog of every half-baked, poorly considered jargonisticly-driven notion that made so much of 1990's architecture the wrong-headed foolishness it was. Eisenman's uber-contrived text attempts to blur only the paucity of sophisticated architectural concepts in this disposable volume. Instead, he serves up the sort of slick, but empty computer graphics that belong in comuter games but should not be confused with architecture."
3,5 Bucks Wal Mart,I got this CD for 5 bucks at Wal Mart. Has most of their hits live. I prefer the studio versions. It's not bad for quadruple platinum heavy metal rockers.
4,Great snapshot of a great band!!,"This CD is a very accurate snapshot of Cinderella on the Rock Never Stops Tour in 2005. The band is tighter and in my opinion the sound is better overall than ""Live at the Key Club"" as live albums go. There are a few tunes from that year's setlist that are my faves that didn't make the cut, but overall a very good CD. If you saw the 2005 tour this is a must-have souvenir (and a lot cheaper than the $35 t-shirts!) If you missed it - shame on you... but, it's a great way to hear what you missed!"
3,"Lidie, slow moving but a good read","This historical fiction was loaded with interesting twists and characters; however, it was a little slow moving. Yet, I still enjoyed reading about Lidie and the cast of New Englander struggling in the KT. The ever present theme of preventing slavery from moving into the KT and the challenges of life on the prairie kept my interest."
5,"A Fun, Interesting Read","This is my first Jane Smiley book and I loved her characters, the fluidity of the writing, and the story line. Never a dull moment! It takes place during a historical period that I deeply enjoy--around the Civil War. The characters are easy to like, if not believable, and I found myself anxious to get home and read the book when I was away from it! Best of all, Smiley is realistic in how she ends the book. They don't always have to end ""happily ever after..."""
4,A great read!,"The range of issues covered by Jane Smiley in her last three works is extensive. She has gone from family relationships (A Thousand Acres) to academic institutions (Moo) to a much larger palette in this novel with her snapshot of Kansas in 1855. Although I found the first half of the novel at times tedious (possibly a reflection on the New England characters that frequent it?), the second half (where Lidie is on her own) is compeling. It is a fascinating study of her emerging self-awareness and self-worth. She learns in the process that life's situations are not black or white but most often gray."
3,Historical revelation as experienced by a feckless settler,"Affords the reader insight into the twisted reactions of men and women caught in the slavery issue during the red hot debate over which philosophy of government would rule Kansas. Frontier is opening up and the Boston proper looking for a breath of fresh air arrive hoping to get a claim and claim a life. The author brings that to a surprising crash and lets us watch an amazing transformation that for women, affords information about the struggle between the sexes for power and governments for power. The characters are sterling, people you want to know more about, the setting believable, the events go along calmly with sudden shock along the way. For anyone with an interest in history, seeing how civil rights and feminine rights have grown up out of the last century, or seeing how much people gave up to make our ""good life"" possible on the plains...this is a book to read and to enjoy."
2,Lost my interest after awhile...,"This was a very absorbing book at the beginning. But by the middle I was bored. The characters were no longer interesting at all. Even Lidie who was, after all, the focus of the story and, thus, the most well-developed character became frustrating to me. I was no longer rooting for her, even though I wanted to. The beginning of the book was great; maybe that's why I expected more out of it."
3,"Liddie, slow moving but a good read","This historical fiction was loaded with interesting twists and characters; however, it was a little slow moving. Yet, I still enjoyed reading about Liddie and the cast of New Englander struggling in the KT. The ever present theme of preventing slavery from moving into the KT and the challenges of life on the prairie kept my interest."
2,An Unabsorbing Read,I recommended this book to my book club based on the good reviews on Amazon. The night of our discussion only one person had finished the book. The others could not get through it.
5,"Slow at first, but I'm so glad I stuck with it","I first read this book in high school, and it left a lasting impression on me. It is one of the books which I re-read every few years, (I don't re-read very many books, so that's saying a lot.) When I first began the book, I though of it as a comfort book, you know, the kind where nothing really happens, and everything turns out perfectly in the end. But it was not like that at all. I was shocked during many parts of the novel. And things stuck with me even when I put it down. This will sound strange, but while reading this book I felt like I was dreaming. Anyway, it's an amazing book and I loved it. It gets better everytime I read it."
3,the subject of the novel merits better writing than this,"the story of the wooing, wedding and widowing of young Lidie Newton in the tumultuous middle years of 19th century America is told by jane smiley at a frantic pace. Characterisation and credibility are weak: some of the key personalities such as Thomas Newton and Lidie's nephew Frank never come alive on the page, and to this reader at least the miscarriage suffered by Lidie and indeed her later return to Quincy read as news items inserted into the story rather than as integral to the development of the novel"
1,absolutely deadly,"I couldn't even finish it! And I loved Moo and 1000 Acres! Too treatise-like, not novel-ly enough; the characters held no interest for me. Ah, well...."
1,Very boring.,"I can almost always finish a book, but I couldn't finish this one. Very tedious and boring. That surprised me, because I've loved her other books, especially ""A Thousand Acres."""
3,Entertaining if you're stuck for something to read,"Once I got past the first chapter or two I couldn't put it down. The writing is good. Unfortunately, the story loses its punch as it progresses. Too bad -- I really liked Lidie. Read this book if you're stuck at your in-laws' house for a week (as I was) and there's nothing good on TV."
3,Interesting and sometimes boring presentation.,"Some of Smiley's characters were simply unbelievable. I kept thinking the book would get better, so I kept reading. In that way the story did pull me in. The second half of the book did not live up to the ""build up"" of the first half. In the end , Lidie was a disappointment to me. She lost her fine resolve and was pretty confused by life, or so it seemed to me. The boy Frank dropped out way to early from the story and his demise simply wasn't plausible based on the way in which his character was initially drawn. The book didn't hold together well. It was full of ambiguity. It had moments of greatness and then would drop back into a fit of inaness and boring transgression. I'm glad I read it; I learned a bit about abolitionist history, but it left me feeling hollow."
5,why pay more?,"I was a bit hesitant to by this particular Korean make. But the risk paid off. The picture is excellent and the subtitles--English, Korean, etc.--are easily removeable and switchable. So don't get ripped off by those who have you over a barrel at $149.00?!As for the film itself: it is one of those rare gems that proves less is more. The only minor complaint I have is the mellowdrama created during a hidden camera interview with an SS man; the director cuts back and forth to the van outside that is stealthily recording the interview. That is the only brief heavy handedness in what is otherwise a masterpiece."
4,Good music from an underrated Composer,"Symphony's 3 & 5, released on this same label-by the same forces, is a much better starting point for those interested in this ignored composer. This disc is good, not excellent like those symph aforementioned, but after listening to them, if this composer is your cup of tea, by no means wait. His music is like an oriental bartok, infused with a much more authentic eastern european flavour than you will hear elsewhere. Overall, this composer deserves much more attention than he is getting, and CPO should be applauded for this cycle of his music, which will soon be concluding with a survey of his string quartets. For discophiles, there is also a more than adequate release of Saygun's first symphony on the Koch label, though the orchestra is better hear.(Koch: Howard Griffiths-Northern Sinfonia..recorded 1995), though the coupling Saygun's Concerto da Camera op 62 which will not, for some reason, be included in CPO survey, though it is a very good piece."
2,Rather disappointing.,"I think those readers who are interested in erotic stories may find the selections in this audio tape a bit ""technical"" sounding. The terminology used fell short of my definition of eroticism. I would pass on this selection."
2,don't bother,Waste of money if you are not into the girl- girl thing- nearly every story has it. And the ones that don't are worse. terrible. Bad writing-
2,garmin gpsmaps 3205 died,"I recently purchased and installed a Garmin GPSMAP 3205 on my 30 ft sailboat for a trip from Bay City, Michigan to Erie, Pennsylvania. It worked fine for the first three days, on the fourth day the screen went black, although the buttons still beeped when pushed. Checked the backlight setting, nothing helped. Eventually it just died altogether. Checked all connections and they were sound. had to buy a handheld to finish the trip. Not happy with the product, returning it asap"
5,Garmin 3205,"Great over all product. Great price. Quick delivery. With basic skills you can install this. Linking to other units, i.e. AIS radio connection is a little more complicated. I have hooked these up before so kind of knew what to look for. Remember that to get the AIS radio to see the GPS that you have to change the default setting in the GPS to match the required setting of the specific AIS radio. My GPS is connected to a Standard Horizon Radio and it works great."
1,garmin 3205 chartplotter,"do not buy unless you are planning to spend a few days installing it, nothing but a lot of loose wires"
5,A different kind of band!,"It's hard to find something new in the world of music these days. But here's something you don't find everyday. Christian Techno!! This is there second album, and along with the RhythmSaints, unfortunately disappeared before they ever appeared here in the states. I am selling a two disc set in the listings of Used CDS for this album. Check it out."
1,"Phone Complains ""Unauthorized Charger""","Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr, the phone complains that this an ""Unauthorized Charger"" and it will not charge the phone. Do not waste your time with this."
2,I think this charger UN-charges my phone,"I agree with most of the others, it worked okay for a couple of months... now, not only does it not charge my phone, but if I plug it into my phone, it immediately loses all charge! It's also always falling out of the lighter plug. I don't have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets."
3,Adequate for the purpose,"It works, it's cheaply made, and it is about half the price of Motorola's. Don't expect much more from it."
1,total junk,"I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck, but they are complete junk. They worked, but never well, for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit!"
1,Product Broken,"A useless piece of junk. Worked for 3 minutes then broke. Have since bought a Motorola-brand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk. Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you DONT pay for in this case)."
3,good effort,"The first charger sent to me was a cheap crappy one that didn't work. After the company found out they sent me 2 new ones from cingular, yet it looks nothing like the original one I already have from cingular. They seem to work, but I'm not sure how good yet or even if they drain the battery rather than charging...I'm sorta scared to find out-in fear of ruining my phone. I'll just buy direct from cingular next time. Just remember, you get what you paid for in this case."
1,Vehicle Charger for Motorola Razr,The Premium Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible. I returned it
1,not good at all,It broke after one day. Dont bother. If you buy one from cingular it comes with a 1 year warranty....
1,Product did not work at all.,"One star was the lowest rate the site allows so that's what I gave it.The delivery was prompt and the co. seemed like it was wanting to please the customer, since they did send a chatty follow up email, but, if the product is totally non functional..."
1,Damaged my cell phone,"I purchased the car charger, but unknow to me, the charger had a broken pin. It wasn't until I was not able to charge my cell phone that I realized that the pin in my cell phone was broken. I then realized that the broken pin in the car charger caused the pin in my cell phone to break. I am going to seek my recovery of my expense for replacing my cell phone $210.00.The charger would be great if it was not for its broken pin. I like the placement of the operational light."
1,Dead on Arrival,"There may be third party chargers that do the job, but not this one. It never worked. Save your money."
5,Life Changing Book,"Mark Buchanan tells us what most Christians secretly suspect: We are too cozy with the god of our choosing, the safe god, the ""it's ok, I understand"" god. His focus is to get to (re)know the God who hates sin, who hates sloth, and who loves us enough to be the God that isn't safe, but is good"
3,Book,"I was surprised and disappointed that the new book had bent corners from start to end. First time this has happen on a new book. Didn't see any damage on shipment, It looks like they sent it that way, the other book was fine. I can still enjoy the book, but when I pay for a new book I don't expect bent corners. Rae"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book with abundant enthusiasm that it would help me become closer to God. No offense to the writer, whom I'm sure is a wonderful man, but I can't bring myself to finish this book. The whole idea of the book is to leave ""borderland"" and experience a God who isn't just ""safe"" and kept at a distance. But this book is so uninteresting to me that the book itself doesn't seem to have left ""borderland"" yet. The author seems to drag things out quite a bit etc. One day I'm going to force myself to finish reading this book which I forced myself so far to get halfway through it. I'm hoping the last part of the book is better than the first half."
5,A CHRISTIAN CLASSIC,"Mark Buchanan is surely among the finest Christian writers of our day. His scriptural insights, lucid illustrations, and moving anecdotes ring true and speak profoundly to the modern Christian reader. Buchanan delves deeply into the realities of spiritual struggle and discouragement; of joy and discipline. I remember turning to a friend once and crying out, ""How hard is this (Christianity) supposed to be?!"" Buchanon answers that question, and others, with eloquence I have rarely seen matched. I'm on my second reading of the book and have bought twelve copies to give to friends. Of the two young pastors I have given copies to, both have passed additional copies along to others, and have raved about it. Read it!"
5,Under the Radar DVD,Excellent movie..we are big Dario fans met him many times..super nice man..the quality was excellent and the price was afforable..we all enjoy watching this movie my grandson plays it alot because he races his indy cars to it..I highly recommend this company for their products..
3,Frodus Rule Roadside suck,This split ep diffenently has some of the better songs roadside monument did but they are still boring. Luckily Frodus has two songs so it makes this album all worth while(especialy if your a big fan of either band)
4,Charger works fine in Honda Odyssey,"After only 1 day of use, everthing seems fine. The charger has a green LED when nothing is plugged in and a red led when charging. The plug fit a VX6100 nicely. The cord is short, heavily curled, which was fine for me... some people may need a longer cord. Build quality and materials seemed good.I'm surprised the previous review said that the charger was too short to fit in several cars. There is about an inch sticking out when plugged into a Honda Odyssey's aux socket (cigarette lighter socket)."
1,Same charger connector cannot fit all LG phones,"LG phones have 3+ types of connectors, so this vehicle power charger cannot fit all models. I am writing this review to spare Amazon and fellow shoppers the pain of returning this item.WalMart sells 3 types of LG chargers for $9.74 online and in stores, and I love their helpful packages. They list the models supported and extend the connectors outside, so we may try to plug the connectors in our phones before we buy or open the packages."
1,Doesnt work with LG 7000,"Shows ""incompatible charger "" when plugged in with both my LG phones. Returning it for a refund."
4,Waksman: intelligent and gifted,"I would like to quickly state my thoughts about Dr. Steve Waksman. Although I have not yet been able to read through the entire book, I have read many sections of it. Dr. Waksman is a professor of mine at Miami University in Oxford, Oh. Throughout the semester he taught me a countless amount of information on the guitar and the history of Rock n' Roll. Out of all my classes I have ever been enrolled in, his American Studies class has not only been the most interesting, but I have also gained the most out of it. I am about to start reading the book and I'm sure I won't be able to put it down. Thanks Dr.Waksman! Sincerely, Joe Rada"
4,Hip-hop for christians,"Lakita's CD is one of the first female christian hip-hop/r&b CDs that has actually measured up to the secular market. This CD includes some fast beats, singing, and rap, comparable to a fast-moving TLC.Lakita's voice is pretty, the songs are hooky, and the rapping is definitely up to par. If you are looking for a christian hip-hop album that you can dance to, this is the one."
5,Lakita sets a new standard in music.,"Lakita puts her positive message of purity to some of the best music I have ever heard. The songs will stay with you through out the day. Her attitude is contagious. This is my all time fav CD. If you only buy one CD this year, make it this one. It is a great gift to teen-agers that love the R&B sound."
5,If there was one cd to live with this one would be it!,Lakita is so good. I've been looking for a cd with beaty r&b type stuff. This one certainly fits the catagory. There is alot of talent in the voices. I guess i could say its inspirational to me! I listen to 24/7
3,wedding bands,"We bought this wedding bands because we were in a rush. We decided in a Saturday to go next weekend to Vegas to get married and we need it something fast and cheap.For using a couple of months are fine, but they got scratched pretty fast, doesn't look as good anymore, and I'm working at a computer all day long. So I think you should buy something with more karats."
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"If you are looking for Japanese accents to your home, this is not the book for you. I was disappointed as there were only very few references to Japanese design. Some rooms were overly decorated and looked too busy that one cannot enjoy the ""beautiful objects and exotic materials."" Too gaudy for me. I would much rather go for the simplicity of the Japanese home."
4,west meets east,"This is an excellent book for the westerner who wants to introduce an eastern thematic decor to your home, e.g., cabinets, art pieces, tonality and color, while maintaining elements of western living, e.g., western chairs and eating tables. It provides a range of eastern styles and elements that is ideally suited to one seeking a selection of pieces from various eastern cultures. If you are seeking the zen setting of a pure japanese style, this is not the right book."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"Thinking this was a freshly re-mastered collection of Valens' greatest, I was heartily disappointed with the muddy sound. Don't waste you money on this, try ""The Ritchie Valens Story"" cd on the Del-Phi label or better yet, listen to Los Lobos' take on Valens hits on the digitally recorded La Bamba Soundtrack."
3,Speaking with Tongues . . .,This is a fictional tale of erotic encouters delivered in an audio format.The tape documents soon very steamy encounters indeed.
2,Plastic Floater...,"I've had glass water bottles before and never had a problem. When I got mine, though, I was disappointed. There was a small plastic floater inside the glass bottle, and try as I may, I couldn't get it out. I know people who buy glass bottles typically do so because animals will chew on them and that can be bad for their health, however, the toxins in plastic can leech out into water, so having any plastic prolonged direct contact with water is a bad idea. Most people probably aren't worried about one tiny floater, and because this is only my rabbits travel bottle I'm not too concerned. But if the product description had said there was a floater then I wouldn't have bought this product."
4,It does the job,"1. It looks cool with the silver metal accents, tinted glass, illuminated interior with a cool blue light, and metal racks.2. It keeps the bottles at an even temperature regardless of the ambient temperature which as anyone knows is the greatest factor in wine stability.3. It doesn't have settings for humidity or dual-zone temperatures, but quite honestly I don't plan on keeping expensive 100-year old bottles stored in this thing that require such exquisite delicacy.4. It is super-quiet. All you hear is a fan that turns on and off occasionally. I have it next to my hi-fi system and there is absolutely no interference whatsoever.5. If you want a good-looking wine storage appliance that has a small footprint and keeps your bottles cooler than your pantry and warmer than the fridge without extra hassles, then this is the product for you."
1,Would NOT buy Haier brand ever again,"We bought one of these 14 months ago. It just stopped working one day. The repair service person quoted us ~$220 to repair it! It cost us less to buy it. The unit seem to blown a fuse and the whole board needed to be replaced. The design is so poor that it is labor intensive to replace the board. I called Haier to see if they would extend their warranty since the unit malfunctioned just 2 months after their 1-year warranty policy. They would not extend or do anything. In fact, they recommend I do not have the unit repaired. They said I should toss it and just buy a new one!!! The service company they referred me to claimed they don't like repairing the unit because it is time consuming and the lead time to get the board is long. They only warrant the repair for 90 days. So now we are using it as a wine rack! Bummer!!! DON'T BUY FROM HAIER...BAD DESIGN AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
2,Not so good,"Bought this at Lowes for $150. Returned it a few weeks later. The motor hardly ever shuts off, and when it does, it will for about 15 seconds and then start again. And this was while it was on its lowest setting for reds. Plus the motor is not ""whisper quiet"" as they claim. Kind of sounds like a small fan running. My friend has a larger model and it makes no such noise. Does cool fine though."
1,haier wine cooler,"TERRIBLE! Did not live long, very loud, finally started leaking and RUINED my hard wood floor. DO NOT PURCHASE!!! Not even worth one star rating but no other options are available."
1,Wine cooler,I have 6 of these and everyone of these died around 13 months. Each relative that reci\eived these for Christmas has the same problem.
2,It lives up to the Reviews,"Like almost everyone on here, or at least the ones that have had the unit for just over a year, mine has stopped working. My wife and I got this from Bed Bath & Beyond and enjoyed the unit and liked how it looked next to our bar. But a year passed and one day it just stopped working, no lights, no fans, nothing at all. We were out of town when it happened and figured that the person watching the house had left the door slightly open and the motors overheated. Then we saw the reviews online and it confirmed the problem.This item is great to look at and the perfect height to set next to most bar settings in your home, but its not worth 200, which we paid, if you KNOW its going to break down after a year. I mean there isnt even any surprise at this point, if you buy one its going to break."
3,cycles too much,"Haier HVW18BSS 18-Bottle Wine Cellar, SilverA. It looks great and holds the proper temp.B. Fans run for about 55 seconds and then off for 40 seconds. So the fan noise can become annoying."
1,Broke after 4 months,"This thing worked well until it broke 4 months later. I didn't stress it by putting it on a cold setting, it just quit. No power is getting to the unit, and the light won't even turn on. Shipping on the warranty is cost prohibitive, better to just buy a more reputable wine cooler. Furthermore, if you live in a southern state, you should avoid thermoelectric based coolers in general. They are cheap, and use less electricity, and are do not result in wide swings in temperature as compared to compressor based units. However, in order to avoid stressing them they have to be within a nice mild ambient temperature range. In the summer I program my thermostat to go up during the day while I'm away from home. This raises the temperature to an unacceptable level and a thermoelectric will not be able to keep up. If you live in the south, and don't crank up the a/c during the summer, avoid a thermoelectric."
1,very poor product,"We purchased one of these wine coolers in October of 2007. It failed( stopped to cool) in March of 2008.Haier sent us a replacent for $35 or so in June of 2008. Now in February 2009, that one doesn't work either(no cooling,no lights etc). So we conclude that this product is a poor product.Consider that it has also ruined a good number of fine wines that were worth a lot more than the JUNKY cooler cost to buy. I would avoid them!!"
2,Died at 7 months,"Got this wine refrigerator (in black, not silver) in Dec to replace a Danby that died after about a year. Loved the size since it fits easily in tight spaces. Unfortunately it stopped cooling. We noticed the wines didn't seem to be getting very cold, so we took them all out and let it cool down empty. That seemed to work but after putting all the bottles back, (and they were all cold since we put them in the refrigerator) they just got warm again. All the lights and fan still work, just doesn't stay cold. Called the Haier number, they said there is no repair for not cooling and they would send a new one. You have to send them the serial tags, receipt, 8-in of the power cord and check for $14.99 for ""partial"" shipping charges. They will send one FEDEX. We've decided to go ahead and try one more time since we really liked it when it worked, but if that one dies too we won't waste another $14.99. I'm hoping they have improved in the last six months, but not necessarily counting on it."
1,Noisy,"Noisy, on & off every minute or two. Would not recommend. Hope it breaks soon, so I can throw it out"
2,"Looks good, noisy and broke down after 8 months.","The Good:1.The wine cooler is nice looking. It is tall and narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of room.The Bad:1. The fans cycle on and off very frequently and the noise they make is obnoxious.2. The unit never got down below 50 degrees.3. After 8 months it would not get below 65 degrees.The fans run, it just doesn't get cold.The Ugly:1. For a warranty replacement, Haier requires you to send several items including the power cord at your expense.They also charge $14.99 to ship you a replacement unit. That doesn't seem right. They should apologize forselling a cooler that has a life span of a gnat, and replace it free of any charges.Bottom Line:1. Look for a higher quality brand from a more reputable company.2. Enjoy your next cool bottle of wine."
2,Didn't last a year!,"Looks nice and has a compact foot print but does not last. Wish I had read the reviews before buying ths unit. Mine stopped working after 8 months, completely dead. That seems to be the trend here."
1,On Off On Off On Off Repeat,The product looks great and maintains the desired temperature. But in the minute it has taken me to write this the unit will have cycled on a off twice. I guess it is OK if the unit is nowhere near people.
1,BUYER BEWARE OF HAIER!!!,"AVOID THIS COMPANY!! My unit arrived broken. Haier customer service was rude & obnoxious. They were completely unapologetic & seemed to go out of their way to be UNHELPFUL. When I finally bullied them into action, they wanted a full week to send out a service man who may or may not have been able to fix it. I spoke to both customer service and corporate, both were extremely rude and entirely useless. What's more, neither one had the decency to so much as apologize. NEVER AGAIN.This was every internet buyer's nightmare!"
1,Snakey company,"Simply put, this product is a guranteed defeat. These pieces of crap are intentionally designed to fail shortly after the warranty passes. This company is completely unaware of the term ""Customer Service."" If getting ripped off or over-paying to rent a wine fridge for a few months sounds good to you, then this is the product for you!!!!!"
5,You can actually write on it wiht pencil and erase it easily,"I buy this wall calendar every year, because it's the only one I've found that has a non-glossy finish on the paper. I don't like a messy looking, scribbled on calendar. This calendar has enough room to write down multiple ""to do's"". My family's schedule is always changing and because of the non-glossy finish I can cleanly erase the penciled in events and write in changes."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I ordered these for my Girlfriend. They stones BOTH had large defects (I'm no expert in diamonds, so I dunno what it's really called). By defects I mean both stones had HUGE black flecks in them. At least they were symmetrical. :/ Anyways....other than that...they were great....at least I didn't make this mistake with an engagement ring."
3,Review,I was somewhat disappointed in that one of the studs did not have an anchor back to hold it. Other than that they were above average for the cost.
5,diamond earring,I bought 3 pairs one for each of my three daughters for Christmas and they loved them. I was very pleased.
3,"More like ""bling"" and not ""BLING""","The earrings took a awhile to arrive; when it did, it was packaged well. I thought the tw 1/3 would be a little bigger however, it is a nice ""bling"" for the price."
1,Wrong size,I would like to warn everyone who purchases this item to measure them when you get it!I probably would not have been able to tell the difference if this was not a replacement set for a lost earring... but they sent me a 1/10 carat when it should have been this (1/3 carrot) I did some research when I opened it and found the dimensions it should have been and it was exactly .10 X .10 inches and 3mm X 3mm for you metric folk.BUYER BEWARE!
3,"Ok, For DOS Programming","It's a GREAT book for DOS programming, but didn't have enough information on Windows programming. There was only one chapter on Windows programming. Great for new assembler language programers, but not for advanced programers and Windows programers."
4,Great for Little Ones with Sensitive Skin Prone to Eczema,"My little boys have very sensitive skin and putting their old sunscreen (WaterBabies or AveenoBaby) on them everyday would irritate their skin. They are also prone to eczema. When using Baby Lizard it did not irritate their skin at all and gives great protection from the sun! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it's pretty pricey, but a little bit does go a long way!"
5,Beautiful!,I ordered one of these dragons for my friend in another state about two months ago. I wasn't actually able to see what this pendant looked like until my friend came and visited me a week ago. I just adored the size and quality of the pendant that I had to order a second one for my self! The pendant is huge! Absolutely lovely and a must have for any Asian dragon collector =D.
5,Delicious!,"Healthy & delicious, I've been eating this since my youth every morning for breakfast. Chock full of B vitamins - superb!"
3,Less that the title suggests,"The books is composed of five lectures on Early Oriental-Greek interactions: 1) Alphabetic Writing; 2) Orientalizing Features in Homer; 3) Oriental Wisdom Literature and Cosmogony; 5) Orpheus and Egypt; and 5)The Advent of the Magi (total, 124 pages plus bibligraphy and notes). I.E., no general framework is provided on Oriental-Greek relations, only some interesting but few issues are treated.In my opinion, that is rather poor for a book whose subtitle is ""Eastern Contexts of Greek Culture"". I would much rather reccomend ""The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies""by Thomas McEvilley."
3,Good logo,"I do not like curved bills on caps and this has a good curve to it (limits side vision). But other than I don't like the design, it is a quality product with a beautiful logo. But I found better prices elsewhere with equal quality. Like the girl said on the record: Shop around."
1,Not worth the money,"The unit was bought for my 11 year old daughter. She used it until with one set of batteries without a problem, then after she changed them a ""door open"" sign flashed on te screen making the unit useless. I do not recommend it."
3,"Mild, but still leaves the baby stains","I had to discontinue using this detergent! It is mild, but it's cleaning effectiveness is FAR less than ""regular"" detergent. After washing, the clothing still felt as if it needed washing. I ended up buying another name brand detergent that was free of dyes or perfumes which cleaned a lot better. This product may be adequate for everyday washing of sheets, towels, etc, but I would use a stronger detergent for the baby food stains and soils."
5,Hilarious show from the 50s,"As soon as I got my copy I put it into the dvd player and watched the first two episodes. I cannot remeber when I laughed so hard. I love these comedies from the 50s, 60s and 70s. I was very young when this show first aired, and I remeber watching it. But I did not remember any of the plots. Now I see this was definitely a very funny show. Please put out all seasons of this show. Thanks."
5,Finally on dvd!,"This is a great show to watch with the family! I'm much younger than the show, so I never saw it when it aired, but came to love it watching reruns of it on television. I taped as many as I could and watched it a lot. Thankful they have released it on dvd now. And the last disk has a bonus episode of THE DONNA REED show where ""Dennis"" makes a guest appearance. Love that! These classic family shows from the 50's and early 60's are just a joy to watch! So happy the have season 1 of ""Dennis the Menance"" to add to my collection. Hope they release season 2 soon!"
5,good stuff,Loved this growing up. Brings back a lot of memories and I am happy that it is so easily available.
3,Freeze,Tried to watch last night. Kept freezing up and would not play for more than 3 minutes at a time.
5,OH GREAT SCOTT!!!!,"This was a classic series that is long overdue as to being released. Dennis rates right up there with Leave it to Beaver and has a legion of fans. Granted the show went down hill a tad during the last year after Joseph Kearns (original Mr Wilson) died suddenly and Jay North was getting to old for the role. Hard to believe, but some parents from that era reacted to Dennis the same way parents today have reacted to Bart Simpson and kept the show off limits. In truth, Dennis was/is a harmless kid both in the comic strip and on TV. He was toned down a bit for TV as he was not quite as brash as he was in the comic strip. The only exception was the pilot episode where he was something of a bad kid."
5,I Love This Old TV Show,"I love watching the old tv shows from years ago. This is a funny show. Dennis the Menace gets his self in such mischief and loves to get Mr. Wilson upset. But deep inside I know Mr. Wilson loves the little guy! LOL!! But with all the garbage that is shown on TV these days, it pays to stick to the old retro tv shows because you know you are getting good wholesome clean tv. Especially with a series like Dennis the Menace."
5,The whole family LOVES this!,Having fond memories of watching reruns of this as a child made me think that my elementary school aged children would enjoy it too. I was so right! They think it's hilarious! They especially love it when Dennis bothers Mr. Wilson! It's wholesome viewing for all ages. I highly recommend it to everyone.
5,This SEASON 1 set is so much fun!,"So happy Dennis the Menace Season 1 has finally been released. We are so enjoying these old episodes and the interviews with cast members Margaret and Dennis' mother. Just charming stories and the transfers to DVD are wonderful, too. The price is excellent for this 32 episode set!"
2,Fair,Bad DVD defected I played it and the first DVD was defected and i was disppointed in it big time .
5,dennis the menace:season 2,"Great dennis the menace episode, has a great cast around him,full of laughts and Dennis is a good example for kids today to follow!"
2,"Great Show for Kids, too expensive for parents",The DVD is 21.99 and the download is 51.99 go figure. I give it 2 star only because of the price
1,Herotica without the erotic.,"I was looking for some hot bed time reading. This isn't it. As erotic fiction this is merely fiction. And boring fiction at that.I wanted some hot action and some romance and some surprises, I didn't get it. (Mind you, I wanted cool hot action, graceful, romantic, sensual. No fear of raw animal sex here since there's very little sex in this).The only hot thing about this book is on the cover. What's on the pages is disappointing."
4,If you are wondering.....,"I think at least 10 of these 26 stories gave a satisfying answer to that question. Congratulations to the writers and editors. Ladies, you're just great!"
2,Bowdlerized Aristophanes!,"I can accept some stilted language; after all, some of these translations are about a century old. I can accept the lack of notes. But I can not accept translations of Aristophanes that cut some of his funniest scenes!For instance, in the translation of Thesmophoriazusae, the unmasking of Mnesilochus (line 600 and after) is gutted. Lines 610-617 are gone (Mnesilochus' urination excuse), but more importantly, the whole climax of the scene -- the hilarious physical comedy where he tries to maintain his female disguise (lines 643-649) -- is nowhere to be seen.It's hard to imagine that an editor would allow 19th century prudery to ruin a 20th century edition of Aristophanes, but there you are.Despite the cheap price, this book is no bargain. Spring for the more expensive (if a bit less literal) Penguin versions."
2,Disappointed by a Bad Translation,"The plays of Aristophanes comic masterpieces, but not in these old-fashioned, stilted translations. I have read other translations of some of these plays. When properly translated, they are witty in much of their wordplay, frequently ribald and often funny. The language of the present translations, on the other hand, is stiff, obscure and scarcely readable. The publisher has done us a great service by compiling all of the Aristophanes plays into a single volume, but should reissue the collection in a better, more modern translation, one which does justice to the original."
1,a dreadful translation of classic work,"do NOT purchase this translation. it makes one of the funniest writers of all time boring. this translation is as bad as the previous reviewers have indicated. the best, and most hilarious, translation that i've seen is a 1938 version that , i think, eugene o'neill worked on as an editor or something. however, aristophanes should definitely be checked out by afficionados of ancient greek literature as well as anyone interested in comic writing that'll make you laugh out loud. he's one of the titans of world literature."
4,laugh with the Greeks,"Aristophanes lived about 2400 years ago, and wrote comedies. While there are a lot of references to personalities and problems of ancient Athens that will not mean anything to us, there is plenty that is funny and risque enough to entertain anyone with an interest in the ancient Greeks."
2,Good book but not NXT,"I bought this book to get a better understanding of the Mindstorm NXT system. While this book is very interesting, it does not cover NXT -- so the descriptions of the programming, the sensors, even the basic lego pieces do not match what you'd get in a NXT package."
4,Hardcore is so nice,"This ep is an excellent buy. The music is solid, the singer has a high scream, and the guitars are fast and boast some speedy riffs. Eventually the band Project 86 came from some of the members of this band. Very nice."
1,Not worth it,"This Strategy guide is not worth money. The training session on the game is more than enough. If you played the series you would have a good feel for 2002. This guide give some information on particular teams (plays), nothing that you can't figure out. To keep it short this guide has nothing new in it. No cheats, codes or any of the sort. Has team information which you can get from magazines, internet."
2,"Good for general info, but . . . .","lacking in ways to improve. It does a good job of breaking down all of the plays and tendencies, but that's about it. I highly suggest VG Sports online guides. Much more helpful."
1,Disappointed,"Cuando yo compre la guia, pense encontar mas datos sobre jugadas y codigos que me ayudarán en el juego mas esto no fue asi.la guia te ilustra muy bien las Key-play para cada equipo pero encuentro muy limitada la explicaciones del mismo.Creo que para poder jugar bien el juego, tu no necesitas de esta guia, mejor practica en el juego y te ira mejor.Otra observación la mayoria de codes y cheats son para playstation 2...si tu tienes la version PC, de nada te servira."
5,"Destiny Road ,for a smooth ride",Recently saw this group in a small theatre and had to get this cd fast.I've been a Peter Green fan for many years and love the mix of blues/jazz.Will be sending copies to friends who i know will get into this music and love it.
1,Not worth the plastic it was encoded on,"This video looks like it was put together in someone's basement with a Commodore 64. The production values are of the poorest quality, but they look good compared to the awful script they force Christopher Lee to mouth.The film clips look like they were copied from TV trailers and Lee has a blue chromakey halo around him. The only way I can figure they got him to appear in this bottom-of-the-barrel production is that his taxes were due and he was strapped for cash.The content ignores the history of both print and film science fiction, instead larding on purple prose to cover poor research.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,"High Energy, Christian sounding with a good beat.",My favorite song on this cd is Praise song. it's danceable and emotional. the whole cd is a positive Christian sound experience.
5,Took Care Of The Problem,"I used this cleaner for a mold and mildew problem around my windows in the bedrooms and it has been almost a month and the mold or mildew hasn't come back yet. Since this product contains bleach it will discolor your paint. You should have some extra paint the same color of your wall to touch up the areas you intend to spray. Also the fumes can be dangerous if breathe in so you will need to open up the windows first and wear a mask to cover your nose and mouth. I would also recommend latex cleaning gloves to protect your hands. This product may sound too harsh but that is what it takes to get rid of the problem, something strong. The other alternative would be to pay a professional hundreds to thousands of dollars to break out your walls and do it. I sure would rather pay less than $5.00 a bottle than to pay hundreds. Now if you want to take care of mold and mildew in your bathroom then this product is perfect. It works great on tile and also in and around tubs."
4,"Smells awful, works great.","This product will remove every nose hair you have due to its incredible stench, but it destroys mildew and stains like a champ.I sprayed it on my nylon fabric shower curtain after washing/other chemicals failed and it looks new after only 30 min of soaking.In the future, however, I will bring the curtain outdoors so it can be hosed down after cleaning: the smell didn't leave my bathroom for about 2 days!"
3,It's just one bottle.....,"The product is excellent, but the ad must be off......you only get one bottle so I can't believe it was originally $64... I assumed it would be more than one bottle at that original price. My mistake but the ad is confusing."
5,Excellent reference tool,"This book is excellent, and I feel compelled to write my own review after seeing the poor reviews it has suffered here. This book is not a full grammar, but for someone who has taken an introductory course and needs something 'at hand' to check constructions or consult a verb table, it is indispensable."
2,Useful but could be better.,"This grammar booklet is a useful addition to the CLC textbooks, but has two major flaws in my opinion: 1. Grammar wise it is very incomplete (e.g. hardly any clear info on the use of cases). I realize it is a supplement to a reading method, but I am frustrated in a similar way with the actual CLC textbook which at times provides little clarity to the students. 2. The lay-out and print are rather unclear (too much text on one page)."
3,Horror muzak for parties.,"If you are looking for a solid collection of classic horror themes recreated as heard in the movies, then you had better look elsewhere. This collection is not for you. Various musicians either play respectable covers of classic themes (i.e. The Exorcist or Halloween) or completely slaughter them with poppy covers. Harry Manfredini's already silly disco-pop theme to Friday the 13th Part 3 is destroyed so badly you would think that Jason Voorhees himself had stomped into the recording studio. Fans of pure, play it like it sounded in the movie recordings will be disappointed."
3,Average collection of cover tunes.,"I've had reasonable luck with Laserlight's Halloween CDs, introducing me to such artist as Screaming Lord Sutch, the Undertakers, and a couple of other minor groups popular for Halloween-themed music.By comparisson, this CD is a relative disappointment, featuring covers of spooky movie and TV themes.Friday the 13th gets butchered the worst, with Exorcist following close behind, primarily by being about a minute to long, and the Twilight Zone is way too funky.Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street fare the best, followed by Jaws and X-files. The rest are tributes to mediocrity.For Wal-Mart's price of under four dollars, it's a decent deal, but I certainly couldn't recommend spending any more than that for it."
2,Want the original songs - look elsewhere...,"I will keep it simple - these are not the original songs from the respective movies. These are different versions created by Roy Shakked. Luckily, Roy is talented and 2 of the songs sound similar to the originals. The rest sound closer to 80's pop."
3,OK,I really didn't like this CD to much. But the Halloween theme save it from mediocrity. It is one of the best versions I have ever heard. I actully do PT/ Run or get hype for football games to it. If you like the Halloween theme then get the CD just for that.
3,Not bad for the price,"It's a mediocre collection of horror movie music. Not bad for the price, but it sounds a bit too synthesizery."
1,dont buy,I wish I had checked the reviews first. These are not original. It showes who wrote the music. I didnt check to see who made the music.
5,life saver,i whent thru 4 other leashes before this one and my do eather snaped or chewed them to death. not a problem with this leash!!!!
2,Not great,Trish was good but thats where it ends. She was let down by a poor cast and average storyline. I would recomend that your money be spent elsewhere. Sorry Trish!!
3,Hot!,"Trish looks hot staring in her own movie! This movie was actually pretty good with a pretty good story and fight scenes. I've seen a really bad movie with Gail Kim in it and that movie totally sucked! But this movie, I actually had a good time watching.If you love to seeing Trish and her kicking butt, then this is your movie!!!"
1,Not so great,"The book is alright at best, no not really it's not that great. And the chick has a hatred for men going on it seems."
4,Great purchase,"45 Master Characters has helped me develop stronger characters and has helped me become a better writer for it. I would recommend this book to any writer who needs some help creating believable characters who come right off the page, ficitional people that us real people can relate to. Definately use this baby as often as possible."
4,Every character you ever needed,"This book covers every character you ever need as a writer. If it has one fault there are probably too many characters for the average writer to get your head round. There is a lot more to this book than just the character types; there is an interesting section on character journeys which realy helps one understand how and why characters are who they appear to be. This book is a great read and should be read again and again to get a real understanding of character. It's not the only way to look at character but it has everything you need to know to write good, deep and meaningful characters. It is female biassed and it is heavily centred on the Greek myths but most writers will be able to get something out of this book.By the author ofCall me Aphrodite"
5,Very Funny With A Great Message,"The Daze Before Christmas is a fun look into the lives of the Taylor family as they prepare for the Christmas Season, but forget about the true meaning of Christmas. From the snow avalanche, to the broken wise man, to the soap filled cookies, firemen at the party and more you won't stop laughing and thinking about Christmas past and present."
1,it ripped,"I had it for a few years but rarely used it. Started working with it again the past couple of weeks, and it ripped nearly in half one day after a few rounds. The fill got in my mouth. No good."
5,slammin',i luv all the songs on this album.They rock!!!!If your not sure if you wanna buy it. i say GET IT!!! you'll be dancing ang singing along with them in no time.
2,MTC fans will be disappointed,"I have to agree with the first reviewer. I loved Making the Connection. I expected a lot more from this book than what I got. Instead of going more in depth, it's more superficial than MTC. In many cases, I felt like he was just repeating his message from the first book, not offering additional insight. I'll never get rid of my copy of MTC, but KTC may end up going to the used book store."
1,Well built but the demensions are way off,The depth is only about 1/2 advertised if you want the magnetic latch to work. But I use it for carrying batteries and memory cards.
4,Good book,"Good book but I always wonder when buying one of the many available, why new ones are so pricey. Is it the publisher?"
1,Yet again Altissimo pirates!,"Here is another example of the blatant piracy of Marine Band performances by Altissimo. This recordinghas been taken from various Marine band recordings and performances and misleads the public in believing that they (Altissimo) were involved in the creative process. There is no crediting of date of performance and more importantly no conductor credits. And I can easily verify that, as I am one of the conductors not credited on a substantial amount of the recordings.Colonel John R. Bourgeois, USMC ret.Director Emeritus, United States Marine Band"
3,Great performances-lacks quality recording,"It is The President's Own and the playing on this is superb. However the recordings were obviously done at many different times and lack a consistent sound quality. Most of these marches appear on some other recording I own, but I was stoked to find all of them on a Marine Corps Band CD. My excitement dwindled with the sonic quality. Oh well."
1,I agree with Colonel Bourgeois! Terrible piracy!,"I will NOT purchase this item! Altissimo should not receive money from official recordings of the Marine Band! God bless you for your many years of high-quality music making Colonel Bourgeois ... is the Marine Band pursuing legal action against these pirates? As a university professor/Director of Bands for 35 years, I have acquired dozens of recordings of ""The President's Own,"" and I am appalled at the audacity of this shoddy outfit that simply ""cuts and pastes"" official recordings together to make a profit. But...doesn't the same thing also happen on iTunes with our other military bands? Unethical people are making money from these recordings! They are specifically issued to be distributed by The Marine Band (or any of the other world-class military musical organizations)--not for profit! Let's get the lawyers involved and shut these guys down!"
4,"Old school reference, but still one of the best.",This is an old school reference but still one of the best resources available to amateur astronomers. It is just full of all the information you could ever want about our universe. And it is organized alphabetically to make finding what you're looking for very easy. This is a three volume set. I came across the first two volumes but was missing the third. I was very happy to find the missing volume on Amazon at a very low price allowing me to complete the set. Thanks again Amazon!
5,Younger Times Happy Memories,"This is one of the best Beach music CDs I have ever bought and I do have a few, I guess what made me buy this one is the fact that I have just recently bought a new car, my first, it is a great cruzin' CD and a wonderful shaggin' CD. I recommend it!"
4,Good Horror,MAHAL is a ghost story and the first ever HORROR film (and quite possibly the best) from India. It is a suspenseful ride filled with NIGHTMARISH elements. Mahal follows a man named Shankar as he moves into a mansionHAUNTED by the woman the former mansion owner was having a affair with.The more Shankar obsesses over her spirit the less control he has over his mind. A must own for HORROR fanatics of all decades and themes.
1,Scary!,"Bought it, got it, installed it. hot water comes out, shut the water off then thats when you'll run to the circuit breaker to shut down the entire line. Big steam comes out once shower is off for a good 20 seconds and scared the s*** out of me. for whatever the reason is, i'm not taking any chances."
4,Good Film,It was a good film. It brings up some interesting ideas as to the answer behind the UFO phenomenon. It also deals with doubt and faith. I would recommend it.
3,Decent Christian movie,"Our family is always excited for the opportunity to watch an overtly Christian movie. This movie was pretty good, not great. (I'd recommend another Christiano film, ""Time Changer"", over this film.) I would have liked to see the Christian characters be less abrasive in the office, a little more Christ-like; they could have reached the same end and been nicer along the way. This movie is not a big alien or UFO movie. It is more about Satan causing UFO-type experiences to make people believe in other life forms and abductions so that when the Rapture occurs and good folks are taken ""up"" out of the midst of everyone else that the remaining people will chalk it up to aliens and not God. It was a fine movie."
2,Ham and cheese sandwich,"I believe there's a need and a role for Christian movies, as a method of both evangelism and entertainment. There's not a need to make more garbage movies, even if it's done by Christians. This is what ""Unidentifed"" is, all's the pity, because the concept had potential.UFO things always sell. And there's a strong belief in the Christian community about a UFO-demonic connection. So we make a movie about it.What you ultimately get, however, is a lot of dangling plot lines that are never resolved, wooden characters, wooden dialogue, illogical conclusions, and ham-fisted proselitzing. This sort of work does more damage to those it's seeking to win over.They get the stars for the effort, not the results."
5,Watch it!!,Sad to see so many lost people. Movie has a great message. Other disappointing reviews are not supprising as these people are typical of the so many worldy lost people who write these critical reviews. Hope God can open there eyes.
2,A big disappointment.,"I'm glad ,that many people liked it, they didn't lose their time and money. I did. If I were not a Christian, I would have just laughed at that, but as I am, I'm very disappointed. Especially after the films I love like Jonathan Sperry and Time Changer."
5,Great DVD Features,"This DVD contains a 40-minute ""making of"" documentary and 2 additional featurettes as well as the trailer and a director/actor commentary."
1,Out of this world bad,"I've been hoping to see a good movie on this subject from a Christian perspective. This isn't it. The premise is good, the storyline and acting stink. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Should have been titled ""Unwatchable""","I can not remember the last time I could not finish watching a movie because it was so boring and slow paced. Sadly, I wasted 45 minutes of my life that I can't get back. I am so glad I only rented it. If you are thinking of watching this, why not just buy a can of paint, paint something, and watch it dry? That would be just as entertaining, and you would have done something productive with some of your time."
1,Terrible,"Wow, this is not to good, the only song ""Dawning Of This Night Divine"" is the only song I've heard and it is horrible. Well it is good if you like Loud, Hurt-Your-Ears, high-piched geetar, that is so loud, that even with the lead singer screaming his lungs out, you still cant hear his voice. And there is no feel to it, you just..... listen to it, it doesent make you want to get up and dance or anything."
3,pretty good.,"the first cd was great. the second (meager) isn't quite the same as the first. it's still good but not the same. as hm's latest interview w/ 90 lb wuss says ""[meager was] an album soaked in chaos and fury"" which is not necesarily a bad thing. the interview also says that their new album ""Short hand operation"" is better and more ""mature"". i haven't bought it yet. personally, i like this cd and can't wait to get the next one!"
4,my review,"ninety pound wuss-most creative an amazing punk band.this cd and all of their cds are amazing,i just wish more people could have seen them live or have boughten an album of theirs...they are awsome.each of there releases gets better and better.if you dont have one yet id say get their first one then work your way up.rock n roll."
1,The biggest disappointment of my music listening life,"I bought this CD without listening (HUGE mistake!) hoping for the intense, fun-loving, wrap-your-self-in-the-microphone-cord, roll-about-on-the-floor-as-if-in-a-seizure thrashing punk I have grown to know and love from the first album and shows. Instead I got a sorry excuse for elevator music. What a suck."
5,It's Hot!!,"This album is the best that I have heard all year from a group. This talented group of young boys are doin it big. They start the album off with something old and end it with something new. Their voices are like bells from heaven. I have to say that my top 3 choices off the album would have to be ""Let It Be, All I Do, and Teacher's Pet"". I wouldn't be surprised at all if this album becomes sold out in just a week or sets a really good sale record. Hey what can you say...They diserve it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,B5 New Album,The album has some nice songs that the fans will enjoy. You can expect everything that a new group would have and better. Just to keep it real I enjoyed it and it's and album that you can buy if you love these boys.
5,B5 Baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This album is soo man there isnt any words to ezplain how good this album is sooooo One of my favorites is Heart Break so if you dont have the album then you need to go out and buy it support B5 the hottes group out now B5 4 Eva baby !!!!! nikki
2,Nothing special and they'll be MIA in a year,"B5 is nothing more than another New Edition clone. I don't know why P. Shi$$y chose these little punks over a legendary gropu like New Edition butI can guartnee they won't have a 20 year carrer like my boys NE. There's no singer in the group who has the vocal ability of say Omarion , Marques Houston or even Ray J for that matter. And the only worthy songs on the Cd are Teacher's Pet & All I Do. All I Do is a cover of the classic Jackson 5 song, that Troop made their own but I don't know who the hell told B5 they could try to make it their own, only the production of Rodney Jerkins saves the songs. Avoid at all costs."
5,B5 cd is da bomb,"I love their cd i didn't skip neither song cause they were all the bomb and i can't wait until theri christmas album comes out so i can get that to.My favorite songs on their are:teacher's pet, alli do, u got me, dance 4 u, so pretty, heartbreak,and nothin bout me."
5,B5 is the best,There are 5 stars for B5. The entire cd has your attention. Every song is a hit and keeps you grooving. Even the slow songs have your ear. I think this is going to be the big hit of the summer. They have everything that good entertainers need.
5,B5's CD,"B5 is the best boy group ever!! They are even better than B2K!!! Their CD is so0o0o0o0oo hott!!! I love it sooo much, i listen to it all the time, in the car, on ma computer, at ma friends house, every where i go!!! I was soo happy i got to the store on time because i got the last copy!!! B5 is soo hott and very very talented!!! Their music is clean so u dont have to worry bout ur parents yelling at u!! Their songs are just soo amazing!! I all ways feel like getting up and just dancing!! u HAVE to get their CD it is the BEST!!! Can't wait till their christmas CD, it comes out on November 22, i'm getting that one too!!! I love u guys keep up the good work!! lOve aLwaYs uR giirL jeSs*"
5,I love b5,"I love b5 a whole lot!!!!!!They're cd is the best and there is NOTHING wrong with 'all i do'. FYI, the jackson 5 sang something like it. These 5 boys are the sexiest boys alive!!!!!!!!!"
5,The B5 Cd,I love the cd.I don't have a fav song i love all 11 tracks.I know the Christmas cd will be good.
5,B5 is the hottest group in music today,"The album is OFF DA CHAIN. They really put it down the way Bad Boy artists put it down. I don't have a favorite song cause the entire album is OUTSTANDING. I think that their album has such a mature feeling to it. I think the songs U Got Me, Teachers Pet, So Pretty, and also Dance for You are just bangers. Matter of fact the whole album is a banger if u don't have it u really need to get it because it's HOTTTTTTTT!"
5,AWESOME,THIS CD IS OFF DA CHAIN.... EVERY SONG ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM IS GREAT!! THIS IS ALL I LISTEN 2 NOW... I THINK THIS IS A GREAT CD.. EVERY BODY AND THEIR MOM SHOULD BUY IT
5,Da hottest album this summer!.....B5's...duh,I LOVE B5'S CD. its so HOT. I love the way their voices sound together. And not to mention the crazi beats. The first song on the album that they sing acapella is mad hot...im like that one alot! Plus the things that they are singing about all touch a spot in my heart!!! That might souind corny but its true! I LOV B5!!!!!! Always LIL EMY
5,b5 is to hot,"when i got this cd it was the first day it came out.i really love this cd.i listen to it 24/7.i like singing the songs on the cd.when i hear All I Do i think about carnell.the cd is to hot to. the boys are so cute,fine,sexy and if they have any more words to say that they are all the words i just said then i would say it but they don't have the word.anyway dustin,kelly,patrivk,carnell,n bryan did there thing on that cd. they really sang there hearts out on it. and if you don't like thim or if u do like them get the cd if you don't have it.so if b5 ever reads this i luv yall.so peace.(get the cd if you don't have it get it)"
5,the album is hooooooooot!,"i love the way they start out the cd with the intro and it has no music so u can really hear them and nothing else.then it has the singles on it that every one likes!And songs that arnet singles but every song lets you get a diffrent feel of all there voices and the lyrics are soooo great,nice,sweet,lovin,and funny.My favorites are u got me,teachers pet and so pretty i love there beats!"
2,B5 needs to grow up,"These guys have to get real. They sing about how they're such a lady's man, but in real life, the stuff they sing about just isn't them. They could be singing mary had a little lam and could still be better then what they sing right now. I'm not saying they're bad, but should sing about what really matters at their age and should grow up. When they are grown up, then they could be singing about this stuff"
2,Not bad for the kiddies,"This album is already I guess, but I'm only going to give B5 star 2 stars because even though they are pretty decent looking, their voices aren't quite up to par(except maybe Dustin). This group has no creativity about them. If your 13 years old or an older person you might see this as real music, but clearly it's not. Puffy has been losing his touch on producing somewhat good quality music. Let's hope their second album(if they get that far) will be better."
4,"b5homegyrl4lyfe"" b5 hott cd","bad boy recording artist b5 cd is hott. my fav. tracks are heartbreak, nothing bout me, let it be, back in your arms, let me know. B5 keep doing your things and please make some more hott cd's. I love you b5 especially carnell aka cnelly"
5,ITS HOTT,THE CD NEVER STOPPED PLAYING SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT. THE SONGS ARE HOT THEY SOUND GOOD THE BEATS ARE HOTT. ITS SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN LISTEN TO PARENT DEFINITELY APPROVE IF U LIKE B2K U SHOULD LIKE THESE GUYS I CAN'T WAIT 4 A SECOND ALBUM!!!
5,Tha B5 album iz soooooooooooooo unbelieveable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LUV THA ALBUM SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!

They just dont have one lead singer all of them put in their share of work. i love B5 to the end and i've suppoted them from the very begining, their album is off the chain eventhough they werent able to write thier own songs this time I know that if they did write their own songs next time the album will be even hotter than now ,and already i cant wait till the next cd hits stores."
5,God I love B5!!!,"B5 is such a supergroup...with songs that you can sleep to and song to dance to, B5 is taking this industry by storm. They have charm, entertaining skills and looks to DIE for[ Patrick, omg!]. These guys are guaranteed a couple more albums and are growing more popular by the day... 10 Thumbs up!!! lol =]"

2,B5 more like B1 (Breeding of 1),"this album sucks only Carnell can sing all the others just yell and scream like little overated punks. the only good song is theachers pet all the other are um u m um FOR TODDLERS AND PARROTS SO THEY CAN SING ALONG. on the song ""DANCE FOR YOU "" they stole the BEAT SOME LYRICS AND THE CHORU.yeah i kind of expected that POP ""FAGOT"" DADDY would do something like this ::: since HE STOLE THE BEAT FROM A SONG FROM THE 2 LIVE CREW FOR BIGGIS 'JUICY'' ITS TRUE THE SONG IS FROM OF THEIR FIRST ALBUM AND IT WAS AND STILL IS AN **UNDERGROUND** **CLASSIC** > and why would they evn think of ruining the classi ""all i do is think of you "" from THE TROOP. this is buble gum crap ++ oh it doesn t have a parental advisory sticker so what this for TEENAGERS not BABy's so buy eithe 112's album or BOBBY VALENTINO which by the way doesn't have a P A S. BUY NAS """"ILLMATIC"" INSTEAD OF BIG ""READY TO DIE"" CAUSE ALL SONGS OF ILLMATIC ARE CLASSICS"
1,B5 Should Be Gone,"Don't spend your money on this cd. It is so boring I fell asleep during the first song. Their song ""All I Do"" is the worst song I've ever heard. It's the suckiest of all suck songs. My dad heard that song for the first time on the radio and after the first 30 seconds, he changed the station.If I could, I would rate this cd 0 out of 5 stars."
1,Are people actually that deaf,You people are not only sick but obviously ya'll got alot of money to waste buying a B5 cd. The only reason i gave this 1 Star was because i couldn't put zero. Not only are these dudes less than average singers but they following P. Diddy. And aint it funny Diddy is havin a show tryna make stars outta people and this man can't rap to save his life. honestly if somebody really wanna listen to these morons save ur money and listen to it online ok.
2,Hmm....400th review,"I'm giving these boys 2 stars...Sing about more mature stuff, grow up, and get new clothes. I'll give you props for trying and because your decent looking."
3,Boys will be boys...,"I knew I couldn't expect too much from this new edtion to Bad Boy. Being a long time Bad Boy fan, I was hoping from more in this CD, but wasn't satisfied. Diddy's new edition to Bad Boy is nothing more than a teenage girls heartthrob here to serve as an obsession to little girls. What they sing about is nothing more than puppy love and even their beats are lagging. This CD is great if you have a little sister or daughter who's looking for a good crush. It's not so much their music that has gotten them attention, but their looks. While listening to this CD I even questioned if it was their real voices at times because they sounded so off and different. If you haven't bought this CD yet and are on the fence about B5..just still to downloading the tracks, or go burn a friends copy."
5,A Must-Have Album,"I fell in love with B5 only a couple months ago. This R&B; group that ages range from 10-17 don't just have the looks, they also have the talented voices.The first track, ""Let It Be"" is a beautiful acapella that shows you ther outstanding ranges. Although it is a short version, B5 does an excellent remake of this Beatels hit. Some familiar tracks are ""U Got Me"" and their first single ""All I Do"". The album also includes the up-beat danceable song ""Dance 4 U"". This album isn't just straight R&B;, it also has a little pop and definitly rap, provided by the group's rapper Kelly.You will definitly feel the ""brotherly love"" of Dustin, Kelly, Patrick, Carnell, and Bryan Breeding when you get this album. Every track is sensational and I gauruntee you that you will have these loveable songs stuck in your head for a while. You won't take this album out of your CD player for a while."
5,B5 Crazy,I am a supporting Fan of B5 From Patrick To Kelly Dustin to Carnell and even Bryan I love them all and would do anything for them there alubm is off the hook and for anybody that dosent have it needs to get it
5,B5 IS AWESOME!,"I LOVE B5. THEY ARE AWESOME. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE:ALL I DO,YOU GOT ME ,SO PRETTY,AND DANCE 4 YOU.LISTEN TO THEM!"
5,I love it!,"This cd is hot. You might not think that when you first hear it but the more I listened to it the more I became addicted. My fave songs are ""dance for you"" track 3 and ""So pretty"" track 4. I love all of the songs I listen to the cd about 5 times a day and the lyrics are clean so everyone can listen to them. And if you listen to the cd it makes you want to laugh if you listen to what they say in the background.The cd gets me real hype I love dancing to it the beats are hot. The boys are hot to especially Dustin, patrick,carnell,bryan the little cutie, and kelly. I recommend that you get the cd today! Peace."
5,Hot Stuff,This cd shows their talent and it is very inspiring to me that i want to become a perfessional singer. they Should keep on pursueing their career.
5,b5 is soo amazing,ok when i first saw b5 i wondered who they were. when i joined there i-squad. i fell in love with them. they are so hott. and there voices are amazing. i cant wait to see them in concert and everyone should buy there cd cuz its soo awesome. and everyone go see them on the scream 4 tour in a city near you !!!

4,Not your typical RDI,"Carrie Pilby is definitely one of the best books from this genre, and from RDI, come to think of it. Carrie is a complex character, a misfit, in fact, and it's refreshing to have a main character who isn't one of the popular girls all grown up. She is an underdog who we can all relate to in one way or the other and I love how she grew as a person throughout the book.Also, her take on religion was pretty refreshing, adn she handled it perfectly. While she didn't turn Jesus-freak on you, she didn't get take the easy way out and Christian-bash either. I'm not a religious person, but gratuitous Christian-bashing is getting pretty boring and unoriginal.All and all, this was a great read."
5,Carrie Pilby is an aventourous reaD,"I read Carrie Pilby last summer and I connected to it because I was 19 at the time and the book chronicles the everyday life of a 19 yr old(and I could relate to character's life/personality somewhat). Granted, the character is a 'genius' but she really is your average 19 yr old handling life's obstacles(funny and mudane but some are also serious) as they come her way. She deals with the past and present experinces.All in all this book is interesting and realistic. grab it!"
4,A most interesting character and an open road,"I was kind of expecting the superficial, lightweight Red Dress story, the type that you like to read when you had a hard day or on vacation, but this character surprised and fascinated me. The ending is not obvious at all, and the story depicts quite well the feelings of alienation and neuroses of a pretty, really smart and insightful teen who lives in New York. Those who have been through social phobias and inadequacy will definitely relate to Carrie. Bravo! Looking forward to your next novel, hopefully not about Carrie getting engaged and married and living happily ever after."
3,Not the usual Red Dress Ink book...,"Carrie Pilby, as you have probably figured out is a child prodigy. She skipped 3 grades throughout school then graduated from Harvard at 19. It's obvious she's not the typical teenager- in some ways that's good because I wouldn't have normally chosen this book unless it was Red Dress Ink. I didn't like the fact that I was about 1/2 way through the book and I could figure out if I really like it or not. It's not a bad read... I liked how she over-analyzes EVERYTHING (it made me laugh) and I liked listening to her try to understand how to make friends and why she should care about other people. It was ""different"", but not necessarily in a bad way. If you're on the border about buying it, I'd say buy it used or wait for a friend to loan it to you- but do read it. It was definately interesting seeing things from Carrie Pilby's point-of-view, because I'm no where near the prodigy qualifications."
4,Interesting read - more suited to adults than teens,"Although this is a Harlequin Teen book, I think the sophisticated themes in the book make ""Carrie Pilby"" more suited to adults than young teens. Not that there is inappropriate content, but it's not the typical young adult novel.""Carrie Pilby"" wasn't what I expected from a Harlequin Teen novel, and maybe that's why it took me a while to get into the book. However, once I got used to the style of the book, I did find myself rooting for Carrie, who felt she didn't fit in anywhere, to find her identity and start enjoying life. I think most of us can relate to this in some degree and her struggles were realistic.This was an unusual, unique coming of age book that will appeal to college-age and other adult readers."
4,"Smart, funny book","Carry Pilby is an unusual book. If you crave action and plot, this book isn't for you. But it is a great character-driven book. While the reviews call it hilarious, I think that is a bit misleading. I didn't laugh out loud at all, but I did find it to be very amusing. Carrie is a genius, and the way her mind works will make you chuckle, or at least smile. For the author to have written this character, she must be very smart herself.Skipping three grades kept Carrie from being bored and under-challenged in school, but at the same time, it seriously damaged her social skills. She sees a therapist who gives her a to-do list with simple things most people take for granted, like go on a date and join an organization.The plot of the book, if any, is Carrie trying to fulfill the list. By the end she begins to loosen up and realize some things really are shades of gray, not black or white as she always thought.I recommend this for all smart girls who love to read."
4,It reminded me of me,"This book is scaringly on target. I have experienced many of the same problems with the world. Although it bored me in the beginning, after the first chapter or so I really got into it and it was hard to put down. I highly recommend this book to all the social misfits, over achievers, and those who just don't want to get out of bed and face the world. It seems to put things in perspective."
5,The world from Carrie Pilby's eyes,"Carrie Pilby is a 19 years old Harvard-graduate-and really genius-girl. She is good with thinking, memorizing, and problem solving. But really-really bad in socializing.So...living in New York City, she tries to understand the world with her point of view.And through her journey, she meets a lot of interesting characters, such as the leader of new church (which she thought is a cult), a guy who wants to cheat from her fiancee, etc.Carrie learns to see the world from grey area, not just from black/white area.This book is really-really great for people who think that the world is full with hipocryte characters...And of course, for people who love to laugh, think, and cry at the same time...not because Carrie Pilby, but because the world itself.... =)"
4,The cynical yet hilarious outlook of a former child prodige,"Ever look at the world and see it swarming with hypocrits? Ever refuse to tell someone what movie you've rented because if you ever decide to rent a dirty movie you don't want to have to tell them? Or have you ever refused to tell someone what book you are reading because you don't want to have to give them a 10 minute summery? Carrie Pilby, the former child prodige does all of these things. Not to mention requiring to know the IQ of someone before she dates them! If you like a bit of cynical humor this book is really for you, and even if you don't you'll still find this book amusing if not absolutely hilarious. Ah..the wonders of a good book. In this marvelous masterpiece you can get a glimpse through the eyes of a cynical former child prodige who realizes that morals aren't as clear cut as she once thought."
3,"a great start, but not quite sustained","Carrie Pilby is one odd chick. To me, that's a good thing. So I was looking forward to spending some time with the inner life of this 19 year old genius - it was her crazy-but-yet-insightful explanation of why one shouldn't disclose the titles of movies one rents to any old body (the witty beginning of the novel, and I think you can read it on Amazon) that drew me in.So why didn't I love the book? The usual reasons: Carrie's sad and lonely and can't figure out how to make things better and after a while listening to her observations felt more claustrophobic than lapidary. Not implausible, but also not so fun, and it made the end seem more tacked on as a genre requirement than realistically cathartic.One thing that I liked: the book is kind of yay sin. Carrie and her friends sometimes do things they oughtn't, things they might regret, but the book's fair about why they do these things anyway and some of the pleasures, as well as the pains, that come from them."
3,Just ok,"I am not as excited as most of these reviewers. I got the book after reading the amazon reviews and this book was not my favorite, for sure. It really reminded me of Seinfeld - in that it was a book about a bunch of nothing. (I do love Seinfeld....) She questions anything and everything in life. And trying to make sense of the entire world in the eyes of a genius. The relationships she had with a few characters did lead me on to the next page to see what would happen but I was so happy to be done with the book. It was just ok, but I would not recommend it to everyone. It dragged on way too much."
4,Great Read!,I enjoyed this book. It was a fun read for a long airplane ride. I enjoyed the language and the flow of the book.
2,For Glamour magazine readers,"This is the story of a gifted young woman who has nothing to do. She sleeps, mostly, and once a week pulls herself out of bed to visit her therapist. We know she gifted because she tells us so, ad nauseum, but there is little evidence of her giftedness in her thought processes. She is really quite dull. So, she follows her therapist's 5-point-plan to enhance her social life and it more or less works, and she ends up in bed with exactly the man we knew she would from the beginning. Not recommended.I feel this author has promise and can do better than this."
2,Boring and Just Drags On,"I was very much lookng foward to reading this book because of its rave reviews here on Amazon, but once I had it I just couldn't stay with it. As much as I wanted to like Carrie, I just couldn't. There wasn't really much of a plot either. While I did make myself finish it, it never redeemed itself and I was just happy to be finished."
4,Quick fun read,A delightful book about a woman that doesn't quite fit into the world around her. It was fun to read her interpretation of everyday events. A joy to read!
3,A decent read,"This is not a very active or intense drama, mostly a memory play. Although it is well-written, unfortunately, it's not going down as one of my favorites."
3,An earlier version of Franzen's Freedom?,"I read this book a month or so after Freedom, by Franzen. I felt like I was reading the same book. Similar theme, plot and minor characters. Is this a new genre?"
1,Dull and uninspired.,"The Last Good Chance is well written in terms of prose and form, but it is flawed in all other respects. Quite simply, the book is boring, dull, and uninspired. I literally fell asleep repeatedly while trying to get through this banal tale of rural New York."
1,not what i thought it was...,"When i ordered this product, I was under the assumption that it was the most up-to-date ""professor teaches"" series of dvd/cd'. Nowhere in the ad or in the picture is it made clear that this product is from 2002. No complaints about shipping as it was on time; or condition, as it was fine. I wanted this product, as I am trying to get ahead of the administrative curve. Seeing as these training programs are from 2002, I think its pretty obvious that they are of no use to me. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
5,"Exquisite, nectarous brew.","If you're going to sip this lusciously delicious tea you might as well grab your kitty or puppy, a good book, blanket and snuggle up in the favorite armchair because good times are ahead!Having the pleasure of all ready trying out some of the Ahmad teas I was pretty sure this was a good purchase but it ended up being tasty beyond my predictions. This tea tastes like a wonderful black smooth tea with the succulent mouth watering flavors of juicy apricots. I prefer a black tea with fruit blend to herbal fruit teas when I want something soothing because the black tea give the fruit unparallel depth and character.This really bursts with flavor when sugar is added and it can be drank day and night. I'm really looking forward to tasting other Ahmad flavors like Strawberry and passion fruit and maybe their Earl Gray. This is easily one of my favorite teas and I can't see anyone not loving it from the first sip!"
5,It tastes as good as it smells.,This tea has a more distinct apricot flavor than other brands I've tried. I'll be a repeat customer.
1,bad description-what years? models? thy make 5 for toyota,"need better description of product, product part number would be good for a start found out they make five for the toyota. model? years? thinks like thatwill sell on ebay with proper details"
5,Magnificent,"So what else is there to say? The great Emil Jannings, starring with Evelyn Brent and being directed by von Sternberg. The concept is nothing if not unique--the supreme commander of the Russian army meets the Bolshies and is reduced to being a Hollywood actor, working for one of the Bolshies he had arrested who has, by now, become a Hollywood diva/director. The execution is magnificent. The performances are stellar, the lighting utter magic. In silent film the images tell the story and what a story they tell here. Perfectly."
5,What I expect from MBI,"This is an excellent book, with numerous beautiful photos. It covers evything from Avengers to Catalinas, including some seldom heard of aircraft. This is a great book for any WW 2 Navy fan or historian. It is on par with the other exceptional books I've bought from MBI."
4,Transgender Trollop,"Bayba is a transsexual. When we first meet her she is still pre-op and performing as prostitute or sex slave. But Bayba goes through with the operation and decides to enter a contest for b...h of the year.To win the contest Bayba must satisfy more man in twenty-four hours than the previous winner. She will need to handle 110 men. That's just thirteen minutes each. But with regular cigarette breaks and handling more than one at a time on occasion, it looks like Bayba will be able to succeed.This is a strange and kinky tale with Bayba performing very uninhibited acts with all manner of men. The artist seems to be making a statement about the sort of men Bayba encounters as all of them are drawn with pig faces (if you can see their faces). But this is no ordinary dirty book as it dares to venture into areas most will not. The art is clear and in full color. If you liked Casa Howhard this might be up your alley."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I agree with the others who had trouble with the Igloo fridge. I tried to order an $8 part from Curtis International and got nowhere! What a big waste of money! Highly recommend you shop for another brand. No one sells parts for this fridge, including the company who makes it."
1,Complete waste - works fine for a while then bam. nothing.,Completely nice looking shelf with a door on it - that's what I have left. Worked fine for a few weeks... then stopped completely. No warranty support - I'd have to pay to ship it back and forth to have someone examine it to see if they could fix.Never will purchase another Igloo product. I have a completely useless refrigerator in my office now - a stainless steel cabinet with a door on it.
1,Igloo Refrigerator,Refrigerator arrived missing a foot from Amazon. Called Igloo direct to receive front right foot and waited 3 weeks for the part to arrive. Then they sent the wrong part. So still no working refrigerator. Very disappointed. Not an easy item to return since box had to be ripped to get the refrigerator out.Bad marks for Igloo And Amazon!
5,Great textbook on competitive strategy,Excellent textbook on competitive strategy using an economics approach. The first edition complemented my business and economics studies at grad school. Includes a chapter on regulatory (public policy) impacts on business; a topic usually missing from strategy texts. Shows how a 'bill becomes a law' from the business/market perspective !
3,"Not bad, but very much better Encarta Reference Library","ENCARTA STANDARD is not bad, but it is very much better to buy Encarta Reference Library, because it has very much more text, very much more multimedia and very much more features (Atlas and so on). I have reviewed it if you want extra information. The PC system requirements are about the same."
3,This book is what it says it is,"This book is a good addition to other references for the English language. However, it is, primarily, British in tone and in the material included. Also, some American non-sexual but illicit meanings seem to have entirely escaped the authors. Finally, there is a slight tendency toward prissiness in definitions in some areas where an American might give an even blunter definition."
3,Does not include the origins of the sayings,"I mostly wanted this book because I am interested in the origins of euphemisms. Some of them include this information, but most do not."
3,mix 'em up thru speech,"This is a fun book. I like to bandy about some of these phrases and watch the reaction. Words are important and when you use phrases people are not used to hearing, well, you get their attention."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,WHAT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! The product claims to be safe for the classroom. It is not.
2,"Buy the socket tool, not this.",My title says it all. I have both tbis tool and the socket version. My bottom bracket was way to tight for this tool and it was hard to keep this from stripping the groves. The socket is easier to control and put the necessary torque into. The tool itself is fine but was not what I needed.
4,Great Bottom Bracket Tool,This is a professional style bottom bracket wrench for Shimano BBs. Good feel with quality construction. If you are a DIY person this will work great. You do have to pull the crankset in order to use it on the bottom bracket. Pedros version BB wrench that has an open end may be a better match if you do small tune ups and just want to retighten things. The other end works on the crank caps.
4,"Great pot, hard to clean first time","This is great heavy duty pot for a very low price. I've used it so far to cook a pineapple upside down cake on coals and stew. It worked very well, even without the usual camping legs. This made in China pot has many minor pits and defects in the cooking surface but cooks well after two rounds of seasoning.Here are a few minor issues I had with the pot that caused me to give it 4 stars. The lid has a loop handle that is really set up for a lid lifter. Removing the lid with a pot holder is risky, since the lid is so very heavy. The pot comes coated with wax to prevent rusting in shipment. It is very hard to fully get the wax off, requiring several cycles of heating and soapy rinse. The thin wire handles are the only secure way to lift the pot when full but its awkward and painful.The pot is great but the difficulty of the first cleaning has me looking at preseasoned pot for the future."
3,Difficult to clean,"I have to agree with Frank Yee. Extremely difficult to clean. It is coated with wax and I spent 30 minutes scrubbing it with a green ""scratchy"" pad and dish detergent and still could not get all the wax off - it sticks in all of the pores of the metal. So I put it in the oven at 300 degrees and 1 hour later it still smoking. My kids are complaining about the stinky fog in the house and have gone to the basement to escape. If I knew what I now know I would have purchased an American made product and paid a little extra."
4,This is a great cast iron dutch oven.,I purchased this dutch oven to use on my outdoor stove and it works great. Love the fact that it is preseasoned.. I used it with only a quick wipe out. The fry basket leaves a bit to be desired...
4,Great for Cooking Fish,This is a solid product and very easy to use. There was some assembly of the basket that needed to take place but it was very easy to do. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
5,Bayou Dutch Oven,"Ordered this dutch oven for chef son who has come to enjoy cast iron cooking the best, and he especially loved all the Cajun references on the box. Looking forward to getting it seasoned."
1,Bayou Classic 7460 8-1/2-Quart Cast-Iron Dutch Oven and Lid with Perforated Aluminum Basket,"-I appreciate the shipping, it was very quick.-Bayou Classic 7460 8-1/2-Quart Cast-Iron Dutch Oven and Lid with Perforated Aluminum BasketAs you seen the pot in the picture that the lid had crocodile on it which I wanted to get. I sent it back because of the different lid without a crocodile. They sent me the same as the one I sent it back. I don't have time to send this last one again and I was very very disappointed to buy something online with this bayou Classic company. The pots have the same name and reference number , but the pot I got is different than the one I saw in the picture."
5,Don't let the price fool you - just as good as Lodge!,"What's a camping trip without peach cobbler fresh from a cast iron Dutch oven? Last year when we wanted to take our daughter on her first camping trip, we knew we had to find a cast iron Dutch oven - but the prices were through the roof - especially with shipping included. This one was not only a great price, but with free shipping through Amazon, it was a steal (in fact, I'd guess this has to be one of those items Amazon loses money on bc of the shipping...). The quality is comparable with Lodge and we've got no complaints. We don't plan on frying in it, so I use the aluminum fry basket in my automotive parts washer :-)"
5,My Gumbo Pot,"This Dutch Oven is nice, large and extremely heavy. It's great for stews and gumbos. Haven't tried for frying, though. I love the way it conducts heat."
3,Somewhat satisfied,"When I received the lens, it appeared to be made well. it fit on my Canon Vixia HF10 well. the only problem was that the clarity isn't real good at full zoom.You need to zoom about 60% before you get a full view."
4,Struggles,"I have to admit, this book grabs you. You're thrown into this 49 year olds battles with herself and those around her. The plot development was slow, but only being 14 myself, it was a satisfying read. Her struggles are expressed through a series of events throughout her relationship with this ""boy"" which tests her sanity as she matures into middle age."
5,Julie Hecht is brilliant.,"This is a hilarious, harrowing, immensely moving novel from an essential writer. I highly recommend it."
1,"Should be titled ""Snobbery, Neurosis, and Intolerance""","I was excited to read this book after reading the glowing reviews and after starting it, found myself hooked immediately. However, it soon became obvious that this was a rambling mess and ultimately I put it down and will not pick it up again. The narrator is a neurotic woman who seems to intensely dislike meat-eaters, poor people, and - most importantly - herself. She uses so many affectations in the book that it quickly becomes annoying and distracting. Referring to 9-11 as the ""event of September"" and not giving the boy a name. How aggravating. She is repulsed by people who are not skinny, rich, and vegan. What I want to say to this woman is ""get over yourself.""The story seems to have no flow, no plot, no point. It meanders through the neurotic life of a woman who has way too much money and time on her hands.I did not like this book one bit."
2,Why Won't This Woman Quit Whining?,"I really enjoyed the quality of the writing, but the more I read the more aggravated by ""the boy"" and the narrator I became. My sympathy for their respective psychological plights dissipated as their snobbism, materialism, and self absorbtion took over what I was reading. Taking vegetables out of a lower refrigerator drawer makes her feel like a scullery maid? She calls herself a child of the 60's not into money, yet judges her shrink by her non designer clothes. Others have praised the humor of this novel. I guess I missed it."
1,"Excited at first, then lost interest completely","Having grown up on Long Island and Nantucket, I was excited to see a first novel set in such familiar surroundings. I am interested in the topic of drugs, both legal and illegal, and my expectations were very high as the novel began.After twenty pages I started to wonder where this novel was going, and then I found myself speed-reading to see if there was any developing story, and then I lost interest altogether. I almost never completely lose interest in a novel, especially one that is so promising to begin with, but this novel was dreadful. The protagonist is overbearingly anal and whiny and the story goes absolutely nowhere...it is though we are reading a diary, and a diary of a life that is simply rather boring and full of anxiety about anxiety. Five yawns to this one....."
2,There's Much Better Out There,"It was an ""ok"" book. I found myself at different times very interested, however I also found myself getting bored with it alot. Theres too much bouncing around from ""past"" to ""present"" from one chapter to another instead of keeping an even flow and holding the reader's suspense. One thing I was very annoyed with was the extreme need the author had to keep inanely repeating himself. Once he explained the when, how's and why's Gerry Gallego had changed his name to Steven Feil..there was no need to keep referring to Gerry Gallego EVERY time as ""Gerry Gallego aka Steven Feil..."" I think after all that overly detailed description of how he assumed that name, the reader is smart enough to figure out who the writer is referring to. I felt it was an 'ok' book...but not one drop of suspense to it."
2,Not worth the money,"I actually bought the kindle version of this book, and completely by accident. This isn't to say I would not have as soon grabbed it as a library or whatever else, it's just amazon's 'oneclick' thing. Anyway, I read the book, and it was one of the poorest examples of true crime writing that I've read. The book is *very* short, repetitive in terms of language, has a couple of spelling errors... You keep hoping it will get better or more compelling (one would think the nature of the crimes and criminal team in this book would make the story interesting to read) and it just reads incredibly flatly. If you read about the first few victims, which are presented in the first fifth of the book, you have basically read the entire book; other than a light summary of the trial and some changed-around names, this reads like a tenth grade essay of stretching poorly understood material into however many pages."
1,waste of time,"Where to begin.....first of all the print is large and there are a lot of chapters so there are a lot of blank pages. Must have been the publishers way of making the book apprear to be longer than it is. Secondly the author repeats himself, well, repeatedly. He uses the same phrases over and over. Again a ploy to make the book longer. If the editor and publisher had done their jobs this book would have been only half as long. Also, the writing is dry and unimaginative. This story could have been much more interesting if he had taken the time to flesh out (pardon the pun) the characters, their deeds and the storyline itself. I found that I had to stop myself from skipping pages as I was bored with the pace of the book. I've read much better. Hopefully the author will improve with experience."
2,Writer has to much his own opinion,"Hai (dont mind my English cause I'm from Holland)I,m sorry I bought this book cause I dont think this is a very good one.I was very irritated by the writer finding excuses all the time for the wife of Gallego.It made me very angry.She Charlene Gallego lured the innocent victims in a trap,(in the back of a van,asking them if they wanna smoke some marihuana) knowing what her husband was planning to do to them. and Mr Flowers is writing how quilty she felt and that she could not do anything else,had no other options!!How does he know?And then on the end of the book he suddenly changes his mind?Dont buy this one. There are much better books than this one..."
1,Didn't read in one sitting,"Because I couldn't make heads nor tales out of it. I totally didn't get this book, made no sense, it wasn't entertaining or witty. Geez, I'd rather have just donated directly to Alzheimers than to have purchased this hodgepodge of crap."
2,Good quality but poor finish and construction.,"Love the design, and the wood quality is good. The finish is darker than it appears in the picture, and there is a place on the top where the stain didn't take. Worse, when we put it together we discovered that one of the four dowels wouldn't fit its hole, and that the dowel hole had been mixed up with the screw hole. So we had to drill. And then the screw split the wood on the shelf below. Not too noticeable, but irritating and makes the table less sturdy and subject to further breakdown. All in all, I wish I'd returned it, but it's really heavy and already put together. So it's off to the kids' playroom."
4,THIS IS THE BOOK TO READ IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN GHOSTS!,This is a very informitive book. I love the stories about the railroad tracks. I loved it so much that before I moved away from San Antonio I just had to try it out.
4,Exciting and very interesting,"Living in Texas made this book much more exciting for me, however, I think it will interest others outside of the Lone Star State as well. The book gives as much detail as possible, while telling the stories that were told to the author. There are some pictures, and those in the San Antonio area should be able to locate many of the locations with just the information in the book. The historical information, including the information about who the ghosts are believed to be at each location, add even more excitement to this already mysterious and intriguing topic. Do I believe in ghosts? I don't think so, but it's still fun to read about others imagination - or maybe their experiences ---- how would I know? Nevertheless, give it a try - especially if you are in Texas - and most definitely if you are in or near San Antonio! I think you'll enjoy it!"
1,WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!,"It's like a ghetto ""Girl's Gone Wild"" - really cheap. So I got the Vol. 2 . . . it's the same stuff. Looks like it was shot the same day with the same ugly girls and there's not really any nudity at all!! The Naked Games with no nudity?! Something is wrong here! I feel ripped off!!"
4,Love This!,"I bought two tv themes CDs, and am enjoying them both. This one has more theme songs I don't recognize (shows I never watched), but it's still fun to listen to!!"
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY...,These themes are all fakes and are not the Originals.You can get the real thing from TVT Records so buy them .This is a piece of garbage and a slap in the real collectors face.
3,nostaglic,used on west coast trip to see who remembered the shows associated w/ the themes. lots of fun to hear.
2,disappointing,It was described OK but the songs are short and sound quality is varied. I won't be listening to these discs much.
1,Huge Dissapointment,"I was very dissapointed with the 2 dvd set I bought on 100 tv themes. they were originals allright, but the songs were just quick soundbytes. they werent full length. The cheers theme is over 2 1/2 minutes long. In this set its only a minute long. Hill st blues the same thing. Good times theme has been reduced to .44 seconds as was mary tyler moore, and many others. They should have made this a 3-4 cd set and included all the songs full length. I never would have bought this had I known they only included 25% of the song length. No one mentioned this on the reviews, I am the only one bringing up this major , major , shortcoming."
3,all-time top 100 tv themes,"I found the quility to great on all the tmemes that I liked, but the I found that the tracks on the second cd did not display correctly on my computer system when playing the cd."
3,television theme songs,"For some reason, I thought that the tv theme songs would play in their entirety on these CDs. I did not realize that they were the shortened versions designed for tv, i.e., the abbreviated ones we all remember. That being said, the CDs are great for what they are - they are simply not what i had hoped."
4,Lots of fun,Listening to these CD's brought back some fond memories of childhood. The quality of the tracks were very good. Simply a lot of fun to listen to!
4,All-Time Top 100 TV Themes: A Blast from the Past!,"Overall, this was a pretty good CD. It brought back many memories. However, I noticed that several of the songs were shorter than I remembered them. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the good ole days."
3,murder by night,"This movie has everything. A man loses his memory, there's a serial killer and even some love interest.I found it entertaining."
5,Only one song missing...,"I have searched and searched for the Honey Horn man's version of ""Mae"". This CD is outstanding, but I will never stop looking for one with ""Mae"" on it...the most romantic and beautiful song he ever played. I was sure it was on one of those original LPs...how could it have been omitted??"
4,This is BLEEDING art TISSUE PAPER ... NOT good for GIFT BAGS!,"I purchased this same paper in the larger-sized version (20 x 30 Art Tissue Paper (100 sheets)). This is nice, good quality ART, BLEEDING tissue paper. (""Bleeding"" means that the color transfers easily. If the paper gets wet from water (or sweat), it gets all over/stains your hands.) If that's what you want/need it for, then it is perfect. There are LOTS of shades of very nice BRIGHT and PALE colors. If you are looking for nice gift bag/wrapping paper, this is NOT it. There is a nice variety of various shades of colors, and while they look pretty, they also can/do stain."
1,Colorful Tissue Paper,"You asked me 3 separate questions, but they were each one about a ""toy"". It's not a TOY, it's TISSUE PAPER.It is what I wanted."
3,"Well,....","why the F*** this mediocre flick is titeled 'Day Of The Dead 3' in my country is everybody's guess. Maybe it's because it's as 'good' as the quasi-remake or the unofficial sequel. Evilution is sometimes okay, sometimes unbelievably stupid... which justifies for me a 3 star-review. There've been a lot worse Zombie-flicks out there lately (Zombie Diaries 2 for example or Silent Night Zombie Night), but if you want quality gut-munching stick with the original Day Of The Dead. Cheers."
1,terrible,yet another zombie/infected movie looks like this version they took a cue from that turd of a re-make Day Of The Dead apparently when you're infected you become a gymnast???!!! truly un-original and stupid avoid this piece of crap like the plague(no pun intended)
4,good trance,"As a tranceophile, this was a wonderful CD. Share with me all of the good feelings that trance expouses. get it"
4,Bought it again!,"Purchased this watch to replace the one I lost. I love the design and it kept water out when it got wet. Unfortunately, the clasp caught on something and eventually came undone. Sometimes hard to tell the exact time without numbers on the face...but I love the simplicity of the look."
3,Eden Fruit & Nut Mix,"This mix was okay, but not as good as the Wild Oats brand which used to be available on Amazon. All in all the taste and variety was fine but not exceptional."
5,Great shoes at a great price,"If you know Bostonian shoes then you will know that Amazon.com offers some great prices for them. If you don't know Bostonian brand shoes then I can tell you that they are well made, stylish (office) shoes that represent reasonable value for money."
4,Beautiful Guide as a Second Book,"This book is simply stunning in design, and contains a wealth of background information combined with useful and lush illustrations. It's not particularly well-designed to provide hotel or resturant information, or practical travel advice. On the other hand, it will go out of date perhaps once each century."
3,Beautiful but dated travel guide,"The Paris guide book is a visually stunning travel guide but its themes are dated, evoking a pre-war Paris of writers and painters and strolls along the Champs Elysees, when today Paris is a much more consumer-based society with all the trappings of American cities. We managed to find an affordable hotel with Parisian charm but with little thanks to this book. The maps are little more than cryptic diagrams, making it difficult to find the enticing restaurants the guide lists. Much of the information needs to be updated to serve as a true guide book. Knopf Guide Paris, like the other books in this series, are richly illustrated and give you interesting historic insights into the city but will only disappoint you if you rely on them to circumnvaigate the city."
5,Must Have Book,"The trouble with most travel books is that if you don't have the most recent edition, the information is probably out of date. The beauty of this book on Paris is that there is information on the culture, the cuisine, the history, the art, with a small, very small section on hotels and restaurants. This is not just a great book to prepare you for your trip to Paris, this is a book for a student of the city."
5,Like Going There Again-Superb,"In 1987 I visited paris for the first time. When I purchased this guide it was like going there many times over. It is truely one of the best books I have ever purchased. It is an art guide, history book, architecture study, travel guide and more.What more could there be? This is an excellent reference all around. Its easy to research a novel from this tome alone. I felt that I stepped off a plane and had an excellent english speaking tour guide with me.I naturally proceeded to get the rest of the set of travel guides. It was better than all the encyclopedias I had in school. The benefit of this series is that unless the world changes dramatically, the travel guides will not go out of style of years to come."
2,"Good plot, however, disappointing ending.","The concept of the book is terrific, however, I found the writing to be too amateurish and at times a bit too slow---even though the book is only 223 pages! The ending disappointed me because I felt it was a bit of a cop-out. I'm sorry to say, but I would not recommend this book to anyone else."
4,A good read,I thought this book was really good. It's really believable how someone is completely ashamed of their heritage. I finished this book in a few hours. Gloria Mallette is my favorite author and she never ceases to amaze me with her writing.
3,Average at Best,"I suppose I have an inbred bias toward this book because I didn't care for the corresponding class for which it was originally purchased. In any case, I have always had a problem with books that only stress the empowerment approach and the strengths perspective as the only form of treatment. I didn't like this text because I don't feel focusing on one technique qualifies as a ""generalist approach,"" regardless of how well you can simultaneously juggle micro and macro level issues.In addition, the book reads like a primer. It is relentlessly generalist in its explanation of things. Some complex issues are only given a brief paragraph-long description. I think it is a good book for someone who has absolutely no idea what social workers do. Those who are looking to mature their skills should skip this book and opt for something more in depth."
3,Informative textbook,"Its a very informative textbook. Great for second year Social Work students. Gave a three star because...well, i'm not to fond of school, and because it's just another textbook."
5,SO happy I found this!!,"I've already seen this movie before when I was younger, but I couldn't ever find it anywhere. Until I got an amazon account! Now I have the movie and I've already watched it four times since Christmas! I am SO happy that the search for this movie has come to an end :D Thank You!"
4,Beautiful voice and music,"Jai Uttal has a beautiful voice, the music is a great synthesis of east and west; probably a wee bit too much west, but I'm splitting hairs. This person exemplifies what I personally consider to be one of life's great joys.... having a professional (at whatever), who is genuinely into what they do, do what they do for you.Anyway, he's good. And obviously a happy person, which is an added bonus that comes out in his music. Sheesh, there are so many unhappy people in this world, that the really happy ones tend to stick out. And *I'm* very glad to have Jai Uttal's music in my collection. Yup, pretty HAPPY. ;->"
5,surreal,Jai Uttal along with Krishna Das present music to balance the world.Any person remotely aligned with world peace / yoga or betterment of the world will relate to the mystical chants and attitude expressed here.This album should be compulsory for all liked minds.Wonderful !
4,Music for Yoga,"Beautiful instrumentals... My favorite is the second track. The other tracks are all musically alive and interesting, but I had hoped for more vocals. Great for practicing yoga or for meditating."
3,"Very good, But ...","The instrumental music is fantastic, Jai Uttal's chanting really detracts from the album. It's as if it doesnt really fit into the music. If one could edit the annoying chanting off it would be a 5 star album."
4,"Good product, great memories","I recommend this set to anyone who remembers the Rainbow Brite specials and wants to own them. From research, it looks to me as if this set was released in Canada and possibly for a brief time in the US. These appear to be legitimately licensed products, so don't be afraid of ordering. :) Mine arrived in great condition, and while there are sound issues (the volume on the episodes is much lower than on the disc menu), the transfer is very good. Some of the episodes have a grainy quality reminiscent of their TV origin, but who can complain when you have *Rainbow Brite* on your DVD player? Overall, these are excellent DVDs and, if you loved Rainbow Brite as much as I did as a child, you'll like having the specials all on DVD for yourself. Enjoy!"
2,THIS SELLER WANTS $200??!!!,"The 2 stars I am giving is NOT because I don't like Rainbow Brite, I LOVED THAT SHOW. No the 2 stars are for this: WHY IS THIS DVD SET $200? Seriously, there's no description of episodes, is the quality good? She-Ra was re-released as well as other 80's cartoons and was remastered. $200 and you can't tell me why? Are there extra features? Is this official? Ebay has this (but its not regional to America/Canada) for $20 and its the same 2 disc set. WHY IS THIS $200? Seriously can someone please tell me?"
3,The Charles Chaplin Review,I thought that this collection was very good. It really amazes you to watch some of his work from the silent film era. Because back then it was all about how good your facial & body expressions were. While nowadays people are more concerned with their voice.So i must give great credit to CHarles Chaplin for doing what he did so greatly in the silent film era.
4,Don't Count Leslie Uggams out,"This release of two best selling (at the time) albums by Leslie came at a time when everyone was Singing Along With Mitch. The whole sing a long gang is there which at times can be annoying. Leslie's voice was mature at a very early age and her understanding of the material was uncanny for her age. The first album was recorded when she was 18 and the second one when she was 21. As a bonus, the last song, One More Sunrise (Morgan)was added originally released only as a single. Now I wish they would release her beautiful album So In Love which gets rid of the singers and adds the lush string arrangements of Glenn Osser."
5,Olaf Bär: Lieder,Olaf Bär: Lieder is a 1997 EMI Classics recording starring barytone Olf Bar and pianist Helmut Deutsch.Richard Wigmore has written the music notes. All the lyrics are included. When hearing a German singer sing in German you feel that they perfectly understand the language. The various nuances and can play more with the language then a foreigner. Olaf Bar sings with great feeling and conviction. Truly a great performance. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
2,1 dimentional Unlike His Older Releases With Paul Brown,"Boney used to be the man, but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should listen to his older stuff like Seduction, Trust, or Backbone. You will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential. Cmon'Boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of. Peace!"
4,Christain jazz fan,"I have several CDs by Boney James,I like his work alot. I amtruly a jazz fan. I am also a dedicated christain. Recentlysomeone told me about amazon.com so my enjoyment and will be tolisten to and purchase the afore mentioned music that I like somuch."
3,Not My Favorite Boney James CD,"I am a huge Boney James fan but I'll have to respectfully disagree with the strong reviews given by others for this CD. In my opinion, Ride was a much better piece of work. The highlights are certainly Stone Groove with Joe Sample and Appreciate with Debi Nova (she can really sing - I loved this tune). The low point for me was Better With Time featuring Bilal. I really liked this song a lot but the singing was just flat out bad. I kept asking myself how a musician like Boney James could allow someone to sing on his CD who was off key as much as Bilal was on this tune. Overall, the CD just didn't inspire me the way Boney James' CD's normally do - to play it over and over again."
5,WOW,"all i can say is wow what a record. His ninth could be his best one yet.I have been a fan of his for a while and this is his smoothest album yet. i was at a concert of his a month or so back and he just blew me away. i am truly empressed with this album and in my thinking he should at the very least be nominated again for another grammy if not win one! this is ""Pure"" smoothjazz and R&B at its best"
3,Good Melodies but lacks the Depth,"Boney is the BEST wind instrumentalist I have ever heard play and a lot of people will agree with me. Any Symphony Orchestra won't hesitate to have him in its esemble. The problem here is that his fans had been accustomed with his style from earlier recordings which I believe should not have changed. People should take note of the UK group SADE in this regard. Change your style and its back to square one.Pity !!, but I will stay loyal. Brilliant musician nonetheless"
3,season 6 episode 6,"Come on....let's see real evidence. Not garble turned into words. How come normal people see full appericians, but with all you've done we get a shadow"
5,"Light, lively, and entertaining - unique!","The world created by Glen Cook is a one-of-a-kind fantasy world and his talent for ""real-life"" characters is engaging; the result is a fun series of books you can thoroughly enjoy between the more weighty fantasy offerings!"
5,Love this book,All of the Garret books are great. Glen Cook has a real gift for making interesting stories with interesting characters. I am always sorry when the stories end!
4,Glen Cook at his best,"I have read several books by this author and he very rarely lets you down. Because this is the beginning of the adventures of Garrett I may have been expecting more. This is however a great introduction to the characters and makes you want to find out what else happens in the world of this human PI dealing with centaurs, faeries, demons and the such. Sweet Silver Blues introduces a world where anything can and often does happen. If you want to escape into another world that so closely resembles our own, I would recommend this and the rest of his adventures."
4,_The Apogee_ is a true summary of this work,"This is amongst the best histories of a great civilization I've yet to read. Concise, with enough amusing anecdotes to give the reader a sense of delving into the material, the author has put together a wonderful, easily read work. It has the skills and enjoyability of a Tuchman book. It is highly recommendable to those seeking an initial historical overview of the Eastern Roman Empire at the peak of its curve."
5,Excellent Story and Wll Written,I have read all three of the volumes in this set. Norwich maintained the same high level of story telling and descriptive detail throughout. Others may groan at the idea of 1000+ pages on the Byzantine Empire. It is their loss.
4,Good Read,"The author is not a professional historian. He does not know how to read the sources critically and is unable to select and reject the secondary literature, but he has a beautiful style, and if you're not too concerned with historical accuracy, it is a pleasing introduction to a fascinating subject. DOWN WITH GIBBON!"
5,Superlatives Won&#65533;t Do,"The 3 volumes of this series are, without a doubt, the best non-fiction books I have ever read. The author makes wondrously clear a twisted and brutal story, entertaining to such an extent one forgets he is reading history, and yet leaving the reader feeling as though he lived through it all. Admittedly, some credit must go to Byzantium itself, the history of which is fascinating; with more murders, plot twists, and intrigues than Hollywood's best could create in a year. Many an author, however, have stumbled over the same events with appreciably less ability for storytelling. Only the limitations of my own writing constrain my ability to convey how excellent this book is, not to mention his others, which I am now collecting. 200 years from now historians will be asking themselves what I am already wondering: where can I get a signed copy?"
4,HAIL TO THE BYZANTINES!,"This book, as many reviewers have pointed out, is part II of a trilogy and sequel to ""Byzantium The Early Centuries"". You don't really need to read the first book to follow this one, but you will certainly enjoy it much more if you read ""The Early Centuries"" first. In this volume you'll encounter many interesting characters: Emperors, Patriarchs of the Eastern Church, able generals, usurpers, debauchees and good-for-nothing bums. (In fact, some of them fall into two or more of the previous categories!). In my opinion, the story of Emperor Basil II alone is worth the price of this second volume. If you haven't read the first volume of this series and want to know about Byzantine History, consider taking advantage of Amazon's offer and get both volumes. You won't be disappointed."
1,Picture is Better than Item Itself,"Tiffany-Style Mission Table LampThis product was not as nice as I expected. We had ordered two. The light bulbs blew out immediately. The leading between the glass is slightly sloppy. I would recommend for this type of item, purchase it in a store where you can examine the quality, and is easier to return if there is a problem. I guess you get what you pay for -- the cheaper the cost, the cheaper the quality of the item."
2,I love the look but..,"Ok I have owned two of these but not at the same time. I had to buy a second to replace the first one after about two and a half years- A part broke and I liked the look so much I thought I just had bad luck... Now two and a half years later, I am sad to report that something is loose in the wiring and it pops on and off without provocation. As pretty as it is, it is really cheap construction."
3,Ahmad Tea Blackcurrant Burst,"Prefer Ahmad's plain Blackcurrant tea. The ""Burst"" does not have much of a blackcurrant flavor. Please consider selling Blackcurrant tea in bulk form, i.e. NOT in tea bags."
2,"no flavor, disappointed","not near the black current flavor i was hoping for, a cafe i go to has wonderful black current tea, was hoping to be able to make it at home, tried the Ahmed brand, no flavor, tastes just like black tea. i will try another brand"
5,Ahmad is an excellent tea,"I don't drink American teas so I special order them about once a year. I never tasted this brand before unlike teas made in the US you can actually smell the black current or black cherry aroma, as it's called in the United States. it's a rich great tasting tea and an excellent brand.Ahmad Tea Blackcurrant Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)I intend to buy it again.The price was very reasonable and it helps that it qualified for no shipping"
2,Really disappointing,This tea was a real disappointment. I really disliked the taste. I tried it hot and iced....yuck! I got little or no black currant flavor and in general am not happy with the Ahmad tea line.
4,Pretty sweet,Holds my .40 VE real tight but not so tight you can't get it out. Worth the money. I also bought the 2 clip holster.
5,Excellent fit,"Excellent product...this one really works well, fits my pistol like a glove and is easy to access when on my belt. I highly recommend this...it is well made as well."
4,Magizine release problem.,"I like this item. Fit's good and was priced right.The only problem I have is you have to draw it out quik in order for it to work right, no big deal, I like that, but some times it will release the magazine and that could be a problem in a real situation.It might be I need to pratice with it more."
1,Looks can be deceiving.,"The Fobus HK1RP Roto RH Holster looks good in a picture, but is a-little different once you receive it, for example: #1. The total width of the holster is a hard 2 3/4"" so it really protrudes out from your hip, not a concealable holster at all, anyone can see it. #2. Not an easy holster to get on and off your belt at all, so if you're looking for a fast clip and go, look elsewhere. #3. If you like where the holster sets in the loops of your belt now, don't expect that with this holster, this one unquestionably sets high."
5,POP PUNK AT ITS BEST,"This album starts of with a bang and takes that initial energy and blows through the entire disc. Right from the opening lines of ""Feeble"", this energetic So-Cal punk band rocks through all 45 or so minutes of this album. My favorite songs are the aforementioned ""Feeble"", another love song ""Cliche"", along with ""Last"" and the incredibly political ""By What Right"". Tooth and Nail has found a wonderful punk band through Slick Shoes."
4,good instrumentals,"Overall i like this Cd, they guitar and drums sound really good when you listen to just them. But the vocals are kind of off i think, they kind of blare and it sounds like his mouth is like wide open the entire time or something. But the songs are still nice, and i'd recommend buying it."
1,Falsifying Information,"What they are selling here is false. It is the exact item as shown in the picture, however the information is not correct. This post calls this item Anti-Fungal Treatment for nails and surrounding areas, but it is not. The box shipped quotes ""For skin under and surrounding nails"" - if not viewed carefully, this can be misunderstood. The one for nails is a different packaging and item. Do NOT purchase this if you are looking to cure something on top of a nail as this does not do that; it just cures the skin and surrounding areas. Look at what is quoted on the back of the box in the picture: ""This product is not effective on scalp or nails"".So, it would be very helpful if they mentioned that in the description or at least changed the title... or BOTH! I'm severely put-out by this and will return this item asap. *NOTE* Thursday Plantation does actually make a product that cures fungus on top of a nail, and it is not this product."
4,Ghosts and history,"I love Most Haunted, and I wish that Antix/Living TV would release more DVDs formated for the US/Canada. They are in the 10th season in England but only some of the episodes from their earlier seasons are on this set. I love what Most Haunted does and the history about the locations is great. Whether they catch ghostly activity or not is hit and miss as one might expect it to be with only 24hours at each site. Some of the episodes are not very exciting while others are great. I am not as impressed with the Medium on these episodes. He is a bit over dramatic for my taste. All in all I find it very enjoyable and hope that they release more episodes."
1,Why did I buy this?,I usually like this kind of stuff but I wasn't to smart when I bought it despite the bad reviews.
2,disappointing,just the timing and feel of the show just kind of bored. we didnt even watch the whole thing. It was very British.
3,DVD discs,One of the discs wouldn't work even after several attempts to do so. The quality of those that do work is excellent
2,Workmanship lacks,"Although it is a beautiful watch, it could have been constructed to last better. The small rivets that hold the individual leather pieces on are thin and those pieces come off the rivets easily. This happened fairly early into my ownership of the watch. I now have a entire leather patch missing and one ready to come off. Also the buttons blend to well with each other and are too recessed. Sometimes if you are in a hurry you can press the wrong one by mistake.Aside from those two things its a nice watch which fits well. Of course the look degrades more and more as you loose rivets and the leather pieces they are holding..."
5,Form over Function,"I received this as a gift from my boyfriend's parents and ohhh, I love it! The wrist clasp mechanism is easily adjustable, setting time and date is fairly intuitive (for those who are familliar with digital watches, anyhow), and I think it's just a very good looking watch to begin with (the main draw, after all). Sure, it's a men's watch but who doesn't like leather? ;)I will agree that the backlighting tends to be a little on the weak side so if you expect to spend a fair amount of time in poorly lit conditions, you might not find that to be helpful. Aside from that, I have no real complaints about this watch.It's nothing fancy, it tells the time and day, and it looks fantastic. Great gift for those who don't care if this watch may not be one James Bond's first choice."
4,Diesel Watch,"This watch is a super stylish and comfortable! The only downside is that the buttons on the side are really close together so when you want to push ""light"" for the background light, you can accidentally push ""time"" and change the time. It would be better if there was a time lock but other than that it is one of the coolest watches I have ever seen!"
5,An amazing experience through the sound of trance.,The rare and breath taking sounds of the Bonzai label are compiled on a three cd set.That sucks you into a deep vortex of unparralelled euphoria.
1,Disapointing,"I bought this cd like every other bonzai compilation before it, hoping it would be as good as the others were. Unfortunately this is not the case. It was realy disapointing to hear the compilation on this cd. Some of the tracks wern't even released on the bonzai label. This is realy anoying if you think you are buying a NEW bonzai cd.I hope the next cd is either better or won't be released at all. I used to like Bonzai records, but if this is the tone for the future, they won't have my support."
4,Long Battle...BUT Great,I've seen almost all of shaman king in Japanese and to tell you the truth this was the longest fight. Sure it's good but i didn't find it to have to take up much time. Soon after this it gets funny and then we learn a little about Ren's past and present. Well enjoy this volume and a good fight and then enjoy the next one or two as a good story and some nice fighting.Also for the below reviewer no it doesn't follow the dragonball z where fights take forever. This is one of the longest fights in the series.
1,No Stars; I had to check one star to publish-but NO STARS,"Don't even bother. No stars. They don't even understand the play. I would have preferred Mel Brooks as the husband and Barbra Streisand as Hedda in a musical comedy version over this. Get the Ingrid Bergman performance or rent both and compare the scene where Hedda burns the novel. Then howl with laughter or pity poor Diana Rigg..maybe it was the director's fault, but really, Diana, did you even read the play or understand Ibsen(?). Out of their depth in every way. The male actors as well; they act like fops or her brothers rather than passionate lovers. Simply AWFUL!"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Nitro Praise 4 is GREAT (with a gazillion exclamation marks)! I totally love it. I listen to it while working out, cleaning, at work, when I need a pick-me-up and it's too late for coffee. The songs are worshipful, catchy, easy to sing along with, fun, inspiring and a must-own for any Christian."
5,great dipiction of a hard to find animal,"My almost 5 year old is very interested in arctic animals right now. Why? Search me. This is the same kid who spent all winter proclaiming that she hates the cold and the wind. Anyway, she's learned about arctic foxes from our numerous books about the arctic, but arctic fox toys are hard to find. Polar bears are everywhere, but not the arctic fox. So when I saw this arctic fox, I ordered it, and my daughter was ecstatic. My only complaint is that I wish it were a bit smaller. We have the Schleich polar bear, and this is probably half the size of that - or maybe a bit bigger than half size. Arctic foxes are much smaller than polar bears. Of course, this model isn't a Schleich animal, so it's on a different scale, I guess. But nonetheless, I wish is was more compatible with the Schleich animals we have."
5,If you only read one war book -- make it 3 -- this trilogy!,"This is #2 of the Pat Barker trilogy about World War I, and this second book is as important as anything you're going to read about war in this challenging season (fall '01). She looks at the inner workings of fear, prejudice and scapegoating -- in the case of WWI Britain, homosexuals and pacificists. Scapegoating is alive and well in America right now, as we look for someone to blame, or someone on whom to take out our tensions. All too often it looks like the ""someone"" is a fellow American with whom we disagree. Read this book, for a deeper understanding of the stresses and strains of war -- on soldiers, yes, but also on us all."
4,The inkologist`s bible !,A broad yet relatively complete technical foray into the specialized domain of printing inks. For inkies I find this book is most useful to shore up on ink types you are not most familiar with. Not too technical. A must for those involved in formulating inks.
4,Wakame seaweed very good and healthy,"This seaweed is very health for blood pressure and cancer prevention. You can soak it 15 minutes and it makes a huge amount. I made a seaweed salad with sesame oil, sesame seeds, minced raw ginger and garlic.When you first make it it smells a little bit ""funky"" like the shore line. My girlfriend could not eat it at first and I had to eat it more for the benefits than the flavor. Overnight it marinated and the next morning was great! I now eat it regularly and it tastes great after 12-24 hrs in the dressing."
2,Seaweed,Like everyone else who has reviewed this product we had the same issue. The product that was still in the bag was good but the bags all had split open and the content of the bags was all over the shipping box. Almost to the point that it looked like they were opened and dumped into the box. Should have trusted the reviews!
3,pretty good,"this wakame is pretty good stuff and easy to use. shipping was quite expensive for me, however, even though the product is very light..."
3,Pleasant reworking of popular standards,I came across Whalin' by the Niclear Whales Saxaphone Orchestra while searching for another cd. I vaguely remembered them from the '80's so on a lark I purchased the cd. What a pleasant suprise. The music is easy to listen to with just a jazz feel to it. The cd is great for traveling in the car or as backround music.
3,Great songs - indifferent sound quality,"Tell me you know of a more talented singer-songwriter and i'll suggest you have been drinking!The album comprises R&B classics (No other version of 'Since I Met You Baby' comes anywhere close to the perfection of Joe's original) and classic ballads (I'll Take You Home again, Kathleen etc) and represents excellent value. The dissapointment for me is the mastering. Problem is, it will always come out second best to the likes of the ACE label.Anyhow, let's place this artist where he deserves to be - At the top!"
4,"Good, well-made USB mic","This mic seemed very well made and capable, but in the end it didn't suit my needs. I returned it and bought the Samson G track, which seemed more capable of over-dubbing and other tasks I had in mind. But the Samson products seemed to be of good quality."
4,Great sounding mic.,"I mostly bought this for voice chatting with friends and gaming, the sound quality of this mic is crystal clear from a distance away, so put on your favorite headphone and don't worry about mic adjustment in the middle of a match.The only thing I didn't like, was the software that came with it, it's buggy and will crash your system, even the latest version of the software is buggy, so stick with the built in windows drivers and it'll work perfect."
4,"For the price I paid, I'm more than happy with this workhorse of a mic.","I paid 90.00 for this mic on Amazon, and for that price I give it at least 4 stars. Sure there are better mics, but not for that price. It provides the right options, the right sound, and the right durability for constant use in studio, or on the go.I'm not worried at all about throwing the mic around in my studio. I've been using it for a couple of months to record and I haven't had any problems with it. (I wanted to wait until I had more experience with it before I gave it a review.)It picks up a lot of bass, even with the bass cut off turned on. This is great for certain kinds of recording.If you go to the Samson website you can listen to an example of some vocal audio recorded on this mic.This is a great mic for someone getting started."
4,Quality,"Its not bad for a non expensive microphone, it has really good quality and also a great prise, not bad at all"
4,Foolscap is a seriously funny madcap adventure.,"Radical college campus protests. Musical theatre.North Carolina. Fraudulent Elizabethan artifacts and amad chase across England. What do these things have to dowith one another? I'm not sure, but Malone manages toweave them together in this hilarious tale of a collegeprofessor drawn into a set of most complicatedcircumstances. Malone's writing is superb."
1,Bad Halloween Effects,"I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself.I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth."
1,I Have a Better Chance of Scaring Rob Zombie.,"This is the worst Halloween sound effects CD I have ever heard. Who did this? It's ridiculously awful; I mean, what is that? ""Velcome to my house."" This is freaking terrible. This won't scare anybody; they'll just be rolling on the floor laughing. How pathetic."
2,Halloween effects,"The cd is not very good, it skips a lot and the sounds are not as good as I thought that they would be."
4,Halloween assortments,"Very short rapid playing clips of halloween sounds, which has been done before in similar fashion on Sounds from the crypt CD, which can be played as goofy fun, or inserted between the tracks of music at a halloween DJ party, depending on what sound you desire like goofy witches, falling screams, mad organs, spirals, vortex, wind, ghosts, and promises of utter doom! Not to be taken seriously, and if this CD scares you, you really need to go to bed early, with a glass of milk."
1,Don't buy these plugs! MSD box chews them up,Farmall H modified open class. 2600 rpm. MSD box and these plugs DO NOT LAST!!!! JUNK JUNK JUNK!!! NGK WORKED GREAT!!!
5,I'm a big fan of this.......fan,"I live in Northern Minnesota and find that dew has been a problem so far in this early winter season; I could have used a computer fan and DIY with a fisherman's battery, but this was convenient and it works well. I tend to leave the fan running and have not noticed any wobbling or view distortion."
4,"Informative, Relaxing & Great Preparation","I used this video alongside Pilates classes during my second pregnancy and found it clear, calming and just the right pace for my changing body shape - there's no way I could have kept up with anything faster at 7 months pregnant!I found it very informative, relaxing and a great way to focus myself in preparation for labour."
4,Very helpful,"I started using this DVD when I was 5 months pregnant and really enjoyed it. The exercises really helped my aches and pains, especially in my lower back. I've recommended it to my pregnant friends."
1,rent before buying!,"After reading the reviews posted here I decided to rent it before buying. What a good decision! The pace is just painfully slow. The stretches are all very nice and very gentle, but to be honest I could not even finish it. It stops between all moves to introduce the next move, and while you can certainly fast-forward through those intros, it's very annoying to have to do that. If you have 1.5 hours to kill and aren't looking for a good-paced workout, then I guess this DVD would be good for you. I'll never use it again, though."
2,Yuck- a real snooze-fest!,"Before pregnancy I was working out 3-4 times per week with the Jennifer Kries pilates DVDs (which are great by the way) and after becoming pregnant, purchased this one to continue my exercise routine. I was SO disappointed in this one. It is achingly slow. Doing this video is like being in a trance state. In addition, between each exercise there's about a minute of nothing- just music and ""slo-mo"" footage of misc body parts moving, which I can't stand. I bought it because it looked serious- I didn't want any cheerleader-type perkily bouncing around, but I didn't want to be bored either! What a waste of $30.00 too- WAY overpriced- the production is cheesy also."
1,Way too slow,"I cannot believe that they put a 30 second ""intro"" inbetween each exercise!! It was totally ridiculous! I don't recommend this DVD at all!"
3,PILATES,I have found this DVD to be very boring. Her explanations are long and you cannot skip them. There should be an option to skip instructions once you have the hang of it. I found the movements good for pregnancy.
2,Slow and boring,"The long explanations are overkill, even for the first time you do the workout. It almost put me to sleep. The workout itself is very low-intensity."
1,This item is not closed captioned,Amazon incorrectly has this item listed as closed captioned. If you are hearing impaired and buying this video based on that information do not bother as it is a waste of money.
3,"Exercise fine, but presentation poor.","For a beginner and for being pregnant, the exercises are good. Less intense than I'm used to, but helps with flexibility.Unfortunately, the presentation is poor. The instructor stops the exercise to announce the next movement, which lasts a minute or two, disrupting the flow. You find yourself antsy and waiting for her to stop talking and get on with it. It would be a better dvd if they had figured out a way to explain the exercise while creating a smooth transition to the next exercise. I solved the problem by continuing to do the previous exercise while she was talking. But, it would be nice to have it flow more."
2,Pilates in Pregnancy,"This was a very slow moving workout. Literally, one move at a time with long pauses between each one. Very slow and boring. I am very disappointed with the amount of money I spent on this. It is long and has a lot of different moves, but that's it. You would be better off buying ""Yoga Mama"" by Crunch videos."
4,College Level Economics,"OK, this is not a self-study workbook for the casual person. This is a rigorous, college text, and slogging through the material can be rather difficult. The heart is math. You need to know the equation y = mx + b, and how this appears on a graph.I doubt that his book will work as an independent study book, since the material is presented in a rather stark and schematic matter. The descriptions on equations, graphs, and external factors, and how they interact can often become quite obscure and inscrutable. However, it does a fabulous job of having many examples on how a change in external factors or the equation can affect the graph, and vice versa, providing much illumination as a supplementary text to a standard text on macroeconomics that does a mediocre job of describing these phenomena.It has these chapters:2 on introductory stuff6 on the IS-LM Framework3 on aggregate supply and demand3 on money supply, consumption, and business investment."
3,There is no good book on macro,This book is good for first or second year undergrads who need to understand fundamental definitions. Essentially there is no standard book on macroeconomics because there are many models. A good macro book for graduate level would be the one which covers all models and explains the shortcomings of each - Alas that book would need to be an encyclopedia!
5,Scratch & Solve Hangman Book,"These books are overpriced at the store, in my opinion. It's nioe to find a bargain price. Was well satisfied with price & service from this seller."
4,great Christian hardcore/metal,this is one of the best hardcore albums you will ever hear! they are great live and this cd is a mere dab of the genius that is Training for Utopia.
1,why choose that name for the record?,"I actually thought this was the band Falling Cycle and got really excited. Well, this is not it."
1,Beyond readability,"Wish I could give this book more stars. I wanted to like it - the author's credentials as a psychologist and columnist for ""Poker Player"" seemed promising - but it's too badly written and too lacking in fresh ideas. It's the same old story, somewhat mangled and dressed up in the author's pet jargon.For tells, you're still better off with the Caro book, even though it's dated; and for poker psychology, you're much, much better off reading the two 2+2 titles - the Alan Schoonmaker book, ""The Psychology of Poker,"" and the John Feeney book, ""Inside the Poker Mind."""
2,Beyond Math Poker,"A book on poker tells that is a useful companion to Mike Caro's definitive ""Book of Tells""."
5,4 movie set that gives great value,"I was looking for Moving when I found this Richard Pryor 4-movie set. It's almost the same price as buying Moving by itself, but this way you get an extra 3 movies to enjoy, so I'll say it's good value for your money."
4,richard pryor,"One of my favorite movies. The case and disc, was in mint condition. I love Lorenz Tate. Its definitely worth the price."
5,classic Richard Pryor,typical Richard Pryor movies. funny adult comedies that might not be suited for a younger crowd. its a must have for all Richard Pryor fans. you get 4 movies for less than the price of one making it a great buy for those on a budget.
3,"Moving is awful, get it for the others","I already had a copy of The Mack on DVD, and Greased Lightning on VHS. I basically purchased this because of the excellent price, and thought I'd give the other two movies a go. After all, Moving seems to have rave reviews on here.The Mack and Greased Lightning are great and well worth the purchase. Uptown Saturday Night I think I've seen maybe twenty years ago but haven't had a chance to watch it yet. I have to say though that I turned Moving off before it even reached the end of the film. This would be one of the least funny comedies I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt embarrassed for the actors. I guess if you like National Lampoon you might like it.Greased Lightning is the story of NASCAR legend Wendell Scott. It also stars Pam Grier and Beau Bridges. It has its faults but overall it is a good movie. The Mack is a classic of its genre. I am hoping that Uptown Saturday Night will not disappoint but I can't recommend Moving."
3,Victorian History Lite,"Victorian England produced scores of great soldiers and explorers. Three of the most famous were the soldiers Valentine Baker and Charles ""Chinese"" Gordon and the explorer Samuel Baker. Brian Thompson's Imperial Vanities is a biography which intertwines the lives of these three larger than life characters.Many books have been written about each of these men. They lived exciting lives crammed with adventure and drama. The three were some of the most colorful characters of the Nineteenth Century. Brian Thompson is a good writer and he does an excellent job of weaving their stories together. However, in the end these three characters lived such rich lives that it is an injustice to try to tell their stories in just 254 pages.This is a good book for anybody who wants a quick sketch. I would not recommend this book for someone who loves Victorian England and the stories of the men who carved out an Empire."
2,Just okay,"I couldn't find many options for liquid vitamin C for infants that was (mostly) natural, so I tried this. I found it a bit difficult to pour without making a mess, and my usually adventurous taster hated the taste for some reason-- the dosage didn't help much either as it's a larger amount compared to others. It's okay for mixing into foods though. Be aware that it stains horribly, turned my baby's clothes a fluorescent yellow that would not come off! I'll probably try a different brand next time with a more concentrated dosage."
4,Pulsar PPH429,"Happy with the watch. This is about my third watch in the past few years. Watch lasts (for me)about three years because I'm wear it all the time. Battery has to be replace about once a year. When just a little moisture starts setting up in it, then that is when you usually have to start replacing it. Watch is not water resistant (even though it states it is 30mm-) Like if light rain or if washing dishes and a drop gets on it, wipe quickly. Watch over all is very nice and is perfect for me because I have a very small wrist..... I've very picky so whenever I get a watch, it has to be this one.Great value for the price."
3,hat review,"Hat was intact, but they sent me a childs cap when the description clearly said adult size. too much of a hassle to return. $10 isn't worth the time. The other hat I ordered was full size. $10 for a Dodger cap is good. At least my kids can wear the White Sox one."
5,"Soul Journey, the book","If you are in any form of ministry, this is a MUST READ. If you are a single christian, this is a MUST READ. Loved it!! This book is humorous, yet real. Will take your breath away, while encouraging your heart."
3,Soul At Stake,"I admire the author for writing a subject that is so misunderstood about women pastors. Unfortunately, many are forever learning and never coming into the knowledge of the Truth, as with Journee. Her father stood his ground on not only believing, but actually knowing for a fact, that women pastors are a ""no-no."" If you are a believer in The Holy Bible, it clearly outlines a woman's position in the body of Christ and it does not include pastorship. Speaking of pastorship, there was another novel I read called ""Lust of the Flesh"" by Beverly Rolyat and it had a woman pastor name Reverend Hall as one of the characters (and she was a trip). ""Lust of the Flesh"" was an outstanding read because the author showed how when a woman takes a superior position as a pastor over many flock, she outlined what the outcome could bring.Although ""Soul Journey"" is a story that is easy to follow, it leaves some characters with cliffhangers, which leads the readers to believe that sequels will follow."
2,Good fit and soft...but the band doesn't breathe!,"Everything about this is great (sizing, softness, holds up well in the wash)...except the band feels sweaty! It's too bad, because the rest feels pretty good. Maybe I will use these more during cold weather."
2,Pretty bad,"I liked Millennium and I wanted to know what happened to Jordan, which is why this gets two stars instead of one, but this is a pretty low quality production with a confusing storyline and bad acting. Renting it for $2 and watching it online was about as much as I was willing to spend on it."
3,Rehash from Star Wars Geonosis Arena,"Good job on this one - Invert the Geonosis playset and add a new top level and panels - you get a Cobra Mountain. It is $10.00 cheaper at Target and I love the dead battle droids embedded in the ground, looks neat and can easily be used as a Trade Federation bunker besides just for GI JOE."
1,The Colors Bleed,"They don't mention this anywhere in the product description, but this isn't regular tissue paper. It is ""bleeding art tissue paper"". That means the tissue paper bleeds colors all over everything."
4,This is BLEEDING art TISSUE PAPER ... NOT good for GIFT BAGS!,"This is nice, good quality ART, BLEEDING tissue paper. (""Bleeding"" means that the color transfers easily. If the paper gets wet from water (or sweat), it gets all over/stains your hands.) If that's what you want/need it for, then it is perfect. There are LOTS of shades of very nice BRIGHT and PALE colors. If you are looking for nice gift bag/wrapping paper, this is NOT it. There is a nice variety of various shades of colors, and while they look pretty, they also can/do stain."
2,Not as Advertised,"Half of the songs on this ""album"" are not by the Hi-Lo's. Interspersed with genuine Hi-Lo's songs are a few College Glee Club numbers. They're not bad, don't know who they are, but they've little to do with the Hi-Lo's. (Amazon needs to check this out again.)"
3,Not entire novel,"Very nice to see this book in contemporary circulation. However, the first chapter entitled ""Prologue"" is missing from this edition and therefore cheats the reader of the entire context of the novel."
4,Prayer Primer,"This book is a selective primer on biblical praying, examining the prayers of Paul. Each chapter studies a particular prayer from his letters, exploring what Paul prays for and why. For example-in his analysis of 2 Thessalonians 1:3-12, Dr. Carson illustrates how Paul's anticipation of Jesus' return shapes what he prays for the people.This book was inspirational to me in at least two ways: I find I am praying for people and needs in a more Christ-centered way. I have also grown in my understanding of what it means to pray to a sovereign God.The reflection questions at the end of each chapter help to make this a very practical book. It would work well for individual or group study, taking one chapter at a time and steadily putting the new insights into practice. I heartily recommend it."
1,A huge disappointment to genuine fashionistas,"I couldn't disagree more heartily with those who recommended this book as a ""beautiful coffee table book."" At this price and with this subject matter this could have been a truly amazing look at the history of the House of Chanel and it's transition from the early years of Coco to the present leadershiop of Karl Lagerfeld. The text is mediocre and the photos are terrible. The general visual quality of the book is absolutely reprehensible.The dresses are all reproduced in a poor quality ""Liz Taylor in the White Diamonds commercial"" fake fuzzy lens. There is not one really great photo of an actual garment in this entire book. As someone who saw the actual exhibit the book is based on, I feel the Metropolitan really missed on this one. The exhibit itself was magnificent, this poorly concieved book is a complete dud. Save your money for one of the many other books detailing the life and work of Coco Chanel."
3,Museum displays in a book.,"Interesting look at the Chanel collection through the years. The book conveys that it is part of a museum collection. Alhtough they try to add some graphics to the ""mannequins"" the display of the clothes are very much similar to what may be displayed in a museum."
3,Eh,"I bought this book after seeing the Chanel exhibit at the Met. The pictures are nice, but I wish they showed more pictures of real people wearing clothes as opposed to the eccentric mannequins they used in the exhibit. A couple of blank pages here and there. I wish there was slightly more history behind the clothes. Still not a bad coffee table book on Chanel"
1,Don't Buy,"I ordered a new book but received a used, dirty copy. I was billed for the new book though ($267). I contacted Amazon to request a replacement but was told I had to contact the seller. I THOUGHT Amazon was the ""seller"". I contacted the ""seller"", anybook.com and was asked to spend my money to return their mistake and then once received they would credit my account. I called Amazon who said there was nothing they could do. My most serious issue is that Amazon shared my credit card information without my permission. To date there has been no resolution."
5,"Profound Wisdom, Easy To Read","I really enjoyed this book, not only for the profound wisdom it containes, but also for the format which makes it easy to read and easy to assimilate. It's not long, complicated lectures about spiritual growth, but rather short gems of wisdom that are practicle and useable in our every day life. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's understanding and insight into the human heart, psyche, and behavior is remarkable. I also recommend another book of his titled God Loves Fun"
2,Nearsighted on a Sony CCD-TR500,"This lens has a problem, shared with the Sunpak CAL-1160 37mm 2x lens, in that when used on a Sony CCD-TR500 camcorder zoomed in, the camcorder can't focus beyond about 50 feet. The higher-grade lens, the Kenko SGT-20Hi, on the other hand, does not have this problem, and I would recommend it over the SGT-20. All the 37mm 2x lenses I've tested on this camcorder share the problem of vignetting when it is zoomed out to wide angle---something not mentioned in the Web descriptions of these lenses."
4,rodeo riders,"The Saddle Club: Carole, Stevie and Lisa take a trip out West to visit their friend Kate, a championship rider, whose parents run a dude ranch. Trouble is brewing in the form of a rival dude ranch which is stealing away business from the Bar None, Kate's family's ranch. When they impulsively register for a barrel racing contest, they hope to win, even though they are amateurs, but more importantly, they hope to garner positive publicity for the ranch. A nice change from the English riding themed books in the series."
5,This Punk/Hardcore Cd rocks!,"This cd is great. It incorporates punk, emo, and great christian hardcore. I recamond it ninety to one."
4,spaghetti claw me,"Excellent product. A little on the big side (long), but otherwise it does what it does. It grabs pasta noodles, stirs them and seperates them."
2,Not this couple's cup o' tea,"We loved the first Cyborgasm, but this one didn't have the appeal. Track 4 ""The Housewife and the Businessman"" was a waste of space. The gay men in two of the tracks bothered my spouse to no end. Not as good as the first."
3,A piece of Delphi history,"I remember when I ran Paradox Atlanta, a Paradox Users Group, and hearing about Delphi for the first-time. My first thought was ""Oh no, another Borland tool that I don't have time to learn. But I know that I'm going to have fun learning it..."".17 years later this blurb, which in the last paragraph describes Delphi as "".. an excellent tool for reducing the backlog of in-house corporate applications"", reminds me of my first giddy days of learning how to transition from database progrsmming in Paradox to object-oriented programming in Delphi. And 17 years later many in-house corporate applications are still being maintained in Delphi.Good times.Michael Hassler, PresidentLTA Systems, Inc."
5,Great,"So many ""new"" authors, so little time to read. This was an excellent page turner. Genealogy can reveal many interesting secrets. ""Torie"" O'Shea and her family are a good new entry into the mystery field. Enough suspense to keep you guessing and enough clues to help you figure out the crime. This is the second author I've taken to recently from this group. Laurell K Hamilton also writes an excellent story. Keep up the good work."
5,Great Opening Book For a Trilogy,The Outstreched Shadow is up on my list of new series. Mercedes Lackey continues to impress and reinvent the genre.
4,Enjoyable Escape!,"It was fun to read ""The Outstretched Shadow""! The story drew me in and kept me. Although a predictable genre (dissatisfied youth discovers great magical talent and saves world), it had enough twists, turns, and interesting world detail to keep me hooked. Without even ordering a preview, I bought the second book, ""To Light a Candle"". I don't see the 3rd one online; is it pending?"
4,4+,"Kinda long and detailed,BUT entertaining ideas and characters.This a great foundation to build on.So many things can and will happen.I a excited about the future books in this series, and hopethe authors will follow through."
3,rather gloomy,"While it is well written, barring some monotonous internal angst by the protagonist, it's just too grim for me. It only gets crueler in the next book, which I had to stop reading.I read to escape to a nicer reality, not one that's a horrific maelstrom of demonic sadism and inescapable doom."
3,Ultimately gave up due to long-winded writing,"I guess this book just wasn't for me. The long descriptions didn't help me get a sense of the world at all. I ended up skimming after the 30th page or so. I do think it's an interesting premise, and a lot of thought must have gone into the book, so perhaps more patient readers will enjoy The Outstretched Shadow.PROS: unique use of magic, good premiseCONS: writing style, didn't connect with characters"
3,"Great book, better with half the words","The plot and story line of this book and its two follow on books is really very imaginative and interesting. But the story could have been just as good with half the words. The authors seem to think that I had forgotten what they had previously written. Detailed descriptions of homes, forests, fortresses, etc... were repeated every time the characters visited them. I had to start skipping the descriptions of the elves water-fire room after the third description. Do read the book, just know that when you start to read descriptions for the second, third, and fourth time that you can safely skip to the next page."
4,"Pretty good, reminds me of the old Lackey books","If you liked the older Lackey books, Arrows series, Mage Winds series, this will remind you of them. It is a much better book and beginning of a series than the last few of the Valdemar series she has turned out. Please note this is not in the Valdemar series but has much in common."
5,Really a different read,"I'm not usually Mercedes Lackey's biggest fan - her books are frequently a lot of the same thing, over... and over... and over. Joust and Alta, two of Lackey's latest (and both unrelated to the Valdemar books) read much like her other, more prolific series. This one, however, was quite different - and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The main character, Kellen, is a believable person - perfectly willing to sit on his backside and watch the world fly past him until something *really* needles him - in which case he picks himself up and decides to do something about it. The other characters in the book are equally enticing - particularly the centaurs, a race you don't always find in good fantasy novels - I suppose because it's difficult to draw them in nicely. Lackey and Mallory have definitely done that.On a whole, the Outstretched Shadow was a wonderful book, and I'm eagerly awaiting it's sequels."
3,Lackey: Just a little slower than usual,"I really liked this booked. However I feel a need to warn everyone that it is slow at first. I like getting alot of background on a new world and the main characters, But I usually prefer that you grab my attention first. The book spends a great deal of time at the begining going over history from one view point, and giving us a great deal of information on the homeland of the main character. But it is not until much later in the book that anything actual begins to happen.I would have prefered the book to start out with some action or decision then started giving us the background information which I think could have been done easily.All of that aside The Story is great and I can't wait for the second book."
3,Find the Scissors!,"Interesting setting, interesting characters, but far, far too long. Needs to be cut by about 100 pages. The pace is glacial, the same ground gets covered again and again. This isn't being paid by the word, it's being paid by the pound.It could have been such a good book-the elements are there."
5,Wonderful!,"It's hard to explain what, exactly, is so captivating about this book. There is a certain fascination in the language that seems to grab hold of the reader and refuse to turn him/her loose until the very end. All of the books in this trilogy (The Outstretched Shadow, To Light a Candle, When Darkness Falls) are absolutely riveting.It's a fairly classic tale of good verses evil, but with shades of gray as well. There are the usual suspects of Elves, Centaurs, Demons, Witches, Wizards, and Humans. There are knights in armor, fire-breathing dragons, dangerous battles, ardorous treks, and all the other trappings of your typical fantasy tale. However, don't let the 'typical' turn you away, because this book, and its sequels, are far from typical. The characters come alive. You'll grow with them, laugh with them, cry with them, and in the end, be surpised and saddened that the end has arrived so suddenly."
3,Too Dark and Forboding,"I enjoyed this book, but at times it became a bit too dark. I would rather have a fun and enjoyable story, such as The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. He kept the actin rolling without all the dark imagry.I would still reccomend this book to anyone who likes a good book to read in the dark of night, maybe not for young teens, but overall, a good job"
3,I've Seen Better,"The 1991 Holiday edition Barbie is the 2nd in the African American edition of the Holiday Series. I am not a fan of the green velvet gown and the facial mold is a lot less ethnic than I like to see in the African American dolls but this is the era of Mattel using a standard mold for all of the dolls and simply changing the color of the vinyl. The box is an odd shaped box and is difficult to store but if you want to have the whole set, she's a necessity."
4,Bach 2002 Elite Trumpet Mute,"This is my first mute purchased and it definitely has a unique tone of its own. It doesn't have the same jazz tone as a full copper mute, however, overall I would rate it as a very good mute. (gift recipient response)"
4,Vastly Underrated. Vastly Unheard Of.,"Speck is a great band that should be heard of..well..., more places than they are. Even though the Newsboys are my all-time fav, Speck's debut (11 tracks, in case you were wondering)is much better then that of the Newsboys. From the screams of ""Need It,"" to the great-sounding rock-with-hymn-like-words ""Mercy,"" to the comedic lyrics of ""Brilliant"", to ""Skin"" crying out against discrimination & racism, this belongs in your collection.The only reason that I rank this below their second, and last :>( album, Gogglebox, is because every track (top-to-bottom) isn't above-average. A wonderful album nonetheless.The Christian rock world needs to know about Speck, and here I am telling you about them."
2,2 1/2 months and NO improvement in pigment,"This product has turned out to be a big zero for me. In 2 1/2 months I have not noticed even the slightest improvement as I did with my previous product.I didn't give it one star because it has not caused any negative results, just no positive ones. A big waste of money for me. :("
4,Fantastic product when used correctly.,"So far I have been pleased with the results from using this pigment correcting serum. I am a redhead with an abundance of freckles and a couple of significant dark spots that have bothered me for some time. I started using the pigment gel around August twice daily as directed on the bottle. In October I reduced the application to once daily - sometimes less. Within about six weeks there was noticeable lightening of my freckles as well as the dark spots.A bit of forewarning - if you suffer from sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you. I did experience some mild blistering and irritation on my chin after a few weeks of use, which cleared up after a hiatus from the product. The serum is smooth and absorbs easily, but does have a strong chemical smell and WILL bleach fabric. Make sure to apply well before bedtime to avoid ruining your pillowcase."
5,Super price,I have been using the Gel for 10 years. Everyone asks what I use to have such a nice face. I tell them PCA pHaze 13.It is the best and they should all try it.
1,PCA SKIN PHAZE 13 NO NO NO,THIS WAS THE WORST PRODUCT I EVER USED...ALL THE HIGH REVIEWS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS PRODUCT WAS A HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT. NOT TRUE. IT left my face with red bumps and it looked horrible. I will stick to Dermalogica and Philosophy products. A total waste of money!!!!
1,RUINED MY SKIN IN 3DAYS,"I AM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN. I HAVE THE COMPLEXTION OF ABOUT A SHADE DARKER THAN BEYONCE THE SINGER. THIS PRODCUT LITERALLY BURNED OFF MY SKIN. MY DARK SPOTS GOT DARKER. I REPEAT DARKER. THEN WHEN I WASHED MY FACE BY THE THIRD DAY THEY PEELED OFF AND PINK FLESH APPEARED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE. NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX MY SKIN FROM THIS DAMAGING PRODUCT. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY THIS PRODUCT ANYWAY, GO WITH THE TRAVEL SIZE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AS A MEANS TO TEST IT OUT. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. GOOD LUCK TO ALL."
2,Too small,"My two year old can fit this entirely in his mouth. It's too small, it doesn't even look like a tomato it's so small. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,A Must For Visually Handicapped,"I bought this magnifier for my husband who broke his after many years of use and He was so pleased at the quality of the magnifier. He has Nystagmus and very low vision. This magnifier is hand held and helps him get a close to things as he needs to. We had looked for a magnifier of this quality for awhile, so he was so pleased when we found this one. He uses it everyday. Great Product."
4,A crazy double feature DVD that offers insight into the world of J-Horror and Thai Horror movies,"With Dual-Layer DVD technology, you get 2 films in one disc.Sick Nurses, though I've translated the Thai title to be ""entrails-dragging nurses"" is a gory film which comes together quite nicely. However, gory is an understatement, so be advised.Pulse, one of the earlier films by the esteemed Kiyoshi Kurosawa (not related to the famous Akira Kurosawa), is a needed change of pace. Not gory at all, but there is definitely a sense of a slow, creeping threat. As always Kurosawa explores deep themes of psychology.Unfortunately, I think the slowness of pulse meant it should be watched before the crazy, sick, heart-thumping terror of Sick Nurses. I watched sick nurses first, and couldn't concentrate too well on pulse, thus the film ended up being a little confusing. I would have to watch it again."
1,a nice but unreadable book,"the prints are so small and light , there would be more enjoy if it is in good printing. do not buy this edition."
4,interesting but slow,"Full of imaginded details, flavor of tribe life. little action, much feelings. a chick book."
3,Nice demonstration of forms,"The DVD is Chinese with English subtitles. There were reasonably frequent chapter markers, but it still required a fair bit of rewinding and fast forwarding to focus on specific areas. The twelve styles were presented first, before the five elements, which seemed counter-intuitive. Some attention is given to instruction but it is predominantly a demonstration of forms (often multiple forms per style/element).I am not qualified to comment on the quality of the Xing Yi, but the demonstrations were clearly presented, from a couple angles, and were very thorough. A beginner could follow most of the forms. The practice forms did not look overly ornate either - very practically oriented. There was no instruction concerning applications (at least in the subtitles).This was good value for me. I would have liked better DVD navigation and some more instructional material for a five star rating, but it was worth the very reasonable price."
3,"Good, but not for first-time poetry readers","While engaging, ""She"" isn't the movie ""Slam"" on paper. It is a decidedly personal collection of pieces which the accompanying unmarked 21 minute CD clearly proves, with its starkness (for those in the know: this is NOT like Williams' ""Lyricist Lounge"" offering either). Having enjoyed his work in ""Slam"" and other assorted venues, I had expected more energy to pile out of the book, but Williams knows that the page is not the stage, nor should they be. He has offered up a work that best speaks to poets, people familiar with poetry or lover of words, but it is not the kind of book that people who enjoyed ""Slam"" may find terribly riveting for very long, if ever. A poet myself, I wanted Williams' ascension in popularity to usher in not only first-time lovers of poetry, but LONG-TIME lovers of poetry. I fear that the book, while good, may potentially scare off literary virgins used to fiery performances and cinematic codification of a grand emerging artist."
4,"I came I Saul, oh bad one there huh","Really though, Saul Williams is one of the great modern poets. He has been an integral part of bringing that poetic voice back to the masses. Poetry is a lost art form in this modern world and it is wonderful to see, hear, and yes feel the wonder of the written and spoken word. If you have been looking for a good introduction to Saul or Slam poetry this book is it."
5,soul controller,"quik qoute: ""I draw a blank, I think it is the best thing I've ever drawn."" This book is beyond. Buy this book and buy your best homie a copy and study it. This is poetry at it's soulful and truthful BEST. Truly some next level lyrics, I love it. peace and oh yeah, buy this book!"
5,A must read for the Net Generation,"Saul Williams is an incredible musician and slam poet. His skills as a literary poet are just as big. Williams has the uncanny ability to blend a strong hip-hop and urban sensibility with his more feminine yoga spiritual self. The tension between these polar selves operates throughout this amazing book. I see this book as a piece of healing, not just for Williams but for so many of us that feel simultaneous rage, apathy, and love for the world. The book holds up over time and gives a unique voice and way to go forward from here. I like that young poets like Williams and Eric Wilkinson,Black Through A Distortion Pedal, resist the trappings of postmodern nihilism and never lose sight of the powerful liberation thrust of early hip hop. These poets are doing for North America what Roberto Bolano's poetry,The Romantic Dogs, did for South America."
3,all god but the maine track,"I ordered this cd for one song and one song only, Tico Tico. The whole album was great, but the first track which happened to be tico tico was defective. I ordered two of these cd's and had the same problem on bothof them. I eventually ordered another Ethel Smith cd with that song on it and that one was fine."
4,Reference to 18th century costuming,I make porcelain dolls and found this book invaluable for costuming the dolls in authentic dresses.The settings for the costumes is also very inspiringAngonita Blue Ribbon Dolls
1,Beautiful costumes,"This book is a great resource for the Rococo period. Seeing the actual garments on mannequins in situ is lovely. I also like the supporting portraits, prints and quotes."
2,Wrong Image,"Be carefull, actually wrong image is shown: image is from sub-zero guitar boomers, but if you order, you receive Electric Guitar Boomer Set (as written). So, if you wonna to buy sub-zeros, this place is not for you."
4,Not quite Northern soul,"This record was a real pain to find (located it out of print, mid-winter 2002 in a CD shop in Syracuse, NY). It's not quite like the Chicago soul of the same period, and bears little in common with Northern soul of the same era.Key names here would be Essau, Lori Ann (young female singer), Emerson Brown & The Del Rios and Pheasants. Essau's track, ""What Did I Do To You,"" is worth the price of admission. There's definite links here to early Philly soul acts like the Intruders and Thom Bell acts like the Delfonics. Fans of early seventies Philly Soul looking to take a step back to about '65 will enjoy this collection. Soul completists, take heed."
5,strange and good....,"bought it today at lovegarden in lawrence, ks.....one of the last great record stores.....i'm enjoying the overall strangeness of this comp. philly sound? not really....but these songs will make you sit up and take notice....and say, 'did i just hear that?' playing it on kkfi.org."
3,Was disappointed,"Not as brilliant and fast as I'd expected. Bought both discs. Prefer Davis. Oop, except through an ArkivMusic reissue."
4,very good history of the Waffen-SS,"This book is an excellent general reference to the Waffen-SS. Cover most of the major campaigns and also includes sections on training, origins and atrocities.Overall a well balanced account.Valhalla's Warriors: A History of the Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front 1941-1945"
4,Comedy with a good dose of reality,"It's so true. You hit a certain age and 1) Your checking an box on surveys that makes you cringe, 2) you become your parent's parent, 3) you now remind the people you want to date of their parents (ouch), 4) you know that based on your portfolio you'll have to work until your dead - but at what?ABOUT FIFTY is an honest and smile-inducing look at this unique ""bend in the road."" Simple, clear and funny where it should be. Wonderful story telling, great use of location and a fabulous cast."
5,Excellent,"From the back cover:""Delaney Walker has a secret. The celebrated designer of erotic lingerie is actually too ""nice"" to wear it. But when her fiancé says ""I do"" to someone else, Delaney decides to change her image. And she's going to start by going through with the boudoir photos she'd arranged for her groom-to-be. Only, little does she guess that once photographer Sam Martelli sets eyes on her, he'll insist on putting himself in the picture....Sam has photographed hundreds of beautiful women, but none have affected him like Delaney. Even before she strips down to just a whisper of silk, casting off her inhibitions as well as her clothes, he has to have her. And thanks to a power failure, he does...again and again. But once the lights come back on, can Sam convince her that their one night was more than just a case of indecent exposure...?Decidedly naughty newcomer Rhonda Nelson shows why you can't take the bed out of the boudoir..."""
3,It's OK,"If you're looking for a quick romance read, this might be the book for you. For me, the story dragged on and on when you knew from the first chapter what was going to happen at the end. It just didn't grab me and make me feel for the characters."
2,This monopoly flopped,"As collectors of Monopoly, we thought this one would be fun for our daughter. It's not very exciting, and lost our interest very quickly."
2,Not one of Anne's best book's,"I have read all of Anne's older books and they keep me wanting to keep reading and turning the page to see what was going to happen next.But, either the Kindle version was cut or there were parts missing like the END!I expected for find out what happen to both of the lead actors. BUT, it just leaves you hanging. Maybe Anne is getting old, and had a senior moment thinking she had written an ending, but forgot!"
1,Speaker Seems to Be Shorting Out,"Purchased a set of speakers which act like there is an internal short in the speaker. This short causes the audio to cut out randomly.The speakers were defective and kept shorting out. The seller then would not exchange, repair or refund the speakers even though they were 1 month old.They have a 1 year Manu Warranty, which means nothing.I then contacted Pioneer to see if I could send them the speakers for a return, exchange or repair. Pioneer does not want anything to do with it, either. They told me I have to send it to the Seller. Well, the seller does not want them back. What am I suppose to do now? Now, I have to fight with the seller and Pioneer.Total screw job. Do NOT buy Pioneer. If you do, you better hope everything works fine.Pioneer Customer Service = Crap"
5,Excellent speakers.,Pioneeer speakers quality is legendary and I am not disapointed. These speakers are great even without an amp. Plus the colour scheme matches my vehicle. Execellent sound quality I can't complain. Amazon was great pairing these speakers with a pair of 6 inch door speakers. Fantastic.
3,Cute Cute Cute! But runs small in size.,"This toe ring is adorable and of good quality. However you must have the skinniest of toes for it to fit and not either come off or pinch like heck. I bought it for my mom for her birthday and we couldn't even adjust it to fit her toes. I then tried it, and I've had on a toe ring for many years, and it hurt me as well. Too bad because it's really cute and even has a stone in the center which I did not realize when selecting it.No harm no foul though. We are donating it to a benefit auction for a family member with cancer."
4,"Joe, Wilton, Hoops in Japan","Great performance, with Barry Finnerty doing a very good job filling in for Larry Carlton and Alfonso Johnson filling in with bass. Some may miss Wayne Henderson's trombone, and while Finnerty and some other guitarist rip with lead and rhythm, Carlton's sweetness is missed. Great quality early digital recording."
4,Ready for my close up Mr Deville!,Basic set of extesion tubes that are of very sound construction and design. Very Happy with the product and look forward to many years of use out of them. Solid.
2,Underaverage,"This book is just way too broad to be of much help to a serious collector. However, if you need a cheap, VERY quick overview of world coins, this book is OK.Unfortunately, there are a good number of countries that do not have coins listed. I don't have a huge amount of world coins, but I was able to find only a little over half of my coins in this book.With so many different countries' coins listed, this book can't contain very many grades of each coin.If there is a particular foreign country that you are interested in collecting its coins, you'll want to go elsewhere for a more specific reference. This is not the book for specifics.However, there are a few handy essays at the beginning of the book on how to buy coins, spot a bad deal, and so on. There's also some references to on-line help.This book isn't terrible; it will give you a nice intro into a particular country's coins (if it covers that country), but for me, it's not very valuable."
3,SO SO,"A very good reference for the collector of world coins who knows where the coins are from, bu t a poor reference for coins in which the country is unknown to you. Also very limited in the number of countries that it covers."
4,ANOTHER BBC COMEDY HIT,"NOW THAT HER HUBBY HAS DUMPED HER FOR A YOUNG BABE MAGGIE MUST NOW TRY TO MAINTAIN HER SANITY WHILE PUTTING UP WITH THE KIDS, JOB + FRIENDS. THE BBC GETS IT RIGHT ONCE MORE IN PROVIDING COMEDIC CONTENT."
1,Rediculously bad,"I usually force myself to finish books, even if I am not particularly enjoying them, but this was one I just could not stand for one more page. I found McCloy's descriptions of the NYC lesbian scene to be inane. I'm not from NYC but I am a lesbian, and it was completely unrealistic. Backstage with Betty -- give me a break! And frankly, having a conversation with a gay man is just not the wildly risque experience the author makes it out to be. Her characters left me cold; I didn't care WHAT happened, I was just wishing something interesting and/or halfway believable would. I have no clue what the reviewers are talking about, calling McCloy a great stylist. She is not nearly good enough to disdain the use of quotation marks. Not even worth 1 star, in my opinion. If you want to read about lesbians in the big city, I recommend Sarah Schulman instead, a far better writer: After Delores, Rat Bohemia, etc."
3,agree about Jade is pretentious and a bit cliche,"When writers use stock characters like Jade it makes them unendearing and not likeable. Also, moral issues of Jade's flightiness and irresponsibility don't arise at all, or obliquely if they do. I admire hard work and effort at a tedious temp job over selling your body to the highest bidder as Jade did in several circumstances. That would leave me with an empty feeling emulating that behavior. I don't see the glamour in it, nor the New York club scene. I am glad it is not my coming-of-age story. Prefer the more subtle, work-ethic story ""Of Human Bondage"" coming-of-age that is more realistic and uplifiting in the end."
