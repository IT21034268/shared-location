2,Poor Ending Story,All the casts were chosen fantastic and performed superb. The ending was very poor with a nonsense finish.
4,A damn good bloody mess!,"Directed by Quentin Tarantino,he goes to a different level. Just as long as you can handle some subtitles this action, scalping and brutally killing Nazis sure makes up for it. Set throughtout the course of World War 2, its a lovely tale of what should have gone down to the Third Reich. Brad Pritt does a damn good job as his team of jews go after the Nazis and Christopher Waltz plays a bad German good at sniffing out jews. kick ass!"
3,Inglourious Basterds,"This movie was interesting, but I did not like the severe violence and showing the visual of all the blood. A clever producer can get the same affect without showing this aspect."
5,My favorite Moviee!!!,"I love love love the 2009 verison of Inglorious Basterds!!! 'I know this is a stupid question before I ask it but can you Americans speak any other language than English?"" haha (I'm American) one of my favorite quotes!!"
3,"Kudos for dialogue and Waltz, pass on the story and the blood.","The split here seems to be about Tarantino and about gore. To be frank, the story is perfectly simplistic and utter fiction; the gore is just unnecessary. Perhaps that's ok for some viewers--clearly it is. The dialogue is largely sharp, though, and the movie is worth watching for Christoph Waltz's performance as SS Col. Landa."
4,"A brawny, rollicking mash-up !","The movie is fun -- Tarantino makes clever use of language and the mechanics of making and projecting movies -- but his ability to juggle multiple storylines isn't as sure as it was in Pulp Fiction, which Basterds resembles structurally.Scenes like the showdown in the tavern and the movie-premiere finale are as imaginative, energetic and, in their own weird, brutal way, beautiful as cinema getsQuentin Tarantino's dual loves of vengeance and cinema have never had a purer expression than the face of a Jewish cinematheque owner projected Oz-like onto the smoke of Nazis aflameAs entertaining as it is audacious, a film that showcases Tarantino in top form and boasts a multitude of characters who could easily carry a movie of their ownAustrian actor Christoph Waltz creates the most compelling big-screen villain since Heath Ledger's Joker. An Oscar-worthy performance."
2,Inglourious Basterds,"Not good. The story line was not fully developed and some of the characters were barely more than faces on the screen. It was a huge disappointment in many ways, not least of which was the brutality. Brad Pitt should have opted for a different script."
2,Great movie - deceptive advertising,"This is a five star movie but the release is very poor. This is a ONE disc set. Sure, there's two discs in the package but only one of them is useful. The ""digital copy"" is expired as of 1/1/11. I just got mine and tried to download my copy to no avail! So, buy it if you want a copy of the movie on BluRay. It looks and sounds great! And, this is a fantastic film by Tarrantino who continues to mature as a filmmaker. For me, the movie seemed odd at first but on subsequent viewings I find myself drawn in further. Some of the scenes with The Jew Hunter are going to be classics, especially the first one - so much tension!I haven't viewed the Special Features, but they seemed pretty sparse. There's no commentary, even. So, this is a not very special edition. Like many BluRay releases, look for this to have a reissue in a couple years in a ""collector's edition"" or something so they can bleed us for a little more cash."
5,6 Star Masterpiece,This masterpiece deserves at least six stars and Academy Awards for the entire cast. It is just that good.Inglourious Basterds (Single-Disc Edition)
3,Funny,Yeah it was kinda funny but hinged on the abiss i hope the actors can get better gigs in their future
3,not my kind of movie,this movie was not one i would watch again. but i bought this for my 18 yr old and he seemed to like it. so to each your own..
1,Boring,"Disappointing for a Tarantino film. Do not know how much the film cost, but it was a big waste of talent and resources. It seems he wanted to explore other type of stories and stamp his seal, but nothing new here that we have not seen in one of his previous films. The basement bar dialogues are so long that at one point become boring. The movie was well filmed and visually is impecable, but the plot did not flow naturally as other films that simultaneously tell three or more stories melting in the end. Tarantino must do better research before he gets involved in a project that is not pure gore or under-world-related story, in THAT he is master. Regrettably to hear Cat People from David Bowie (which BTW was previously used in an 80's film) in a 2010 soundtrack for a WWII film, it just do not fit."
1,1 star is 1star too many,"I don't know what everyone is smoking. Simply, this movie is horrible. Actually beyond horrible. The plot and story line is so predictable. The acting is cliche. As for the violence...it does not add anything to enhance this movie. I always thought tarantino was over-rated and this movie only confirms that for me. Complete and utterly a waste of time."
1,Complete waste of time,"I don't usually review movies but this movie starts out well but then Brad Pitt gets involved. I like Brad Pitt where did he find that southern accent at the dollar store. Did they just give up on making it worth while. I hope they didn't spend much on this because this movie is middle of the road B movie. The bar room scene/chapter was longer then it should have been. Only two chapters are worth watching with the bar room being longer then needed. The chapter at the show had the complete upper elite echelon of the Reich attending a preimer showing of a hero of the Reich's deeds. It had two soldiers guarding Hitler and maybe ten others guarding elsewhere. The whole chapter was a joke. It seems more like the scene was from national lampoon vs this movie. The scenes happen because the writter said it happened. This movie will be $7.99 by year end. What a complete waste of two and 1/2 hours. I would like to carve into Brad Pitt's head that he ""sucks"" its that bad."
1,SUB-TITLES,"UNLESS YOU LIKE TO READ DURING A MOVIE, DON'T BUT THIS ONE. IT IS ALMOST LIKE A FOREIGN FILM THERE ARE SO MANY SUB-TITLES TO READ - SO MUCH IS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF JUST ENGLISH. I SPENT SO MUCH TIME READING WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THAT I DIDN'T GET TO WATCH MUCH OF THE VISUAL."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I am glad I didn't waste the $10 for the movie ticket to see this in the theater. Not even worth the $1 it cost to rent from RedBox. Don't bother wasting your money, not worth it!"
1,Terrible movie,Took my husband and I 3 days to finish this movie it was so bad. I feel kind of bad for brad Pitt.
1,Garbage!,"This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! The poor writing and the contorted plot made it difficult to endure. We have an extensive dvd collection, and this was the first time ever that we threw a dvd in the garbage after viewing it. It was just too horrible to pass on to any other viewer!"
3,wtf subtiltes?,good-emotional story. however the QT dialogue in subtitles got old after 30 minutes. Mike Meyer's cameo is awesome.
1,A movie to avoid...,"If your into mindless violence with no real point this is your movie like any of Quentin Tarantino's movies. If you want a good movie you might want to save your money for a movie like ""the Hangover"". Or heck some porn has a better more engaging plotline. Movie of the year no way.."
2,Quick delivery but extra for shipping,"The delivery was fast, but I had to pay my mailman an extra $0.51 because the sender didn't put the proper postage on the package. I could care less about the $0.51. It is the principle of the sender trying to say a few cents that bugs me, especially when they offer the lowest price by a few cents. Be careful buying from this person."
1,Are You Kidding Me,This movie is a piece of garbage. If all the writers think this is great they must be as messed up as the director. PS who wants to read sub titles all night.
1,no good to me,"the supplier lied to me.. i asked if the movie had (closed caption) he wrote that it did.. he lied it does not have closed caption.. would have sent it back but did not have the shipping label o anything. and did not want to put up with the hassle.. i just will not order any more movies on line.. im deaf, and can not use a movie without cc lou"
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed with my product. The DVD did not work or play in my Blue Ray Disc Player, and it was a gift for my brother, which turned out to be a let down."
2,Not so good like Quentin's other movies,This movie is strange! I expected high on quentin's new one. But I don't like it so much.Con:1. The story totally wrong! The world war II didn't be ended in the movie theatre.2. It's too bloody.3. The screenplay is not reasonable.Good:1. The actors are great2. The photography is good
1,Slow,"I can't believe all the good ratings on this movie, just finished watching it and I must say it was slow and boring through the whole thing. What a waste of time."
1,Unrealistic Irrelevant Garbage. No More Tarantino,"I officially give up on Tarantino. This movie was remarkably bad, it was hard to follow, and showed little creativity. If one knows nothing about history or the epic struggle that was World War 2, you might be entertained. Pitt is a good actor but his role in this seemed forced and contrived. This film was not worth making or watching. Don't waste your time."
1,Disappointed,"Flashes of brilliance held together with needless gore and confusing, splotched together scenes. Immediately threw the movie into the trash when it was over...wanted to several times during the movie but a brilliant scene appeared and drew me in again. I should mention the flashes of brilliant acting did not pertain to Brad Pitt but Christoph Waltz as the SS Colonel."
1,do you abuse small animals? watch this movie,Im not trying to bash the seller of this disk set im sure its perfect.The movie on the other hand....was a absolute disaster i cannot believe the ratings exceeded 1/5the ENTIRE movie was pure GORE and more gore the directors attempts of humor i didnt even notice i was so horrified at the gore in this movie.i mind as well get front row seats to a woodchipper and watch babies get thrown in there for nearly 2 hours. the movie only had one part where i so much as grinned when brad pit was speaking Italian and had to repeat his name over and over again.other than that this movie was just another bloodbath flick that should have gotten ripped off the sets.i guess you may like it if you enjoy tearing small animals apart while they scream or some intense woodchipper action theres no reason to even give this movie a chance.
2,A disappointing so-called war movie from Tarentino,"I walked out of the theatre after about an hour of this film by Quentin Tarentino because after seeing such WWII films like ""Defiance"" and ""Valkyrie"", it lacked authencity. It seems that Tarentino basically gathered every cliche that he has seen in much better films like ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Underground"" (an obscure film with Cornel Wilde), etc.--and thrown in a blender and out comes this monstrosity. I even gave the film a second try on Blu-ray and still despite the favorable reviews, changed my opinion of this film. The film lacks suspense and Tarentino over does it in the dialogue department--allowing a scene to go on much longer than it needs to be. Christoph Waltz's performance as the evil Nazi is perhaps the only saving grace in this disappointing film."
1,Inglorious Movie,This movie was horrible. The story was ok but the acting was amateurish. I knew it was going to be bad when I saw Brad Pitt hold his jaw at a strange angle to attempt to look strong or threatening. I can not understand how or why he or the movie was ever nominated for an Oscar.
1,Nothing to See Here,"OK, the opening sequence is ""masterful."" However, the rest of the movie is awful, boring, poorly constructed, poorly acted... oh well, you get the point. If Quentin Tarantino hadn't been involved in this turkey, no one would pay it any attention at all, except maybe for several razzies. We don't learn anything in the movie, and it isn't even entertaining. Your time on the planet is limited. Don't spend it watching this piece of garbage!"
3,It is too violent.,I don't mind blood but the ending is just too much for me. The movie twisted historic facts and I am wondering if the director was high on crack when he made the movie.
3,Digital Copy Not Usable,"The DVD arrived with a Digital Copy as advertised, but missing the insert with the activation code. Without the code you can't make a digital copy. I returned the discs and received a replacement, but that too was missing the insert! I just spoke to Amazon customer service and was informed that the digital copy capability expired in 2010. That would have been nice to know before I purchased the DVD! But there is no indication of this on the product page which still advertises a 2 disc special edition!"
2,Exploritory Surgery,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder....so they say! I guess this applies to movies as well. While many may claim this is a great movie I digress otherwise. It's slow paced, poorly acted, and comes across as being somewhat pretentious. The only part of this movie that I did enjoy was the part played by Diane Kruger (Troy)and the twist of her character's appearance. Other than that this movie is one that should be placed on life support. Tarantino's only GOOD movie was ""Pulp Fiction"" which is a classic. This stinker is no where close to being a good movie let alone a classic."
2,Painfully Boring,"In my opinion this director is absurdly overated. A movie that is 99% dialogue is not what I call entertaining. I don't care if that dialogue is masterfully clever(To me it is ridiculous). There are some cool scenes but they feel like teases in an otherwise bore fest. If the movie were entertaining and it wasn't all talking at a table, it would make up for the fact that it is a joke insult to good WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan. Unfortunately it is a boring joke. I wasted my money buying this movie outright. I don't undertsand why this movie was at all popular and I resent how I was mislead by bad taste."
2,"Boring, artsy, and in subtitles","The film is mostly in French or German with subtitles (and reading them gets to be a chore REAL quickly). What's worse, Quentin Tarantino tries to go art noir with this film and (unlike in Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill) fails to pull it off. What's supposed to be new and artistic just comes off as weird and boring. Tarantino severely curtails the amount of action and gore that normally suffice for someone who just doesn't click with his quirky style of writing and directing. The movie was portrayed in advertisements as Tarantino turning the tables on history and having the movie be essentially a two hour gore-filled, splatterfest fantasy of Jews terrorising Nazies. We were lied to, and we want those two hours of our lives back."
2,Tedious and Silly,"I can't help but ask if Quentin has contempt for his audience. This over-long exercise in silliness would lead one to think so.Yes, the ""Jew Hunter"" is a great character and well done, but Brad Pitt is horrendous. And what is with the comic book captions? I heard about the failed ""Tavern Scene"" a long time ago, and would agree with most critics that was one of the movie's bottoms.This was the first Tarantino movie I have seen since Jackie Brown, and regret wasting my time on this joke of a film. Pulp Fiction will always be one of my favorites, but is Tarantino turning into our generation's Orson Welles?I can forgive Tarantino for poor editing, but my wife will never forgive me for making her sit through this narcissistic exercise in gore and poor acting.My tip -- if you are curious, hang on to the remote and fast forward through the tediousness. I think one can watch a accelerated version in about 45 minutes."
5,Fun Movie,"Loved the action and the movie kept moving the whole time. Pitt was pretty convincing, he pronounced Maynardville, TN authentically, (its tough to do)."
2,Iglourius Basterds should have been better,"While there were several very good performances in this movie and some memorable scenes overall the film was very slow and way too long. The movie is based on a fantasy and at times is so thoroughly unbelievable to the point that I felt like I was watching a cartoon spoof flick. The movie could have used an injection of humor, with the subject matter this would have been a much more enjoyable film if it hadn't taken itself so seriously. Brad Pitt's portrayal of the commander of the Jewish comandos was the only part of the movie that hinted at humor and it was unintentional. Looking back at all of the WW II movies over the last 50 years fictional or not this film rates fairly low in my book. That is a shame, it could have been much better."
4,Brutally Raw,Weak stomach? Cant handle violence? Buy a chic flick or a comedy... It is a great movie. Just buy it.
2,"Surprised, how bad","The first chapter of the movie was well acted but it went down very fast in subsequent chapters. I could not believe that movies like this one are produced. It was a waste of money, film, and acting. Do not waste your time it's not worth it. I am convinced that when they advertise a movie, you know it not worth viewing."
1,A movie that's just as bad as the spelling,"I'm not a big Tarantino fan to begin with, but my one star is not because of his direction. It's simply not as good as the original made in 1978 staring Bo Svenson. If you haven't seen this version, do so, you'll probably agree with me. I can't knock the other reviewers who gave it high praise because everyone is entitled to their opinion. I say, to each his/her own."
5,QT brings back the Classic Movie. Brilliant.,"This movie is simply brilliant. I am blown away by QTs movies but this is by far his best. QT is the master at creating tension in scenes to the point you think everything is about to burst. And it does. With great satisfaction. Inglorious Basterds is a remake but really it's a QT movie. And QT brings an instant classic to film. Based in WW2 before the US invasion. Jewish american's gurilla force is used to scare the germans. There is amazing blood and gore in this film. And the acting, dialog and action are fantastic. There is not one dull moment in this movie and you will be on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. And when it's over you will stand up and litearly applaud. I did and I was alone in my living room. Bravo QT. Bravo."
3,Wishful thinking of the past,"All I can say is buyerr beware, it really was not that good. It was very much wishful thinking and bit over the top in violents. I do not mind violents if serving a point, but in this film it kinda was just stupid. I guess if your into history and you like films to be realiztic this is not one of them. No way were the Nazxi this stupid and americans so smart in such small number."
4,A twisted alternate history of WW II,"The humor is very dark, even more so than other Tarantino films so not everyone's cup of tea but for the rest of us this is a great film and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of his other work.I especially like Christoph Waltz and would love to see him in more films."
3,The Point,"I finally figured out what Tarantino was trying to say in his satirical way. ""This is [NOT] the face of Jewish vengance"" although it could be or ""should"" be - no the Jewish people are forgiving, unracist (for the most part), and still contribitute to society. The point is that perhaps this attitude of vengance could be justified; but that is not the face of the Jew today."
2,Don't waste your hard earned money on this dribble.,"I was shocked how totally boring this movie was, Tarantino seems to be getting worse since Jackie brown, long drawn out pointless dialogue, followed by cheesy Tarantino ""done before comedy"", and hardly any action.Rent it for a buck from Redbox, 0r pick it up from the Pawn shop for $2.00, thats where I got my copy."
2,Not really that good.,"I don't see what all the hype is about. In every scene it seemed to take too long to get to the conclusion. I don't mind the subtitles and all that, but the first 20 min is just 2 guys sitting there talking(Snore).It really wasn't that funny either. there were a couple of lines in the whole movie, and that's about it. Mike Meyers can't seem to get away from his Austin Powers character, and for a war movie he just doesn't seem to fit in.How Quentin Tarantino got to be a director I will never know."
3,it was ok,"I heard high reviews for this movie, and though that I would get it and watch it. I was not happy with the turn out of the movie and yes we all wish Hitler had died that but that was not the case. I am give it 4 stars for the action, but over all the plot I would have to give it a 2 1/2 stars."
3,Only good the 25% of the movie,"The start and the end of the movie are really good, speciallythe scens at the theatre, where all nazi leaders are killed.The remaining time between start and end of the movie totally sucks,a complete waste of time. I suggest you fastforward those scenesuntil you reach the theatre scenes."
2,Not the best,"I did not care for this movie at all. It was boring and did not hold my interest at all. My husband said he would give it a 2 and that he liked it a little bit more than me. I have heard that it is a total guy flick so I am thinking that part might be right. I did not care for the story line or the characters. Certain scenes were dragged out way more than they needed to be, losing my interest on a lot of the movie. I wish I would not have wasted the money I spent because we will never watch it again. I would recommend renting it before buying."
3,"Okay, for Tarantino","The movie is well crafted, but the signature Tarantino's stand offs get long and tedious pretty quickly. Lots of blah blah, and little Tarantino's gruesome, nice violence.Also, Brad is quite bad here, not sure what was he thinking when he got this role and played it like that."
2,So so,"Really wasn't plausible, and needed a lot to make this a great recommendation. Would not put this in any of the movies I would recommend to a friend."
4,Definitely worth your time,"If you are deciding to watch this movie based on the reviews, don't read the bad ones. Let me first tell you that if you are NOT a Quentin Tarantino fan, more-than-likely, you will not like this. Clearly, the bad reviews are written by those who are presumably NOT Tarantino fans! Understand, this is his movie and with that comes an added, yet, to-be-expected, twist, or a unique point of view! I, myself, am a fan and loved this movie. If you liked Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and so on...you will like this. Love it? Not sure of, that's for you to find out. It's very entertaining and puts an interesting view on WWII, and a very likely plot. This movie is definitely worth watching AND purchasing."
4,"We in the Nazi Killin' Business, and Business is a Boomin'","This movie is defiantly worth spending some money on. The only 3 bad ideas about it is that if you have not seen a Quentin Tarantino movie it might be slightly awkward. Secondly, the movie is very gory, so viewer's discretion is advised. Finally, how the movie ends is not at all factual, which might bother historians. Other than that this movie is extremely funny, interesting, well performed, well shot, and a great story. The three cons about it are so minuscule, and should only be extra information about it, not a reason to pass up on the opportunity to watch the movie. In parts, the movie could have been better, but that is Quentin Tarantino's style, and besides, no movie is perfect. To even put it up to that standard means it must have been a great movie. In Summary, if you spend any money on movies, this should be at least one of them."
2,Tarantino's made better.,"Let's start off by saying the picture and sound quality of this blu ray movie is pretty fantastic, not reference quality but it looks and sounds great.Without giving anything away, the movie is basically a fantasy vendetta film against the Nazis that requires some serious suspension of disbelief in the execution of a grand plan to assassinate Hitler and other Nazi VIPs. Regardless, I'm still looking for Tarantino to put something out that was as satisfying as Kill Bill: Vol 2 on the visual and story level. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this film, I wasn't able to."
2,I guess I'm a dumb basterd,"The movie is a pointless, and often boring, fantasy. Much of the the acting is sub-par, except for the guy playing the brilliant/repulsive/charming SS officer. I realize many Tarantino fans found it ""brilliant"", but that assemsment escapes me. Now I DO like Tarantino's work, but when this one was over all I could think of is ""THAT was it?"".I guess I'm too dumb to ""get it"". But then again, I don't feel obliged to be that smart."
2,bad movie,"The movie is alright, but just to mush damm subtitles. do way with that and you get a good movie."
3,Brad Pitt ruins the film,"As an actor Brad Pitt sucks. He plays the same part in all films, and in this one, tried to pull off a southern accent. Not good. QT can only make a statement with violence, which shows his limitations all too well."
2,Not What I Expected!,"As the DVD package it is excellent. But, as a movie weak! A warm'd over ""Dirty Dozen""! And this is coning from a person who love's both the ""Dirty Dozen"" & all of Quentin Tarantino's work (so far). I guess I was expecting more form this than it is...Only buy if you must..."
5,excellent movie,This movie was exactly what i thought it would be.thanks for the great and fast service. i will do morebusiness with you
5,Really liked it,"Moves at a good speed, stays on point, and keeps the idea of the fantasy of the war prevalent. I'll watch it again and again."
4,"Government and religion cannot suppress all the ""basterds""....","I think this film is intended as a warning against the Christian fascism that has currently taken over so much of our country, especially during the Bush admistration.All the scenes about scalping, what the Indians did when the white man took them over, were intended to show what the Jews (wish they did?) when the Nazis took them over. What they did in fantasy, through a movie. What will happen to modern-day Nazis if they try it again....It is impossible to miss the parallels between some of our current far-right politicians and far-right religious leaders and the fascists strutting around in their uniforms covered with crosses, so arrogant, unwilling to be told ""no"" by a woman, getting what they wanted through fear, intimidation, and manipulation.It reminds me of Sylvia Plath talking about how ""Every woman loves a Nazi""--- until they see what is going on, that is.Brad Pitt was great; he reminded me of Clark Gable."
1,Quintin Taranitino you buggery bastard,"I want my money back.Seriously.Put it this way.The best thing of the movie is Brad Pitt and he's only, I repeat, ONLY in 10% of the movie and probably says under 100 words total. Even the slaying of Hitler wasn't that good.Oh sure they pumped him full of lead and then some more, I know he's Hitler, but he's barely portrayed as evil other than the fact that he's given the status of being Hitler. So it was rather neutral to see him die.I wish a brought a book or gameboy or something to play through most of the movie. only in the last 20 minutes did ANYthing really happen.I was ready to walk out had I not been so blocked into my seat at the theater."
3,its ok,I have had better there are very good puzzles in the book. The problem is that there is not much room to write in answears at all and its all just writting no clour aside from the titie and the answears are between each section. Im used to them being at the rear of the book so at first I thought they where other puzzles but instead its the puzzle rewritting with the answear printed on top. A reprinting of the entire puzzle instead of just the solution is a waste of space in my eyes that could have been used for at least 30% more puzzles and teasers in the book.
5,Work your brain,"This is a great book for brain exercises. I bought it for my husband, but our college-age children actually enjoyed it more! They challenged each other to solve the puzzles and made a little competition out of going through the entire book."
2,Mediocre puzzle book,"This puzzle book is on the mediocre side - there are very few puzzles overall, and no original content. It's just some puzzles the author has collected over time."
5,Used on the Porsche 914.,"This is an excellent book containing a detailed description of the L-jetronic fuel injection system. This fuel system has been used on lots of automobiles from the 1970's and 1980's. I personally own a vintage Porsche 914, and this book really helped me understand what was actually going on behind the scenes of my fuel delivery system. The first chapter discussed the 4 stroke internal combustion process, which I am sure if you are reading this you probably have an understanding yourself, but after that, you get into the ""nuts and bolts"" of the fuel system including the strategy it takes to achieve fuel control without the use of a ""closed loop"" system. I recommend this book to anyone with an L-jetronic fuel injection system!!"
2,American Salon,This magazine is for those that are interested in runway and high-end salons...it didn't do much for me.
5,Strongly recommended,"The book holds the hand of the naif reader from the very first page to the end, when the reader is no longer a naif one but a good practitioner. Very good examples and exercises. Few of listed features regarding some searching engines are no longer up-to-date (as in Altavista or Google, just to mention a few) but this is quite inevitable for a book published in 2003.If I can suggest an improvement to the author: provide web exempla too from non-English speaking countries as France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It could enlarge even more the number of readers."
5,Great book for some advanced topics in Java,"I recommend strongly to buy this book. It covers perfectly the majority of advanced stuff in Java. It's really well written, accurate and rich. It will allow you to feel the power of Java repecting Networking, Object distribution, Beans, Data connectivity, Wrapping, and so on. After reading this book you will feel Java as a real programming tools as C++, and other. So much advanced concepts within just one book, I never saw that ..."
5,The best bootstrap I have seen.,"After reading these two volumes (Core Java 1.1 vol. I&II), only hands-on experience will truly add anything.I have managed to go from interested sparetime testing to implementing full-fledged solutions in just two weeks after-work studying by reading them. H&C manage to cover the area in fair depth from syntax to some fine details of imaging, streams and beans. They do it with a fresh air of distance to the subject, where critisism or applause is in place, they give it.The large number of examples provides an invaluable source when you are about to implement your own solutions.I will recommend these titles for our inhouse Java training to come."
2,"Ironically, doesn't work with Mac Mini","Despite the name, this doesn't work with my Mac Mini, which apparently keeps some residual power to the USB ports even when it's asleep.Yes, asleep -- not turned off. Most Mac owners take advantage of the machine's good sleep circuitry and the OS's fast wake, and rarely turn the machine off. Unfortunately, this totally defeats the purpose of the power minder. Alas."
2,Sutherland way below par,"I don't know if any of the people who gave this performance a 5 star even heard this. I am a huge fan of La Stupenda, and I think she had an off day here. The high notes were very, very shaky and bad for that period - 1959. She certainly, in 1959 had the capability to sing up a storm. She became the toast of the operatic world, of course, because of a performance of Lucia that is perhaps just days before this one. But I guess maybe she was sick here. Really, get the set Sutherland/Cioni that was made in 1960. That Lucia is shere perfection."
3,"It's Good, But Hollow","When I first heard this CD at a listening booth in Sydney's Red Eye Records, I thought Hot-Damn this stuff rocks. The whole new-rock revival started with the 70s and then moved off into the 60s and 80s but no one bothered doing any renaissance work on the old 50s rockabilly.The first few songs appeared to be so much fun, tunes you could tap your foot to and cause you to slap your knee sporadically with pleasure. I finally bought the CD and gave it a whirl a few times and really enjoyed it. But then it started to ring really hollow. None of these songs have any real staying power.So in conclusion, this album is a bit of fun, wrench as much enjoyment as you can get out of it and then leave at the back of your collection to accrue a thick, impenetrable skin of dust. Maybe in a couple of years you might excavate it during a spring clean, or house move and give it a couple of extra spins."
5,VERY GOOD CONSTRUCTION.,"I was concerned that the construction would be cheap, but just the opposite. This V Bar weights a ton. I was surprised how heavy and well made it is. It compares to any that you would by at the gym and the price is excellent. I would highly recommend this one a lot. I really like it."
5,Pushing Down,"A good inexpensive tri-cep bar. Solid and sturdy piece of equipment. Champion Barbell makes durable products. So if you're in the market for one of these, then this is the one."
2,Went flat,"We only had the Volleyball for a month and couldn't figure out why it alway felt flat...finally figured out that one of the seems on the volleyball had a crack. Now the volleyball wont keep any air in it all all. The leather on the volleyball was great quality, just how they put the volleyball together wasnt very good."
5,Love it!,"It's hard to shop for a volleyball online, because all of them look the same. So, I did a little research first and talked to friends who play and checked what they used. I like the lighter, less-padded volleyballs that have a ""pop"" when you hit them. This is exactly that.It took a couple of uses before it softened up some, but significantly less time that most. I've had it for several years now and it's still my favorite game ball."
5,Awesome,I got a great price and free shipping on this item. It has helped greatly in developing skills.
5,UNA TRILOGIA POETICAMENTE HERMOSA,El tercer disco de la trilogia que vino a terminar con un cuarto disco.Dominguez es excepcional y fantastico.Es interesante y poetico.Es termendo y amoroso.EsUtopico y Real...Silvio hace estremecer y sin duda alguna Domiguez estremece.
5,A fantastic read,"Probably not the book for a professional photographer, however, I'm not a professional and Michael Herron didn't write this book for professionals. I just want to take great looking shots of my toddler and this book is fantastic in telling me how. I now understand about aperture, f/stops, shutter speed, light and the relevance of ISO. I have enjoyed reading this book and found a lot of my beliefs about photography were false, I never realised the pros took a heap of shots until they got that one they wanted! This book has taught me all the basics I need to know and helped to build my confidence to be able to take great shots. Thanks for such a wonderful book Michael Herron!"
2,Disappointing,"Recently bought this to replace a 4-year old battery in my Dell laptop. When new, I used to get almost 3 hours of use, but that had dwindled to about 1/2 hour.So I bought this replacement a few weeks ago and yesterday used the computer for the first time on battery power. I only got about 70 minutes out of it. Luckily I was near my office and was able to get the cord. But if I was working on a plane I would NOT have been happy.Spend the extra $$$ and get a name brand."
1,I have not changed my mind ...,"I am the guy from Gallup that wrote earlier this atlas is near useless.I have not changed my mind.The Benchmark atlas, for the same price, is a much better atlas. Buy it instead."
4,Keep your gazetteer handy!,"I never travel the west without one of these. I just wish this one for New Mexico had contour lines. Otherwise, it's great."
1,AZ and NM Atlases,"I bought both the AZ and NM atlases by Delorme after reading some good reviews of both here at the Amazon site.Being somewhat of a map collector and a backroads enthusiast, both atlases are near useless.My biggest beef is that although many backroads are shown on the atlases, the roads are not identified...."
5,A great help for traveling New Mexico!,An indispensable addition to your travel planning for New Mexico! Buy one and you'll find you'll want more DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteers for traveling in other states!
3,No topo contours,"I have a Tennessee map and it shows the contours with 100 foot intervals. Although this map does give some elevation points, it does not show the contours."
1,mines,"In the past, I have purchased several of the Gazetteer maps. One of the chief reasons I purchase a Topo type map is because I am a Rockhound. A large portion of good minerals and rock formations are generally located at or near mines. The Gazetteer has always been a quick and easy reference for roads and trails to these areas. Not so with the New Mexico version. I have found no mines or quarries anywhere within this map. I feel cheated for if I had looked at it prior to purchase, I would not have bought it."
3,I prefer this one,"Unlike others, I prefer the New Mexico Atlas and Gazetteer over the Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas. The reason is that the gazetteer shows state and federal lands - places where I'm not tresspassing. That's important to me. I carry them both, but the gazetteer gets used."
2,A Step Down...,"Essentially worthless without the topo lines, unless you are simply looking for a common road map with larger print. I can get the same info using a highway map from the gas station. These atlases used to be great: they had all the elevation info, lots of details (mines, trails, ghost towns, etc) for those who travelled into out-of-the-way places on backroads, hiking, biking, off-roading, etc. It seems Delorme has decided to make it simply a giant highway/road/city map. It doesn't make much sense, since we can get those for much cheaper and without carrying around the wasted 71 extra pages. I see the older Delorme Atlas with topo lines is going for $576 used here on Amazon. I wonder why that is? Oh yeah... this version doesn't cut it. Buy the old one if you can find it for under five hundred dollars. :)"
2,Boring......,"I am very much an animal lover, but I was quite disappointed in this book. I expected many more details of the relationship between the author and the parrot, and what I got was a biology textbook. I found it tedious and a little self-absorbed."
2,Chocolate is TOXIC to birds,"While I am enjoying the book so far, I am terribly upset with how the author fed chocolate to her bird.CHOCOLATE IS TOXIC TO BIRDS! As an ornithologist she should have known that. It is also very irresponsible to write about it and have readers perhaps feed it to their birds too.I can't tell you how awful this is that someone who supposedly cares about the health of her bird CHOOSES to fead it a poisonous substance. Totally reprehensible!"
1,"great, if you want to kill your parrot","This woman is misleading thousands of readers as to what's acceptable in terms of rearing a parrot. She very often endangers her bird, everything from feeding it a poor diet to letting it chew on furniture (most have stains and sealants that can be toxic). I also see a lot of people voting these bad reviews down, which is fine, but realize that just because she ""loved"" her bird doesn't mean she did the right things for him. She sure left her other parrots in a rut fast enough."
1,All the birds want me....,"If you're looking for a book with amusing anecdotes about a talking parrot, I wouldn't recommend this book. This parrot does more biting than talking. The inspiration for writing the book appears to be the author's giddy delight that her parrot wants her for a mate, and I frankly could have been spared the details. I wasn't wild about a lot of the other ""scientific"" details the author felt compelled to share, either. For instance, she said her husband's pet cowbird ""would peck vigorously at my foot or wrist, until I raised it to the appropriate position, whereupon he would hop on, wiggle his tail, and deposit a bit of semen."" The author also spends a lot of time talking about her career, which was of no interest to me. It's not the author's fault I was expecting a different kind of book, but I thought there might be others who would want to know a little more about it."
5,The Parrot that Owns Me,"I have purchased this book for many of my friend who own parrots and othe birds. It is an easy read, which gives the reader insight and information on the species not currenly available in the mainstream. At the same time it is interesting and funny. The author is one of the leading experts in parrots with the acedemic credentials to back up her theories and conclusions. If you own any birds or just enjoy the fun of bird watching this is a must read."
4,A PARROT NEEDS MORE ATTENTION THAN A DOG....WOW!,This book is a dandy. This is my first book reading about a pet parrot and it is written by an author who is a professional ornithologist who knows all about birds. Tiko (the bird's name) has changed her professional attitude toward animals in many ways and the understanding between them is just wonderful. Joanna does a fine job in telling her story and after reading this you just might want to get one for yourself...if you have the time to devote. You will wonder after reading of the ways they take care of each other!
5,Great bird book for the uninitiated!,"""The Parrot Who Owns Me"" provides a great way to learn more about birds without having to wade through dense, scientific terminology and obtuse, technical arguments. The book is well-organized, fluid, scenic and emotional-- all the ingredients a beginning bird enthusiast (or a seasoned one) needs to painlessly learn about bird behavior while growing to love and admire the book's subject, the amazing parrot named Tiko."
4,Carmelites :),"It can be a difficult read, but give it time because it is worth it. A priest recommended this to me and it is great. Be sure to highlight key phrases inside...they will help you later in life :)"
4,Understanding Deeper,"I find this book very mind provoking as it delves into topics not all desire to understand. I didn't quite agree with all the concepts but then again everyone is different in their walk, and what they are seeking to understand and learn."
3,"OK, but I got more from the writings of St. Teresa and St. John themselves.","I read the book, looking for insight about the spirituality of St. Theresa and St. John of the Cross. Fr. Dubay helped me to unlock some of that insight. His book also inspired me to read St Theresa's, The Interior Castle and St. John's Dark Night of the Soul. Both of these are more powerful, and don't require another person's interpretation.However, Fr. Dubay also uses his book as a vehicle of instruction for a somewhat orthodox brand of Roman Catholic spirituality and meditation that he advocates. This is fine for readers who are seeking help in grasping and following that brand of spirituality. I wasn't. As with another reviewer, I found this aspect of the book off-putting. This irritant knocked the rating down from five to three stars."
2,Hard to understand ...,I felt that this book is not for the average reader. I found it very difficult to understand. If you are looking for a book to help you understand contemporative prayer ... this isn't it!
2,Detailed but intensely non-ecumenical,"Despite the author's claims that the book isn't intended to be a polemic, it starts off with a curt, even scolding tone that never lets up.Exploration of the spirituality of Teresa in particular is overshadowed by the author's condemnation of spiritual leaders within the Catholic Church who in his opinion misrepresent or fail to promote contemplative prayer, and he never passes up an opportunity to denigrate Eastern meditation approaches and practices - what he calls ""oriental"" versus ""occidental"" - from his intensely Catholic Fundamentalist perspective. This is a great disservice to these inspirational saints whose influence reaches so far beyond one church.If you're looking for a more balanced and universal treatment of the mysticism of St. John of the Cross, I recommend Thomas Merton's ""Counsels of Light and Love of St. John of the Cross"" instead. I'm sure there are much books on St. Teresa's spiritual legacy as well."
1,Friar Dubay a zealot in philosophers' robes,"This is a dogmatic and tedious read for an educated person. Although, I am all for prayer, however, Dubay should stick to what he knows and stop shooting his mouth off about what he knows little of. He disparging comments on other faiths and philosophies without thorough education in their doctrines is shameful for a man of his position and shows embassingly his ignorance of such matters. It amazes me that he still hasn't figured out that there is no self-denial in detachment. And, only shows he has a ways to travel on the infinately wide road that leads to GOD."
5,Want to really understand the life of prayer?,"This book is a phenomenal introduction to some of the best writers of the spiritual life--John of the Cross and his contemporary Theresa of Avilla. This book will give everyone a clear, susinct, insight into these giants of spirituality whose writings have stood the test of time. The book discusses their lives, and their writings and compares it to the gospel understanding. The author, DuBay, rightly concludes that EVERYONE is called to be a mystic! Then explains what that process is! A msut read for anyone who wants to grow in their relationship to God!"
2,Not formatted properly for kindle and has watermarks throughout it.,"I'm writing this review before I've actually read this book, and the review is specifically for the Kindle edition of this book.I'm reading this on the new Kindle Touch and the layour of the text is all wrong. Lists don't appear correctly, there is no defined Table of Contents and there is a watermark ""A Playbook for Skyrocketing Your Commissions"" randomly scattered throughout the book.If you're going to go to the effort of selling your book as an e-book, at least get the formatting correct."
4,Very good on the basics,"This is a real practical and realistic book to read when you either need to refresh your skills, or if you're first getting into sales. It's a good reference for the fundamentals of sales."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Countess in the junkyard.It isn't often noblewomen types hang out at secondhand stuff places, but here you have it. An estate, apparently, has sold off stuff to Jupiter Jones' uncle, and wants it back.The mystery in this hunt for stuff is a picture of a house, smaller on each item."
3,Flip-flop necklace,"The necklaces were really pretty, (I got the flower one and the plain one) but the chain on the plain one broke after wearing it only once! Although the pendant was gorgeous, the chain didn't exactly hold up."
3,good but too expensive,"wow, i love flip flop necklaces, so when i saw these i was so happy. But when i saw the thing for 15 dollars i was like, no. I have a flip flop necklace but it broke, and i got it for 9 dollars. they are great, but too expensive. thanks"
5,An incredible CD,"This is a joyful, uplifting, inspiring CD. The combination of the powerful singing of Theresa Thomason and the incredible musicianship of Paul Halley makes this a ""must have"" CD."
1,Exxon Gas Station No. 2586,"I bought this for my grandsons. They like to play with hotwheels, filling them up at the gas station. The specification for this toy is for the box and not the actual toy. It's much to small for their use."
5,ONE ON HIS FAVORITES,"I ONCE KNEW DOUG FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS, AND WHEN HE RECORDED THIS LP HE WAS SO PROUD OF IT, HE FELT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS BEST WORKS, AND ONE LISTEN AND I HAD TO AGREE. I KNOW ONE CAN NOT ACHIEVE PERFECTION, BUT IF YOU TRY YOU CAN ACHEIVE EXCELLENCE, AND IN MY OPINION THATS WHAT WAS DONE HERE ON ""JUKE BOX MUSIC""-------- LOVE YA, DOUG SEE YOU IN THE HERE AFTER!"
3,"Good for me, OK for my son...","I thought the quality and price on these vitamins were great. When my son first tried them, however, he said he did not like the flavor that much, yet he has no complaints consuming them every morning."
3,An Interesting Read,"What an interesting little book! Some of the predictions made in 1892 are incredibly accurate while some missed the mark a wee bit. My favorite is that in 2000, all wars in Europe are decided by a game of golf. If only! This was entertaining enough for me to start and finish it on the same day."
5,A Very Spiritual CD!,"I have listened to both CDs of Padre Marcelo, and I enjoyed them both greatly! My mother introduced me to them, and now I listen to them every day for spiritual guidance. You will never get tired of listening to them, and singing along with the songs is a Prazer!"
4,cheese,I TOOK A CHANCE ON GETTING CHEESE THROUGH THE INTERNET BUT ONCE I TRIED IT I WAS VERY PLEASED IT WAS VERY TASTY AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL!!!!!
5,The songs are terrific,"I had an opportunity to purchase this CD while on vacation in Nashville, and it's fabulous. I listen to it over and over and never tire of it. Since I didn't see the movie, I don't know how this collection stacks up to the original sound track, but it really doesn't matter -- I like pop/country and all the songs are great and well performed!"
4,Childhood memories,"I owned this CD when I was a child, and loved it so much. I lost my original copy ages ago, and was feeling nostalgic. The songs are just like I remember them. The CD arrived quickly, with just minimal damage to the case and barely noticeable scratches. These scratches are so minuscule that they don't affect the music in any way. Thank you."
5,very good compilation of country music artists,"I choice this rating a 5 because very good songs, a compilation of country music singers, vince gill, the judds, etc, my best one i love is the charlie daniels song the very last one"
5,I would like more samples of this cd,I like this cd but havent purchased it yet and would like to hear some more samples of this.
5,This CD is wonderful.,My daughter-in-law and I have become addicted to this CD. We listen to it constantly. The songs are inspiring. Each week I have a new favorite.
4,"Excellent CD, with lots of music from Country's Best",I got hooked by catching the videos which talk about the project itself. Several inspirational pieces which are Great!! My favorites include: . I give you to his heart . Once in awhile . Goodspeed . Somewhere down the road
3,Somewhere Down The Road - Grant's is better than Faith's,"If you like Somewhere Down The Road on here, you should check out Amy Grant's version... Grant sang it first and co-wrote it, it's on her ""Behind The Eyes"" album, and was released on Christian radio as a single back in '97. Faith's is pretty good, but a bit overdone and oversung, Grant's is perfect, check it out! Faith also sang another song that Amy wrote, although I'm not sure what it is."
1,"I would have called it ""Merchandising Moses"" .....................","There were 3 cds called ""The Prince Of Egypt"" released as movie tie-ins. I have only heard the Nashville one, but I think 3 cds takes merchandising greed too far. There are some great artists performing here, but unfortunately all the songs sound manufactured to order, rather than inspired by deep feelings. After all, how likely is it that so many country music writers and performers would all have a Moses moment in their lives at the same time?"
3,Puro Hometown Boys,This album of the HOMETOWN BOYS is an excelent choice because it has a variety of Joe Martinez's acorrdion talents also with the super conjuto style music
2,THIS IS NOT THE MICHAEL CONNOLLY WE KNOW,"What a disappointment following on from The Poet and Trunk Music. This has to be Connolly's least effective novel yet. It lacks the atmosphere and suspense of previous novels and the conclusion seems fabricated and rushed, giving an overall impression of an overrated read from a more capable author."
4,A new Connelly Hero!,"A new hero in Blood Works by Michael Connelly! And Terry McCaleb is just that--a former FBI profiler whose vast knowledge of serial killers is at the heart of this suspenseful novel. Living on a boat in the Los Angeles area, McCaleb is living in retirement following a very recent heart transplant. A visit from Gracielea Rivers changes his relaxed daily routine into an intense search for the vicious murderer of Graciela's sister, Glory. With much opposition from the police and FBI, as well as from his doctor, and several false starts, road blocks, and dead ends, McCaleb pursues the killer.Looking at the LAPD paperwork and crime scene tapes, McCaleb is sure that law enforcement came to wrong conclusions. Enough said at the risk of giving away any of the twists and turns that make this novel so suspenseful and make this character one that we hope to meet up with again."
2,Pick another MC's book,MC can write awfully better than this. I bought this book because I wanted to relax and read a good thriller and I got uneasy and bored. The main story is OK if and only if you can find it along its pages. The story has overly loopholes that it could be a strainer.
4,My first Connnelly,"I just could not put this book down. I liked the orderly way ,step by step,Connelly wrote. It was easy to read. It kept my attention to the end. It was fast paced. It wasnot like so many books that start out and have to catch at the end."
4,Random or not?,"If you enjoy reading dramatic & intense police thrillers, than you'll like this one. It packs in the suspense. Just when you think you have it figured out, it takes you on a more intense ride. You will be so engrossed that you will find it hard to put it down. Mr. Connelly's background as a crime reporter seeps through the pages from beginning to end. You get just enough to keep you holding on. I felt as if I was a little mouse in Terry McCaleb's pocket the whole ride. Michael Connelly takes his understanding of the criminal mind and puts it on paper very well. I enjoyed this thriller so much that I'm anxious to start on the next one. You won't feel as if you've wasted your money on Michael Connelly, that's for sure."
4,Better than the movie -- a well woven story,"I saw the movie before reading the book, but this didn't spoil the book for me. The two differ enough, and, as is often the case, the book is better. I lost myself in the reading as I followed the twists and turns. I couldn't wait to finish, but when I finished, I wished I had more to read.The characters and the plot are very well developed. Factual information about medicine, law enforcement, ... provide additional interest without slowing the story. The ending isn't disappointing, but it may not feel right to you. Endings are hard.This is a mystery with action, suspense and love. This read is awesome."
5,Great book,"This is my first Connelly book I have read. I loved this one. I will look forward to another Terry McCaleb book and other Connelly books as well as watching the movie based on this book featuring Clint Eastwood, one of my favorite actors."
5,Great Book!,This was a Christmas present for my mom who reads all of Michael Connelly books! She read it quickly and loved the story line.
3,Convoluted,Forced my self to finish ths one. Not one of his better books. Always look forward to reading his books. Disappointed this time.
3,"Good from far, far from good","Michael Connolly has turned generic in his very average Blood Work novel. Previous offerings had me anxiously awaiting this recent text. After finishing the book I wondered Why did I bother? The ending was lacking from Connolly's usual standards. The worst thing about a book in this genre is the ability to easily put it down. I put it down a lot. Blood Work was a decent read, with a ho-hum plot. We want Harry Bosch back along with Michael's cunning ability to entertain us. Back to the days when I could not put down a Michael Connolly novel if tried."
1,One too many cliches,"Michael Connolly, where have you gone wrong? I shelled out[this kind of money] for this book and had to shelve it from something written with intelligence, with style, with something new. The plot is ludicrous and the characters have been cut from cardboard. They just don't jive. They don't breathe. Save yourself the trouble, don't buy it."
1,Not his best,I have read all of Michael Connolly's book and this was a great disappointment. The characters lacked character and the dialogue was dull. It was a plod of a read.
3,Not catching.......,I could never really get into this book. I found it too monotone. Needed more action and versitlity. Disappointed.
1,Connellys first DUD,"This is a very boring book. I read it just 2weeks ago and Ican't even remember what it was about.I have read all his books except ""The Poet"" and this was THE ONLY DUD. ""Trunk Music"" is his best."
4,Enjoyed my first Michael Connelly Book,"Blood Work was a fun and thrilling read. There were enoughtwists to keep me turning the pages, and the characters were well developed. I'm looking forward to reading some other Connelly boo ks."
4,"Good read, but not ""The Poet""","I loved the first 3/4ths of this book. Piecing together the clues was great and the process of tracking the killer left me riveted. Then all of a sudden the book ended. The last part seemed like an entirely different book. Getting the killer seemed much too easy, after all the effort of finding who it was. Otherwise the premise was excellent and I would still recommend it. However, if you have not read Connelly before, this would not be the best first start."
4,Enjoyable Suspense,"Michael Connelly can make characters come to life as few other authors can. I'm a big fan of his Harry Bosch stories and was afraid I would be disappointed in this new character, Terry McCaleb, but that wasn't the case. McCaleb was interesting and likeable. The plot was intricate and well put together. And, although the conclusion was pretty far-fetched, it didn't detract from an enjoyable read."
2,Disappointing; not up to his usual finesse.,"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite mystery writers, so I was doubly disappointed in ""Blood Work"". The characters are one-dimensional, the plot borders on the implausible, and I had figured out ""who did it"" by the third chapter. Plus, despite all the warnings about not stressing his transplanted heart, our hero escapes with no physical consequences. Perhaps the publisher insisted he churn out another bestseller - this has a churned-out feel."
3,Good Connelly writing but...,"As usual, Mr. Connelly shows his mastery of suspense. It is fast paced and it kept me reading at all hours... The finish is somewhat disappointing, though. The lead up could have been better done. For instance, maybe go back in time and in better detail about the work that Terry made before his operation. Overall, the novel is well written."
3,"Even Steven; No peaks, no valleys","I really like Michael Connelly and have read most all of his Kindle editions and a few paperback. Bloodwork introduced new characters and new story lines that left me engaged but not thrilled. He kept an ""even strain"" of tension throughout the book that I found a bit boring because I am used to ACTION, detail, ACTION sequences with Bosch and Haller. It just was different and unexpected. I would still say I liked it: it was a drive through the valley, not a ride on a fire truck."
2,Glad I got it for free from a friend,"I read several of Connelly's books. I enjoyed The Poet but havebeen disapointed by the rest.On the positive side, Connelly has a great way with explaining investigative procedures-probably due to his background in journalism.On the minus side, the plot was pretty predictable with one or two interesting twists. If you've read some of Connelly's other books you may even be able to predict the twists.I would have forgiven the plot if the characters had been more interesting and less one-dimensional. It seemed like they were there simply to carry the plot and technical details. If you want a fast read and an OK story, this book is fine. If you also want some compelling characters, I would recommend checking out James Elroy or early Lawrence Sanders."
2,Interesting at first...till you learn the motive,"This book had a lot of potential at first. (without giving too much away here.) The motive for the killing was headed in a direction that could have been very interesting. However, once you learn the real motive, your left wondering why Connelly thinks it is even interesting because its really not. It seems Connelly thinks his detective is too important not to make him part of the story. Very disappointed in the end. Since this is the first Connelly i have read, i will think seriously before i pick up another."
3,"Above average, but Terry McCaleb ain't no Harry Bosch.","What a thrill to find that Michael Connelly is only a fine mystery writer and not the paragon that his earlier writings led us to believe him to be. Blood Work is better than most mysteries, but at last, Connelly has written a book that you can put down. Retired FBI man Terry McCaleb is not the keen mind that we found in The Poet's reporter and he certainly is no Harry Bosch. Blood Work is good, and if you're used to reading Cornwell, Patterson, Dunning, or Burke; you'll find the twists and turns fascinating and the story moving and readable. If you're used to Harry Bosch, plan to be disappointed because you'll see the plot long before it gets there. It's better than the average mystery, and addresses a societal issue that shows Connelly's learning and search for knowledge. This is definitely Connelly's weakest writing. Bring back Harry Bosch!"
3,"Okay, but slow in spots.","This is the first book I have read by Michael Connelly and I would probably read another, despite this one dragging in places. It really never took off for me, but I kept reading, as it was kind of interesting. It was not great I didn't think, and the way the bad guy was ultimately located was pretty lame. I kind of liked the way the relationship between McCaleb and Graciela developed. Buddy was great. Buddy was also kind of a minor character as was Jaye Winston, who could have had a lot more to do with the ultimate resolution than she did. I've read lots of thrillers. This one wasn't one of the top notch thillers but it was a pretty good mystery. The end was awfully flat."
5,My first Connelly book. What fun!,I picked this book up on Friday and almost finished it bySunday night (that's with an all day family reunion on Saturday and laundry all day Sunday). I forced myself to to put it down at midnight Sunday and I can't wait to get back to it tonight to finish. I'm not a literary critic but I can say this has been a great read. The elements of the plot eek out a little at a time...just enough to keep you glued to the page waiting for the next development. I'm looking forward to reading the other Connelly books which I bought at the same time.
3,"medically inaccurate, but entertaining & quick read","Shame on the author for not checking out the medical details;as a heart transplant physician who likes to unwind by reading fiction, I got this from a patient ----no, transplant patients don't have to wait a year to drive, and biopsies are not taken from the carotid artery of the neck---despite this, it was a fun book to read"

4,Interesting read,"This is a well written, exciting book. Lots of small detailsget wrapped up nicely in the end, however I thought that the ending itself could have been better. It seemed as though the bad guy was tracked down a little too easily. Overall, a very good book that I would recommend."
2,Blood Work,"I didn't realize this was the Abridged version of the book Blood Work. It is only 3 hours long, whereas the unabridged version is 12 hours long. I'm sorry I bought this and would like to return it. I will be more careful about purchasing only unabridged versions of audio books in the future."
4,Good read which gets better as you progress.,This story just got better as it progressed. I was surprised and entertained and hope to read many more of his novels.
5,Outstanding suspence!!!,This is the first but surely not the last book of Mr. Connelly's I've read. I couldn't put it down....... Mr. Connelly has a spider's talent. He weaves his beautifully constructed web....draws you closer and closer and then traps you in and you can't but at the same time you don't want to get out until it's over. I highly recommend this book....it doesn't have too many turns you can't keep track of them like some mysteries. Hope you enjoy!
4,"Had me to the end, but let me down a little!","I've read all of Connelly's work. I always enjoy the plots that he spins, but find he traps himself in the end. This one was no exception, the twist of the killer wanting to knock off people for their organs was original -- having it all hark back to another case, wasn't. I would rather have seen him finish off in the direction that he started instead of the villain being someone our hero never caught. Oh well, still worth the read!"
3,Previous books are better,"I became a Connelly fan when looking for a summer vacation read and picked up BLACK ICE, and became engrossed immediately. While I am waiting for him to pick up the Bosch character again, this book will suffice as a good read. But for the person who is just getting into his books I rate them this way. The Black Echo and The Last Coyote are THE BEST. So many plot twists and turns and it all fits together, a page turner to the very end. Which is what I don't like about Blood Work is that it laid out for you to much unlike the two above mentioned titles. I guess I just perfer Bosch's kick-ass style verses the lead characters in Blood Work and The Poet."
4,Layers Within Layers,"This one finally reaches the level of ""The Poet."" Serial killer police procedurals are a dime a dozen these days, but in ""Blood Work"" Michael Connelly has produced a truly impressive contribution to the genre. The reader is led through an increasingly confusing maze of mystery and misdirection that is a triumph of intricate plotting. For me, this book stands with Ruth Rendell's ""A Judgement in Stone"" in featuring one of the most unusual motives for murder that I have ever come across. Bravo, and keep them coming."
4,Good...but better performances exist...,"As a side note to the previous reviewer...the performances of the Six Chansons on this recording are indeed good...but even better performances (IMHO) of these exist on the recordings by Uwe Gronostay conducting the Netherlands Chamber Choir (Globe - #5125), and simply titled ""Hindemith: Choral Works"" here on Amazon. Of course, real Hindemith choral fans will want both."
4,My son's dream book,"Combining an alphabet book with realistic illustrations of cars, this book has everything my three-year old son could want. Each letter of the alphabet gets one principal automobile, and two or three profile drawings of additional cars whose names begin with the letter. The principal car gets a full-page illustration and a paragraph or two of information. Some of the choices are a little obscure for American readers (""H"", for example, is represented by Holden, an Australian car, rather than Honda), and the ""modern"" cars are now a bit dated, given its 1991 copyright. This book would appeal to a preschooler with an interest in cars, a young car fan wanting to broaden his or her horizons, and a father like me, looking for a book that I can happily reread when my son says, ""Again?"" If you're the kind of parent whose heart swells with pride when your toddler says, ""Ferrari Testarossa,"" you've found the right book."
5,"Exquisite - living, breathing tone","I prefer not to resort to 'overwrought' turns of phrase, but Mr Baumgartner's digital efforts here (live recording of a recital in Lugano I believe in 1962) are transcendental, as I sense them. The range of color, the transparency and warmth of the 'silentest' tones are, I would maintain, proof of other worlds, dimensions. He's a medium, his hands guided by ethereal Watchers, producing the 'Truth' according to M. Chopin (the 4th Ballade is divinatory).Like a fine cognac one returns to again and again... it does not get old.Unfortunately, Mr Baumgartner is little known these days it would seem. He was one of Mr Alf(red) Brendel's teachers (as was Mr Edwin Fischer, whose revelatory, intuitively insightful approach they have in common). This is not pedantic German 'scholastic' pianism - this is from the 'Pferd's mouth - soulful yearning cast in tone (bit purplish I realize - my apologies) - let him that can hear, hear..."
3,Poor organization,Everything Campbell ever said is no less from fascinating but the organization of this book by the editor is rather poor.I have an unusual kind of comment. The book is not comfortable for holding for long time. The paperback version could have been more fun.
4,The Heroes Journey; Joseph Campbell his life and work.,I have read parts of this book in a class situation. I am looking forward to rereading and finishing it soon.
3,Don't give up on New Orleans,"Too much press has been given to New Orleans' problems recovering from Hurricane Katrina: lack of civic leadership, accusations of racism, still-devasted neighborhoods. Tom Piazza makes the case for why we shouldn't simply write off this wonderful city. This brief book reminds us of the cultural contributions New Orleans gives us: music, food, literature; but the author doesn't endorse the rebuilding of this city as a museum of the past, but rather as a source of future cultural riches.The book does acknowledge the city's faults, but also reminds us of the importance of New Orleans' role in the economy, especially in its role as a transportation center and port.If you find yourself writing off this great city, give this book a read-it may give you a new perspective. If you're looking for a reason to visit New Orleans again, this may be it."
3,Good but not great,"It is clear the author is excited about New Orleans: anyone that lives here or has spent any time here is excited about this city. But the author's writing is a little too glossy, a little too travel-brochure-ish, and although he comes close to what he intends to say, he ends up missing the 'grit' of the city, the actual flavor, and in the end, to me, sounds somewhat superficial and naive."
4,good if you like drugs....,"i think it takes a certain type of person to like this book. i have never done drugs, but i loved it because it was funny and made no sense and reminded me of a day in my own life. i let my friend borrow it and she never finished, because it wasn't really about anything or so she told me. but somebody borrowed it from her and read it in a day or two and then we had conversations about how we wanted to do acid so we could do the stupid things the characters did. needless to say, i bought no acid, but i did enjoy the book and will probably have to buy it again since i never got it back......"
5,awesome read,"i read this book two years ago, more than once, and i have never forgotten it. it's written beautifully in first-person through the eyes of a seventeen year old dreamer. he and his three friends take acid, as they have many times before, but these 48 hours are different, and he starts to see the world and his friends differently. I absolutely loved this book, and i couldnt stop reading it. it's a nice departure form the usual anti-drug books for teens, it lets you make your own inferences for once. i recommend this book for anyone looking for a short, page-turner. it's extremely well written and keeps your attention until the end."
1,Boring,"Brendan and his friends are so shallow I was bored reading it. Is that all he's about,tripping? I guess so."
5,Just a bit a Pure Sunshine...,"Loved it! Simply great...lots of nice details. The style Brian James used in his book was very good. When I was reading this book I had felt like I was standint next to Brandon watching everything happen. Great adventure that deals with 3 boys that do acid. If you love reading Realistic Fiction than you should love this one. Go out and read it, get a bit of Pure Sunshine."
4,This changed my life,"Thomas Edison is one of my heros, and this story made it so.I was given this book when I was in the fifth grade, after reading it I set my life goal on being a Specialty Electrician. Now, fifty some years later, I have retired after many years fulfilling my dream.I purchased this book for my son because he remembers reading it as a youngster. Although he didn't persue the same trade I did, he enjoys the story of this famous inventer.Where would we be without his inventions?"
2,Better than nothing,"A lot of intellectuallized verbiage, but no real substance on how to train for internal strength, or how to use it for effective martial applications.On the other hand, it introduces some of the personalities of the Yi Quan world, and gives some relevant historical background on Wang XiangZhai."
4,Useful and cute,"We ordered this child-size wooden coat rack stand so our young children (5 and 7) could hang up their coats after school instead of piling them on the floor for us to pick up later. It works wonderful -- now they can reach it! The item itself screws together and can get flimsy if you let your kids play and/or hang on it, but overall, it works very well, my kids can reach it for their coats and backpacks, and it is designed with cute colors."
4,children's hall tree,The tree is a good size and the colors are exciting. It would be better if some of the pieces that are for coats to hang on were a little longer. A variety of sizes would be a help when hanging many coats.
1,"stupid interface, won't work on os x","On OS X 10.3, it worked when we installed it and has refused to run since then. No customer support we can find. I don't feel bad criticizing them because encoresoftware.com, listed in their troubleshooting guide, isn't even on the web any more. Why are they selling this crap in the Apple Store?And the interface design is laughably bad. It took us quite a while to find the lessons--they're under ""Typing Tournament"""
3,Good to fair,"My son used this for a while, but we still ended up with a professional typing CD to get the ""education"" piece of typing to occur."
1,sponge bob typing software,It's not getting very good reviews from me. The thing does not work--won't load on my computer==and I'm trying to return it. Not getting very good response from amazon about return procedures either.
1,Save your money,"This is a horrible typing program. A child could never use it alone, largely because there is endless ""lead-in"" to every game that is not obviously avoided. When one finally gets to the lesson, there is nothing exciting or motivating. It's not really a game to teach typing, it's really just a set of typing activities that just happen to have a cartoon character in the background. A real bore."
5,Good tutorial. Funny scripts,"My 8-year-old niece enjoys using this program. Already in the first hour, she's gone from a 2wpm hunt & peck to a consistent 5wpm with her hands in the correct position. I don't know what the previous reviewer was talking about in regards to just throwing the kid into the progam. There are easy lessons that slowly build up the child up. For instance, lesson 1 is right-hand only: asdf. Lesson 2 is left-hand only: ;lkj. You'll still have to help your kid find where the lessons are and coach them to not look at their hands. You can't just throw them in and expect them to start typing. The previous user's confusion probably stemmed from the fact that the ""Tournament"" section is where the lessons are. Jumping into the ""Practice"" section is typing text from a script. In that respect, the game could have been better labeled. But my niece is having fun and laughing while learning to type and that is what makes this program great."
4,Mesmerized,"My son is 8. Once he got going on it, he was hooked doing it all afternoon. He liked the %grade he received while learning. Of course, Sponge Bob and team make it goofy enough to be really fun. The only hassle we had was getting the CD to run. I had to uninstall, then re-install...but then it worked great on XP. His teachers in school wanted him to work on keyboarding skills over the summer. This one does it! AND it works on XP, where Mavis Beacon did not, at least up until recently."
2,NOT AQUALUNG - IT'S A GERMAN TECHNO BAND CALLED AQUALUNA!,"This has been mislabeled it's not british artist, Aqualung. It's a german techno band called Aqualuna doing 3 mixes of A-Ha's international hit ""Take on me"" - I like techno but don't think this 3 mixes are good at all. They used the chipmunks voice effect - oh no!"
3,Duena,"Could have used about another 2-3 hours to fill in some of the gaps, but I really like the rancho type telenovelas with men on horses:o) Plus I've watched just about everything that angelica rivera has made."
3,Pretty good telenovela,"First thing, this edition is way too short to actually be able to tell the story. It is way too edited and you should try to watch the entire thing (if possible an available). Regina was left at the altar by her fiancee. She goes to a ranch she owns and vows never to fall for a man again. In the process she becomes hardened and bitter. But, enter José María, the owner(?) of the ranch next door. He breaks down her defenses and they fall in love. Of course, a bunch of people try to break them up, especially her cousin (Cynthia Klithbo) who is also in love with Jose Maria. The telenovela is pretty good. It had ok acting, beautiful scenery and the usual plotline: Man and woman fall in love and people try to break them apart."
1,"Seller decides to cancel my order a week after it was suppose to arrive, and I heard it from Amazon, not the Seller","Wow is all I can say. After waiting for the product to arrive by the due date. I got nothing. I emailed the Seller through Amazon, got no reply from the seller. So I waited 5 days, still nothing. I emailed the Seller again, and this time Amazon replied back saying they were going to give me a refund because the Seller cancelled my order.I totally ran out of pads and had to go to the local pet store to purchase more. This in the internet age. When you purchase something online, you should get your order or a response as to why you haven't. What poor and total lack of customer service. Don't purchase anything from them."
3,Great for my Ferret Nation Cage.,"Not the best pads in the world (yes, they're thin and the inner lining isn't very well distributed), but perfect for what I needed them for and a great deal in regards to quantity - pet stores charge you an arm and a leg for pads!I use these for the platforms in my rat's Ferret Nation cage so the floors don't get sticky and gross. They're the perfect size, fit perfectly, and get the job done."
3,"Not bad for a purse, but would prefer a little padding","I received this for free with my Canon HV10 camcorder. It fits just fine, no room for anything else, but it is more like a purse than anything else. I would prefer even a thin lining of padding to protect the camera, this is just a leather purse that the camera happens to fit in"
3,Too small. Just enough to fit the camcoder,The bag is sturdy and well built. It is tailor made camcoder enclosure. My main complaint is it is too small. You need a seperate bag for tape and powersupply.
5,Canon Coach Case,"Its a great little bag for the HV10. A strange for me plus is that you can only carry the camera and either the remote or an extra battery, that's it! It won't allow you to carry around the kitchen sink. It has a good thickness leather that provides good shock and scratch protection. All the seams are well done. It is really the kind of quality bag that you would expect from Coach."
5,Superb Coach quality!,"I bought this for my digital camera - a Sony Cybershot DSC-T200 - so there is plenty of room for my camera as well as media cards, extra battery and a small map when traveling. The case is extremely well-made - supple, soft leather and quality stitching throughout. The lining has the signature Coach logo in a tone-on-tone black and the magnetic clasp and hardware on the strap loops has the Coach name as well. There is a small pocket in the front and a 3 x l 1/2"" wide leather loop in the back if you want to attach this to your belt. This case can actually function as a small purse as well since it can easily hold my digital camera, Blackberry and credit card case. This has been available in a huge range of prices. I am thrilled with this for the price I paid and it is indeed a great Coach product. But to each his own if the Coach name itself is worth the premium over other cases when it is not on sale."
1,great concept...,"I bought this thing because I needed a set of battery-powered speakers for my mp3 player, and I thought it'd be awesome to have it hold my Mountain Dew too. However, the cooler is not very good, in that it's not solid and if it's not full, it topples over or folds in on itself. And the speakers only worked for about 2 hours before dying, and the antenna broke off when someone touched it lightly. Not recommended."
1,Now I know why No Doubt started going down the flusher...,"The most recent No Doubt CD's were tolerable at best. The 80s influence on Rock Steady was starting to peak in...Gwen Stefani needs to stay with ska...or rock. Instead, she decided to make this poppy, crappy album. It's painful to listen to. Some of the songs are catchy, but not in a good way. They're catchy like Britney Spears...you want to stab yourself in the head with a spoon for humming them. I'm so disappointed."
2,Not Bad...But Not Good,"This CD was not as bad or as good as most of the reviewers thought. It is just plain mediocre! OK Gwen, you've proved that you are the media darling in No Doubt - but you need the guys. Gwen Stefani is not a terrific singer, but she kicks ass with No Doubt. Her personal style is cool, and she out rocks all of the Britneys and Christinas, but this CD makes me miss the ""old band"". When I listen to LAMB's songs, I long for the mid nineties, when Tragic Kingdom was on top of the world. ""Whatcha Waitin For""? The next No Doubt album."
1,"Gwens solo album, not so good","As a big fan of No Doubt and Gwen Stefani, I was excited to hear about the relase of Gwens solo album. Not a big fan of pop music, I really thought the single ""what you waiting for"", was the catchy up beat funky sound that would follow through out this album. I was wrong. This album is a mish mash of music styles that dont really compliment Gwens talent. This album is a really bad attemp in recapturing 80's pop. Although, I was blown away by the song ""rich girl"" ,A very awesome collaboration with Eve, this rest of this album falls short of anything worth listening to."
3,well...,"I like this album, but after a while, listening to it bores me out. Individually, the songs are great, they're the kind of songs that, after listening to them, get stuck into your head for the next week, but in a good way. I would recommend buying the singles instead of the complete album."
5,hot debut,"Gwen Stefani has taken the reigns and came out with a hot debut of her own. I love most of these songs and her unique sense of style and music. My favorites are cool, what you waiting for, and hollaback girl. Check out this hot and sexy album."
4,A Guilty Pleasure!,"First of all, I'm nearly 46 years old and on first listen, thought I may be too old to enjoy this.However...I am so wrong! This cd is hilarious, musically intriguing and chock full of interesting references. Ms. Stefani has always been a favorite of mine and as a solo CD I think she really did well with this effort.Even my husband, who was determined at first not to enjoy this has come around.All I can say is this CD makes me feel like I'm in my 20's again! If I'd heard this back then, I would have worn out the grooves on the record!A guilty pleasure for sure and gets better with each listen. The only problem with being this age and listening to this music is I can't read the liner notes at all - the print is way too small!"
3,A Good album that almost delivers,"This album contains a few gems: What You Waiting For,Hollaback Girl,Danger Zone. If the rest of the songs were as good this album would have been a bubble-gum pop music classic, but unfortunatley the album is a complete mess & some songs just have no business being included like the preachy joykill: Long Way to Go(b-side material). This album is a fun ride but 5 stars, No way!"
2,Two Stars Might Be Generous,"I really wanted to like this. I love Gwen Stefani's voice. She's hip, fresh & talented. So I thought until I listened to this.There are only a few salvagable songs. These include: What You Waiting For?, Rich Girl (includes samples), Luxurious( sample included) & Harajuku Girls. The latter is silly wierd & fun.The rest of the songs are terrible. The retro 80's songs are bland rejects form probably one hit wonders of the that time.The album, as a whole, is unoriginal as noted above with the sampling that occurs on the record. Gwen at times mumbles so much you think you're listening to Britney Spears or Janet Jackson. I expected much better from her.She should stick to NO DOUBT."

1,I don't care for it.,I don't let my child hear gwen stefani.and I don't like her songs.like....''what you waiting for?''.the words are bad.
2,"Aw, Gwen... (Shakes head in disappointment and disbelief)","Well, one star is for the two catchy songs that aren't too bad- ""Rich Girl"" and ""What are you waiting for"". The other star is to applaud her for trying to pull this album off. ""Hollaback girl"" makes me nauseous, and is reminiscent of that song from the 90's Gillete's ""short d*ck Man""- just an anoyying, whiny, ho-anthem from highschool. I know, as the rest of america does, that Gwen has talent. She missed the boat here, though-- Gavin should have spoken up on this one."
4,A pretty great CD (even with a few missteps),"Ready to assume Madonna's throne for the 21st century, Gwen Stefani released the most fun CD of 2004. Funky, spunky and admittedly a little clunky, ""Love, Angel, Music, Baby"" is a delightful mishmash of dance, soul, and 80's pop. The disc's pièce de résistance, ""Cool,"" is a perfect execution of great lyrics and vocal styling. Unapologetic dance tracks like ""Serious,"" ""Rich Girl,"" and ""The Real Thing"" make the CD groove, while ""Luxurious"" takes a too-oft-sampled Isley Brothers slow jam and makes it sound fresh. Gwen truly shines on this CD whose radiance almost lets us forgive her for that infuriating ""Bubble Pop Electric"" track. Almost."
2,"From a fan of Music,","From a musical standpoint, and a honest one, this album has two good tracks. The simply amazing ""What You Waiting For?"" and one hook wonder ""Bubble Pop Electric"". The rest is pure, how do I say, boring? Unlistenable? Annoying? The record is rushed and unfortunate. I respect Gwen, but c'mon, dont lie to yourselves, this is purely a bad record, save two tracks."
2,trying (too) hard to be ???,"Hey we all know Gwen Stefani cool. But to the point: What U waiting for is cool,with some crunchy guitar samples treatment like Eno might do. A couple of tracks that sound just like 80's MAdonna or PRince are enoyable. But the slut disco rap songs about limos (or whatever) are dumb, and ""Bubble Pop electric"" is the most annoying thing ever. If you want snotty smart J-pop influenced punky pop tunes checkout Le Tigre instead.Gwen already has enough sycophants, Im sure ...."
2,Oh dear,"Ok so I did expect this to be a partial remnant of No Doubt, and I love Gwen, she is amazing in all possible ways. I heard the fist single off the album (what you waiting for) and I thought yea this album will be awesome. NO. I did not like it, not my taste at all; still love Gwen, but a disappointment indeed. The album title is a bit unfitting of her too, I think that if you are looking for bad R&B meets the 80's, then this will be a great record for you, other wise if you are looking for some good Gwen vibe, don't look there."
4,Very Groovy!,"The first three songs on this disc rock! The song produced by New Order is outstanding. In fact, I would give a thumbs up to the entire CD. It will keep you bouncing in your car. :)"
5,Gwen is #1,"Gwen is the BEST!This album has been in the billboard top 40 for like a whole year now!!!It has sold so many millions of copies and for a good reason!IT got 4 out of 5 stars on Rollingstones and ""Hollaback girl"" is the first song on Itunes that has sold over 1 MILLION!!!!!2005 is the year of Gwen Stefani!!!Buy this album it soooo rocks!"
1,should give it 0 stars...,"i hate gwen steffani...i never liked her either. her songd (to me) stink! hollaback girl, and all the other crappady pooh she writes stinks...i do not recommend this poop."
1,30 days no CD !,"ITS been about a month and no delivery,when i contacted the seller he told me a couple more days are you kidding me,he didnt give me no info to track the item nor a date of arrival,something fishy going on here!"
3,"Shit, - Too many swears","What is the point of the swears. The music has a good beat, so I bought the cd to bring to the dance studio, but can't use it with the swears.So now it is just trash."
2,No Doubt It Falls Short,"The first 2 songs are this CD are great. The rest are terrible. I think if you're a No Doubt fan who loved nearly every song on their last CD, you will be even further disappointed in this one.It starts out creative and interesting, and then it's like she ran out of things to say / tried to hard / or something.My advise, don't bother with this one."
1,Not even worth a star,"""Hollaback Girl"" is seriously one of the worst songs I have ever heard. Gwen Stefani is just another pop artist who sings stuff other people give to her, and she is not even that talented! Who does that sound like ...cough...britney...cough...spare yourself from this horrible piece of crap! Switch the station when one of her songs come on the radio! that is how awfully horrible this is! Now if your looking at this item right now, you probably like her music. Go ahead and give me unhelpful votes. I don't care. Considering you like the pop genre, I would sooner buy the backstreet boys new cd than this. If you really want something good buy some hard rock like guns n roses greatest hits or a stone temple pilots cd."
2,Oh dear God,"Gwen, I like you. I really do. and I love no doubt, but why why why did you do this to yourself?! I even love the 80s... what with VH1 and all, how can you not? But this CD is a mess. There are a few songs that I have found I can listen to, but most of them are just... I dunno. Everyone has their own opinion, but in my opinion this was a selfless plug for your clothing line (as it is mentioned in many songs). It could have been better Gwen!Gwen + No Doubt = good80s music = goodGwen + 80s music = train wreck squared."
1,Sounds like.....,"I honestly really miss No Doubt. I think the new solo stuff is aimed for the younger crowd. I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this but the song ""Harajuku Girls"" sort of has a Lords of Acid sound to it, no?"
1,SO BAD!!,"What the hell are those Japanese girls???The lyrics are shallow, Gwen looks dumb and music are annoying.I'm really embarrassed to say I used to like No Doubt."
1,So bad it's not even funny,"If I hear that stupid Holla back girl on the radio one more time I think I'm going to chop my ears off, this has to be one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life, It has to be a joke , because if it's not Gwen is retarded. It says the same thing over a nd over and over again. This is the worst no talent piece of garbage album ever made."
1,disapointing :(,Just not the Gwen I have always known and loved....a real turn off.I ran out and bought this the minute it was released just knowing that I would love anything from Gwen. Boy was I wrong...I won't try to convince you one way or the other...I see some good reviews here so apparently some must like it. Just check this album out before you spend your money. Not the same girl who used to rock out with Bradley back in OC.
3,"Hmmmmm... I need more money so I can have ""wicked style""","Although I must say I am am a huge No Doubt and Gwen Stephani fan, I have to admit I was a little confused with Gwen's solo album. It seems totally off kilter with the Gwen I'm used to. The whole album is pretty much a big promotion for her new clothing line L.A.M.B. Some of the songs are pretty cool, even though just about all of them mention something about harajuku girls or L.A.M.B. I suppose a change of style is ok, so I'm still a fan of Gwen. I just wish that it didn't seem as though this album was telling everyone how cool it is to be wealthy and be able to afford all of these fancy schmancy things. What ever happened to the Gwen who made her own tank tops and used a bedazzler to stud her bra straps with rhinestones? That was a bigger pick me up for all the fans who are in there teens and/or twenties on a limited budget! L.A.M.B is as expensive as Juicy Couture! Grrrr wicked style!"
1,total disappointment!,"who is this girl? this is not the same tomboy/dorky Gwen i know in a band called No Doubt. her image has totally changed and i dont like it. she cares too much of what people think of her now. with no doubt all their songs were deep in meaning and actually meant something! this **** is bananas. i could have wrote that!! no offense to gwen or anything, i luv her 2 death and im the hugest fan of no doubt but i cant accept her new pop sound. it just blends in with all the other artists!"
3,Better off without it,"Child-like songs with too much going on (sounds like the song is made for video). If you are over 13, don't buy it. Only decent songs are:The Real Thing - because it sounds NewOrder-esque.Long Way To Go - because Gwen barely singsMy suggestion: Listen to the clip of The Real Thing and if you like it, use your $12 dollars and buy a New Order CD."
5,The best CD of 2004!!!!!,"This CD is awesome. It really hsows what Gwen Stefani wanted to show. This style it totally new, and even thought people that liked NO DOUBT dont like her no more, i think that she still has a good voice and good songs in this album. i know is going to take long for her to come out with a new album, but when she does i hope that she is going to use her amazing voice in even somehting bigger.The desing of the deluxe edition is awesome, and i love that it can come either in blue or red. i got the blue one cuz i thought is was a better color, and the bag for the CD had a unique desing. Love it to death!!!Love you Gwen!!! - Andres"
2,What the *&^$ is this?,"I absolutely adore Gwen Stefani. She is an icon in many ways, but this is possibly one of the worst albums I have ever heard. It is not even worth giving to charity. Definitely a waste of money. All of these songs are terrible! It is going in the trash."
1,You know.....she's really changed,"And it ain't for the better!!! She used to be a sweet, shy, quiet normal girl-and maybe thats still da case, but that aint how she's coming off in her music, which portrays her as a stupid, juvenile, egotistical, Japan-obsessed little girl-who can't make halfway decent music to save her life. God,[...]!!!!! Every song is so annoying (cept of course the smash debut single), you will just want to rip your ears off. It's noise. Not music. And yes, even metalhead teens would agree to this. And don't even get me started on ""Long Way To Go"" UUUGGGH, yes, Gwen, you proved that you do indeed have a long way to go before you can do jack s*** solo. As Timothy Brough masterfully stated, a true statement that could be made about this album would be if Gwen were to just come out, hold up the CD and admit, [...] Because that's all this is. Her worthless, nasty, [...]"
2,soooo much ego!!,"As usual with Gwen's writing, most of the tracks on this album are very autobiographical. But on this album, she seems to be pushing the point that she's wealthy and has everything. That's fabulous for her! She's a great talent and deserves what she's got. But please, does she really have to tell us all about her blingbling in 2/3rds of the tracks?Beyond the display of ego, I was able to tune out the tracks in the last half of the album. Meaning, that they weren't as annoying and grating as ""Hollaback Girl"" and ""Rich Girl."" ""Hollaback Girl"" is definately hip hop, but not in a good way. The song doesn't make much sense, and just seems a carrier to be able to say ""this my sh*t"" over and over again in an urban-like accent. She sounds ridiculous."
2,sadly disappointed,"I am a HUGE fan of Gwen Stefani, but I was sadly disappointed with her new album. She has such a great voice and a lot of talent, and I don't feel she fully utilized her capacities. Another problem I have as a No Doubt fan is that at least half the album is R&B/Hip Hop influenced. I hate that genre of music. I absolutely love ""What You Waiting For?"" and cannot listen to it enough. I bought the album, expecting at least most of the other songs would be along the same lines as her first single--upbeat, dance-type music. I guess it might be a good album for those who like R&B/Hip Hop type stuff. I hope Gwen decides to lean more towards her old style and/or more dance music in her next album. She has a GREAT singing voice...not so much a good rap voice. I want the old Gwen back!"
2,Where's Gwen?!?!,"Man, I am so disappointed in this first solo project by Gwen. I love this girl...well, the girl from No Doubt anyways. This must be one artist that is greatly influenced by her producers since it certainly doesn't sound like the kind of things Gwen sings about in No Doubt. She writes a lot of the material in No Doubt so I just wonder about this new cd. Also, it is explicit in a lot areas...I think a warning label would be most appropriate so that people can be aware of what they are buying. Overall, I can see why there are so many used copies being sold here on Amazon. I hope Gwen does another solo project that reflects more of the artist I have known in the past..."
4,Pretty good solo record,"Gwen stefani is an amazing artist! This album is full of catchy, fun to listen to songs. I love the song ""Hariguko girls"" its very creative! Rich girl and Holla Back girl are such big hits and they are such good songs!! the song ""Cool"" is 1 of my favorite songs ever!! Its so sweet!! this album is a very creative album that gwen rocks aT!"
2,WRONG directi0n....completely,"The problem with this cd is not the lack of skill but the lack of direction. The best song on here is not 1, 2, or 3. altough saying that the sh*t is bananas is genius (*rolls eyes sarcasticly) The best song on the album is the urban sounding track 7!! this is a great sound for the music and her voice styles. She should definitely learn from that track and go from there in her future!!! Se would without a doubt begin to earn recognition for a fresh new sound in a world of overdone stlyes of music."
2,Bring back No Doubt,"After the release of this cd, my respect for Gwen has gone down. This is the first ((and hopefully the last)) solo cd from Gwen Stefani. I wonder why she gave up No Doubt. Was it to look like an idiot, making horrible pop? I really think that only the tweens who still listen to Radio Disney like this trash. The only three songs that are somewhat good are ""Cool"", ""Rich Girl"", and ""Long Way to Go"". ((Those songs are really what saved this cd from a one star rating.)) The cd isn't worth it. Buy those mp3's if you must but DON'T buy this cd."
4,Four Stars,"Ms. Gwen has a fun new album on her hands. It took some time for a couple of songs to get onto my ""I like this song"" list, but all of them made it except for her song ""Luxurious"". Ms. Gwen, what were you thinking when you decided to do that song! Keep the R&B; to the experts. That song flops and I always skip it. Please no more of that in future albums.As for the rest of her songs... Love them! They get stuck in my head and reminds me of Madonna in the 80's and even some of Pink's tunes. Great album, but ""Luxurious"" cost her a star. Four stars Ms. Gwen."
1,wack!!,This cd is not worth buying.It has wack beats she talks about stupid stuf and does not make sense at all!So dont buy it becouse it is defenetly worth $14.00.
1,"Learn, About, Music, Biatch is what it should be called...","This CD is as pretentious as it is HORRIBLE, I'm embarrased for her. How is it that a decent vocalist like Britney Soears is badgered for her voice when Gwen manages to sound like Britney on helium with a more annoying whine? As a huge fan of No Doubt I was anticipatign this CD. Apparently the boys behind the girl are where the talent lies in that band. I wonder if Gavin Rossdale can even stomach this crap. It sounds liek a horrible 80's cd? What is with trying to bring that ""sound"" back. WASTE OF MONEY and not even worth downlaoding illegally."
2,I'm A Fool to buy this one!!,"This Cd is a disappointment to me,as it sounds too commerical to my ears.I think the song Rich Girl is a rip off of Fiddler on The Roof Rich Man. The CD is also too much rap and bad use of electroic Sound mixes. I thought it better because of her ties to No Doubt. The only count on this CD I like is COOL because of it up tempo no Doubt beat."
1,"Awful, awful, awful!","Gwen Stefani's fist solo album is so hideous and tripe. Her voice is flat and lifeless, her songwriting is getting worse with every song, she has no talent so why the hell is she is so freakin' popular. Love, Angel, Music, Baby has to be one of the worst records I have ever listened to. The only track that is halfway decent is Cool. Terrible, terrible record, I heard she is gonna make a second solo album, well good luck Stefani. Her No Doubt bandmates had all the talent, so go flying back to them. Her lyrics are silly, shallow, and pretentious. Who does she think she is? This is the worst album of all-time, stay clear from this disaster."
1,What was she thinking!,"I can't believe this album is rated so high. I think in general people like to overrate in order not to dissapoint people. Well this was certainly a big dissapointment, especially after the single, which i did like. No doubt is one of the bands in the pop-genre i still like, which is rare (Although it's not 100% pop). Therefore the dissapointment might even be greater after hearing this load of crap. I didn't like one song, maybe with the exception of ""The Real Thing"", but then there are still the lyrics which are written by some 12-yo. After hearing it once, which was a nightmare for my ears, i gave it a few more chances because it was Gwen. I just couldn't believe that it was so bad, but after hearing it 5 times i couldn't torture my ears anymore. I hope she comes up with something more intelligent the next time or at least something not this bad, which is almost impossible."
5,pure fun,Dont listen to the morons who give this album one star. They are the ones who dont own this album. Love.Angel.Music.Baby (LAMB) is addictive to listen to and is pure fun. Each time you listen to this album you will not help but dance to the beat of this album. This album is a must have for 2005!
1,Original???,"The only thing Gwen ever did that I liked was ""Don't speak"" with No Doubt. I'm still waiting for anything even near that good.When one of the other reviewers said this crap was original, I had to laugh.Do any of these idiots realize that ""Rich Girl"" is a rip-offfrom, ""If I were a Rich Man"" from the Broadway show ""Fiddler on the Roof""?? Yea, real original"
1,"Crap, plain and simple","The reviewer John made a review saying this album was cool and whacky. Well John, you dont know music."
1,Trash,"Gwen must of thought she could make some big bucks by going on the current ""Ghetto Bandwagon"". Seems as if she got the idea that she'd be come ""bigger"" if she turned into a ""thug"".The tracks and lyrics make no sense what so ever. Do like I did with this review, put no effort into it and don't grab your credit card."
2,gwen or no doubt,"i think she is better in a group, her fist song was a remix of an old song, her second song was a copy of a movie and her third song was about cheer leaders???. i don't get it. this was her first cd as a solo artist. sorry but she copies everything and i already forgot what her songs sound like , no fan here."
3,gwen gives me wood....,"and hollaback girl is catchy in my skull, foul temptress, as for the rest of the album, its terribly gay (as in happy and homosexual), but i guess that was the intention."
2,Been There Done That,This is the album Madonna never released (when she was 18).It lacks maturity and talent and is disappointing from a usually good artist. If u love bands like Aqua (Barbie Girl) you'll love this album.
4,"A departure from No Doubt, but it's good","I like No Doubt, they are a strong band that consistantly puts out good albums - so, of course, I was going to buy this CD. It's layed out like any CD that has been made in the past few years. The strongest group of tracks are the first on the CD. They are great! A great mix of good vocals and innovative sounds. She even throws a little ""Fiddler on the Roof"" in. The later part of the album is a little weaker but does have a couple strong tracks, like the social conscience collaboration with Andre 3000 and the song ""Cool""-which actually sounds a lot like a No Doubt song. She also explores some sounds reminicent of 80's techno- which I love. There are a few tracks on this album that left something to be desired but, as far as I am concerned, every album has at least a couple of those. All in all, I've had the album for a week and have enjoyed it a lot and listened and danced to it a ton! Great purchase for any one who likes Gwen's voice and likes to dance."
2,Big Disappointment,"I think Gwen is so cool and always loved her in No Doubt, so I was expecting something really great from her solo album. But I have to say, I could BARELY listen to it once...same old overproduced R&B/hip-hop/rap crap that it seems you can not escape from no matter where you turn these days. And I was disappointed in the lyrics as well. Gwen, stick to rock/pop and let everyone else do the cliches."
1,What is this?!,"I hear everybody talking about how much this album sucks compared to No Doubt. I hear everyone else saying that we should not compare it to ND, this is a fresh release not meant to be an extension of ND's music and style. I agree completely. With that said, this album SUCKS ANYWAY. I don't care if you compare it to Pavarotti or 50, this album suffers from a lack of originality and completely amateur songwriting."
1,This is so bad...,"...it makes 'Rocky Stedy' look like a masterpiece. For god's sake, like Eggplant said, how can you go from being in the same genre as Sublime (great ska/alt. rock abnd if you don't know them) to the same as Britney Spears?????????????????????????? This is the final nail is the GS coffin. Stick with old No Doubt. Listen to Eggplant, he knows his music."
2,Expected More,"When I heard quite a while ago that Gwen was coming out with a solo CD, I was SO excited! Then when I heard months ago all the heavy hitter Producers she was going to have I was even more ecstatic. The first single is (What You Waiting For) is awesome! Rich Girl with Eve is a great song too. They just have a neat chemistry together. Hollaback Girl was one of my favorite songs on here along with Danger Zone. The 2 songs with Andre 3000 are horrid. They just sound like a bunch of noises thrown together that sounds like a big train wreck! I guess I expected more. But, it is a pretty so-so CD. I like her unique voice and style. I am not disappointed that I bought it but I was hoping for so much more."
3,"Its ok, takes a little getting used to Were still cool!","At first I was expecting the usual no doubt ska-like sounds, but it's not at all. I hated it at first. I thought Gwen sounded like a big SELL OUT, but once you listen a few times, you start to pick up on what she was trying to accomplish. There are a few slutly sounding songs about sex and cursing and some of the song sound like rap or R&B, but once you get past those you start to feel the grove. Great colaborations with our musicians and a nice 80's vibe. All in all, its pretty good, you just have to put the usual no doubt sound out of your mind. Its Gwen Stefani, not No Doubt. The one about the Japenese Girls and the song with Andre 3000 kick major ass! Waiting for the tour to come.....Enjoy."
2,How very disappointing,"I looooooove No Doubt, but this cd really makes me want to punch someone. All the music on it's good, but Gwen's lyrics really suck. I recommend downloading the songs instead of buying the cd."
1,You should've waited.,"I really do NOT like this album. Having liked No Doubt for a few years, I'd expected a lot from Gwen, aand even though I became skeptical after What You Waiting For came out, I hung in, but this album is terrible. She needs to not conform, and stick to what she's good at."
2,"No blood, sugar, sex, magic!","As a fan of new wave faves like Duran Duran, Lena Lovich and Ultravox I was pleased to hear some of the nostalgia used on this cd, but I was left wanting more. This cd leaves me cold. It is an easily forgotten jumble of 80's stylings coupled with today's un-dynamic and monolithic urban stylings. This is a collection of songs that should have been produced on vinyl only. It is intended for those who have an ear for dj'ing the best parts for the dance floor only. A truely disappointing individual listen."
1,Lame,This album totally sucks. She had lost her writing skills which was obvious when listening to that crappy reggae-wannabe album rock steady. So to make up for it she enlists all these mainstream hit-makers on this one. The hilarious part is that the assitance had only backfired and this record sounds like every other disposable pop TRL trash that's already polluted our airwaves. HAHA her album has only been out for like a week and there's already a ton of used gwen albums up for sale. One final note: there's nothing lamer than a chick in her mid 30s trying to pretend like she's still 18. It's like your mom trying to hang out with yout high school friends after school cause she still thinks she's hip. lame
3,Gwen Stefani...,"When I heard Gwen's first single 'What you waiting for', I was really excited about her new album that was coming out. Thinking that all of the songs were going to be good (based on her past albums with No Doubt), I purchased the CD a couple days after it came out.The second I got into the car, I popped the CD into the player, and listened to the first few songs. After a while, i noticed that some of the songs were kind of weird and out there... they almost sounded exactly like Madonna.It would have been better if Gwen could have made an album that had more of her own sound, but personally, I think that Gwen is more of a performing artist than one in the studio. She is an amazing performer at concerts, so I respect that about her.Love, Angel, Music, Baby was a different CD that had some good songs, but it was a little too out there with some songs."
1,Stefani: From Fortune to Fluff,"There is only one reason that this album raised a single eyebrow in the pop world...because the act was once the lead singer of a unique, cutting-edge female band. In a world of many Pop clones, this album is simply one more soundalike. The lyrics are shallow and often redundant. The Hip-Hop artists are an old gimmick. You can dance to the beat, but the electronic instrumentation is typically boring. I have no idea what emotional mid-life crisis Gwen is going through, but she's a heck of a long way from No Doubt. Teens will probably eat this stuff up like gum, but as an adult, I take no pleasure in watching someone de-evolving."
3,No Doubt Fan...Gwen? Not so much.,"I am a very very huge No Doubt fan (mainly of their older music, though). I was kind of skeptical about Gwen going on her own and especially so when I heard it was a pop/dance album. I did like her first single release though (What Are You Waiting For?)!!!! That is a great track. When I first got the album I was really disappointed and nothing seemed that great. However, when I keep listening to it the weird but catchy beats and grooves really get to you such as Hollaback Girl and Rich Girl. This is an album that you can't really listen to normally and over and over again but it is awesome if you're dancing or at a party. The chorus' are just really easy to sing along to and remember, perfect for listening to with friends/in a group. It's one of those things were everybody will remember the lyrics and sing along to. Not the best album and certainly not related to No Doubt but it ain't bad."
5,Take a Chance,"This is my favorate album to date. The songs are hypnotic, infectious and clever. The best songs for myself are: What you waiting for, Holla Back Girl, Rich Girl, Cool, Harajuku Girls and Crash. If you don't buy it your making a mistake. Take this chance, what you waiting for?"
4,VeRy NiCe,"This CD is pretty good. The best fast song is Hollaback Girl (banana's) (lol) . The best slow-ish song is Luxurious. Is still Pretty good CD There R 7 good songs If you dont like this Cd I recommend Ashlee Simpsons ""Autobiography"" Peace.!!!!!!!!!!"
3,OK CD,"I'm 50/50 on this CD. I like almost half and disliked almost half. The majority of the songs I like are played on the radio and did get overplayed, so I had to stop listening to the CD for a while."
2,Stick with No Doubt Gwen...,"The first four songs are very good, extremely catchy. Unfortunately the last 8 aren't, in fact they are down right awful. I like Gwen, she's probably the most beautiful woman in the world but she should have stuck with No Doubt."
3,LAMB,C'mon people! She's way better than Fergie from the BEP! Fergie has such a fat ass anyways. Gwen Stefani's music videos are so cheesy these days. I wish she was still sippin' on chamolmil. I found some in the grocery store.
4,Wow..Great CD. A Lot Of Variety.,"I bought this CD cause my friend recommend it to me. It's really good. I heard most No Doubt fans don't like it. Well, I never listen to No Doubt, but I can say she's really talented. Looks like she moved to the Hip-hop side of music which is great. She really has a good voice. If you like Hip-Hop, Dance, Alternative, you would really like this CD. Only down side is it was short only 12 tracks."
2,grow up gwen!,"she needs to stop acting like a 15 year old cause she's close to 40 and experiencing mid life crisis which resulted in this horrible CD. ""hollaback"" to no doubt and fast and you can save your music career gwen"
1,Tell the stupid little kids to go listen to No Doubt; NOT THIS!,"I love No Doubt and this teeny-bopper pop CD is garbage. If you were disappointed by the direction No Doubt took with Rock Steady, you will absolutely hate this CD. Tell Gwen to get back together with No Doubt and let them do all the work, since they will hopefully want to do something to appeal to their real fans; NOT THE STUPID LITTLE KIDS THAT WATCH MTV!!!I recommend you go buy one of No Doubt's good CD's (self-titled or The Beacon Street Collection if you want their best work; Tragic Kingdom or Everything In Time if you are more into their poppier sound) and hope that Gwen realizes that the pop music genre sucks. Hopefully, we'll get another good No Doubt album within the next couple of years before Gwen's voice gets even worse."
1,uncanny. tender. moist.,"i recently purchased a japanese imported copy of this record (with 4 additional bonus tracks not available on the domestic release) for $39.99 at the local Tower Records. On the inset, there's a personalized note from Gwen to her Japanese fans that reads:To my fellow Jap friend:Thanks for your interest in my music. Listen to this record carefully as I will never tour your horrendous country, nor do I like your cuisine.Your friend,Gwen.I was intially appalled by the note, but as a Japanese American i realized, wait a minute, Japan is horrendous, and fact is, the cuisine does kinda stink.I am 10 years old."
1,Mistake,"I think Gwen made a huge mistake with her solo career. No Doubt was amazing, but her new lyrics ""You've got a million dollar contract, and they're all waiting for your next track"" are awful. She's singing about how she's ""hot"" and rich, how vain is that? I was a huge fan of hers until she went solo."
2,Immature and Disappointing,"I had hoped we would get a mature Gwen CD that reflects her experience and yet still fun. What we have is a CD with a couple of songs about gettin it on in the back seat of a car, an ode to how wonderful Gwen thinks she is and other fluffy, teen-topic songs.I had hoped Gwen would be more eager to show off her musical ability. Instead, its shallow and boring. If you're under 20 years of age, you may like it. If you're over Brittney, Christina and Jessica, don't bother."
2,"I'm a big No Doubt/Gwen fan, but...","...if this album isn't a dissapointment I don't know what is! I love her single, ""What are You Waiting For"" but the album as a whole stinks! It also gets aggrivating after the 14th mention of ""harajuku girls"" and how their style is sooo ""wicked""! I wish I would have known this before buying the album. It had potential... but I just don't know what happened!"
1,Wasn't she always a solo artist?,"When she was with No Doubt she was practically the star of the show anyway so her ""solo"" release is nothing special. I wasn't even overly impressed with her first single ""What You Waiting For."" Just stick to old school No Doubt...those were her best years."
1,"She sucks solo, and No Doubt sucks","the crap people listen to these days is just hysterical.All the way from the early 90s all i remember people talking about is bands that don't even exist anymore. Gwen stefanie is just trying to make more money since nobody likes her No Doubt Garbage.If you payed money for this, you are better off donating it to charity."
3,immature music,"Rich Girl. Hello? U R a rich girl dear. Even in your Orange County days u were still a middle class girl but never a ghetto or poor girl. So stop singing about how hard your life is or was. Rich Girl sounds so childish. This is a song a 10 year old would sing. Also, Hollarback Girl is also a very childish song. And why is she singing a cheerleader themed song and dressing like a cheerleader. U R in your mid 30's now. And what is up with your asian mafia dancers and your Japanese image. I guess by doing this Gwen can feel like shes the only pretty supreme white girl."
2,A big disappointment.,"Gwen is a living anachronism. Chronologically she is 36. She's got the body of a 24 year old. Unfortunately her debut album would suggest that emotionally, she's 12.This is one of the most over hyped and over produced albums to some down the pike in the last fer years. The lyrics are inane beyond belief. For someone old enough to be the mother of many of her fans you would expect something a little deeper then ""my ship is banana's"". Oh well, I guess that what gets you on TRL?"
1,"Love, Angel, Music, Baby, Disappointment","First off, I am big Gwen/No Doubt fan but the songs on this CD are pretty bad. I hope Gwen gets the ""white girl R&B"" phase out of her system soon."
5,almost perfect,"This CD is brave, blunt, and different. I love it. Gwen doesn't shy away from anything on this cd. Although many people claimed to not have liked, ""Hollerback Girl,"" it was the most downloaded song two years ago. I don't think everyone is being honest. This CD is fun all the way through, I play this CD from start to finish and it keeps me moving, and I have owned for a year and a half. I haven't tired of it yet."
2,she's got jungle fever,if you like pop with a little hip hop flavor this is just for you pharrell's production is okay and eve has a nice prescence but it looksd like gwen is trying too hard to be ghetto on certain songs anyway worth a listen but none of my money enjoy.
3,"Exciting, Interesting, But Not Great","This CD has some really good songs on like ""What You Waiting For"" but they get old soon. A couple songs on here like ""Cool"" and ""The Real Thing"" were the only songs that I could really enjoy over and over again. Songs like ""Bubble Pop Electric"" and ""Crash"" are fun but they aren't really songs I find myself humming or wanting to listen to. They're more of just the occasional listen when you're not in a serious mood. In conclusion, this CD has some memorable songs, some fun and crazy ones, and some songs that will be stuck in your head, unfortunately. This CD is energetic but not for the more serious listener and you won't be interested in it for very long."
4,Gwen Scores,"For those who say that this album is a bunch of electronic fluff, you need to condsider the artist. What do you expect out of Gwen Stefani? Do you expect ""Whitney Houston-like"" ballads? The fact of the matter is that Gwen's voice simply isn't strong enough for that genre. Love.Angel.Music.Baby is a fun album that shouldn't be taken too seriously, although the final track ""Long Way To Go"", featuring Andre 3000, concerns the very serious issue of racism. Gwen made the album for herself, drawing on the music she grew up with in the 80's. She has her own fashion sense and musical style, and she makes no apologies for it. The album is fun and funky, although her obsession with these Harajuku girls is a bit odd. But this is just another example of her personality which she makes no apologies for. Go by the album...its great to party with your friends to. Key tracks: ""Hollaback Girl"", ""Luxurious"", ""Serious"", ""Long Way To Go""."
2,"Meh, she's certainly not Madonna","I can't believe the insane people here comparing Gwen to Madonna. Maybe when Gwen can actually perform onstage like Madonna and sell over 200 million albums like Madonna, and have a voice like Madonna, then I'd compare her to Madonna.Gwen is alright when she's with No Doubt, but as a solo ""artist"" this broad don't cut it.Thanks to Linda Perry's genius, What You Waiting For was a great song.Fiddler on the roof deserves the credit for Rich Girl. And Eve bites....Cool is a nice songHollaback Girl was written when gwen was smoking a joint...Honestly though, her accessorizing of the Harajuku GIrls is so silly. Madonna never accessorized, she re-invented. Gwen take note.She doesn't sing much better than Britney Spears or JLo, yet people are eating her up..Buy any of Madonna's albums over this and be much more happier..."
4,A great album from a very talented woman.,"Gwen Stefanis solo album proves you can't manufacture talent. L.A.M.B is packed with fun dance pop from very talented producers.Among the highlights are The Neptunes produced Hollaback girl which sounds like a cross between Kelis MILKSHAKE and a cheerleaders chant with incredably catchy results and Bubble Pop Electric a retro-futuritic romp in which Gwen sounds like a horny Judy Jetson. Also while this may be Gwens least personal album it is very hard for Gwen to ever be impersonal in WHATCHA WAITING FOR Gwen deals with her lack of self confidence and in COOL she forges a strong friendship with an ex. So once again Gwen wins us over with her charm, personality, beauty and with her irresistable hooks. EP"
5,Gwen Stefani Is A Goddess,"I love Gwen Stefani but, like everyone, not everything she does is always amazing. This album isn't No Doubt-style. This is Gwen all the way. She doesn't rap at all. It's just the way she sings. Maybe whoever said that figured she must be rapping on ""Luxurious"" which samples the same song Biggie used in ""Bip Poppa"".Gwen Stefani's album is fun, fresh and catchy as all hell with bits and pieces of Gwen's softness thrown in. It's incredibly good to dance or workout to cause it makes you want to move all over the place.It's not a timeless masterpiece. It's not a classic. It's not gonna change your life. 'Love, Angel, Music, Baby' is just a fantastically fun album to rock to."
4,Fun Album,"While this CD might not become a classic to be enjoyed by generations to come it is a pretty fun guilty pleasure. I think it is great that she went in a different direction musically instead of just making a No Doubt album without No Doubt. You have to listen to it a couple times to appreciate it. She seems to be trying new things and not taking herself too seriously, as long as the listener doesn't take it too seriously either they should be able to find the fun it in too."
3,lord what happened?!!!!!!!!,"do you remember that ska band no doubt, headed by that funky girl with the crazy voice, pink hair and bindis? well that is all replaced now with gwen stefani, the sellout pop princess. she has it seems done everything since her ska days to become mainstream-from her band breaking up and her going solo (as many bands have done in the past decade) to losing her curvy figure and even admitting to starving herself. this album sounds no better than the other trashy pop that is played everywhere. and suprise suprise-it isnt really any different. people who would have been shunning tragic kingdom's different approach to rock will be blasting the electro-dominated beats and pop melodies of love angel music baby.but after all gwen is gwen and she has definitely influenced the teen culture in some ways so if this is the path she chooses to take, what she looses in faithful tragic kingdom followers she will gain in popped out l.a.m.b. devotees."
1,She pretty much sold out,"After listening to love.angel.music.baby for a good enough time, I've come to the conclusion that Gwen sold out. In a BIG way. I'm ashamed to actually play the cd now. The songs seem catchy at first, but that's the operative word-""first."" After a while it tends to grate on your nerves. To top it all off, seeing her parade around in her videos with her posse of ""harajuku girls"" is nauseating. It's insulting to see the way she treats them, as if they're her personal pets with the sole job of posing in the background and looking weird."
2,Blah Blah,"This album is gorgeously packaged and expertly engineered. Only problem is, there ain't much more to it. I usually love Gwen's lyrics; they are usually written from the heart and touch on some universal truths about life and love they offer her unique perspective on things. This album however has her talking about the high thread count of her sheets. I am thrilled that Gwen is successful and I wholeheartedly thinks she deserves it but give me a break. L.A.M.B has no soul. I hope the next one isn't as silly and indulgent as the first."
5,Gwen is my idol!,"Gwen Stefani's music is the best! I love Rich Girl and Hollaback girl the songs get stuck in your head so easily. This s*** is bananas, BANANAS!lol. Keep making great music Gwen. I have one of her handbags she has great fashion taste too. All Gwen Stefani fans try her line if you didn't already she has mad cool style. It's different and I like that. You always get complements with her line. Well anyway back to the album it rocks, period. If I were u I would get it. MUST HAVE!!!!!!"
3,Descent Start For Gwen,"Gwen wanted to go more for the type of music that appeals to her listening and that's ok. I just didn't find the tracks with Andre3000 to be too hot cause it was too techno sounding. I did love ""Hollaback Girl"", ""Watch'ca Waiting For"", ""Luxicious"". ""Rich Girl"" was fie with her best friend Eve. But it was an up and down album."
3,Its alright,"The first 4 songs on the cd are great but after that it was like they threw a bunch of songs on there to make it a full cd. Some of these songs just don't stand up to what you think of when you hear the name Gwen Stefani!! I was disappointed with song 5-?, but again 1-4 are good. Sorry I guess I'm just not ready for Gwen to start ""rapping""."
3,It's catchy,"Don't expect No Doubt on this album because its not. Gwen totally went on her own here. It reminded me allot of 80's band Missing Persons with Dale Bozzio and early Madonna. I loved Missing Persons, loved the 80's and love Madonna, but I'm not too sure on this album, I will say it is catchy though."
2,YUCK!!!!,"Gwen!!!! What have you done!!!?? I love you girl but this album is awful!! The first single is great and it got me excited about this album but I have been let down BIG time!!! The only other good tracks besides the lead single are 10 and 11 and thats not saying much since they sound like the were pulled off Madonna's first two albums! Madonna already did this kind of music in the 80s but the difference is....Madonna pulled it off great being the amazing powerhouse of a performer that she is. You on the other hand fall flat on your face. Look for this album to sink...and sink fast on the charts! At least we now know one thing....Gwen obviously is NOT the mastermind behind No Doubt! Bring back your boys girl cause without them your career is done. I wish all these ""younger"" female singers would stop trying to be like Madonna!!!! There is only one Madonna and no other female singer will ever reach the ICON status that she commands. Better luck next time Gwen."
1,bad,"a few simple words describe this cd:Love.Angel.Music.Baby=Bad.Very bad.Horrible.DumbBeside's Eve's performance in ""Rich Girl"" and parts of ""Hollaback Girl,"" this cd is NOT WORTH IT!"
1,Lacking A Musical Breakthrough,"I was stoked when i heard that this album was going to be a guilty pleasure 80's throwback dance album. Unfortunatly it is all guilt, no pleasure. This album is HURTING!!! I guess i was hoping for more of a Madonnaesque backbone to the lyrics or something. Even though most songs can get away without having great lyrics (even audible lyrics)because the beat is driving, i was TOTALLY distracted by the words and even her voice sometimes---which i think rocks on her other albums. The songs are juvenile in an unfun way. I'll give it a couple of more listens as long as it is in the background, while i'm vacuuming."
1,0 Stars,"buy this album and you will forever be dubbed a tasteless degenerate 21st century centrist fool. a fool who knows not of the aesthetics in art, in music, in life itself. a numb, dumb, blind, consumer... denied of life by fleeting colours, monotonous rhythms, banal melodies and appaling imagery.the other day i was on a bus... a kid next to me was enslaved in what i call the ""mindless indulgence of the senses"". she was totally absorbed in colour sound and technological imagery... fiddling with her polytonal cellphone she was bopping her head to the music blaring out from her i-pod headphones. i wanted to slap her out of it... i wanted to show her the birds that sang in the trees.- The Evil Kid"
1,"This is trash, if you like this you are not a human being and you have no soul.","I work in a health club and this trash plays over and over and over and over, and it all sounds the same and it has BS lyrics and electronic repeated beats, it brainwashes you into thinking that this kind of music is ok, when in fact music should have feeling and emotion and bring across ideas. I'm not saying all music should be technically as great as Moazrt, but music shouldn't make you want to kill yourself when you listen to it. I almost quit my job to get away from this utter nonsense, but instead I found where the radio is and smashed it with a baseball bat."
1,I'm NOT impressed!,"I was actually looking forward to this album because I like Gwen's work with No Doubt, but this album is an 11 on the obnoxious and annoying scale. Literally every song is grating and I was begging for the album to come to an end. If you're a fan of No Doubt, I doubt you'll find anything to like on this album."
1,"Terrible, just plain terrible","I got the cd based on ""What Are You Waiting For"" as well as Gwen's reputation as the lead singer of No Doubt. Right around track #6 I was ready to just stop listening. It's HORRIBLE!!!!! It lacks musical integrity and talent. ""Long Way To Go"" quite possibly is the worst song I have ever heard.Gwen, you owe me $10, an hour of my life and an ear enema."
1,Didn't like it,I am a huge fan of Gwen Stefani. I bought the cd because I liked the first single and I have bought previous cds of No Doubt. But I have to say this is the worst cd I have ever purchased and I wish I could return it. I am very disappointed about how bad the album is.
1,why? why must you torment us?,"I love the cover...it stefani's my gwen. but seriously. no doubt about it, this is garbage."
1,This lamb has went astray...,"I bought this album as a Garbage fan. Knowing that Shirley Manson has a knack for calling Gwen ""wee little lamb"" and well, it's Gwen, she rocks, come on! - - - kind of reasons I bought this. But after the first track ""What you waiting for?"", I felt deeply confused and missing the old stuff. Haha, call me one-sided. But Gwen definitely belongs with the her boys. They're something and this, this album is not...I admire the expermentation, takes balls - - - big balls. Eh..."
4,An accidental happiness,"I bought this album by accident. At first, I didn't think so much of it. Then later on, I realized its greatness. ""Danger Zone"" and ""Serious"" are weird 80s-90s-electronica combos but they make for two seriously great songs! Their catchy tune combined with their electronic sampling combined with Gwen's sweet but great voice all contributes good songs to make a great album. ""Harajuku Girls"", another one of my top favorites, is funky, catchy, and cool all at the same time. ""Rich Girls"" is also good, too. But not *everything* is top-notch, as is with any album. Tracks like ""The Real Thing"" and ""Bubble Pop Electric"" aren't that great, but are still worth listening to. All in all, a very good album. Not the most excellent thing i've ever heard, but pretty damn good. And definitely one of those things I'm happy to have bought accidentally."
4,awesome dance/electronica,"gwen pays tribute to the musical sounds of the 80's and gives them a funky modern twist that I haven't seen in such a way since madonna. Definitely check this and gwen's upcoming album out, along with madonna's new CD confessions on a dancefloor. This winter is gonna be jam packed with great electronica dance numbers from these artists"
1,Why Gwen? Why?,"I am a fan of No Doubt. I don't care for their most recent albums (Return of Saturn and Rock Steady) though. They _were_ cutting edge rock. I respected the originality of the music-lyrics, and Gwen was awesome. I knew those days were over when I heard their album ""Return of Saturn"". This album should be sold at the dollar store! Who is she trying to be? Gwen Stefani or a 36 year old bad Britney Spears? Terrible. No matter how much time, thought and effort she put into this, it doesn't show. Her obsession with the Japanese girls gets annoying after a while. The brillant thing about this album is that she's using it to promote her fashion line L.A.M.B. as well. Sorry Gwen, but I'll stick to your work in No Doubt."
3,Is this the Year of Reinvention for EVERYONE?,"Apparently it is. Including Gwen Stefani. Like the ruffled, multi-tierd skirts, Gwen has once again slapped us in the face with the cold hard reality that we must relive the electronica/synthesized hip-hop beats that infiltrated American culture 20 years ago. God help us. But with that inevitablity behind us, we can enjoy L.A.M.B. to its fullest potential by taking it for what it is: A tribute to the 80s. Bring back No Doubt."
1,"Review for ""Love. Angel. Music. Baby."" by Gwen Stefani","How is a Gwen Stefani album any different than a No Doubt album? Gwen has always done all the vocals. She tries to appeal to both R&B and punk audiences, but it just doesn't work for me. ""Hollaback Girl"" is so annoying. She doesn't do any singing in it. All she does is scream random and meaningless things like ""Bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S!"" over and over. She's trying to hard to be ghetto now. You can't just suddenly switch from a punk to a thug that quickly. That said, ""Rich Girl"" is pretty catchy. But it gets annoying quickly."
2,"Teen market well covered, did they need to have Gwen?","I was so excited when about this CD. I can't remember a time when I had to have the CD the day it came out. I love the single and have been a big No Doubt fan for a couple of years now. I have been impressed by Gwen's open, real and yes fun lyrics and was looking forward to more. I can get into most of the music on this new CD (I was a teen in the 80's after all) but am so disappointed with the lyrics on most of the songs. I enjoy American Idol and all the other thousands of teen ""artist"" like the next person. I mean they are EVERYWHERE, dime a dozen if you will. Would it have been soooooo costly for 30+ age artist to write about the world of a 30+ person? Well, Teens enjoy this gift you have been given....yet again."
3,Fun CD,"Gwen Stefani is a fun girl and she writes catchy tunes, but there's not much depth here. Not that depth is required by any means, but Gwen is an intelligent woman and I think I just expected more than ""Hollaback Girl"". I find that her music with No Doubt is far more mature and meaningful. Gwen and I are the same age and I can't relate to most of these songs. Aside from ""What You Waiting For"" and ""Cool"" I just don't get any of it. I'd like to see Gwen grow up a bit and start to write more mature songs. I think that if she can do that AND keep her talent for staying young and fun, she'd be an even bigger Megastar! I am glad I own this CD and I often play it in the car when I feel like being young and fun! :-)"
4,Really good; so many different styles,"Gwen Stefani is on a good thing. Each song is totally different but they seem to work for her. I just listened to her new song Luxurious on Z100 and I didn't know who was singing at first because it's different to the other three releases from this album. It's a great song (I love the Isley Brothers - Between the Sheets sampling in it), and she sings each song well - whether it be a fast song or slow. Cool is another great song, but I have to say that Rich Girl was (in my mind) overrated and over played on radio. Other than that, this is a great debut solo effort. I think she's going to be around for a long time to come."
3,it has ups and downs,"whatchu waiting for, cool and danger zone have some really hot beats that combine dance and rock elements of the 80's and today which is what gwen should be respected for, rather than the overrated rich girl and hollaback girl that are hip hop sounding and juevenille for 36 year old gwen. A couple other songs sound like freestyle dance music of the 80's. Her voice is so annoying and she used it much better when she was with no doubt, but it's not all that bad though the title had me wondering at first..."
4,Very adventurous,THe best songs are1.What u waiting for2.Hollaback Girl3.Harajuku Girls4.Long way to go with(Andre 3000)
1,pathetic,"Stefani pulled a Beyonce because she thought everyone wanted more of here, well I sure as hell didnt. It seems she releases a single every few weeks,which should show how greedy this woman is. The music I hear from here is just like No Doubt's later works, so I dont know what the difference is. I wish artist today, who are in a band, dont release solo cds. It should be banned. What good every came from it? Besides giving a greedy artist more money, they dont need. Music always had bad music in 60's,70's,and 80's but there was always good bands to even out the crappy music, even though only true fans bought the good music and radio over played all the crappy music. Late 90's and 2000-the death of music is upon us."
1,Should have put a parental label on this!!!!!!!!!,"I can't believe they didn't put a parental advisor on this, they ""$hit"" many many times and I bought this cd for a child and I thought they would have put the radio version on it, if it didn't have a parental label. NOT TO MENTION it was at Walmart that is supposed to censor items. So I did not listen to it past the profanity!"
1,It's like McDonalds serving sushi.,"So watered down, and there's nothing at all unique or original about it. Sure she's 'fusing' Tokyo street culture with bubblegum pop, but its so disappointing if you've ever been to Harajuku.There's just nothing authentic about it....it's like McDonalds serving sushi....there's nothing original, the aim is to satiate a financial appetite.Sure all the songs aren't looking for some sort of Japanese spin off, The main sound in 'Rich Girl' is from 'Fiddler on the Roof.' Sure its catchy, and sure Dr. Dre produced it, but the end product is just a blur of what the original was.And the marketing surrounding it. Extremely watered down and hopelessly imitated style from Yoyogi Park, obviously Stefani is still looking for her own voice, she's just going about the wrong way of doing it. Imitation is the highest form of flattery, only if that something is well imitated."
2,Disappointing,"I only liked the first four songs on this album. They were catchy and seem to stand out from the other songs.Not being overly exposed to the first three songs (like other reviwers here have said), I really considered buying this album.Now, I'm no expert on music but there's just something that I wasn't ""feeling"" in the other songs on this album.I can't picture any other song on this album being played on the radio. Also, I did detect an 80's style that some reviewers here have mentioned, so I wasn't too happy about that.I guess it was good that I was given this album on my birthday, rather than paying for it myself.Sorry, Gwen. You're a lovely girl and you've had much success but this album...I wasn't really feelin' it. Good Luck with your next one. :)"
2,Eh,"I will make this short and sweet, I did not like this album in anyway. I was impressed with the first releases that I had been hearing on the radio, so a friend let me listen to her cd. THANK GOD I didn't spend any actual money on this CD. I felt like it was all over the place, the songs didn't flow and I couldn't find a grove. I am a No Doubt fan but this just lost me, sorry."
2,No Ska here; just ads for L.A.M.B.,"While I did know to so degree what I was getting with Love. Angel. Music. Baby., I did not expect so much of the lyrics to be devoted to Gwen's fashion line. I felt a little take by purchasing a full length audio advertisement.That being said, the album is primarily chewing gum pop with catchy hooks and enjoyable songs like: What You Waiting For?, Rich Girl, Hollabeck Girl and Crash. The throw-back to Fiddler on the Roof was worth a chuckle initially!"
2,remember roula?,"remember lick it? just take that give that one hit wonder some crack and the result would look something like the mess gwen has put out. I love her with no doubt but this album is just wack! She's copied a lot of 80's music, but can't recreate the brilliance of that decade very well at all. I expected better from her."
2,oh dear,"Good for Gwen for having some fun, but its the kind of fun that should have stayed in her personal music collection or at least been allowed to marinate and develop before releasing it on a CD.This feels like a vanity project, or something she felt had to do before she missed her chance. But time limits and narcissism usually produce rubbish music.Remember Aqua and their goofy songs like ""Barbie Girl"" and ""Mr. Jones""? That's what this reminds me of...And the style of the video for ""Rich Girl"" has just underscored the similarities.I wouldn't be so harsh if this album was released by some inexperienced, untalented 18 year old, but Gwen Stefani is none of those things."
2,Maybe you should have waited a litte longer!,"Don't get me wrong I love No Doubt and Gwen Stefani, ask anyone who has seen my room (a.k.a. The Shrine), but ""Love, Angel, Music, Baby"" disapointed me a lot. I got it the day it came out and put it on right away... What Are You Waiting For? came on... yea yea, skip already heard it, and all the reast seemed to get worse... I fact the two only songs i like are A Long Way To Go ( why does everyone hate it?) and Harajuku Girls (but the obsession is a bit to big). Whatever... GWEN GET YOUR ACT TOGEATHER!!!"
2,the best thing is,"that even with her japanese obsession, many people there have no clue who she is. i was just there for a year and no one ever listened to her, owned her cd's, she was never on the radio, and there were absolutely no posters or billboards of her at all. if you're gonna pick a country to be obsessed with, pick one that knows who you are."
1,save your money,save your money - this is a lame CD - just another pop tart as seen on people magazine singing inane songs with inane lyrics.
2,what up Gwen?,"I have always loved No Doubt and Gwen!~ I dont know what happened with this CD. The first single ""what you waiting for?"" Is really good. However the rest of the album doesnt compare. I love the idea that she wanted to do a whatever/dance CD. This isnt that! The producers are all reputable and good, but it sounds like a whiny, phony Gwen! I wanted to cry!!!! She has always had her own style and this CD shows strangulation! The album is filled with bubble gummy lyrics and synthetic sound and just isnt that good. Im sorry..."
1,Pathetic,"I used to love gwen stefani and all the songs she did and especially all the no doubt songs. and when her first single ""rich girls"" came out i liked it too. Then i heard ""holla back girl"". omg. that was the worst and most pathetic and disappointing song that I have ever heard in my entire life, no joke. The Neptunes can most definitely produce better songs than that and the lyrics are terrible. just plain terrible. there is no melody and there is no point to the song. Gwen, youre not ghetto, stop acting like it. we know youre not a halla back girl. please go back to your old music and start making good music again. Holla back gurl. worst song ever."
1,Am i missing something?,"From reading the reviews, it sounds like it should be good. And I like No Doubt. But this album is terrible. Nothing memorable here. The guys in No Doubt must feel vindicated."
1,1-HIT-WONDER,"1 HIT: ""RICH GIRL""SHE IS A KIDDIE STAR*DO MORE WITH YOUR MUSIC...YOU DO WRITE WELL* ;-)"
4,pretty good,"I have liked No Doubt for awhile and was a little apprehensive about Gwen Stefani doing a solo record, but she did a good job of it. The best songs are Hollaback Girl and Long Way To Go, which features Andre 3000."
4,CD,I think the cd is great to listen to and I like the songs but it doesn't have let's say the best languege.
2,"Love, Angel, Music, Disappointment",I've been a No Doubt fan for years. In rock and ska not many women have the voice and range that Gwen does. Unfortunately she manages to do a wonderful job of hiding her talents in nearly every track of LAMB. Teaming up with hip-hop stars on most tracks has done little to showcase her wonderful voice or inspire her lyrics. The style of the album is everything from 80's Madonna to Outkast without any focus or flow. What You Waiting For is a small diamond in a lot of rough and the only reason to buy the album if you are a fan of No Doubt. The rest is totally forgetable and not worth the cash. Give Save Ferris a shot if you want a great female voice in a pop/ska package.
1,it sucks,"other than the first song, which i might add is an excellent song, the cd sucks. there are no lyrics; i believ one line is, ""THE S*IT ARE BANANAS B-A-N-A-N-A-S AND BANANAS ARE THE S*IT."" I dont know, I like to make sense of the MUSIC I listen to, if you can even bring yourself to call this MUSIC. It is one of the worst cds I have ever listened to and I strongly discourage anyone to buy it. I feel bad for those who even listen to the samples."
5,Dance Party,This is a really good cd!!!!!! Gwen Stefani goes solo on this cd and proves to be a real musician. The music is good for a party and is really danceable. Definitely buy it!!!!!
1,Oh help me,"What the (...) is this (...)?Like I never listened to No Doubt (Personally I like real rap like Westside Connection and Xzibit) but I know they were better than this.I dont own this,and never will but I've heard the singles and that f**king Hollaback Girl song,if I hear it once more,I'm going to kill myself and because of that song,I'm now scared to turn on the TV because of that song and I know you're making tons of wannabe Hip Hoppers (Like Ja Rule) happy but you're making people who like real music scared to turn on the TV/Radio and this s**t is Bananas? What the (...) is that supposed to mean?I say this album and Hollaback Girl should be banned forever because someone probably commited suicide over that song!I'm outta here"
1,never has music reached such low pathetic depths.,eating too much sweets will only give you bad teeth.this is not music. its the first phase auditioning of american idol sardined into an album. the final product being a pitiable piece of synthetic pop.its amusing to see gwen stefani treating the japanese girls on her video clips as though they were PETS.but what do you people care? so go on buy it. waste your money. what do i care?
2,Decent singles......wasted filler,"I guess I can see how the teeny boppers like this album. Yes it has 3 or 4 decent songs on it that have popped up on radio. But overall it's kind of weak. She's trying to be Madonna but that ain't happening folks. If you want a REAL album with talent and songwriting superior to what's on this album, go buy Madonna's Confessions On A Dancefloor."
4,Good Job,"I am definitely digging this album. I like that Gwen made something that is a bit different from ND. Lyrically, I think she had some fun(i.e. Crash, Hollaback Girl). Long Way To Go with Andre 3000 I thought was pretty good because it actually touches on something that is prevalent in today's society. The Real Thing(Bonus Track) lyrically sounds like ND, but with a great 80s sound. I'm quite impressed overall. This is what a side project is supposed to sound like."
4,"Good, but still kind of a let down.","I have been a big No Doubt fan for years (like most reviewers for this CD). And I have heard rumor that Gwen was going to cut the boys loose eventually. And when it finally happened, I wasn't shocked. But I am kind of let down by this CD. It has a variety of styles, some good and some not so good. Overall, it is a catchy, light and decent album. But there are a couple stinkers too. I am sure this CD will sell well enough that Gwen will make another. Hopefully she focuses her energy a little more and turns out something with some more consistency."
1,No stars needed for the music,"I bought this album without even thinking twice about it. I love Gwen and everything she's done with No Doubt. I love her lyrics especially. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed with this CD. I listened to it once and couldn't believe my ears. I can't believe this is the same person. It's her voice, but someone else's soul. This CD gets one star, but only because it's Gwen. I know she's the one responsible for this (trash), but she still kicks a** and I know someday she'll come out with something worth listening to. Oh- and I'm giving this CD away."
1,Grow Up,"I think this is one of the most shallowest albums I have ever listened to in my life. Whats even more ""tragic"" is that it comes from a 37 year old woman. You cant write and you sing even worse. Go back to No Doubt!"
4,Fresh....old......new,"It is almost impossible to describe this album. We all knew Gwen had trouble getting through the album with doubts and hesitation. But the album is nice. Yes, very retro pop and very Blondie-esque but how can you get mad at an artist that takes risks. If she had come out with a predictable album, we would all have doubted her creativity. So this was the best route for her to take. I love Luxurious - the slowed down Isley Bros and for you new schoolers Biggie Smalls sample very sexy and she fits it well. The new single is also very catchy and it captures of Gwen felt about making this album. Of course I love the Andre songs and the Dre produced one. It's a wickedly good album that definitely deserves more than one listen. It's fun pop and last but not least-experimental!"
4,Gwen Is Great,"This is a really good album to listen to when you just want to kick back, relax, and not take things so seriously. Don't overanalyze the lyrics because they aren't deep or moving in any way. It is just pure fun to listen to. The stand out tracks for me were Cool (the main reason I got the album), The Real Thing, Luxurious, Rich Girl, and Serious. I gave four stars because I didn't care for Bubble Gum Electric, Hollaback Girl, Harajuku Girls, and Long Way To Go."
2,What happened?!,What is this? How could someone go from the music No Doubt makes to THIS. No comparison. The only reason I even gave it a 2 was because...well I can't remember which one it was but there was one song I liked.I still can't believe she made this. Gwen has such a cool voice... sounds much better with No doubt though.
1,ugh what a travesty,"this is sad.i knew i should have sampled some of the tracks besides ""what you waiting for""for those of us who enjoyed gwen's rock edge... that era is over.if you enjoy packaged synth pop that could easily be mistaken for any other pop star, then this album is perfect for you. it'll fit perfectly between your ashlee simpson and hilary duff albums.but for those of us who were holding Gwen to a higher standard, yeah. i couldn't even listen to the tracks all the way through."
1,Painful to Listen to...,Gwen Stefani should have stuck with No Doubt. End of story. I used to be the biggest No Doubt fan back in the days of Tragic Kingdom the magic ended with Rock Steady. She's turned into a poppy singer whos more hip hop than ska.No Doubt fans DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM I hated it so bad I cried...no kidding. The lyrics make absolutly no sence whatsoever. want a sample...I'm antsyBUBBLE POP ELECTRIC pansiesMy sweet tooth I want your candyThe Queen Of England would say it randymaybe I'm just dumb here but I didn't get a word of thatDon't waste your time or money
1,"Gwen Stefani : ""Love, Angel, Music, Baby""","* - ONE STAR-------------What ever happened to Gwen???...Or No Doubt for that matter???They went from ""Return Of Saturn"", which was incredible. Then they go out and release a complete pile of garbage with ""Rock Steady"". This is obviously the direction Gwen decided to stick with....This girl use to be a great rocker, and now all of a sudden she's a hip-hopper. Very sad. I'm sorry, but this isn't the way I remember Gwen, and I have a very hard time understanding why she changed so drastically, and so quickly. She needs to get back to her roots....ROCK!!!I absolutely hate her new image. I'm lost for words...."
2,eh,"the c.d. is bland. the real thing is the highlight of the album and everything else is like. blah. what you waiting for sounds corny the first few times you listen to it, then gets good, then gets corny again. rich girl is the most catchiest song. and harajuku girls is like a joke. and nothing else sticks out."
3,Not what I was waiting for...,"Well since the eighties are ""cool"" again, I guess everyone has to cash in, even Gwen. Heavy Sigh. No Doubt is probably the only band I was listening to in high school that I'm still listening to today, they stood the test of time. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect a No Doubt album, but I did expect a little less mass produced crap. There are some good songs on here; I loved ""Cool"", ""Serious"", and ""Danger Zone"". Her current single, ""What are you waiting for"" is greatness but the rest of the album is just irritating. Her interest in the Harajuku Girls is odd, they kind of look like her servants on the cover...but whatever. I'm not a fan of rap either, and ""this S#! % is Bananas"" really rubbed me wrong. This album is a good dancy pop album, as long as you don't put too much stock in the lyrics and don't expect anything life altering. If you really want a good throw back to the eighties, check out The Killers - Hot Fuss."
3,I wanna be a rich girl....,"Gwen Stefani may be getting a little too big for her britches. This album showed much promise based on the first single, ""What You Waiting For?"". However, the newest song, ""Rich Girl"" is MUCH better, and is the highlight of the whole album. After that, the album falls flat on its face, and no amount of resucitation can help it. I was really hoping for more songs similar to ""Hella Good"" or ""Hey Baby"", but it was just not meant to be. Maybe I dislike it because Gwen harkens back to early '80s fare for inspiration, which I can't stand. I don't know. I just believe this album's success or failure is very dependent on a certain musical taste. If you don't like early '80s dance music, you will be very disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I admired Gwen Stefani and liked No Doubt, so I was eager to buy and listen to her solo effort. Although ""What You Waiting For"" and some of the songs near then end are good, I would say most of the album is pretty bad. ""Rich Girl"" is very annoying and corny. Same with ""Luxiourious."" I'm not one of those people who was expecting her album to sound like No Doubt, and I thought when I heard her first single that I would really like her new style and album. But it's like she's trying to do too much at once to appeal to too many different people.Update: Six years later I can say ""Hollerback Girl"" has grown on me, and I kind of like it, but, I never listened much to the rest of the album after I first bought it. Still cannot stand ""Rich Girl."" Still LOVING ""What You Waiting For."""
4,"Entertaining, but some songs disappointing","There were enough quality tracks to make this CD a worth while purchase, and some good surprises. However, a couple songs are really bad - so just don't expect this to be a CD that you play top to bottom."
3,ok,"some songs r good like rich girl, cool, and hollaback girl.but they got old really fast. i like songs u can dance to , but these so aren't dancing tunes."
1,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of No Doubt for a long time, so I was rather excited to hear something from Gwen. Let's just say, I'm not impressed. The music and lyrics are very corny and predictable. I don't think this record really showcases her real talents. Also, the way she objectifies Harajuku women is terrible. She refers to them as toys or accessories to have rather than real friends or influences. ""I'm gonna get me some Harajuku girls"" Who ""gets"" a person. I'd rather hear name dropping than refering to these women as a brand. I hope the remaining members of No Doubt come up with something better..."
1,Umm....,"I like No Doubt. No Doubt has way better songs than the stuff on here. I'm so mad that I wasted my money on this piece of crap. The only songs that I find enjoyable are: 'What You Waiting For', and 'Rich Girl'."
1,WHY GWEN??? WHY????,"Why, Gwen? No Doubt was a cool ska pop rock band from the 90's...They got many cool songs like SPIDER WEBS and EXCUSE ME MR, and they even got some attitude too...Gwen solo became some kind of rapper?!?Really bad...But i like NO DOUBT..."
2,I wish i had not bought this.,"I own this cd. I wish i had not bought it.Only 3 of these songs are songs i like.1 What you waiting for (so commercial ...)2 Rich girl (even though its a revised version of a Fiddler on the Roof song.3 Danger Zone. (Technopop.)the others are just....ok.I have problems with Harajuku Girls and Long way to go.Also There are two songs about sex in the backseat ,wow...I wish i'd just bought the mp3s of the songs i liked."
5,"And now for something completely different: a review geared toward visual, mixed-media artists","I love the music, the beat's swell, and you can dance to it.But here, I'd like to speak to the design and presentation of this cd. It rocks my world. You get more than just a cd; there's a fab, sturdy and pretty velcro closure traveling cd case with room for 12 faves and a cunning small hardcover book with slipcover, which showcases all the lyrics in the style of illuminated manuscripts and includes photos and original Shinjuko illustrations.If I were a recording musician, this is a style of presentation I would emulate. As a mixed-media narrative artist, I wish all cds were this gorgeous."
2,ill be fair,"besides stealing that one song If i was a rich girl which is from Fiddler on the Roof, she is not original at all. heard this million times over again.but i give her credit for being smart. she knows what people nowadays want. she knows what sounds catchy for them. she knows how to portray her image.So even though shes a greedy whore and a prostitute(which means she sacrifices her morals for benefits)she knows the market. she knows what sells and what doesnt."
1,Doubtful,"Despite the hype, this effort fails to live up to expectations.Beacon-Tragic-Saturn-Rock, the goddess's dulcet intonations are sacrificed on the altar of pop-ularity."
1,Crap!,From a good band to a sell out in it for the money! Utter crap!! She is a discrace to No Doubt! That is all I have to say.
1,No doubt - this CD sucks.,"Gays and teenie boppers may like this, but Gwen shouldn't give up her day job with ND. Just terrible."
3,Grows on you,"When I first heard the whole CD, I must admit I was not feeling it. But after a few times, it really grew on me and now I'm totally digging it. Yeah, the lyrics are kinda weak and it's not the most profound thing I ever heard, but it's fun. Recommend it while it's still cheap."
1,grefan,"Love, Angel, Music, Baby . . . sucks big time. I was expecting a really cool cd from Gwen Stefani, because she was/is the lead singer of No Doubt. The song 'Rich Girl' is retarded, as well is 'Harajuku Girls'. The first track, 'What You Waiting For?' is the only good one on the cd. And Sorry, but I can't relate to shopping at Vivienne Westwood. Love ya Gwen, but next time keep it real!"
1,Flaming Garbage,This album is a piece of sh*t. There is one other words to describe this album.Useless Pop.
1,"1 star b/c there is no ""zero stars""","Just stinks. Gwen, how juvenile and utterly childish. Big disappointment and big waste of money."
4,Takes more than one listen.,"First when I listened to this record I thought it was horrible with the exception of ""Luxurious"" and ""The Real Thing"".Give it more than one listen and try to appreciate the 80's. I did and now I found this album pretty addictive. This album definitely sounds very different from No Doubt, but believe me, if you like pop, this will definitely grow on ya."
3,This S**t Is Bananas!,"I expected a masterpiece from Gwen! The critics are blown away by this album but the fans arent. Bottom line is the songs are very different back to back, the lyrics are pretty :(, the beats can get annoying but are fun, and she mentions the Harajuku Girls a bit too much.The Cd has to be my favourite at the moment though, I mean Destinys childs latest is hardly a winner, so this album is just -ok. The 5 of the first 7 tracks are the stand outs.I thought Gwen was going to release a huge grammy winning masterpiece, maybe not.Anyways, the best tracks are:What You Waitin' For?Rich Girl Featuring EVEHollaback Girl , despite its horrible lyrics!Bubble Pop Electric Featuring Johnny Vulture (Aka Andre 3000)And Harajuku GirlsFar from a masterpiece but not a complete disaster."
3,She's Irresistable,"She's cute, sassy, fun, fashionable, and a little strange. This is Gwen Stefani's personality, and this is exactly what her debut solo album represents. I loved this album, but in some instances I felt that Gwen may have tried a little to hard for the ""uniquely strange"" effect. Songs like ""Harajuku Girls"" and ""Luxurious"" seem to be there for the effect, to make her seem a little off, but she doesn't seem to pull it off, its obvious that she's trying too hard. The rest of the album is perfection, it shows Gwen better than she could have ever been with No Doubt. Hot tracks like ""Bubble Pop Electric"", ""Serious"", ""Crash"", and ""Danger Zone"" all deliver solid dance fun effects. I don't think Gwen will ever have the same great magnitude as Madonna, but I have a feeling that Gwen Stefani will be around for a while, and I'm not complaining about that."
2,????????????????????????????????????????????,"All it sounded like it was 80's,Madonna,Britney Spears, and Hilary Duff.The one that I liked was What you waiting for.WHAT HAPPENED????????????????????????????"
2,I Prefer The Old Gwen... This One Is Annoying,"I am a huge No Doubt fan , not huge but I have some their music. Ever since Gwen left the band she has changed completely. She seems to have an attitude like she all that or she better now that she out of the band.The music from No Doubt was intelligent , original and suited her voice better. On Hollaback Girl and numerous other songs , the lyrics are childish and her voice just sounds annoying. I enjoyed her voice in No Doubt , but this R/B meets 80's dance and rap annoys me. I realize I am being redundant on the word annoying , but thats the only word to describe this album.Even the album cover , she looks so trashy and stuck up , she wasnt like that in No Doubt. She must remember it was her band as well that brought her to the point she is now.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 , because I cant hate her cuz she used to be so cool in the past. And cuz ""Harajuku Girls ""( even though I dunt get what the hell it means, has a weird beat to it that I like )"
1,HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED,"I was highly disappointed when I heard Gwen's new CD. Only one song, HoLLaback girl was ok- even this song is not enjoyable unless scantlly clad women are parading around like in the video. Gwen is a SELLOUT who went totally mainstream. I liked her music because I didnt get the generic 50 cent beat that everything else has now a day, now look whats shes done! if she doesnt change her style back 2 being more unique, she will loose a dedicated fan whose stuck by her since (Total Hate) one of her garage band singles."
2,"L.A.M.E. is more like it, 2 stars for 4 good songs","What You Waiting For? - A+: I like the techno sounds to it. The lyrics are cool.2. Rich Girl - B: It took awhile but I did like it. Now I really like it because it never seems to get old.3. Hollaback Girl - C-: Great beat ruined with stupid lyrics.4. Cool - A: One of the better songs.5. Bubble Pop Electric - F: You're kidding me.6. Luxurious - F: How do people like this song? This song has the worst lyrics I've ever heard.7. Harajuku Girls - F: Alright, it's funny, but it's not music.8. Crash - F: Poor 80's attempt.9. The Real Thing - C+: It's okay. It would have been a better ballad with the instrument whatever in the beginning, imo.10. Serious - C: I don't remember this song so it must of just been average.11. Danger Zone - A+: The only great song after ""Cool"". This song sort of reminds me of No Doubt.12. Long Way To Go - F: Umm...lol, uhh.....no."
3,Gwen has a 'long way to go',"Well... I think that everyone expects Gwen Stefani to make a cd like her No Doubt records. That hasn't happened here! The 80s were bad enough and they shouldn't be brought back in a 2004 pop record. As much as these songs are fun and sometimes serious in subject matter, they weren't collectively produced well. There's a lot of producers here (all of them good) but it seems this album doesn't mesh. The songs are good though! Number of songs I like: 5-6 out of 12>Favorite Tracks: ""Rich Girl"", ""Long Way To Go"", ""What You Waiting For?"", ""Bubble Pop Electric"", ""Cool"", ""Harajuku Girls"""
1,Bananas?????,"What I don't get here is that people actually buy this stuff? Ok these lyrics are more pathetic than Limp Bizkit mabey even more pathetic than Britney Spears. The Holla Back girl song is one of the worst songs of all time(and the video as well) What is with the highschool theme, arent you to old for that? Oh yea and I have to say this too ""YOU AREN'T GHETTO!!!!"" and neither are the harujuku girls. The one who made me love No Doubt also ruined it(Rock Steady)and it's never comming back."
4,Now what I was expecting but good for the style,"I was expecting something more mature from Gwen Stefani but this Cd is more of a punk Disco, not really my cup of tea. I think though for the Genre the music is pretty orignial and good. Harajuku girls is my favorite out of the Cd. I spent some time in Harajiku last Christmas while on a business trip so I can relate to lyrics and the spirit of the ,song. I know there are some misguided people here that think that type of song is racist but believe me Japanese would be very proud of the music because it borrows from the Japanese pop music scene and I am confident it would be a big hit in japan. In fact the Cd is somewhat influenced by it in the same way Paul Simon's Greaceland was influenced by the South African music scene."
3,Question about tracks,"I haven't heard the whole album, just bits and pieces from being around in stores and stuff, but the track ""Rich Girl"" with Eve sounds a lot like Krystal Harris' ""If I Were a Rich Girl"" ... I heard it when she toured with the Backstreet Boys years ago, then all of a sudden it was coming out of a speaker at HMV with a different singer attached to it. Anyone know what's up with that? The two tracks are lyrically and musically the same."
3,No Doubt Sound Missed,"I am a big No Doubt fan and have followed their career throughout the 90's. I also appreciated Gwen Stefani's duets with Moby for ""South Side"" and with Eve for ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind."" So I was thrilled when it was announced that Gwen would come out with a solo album.I love the first single ""What You Waiting For?"" and after a couple of listening sessions I've come to really like ""Rich Girl,"" and ""Hollaback Girl,"" but the rest of the album leaves something to be desired. Like other reviewers, I find this album disjointed, because it appears that Stefani will try any genre and style. I appreciate that No Doubt did try other genres and styles too and didn't just stick with Ska and New Wave, but at least their albums were thematic for example ""Rock Steady"" with its retro/reggae sound. I'm glad that Gwen has the courage to branch out and I eagerly await her next project which hopefully will be more cohesive."
3,"I love rich girl, but....","Well, what a change. I guess she was trying to reinvent herself. I love her song 'rich girl' and all the rest are just a waste of cd space. She tried something new and that's great, but sometimes the same old thing is still great. It used to be my dad and i both liked her, now my dad hates her new music and i have found myself to have memorized 'rich girl'. Better luck in the future, stefani!"
2,"Huge disappointment, barely tolerable","I've been a No Doubt fan since 1993 and I love Gwen Stefani. I even met her once and she's really nice and beautiful. The best song is ""What you waitnig for"". I can't believe some of the other songs. I've listened to the albumn maybe three times all the way through and it's not growing on me, nor do I have the desire put myself through that again. The lyrics are a joke and it just doesn't fit. Don't get me wrong, it a FUN albumn, it just not anything I would expect from her. I know that artists grow and change, but this is backsliding. This albumn is selling ""Gwen Stefani"" not her music or talent. I hope this was a one time only thing and that her next is with the band or at least with some type of realness to her music or insight."
1,Musical Equivalent of a Budweiser Ad,"I wanted to like this album, but do not. Lyrics are far too shallow and repetitive, songs are poorly written and may do okay as singles, but make for a jerky, start-and-stop album.And I will say--naming your record after your handbags is not cool. Given Ms. Stefani's retail ambitions and their ubiquitous presence in the songs, I expect that ""Harajuku Girls - The Cologne"" will be appearing in stores shortly.I can see where mainstream dance music party people would like this--I'm being fair there. But serious music lovers will find this collecting dust on their shelves after a listen or two."
5,Gwen Stefani: Love. Angel. Music. Baby.,"""Love Angel Music Baby"" is Gwen Stefani's debut record. All I have to say is WHOA! Each song is a hit and I find myself dancing along in my seat to the insanely rhythm. There are no filler songs. All are 120% thriller, and I bet you can't control dancing (even if it's just tapping your hand against your leg) to at least one of the songs. This is a really good cd, and I recommend it to anyone who likes No Doubt, who Gwen was a member, then she went solo."
1,Worthless,"Poor Gwen is rapidly running out of subcultures to leech from so this latest album seems to be a spray and pray of styles, hoping that one of them will stick.I predict: the most popular track will be the next ""style vision"" that she has. Either she'll continue to try and attach herself to the Japanese culture becoming a dried up bellweather of lackluster American talent against the likes of Kahimie and Puffy. Perhaps the more R&B;/hip hoppy tracks will be the popular ones and she'll bring back ghettofabulous, much to the horror of *everyone*.In any event, this CD is a waste of money filled with watered down ""appreciative"" (read: plagiarized) sounds from far more talented artists. Buy the originals instead."
4,Gwen's best,"Gwen has come a long way from No Doubt, and this album shows her growth as both a person and musican.Great lyrics,great beat,and great music...POERIOD. The only fault here is the hipity hop she threw in, (Andre 3000) I personaly don't care much for that stuff.But overall this is a fantastic new chapter in Gwen's life and I highly recommend this.100 stars!!"
1,Whaaaaaaat!!?!!?!?!?!?,"I loved No Doubt. I mean a lot. I don't know how people find this album acceptable. I will list every reason why you shouldnt purchase this album.1) The song Hollaback Girl. WTF!!!2) Every other song on this album. The last thing we need is more of that Hip Hop Dance Crap, a path that many formerly talented artists have chosen.3) We know you're a madonna look alike. But seriously, be original and don't be like her."
1,This made my ears hurt.,"Is Gwen so self absorbed and self obsessed that she has nothing better to say? My 12 year old can write deeper lyrics than this crap she is selling, I find it hard to believe with her life experiences and travels the only thing she can come up with is fashion and style? And once you are over the shock of the poor lyrics, you realize the music itself is just horrible.I can see now why she went solo, No Doubt members would have never agreed to play this. She will ""No Doubt"" be embarrased a few years from now for even trying to call this art. I'm embarrased for her."
1,GOT YO MILLION $ CONTRACT-NOW WE'RE WAITIN' FOR A GOOD TRACK,"OK Gwen. What are you thinking? You put out this killer first single and then have the nerve to insult your following with this mess of an album. I mean, come Gwennie! Figure out who you are! You're not Snoop Dog. You're not Madonna. And you're not some unbearable new wave act. You're a rock chick. You don't have to go ghetto to sell an album."
1,"Original, you say??? NO WAY.","Gwen Stefani's cd...I saw it referred to as ""original"". Are you joking? It is anything BUT original. It is nothing more than basic tunes and beats that have already been done many times before by other artists. I can't see this album as something that anyone who isn't a juvenile would listen to. And I do find the ""I am the Queen, you are the subjects"" mentality of this music towards Japanese girls and Japanese culture to be gauche...Get over yourself, Gwen. Having a clothing line is one thing. But it sounds as if she is EXPECTING to be praised and glorified for it. Or something....I have one defining word for this album.....WHATEVER."
5,Love. Amazing.Music. Baby!!,"At first I thought that I wouldn't like the album, but the minute I heard ""what are you waiting for"" and ""rich girl"" I was hooked! Her album is amazing! Her style of music totally unique. If you were to ask me what genre of music she sings, I couldn't tell you. It isn't Pop, Rock, Alternative, R&B;, or anything else, it's just Gwen! She has created a new type of music that will take the world by storm.I have to say that the best songs on this album are ""What Are You Waiting For"", ""Rich Girl"", ""Harajuku Girls"", ""Bubble. Pop. Electric."", ""Danger Zone"", ""Hollaback Girl, and, well... all of them. This is definately a CD that you will never get tired of. I can hardly wait for her next album!"
1,It's Just a shame...,Sorry. I thought this album would be better. Gwen has such an amazing singing voice and such great stage presence and... and not one bit of that comes through on her solo debut. It was an incredible dissapointment to me.
4,"Good songs, but filthy language ruined it","I bought this CD because I really like most of the songs on this album, and we are fans of Gwen Stefani. However, we were deeply disappointed when we went to play ""Hollaback Girl,"" which my five-year-old daughter had heard many times on the radio and loved, only to hear the ""s"" word repeatedly. And I don't mean once or twice.. it was all through the song. So, we can no longer listen to that song in my car when the children are with us.. and I really don't enjoy listening to her filthy mouth when I'm alone. Why did she do this? It ruined a perfectly great song - and I feel it is deceiving to get people really pumped up about a song on the radio (the ""clean"" version), but that's not what you get when you buy this CD. There are a handful of other radio hits onthis album too."
3,She has guts,"Gwen Stefani was way better back when she started No Doubt. Soon on she just went down then went solo and made this. ""Rich Girl"" is a bit of annoying and always played. ""Hollaback Girl"" sounds like it would be a rap song. She has guts to be songwriting and still singing, thats okay. But shes not so good anymore. If I could pick between her now or No Doubt back in the 90s I would have to pick No Doubt back then, even though I never did find myself into her music but she has guts to still be singing and songwriting."
3,BIG disappointment,"When I heard that Gwen was putting out a solo Cd I was counting down the days until it came out, but after I listened to it I was really let down. The songs' beats are annoying and the lyrics are horriable. Almost as bad as that band who sang, "" I like girls who wear abercrombie and fitch."" Not as bad but pretty close."
2,Madonna lite,"Gwen Stefani is to what Madonna like Usher thinks he is to Michael Jackson which neither one them really aren't. Usher doesn't have the Voice or the proper Material to even try to make a Claim&the same goes for Stefani when it comes to Madonna. Stefani is vocally challenged&the Music here sounds like Post""Like a Virgin"" Era Madonna but minus the Right Hit to truly make it work. Stefani has the Star ""IT"" vibe but not the voice or the right Material to fully reach that next level. much Like Usher just Emulating someone you grew up on doesn't mean you Equal them in Quality."
1,Gwen Stefani Is Done,"After 11 or so impossible years of greatness, No Doubt and Gwen Stefani are finally finished. Although I respect No Doubt, the band, Gwen has finally screwed herself with this album, the Pepsi ads and the diva 'tude. I almost puked the third time I saw the Pepsi ad in which this teenage girl leers in awe at Gwen walking by with her friend, as if she were some idol. PUH-LEASE! The music on this CD is pretty bad, and I like Gwen Stefani too...when she's singing with No Doubt. And the obsession with the Harajuku girls IS scary. She reminds me of the freaks I took Japanese with in college. I also don't understand her obsession with West Indian music. She's really butchering it. She doesn't really understand it. Please, drop it. I don't recommend this album. It's sad to know that all great things must come to an end."
2,No that great,"This album isn't that worth buying. If you have an Ipod, then download the only GOOD songs. Rich Girl, Hollaback Girl are the best. There should be more songs like that. I used 2 like Gwen. Now, she's not all that good. Only a few songs are worth buying the album. Don't waste your money."
2,"Gwen, your career without No Doubt is Doubtful","Okay, this album sucks ass. It's really really bad. Sort of like when Madonna started trying to focus on her SINGING, rapping (what a joke) and guitar playing instead of just doing what she does best in her American Life album. I don't even know WHAT Gwen is going for in this one - to me it seem incomprehensible? The songs are simple and silly and for the most part repetetive and annoying. Gwen, stick with the band. They really made you sound SO much better!"
4,Great First Album,Though I prefered No Doubt I think that Gwen new album is great with its genre jumping from the rocking 'What you Waiting For?' to the alternative new sound of 'Harajuku Girls' Gwen Is a great artist. If you like this then I'd recommend a few No Doubt albums (Particularly Return of Satan and Rock Steady)
4,Warning: New Order only play one riff on ENTIRE ALBUM!!,"I was so happy to hear that Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook, from arguably one of the greatest bands of all time,Joy Division and New Order, were going to be appearing on an album some from blonde singer from a band called 'No Doubt'.Imagine my disappointment when I found out they only appear on ONE SONG! And all they do is one bass riff a few times! And Bernard plays some guitar for about three seconds in the break!And it doesn't even sound like him. I felt [...] and cheated.This Gwen lady made a big mistake, they should have been all over the album, and they should have written the songs too.Anyway, this album is way better then the poppy hip-hop and boring, unoriginal R&B; that making top 40 radio unlistenable. 'What You Waiting For' is seriously the only song on the radio other then Modest Mouse that I can stand, and that's pretty bad.So for that I give this album four stars. This Gwen Stefani girl has a bright future ahead of her."
5,Incredible from Start to Finish,"This album is absolutely amazing. The ethnicity found throughout on each track is great. If you aren't hooked by her first single, you are still bound to find something to enjoy on this album. I am a very picky person when it comes to music, so an album has to be really good in order for me to write a review. The only track to watch out of is ""Harajuku Girls"". It's a little weird for me:)"
2,Not worth it--spend your 14 dollars on something else,"Prior to listening to all the songs on L.A.M.B., I wondered why it received so many bad reviews. I had heard the first 4 songs on the radio and thought they were okay. ""Cool"" was my favorite of the four, but then I heard the whole album and understood. This album received so many bad reviews because it IS bad. On L.A.M.B., Gwen decided to go on a limb and branch out from her ska roots. Although this album is basically pop, some songs have an underlying techno beat. So maybe this review is somewhat biased because I hate techno. Anyway, not only do the songs suck, but the lyrics are crappy, meaningless, and not to mention, annoyingly repetitive."
3,What a SUPRISE CD!,"when i listened to this CD i was so suprised1 because...the music is from every genre! it's crazy2 because...they lyrics are just weird. but it's gwen stefani..she's weird...and her lyrics definitely reflect her personality.i really liked listening to this CD though, it's a different style and interesting. the lyrics are humorous, especially Hollaback Girl and Bubble Pop Electric. if you liked What You Waitin For? then you'll definitely like the CD. What You Waitin For is probably my least fav song on the CD and it's a pretty good song.definitely a different style from the original No Doubt, but it's still a worthy CD to buy. the only thing i truly dislike about the CD is the whole Harajuku girl obsession. it's really creepy...but if it weren't for that, the CD would be a 4!"
3,Weird...So weird,"I love Gwen, and I love No Doubt, but I'm not really sure what she was trying to do with this album. I liked the single ""whatcha waiting for,"" and its creativity, but I believe the rest of the album falls short. Is Gwen trying to be a Ghetto Superstar?? Is she trying to rap?? What?"
3,No Doubt about it,"This would get 5 stars if it was released in 87 but...It's very apparent that Gwen worked hard to separate her solo release from anything she and her bandmates, NO DOUBT, had released before; It's almost too apparent. The fact that it's over-saturated with 80's influence makes it difficult to listen to over and over again. The Cd is pure Stefani though and she laces every track with her signature style and flavor so it gets 3stars alone for that. But surprisingly the best songs are the very mainstream ones like the Dr Dre produced Rich Girl (sample) and What You Waiting For...and there isn't any heavy or deep track. And while no one probably expected any similar song to ""Don't Speak"" even the upbeat, party tracks dont compare to ""it's my life"" or ""Hey Baby"" other NO DOUBT songs. Overall a good cd but it's more bubbly and poppy than i expected. No Doubt lovers probably would be disappointed but 80s fans and Gwen fans will probably love it....for a little while anyway."
3,Hot and Not,This is a great CD when the radio is rotating it. But once you buy it is grows cold quick. It has a generic rap feel to it that makes it a safe purchase for fans that make claims to not get into rap but still want to be apart of what is hip in the now.However this is not a CD that will be played in the next 10 years or 10 months and give you the same affect. No Doubt has more stay power than her solo creations(there I have said it).I dont know her direction but I dont want to be led by the blind. Listen in advance and have a friend burn the highlights but keep a tissue nearby it because the dust on it will make you sneeze in a few weeks.
1,Horrible Suicidal Torture S**t,"If I hear god damn Hollaback Girl once more,I'll jump off a cliff and I bet I wont be the 1st to do so and Gwen Stefani and the DJs should be ashamed for making so many people suicidal"
5,Progressive Bliss,"Aghora is without a doubt a strong force in progressive metal with inspirations to spare. Their riffs range from slap in the face type of aggressiveness, to a melodic journey through your mind. Sean Malone and Sean Reinertare extremely tight on their rythem sections, due to an already established history together in Cyinc and Gordian Knot. Female vocalist Danishta fills Aghora with a beautiful voice unlike any other, taking listeners to a whole another world while listening to the aggressive band. This CD is a must have for the addictive progressive listener with many diverse additions."
4,A new idea!,"Even years after Cynic, no one really noticed the influence they made in extreme music and no one really dared to equal the complexity. So after all these years, are there any bands that have felt the impact this band made? YES! Aghora is one of these bands. Close ties with ex-Cynic members Sean Malone and Sean Reinert, Aghora sort of takes the stage where Cynic died off. Why did I rate this album 4 stars? Because to me it isn't as well crafted as Cynic was back in 93 but also, instead the rough, brutal vocals that are typical in extreme music, Aghora have taken another approach with the soft singing (and in my opinion not very good) vocals of Danishta Rivero. Nevertheless a step up in the progressive food chain and I enjoy this band for it. Fans of Cynic will not be dissapointed."
2,Valentine's Day is MUCH Better!,I didn't really like this movie. Valentine's Day is much better. Rent this movie first to see if you like it.
5,LOTS OF STARS!!,"I really liked this movie. It was entertaining because of the several plots going on at the same time. Very fast moving. Loved the Michelle Pfeiffer's role, such a different character from what she normally plays. Also, the pairing of Jon Bon Jovi and Katherine Heigl was very interesting!! Also, liked that Lea Michelle got to strut her vocal talent in the movie.VERY GOOD MOVIE!!!"
2,Another All Star Cast Holiday Romp,"New Year's Eve is a by the book romantic comedy brought to from the same team that made Valentine's Day. Instead of Los Angeles, the scene is NYC with the plot revolving around the traditional dropping of the ball in Times Square. Director Gary Marshall has assembled another all star cast (including a cameo by his sister Penny who delivers one of the funnier lines in the movie) who mug their way through a drippy plot. The appeal to act in this film by so many great actors like Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Hallee Berry, Michelle Pfeiffer and the like must be the campy fun they must have had on the set (the closing credits with outtakes and bloopers is funnier than the actual movie). One example is Matthew Broderick making a brief appearance as a Mr. Bullerton (get it, haha) and hamming his way through his lines as a big muckety muck. The film could be worse and is a harmless way to spend two hours."
3,Light entertainment.,"Another film from Garry Marshall with many stars and several unrelated (and some related) storylines, this time surrounding New Year's Eve. This is a romantic- comedy that actually does contain a little of each, with a bit of depth in a couple of the performances. The stories each differ, and in some way members of the audience may relate to a particular one that somehow is relevant to their experiences. Due to the brevity of the differing plots, there is no strong emotional connection for the viewer with any of them, but for light entertainment on a holiday weekend, New Year's Eve is one that you might want to check out."
4,Great Holiday Movie,"This movie was recommended to me by family. My 39-year old daughter AND my 18-year old grandson each spoke highly of the film. They each have very different tastes in movies so I was intrigued enough to see the movie. I was not disappointed. Well acted, good story line with a nice blend of mild drama, romance and comedy. We watch several holiday movies every year and I have added this one to our ""holiday library."""
1,I HATE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY!!!,"SOO MAD BECAUSE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPIES ARE ""NOT ELIGIBLE TO REDEEM IN MY REGION""???!!!! ALL OTHER MOVIES SPECIALLY THE DISNEY ONES HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS!! I HAVE ABOUT 4 MOVIES THAT CAME WITH UV THAT I CANT REDEEM! JUST PUT A DIGITAL COPY TO REDEEM IN THE MOVIE AND DONT GO FANCY WITH BELLS AND WHISTLES JUST GIVE US A REGULAR DIGITAL COPY!AND WHAT A STUPID NAME!"
1,Literally the worst movie ever made.,"I get the irony of using the cliche ""worst. movie. ever."" to describe this cliche ridden pile of trash, so don't point it out.I left the theater smiling, but only because I was so dumbfounded I couldn't help but laugh at how horrible this movie actually is, I just couldn't wrap my head around it. I can easily imagine it being written on Dec 29th, filmed over the next two days, and shipped to theaters on New Years day, thats how little thought went into this production. They don't even attempt to hide the cliches used to try and hold this thing together, one character's main dilema is that he isn't prepared for his ""big company speech,"" another is a grizzled old man whos dying wish is to see the stupid ball drop for some reason...It may actually be worth the $20, just so you can show it to young aspiring screenwriters and directors and give them hope that no matter how talentless they may be, they might still suceed in hollywood."
3,It was OK......,What made this movie enjoyable for me was that Josh Duhamel was in it. If it had not been for him being in this movie I would give it 2 1/2 stars. His story was the only one I cared to watch and wondering which woman he was going to meet til the end.
4,Surprisingly Charming,"I, obviously, let my wife pick the movie. I was happy I did. This is a return to classic Gary Marshall, smiles and laughs throughout and a warm feeling of optimism when it's over."
2,"so lame, i had to stop the movie to vent","i have a high threshold for bad rom coms but this one is so awful that in the first 2 minutes, i knew it was gonna suck. i was right, not 10 minutes in, i was contemplating just giving up on the movie and watch something else instead. disappointed is an understatement. avoid this movie or waste time at your own peril."
4,entertainment,All I was after was entertainment and I got what I was looking for. I would watch this movie again
2,Expected more,"With such incredible cast, I had high expectations from this movie. It was kind of boring and predictable. But let me pass the time while traveling."
4,movie,Had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Was very light and funny to watch the characters going through their experiences.
3,Love the Move but don't buy UltraViolet Copies,"This movie is cute following in the footsteps of Valentine's Day and Love Actually in an all star case with intertwined stories. However, do not buy this if you want to watch it through itunes and your Apple device. The ultraviolet copy will not load into this software and you have paid for something you must use another app for."
3,Mediocre Although Has Some Nice Moments,"This movie felt a little too manufactured - whomever thought it up seemed to be reaching for every demographic, and just kept throwing in new storylines to try and grab everyone. Like it's precursorValentine's Day, it consists of several intersecting storylines, but this time centered in New York on New Year's Eve. It has an all-star cast - Halle Berry, Robert De Niro, Josh Duhamel, Zac Efron, Katherine Heigl, Ashton Kutcher, Seth Meyers, Lea Michele, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michelle Pfeiffer, Hilary Swank, Sofia Vergara. The problem is, with so many stars and storylines, no one can dig in. The result is disjointed, with just a few nice moments. For me it was OK, a solid 3- stars, but if my husband was writing this it would clearly be a 1. So, if you are really in the mood for a romantic comedy, give this a try, but set your expectations accordingly."
1,the DVD did not open at all,THis DVD did not open at all. I have not received any replies to my complaints. I am hoping someone will reply
3,Fluffy,"I suppose this movie may be good background for having friends over, when you can talk over the movie and not really feel you missed too much. You get the feeling you are people watching more than sucked into the plot or characters. I did feel like the movie is propaganda for ""experiencing your life"". Somehow it failed me, but I appreciated the effort."
5,New Year's Eve DVD,We really enjoyed it. I like Holly Berry and she didn't disappoint us. It was streamed to our TV which made it so convenient plus the price was right.
3,Movie Cute But BluRay/DVD Disc Strange,"I saw New years Eve in the theatres and thought it was cute. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. I bought the bluray/dvd and ultraviolet combo because I was going to give the dvd to a friend because she loved the movie. Well I didn't notice when I ordered it but the bluray and dvd are on one disc. One side is blu/ray and the other is the dvd. I was a little annoyed at myself for not paying attention, because I could have just gotton the single bluray version cheaper by itself. I then started thinking that hey this is a cheap way to do a combo pack, but then I started to think that this was strange. Why if you have a bluray player would you need the dvd on the other side? You would play the bluray right? By the way there is a difference in how the picture looks when you look at both sides like I did. Who does the dvd side benefit? If you have a dvd player yeah you could play it, but it would be cheaper to buy the dvd version of the movie. A lot cheaper."
3,Good movie,"It was entertaining, but its not the BEST movie ever. I'm glad i waited for it to come out on dvd to watch it."
5,Fun movie for the holidays,This DVD is a wonderful mixture of several intertwining stories which run the gambit of emotions! Not much crass language which is good for most ages. I don't recommend it for small children as they would not understand the many story lines. Have a great time with this one!
1,Stupid movie with lots of big stars that should know better.,Movie was really weak.There wasn't much substance. I found myself bored at times.The movie is not worth the time to watch it.
2,Rent Valentine's Day instead,"Each character was on the screen for such a short time that it was difficult to relate to any of them - the only exception was Robert Deniro.If you like this format, I recommend that you watch Valentine's Day instead."
1,Unwatchable,I got about 20 minutes into this movie before I had to turn it off. It is utterly painful and devoid of any value. I await the day when someone can travel back in time and prevent the existence of this abomination.
3,Funny Moments,"This film had moments of humour peppered with sappy moments and some emotional strings pulling. Great cast, almost too great because no ONE had a real moment to shine. When I saw the cast I thought the film would be a flop, but overall very entertaining and had laugh-out-loud moments."
1,Contrived and Boring,Predictable stories about people finding romance on New Years Eve. Amazing how many talented actors and actresses will stoop to perform in this totally forgetable movie. The only star that shines in this movie is New York City all decked out for the holidays.
1,Waste of time,I thought that with all the stars in this movie it would be cute but i was so wrong! The movie had no real substance. It was so boring and drawn out. None of the many stories came together well or at all clever. Don't waste your time or money. I was very disappointed.
1,New Year's Eve,I got this movie to watch with my girlfriends. We all fell asleep because it was boring. Didn't like it at all very slow.
2,Good rom com,"The movie was not the best quality (slightly pixelated), but the story was fun and entertaining. Not exactly profound and heart-wreching, but great for a rainy night in (as most romantic comedies are)."
5,LOVED IT!!,"Great Movie.. Must see! It has so many actors in it, and ones that just pop in here and there. It's a great girls nght flick, or date night movie. Who doesnt love SJP (Sarah Jessica Parker)and Michelle Pfeiffer? Add some Ashton Kutcher and Zac Efron, then no one can tear me from the sofa! Bring on the popcorn and Charleston Chews..."
4,Cute Movie,"I loved Valentines Day and when this movie came out I saw it opening night,which I usually do not do! I loved this movie too!Now what other occasion is left for Garry Marshall to do? Christmas Eve? That would be good!The actors in this movie are great and I loved how the characters are connected with each other, just like in Valentine's day.Do not listen to the nay sayers this is a movie you have to check out!"
2,"""New Year's Eve"" disappointing and boring",Doing a multi-part story is difficult - and New Year's Eve is an example of how not to do it. Stories are confusing and boring.
3,Too much...,"Too many storylines to really have any substance. It is like Valentine's Day. It has lots of big names, but not much of a story."
2,So-So,"Got as a present, it's a real chore to watch and not really my cup of tea. A mix of supposedly ""romantic"" scenarios which don't really work and are very unlikely."
5,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"I hope Roy has a new release soon. I want to hear his take on Tea Partiers..He is Extremely talented, smart and FUNNY !!!!"
1,This is digitally remumbled,I think this album is way too ethnic and there is not a word of English on it... I wil wait for their Motown album. Ricky Martin this ain't....hokie is the word !
3,Not bad...,"Although I like this type of music very much, I found these guys to be a 'total ripoff' of Hubert Von Geusen, along with other original bands."
3,They're OK,"I like the originals better. These aren't horrible- just will not order again. Live and learn :) NO bad aftertaste or anything, just not as good :)"
3,Thirty Eight minutes for full price?,"I just received the item and listened to it almost immediately. There are no qualms on the power and inspiration of Mr Haley's music, but, after all those glowing reviews, someone has to emphasize the fact that there are only 38 minutes of music on this CD. For some buyers, such as I, who ponder value, this does count.So, if you like powerful solo organ music, harmonically lush, you are in good ground. But the producers of this CD can certainly do better than offer a ""half-CD of music"" at more than the average market price: new and used.I am frustrated that, at this juncture, only one review mentions the short iming. But, more so, annoyed at myself for not having read all reviews!"
3,usual book but a little less made well than i expected to see on here i wanted a little but more int,I wished the making was better and the book itself did not look so cheap they are nice stories and I would be willing to pay a little more for a nice presented book otherwise I may have opted to get them at a dollar store
5,Perfect!,"I love this little guy, it has everything I need in a small size. Perfect! All I need is right at my fingertips."
5,strong compilation,"I have been a Bonnie Tyler fan for years. She sings both country and rock 'n' roll. The highlight of this album is ""Tyre Tracks And Broken Hearts"" This is the only Bonnie Tyler cd that includes this song."
3,Lovin' the 80's,"This WOULD have been a great CD if I had received the correct one. When I ordered this CD, it had all the songs listed as specified in the remarks section of this page as to what's on the CD. However, when I went and listened to the CD, the songs that were listed on the back of the case, were not that of the CD - it was the same line up as Super Hits: Bonnie Tyler. I still love the CD, but I was bummed to have the wrong CD packed in the CD case. Beware of imports and check your products!"
2,"Good translations, bad interpretations","This Quran is translated well, but the translator, Rashad Khalif, interprets a lot of what the Quran says in the wrong way. If you want to learn about Islam, reading his interpretations is not a good start. He will guide you in the wrong direction. The Quran is good, but be careful about what most of Rashad Khalif has to say."
2,Author (translator) overstates his own theories,"I bought this book based on reviews that said that it was an accurate translation and that you could overlook the authors ""discovery"" of a number theme in the Quran.I could not overlook the number theme when the author claimed several times in the first two chapters that the numbers proved that he (Khalifa) was the deliverer of holy messages.The translator seemed to be trying to exalt his own position rather than to translate the Quran. I lost confidence in the translation.I'm now reading a Penquin Books translation that has very few notes other than to point out when there are two possible translations of a word. It's much better."
5,written review,The product I ordered for my husband and the service by your company were very good. I was pleased with the quality of the product and your service.
4,Let's Laugh !,"As a public speaker, I value humor as a way to open people's hearts and minds. This is a fairly good resource book for that purpose. It's well organized by subject, and some of the jokes are very good."
2,"He's got the facts, what he needs is an editor.","Weisberg's ""Case Open,"" successfully picks apart and discredits Gerald Posner's ""Case Closed."" Weisberg's knowledge of the information, research, and credibility, make his book far more believable and convincing than Posner's weak attempt. Weisberg pokes holes into all of Posner's major arguments and proves the case is far from closed. However, the book is clearly a bitter expression of a feeling of neglect in Posner's book. Weisberg rants about Posner not using his work and successfully alienates the reader. While the information in Weisberg's work is interesting and more likely than Posner's to be fact, it is meant only for those who are familiar with the minute details of the JFK Assassination. If that includes you, this book is a must. For those who, like me, are simply interested in learning more about the case, there are more informative and engaging pro-conspiracy reads with more general points."
4,Good book that is marred by poor editing/ style,"Harold Weisberg is a legend in the JFK case. Just for ""Post Mortem"" alone, he deserves a hollowed place in the pantheon of this whole affair. That said, ""Case Open"" is a good book that suffers from poor editing and awkward style. If only Weisberg's book would have been presented intact (by his own admission, this was the abridged version) AND properly edited. Still, a decent assault on Posner's dreadful ""Case Closed.""vince palamara"
2,"MEDIOCRE, BUT MORE HONEST THAN CASE CLOSED","I understand why Mr. Weisberg felt compelled to write a book debunking case closed because after all, Posner's book is a sham. However, this book seems sloppy and thrown together. Not Weisbergs best effort."
1,Bitter gibberish,"This book is nothing more than a vehicle for showcasing Harold Weisberg's rantings. I credit him for revealing some of Gerald Posner's mistakes in Posner's _Case Closed_, but Weisberg himself makes several notable errors in this book. Unfortunately, Weisberg sounds too much like a raving madman for me to take his book too seriously. I know that Mr. Weisberg takes the JFK assassination seriously and that he probably feels betrayed by Posner after allowing Posner access to all his JFK files and documents, but that's no excuse to go crazy. Save your money; there are much better pro-conspiracy books out there. _Six Seconds in Dallas_ ranks at the top of my list."
1,Almost as bad as Rush to Judgment,"Weisberg makes a lot of big mistakes in his book. He seems to have this personal grudge against Posner for destroying one conspiracy theory after another. Oh well. Almost 40 years after the assassination and all I still read about is mysterious 2nd, 3rd, 4th . . . 1,232,982th . . . zillion . . . ad infinitum gunment spraying lead all over Dealey Plaza. Sheesh, I must have been the only one not involved in the conspiracy. Where did the conspirators meet, Madison Square Garden?"
3,Shumsky Out of Place,"Just came across this set here, and I must say that the Oscar Shumsky recordings of the Mozart concertos seem quite out of place, or sync with this set. Most of it is taken up with performances of the Hanover Band, a very sqwacky outfit. I love Shumsky's performances of these concertos, and both the original lp of the recording and the eventual CD, both of which I have, had a sweet picture of him on the cover looking very fondly avuncular. But his style was old style, meaning great musicianship with no gimmicks. Though Anthoy Halstead did have some good moments inexplicably with the Hanover squallers, the performances with Goodman were all very coarse. But even the good moments were nothing near the sublime Oscar Shumsky. Really out of place in this crowd."
3,Not Bad,This was made for TV and depicts a real incident on a passenger jet in the 80's. William Devane is great in this part.
4,There was a time in America CD review,This CD offers an interesting and on-target commentary on an unfortunate trend in modern society. The lyrics are heartfelt and the music is moving. A very good debut for this first time songwriter.
1,Very bad and poor,"Production and bad quality, it is a bad copy. Editing is a very bad photo shoot, and zero aesthetic quality. Not be traded as a product of such poor quality."
3,"Good overall info, but needs more attention to details on specific problems","I liked the overview on Ayurveda and natural beauty, but what I found lacking was the specific remedies for certain conditions. You will need to do further research to find these."
3,Beautiful Jewels,This is a great book for anyone who loves to bead and it was priced right. It gives you good clear directions to create beautiful light catchers or Holiday decorations. The selections are varied in 10 different designs. I love to have them hanging around the house in the windows or other locations where they will catch the light. With these direction you can create a dynamite center piece for those special get togetherss. The ideas are endless.
5,"Received ""Cool Wife"" award","This was a gift to my husband, who loves the Kill Bill movies, and also knives and swords. I did well. It got me the award of being a Cool Wife. I love that! The price is right, too. I like the sword because it can be displayed in an alcove (out of reach of children) and adds to the style of our family room. A great conversation piece. The fact that it is a real sword and it is sharp, adds to the appeal of the sword."
3,same as bride sword,"I got the Bride Sword for my son last year so I got this one for him this year. Except for the symbol etched on the blade it looks like the same exact sword. Maybe the movie swords are also the same, I don't know but it does seem redundant to get both. I do think it is a great deal for the price even with the high shipping cost which is acceptable considering the size and shape of the box. Great packaging by the way.Over all I'm satisfied but I would not have bought it if I knew it was nearly a clone of the bride sword."
4,Nice,"Heavy well built product, like the look and the inscribing of the sword, but it is dull (probably for a good reason..."
3,Decent Display Sword,This sword has good weight and balance but not really sharp. I will only be using it for practicing kata anyway so it will be perfect for that. It looks like it can take a sharpening well though I will find out when I do try it. Not a bad weapon for the money.
4,Nice product,"It's a great sword. Not at all sharp. It actually comes with a stand, but the one I bought separately is much better."
2,Just for decoration,"Just happens to be at the mall and saw this sword,was'nt worth the money they were asking for,4X as much,got to be kidding.Stainless steel (cheap) not design for (tameshigiri).guys want real katana ? save your money get a real one.Forget this under $20 junk."
3,cheap,To be honest i didnt expect this to be so fragile even for a ceremonial piece. after one swing from my observing friend something snapped inside since it is not full tang and now the blade AND handle move separately from the hilt. i guess its ok if you never pick it up. The 3rd star is for the wood display which is much sturdier and is quite nice
3,Good But a DISAPPOINTMENT.,"I Got This Sword Today, It was good it had a nice look ,good quality values to it but was misleading. This Sword was suppose to come with a leather handle but i came with a cotton materia. It had 1 to 2 dent but still good. The paint job was light weight bad but the carvings of every thing were perfect :D . The blade its self was very dull but this sword is full tang, but it is bolted .. so it kinda is. To conclude it's worth the money. Great Sword For A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE."
2,Eh.,"its not a bad sword realy but the blade wiggles in place if you move the sword around, and i realy dont like that. Also the hand wrapping came loose as soon as my hand gripped it. And another thing is, this sword isn't even a katana it is actually a tachi (witch is very similar to a katana but a katana is worn on the belt cutting edge up and a tachi is worn cutting edge down...hard to explain) i realy would not reccomend this to any body who knows much about how katanas (or even tachi's) should be. If this will be the first sword you have ever owned...or even held, then get it if you wish, but i would try getting somthing else."
5,great. just like in the stores,"but a better deal by far. meets every spec, works like the best you could buy. dont' be afraid to buy this"
3,Mixed Day,"I sometimes wonder when artists can really make great songs just have one once in awhile that fairs well, but not as good as a earlier song. Green Day has been one that has hit the mark quite well for awhile with great songs from the well-accepted American Idiot. Their latest single Holiday, the third one from the 2004 American IDiot record, is a very good driven song that fuels Green Day and their moods for good songs. Unfortunately, the song isn't as groundbreaking or heartfelt as the last single, Boulevard Of Broken Dreams was. Still, it is a good rock-driven song for any die hard Green Day fanatic.Song: C 1/2+"
2,Disappointing,It has nothing but pre-published photos we have all seen before in magazines. The tats aren't even shown. They talk about how Angelina has a lot of them but they don't even list them all. Not made for the true tattoo enthusist. A coffee table book at best. It describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats.
2,Celebrity Skin needs more to really shine,"Celebrity Skin by Jim Gerard gives the reader just what it says: skin. The collection, while titled with a body art slant, looks more like a group of celebrity photos where everyone just happens to have some body art, rather than focusing directly on it. Many of the tattoos could have been showcased more if the portraits had been posed for that purpose instead of being collected from previous publications. Written material about the celebs and their tats is of mixed length and quality. Overall, this is more like a book of celebrity tattoos for the dentist's office, and not a great addition to the tattoo library that it could have been."
3,Nice Photos,"""Celebrity Skin"" is basically a coffee table book full of photos of stars and their tattoos. It covers not just actors, but also sports icons, models and musicians. My two favorites being Bjork and Johnny Depp.The photos are really nice and ones that I haven't seen elsewhere. The info was interesting, but I guess I was hoping for more insight on to what the tattoos symbolilze to the people who got them.While I didn't dislike this book as much as some of the other reviewers, I should say that this was given to me as a gift and it's probably not a book I'd have purchased (definitely one to look at in the bookstore). I'm giving it four stars because it was fun to look through and the photos really are nice."
4,Good Collector's Item,"I bought this because I'm a huge fan of Angelina Jolie, and even though it's a little basic, I enjoyed it and it makes a great addition to any collection or a great coffee table book."
2,tom tom auto mount,"it should have the same connection as the rider mount, it is hard to put in and take out of the mount you have to put in the mount then open door then plug in. it would be much nicer if it were like the rider mount that goes on my bike with the wire connects right to the mount so all you need to do is set it in the mount and not have to put in the mount then try to open the small trap door and connect the wire."
3,"Useful, but very poorly engineered","This product is cheap and works. Meaning, it can attach to your windshield and let you connect your TomTom Rider and use it in a car, for those days when you don't feel like taking the Harley out.However, it also has some serious design flaws. The major one is how it connects to power. Instead of using the Rider's external weather-proof connectors, it forces you to stick the cable through the lower hole, open the little hatch, and connect. Very awkward, particularly if you don't have a tall car with a tall windshield. The minor (yet annoying) flow is the way you are supposed to remove it from the glass: a short plastic strip that, in theory, will release the vacuum when pulled. In practice, it works rarely, forcing you to struggle with the mount until... when, until you break it.Useful, but had they just copied the Rider's motorcycle mount instead of inventing a new, poorer design, it would have been 5 stars."
5,Perfect Follow up to their Last Book!,"I just wanted to say that this is a perfect Follow Up to their last book. In my review of their other book, I mentioned that FEAR was slowing me down. Even though they gave an easy to follow game plan in that book, the fear was still there. I could follow it, and take my mind off of the fear, pretending that it wasn't there, but the moment it had a chance, it started trying to get to me.This book, it has helped me learn more about myself. It gave me questions that when answered honestly, showed me that nothing was in my way but me.Check it out. I am sure you won't be disappointed."
4,Good read!,"Although most of the wealth-creating principles are not new, this book is well written and can still serve as a great resource for aspiring millionaires. Mike and Roger's style is very entertaining. I recommend it without hesitation."
1,Worst Way to Learn a Language!,"We were required to purchase this waste of paper for my Persian I course. The problem with it is that it is written linguistically. It is not meant for someone to crack it open, read and learn in a self-study fashion. In fact, it has been useless in class as well. Our teacher insists we refer to it, but everyone gets blank stares when he says that because we know it won't help."
3,Forbidding for the beginner.,"If you don't have any prior exposure to Farsi, this is not the textbook for you, unless you happen to be admirably perseverant. I would recommend instead ""Colloquial Persian: The Complete Course for Beginners"" by Abdi Rafiee. Although geared more toward conversational Persian, that book is structured and written in a more lucid style, while still managing to be quite thorough. It contains a key to the exercises and a tape to aid with pronunciation, neither of which are included with Thackston's book."
3,persian review,This book is helpful however it is weak on verbs in that it does not show verbs linked to pronouns and is printed in an archaic format
3,Could have been better.,"There are lots of pictures and detailed information about human anatomy more than needed in the book. Authors should have given balanced importance to the programmes and execises. It is a good book, or should I say it is not just a waste of time.."
2,NOT for the beginner,"I'm an avid reader of Men's Health but this book is by no means for the ""average guy."" This book is filled with lots of great tips for those who want to be professional weight lifters but I would never recommend this to a beginner. A workout book should inspire you...this book was so complicated and intimidating I was discouraged before even hitting the gym."
3,Not detailed,"Book has some nice illutrations and hints but not really that detailed for a new starter it a good read but not a refernce book for refering to, use arnold's book instead"
3,Decent,"Overall I found this book to be average. I personally did not experience much strength gain in the 4 months I used their workout designs. I have had much more success in simply making up my own routines. They do have some good variations on certain things though, I have stolen a few and used them like the squat w/ closer foot positioning. My biggest problem is that in the early stages you are forced to do some pretty stupid looking exercises and if other people are around you feel like a tool. After awhile you get away from that though but be warned, you will do do some things that make you look like you've never been in a gym before."
2,Makes things too complicated,"I bought this book back in 2005 and made progress, but lets be serious...I was an untrained n00b, anything would have given me progress. The book takes the matter seriously, but truth is, it over-complicates training; but who could blame them, no way you can keep selling monthly issues of a magazine unless you follow as a philosophy to over-complicate training regimen and dress up the same lame exercises into different variations.In reality, all you really NEED is the main exercises, the compound ones, like squat, deadlift, press, bench press, clean, and anything else that assist those exercises like rows, pull-ups, dips, etc.And I have NOT found a book to teach you this fundamental exercises and to guide you towards doing some real work, better than 'Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training by Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore'.Get it and learn the fundamentals, after that you can do whatever you want, but at least get your foundation in order."
4,One of best,This is one of the best books on lifting. It gives you the basics and training schedules for the beginner to intermediate to the advanced.I recommend it with Delavier's Strength Training Anatomy as a companion book to this one. Together you get a five star book.
5,Right to the Point,"An easy read, right to the point, and down-right honest. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to start a weight training regimen. A very easy read. One thing I hate about work out books is reading them, but this one was so easy to follow that I just kept reading. Everything in it makes a lot of sense. The workouts require a lot of time."
3,Good book,My very first book on lifting weights I ever bought. This book helped me a lot and I learnt a great deal from this book. This book is a great book for anyone looking for a great read and new ideas in the weight room.
4,Very Good,"This book is extremely detailed and very good in it's knowledge and breathe of training. My only complaint is that in the back of the book they give you workouts to do. They list all the exercises with the names and a small picture of the movement. What they don't do is reference the exercise to what page in the book. Most of these movements are new to me, so I had to keep going to the index and finding the exercise to review how to do it. No big deal, but it would make the book perfect."
3,Informative but basic,"I think you can find a lot of the info in this book online, but it was still an interesting read."
5,Nice and Educational,"Book includes a lot of information about muscle, and a lot of technical language which is good because when I read it with my younger brother it pushes him to use a dictionary. Exercises are well explained and good time is made to ensuring no injuries occur."
4,My muscles ACTUALLY grew from reading it.,JK but yeah very helpful in understanding the important basics and biology of what I do every day. I got my money's worth.
4,Good Help For Variety,"This book can really give you some ideas of how to incorporate many different lifting stations to help keep variety in the workouts. That is sometimes the biggest thing to getting into a rut and bored with working out. The overview of diet is helpful also. I do think the sample workout are a bit complicated. I try to keep things very simple even for more advanced lifters by altering workout order, doing combination reps, super sets, compound sets, etc. I really didn't see much mention on proper supplementation which I believe is a must for peak performance.[[...]]"
4,Best book for weight training,If you have to get a book for weight training this is the one. I am a big fan and recomend it to all my students who want to add some knowledge to their workout routing.
2,Unrealistic for most people,"This book has lots of pretty pictures and info, but if you are looking for a workout plan, look somewhere else. The ""beginner"" workouts take at least 2 hours to complete. This is not realistic for most people."
3,Not for the serious body builder,"The concepts in this book are very interesting and if a person wants to have an excellently toned body, this would be the book for them. However, the emphasis is not on serious high intensity workouts for the person wanting major gains in size."
5,weightlifting bible,this is a must have for anyone who lifts weights. It helps you understand whats really going on with each muscle as you perform any lift. Also has awesome training guides and nutritional facts. Lots of pictures that will allow you to execute proper form which is lacking in many many gyms.
4,"Very High Quality Materials, Pretty Good content","This book is so nicely put together that it almost belongs on the coffee table: the quality of the binding and paper is superb; the illustrations and photographs are beautiful. If I didn't know any better, this would look almost like an art book. The content is top notch. My only complaint is that workout programs at the end of the book should have included the page numbers to the corresponding exercises. It gets tiresome flipping back and forth to find the exercises that go with each program. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Very pretty but basic book,This book is a great basic book that covers it in a very attractive package. If you're a bit past that then then book will start to be less useful as you gain knowledge. Good for someone with less than a year's experience in the gym.
5,Good book,Great book worth buying . Lots of helpful info for all stages of people trying to get fit.
1,BOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this book really bored me out. For starters, the REAL action only occured at the last 1/4 of the book. The rest of the book circles on how to solve the problem, the mystery behind the plot and what the sisters have learnt. And please, Prue only dated Andy, they NEVER got engaged, and Wyatt merely looking at his mother nonchalantly when Piper was in danger? The Wyatt that is portrayed in this book is certainly not the Wyatt in the tv series, as he would NEVER let anything plague his mom.To charmed readers: maybe its just me, but I can assure you, there is very little action and magic done, and its not worth it."
2,Painted A Wrong Picture!,"Picture Perfect is an utter bore. For one, I liked the snappy patter and witty dialogue written up in the book. Then I backtracked, and realised this is a book, and NOT a television show. Snappy lines and good interaction only help on-screen. Off screen, this book is rather boring, and the action at P3, in the last part of the book, was hardly enough to satisfy ANY reader. Cameron Dokey is one who likes to explore interpersonal relationships between the characters, but she must be reminded once again that this is Charmed, not The West Wing."
1,"Elementary, Watson... the stories need to be legible","WIth the possible exception of the Compact Oxford English Dictionary (which at least comes with its own magnifying glass), I've never found a book impossible to read -- until now. The Wordsworth edition shrinks down (WAY down) what appear to be the original pages as printed in Strand magazine. Yes, it has an aura of 19th century authenticity to it, but with even with good reading glasses on and a good night light, I could barely make out the words. After struggling with one page for five minutes, I threw the book away."
2,Case Book of Sherlock Holmes,Buyer beware!! This audio contains only 4 or the original 13 stories contained in the Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. Clearly it is an abridgement. !!
1,Font is too small,This review does not refer to the stories themselves but the edition. The font size on the Wordsworth edition is about 2. This is not what Amazon advertises with its 'look inside' feature. This is a small facsimile of the Strand version with a darker copy of the famous Paget illustrations. I was hoping for something easy to read with illustrations and this is not it.
3,The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes read by Derek Jacobi,"Being read by Derek Jacobi,of course it's good, but it's very annoying having half a story on one disc and having to change discs to hear the end. As I listen to the discs in bed, I find it a great disadvantage. It's put me off buying other similar products."
1,Martin's Poor Scholarship,"Walter Martin was a poor scholar. There are many books attacking Jehovah's Witnesses that stick to the facts. However, Martin's does not. He attacked the Watchtower's use or misuse of Greek, but it is obvious that he had no knowledge of the language himself. Unfortunately, Martin's works keep being sold because they satisfy the psychological needs of many people in the evangelical-fundamentalist world with regard to Jehovah's Witnesses. But such persons are no more objective than was he nor are Jehovah's Witnesses."
5,A great everyday wine glass,We bought these glasses for my Son & Daughter-in-Law for Xmas. They have wine with dinner every night and these were perfect for them. They look a lot more expensive than the actual cost and have a wonderful feel to them.
3,other format?,HI - I would buy this but not in NTSC! i am in Mexico and like most of the world it is PAL - is there another way?thanks
1,Gift that didn't work out,"My husband loves history and loves Chicago. We saw a play on the Chicago Fire so I thought this would make a great gift. In a word, no.He felt it was poorly written and boring."
3,Handy plant guide,"I like this guide but the only drawback is that you have to know the botanical name for the plant. Handy size, nice pictures but you have to know what you're looking for when searching."
3,The world is a ....,"I heard this album so long ago, but what I remember of it is the peacefull and armonious of the brazilian music."
1,Beware,"While the above cover is of the import version of the Hoyt Axton album Lonesome Road, the song titles and snippets are for the domestic release. A total of five tracks are shared between the two releases, however, the import is comprised solely of mid to up-tempo rockabilly compositions. Please check with the vendor before ordering to insure you are ordering the correct version."
1,Bait & Switch,Was looking for a Captain Kangaroo video to show my granddaughter and got this instead. It had nothing to do with Captain Kangaroo. I tried to get a refund and never heard back from them. Money wasted.
5,dragon's blood,i really liked it i kept on getting mixed up becaus i thought it was on earth it kept me reading and annoyed my bros
5,good book,This is the best book in the trilogy. Most Dragon books are full of magic and stuff. Most people expect that.I was surprised to find a more reallistic book about dragons that actually worked. Its a wonderfull story about growing up and reaching dreams and proving youself. I would defanately reccommend it. Do read the rest of the trilogy but be prepared - like most books - sequals hardly ever match up to the origanal.
3,Good . . . somewhat.,"This book is a good dragon book, but doesn't fit very well in the fantasy category. While the story moves at a great tempo, I got lost, and bored in places. It would be nice to have a sequal to, but there's not much more good about it"
4,Could be 3 stars,"This book was only okay for every bad thing there was luck to follow. i have not read the second bok but i hope the end is better than this one... i wouldn't be surprised if its name was I will fill my bag myself or FEWMETS!! or something like that but there was just the right amount of detail there wasn't too much making the book 1,000 pages long and there wasnt too little making the book 3 pages long..."
4,Dragon's Blood,"It's a pretty good book, very detailed and gives the reader a pretty good idea on how life is with dragons. Among all the dragon related stories I've read, this one is by far the best. Although I think that children younger than ten or eleven will have some trouble understanding the climax and plot of the story."
5,Best of the trilogy,"I read this book a very long time ago, a book I borrowed from the library. I thought it great; dragons have always been a beloved topic of mine. If you like dragons, this is definitely the book for you. I liked it so much I bought the whole trilogy because of it, but 'Dragon's Blood' is the best in my opinion. The sequals weren't as good as I hoped, but not bad. The other thing was that I liked the original covers better, which you can probably still see in most libraries, but not in bookstores today."
4,Breaking the age barrier,"Although this book is recommended for younger readers, I recommend it for anyone who likes good stories with a tiny touch of Sci-Fi / Fantasy! The other books in the trilogy are wonderful as well, it's sad that the story ever ended."
2,cute,Cute and uplifting a fun read but light on any real help.You cant help admire the author but the story would have made a better long article .Real advice is somewhat lacking
5,motivating and fun read!,"I'm not quite new to the athletic world... still, I found Slow Fat Triathlete impossible to put down. In a very unusual twist for books like these, it is wildly entertaining with its conversational style and humorous slant.When you finish this, you'll feel like you can take on the world-- and certainly, the triathlon."
3,"Nice and personal, but...","I read this book because, like the author, I too am a larger ""Athena"" triathlete. I have completed 12 sprint-distance triathlons and wasn't really looking for any sound advice about how to train, eat, sleep, etc. I feel this would make a better human interest article and not necessarily a book. However, I would definitely recommend this to a tri newbie who happens to be fit and fat...or anyone else fearing to try tris."
3,Very entertaining but not as informative as you would like,"I thought the book was well written, very entertaining to read and even inspirational. However I felt it lacked on what I needed actually do. There was very little on drills or techniques. I did enjoy reading the whole book and did visit almost every website she mentioned in the back of her book. I thought her stories and race reports were insightful but I guess I was looking for a bit more on what I needed to do to get started. I am 6'3, 220 lbs so I am not a small person and was looking for more guidance on how to start out. But she is a great writer, and she does inspire."
3,"Long on motivation, short on technique","I picked up this book because the title really spoke to me. Having recently lost a significant amount of weight, I wanted to prove to the world how much more active I was by signing up for a triathlon. Realizing now that this is insane, I'm looking for help wherever I can find it. I was really hoping that this book would help me with some of the technique, since I'm still slow, fat, and lazy on the inside. I don't have good running or swimming techniques, and probably could use some pointers on cycling as well. Not much there in Slow Fat Triathlete. While this book was very amusing and fun to read, I don't feel any more prepared for my triathlon after I finished it than I did before I read it. It is more of a ""Your Triathlon FAQs Answered!"" than anything technical."
5,Loved It!!,I am proud to call myself a Slow Fat Triathlete. Jayne really captures the humor that can be found in this sport if you don't take yourself too seriously.
4,sincere motivation for the beginner,"This is a very funny, and truthful account from a woman who is going through the lumps that so many experience while breaking into triathlon. She perserveres where many fail, and inspires with a ""train through the pain while smiling"" attitude."
4,SFT,"really enjoyed it. although somewhat dated it is very readable,funny and above all motivational. the author is right, pretty much anybody can do a tri - at least the sprint version. i plan to do my first 14oct."
4,Great!,"I really loved this book. The author's sense of humor about the whole situation really helped me get over my tri fears. It was absolutely the right book for me. It gave a great overview of her journey and the things that happen along the way that really can be tragic or hilarious depending on your outlook and hindsight. She didn't get preachy about workouts but gave some great general ideas. (I'm one of those who starts to get rebelious when I see things like 'you must run 10 miles on Tuesday at 2PM.) Instead she talked realistically about how you fit in your workouts with your real life and I've found an amazing amount of time to get my workouts in that I didn't know existed! I'm doing my first tri in a little over 2 weeks from now - I wore my tri suit to the pool to train this week and didn't give it a second thought as I walked through the pool area. I love the water, I love the bike, and someday the treadmill may even register my feeble effort as a run instead of a jog. :)"
2,"Ok, not great","If all you want to know is about design, this is the book for you. Other then that it is useless. No information on practical set up of lighting plots. The Shelly book is much better."
2,Could be better,"This book , I beleive is the sixth edition, and it is out of date to todays highly intelligent systems. ""Stage lighting handbook"" is good for those who just started theatre stage work, but it does not apply to rock concert settings. It is well written, very basic style of writing, does not touch on the technical side of using DMX consoles or applications."
2,Outdated,"Book was published in 2001, so a lot of the information is kind of outdated. Still good for getting a general grasp of THEATER-oriented lighting basics, although North Americans be warned as the writer is from the UK, and thus uses the UK terms for the various lighting fixtures and methods. We really should set a standard on this sort of thing--but then again, this is lighting we're talking about. If we can't decide what kind of plug to use on a fixture, how are we supposed to come up with a standardized name?"
5,The Lighting Bible,"I am doing the lights for concerts here in Japan and only because the boss asked me to. I hadno idea what I was doing, but this manual inline with on the job training really enlightened me(cliche)I totally recommend this book to newbies who really want to put out a good light show."
3,101 material and outdated technology info,This book would be a great tool for someone just getting started in theatrical stage lighting. It is well written and contains a vast amount of basic knowledge. I would not recommend this to currently working lighting designers as it is really outdated compared with technology that is used today.
4,"Don't miss the ""vacuum cleaner incident."" LOL","The newer episode with Tom Bergeron is better than the other two older ones with Bob Sagat - who I think is a freakin idiot, by the way. As soon as you get a few good laughs from a handful of videos, Bob's embarrasingly awful humor gets you all ticked off again. I recommend hitting the mute button when Bob is on the screen - you'll enjoy the videos a lot more.By the way, Tom Bergeron rules. He has made AFV the best it has ever been."
3,It's Alright,"These are okay, some are very funny but most are cut too short, not funny or ones that you've already seen. The kids will like it, though."
5,Purchase-worthy Book!,"I just reviewed a ""door"" book and had it mixed up with this one although the former review isn't totally inaccurate. This book has beautiful pictures and lots of information on all kinds of doors including the country and culture of origin. It's also a great history book. Well worth the purchase."
5,Totally charming stuff,"I'm so happy to see this album come back into print, because I've recommended it to many people over the years, but it has rarely been available.This is a recording of a live operetta concert. It's not stuff you're probably familiar with, except the ""Merry Widow"" excerpts, and of course it's not the deepest music you'll ever hear, but it's really great fun.Gruberova, often accused of having strange vocal affectations and a rather cold voice, is remarkably effective in this venue. First of all, the same scooping and emphasis that you might find annoying in Lucia is all fun and enjoyable here. And of course she has the Vienese idiom down beautifully.There are some absolute gems on the album, my favorite being the second cut (a Strauss waltz). Listen to that excerpt on the site, and you'll know immediately whether you'll like the whole recording."
4,"Interesting Subject, Pedestrian Documentary","I would have hoped for a more emotionally moving and interesting documentary but appreciate a documentary was made. I want to learn more about the Congo, Belgium and King Leopold II and think I might find some more interesting materials. This film was a good start. It is just too much like a British version of Dateline NBC or 20/20. The style the documentary was created in is similar to Kurt and Cortney if you have seen that movie."
2,A so good reportage with many avoidable mistakes,"This movie is excellent even if not a surprise after reading ""the ghost"" bookSadly, many production details are jeoparding it:1. Mistakes in subtitles: 150 in French is subtitle 500, 16hours (4pm) subtitle 6pm.2. The persons interviewed are unknown: we do not know their name, job, functions3. The letters are sometimes read, sometimes declamed but we never know if it is fiction or reality: the reference of the letter (who, to who, when) in subtitleWithout all this, I would have rated the movie 4 stars but opening a book about history without giving your sources is unprofessional."
1,Price tag is way too high,You can buy every game in this bundle for about $20 a piece making buying the whole bundle seperately cost $100. Lower the price to maybe $90 and there's a slight chance that someone may actually buy it.
3,very good show.........but what about the episodes missing?,This is a fave show to watch...love the way it was presentented ....the only question I have is there are some episodes not available......there was one episode that Ive been trying to find because it hit home...Ive looked everywhere but cant seem to find.......The DNA Link/Secret Slide...I remember checking out A & E for the releases but nothing...Any idea why?
1,What about the missing episodes?,"Some episodes are missing. So why should one even bother to buy this? Why are these episodes missing? Are they going to be provided in the near future, or this is it? Isn't this like buying a bicycle with a missing wheel?"
4,Of interest to would-be specialists,"This book should be of interest to people who are interested in becoming specialist growers, and especially breeders, particularly if they are interested in one of the few plant types covered: Hostas, Daylilies, Roses, Antique Fruit Trees, Herbal Arts, Dwarf Conifers, Peonies, Wildflowers (of the Southeastern woods), Lilies, Peppers. One does learn what sort of dedication it takes to be such a specialist, and the pros and cons of various plants, but there are better sources for info on each type of plant.There is beginning info on propagation of most of these plant types, and on setting up the landscape and work areas for growing and propagating them. It is not especially helpful for general horticulturists looking for tips on various types of plants. Perhaps ""The Well-Tended Perennial Garden"" is the best resource for most such gardeners, and/or whichever book best covers a given genus or other category (there are books exclusively on most of these plant types)."
4,Quality product at a very good price,"500 Mount Bulk PackI had hundreds of slides that a family member had taken in the 50s... all mounted in rugged Leica aluminum mounts with ""protective"" glass over the film. No commercial service would scan them in this type mount so I undertook remounting all of them. This PAKO (I'm not sure why the graphic is ""PAKON"" as the mount says PAKO) mount is really your only option, nevertheless it's a good one: Inexpensive, quite clever in design and easy to use. Patience is a requirement in a job like this but in the end seeing some 60 yr. old Kodachrome images was well worth it! These are relatively hard to find at retail but you really can't beat this 500 quantity price. The one place I found locally wanted almost $15/100 mounts."
5,enjoyable gem from a first-rate composer,"Compared to his famous symphonies and symphony poems, Arnold Bax's works in this collection are much less known. However, an unintentional contact with them is enough to hook you up. Presented in this CD are some romantic pieces from a modern-time composer. Unlike some strange works produced in 20th century, they are all beautifully written and easily accessible. Among them ""Valse"" is pretty remarkable. Boasted as the premier recording ever in the world, this small piece displays some interesting harmonies and manifests the charming skills of the composer. Other works in this selection are no less appreciable. Try it and I bet you will give them the recognition and applause they deserve."
2,What???? These are NOT Darcy's daughters!,"I pulled this book off the library shelf because the author's name is so close to Austen. I was a bit skeptical because I knew she could never measure up, but this was even worse than I expected.Darcy and Elizabeth would have never raised their kids to have such a lack of propriety. We all know how proper Darcy was and Elizabeth was so disgusted by her younger sisters, at times, she never would have raised clones.Also, Jane Austen never wrote anything sexual in her books and there was plenty of it in this one, not harlequin romance sexual, but sexual all the same. It just doesn't ring true for a period piece like this one.If you are a true Jane Austen fan, you won't enjoy this book; it just bothers the soul!"
3,History repeats in this sequel of P&P,"It's been 20 years since Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy married for love. Darcy and Elizabeth have gone to Constantanople on a diplomatic mission and their 5 oldest daughteres are staying with Darcy's cousin, Fitzwilliam and his wife.The five Darcy girls are a mixed bag (clones of Mary/Jane, 2 clones of Lydia, 1 of Elizabeth, 1 non-clone more like Elizabeth than anyone else). All five are headstrong and opinionated and not at all to the liking of Fitzwilliam who finds them too out-spoken for their own good while not lacking in looks or manners.With a residence in London, loose control and the season just starting the temptations are too much for Georgina and Belle who are empty-headed and in love with the thought of lovers and drama. It's Lydia all over again (and she has a small part in this book).There are lots of secondary plots and the usual comedy of manners. It's a well paced and written tribute to the original book and a resonable sequel."
2,Didn't much care for it....,"By the time I reached the middle of the book, I still didn't really care about the characters. I love Jane Austen, and this really is nothing like her writing. When the story starts, you think Leticia and Camilla, the two oldest, will be sort of a ""Jane and Lizzy"" team, but you get the feeling the author didn't really know what to do with Leticia, and she keeps becoming more and more unsympathetic, and is really never redeemed as a character. The book has none of the relational tension that makes the Austen books so good. Virtually all the characters are one dimensional, only Camilla is given any sort of decent treatment.I hope there is no sequel ......"
3,"Hello, Editor?","This novel was a fun bit of fluff - a beach book for us Austenites. I chose to simply roll my eyes at the blatant plot plagerism going on (I mean, really, how many elopments can one family have - poor Mr Gardiner! And FIVE daughters, all of whom are silly except the heroine - poor Mr Bennet!). Hard to take it too seriously. But one part really bothers me: this story supposedly takes place 20 years after the story in Pride + Prejudice, yet it is the year 1818. P+P was published in 1813!"
4,Good and bad,"As a huge P&P fan, I really enjoyed this book, but I didn't find Aston entirely true to the characters. I thought the characters she invented were realistic, but she had a hard time maintaining the ones she inherited from Austen. For instance, Aston's portrayals of the Fitzwilliams and the Gardiners didn't seem to quite match the characters in P&P. Also, I was disappointed at the almost total omission of some of the characters - Jane, Kitty, and Mary, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, and especially Elizabeth and Darcy! I think Jane Austen fans will have fun reading this book, but will be able to pick out some flaws."
4,Nice Sequel,"I found the book very enjoyable, very believable within the world of Pride and Prejudice. I could definitly see some of the characteristics of Miss Austen's original characters in Mr. Darcy's Daughters. Camilla is most certainly her mother's daughter and Belle has shades of her Aunt Lydia. I also enjoyed seeing more of the minor characters from P&P;, Mr and Mrs. Gardiner, Lydia Bennet, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Caroline Bingley, etc.I found it strange that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, who I believe in the original is the sister and brother in law of Mrs. Bennet, should have a daughter the same age as the Darcy sisters. Oh well, such is the nature of sequels not written by the original author. I would have also liked to see Darcy and Lizzie come back at the end, but oh well.It was a good read, very enjoyable, especially for those of us who are P&P; fans."
1,too close to a trashy romance novel,"Yes, trashy romance has its place and time--but not when the author is attempting a sequel to Jane Austen's writings! Very contrived mishaps and concerns. Language was forced, and didn't seem of correct period. Just not a fun read. Basicly an extremely bad rewrite of the original Pride and Prejudice, with its intended readers being the sort who might enjoy watching Jerry Springer."
1,Highly disappointing,"If you are a fan of Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, and Mr. Darcy in particular, do not buy Mr. Darcy's Daughters. I had to force myself to finish the book, even while trying to keep an open mind and not expect it to be of the same caliber of Pride and Prejudice. The story is weak, the characters forgettable. If I'd read the reviews here first I wouldn't have bothered with the book. There were many extraneous characters in the novel, love interests develop late and with little or nothing to support them. There are more references to sex than I think is in line with a sequel to a Jane Austen novel. I also found it strange that any children of Mr. Darcy (let alone five of them) would choose to show little regard for how their behavior affected their standing in good London society. At least Mr. and Mrs. Darcy are out of the country for the duration of the novel and are spared the humiliation of making an appearance in such a second-rate piece of work."
2,A pleasant attempt,"""Mr. Darcy's Daughters"" is a pleasant ATTEMPT in trying to continue one of the best pieces of literature of all time (Pride & Prejudice). Main word: attempt. Aston fails to provide me with a worthwhile look into the future of Mr. Darcy's offspring. Why did she have to make all of the characters so unlikable? I found myself not even caring for Camilla and Mr. Wytton. I didn't even like where she took the story. I give Aston points for her writing and informative details of London...and that's about it."
1,Embarrassing. Mediocre.,"Just no. No. Don't read this. I picked it up in the middle of summer. It was on the table with all the other summer-read books. I fell prey to the title and to my weakness for Jane Austen.This is no more than a Harlequin/Gothic paperback romance. Stilted, affected prose, shallow situations, obviously drawn characters, no insight, nothing interesting at all. Just awful.By the way, Col. Fitzwilliam is supposed to be this shallow, harsh, ridiculous man...Mr. Fitzwilliam? Did the author even READ Pride & Prejudice?"
2,good consept but disappointing.,"When I saw this book the title made me think that Mr Darcy had been afflicted similiarly to the poor Mr. Bennett. A family of daughters and no sons. Not so, as I found. But it would have been more fun.Actually the book is disappointing in all aspects. The author did not try to recreate the dialogue between Elizabeth and Darcy, sending them overseas, but she did tackle Darcys' cousin Fitzwilliam. This energetic character from P % P she turned into a prejudiced, rule bound, critical and unsympathetic grouch. Caroline Bigley, now married, no more than a gossip- no strenght to her. And worst, is Lydia's transformation from the unlucky ... to the wife of a friend of the Prince of England and hostest of the greatest parties (routs) of the London season.NO. This is not amusing or entertaining. I won't give away the punch line of the scandal that is the denoument,(and how they are rescued) but it is far and away the most unrealistic contrivance that I have ever seen."
2,Disappointing,"I found it very hard to believe these were Fitzwilliam and Elizabeth Darcy's daughters. The storyline is entertaining, but I could not help but be disappointed that someone would come up with a story of them leaving their five daughters in London for over a year without their supervision. After all that Elizabeth went through with her own family and Darcy with his own sister, it's just unrealistic."
1,Very Disappointing...,"I am in love with Jane Austen, so I saw this book and eagerly picked it up. I didn't expect it to be on par with the original P&P;, but just silly fun. It doesn't even amount up to that.My main problem with this book is that it betrays the number on rule of writing: show, don't tell. Austen never said directly who her characters were, she let the dialoge and actions speak. This author tells us directly who each person is, and its quite annoying and shallow.The second problem is that all of the orginal characters lose much in the retelling. Mr. Fitzwilliam was a kind, sensitive gentlemen, now he's fussy. Caroline Bingley is reduced to a petty gossiper. The Gardiners become wealthy and on the top of society. Britain was not at the forefront of social mobility at this time, and its just stupid to have this done.Aston is neither witty, engaging or revealing. The characters are weak, silly and confusing.Avoid this like the plague. Spare yourself and go reread Austen."
2,Good beach book,"I am an Austen fan and loved P&P so was thrilled to see this book. I bought it without reading a single review. I just finished the book and have to say it reads more like a modern day romance novel. If you don't get your hopes up for quality writing it's a decent little book and a quick read. By the end of the story, however, you're not wishing the book would never end and that you would love to hear about the future of the characters. You're simply satisfied that it's ended. The book feels overly drawn out and the characters become somewhat annoying."
2,Just plain silly,"PRIDE & PREJUDICE probably is the novel that created romance novels. As such, it was a curious book for a spinster in the English countryside to have written in the earliest years of the 19th century.Yet its author, Jane Austen, must have been an astute observer, because no book reveals the manners of its characters, and the rhythms of their lifestyle, more effectively.She penned a perfect story of romantic attraction and sexual tension and resolution; why that story seems so perfect cannot be quantified, but it unquestionably is the reason that ""P & P"" has remained a classic for two centuries.In comparison, MR. DARCY'S DAUGHTERS, a modern day ""sequel"" to ""P & P"" written almost 200 years later, just seems silly. A voice such as Miss Austen's, a voice that then was fresh and insightful, merely seems predictable and stilted and derivative when parodied here by the author of DAUGHTERS.Jane Austen no longer is around to defend herself and, really, she deserves better."
4,Glad to own it!,"I must admit I was skeptical about the story because it's not really anything about Darcy and Elizabeth Darcy. In truth, these daughter's could belong to any rich couple of the period. I actually found it difficult to believe that the Darcy's would be so careless with their children. But, it was a satiisfying read -- so much so that I find myself buying all of Aston's books. The best one I've read of hers is The Second Mrs. Darcy. However, this one, Mr. Darcy's Daughters, is a very satisfying read that I'm glad to own."
2,Lacking Originality,"After finishing Pride and Prejudice, I was looking for another book and happened upon Mr. Darcy's Daughters, however the book was a disappointment. The daughters' characters were repetitions of the Bennet sisters also, the plot was very similar to the original and lacking any suspense since the fate of all the characters was easily discernable early on in the novel. The attitude and actions of the characters are also extremely overdone and lacking plausibility."
3,Another Austen Re-Make Dissappointment,"Everytime I buy a sequel that was not written by the author of the orignal I swear that I will never do it again. Needless to a say when I started reading this book my expectations were low, but it did succeced in surpassing them ( which honestly does not say much).While it is missing some key elements that any die-hard Austen fan will expect (just one appearence from Mrs. and Mr. Darcy would have been nice) it does succeced in creating a story of its own within the sphere of Austen's world.This book nowhere compares to the orignal but in a realm of glossless remakes it definatly holds its own."
2,I really wanted to like it,"The thing with this book is I really wanted to like and there were moments of brillance but they are few and far between. I had to go back and re-read parts of Pride and Prejudice to ensure that the author really had butchered Mr. Fitzwilliam, who in the original is a great understanding and not judgmental character and the Gardiners.The only character I truly liked was Aletha, the youngest daughter but she barely does anything! The author jumps from character to character, sometimes requiring you to go back to figure out who is still talking. Nothing more irritating in a book. So as much as the idea of the book is but follow through lacks. Aletha is the only decent character and unfortunately, I doubt we will see her again."
3,Entertaining but lacks originality,"I found ""Mr Darcy's Daughters"" entertaining. I enjoyed reading the book and couldn't put it down. However, during the course of reading the book, I coldn't help but (a) wonder if Darcy and Elizabeth would produce such narrowminded, prudish, and/or immature daughters (I had far greater expectations than that) and (b)compare this novel to Pride and Prejudice. I felt that each of Darcy's 5 daughters, apart from Letty, mirorored the characters of the Bennett sisters, in that sense I thought the story lacked originality.I would recommend this book if you are a fan of the period or social scene for that time, but not if you are a strong critic craving for a Jane Austen caliber novel."
3,It Would Make A Lovely Movie,"After finishing this novel, I truely believe it would make a better movie. I would love to see the BBC take it on. It was very hard to keep track of all of the girls' suitors, but had I been able to see their faces, I believe I would have been able to follow the story a little bit better, and been more sucked into what was going. Aston did a nice job, and there are some very fun twists towards the end. I enjoyed the character of Alethea, and look forward to reading more about her in the sequal."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This book is well written. The main characters are well-rounded and interesting. Many of the side characters are a little flat when it seems as though the author intended them to be round.I am a big fan of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice."" I picked this book up knowing it would never be Austen's book, but hoping for a little fun with the lives of Aston's Darcy daughters.The parents of these young ladies play no role in this novel, which was a bit of a disappointment. Even though it wouldn't have been Jane Austen's words, it would have been nice to see Mr. Darcy and his beloved Elizabeth again.The book is entertaining and well written. Aston could have achieved the same ends, however, by using characters unrelated to Austen's masterpiece."
2,Stick with the original,"As a big Jane Austen fan, I was thrilled to see this book. However, while the author manages to catch the tone of Austen's style, especially in dialogue, it seems that her goal was to show the seamy side of Regency life. As one of Austen's characters might say, ""It don't suit."" Austen's genius lies in her subtlety, where she shows that life was not as prim and proper as society would have it without being blatant about it. Aston shows none of Austen's humor. Readers wanting a taste of the forbidden in this period would be better off reading Austen's own ""Mansfield Park."""
1,Aston hates Austen??,"After reading this book, all I can say is that Elizabeth Aston clearly has no love for any of the characters in Pride and Prejudice. Col. Fitzwilliam is a lecherous dolt, Elizabeth is self-involved and careless of her daughters, and the rest of the original characters are given short shrift. As for the plot, Aston has taken the original five Darcy girls and turned them into inadequate and inane replicas of the Bennet sisters, complete with all the stereotypes each Bennet girl represented. The only difference is that Aston seems to amplify their faults while glossing over their finer qualities. Overall, I wish I had never read this horrible sacrilege."
3,"No Jane Austen, but entertaining.","Has a hint of Jane Austen flair, but is not in the same league. It is the closest we have... That being said, I found the characters not all that likeable. In my imagination, Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth would never had children that behaved like this. In the original, I believe Elizabeth's younger sisters acted as they did because they were allowed to run wild & had no disipline. Neither Darcy nor Elzabeth were that way. I can not imagine them raising their children any different.If you go into this knowing it is not what Jane Austen would have written, but are looking for a romance that is not a ""Fabio type"" romance, this book is enjoyable."
2,Disappointing read,"Jane Austen's books are addicting and I was excited to find a plethora of books available that carry on where she left off. This book was the first Jane Austen sequel I read. I found it disappointing that Elizabeth & Mr. Darcy were not in the book, but only mentioned in passing. I found their daughters to be cardboard (maybe there were too many characters in the story?) and I feel their characters could have been developed further. Also, [spoiler alert] I felt that some of the suspense towards the end of the book (one of the twins disappearing & leaving a note that she had married, but then finding out it was only a ""joke"") felt really contrived. When I first found this series, I was excited that the story would be told throughout a number of books, but after reading this one, I've decided to not persue the rest."
1,Mr. Darcy's Daughters -- NOT,"It is difficult to believe Ms. Aston has read Pride and Prejudice for the simple reason that none of the ""daughters"" presented in this book could possibly be related to Mr. Darcy. The names are a dead give away: Letitia? (who is purely boring); Camilla ?? Traditionally children were named after relatives. Jane, Elizabeth, Georgiana, Mary, Catherine, Lydia, Charlotte. etc.But then it is impossible to believe that any of these silly, mannerless, oversexed, vulgar young women could have been brought up by the Darcys. Camilla grows a little but her love affairs are not believable. What are we told about Wytton that would make anyone love him?And then ""Aunt Lydia?"" What connection has she to the giddy brainless Lydia who runs away with Wickham? And Caroline Bingley?This book has no connection with Jane Austen. It is a much-too-long badly plotted Regency, who's author has used Mr. Darcy's name as a selling point."
2,very sad it did not live up to my expectations,"I didn't even have very high expectations. After reading this I thought that people should leave well enough alone. You cannot possible match up to Jane Austen. The book was very disappointing. The characters were annoying, I didn't like how colonel fitzwilliam was portrayed at all. I would have thought he would be more agreeable. The daughters of Darcy and Elizabeth were not very engaging. It is a quick read however. It lacked character development and I don't feel I got to know all the sisters. it read like a regency romance novel. There was not natural wit to the writing. Wow. . .I was pretty harsh. I guess you should read it as a romance novel but not as a sequel to Jane Austen."
4,Not Austen but Great Fun,"I never expected to read Jane Austen when I picked up this book. That's probably why I enjoyed it. It's a good Victorian novel for an afternoon's read. Great fun for those who have read P&P. However, if you want to read ""more Austen"" purchase _Emma_ instead."
2,Couldn't even get past page 41.,"This archly coy wanna-be was replete with a number of errors that any halfway decent historical novelist should have caught. The Season starts in March, so people are returning to London then, NOT leaving it. And a woman being the victim of a would-be fiance's amnesia is NOT grounds for denying her vouchers to Almack's. People married younger in those days, but for the Darcy twins to say they had 17 year old friends who were already married a year? Mr. Gardiner was Mrs. Bennet's BROTHER, NOT her UNCLE! Nor was he ""in trade"", per se; he was a solicitor. Has this woman even READ Pride & Prejudice, or just the Cliff Notes (tm)? And those are just for starters. Badly contrived and far too derivative of what the author thinks the original was."
5,FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO DISPLAY SOME PATRIOTIC PRIDE...,"There is nothing wrong with displaying a little patriotic pride. This is a red, white, and blue bumper sticker that is easy to read, as well as tasteful.In this day and age, where more and more of our global neighbors seem to loathe us, it can't hurt to display a little patriotism in this fashion. I am, as the sticker states, ""Proud to be an American."""
1,Should be at the bottom of the ocean,"I was searching for music pertaining to the actual ship (songs played on board, written about the disaster). This is just cover artists performing music from the score for the James Cameron Titanic movie. I should have looked over the titles more carefully. Don't buy this album when you can get the real soundtrack in good condition elswhere on Amazon."
3,good music but not like the old stuff,"This album by EC seems too progressive for some fans. What i heard i didnt expect to hear, which sometimes isnt a good thing. a Suprise was Karl trying to rap in some of the songs,and songs were not as raw. some good songs though, ""Behind the Wire"", ""mass arrest"" which is more like their old stuff. this album is still good if you dont expect to hear old EC"
5,Top of the line earth crisis!,I am a huge earth crisis fan and love all their albums but this one is the best so far. The band has tweaked they're performance to excellent status. The vocals are much better and it compliments the music even more. Well worth the listen.
2,What happened?,"What the heck happened to one of my all time favorite Hardcore bands? Once a tough, growling, ripping S**T up band, now a metal, melodic, rappy band!! Sure this is album is solid, well if you review it as itself and not compare it to past EC releases. Guitars are very well done, trading licks and riffs back and for. Bulldog is tough on bass, pounding away with hardcore fury. Drumming is sick as usual. But here is the bad part. Karl once a great hardcore singer.....raps and sings. This is not Earth Crisis, i really dont know what made them take this path...maybe they thought this would make them a huge band..Well they were huge, well,in the hardcore scene. I give the 2 stars for the effort and for the great artwork on the CD. If you want classic EC, buy ""All Out War"", ""Firestorm"" or ""Destroy The Machines"". My personal favorite is ""Gommorah Season Ends"" which is a hardcore classic."
3,Earth Crisis - 'Slither' (Victory),"Problem with 'Slither' is that it doesn't cover any new ground.I mean,it's on okay release by the metal band,just nothing special.Noticed that mainman Karl Buechner has toned down his rather menacing growl to include cleaner vocal arrangements.That COULD actually work here.Tunes like ""Loss Of Humanity"",title cut ""Slither"",""Biomachines"" and ""Hair Trigger"" appear to be decently penned out.See what you think.Might appeal to some fans of Fear Factory,Korn,Machine Head and Biohazard."
1,sad sad sad......,"what the hell is this? this is the worst one to date. it falls into the limp bisquit rap/metal category. the singer tries to rap on this, what a mistake, well i guess we'll get to see this one on MTV."
4,Surprisingly good with catchy material!,"The Hollies were a great group and they certainly had 'staying power'. But they were a 'singles' oriented group rather than one known for their albums. So apart from a few albums like 1966's ""For Certain Because"" and 1974's eponymous ""Hollies"" album, few of their albums have had the consistency of quality that you really look for when considering buying a whole album. But surprisingly, ""Staying Power"" does have a consistency far beyond the patchy quality of most of their late 1970s (and beyond) albums. There are four or five gems: Prove Me Wrong, Weakness, Live it Up, Yesterday's Gone and Let Love Pass. These songs offer a slightly different sound to their traditional hollies sound, but the album is nevertheless tight and well produced."
3,Hmm...eh...,"I was excited to get this one, but when it arrived and I watched the videos, I responded with an ""eh...*shrug*""...The videos, I thought, pretty much sucked. They were in black and white and you couldn't see what was going on in them very well. There were a few videos that I don't have of AIC that are on this DVD, but I'd save your money. If you are a true AIC fan, you'll buy the Music Bank, which I already have."
5,Ripstein's best movie EVER! (IMHO),"This was the first movie by Ripstein I ever saw and although it's obviously low-budget and looks dank and dull, I loved the way the story and acting work together to examine the destructive effects of paternalistic power in a small community. The main actors - 'Manuela' and 'Pancho' - work miracles. The actor who played Manuela particularly is incredible at portraying a lack-lustre, down-at-heel transvestite/brothel madam in such a way as you identify with her and see her particular beauty clearly. I don't know why he didn't work in more movies, but... that's life! The inevitable violence of the end leaves you gutted and, more incredibly, understanding what the forces were that led each person to act as they do; you see the true tragedy as not down to individual blame, but social forces working through people, locking them into insane courses of action. Watch this, if you can get it..."
4,A great treasure marred by low-budget constraints,"Any fan of arthouse Mexican films or the deeper of the gay-themed genre must own this just for Robert Cobo's great portrait of La Manuela, a down-and-out transvestite in rural Mexico putting up with machismo and hypocripsy in Latin culture. It's a brutal film, at turns touching, always incisive. Man, films have gotten increasingly stupid and shallow since this gem appeared. One can also learn about the life and conditions of rural Mexico -- they're tough, in case you haven't been there. Now try being a drag queen with a daughter and a bunch of horny, frustrated machos making your life worse. As a reviewer herein notes, the film is fair: it makes known that it's the social forces that repress and steer people into violence. The treatment of all characters is fair.See this oddball, brave flick."
3,"Good book, but boring material for children","I've been teaching with this book for the past two years and have mixed feelings about it- The introduction of reading bass clef and other concepts is good, but the songs that follow are quite dry. Students get very excited at the occasional recognizable song (Ode to Joy, Twinkle, etc.) but the rest tend to be extremely repetitive and don't hold their interest well at all. I will continue to shop around for a book that teaches beginner technique in a more enjoyable form... Let me know if you have any suggestions!"
5,Great companion resource to SQLXML BOL,"This book is an excellent addition to the documentation provided with SQLXML, especially if you are just starting to use SQLXML. The book helps you decide if SQLXML is right for your situation. If it is, the book will continue to walk you through some real examples, covering some of the pros and cons of different methods. Being a developer, I highly recommend this book if you are using or considering to use SQLXML in a Microsoft environment."
5,Recommended for all SQL Server 2000 Developers and DBA,"Even though this book is one of the first attempts of Curlingstone press, the book is by far one of the best covering how to use XML in SQL Server. Most other books are copy cats of MSDN online refrence but this book stands out by covering SQL XML 3.0 in great detail and explains each and every topic with very good practical examples.I highly recommend for all the developers who want to get the data from SQL Server 2000 in XML format. The book also covers in great detail about programmatic access of SQLXML in VB6 and .NET.If you are planning an integration with Biz Talk server and SQL server or if you are planning to expose your Stored procedures through Web services, I think this is the only book which covers those topics through case studies.I strongly recommend this book to all SQL Server 2000 Developers and DBA's."
4,"A grounded-feet, hands-on approach on using XML with SQL","The recent breed of book on XML technology put database applications on its target. However most developments are far from being suitable to daily programming tasks.This book's approach is refreshing for any programmer working with Microsoft SQL 2000. It shows uses of xml technology with this relational database but spares the reader the frustrating ""some day you be able"" prehamble usually found in texts about recent technology.Each topic is followed by ready-to-run samples. Of course XML technology is a bit foreign for relational database administrators, and these topics demand a fair degree of explanation. Anyway the book balances appropriately the theory/samples ratio."
1,Too narrow,"This book is technically competent, but goes right past the two most important factors; if you are developing XML, then you will probably be using Java, and that if you are developing applications (even with XML) on SQL server, then you are probably using COM+. Sorry."
1,Waste,"Wasn't surprised from the price, but some advice, dont waste your money. Going in the trash. Very poorly put together."
4,confusing,These are for traditional O and O27 track only. It does state that but it should be made more clear because if you look at what people are buying with it you'll see Fast track which is Lionels newest track and this set won't work with it.
2,Not impressed,"I had to purchase this software for a class in my masters program. It doesn't do much more than the free image programs that came preloaded on my computer. I rarely use it now that my class is over. I use the full version of Photoshop at my job so it was pretty annoying to find that it wasn't similar to the full version at all. It was like using a completely different brand of software. And the photo manager that came with it was pretty annoying too. Advanced users will probably be annoyed by the program, but it is fairly simple enough for moderate computer users. If you already have image editing software on your computer you might as well stick with what you have. If you don't have anything at all, this program does get the job done. I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't have to have it for class. Although I didn't use the scrapbooking stuff that came with it, it did look like it had some cute ideas for making photo albums."
5,Great Combination,"I purchased these two products separately, but the combination of the two can't be beat!! I am amazed at the things you can do to photos with Adobe Photoshop Elements. I had been using it just to edite pictures and it's super for that, of course. But combine it with The Scrapper's Guide and you've opened up a whole new level of creativity. Linda's software takes you step by step through some pretty amazing projects and really let's you see and understand the enormous capabilities you have available through Elements 4. Just a warning - digital scrapbooking CAN become addictive!!"
5,Scrappers Guide,"With Scrappers Guide's training videos by Linda Sattgast, bundled with the newest Adobe Elements4---you have all the keys, tools and ideas to make today's moments become tomorrow's best and prettiest memories.There just couldn't be a better combination for Digital Scrapbookers everywhere than this is."
5,Best Gold Panning Set Ever!,"Gave this set to my husband for his birthday, he loves it! We easily panned out gold and we are very, vey new to this. Now my husband has gold fever in a big way. The panning kit comes with helpful instructions and is really easy to use. Great for the whole family. Quality product, fast shipping,"
5,Great value,I reviewed many items to finally make my decision on this item and supplier.My girl and I do everything together and this kit is big enough for both of us to enjoy at the same time without purchasing individual products to increase the size of our kit. I highly recommend it.Shipping was a little slow but i think that was more me then them.I like stuff now.Great buy for the value
4,Good Product.,Have not tried it out yet. This is a gold panning kit set manufactured by Garrett. The molded pans seem to be heavy duty enough. Judging by the many Youtube videos on gold panning - this is the one to get.
5,Deluxe gold panning kit,Great product. 3 different size pans and a classifier. The two books included go over most of the same information. The retro dvd included made gold panning look easy until you actually get to the river and begin panning. Look forward trying it again in the summer.
4,grandson loved it,my grandson is into panning for gold or thinks he is - he is only 6 but we are going to take him on a trip this summer to pan for gold and he will get to try this kit out then
4,Gold mining,This is def a quality product. It is came with everything and the instructions are well written. Good purchase for families.
2,Bad instruction,"I'm a purple belt in bjj, and I'm sorry but this video is really bad. Yes, it has a lot of techniques, and it's cheap; but you get what you pay. Moves are rushed, mostly not linked and without any strategic consideration. But the primary problem is that they aren't explained in detail and most of them are actually performed incorrectly.The reason why I don't give this instructional just one star is because not all techniques are bad, although all of them lack important details. In my opinion the performer himself have not mastered the moves, and he shows.On the site (google kibun) you will find a few clips, keep in mind that they are not the worse and judge yourself."
2,Pretty amateurish,"A hodgpodge of travelogue, history, ""boys on their own"", and memoire, this didn't compel me to read it. I finished it, but barely. Not a great read."
2,Boring,"Obvious was a little boring...don't know if it pertains to today's business world, but it is a simple book to read"
2,Not that great,Purchased these pillows expecting something great. They are the same as pillows you buy at Walmart. I wouldn't recomend these pillows.
4,Good Nights Sleep,I first slept on this pillow at a Best Western and had a good nights sleep. I got the name of the pillow from them and found it on Amazon. My husband even noticed an improvment in rest.
2,Cheaply made,"If I knew that I was going to get a cheap tee with iron on letters, I would have made it myself"
1,Very Informative,"This is a great and informative video regarding the presidents of the United States.It starts with George Washington and ends with the current president. The video reviews their personal lives and time in office, as well as their impact on U.S. History. It also has a section about the wives of the presidents which was extremely interesting. For anyone who is interested in learning about our presidents and their time in office - this is a great video - would recommend it!!"
4,Easy tutorial,A great streamlined version of biographies for every one of our presidents. I disagree with some of the analysis but thats what makes it fun.
4,that's life,kim's the best on the harmonica that i've ever heard and his vocals are so very soulful he makes me have the shivers
4,"Louis Sclavis, please","Should Amazon want to sell this record to a wider audience it should start by spelling the musicians' names properly. Spelling Louis Sclavis, Louis Sclacis does not look good on your web page."
5,"Delicious Phrasing, Luminous Sound","If you haven't heard the Los Angeles Chamber Singers, you are in for a treat. If you haven't heard this album you will enjoy the depth and variety of the selections. Alternately transcendant and ebullient, these very extraordinary voices float and soar, and the richess of their ensemble leaves me with an almost tactile sense of its luminosity. I was particularly moved by Morten Lauridsen's ""Les Chansons des Roses."""
3,Great CD1. Where did CD2 come from and why?,"The first CD is great and typical of a MOS trance type CD. It features a great mix of all the great anthems found on many trance/ibiza style cds. The first CD flows well (although the first song doesn't belong) starting with bingo bango and then on and on with airwave and darude's sandstorm hi-gate's pitchin, etc.But, then you put that second CD in and its almost something from out of the collection of your little sisters cds. I mean these two cds really should not have been sold together as a package. I am a true trance listener buying and religiously listening to all of the new trance music. When I saw that this CD had darude and higate and chicane, I immediately (as many of you probably will) thought that this is just another great CD to add to the collection. Buyer beware! Still love that first CD though so it wasn't a total waste. Good versions of the trance tunes and great mixing as well. Just not the second CD!!"
2,Monotonous in a promised variety,"I was expecting a collection of children's musics from very different cultures, but they are sung by the same person (with an unnatural operistic voice) and played by the same orchestra. Therefore, what could have been a promised variety is, despite the best intentions of the singer, a monotony."
5,"Surprise, Surprise","I am an avid mystery fan, Agathie Christie being my favorite for years. Michael Craft has really done an outstanding job in this book. I could not put it down and read it in one day. That is very unusual for me to do, I usually put a book down and then come back a few days later. The characters are all believable and delightful and by the end I felt they were friends."
5,This is no ordinary writer,"Cleverly crafted, top notch writing. Craft has a real love for the language and it shows. I cared about these characters and their outcome."
2,"so-so, hoping next is better","I've read these in sequence, but agree with one review below that this entry was a bit lame. I was able to guess the murderer well in advance. The text seems contains frequent descriptions of perfect meals and perfectly accessorized clothing of the characters; this was very tiresome after awhile, and does a disservice to the gay community by perpetuating the image of gay men as being materialistic and shallow."
5,Highly recommend!,"Put this on your must read list if you are expecting twins or if you already have infant twins. It mixes humor with the details and specifics of what you can really expect. Lyons' realistic view of parenting twins reminds you that it will be challenging, but incredibly fun. While packed with important info, it still offers the personal, emotional and human side of what you go through with your bundles of joy. Even after my experiences of having my 2 'singleton' sons, I still found this book invaluable when we found out my twin girls were on the way. I read at least a half a dozen multiples/twins books, and this is the one that I bought to keep on hand. Don't miss this one!"
3,Its okay,The best part is where it tells you how to feed two babies at once (bottle or breast) and how dad can do it too!
2,A disappointing read,"This book is self-published and it's very obvious by the poor formatting of the book and the ""information"" contained within.As a mother of twin boys pregnant with my second set of twins I had hoped for a better book to ""refresh my memory"" of life with twins and suggest to other new mothers of twins...This book sadly is not one I can suggest.The useful information in this book geared specifically towards twins/multiples fills about 3 pages. Otherwise the reader would be better off buying ""the Girlfriends Guide to.."" series by Vicki Iovine or ""What to expect the First Year""The book rambles on in many different directions and doesn't really offer any REAL useful advice for a new mother of multiples (or any mother for that matter).Better reads for new mothers of multiples would be:1.) ""Mothering Multiples: Breastfeeding & caring for twins or more"" by Karen Gromada2.) ""When you're expecting twins triplets or quads: a Complete resource"" by Barbara Luke"
1,Not really a twins book,"I was looking for a funny tongue and cheek read about twins that would also provide some good information on having and raising them. However, I was disappointed in the amount of twin specific information in this book. In addition to this, instead of providing a lighthearted perspective for my wife it caused her to get stressful about the prospect of having twins. The book may advise for one to have a sense of humor about having twins, but it certainly didn't seem to provide one.I wouldn't recommend this book as a twins book, nor would I recommend it if you are trying to give your wife a coping read. The authors of this book may consider themselves ""REAL Experts,"" but I REALLY wish I hadn't bought this book."
1,Marriage venting not advice,The author seems to spend the more time complaining about what her husband doesn't do then giving real advice. I was very disappointed it the book.
3,"Pretty good, but a little dissapointed","I've read a couple of twin books so far and this one was probably the most daunting. I finished reading it in a few hours and afterwards felt completely overwhelmed. I had a different experience with the book, ""Baby Wise"" for example-It instilled confidence and excitement in me. It made sense and was encouraging. In Lyon's book she focused on most of the problems you face with twins and a couple of tid-bits from her experience. She kept mentioning walking up and down stairs and how difficult it is to do this--I guess this doesn't pertain to me-she also comes from a background of already having a toddler when taking care of twins. Also not what I'll be experiencing.That being said, I did like the fun comments about having a lot of chocolate on hand, the ease of cooking dinner with a crockpot and not being afraid to ask people for a specific type of help."
3,"A funny read, but...","It was cute, but not a Girlfriends' Guide-quality manual. Very much a formula-feeding, Ferberizing kind of ideology. (The fact that it takes so many pages to tell you how to formula feed your twins should be quite revealing here. I feed my twins in 20-30 minutes inclusive, simultaneously, and if I had to wash 20 bottles a day, I would scream. But if you want to know how, she'll tell you.) First-time moms might really get the wrong idea about breastfeeding based on the treatment of the subject here -- get a second opinion, for the sake of your sanity! It is far easier than formula, after about a month. The book does prepare you for the weird questions and comments you will get as a twin mom. I thought she was overstating things -- but no. The public is amazingly intrusive, and you might want to be prepared. Bottom line: I'm still waiting for Vicky Iovine to have twins."
2,Exaggerated,"I was disappointed by this book. Even though there were a lot of things that I, mom to newborn twin girls, did recognize, most of it however I did not. The book makes it all see much worse than it is in reality - or do I just have such easy babies? I don't think so.Also, I totally disagree with the statements about breastfeeding. The writer claims that it's nearly impossible to breastfeed twins, and I disagree. It's definately not more work than feeding them bottles! And there are no bottles to be washed afterwards."
4,easy quick read but not thorough enough,"surviving the first three month is key. my twins both had reflux. the book had no suggestions on how to deal with this. their reflux not only affected their feeding but also their sleeping. these two things consume your entire life when it comes to newborns. the book was a good general overview, but i found the NOMTOC multiple group websites with advices from MANY multiple mothers more useful. it's ok to buy it and read it, but don't stop there in preparation of the biggest change you have ever had in your life."
3,Amusing & easy read,"Not bad- and it was easy to read through. I will be going back to see if there is anything I can actually use when my twins are born. I am not sure what I was expecting when I purchased this book, but it seems that with this one as well as the other twins books I have gotten, I am expected to be much more affluent than I am in order to get much help from the books that are out there. I recommend getting Twins Triplets & More, instead of this."
5,The Girlfriends' Guide to Twins!,"A great book that addresses a much-needed topic. It's a quick read, but that doesn't mean it is light on helpful insight. It's written in a positive style (""You *will* survive, things *will* get better""). Not sure that we'll be making our own baby food, but at least that's included in the Appendices. Overall a highly recommended book for parents expecting twins (or more!) or those with recently delivered multiples at home."
2,Missed Opportunity,"This book felt more like a gossip commentary on the woman who wrote this book and her local mom friends than something that others could learn from. This book could have been a real help for me but it missed the mark. The author of this book has infant twins AND and older daughter, as do I. One of many challenges of the last year has been how to give the babies all that they need emotionally and physically while managing the development and emotional state of my older daughter. Practical advice was missing -- things like how do you take them all shopping at the grocery store? While the original message may have been lost in the editing, it seemed like her older daughter was ignored during the babies first year."
1,very dissapointed!,"If you have children already and you`re pregnant with twins, the book won`t teach you anything.I have a 3 years old girl and expecting two more girls.I knew 90% of information the book has to offer.And to be honest with you, if you`re mature enough you don`t need this kind of advice, like ""don`t leave children unattended while bathing them"" it`s pretty obvious and doesn`t refer to twins only!Save money for diapers, this book doesn`t worth it!"
5,An invaluable resource!,"An absolute ""must have"" for expectant parents of multiples! As a mother expecting twins, I was unable to put the book down and laughed hysterically throughout the process. The book is definitely written from the perspective of a mother of twins who has been down in the trenches herself and eloquently portrays an honesty about what it's really like to have multiples. The book made me want to meet the author...I feel as if we've been girlfriends forever!"
4,"Great ""food"" episodes, especially around Birthday Time...","This is one of the first Blue's Clues DVDs with the ""new"" program formatting... where Blue becomes a puppet in the ""Blue's Room"" segments of the show (instead of being ALL a cartoon figure). This particular DVD has three Blue's Clue's episodes and one ""Blue's Room"" only episode, which all feature ""food"" items. The food items mostly surround a Birthday theme, so this is a great DVD to watch with your child around their Birthday time. :) Although I personally like the three full-length episodes's format over the ""Blue's Room only"" episode, I found this DVD very enjoyable and I highly recommend it."
2,Wasn't what I had expected,"This book just wasn't my cup of tea. While I took away maybe one or two pointers away from the total read, it purely was written with the alcoholic in mind. NOT the family member being affected by the alcoholic. I was greatly disappointed in the content matter of this book. I had expected a more well-rounded source of information, not to just reflective opinion and direction on how to handle your alcoholic. This book was not horribly written, however, it would not be in my top five to recommend to a family member affected by an individual's addiction."
1,Post Rozz/Gitane DeMone/David Glass CD .... as usual...,"The only highlight here is the Cradle of Filth take on "" Peek a Boo ""; because unlike Valor, Cradle know how to play Gothic Metal. The rest of this montonous fifth rate attempt at being metal and being shocking make the Valor bogus Christian Death sound tired and old. ....to the wonderful sound of ""Ashes"" and "" Catastophe Ballet "" the albums Rozz Williams ( the TRUE Christian Death ) & Valor collaberated on; or the brilliant post punk Death Rock of "" Only Theatre of Pain "" the album Rozz Williams , Rikk Agnew, George Belenger,and James McGerty first established the band's existance with ( did u see Valor's name mentioned in that,anyone?! )Only for those who want a good laugh. I just wish Valor didn't insist upon bringing the moniker of a great band to new lows with this garbage.Kaenan James 1340"
4,Nice but very small,Bought this for my husband and it is nice but really small. It was the only one I could find in the color I wanted for a E series Mercedes.
2,Not for the office place,I purchased this unit and immediately returned it in exchange for the IN26+ for two reasons. The resolution is so low that you can see the 'screen door effect' in the image and the color saturation in a semi darkened room was completely washed out even after spending a couple hours trying to adjust it. It is probably fine for general use in a fully darkened room but as a business projector where ambient light conditions are a constant issue I would steer clear.
5,InFocus IN24 DLP,This is a great projector for those looking for a more affordable solution.I had no problems setting up or using it. It has a good picture and brightness when hooked to a DVD player. I have not tried it with a Laptop yet.
1,Is missing alot,While these seem to be high quality and the voice overs have been redone...they also leave out parts of each episode. I was told the Kai ones are uncut...but they are not. So far every episode I have seen has about 2-3 min of the episode missing when compared with my old ones. I find this weird as they do have more of the blood graphics left in but have extra other stuff missing.
1,IT BROKE IN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES!!!!,"I was on a trip when this arrived, after 3 weeks of having it, i finally decided to tune it. When i was trying to tune the 6th cord, the NUT broke!!!!!, now i know why these guitars where so cheap! i'm very very dissapointed. I couldn't even return it since it passed almost 4 weeks.----------Estaba de viaje cuando llego, despues de 3 semanas de tenerla guardada, por fin me decidí a afinarla. Cuando estaba afinando la sexta cuerda, el hueso se rompio!, no podía creerlo, ahora se por que estaban tan tan baratas. Estoy muy decepcionado de este producto. Ni siquiera pude regresarla pues ya habían pasado casi 4 semanas."
1,NOT WORTH THE TIME,"I SAT DOWN TO READ A GOOD MYSTERY BUT INSTEAD IT IS A POLITICAL BOOK CRITICAL OF REPUBLICANS AND GLORIFYING DEMOCRATS.IT IS A BOOK WITHOUT ""DEVELOPED"" CHARACTERS AND WITHOUT A ""DEVELOPED"" STORY.IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD READ--GOOD MYSTERY, SAVE YOUR ""TIME AND MONEY"". DEFINITELY ""NOT"" WORTH IT.RATING SHOULD BE ""LESS"" THAN 1 STAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Fish lover,I bought these to go in my Betta tanks. I did not receive them for several weeks. It turned out that even though the money came out of my account the order was cancelled. I contacted Amazon they did get me the product. The holes in the decorations are a bad size. My betta got stuck in the hole we got him out but he died a couple days later. I put them in a tank with larger fish and they are fine.
1,"Cute and works, but the photos ...","I got this camera because I wanted a cheap way of taking photos of some items I own for online auctions. My plan was to take photos of only static objects in well-lit areas so I wouldn't have to worry about the quality of the resulting pictures. Unfortuntely, the quality of photos ended up being so poor that no amount of photoshop editing could help and I ended up returning the product.It's definitely a cute camera and it feels and handles beautifully, unfortunately, it fails at its main purpose, which is taking at least decent (or at least recognizeable) images. A better choice is to save up some cash and get one of the neat digital Elphs by Canon (great quality photos, cute and slick, and handles great)."
2,[shodd]y and poor,"the size is really nice, but it ends there. the picture quality is very grainy along with the video, no amount of settings could fix that. not worth the amount of money, spend a little more and get a better webcam. my 20 dollar webcam has better picture quality then this guy."
4,"Useful, Small, Overall Good","I have to say the camera works great, if you know how to use it. In answer to those who say that the pics were not of high enough resolution, use a higher resolution. This camera is so small you can carry it in your pocket, without having a bulging huge looking pocket. It has a good battery life and overall may not be as good as the other cameras, but for it's price, and size, it is reasonable."
2,Don't,"Once you get this camera your going to wish you spent the extra money to pay for real camera. It takes good pictures out side and terrible pictures inside, it doesn't have a flash so don't expect to see anything. After I got this camera I bought the Kodak EasyShare CX6200. Which is a better camera and just about 50 bucks more. So spend the extra dough and get a better camera. You'll be disappointed when you get it. Basically you get what you paid for 26 bucks for a digital camera, Come on Get Real"
2,Perfect for my application!,"I got this camera for free with my Lexmark printer, so I can't complain about the price. It is very compact, lightweight, and simple - perfect for ""aerial surveillance"". I mounted it on my R/C powered sailplane to take aerial photos. Unfortunately, I set it to look through the prop. It looks like the pix were taken through venetian blinds! I revised the setup so it looks straight down, and that works ok. It just takes some fancy maneuvering to take a pic. Picture quality is pretty bad, but it can also be used as a webcam, video cam, and for stills. The manual (on CD in several languages) is remarkably good."
1,Don't waste your money,This is the worst camera I have ever bought. As soon as I replaced the battery the thing went dead. The pictures were decent but the quailty of the camera is awful!!
1,Disorganized Information.,"This text was required reading for an introductory cataloging class. I have found it to be difficult to navigate as an introductory piece. The writing is sub par and it is clear that this is a second edition work.For example, the author will introduce an acronym and fail to identify what it stands for, or you will find materials that should be restricted to later chapters incorporated into earlier chapters, which creates a scattered organization feel.Her work in Wynar's Introduction to Cataloging and Classification is of significantly higher quality and is more apropos for an introductory level class than this text.All and all, I would not recommend this text fro an introduction to knowledge organization. Hope you never have to work with it in class... and if you do, pick up supplementary materials, you are going to need it."
1,"One of the worst Library Science textbooks, if not the worst","This is the most boring, hardest to understand Library Science text I've had to read in my graduate career, and that's saying something. There's too much dense language, obscuring the meaning of what the author was trying to say. Consider, for example, that the author spends time talking about ""metadata about metadata"". The information in this book could be presented in a much more straightforward, concise, clear manner."
1,Very disorganized presentation,The publisher should have submitted this book to an end user panel for an overhaul on the presenbtation.Semantic maps and webs would do a world of good for the organized presentation of the inforamtion in this book.The current poresentation is chaotic to say the least.
2,"Required reading, really didn't like it","Only get this if it is required. It's dry reading, and not much fun at all."
4,Good material and worksmanship,"Doesn't fade, shrink if you follow the label before washing. No need to iron either. The collar does not fade, shrinks wither. Has pen slot on left sleeve."
3,no title,"This book is a basically a rehash of her great book, ""Breaking the Chain of Self Esteem."" Her imagined characters are a little unbelievable; and worse, she inserts not-so-subtle plugs for her practice in the story line! Offers no real explanations of specific sexual disorders."
3,It would be 5 but...,"TOO LOUD! If it had a volume control or something it would be VERY nice. I find myself covering the volume with my hand half the time. Also, the toys it comes with aren't very interactive (ie: hard plastic, not posable) except for stethascope. Otherwise it's a pretty nice toy. Maybe a bit pricey considering it doesn't do much except contain some plastic toys and play some music, but it is a brand name so I guess that explains it! Otherwise the owner likes it very much, however he likes a cheaper and quieter toy (Mr. Potato Head 3 Friends Set) he got at the same time much, much more!"
2,cute but doesn't always work,"My son likes his rescue pack although it stops working for a few hours at a time. Also, it requires batteries that look like they would fit in a watch (not AA like this website lists)."
2,"Great toy, but mine stopped talking and exhibited some erratic behavior","This toy lasted great for the first few months. My son loved it, and the sounds it made.However, it started to go downhill from there. When you hit the button to play a sound, it would only play a little bit of music, then stop. I immediately thought it was the batteries, but even after replacing with many new sets of LR44 batteries, it still exhibited the same behavior.I'm thinking it might be a loose soldering joint on the inside, but I haven't opened it up to check the connections."
3,Good toy,"I purchased this for my two year old grandson for Christmas. He likes it because when you press the tongue on the rescue pack, it sings the song and it say a couple of phrases. He likes the stuff inside as well but that was not his main attraction (and he loves Diego). He now plays with it just to hear the song. The inside pieces are ok but not an eye catcher for him."
4,Cool!,Grandson loved it . The music he played over and over.And he rescued animals . Lots of hours to play with.
4,Diego Rescue pack,"The product was good, and Amazon's customer service great. But we've had the toy for about a month now and it seems there are some glitches. Perhaps it is the batteries, but this soon?"
5,diego backpack,"an excellent toy to buy for your child or any child. educationaL, DURABLE, ENTERTAINING and not expensive."
3,Could be better,"My son really likes this toy, but he can't open it on his own yet. The clasp could be more kid friendly. He's 2 1/2. Also... he has asked me several times if I can help him put it on his back. The thing has no straps which is a real bummer. It's kind of loud, but so far hasn't bothered me. He loves feeding baby jaguar his food. Anyway, he seems to like it, so I guess that's all that matters :D"
4,Rescue Pack- Comin' to the rescue!,"This was a Christmas present for my friends two year old little girl. She fell in LOVE with this toy as soon as she opened the package! From the bright colors and (albeit) loud sounds, she can't get enough of The Rescue Pack! She loves the ""kitty"" that fits inside and her big sisters dance to the song it plays, which makes her laugh even more. She's a bit afraid of the stethoscope I think- she won't wear it and keeps hiding it. I bought the toy at a much lower price than what Amazon is selling it as; however, I would probably buy it again at this higher price just to see her eyes light up and that big smile on her face again."
1,Waste of MOney,"This is a hard plastic and is not a back pack at all. The volume of the talking pack is deafening; really bad for young eardrums. The toys aren't easily removed or placed back the pack. The pack is also difficult to open, even with adult hands."
2,Batteries Quit,"The battery died shortly after purchasing...like within a week. Therefore the backpack doesn't talk anymore, and we are forced to simply sing the song ourselves..."
3,Just okay,The reason that I gave this rating is because the batteries were dead and I had to spend another $6 for newbatteries and the package didn't look quite new.
5,Smooth jazz cd,love !! this cd !! will be buying more of Warren Hill he is one of the best sax players around
2,Disappointed,"I got this book expecting to read about the secrets of Castle Amber, to put a ""face"" on the Pattern, and to see some COLOR pictures of the beautiful artwork described in the books. None of that happened. There was no color, only black and white floorplans of everyone's rooms. ZZZ. Worse, they made all the Amberites obsessed with Earth. They made it seem like they were all there all the time, with everyone having a decor drawn from Earth. And worst of all, the authors made no effort to give a picture of the Pattern. I always have a hard time trying to visualize it.For nonfans, this book is filled with allusions to the other books, so it may pique your interest to read the others. For someone familair with ""Corwin's story"", it was very very tame."
3,Dandy Candy for the Zelazny Fanatic,"Steeped in succulent tidbits of Amber lore as this book is, it nevertheless has simply atrocious illustrations, crudely drawn and obvious, committing crimes in black and white thankfully left unsaid in color. Years ago, after eagerly obtaining a copy on its first printing I sadly found my finely spun images of the people and places that cast the shadows I adored in Zelazny's world butchered to such an extent I simply gave it away. Recently however, a new friend's eyes sparkled so at the mere mention of possession of this crude tomb that I must bow to tradition and give this book its due; it has apparently a worthy place in the frugally documented world of Amber. The parts I liked best had to do were descriptions of those places whose location was mutuable, such the Hall of Mirrors."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Some detail on the layouts and structure of the most used setting in the Amber world. For afficionados only.Castle Amber is just, that, a castle, so you woulud almost have to be interested in castles or castle design to be keen enough to get this, if not an Amber freak."
2,Disappointing,"As a Kosovo Albanian woman living in the United States I was very excited to see a movie that was discussing my home country and the current situation there. I wanted my husband, who is not Kosovo Albanian, to see it and get better insight on where a came from and what my countrymen were still going through. Unfortunately, the movie was a complete disappointment. While it does portray the grave situation in Kosova, 7 years after the war, the flow of the story is very confusing as it comes and goes from one story to another only to return to the first story without finishing the one prior. Also, the translation was not good, with a lot of words misspelled, a lot of sections not even translated, just a very poor translation job, which was a problem since my husband does not speak Albanian. This movie was very confusing and does not do the current or the past situation in Kosova justice. Therefore, do not recommend it."
3,Johnny B: How Disrespectful!,"I guess back in the day I didn't realize how actually rude and disrespectful Johnny Bravo is to women but he definitely is. Not something you would want to teach your kids so they probably don't even need to watch the show for that matter. Only episode was really hilarious was ""Talking Tabitha"" that doll is seriously crazy. I watched the rest of the DVDs to see the cute little redhead girl Sally, she was so adorable!They did pack a solid amount of episodes on here however so I appreciated the length of each DVD, it was worth the low price in that sense, but I wouldn't waste anything over $10 for it."
1,NO VIDEO AVAILABLE,NICE - NONE OF THE VIDEO ON THIS PAGE ARE AVAILABLEWHAT THE HELL IS WITH THAT?GOOD JOB
2,You get what you pay for,"I received this battery, which is sold as new and was quite clearly used. Works about as good as the battery I needed to replace."
3,cheap replacement,"i got what i asked for...cheap battery. it easily gets hot even on a less than an hour talk time, but it works. just have to charge 3 times in a day...hmmm still better buy the original..."
5,Ateco Sugar Paste Daisy Cutters,love..love..love.. these cutters. So easy to use on fondant and make beautiful flowers. Easy toclean also.
2,Spring Doesn't work,"The leaves are beautiful, but the spring keeps popping up... when making a lot of leaves decorating with it becomes a very tedious process."
2,poorly made,"The cutters fall apart and the springs don't work to imprint the leaves. I was disappointed, but won't bother to send them back because they were inexpensive and can still be used as simple cutters."
3,lily cutters,I didn't realize they were so small i was very surprized u should say how small they are I need some bigger ones for the flowers i am going to make but happy with the detail.
4,Just what I expected,This product was just what I was looking for. They are easy to use and good quality. I would recommend them to all.
3,Ateco Set of 3 Sugar Paste Heart Cutters,"These are great cutters and work well. I am very happy with the results achieved and it is so easy Nice to use and easy to clean.I have enjoyed using them and believe they are well constructed and will last a lifetime.My only criticism is the price when it converted into my currency with shipping, it became rather expensive."
2,Ateco Set of 3 Sugar Paster Wide Leaf Cutters,"I was a bit disappointed with what I had received, I needed wide leaf cutters which I thought would have included a large size wide leaf for the cake I was decorating. And so I am not happy with the purchase, it should best be describe as small wide leaf cutters. The biggest leaf in the package is as small as a new leaf. Also, on the package what needs to be included when advertising, is the size of each leaf, and the package should include a large size leaf cutter, one the size of a mature maple leaf."
4,Leaf cutters,"These are hard to find, was happy to have found them. It took a little longer than expected to received them, but was glad to get them."
5,"A good item, but not really needed.","I purchased this after reading other reviews about it. Thought it was needed for close-up shots, but when I looked at the tripod (a SLIK model PRO 700DX-AMT) I had ordered at the same time, I found that all that needed to be done was to remove the bottom cap from the origional center column and take the center column apart (it's screwed together in the middle) then re-install the end cap onto the upper section of the center column and that was it!This piece wasn't needed, at least for this model of SLIK brand tripod."
3,Good hard science fiction,"This is an entertaining hard science fiction novel. It shows a different take on trying to contact alien species which we have not considered. Our radio broadcasts reach another alien species who are xenophobes and whose philosophy is let's get them before they get us (and it's nothing personal). It's rather amusing to see the basis of how they came to judge the human race. This book could as easily been twice as long as it was if the authors had cared to develop the characters more. The book follows various groups of survivors and their strategies for avoiding the aliens, some are successful and some are not. There are a lot of interesting scientific concepts presented in the book which make it a good read. If you enjoy the ""hard"" science fiction of Larry Niven, Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, I would recommend that you read this book."
1,Pass on It,"IMO, this book is the archetype of what a science fiction book should never be, I mean filled up with pseudoscientific theories that will quickly be obsolete. Paradoxically, all that pseudoscientific lore gives way to a mumbo-jumbo completely unbelievable. Nothing holds out. Already, 15 years after the book was written, many hypothesis are laughable. Pretty amazing because the authors are supposed to be serious scientists. Let alone the story is nave, not to say simplistic."
3,"Mediocre writing, compelling story","I bought this book mainly out of curiosity as to how and why an alien species would consciously annihilate us, and the book truly does offer up a very strong argument as to the why. As to the how, I was less convinced as I thought that any civilisation capable of exterminating another on an interstellar basis would run the strong risk of making itself a target for any other species if they were to use such violent methods as were used in this book.The writing itself is of mediocre quality and I got the feeling the author(s) was (were) more interested in trying to impress people than in writing a gripping story. That the story is gripping enough simply because of the utter darkness of almost total extinction is a testament to how bad such a scenario would truly be. Be warned, it is very depressing.Still, the whole premise is interesting enough to make it worth reading."
3,so so,"A few interesting good ideas---the logic of relativistic bombing and the advantages of keeping quiet.however, the book itself is poorly written. outright mediocre. more like a collection of ideas, many taken from elsewhere, strung together.this is made worse by the fact that the authors are obviously megalomanic (Pellegrino's wikipedia entry is similar.)"
3,"Interesting concepts, but weak story","What would the United States do if it found out that a primitive group of tribesmen in outer mongolia (or Kosovo) developed nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them?Would we nuke them first?Would we nuke them first if we had no morality or peer pressure, only logic?What if we felt that they thought we would nuke them the first chance we had?Would we not be logically forced to nuke them first?"
3,Compatibility Guaranteed,"OCZ wants a fortune for their 2GB version of this product. However, you can use any MicroSD card with the rest of the device. In my case, I put a 2GB Kingston card into the adapter. I am now able to transfer files between cell phones, computers, and cameras.In order to make the package more useful, I've got a bootable version of Backtrack3 on the drive, along with: The Sleuthkit, Hijack This!, PS Tools, and Windirstat. You might even extend the device further with portable apps, but for my needs the above tools are sufficient."
5,nipsey russell sucks,"garth brooks rules. if you don't like country music, why did you even listen and give a review about it?"
5,Great!,"Although a Garth lover, I haven't owned all of his CDs -- until now. This is such a great idea and, thankfully, affordable. If you're new to country or new to Garth, pick this up before it's gone.By the way, some of you were wondering about LIVE SONGS. I saw him at one of his four shows in Charleston, W.Va., February 1997 and he was recording some/all of those shows for a live record."
5,All and more,"I have this. This has every CD put out by Garth (except sevens, doble live, Greatest hits, & Scarecrow) All 60 songs plus 1 never before, unreleased song on each CD for a total of 66 songs. Plus a lyrics book for evey song. Buying this will cost less than buying each one seperatly...I love mine and recomend it."
5,Great Idea,"I have been a country music fan for some time but the only CD by Garth Brooks I owned until the release of ""Sevens"" was ""The Hits."" I had nothing against Garth or his music, I had just never purchsed any of his other stuff. I bought Sevens and loved it, so when this was released the following May, I bought it. It is great. I love a lot of his older stuff that maybe didn't get any airplay, and the new additions fit in perfectly with the albums they are on making you wonder why they weren't there the first time around. My favorite new cuts are ""This Ain't Tennessee"" and ""Anonymous."" I also love ""The Fever,"" ""Which One of Them,"" and many others. There are really too many to mention. I have since purchased all of Garth's materials, including ""Double Live,"" the two Christmas CD's, and the ""Chris Gaines"" project. I would reccomend them all, especially ""The Limited Series"" for those who didn't have any of Garth's older material."
2,OK,"There's alot of good songs but if you don't want to waste your money just buy the cassette and the ""Hope Floats"" CD and you'll save a bunch of money."
3,its alright but nuthin special,"I dont know why Garth even did this box. Now yes, its a bargan for new fans,66 songs for only $...,but what about us that have these cd's already? Come on Garth,why didnt you release a whole new cd (maybe that duet cd with trisha that you PROMISED us but never got around to doing)????your motive behind this project is beyond me...maybe you could explain it to us true fans,because i certainly dont get it."
5,garth is simply the best,"I've listened to all of Garth's albums I haven't seen him live yet but I have seen many video taped live performances and I have to say that he one of the most exciting performers out there right now, and as far as people saying that his music lacks heart and meaning listen to ""It's your song"", ""The River"", ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" , the list goes on.. I wish people in the media would get off this guy's back already, one thing is for sure the media will build up artists one day and then tear them down the next but at least the fans stay loyal and the music will always be there for us ... the true fans ... the ones that support Garth any so many more...he must be doing something right...GARTH just keep making great music"
1,sheer garbage,"C'mon people wake up! There are so many artists who deserve your money more than this guy. I mean the guy sells his cds at McDonalds! All he cares about is out-selling the Beatles. Do you really want a world were Garth Brooks out-sells the Beatles? Ah, I give up, the man's (only) talent is marketing and people are gonna buy this junk. Would you like fries to go with that?"
4,Awesome Set!,I loved this boxed set of Garth Brooks Cd's. I owned two of his Cd's before this set. I bought the boxed set because I wanted too many other songs off the other CD's and it was easier to buy the whole set than just single CD's.
5,Gruberova: the best Donizetti's Anna.,"I have been looking for this Nightingale recording for years. But it was worth doing it. Although some cuts (anyhow, not dramatically as many as in Callas' edition) are done, everything which must be there, is there. Perfect symphony (maybe Boyninge's interpretation was a bit more clear), great Smeton, namely the first ""aria"", interesting Percy's Bros interpretation (not shouted, gently sung) but incredible Gruberova. The best, without any comparison, Donizetti's Anna. Gruberova alone is enough to buy these CDs."
5,Pray and prosper,A clear inspiration book to pick up and read for a moment of inspiration to set your day or to redirect your attention during a challenging moment!
5,Love it,Perfect! This goes with my set and I love it! Can't wait to use it! Just like my flatware it looks fancy but I can still use it everyday
1,Damaged,The box is what we wanted but like someone else had said about the box coming damaged. That is what happened to us also and we had a customer waiting.
1,Dangerous,"Any sword that is only $15 is in fact very dangerous. These swords are called wallhangers because they are only designed to by hung on a wall, not swung. The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself. (Called the Tang) In a real martial arts sword, the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself. If you swing a wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang, and fly off and hurt someone.If you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words: anatomy of a wallhangerAny sword designed for real martial arts practice- like Iaido, starts at $250 not $15, and should be bought at a reputable Iaido store. (sorry I am not allowed to recommend web sites here).So be smart, either hang this sword back on the wall, or throw it out before your baby brother/sister hurts someone."
2,Cheap but not quality = fair enough,First of al it is not stainless steel. It has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap...Handle is not that reliable it is like it's gonna break easily I mean don't think of any usage. It is only for decoration..
1,For Display Only!!!,Great feedbacks from J. Leigh.This sword is for display only. Try swinging it around and you'll see what happens. They should add that to the description.
4,Very Good,"this is a quality sword from the movie ""Kill Bill"". Yes, it is Uma Thurman's (The Bride's) sword.WARNING: DOESN'T COME WITH A STAND!!!"
1,Low Quality - Not Meant For Use,This sword is like the 440 High Carbon Steel that is cheaply made. You would need to get the 1045 or 1060 High Carbon Steel to do any cutting.
2,Not the *toughest*,"I guess I expected these crosswords to be along the line of the Sunday Times puzzles. Briefly, if you like your crosswords really tough like I do, these ones will be way too easy. I put the book away after doing only a couple and haven't touched it since."
1,Never received my book or credit from supermoviedeals,"Supermoviedeals took my money, shipped the book to the wrong address (by their own admission) and, after two requests from me, still refuse to credit my account."
4,fun music,like the music sit with friends have some brews and even dance its all there in this album gave four stars you can give it five
4,Everything it needs to be...,"Great product if your car has a input jack for mp3 players but not a dedicated Ipod input. Sound quality is much better than the headphone jack and you can charge your Ipod while driving, however you can also run off the Ipod batter if you need to charge your cell phone."
3,SiK imp for iPod - great but missing one important thing,"This product is exactly what I've been looking for - a charger with a line out for use with a tape-deck style adaptor kit. It performs as promised. The problem, however, is that the sound you get is very distorted. Could the product be too good/powerful? The solution, I've learned, is to add an aftermarket in-line volume controller. I did that and now I couldn't be happier with the end result but am not too happy about all of the cords I have to deal with! I would highly recommend that SiK consider adding an in-line volume controller to their product. I would rate them 5+ if they had that. If you don't mind the extra few feet of cord (from the in-line volume controller), this product is great and very handy."
3,Predictable but Entertaining,"This book was very predictable, but also entertaining. I enjoyed reading it, as I enjoy most chick lit. For anyone that likes a quick and ""fun"" light read with a happy ending, this is it.This is also the first book I have read on my Kindle. While I found that reading on the Kindle was wonderful, there were several ""glitches"" that I came across. For example, where there was supposed to be a quotation mark, there would be "". I don't know if it is bad encoding, but I personally found them distracting and annoying."
4,Just Friends is Just Fun!,"This is the tale of Freya. She's a new yorker (displaced from England) in her early 30's & single. The novel begins with her going out with her boyfriend to an expensive meal. She believes he is going to propose to her, when in actuality, he wants to break up. So begins the hijinks that carry on for the rest of this book. Freya moves in with her friend Jack and begins to date men through personals in the back of a magazine. But it's the last place she looks where she finds true love. But is it too late? Read this novel to find out. It's well written, funny, & the characters are well developed. I'd recommend it as a good vacation or airplane read."
3,so-so,"The book started off interesting enough with Freya getting dumped by her boyfriend. You later realise though that they are not emotionally compatible. Freya's character is a little cold. Its a little bit of an emotional roller coaster in the middle of the story as you can easily anticipate how the book is going to end. Its just that getting there is a little `dry' at times. It gets a little tedious in the middle when Jack and Freya work out their disagreements. Things spice up a little when they make their way to London pretending to be a couple right up to the point where you think, `how could he do that to a friend???'. The ending could have better expanded, it could be more `explosive' given the nature of both of characters. Still, it is a nice book to read if you have nothing else better to do."
5,Can best friends live together?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. It is well written and you learn a lot about what happens when people take others and situations for granted.This is the story about Freya and what happens when her boyfriend ""dumps"" her on the night when she though she would be getting a ring. One thing leads to another and she ends up staying with her longtime friend Jack. (The writer)The real issue is that Freya needs a date to her stepsisters (might I say wicked stepsister) wedding back in England. What happens when Jack decides to help her out and go as her date?Also what happens when Freya starts to get annoyed with Jacks ""teenyboppers from Planet Bubblegum"" girlfriends?Lets just say some of the misunderstandings are things that I have seen people do in real life and it is a GREAT story!"
4,Just Delightful,"Robyn Sisman has hit the mark with this new book. ""Just Friends"" is a delightful romp, that certainly wasn't what I expected when I picked it out. It's full of great scenes and I just love the mix of settings. You would think this could be classified with the whole ""brig jones""..""lucy sullivan"" family... but, you'd be off the mark. While I am a huge fan of those books, this books takes a whole new twist and the ending is a bit of a shocker. Give it a shot... I think you'll like it."
2,no good,I was very disappointed in this book. The story was slow and the female character made me want to strangle her. A disappointment.
1,"with friends like this, etc...?","Immature... smug... arrogant yet insecure. It's really hard to sympathize with a character who is so completely self-absorbed, bitter and judgemental. What were her redeeming qualities?It sounds like I'm alone in this, but I found it hard to relate to her -- it really seemed that she was unloved throughout most of the story because she was ... unlovable."
2,"unoriginal, with flat characters","I feel like I have read 100 books like this lately--Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married, Thirtynothing, Ralph's Party, etc. And those were all better than this one. While Just Friends has an interesting enough story (although lacking in originality), the characters are one-dimensional and the book was very predictable."
3,"Fun read, but could be better","I picked up this book when I was looking for something light-hearted for the weekend and this fits the bill. Freya was likeable, I guess, mainly because she is what many modern women living in the city are fast becoming... demanding, neurotic, self-centred, worried about age.... etc. Somehow I find that rather relatable.The story is pretty standard and predictable but there were funny parts and the style of writing makes it relatively stress-free to read. Good for a weekend if you're looking for something light-hearted but it could have been better with more rounded character development and more funny parts.If I were to compare, I prefer reading the story of a neurotic, 30-something city dweller's quest for romance in Helen Fielding's ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" but Sisman's Just Friends has its merits for a light-hearted read."
4,An Entertaining Tale,"Though from the start you could probably guess where the book would end up, I found this a thoroughly amusing read. Each chapter always left me longing to know what would happen next. I do, however, agree that Cat and Michael could have been developed a little more. Overall, a satisfying read."
4,Enjoyable ...,"Although I think ""Perfect Stranger"" was much better than this, I think this one wasn't that bad. Yes, it was predictable, and the main characters (Jack and Freya) seemed a little bit childish, but still I enjoyed reading it."
4,Good if you like games,"I am more a traditional learner so I was a bit disappointed to find so many games, word seeks, and matching in this workbook. However, if you like it when a teacher makes learning fun and you learn better this way, this is probably the best workbook for you.My only true gripe is that there's not enough space to actually write in the workbook! It even suggests that you use separate sheets of paper to do the exercises. To me, the point of a workbook is to do the exercises in the book. But, its not that bad of a flaw.Overall, the workbook as a variety of exercises and vocabulary and I'll keep it for the extra practice."
1,junk,"I odered this item with the weaver mount for my ruger mini 30the first problem i had while zeroing was the windage adjustment was marked backwards so i had to adjust the windage the opposite directionafter i figured this out the windage adjudtment was maxed out before the scope was ever zeroed at 100yds leaving my zero 2 inches to the left with no way to adjust it.this product is not worth the shipping cost to have it delivered let alone the cost of the scope.If you need warranty work you have to send 10$ to ncstar for them to ship it back to you.The range instructor who helped me mount and try to zero this scope told me about 1 in 50 of the ncstar scopes he sees work ok,so i would assume the quality control for there products are very poor and would definitely not trust them to fix it correctly, or replace it with one that worked if i sent it in for waranty work.I definitely DO NOT reccomend this product."
4,arabic in 10 minutes a day,"I started out with one book, then got 3 more for my children. I homeschool, the book is in an easy format that allowed me to plan lessons (i.e vocabulary, practice writing). However, the arabic letters do not always correspond with the english translation(mainly the vowel placement when the words are in english, does not match the arabic script sometimes, but not often enough for me to not use the book totally). If you know the arabic alphabet and vowels you'll catch this right away. Over all the colored pictures and easy format help keep the children interseted, pulse they are learning lots of new words. The ""Arabic Alphabet,how to read and write"",(Lyle Stuart) and a good arabic dictionary like ""Arabic, practical dictionary"",(N.Awde& K.Smith) are used alot to get me though the spelling and reading. If you don't know anyone that speak arabic you may want to try ""Living Language Arabic"" program, it comes with a book and CD. Take your time and enjoy."
5,Glen Campbell's second Masterpiece on 1967,"Glen Campbell / By The Time I Get To Phoenix:Very few artists are able to release two good albums in one year, let alone two Masterpiece albums as Glen Campbell did in 1967. After his amazing ""Gentle on my mind"" album, he released this ""By the time I get to Phoenix"" album and met with the same great success as the previous release. Much of that success comes from the fact that he followed the same pattern of using various songs from various songwriters from various genres, including a couple of his own songs. Not only does Glen use Jimmy Webb's title track, but he does his great versions of songs from Paul Simon, Ernest Tubb, Bill Anderson, Jerry Reed, and others. This is another Masterpiece. This one earns Five Stars."
5,Highly recommended,Highly recommended tribute to one of the greatest artist of our time. A must have for all serious music fans.
4,Not bad for Campbell fans,"Far better than the ""best"" album. Richer sound albeit not as good as the LP upon which it is based. At the price, a real bargain."
5,Great text book,We needed a text book for social studies. This was the one we needed. It was used but in really good shape. We use it everyday at home. Excellent purchase and priced very reasonably.
4,Same as Chilton's!!,"I couldn't decide which manual to buy so I ordered both Haynes and Chiltons. They are exactly the same word-for-word. Same Photos. Layout is slightly different. Apparently Haynes has purchased Chiltons. Other that that, technically the manual is fine. Everything I expected."
4,great informative guide for a novice,"I have used this book several times to change out headlights, trouble shoot engine problems, and check codes that I have pulled when my check engine light has come on. Not knowing a whole lot about car repair, this manual is an invaluable (and easy to understand) tool."
1,Misleading Title,I have a 1999 Nissan Pick-Up with a diesel engine. The manual only covers gasoline models but the title gives no hint to this.
4,Nice proyects,This is a nice book with a lot of patterns. I personaly liked only 3 or 4 out of the twenty something. But over all a nice book.
2,Won't keep out grackles,"It's important to know that while this may keep out squirrels, it WON'T keep out those ""thug"" birds.I hung this feeder out today, because my local bird store told me it would keep out larger birds. Well, the grackles just love it. They've been hanging on it all day. Because the cage is only 8"" in diameter, their long beaks easily reach through the cage to get the seed, and they've been jealously guarding it as their personal food source all morning. Sorry songbirds!"
1,CHEAPLY MADE,"THIS TENT IS NO GOOD FOR ANY TYPE OF WIND OR SLIGHT BREEZE. ALL OF THE ""HOLDING"" RINGS RIPPED OUT OF THE MATERIAL ITSELF. THE SIDES ARE HELD BY CHEAP VELCRO THAT ALSO RIPPED OUT OF MATERIAL. WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS FOR ANY OTHER WEATHER THAN A 95 DEGREE DAY WITH NO SIGHT OF ANY KIND OF BREEZE OR WIND IN THE AREA. ALSO WHEN WE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT, IT HAD DIRT SPOTS ON IT THAT WERE GREASE LIKE. NO WAY WOULD I RECCOMEND THIS TENT FOR ANY OCCASSION. WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT BACK"
2,"You can make it work, but......","This tent is super basic, and you CAN'T set it up with one person. I'm a small 5'1"" woman and I BROKE one of the side frames trying to open it by myself, its very cheap aluminum. And it does leak, and its kind of short, you'll feel like your tent is short compared to all the pretty and tall easy ups at craft fairs.... if someone GIVES you one for free I wouldn't turn it down, but don't go buy one because it seems like there are better and cheaper options out there."
3,"Cute, but not rugged.","In doing craft shows and farmers markets for nine years, I have owned a number of E-Z Up style tents. This one is attractive and goes up more easily than most, but that may be due to its one drawback - it seems rather insubstantial. Everything about it is very thin and flimsy-feeling. I plan to use this tent when the weather is predicted to be clear and calm, and buy a stronger tent for a rainy days or leaving the tent up overnight."
3,love it but carry bag tearing on both ends,tent bag carried is tearing on both sides and had to use screws on to sides of canapy as the push in button not popping back out
2,LASTED 2 DAYS,its a nice tent until any kind of weather hits it. it might work better indoors.i have to throw it away and i havent even paid for it yet
2,Horrible,I had it set up for a couple months and then a windstorm came and bent one of the sides. The tent is totaled now. That shouldn't happen. Its horrible and cheaply made.Don't buy this tent. Its also not completely waterproof.
1,The worst purchase I could ever made.,"Oh! My. I got this product in June, 2010,it was a 10X10 though, and price was the original plus shipping, used for the first time June 5, put it away and open it back to use at Father's Day Jun 19, we had a quick rain in the afternoon and when I looked outside to continue my decorations for the next day, there was this ""quality"" product all crocket, and they will not refund my money because they already knew was a bad product. Do not buy it. If you want something to last a little more then 14 days do not buy it. But if you do want something as bad as this one you can find cheaper so at least you do not waste that much.:("
3,unit was not very sturdy,"Bent a strut the second time it was erected, less than 5 mph wind at time. Strut bent before I could tie structure down."
1,Unbelievably bad,I was literally shocked at how bad this product is. I teach a course in which we have to know the wind velocity as part of a computation. There was a five knot wind when we set it up and it immediately began to fold. The horizontal cross members are connected with the flimsiest connection I have ever seen and they were unable to withstand a five knot wind. The top continuously caved in on the upwind side.I tried to call the company and was told someone would get back to me; no one ever has. Do not buy this tent it is a total waste of money.
3,This product isn't as great as it's expensive price tag.,It has held up well enough but my husband has had to replace a bolt in it. My mother has the same exact one. She hasn't had it two months and it needs something replaced on it that has to do with the frame. They will not replace it and the item she needs to fix it is still out of stock. So yes it works good enough. Every craft show vendor has one but the price is crazy and the customer service is no better. Would I buy another one? Maybe.... It's a tent and there isn't anything too much better out there. My cheap $100 one lasted awhile too.
1,cheryl in new york,This canopy is not worth 6.99 let alone 69.99 plus shipping. What a rip off! My daughter and I used it this week end for our first craft fair and this is what we encountered when we opened the box. The ropes were not long enough to anchor the canopy. The sides did not fit properly. The zippered front and back was ripped along the seam of the zipper. The zipper on the carrying case popped apart. The one side of the canopy was bowed in and definitely not sturdy. The so-called stakes were the diameter of an oversized paperclip. Do NOT waste your money. We were extremely disappointed and very embarrased by our canopy. Thank God it didn't rain or have strong winds. Atleast someone was on our side. I would not suggest this canopy to anyone. Ours is going to the dump and chalked up as a very bad experience and big waste of money.
2,waste of time,I am a vendor - i do 49 weekends a year of indoor n outdoor shows.This product and the 10x20 gazebo I bought is pure fiction.The material used in manfacture is substandard.It bends at the joints the first time we tried to put it up.what was sent was 2 10x10 ez ups - and beleive me it was not ez to erect.do not waste your money
4,it rains right trough,"I have used the canopy twice now at art fairs. It is very easy to set up (with two people), and looks very good. However something I did not know about these canopies is that they are NOT waterproof. When it rained during my first fair, the rain came right through the fabric... So bring an extra tarp along."
1,Broke after using twice!,I was highly disappointed in this product. The tent broke the second time I put it up! Broke in 1 place 2nd time putting up and in 3 more places when we took it down. It would cost me more to ship it back than it's worth! I will not buy another tent!
3,Not easily set up by one person.,"I bought this canopy because it was advertised as easily erected by one person. Unfortunately, that did not prove to be the case. That's too bad for me, since I do not have a helper at the arts and crafts shows where I sell my handmade items. The quality of the canopy seems to be good, and it is probably a relatively durable item, but, alas, it's not much good to me if I can't handle it myself, and let me just say that I am physically strong and coordinated."
4,very happy with tent,i purchased this for a festival. i am very happy with it. i have set up for 3 day festivals several times with this tent. it worked just as well as the other vendors ones that they spent 300-500 dollars on.
2,Tent that failed in the wind,Didn't hold up in wind. Good for good weather. Should have bought a better tent. Broke several items for sale.
1,Worst Pop Up Tent,"I have used many types of 10 x 10 tents for craft shows. this one is ok for keeping the rain off and easy to put up for one person.However, the materials used are very cheap. All of the plastic pieces broke within the first few weeks of using it. The metal sides are permanently bowed inward from a little bit of wind. The tent (yes I have weights to hold it down) doesn't stand up for anything in wind. The walls are frayed and ripped where the Velcro is that attached them to the tent. And the carrying case is worthless. Save your money! Buy a real EZ Up!"
3,Canopy,"I loved the canopy / gazebo what ever you want to call it, to me it's a canopy with walls. When we got it put up it looked so good. But after about 4 days of being up we had a really strong wind storm & when we woke up the next morning it was crumbled into the middle. We are new to this area & didn't expect it to get that windy when they said a little windy through the night, so need less to say I was very disappointed when we had to take it apart & throw it in the dumpster. So make sure you take it down when it's windy other than the hastle of doing that I loved it & wasting our money."
5,Great Product! Sturdy & Easy to Set Up,"Bought this tent to use at an Art Fair 1 block from the beach; where there is constant sea breeze. The tent took about 5 minutes to completely set up (with two people) and the construction is very sturdy. I never once felt like it would blow away! Large and roomy too! The only issue I had was that we could not pack the tent and sides up as neatly into the carrying case as the manufacturer. Had to leave the bag unzipped or risk damaging the zipper. But, not a big deal to me. Maybe if I took more time in collapsing the tent and putting it back in the bag, it would have fit better. Otherwise, I love the tent and would recommend this one (and I have already) to anyone looking for a sturdy yet affordable pop up tent."
4,Canopy Tent,This is a really great canopy tent: easy to move about and easy to set up. Just wish that it came in another color other than white (will really show dirt over the long haul).
2,Very dissappointed,"I was very dissappointed with the purchase of this item, after setting up in my yard that night we had winds of less then 10 mph and the canopy blew across the yard and broke one of the top legs @ the push button, making theproduct useless for future use, I evev staked it down with much stronger camping spikes.It however was good for the single day it was used in blocking out the sun."
5,Pop Up Canopy w/Walls,Tent arrived promptly. The weather has been too cold to set it up and check it out. Amazing price. Cann't wait to use it.
1,absolutely trash,"when we rec'd. item, it looked like it was dropped from an airplane and the box flipped over about 85 times. also the seams on the carrying bag were coming apart. thumbs down!"
2,"looks great, very cheap built","this product looks great when first set up, by the end of the first day, half the velcrow tabs came off because they were not sewed on very well, some of the seams were pulling to get the walls attached, everytime the wind blew, and it wasn't a very windy day. Couldn't get it back in the bag because the zippered ripped right down the side becasue the material was so cheap. Second set up, one little gust of wind, and it collapsed and bent the ceiling frame. now I have a useless tent.this product might be ok for indoor use, but made with cheap materials."
1,Sadness,"Sadness is what the tent has brought us. We thought maybe we'd been setting it up improperly, causing extreme wear and tear (after probably 3 uses), but after seeing all of these other negative reviews, it's clear that this is an inferior product. Please spend your money on something better-made with sturdier materials. The bag ripped the first day we used it, and the metal ""structure"" of the canopy was soon to follow, with bars snapping in half where they were screwed together. The thing is a piece of... garbage. Learn from our mistake!"
1,not worth the money,"I purchased this tent to use at arts and crafts festivals. The first time I set it up two hours into the festival a gust of wind came along and bent the aluminum frame so badly we had to pack up and go home and the tent was ruined after one use. No other tents in the festival were damaged, the stakes to hold it in the ground were so flimsy that we could bend them with our hands."
2,Pretty but not practical,I ordered this product and it came right away which excited me. It was as it stated as a pop-up canopy which excited me. It looked beautiful when I put up the side walls which thrilled me since it was for my daughter's bridal shower. The first strong wind knocked it over which disappointed me! When it knocked it over the steel bent and broke and the canopy was unusable and had to be taken to the dump. My son-in-law to be had to help me cut it apart because it was broken and could not be pushed back in to it's original fold-in position. I was very disappointed with this item.
2,Window plastic and cords disintegrate in 6 months,Window plastic and cords disintegrate in 6 months. Otherwise good product. Need to replace bad window panels.
5,canopy 10x10 with side panels.,"This is above average the canopy works well,easy to erect,and dismantle,carry and store.the price was awesome too."
1,EZ Pop Set Up Canopy Tent Gazebo,"This pop-up canopy has a very flimsy frame that bent and broke the very first time I tried to open it (carefully.) It might be appropriate for a one-time use or an indoors use, but it is extremely light-weight aluminum that bends with a woman's fingers. I decided to keep the canopy because I liked the side walls which are attached with tie-tabs and velcro tabs. The fabric is very white in color and seems to be sturdy enough and I like the plastic windows. I can tie the side walls to my commercial-weight canopy frame with ease."
3,canopy tent gazebo,"I ordered this for an event, it arrived broken, as if someone else had it, broke it and returned it. I reported it and a new one was shipped. I recieved it after the event. This year I used it once, then next time i used it the braces on the side came apart. The bolts holding it together broke. I believe if you pay good money for a product, you should be able to use the item more than once. Very unhappy with the product and the company."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"We purchased this canopy as shade to display at craft fairs. The price was reasonable, set up and take down a breeze and the look is very polished. After reading other reviews I was concerned when a 3 hour thunderstorm arrived while using our tent. Not waterproof, but very resistant, even in downpours. I highly recommend this canopy!"
2,Very low Quality,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this canopy. I do art booths and sometimes need one to be white so I bought this one as is is much cheaper than the other options for white canopies with sidewalls. I left it set up for a weekend in my backyard with weights on two legs and the other two up against a wall in a corner. When I got home the frame was broken in two places and the canopy material torn through in two places. I would not recommend this product for anyone who is looking for durability or longevity. It was a the best price, but it seems in this case you do get what you pay for."
5,Love it!,I purchased this tent for my daughter's birthday luau. It is wonderful! Easy to put up with the help of my 5 year old daughter. We will use it again for my older daughter's graduation party. It is perfect for family parties to keep the rain off or provide shade. It comes in a bag that zips up and can be put into the trunk of a car to take to the park or camping. I would highly recommend this tent to other families. It looks so elegant set up in the yard as well. I wasn't sure if 10'X 10' would be big enough but it provides plenty of room.
3,easy set up -,"I have used this tent for an arts festival - it was super quick to set up and looks good - the only negative thing I have to say is that the legs when fully extended wobble. I used the ez sand bags to anchor the tent and this helped stabilize the structure - I felt that the tent work best at the mid height setting, so for talker clients/customers they had to duck down slightly to enter the exhibit - otherwise its a good starter tent for my festivals - if I decide to continue doing this longer term I will purchase a more substanial structure - it's also definitely water resisitant so big plus there.Maria /Q Art"
1,Do not buy,Did not see the reviews before purchasing. This is a useless tent. Bars bent as we put it up the first time and no returns allowed. It was a present from my sons to my husband and a waste of money. This should be removed from Amazon
5,love this product from Amazon,I love this product the two wall with windows are great. it is sturdy but not to heavy to carry. I will order through Amazon again
2,Received damaged,"Although the canopy is fairly easy to put up, one side of the metal structure was bent causing it to sag. Also, one of ""pop outs"" in one legs will not pop all the way out so there is no way to keep that corner of the canopy up. Unfortunately, we needed to use the canopy the week it was received so we could not return it. I will not purchase from this source again."
1,Poor Quality,"I used this for 4 craft shows. It is extremely awkward, takes at least two preferably three people to set it up, and is not durable. The braces are extremely week and actually broke clean in two places and the one leg refused to hold. Piece of junk, don't waste your money."
1,10x10 popup,the 10x10 popup arrived with one damaged leg and a broken zipper I have put in for a return but have not received a response yet and its been a week. if the zipper was not so week I think it would be fine at this point I just would like to get my money back
1,not worth the money,"This was a nice little sun shade, but the other day we were expecting rain and I had to do some carpentry work outside. I wanted to set up my saw and cut under it. I left the tent for about 20 mins. while working inside . The whole thing collapsed. It's not worth your money"
1,Easy pop set up canopy tent,This tent collapsed and the metal snapped after one night of rain. The water did not flow off but instead gathered and the weight caused it to buckle. It would probably be fine for a one day event but we needed it to be standing for a week-long childrens camp. The company did reimburse us as the tent couldn't be fixed or reused.
2,for sun only,We live in Oregon so bought the canopy for rain more than sun. Don't buy this for that reason! THE TOP IS NOT WATER PROOF! It leaks everywhere there is a seam.
1,CABANA,"I BOUGHT THIS iTEM IN fEB 2011, THE FIRST TIME i PUT IT UP A CORNER POLE BENT! I CONTACTED THEM AND THEY SENT ME A NEW POLE FREE! THE NEXT TIME I PUT IT UP 3 STRUTS BROKE. I CONTACTED THEM AGAIN AND THEY SAID, (AFTER 2 OR 3 COMUNICATIONS) THEY DON'T SELL SPARE PARTS AND I SHOULD FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO REPAIR IT!! I WOULD NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM BESTCHOICE PRODUCTS AGAIN!"
2,looks cute but not a good buy,"It broke after 3 set ups... the metal frame is too thin and cannot withstand several uses.... I wish I would have purchased another one.Looks really cute when up but if you can spend an extra few buck, get a better stronger kind."
1,doesn't last,I purchased this wine cooler and it worked fine until about 2 weeks after the warranty expired. It is now a useless piece of junk that will cost more to repair that it is worth. Don't waste your money.
2,doesn't hold burgundy bottles,"As simple as that, this unit cannot accommodate burgundy bottles. Crammed in so that labels tear against the shelves, I've managed to store twenty three burgundies. It'll have to do for now. The heartbreaker is that the unit has the capacity for more, it's the design of the shelf brackets that fails to accommodate the larger girth of burgundies. I call that a serious design flaw and give this unit a 2 star rating."
5,Best new Blues Album in years,"This CD was nominated for a Grammy in 1995, it should have won, but that's politics... This is Doug Sahm and Rocky Morales at their Bluezy Best. A must have. The Doug-Heads"
4,"Obscure Brit hard rock, early 70's","Good hard rock band with lots of guitar riffs and solos. As others have posted they sound like Led Zep and Free; and if you like those two (and what hard rocker doesn't) you should like Leaf Hound. ""Work My Body"" plays for over eight minutes with riffs and strained vocals of Peter French, who sounds a bit too much like Robert Plante. Liner notes details the history of the band, includes song lyrics. A good buy."
2,Eh!,"This album is okay. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. The artwork is great; the music is so-so. Kind of like a collection of Free demos. I've listened to it a few times, but it never really struck a chord with me."
4,great,"These guys played hard, bluesy, riff based rock, late 60s-early 70s style. They are heavy and loud, and their riffs are chunky and drop like a hammer.They are not as inventive as Led Zeppiln and not prog-tinged like early Deep Purple. Yet their guitar playing is great, and these are truely loud, metalic songs.For the standards of their era, this was some of the hardest rock out there. It's hevey edge stands up perfectly today. Absoulutely enjoyable album, that can shread the paint from the walls, 40 years on."
2,Loved Nick????,What happened to this character? I didn't even know him. I loved him in all the other books(Whitney My Love and Until You). She should of gave him his own book to make us understand why he fell in love with Julianna in the first place or did he ever. I really can't remember it was so short and forgettable. These characters deserved much more than this. This is the only time I haven't like a Judith McNaught book (I guess its not a book but a short story) I loved all her work up until now. Couldn't wait to read Nicks story only to be disappointed. Don't waste your money.
3,Fine Short Holiday Fictions,"Fans of Judith McNaught's Westmoreland novels will love hercontribution to ""Holiday of Love"". It's the long-awaited lovestory of Nicki DuVille, and, though far too short, was wellworth the wait. I will tell you only one thing: she is a womanyou have seen before.The first and last stories, by Devereaux and Lamb, are morethan a little drab. ""Daniel's Angel"" is a lovely bit offantasy about a fallen angel and hard-hearted Scrooge who findthat they need each other."
4,Short and new,Great book which looked like new and not used at all. Judith McNaught does well again although it would have been nice to know that the stories would be significantly shorter.
2,IS THIS IT?,"I was really disappointed in this story. Not only did Nicholas deserve a full novel, but he deseved to have a better heroine! Of course, there can only be one Whitney but couldn't he have someone who had the spice and life of Whitney? I'd much rather preffered it if Judith McNaught never wrote this story so that we can imagine a better story for Nicki in our minds! Nicholas DuVille is one of Judith McNaught's greatest characters- I can't understand how she can write such a disappointing story for him!"
3,"More Niki and Julianna, please?","I fell in love with the Westmorelands and their friends ever since reading ""Whitney, My Love"". I was thus delighted that Ms McNaught has decided to write a story on Niki and Julianna.To my great disappointment, the story on these two lovable characters were entirely TOO SHORT! It was such a pity to ""waste"" these two interesting characters in a story that lacks both character and plot development, not to mention the unconvincing way Niki and Julianna fell in love.Perhaps Ms McNaught could consider expanding on their story?"
1,Completely Disappointed,"First, let me admit that I bought this book solely to read Judith McNaught's story. I only recently stumbled onto her and after reading Whitney My Love and the two associated books, when I read that this story was about Nick Du Ville, I quickly ordered the book.What a total disappointment. Even without knowing that the characters of Nick and Julia Skeffington are characters in the other books, this story doesn't hold water. It reads like an outline. And it could have been a great book in and of itself. Why go to the trouble of creating such a wonderful character as Nick, having him very visible and playing rather large roles in previous books, then dismiss him like this. Better not to have written any further about him at all.In fairness to the other authors whose stories form this compilation, the fact that I was so disgusted with Miracles made me completely uninterested in reading them. Shame on you, Ms. McNaught. If I could give you zero stars, I would."
2,disappointed,I bought this book solely for the story about Nikolas Duville. I enjoyed reading the rest of the books by Judith McNaught that involved the Westmorelands and looked forward to seeing how Nikki's story would end. I was really disappointed that 1. he only got a short story and 2. his story wasn't even full of the twists and misunderstandings that Judith McNaught puts in all her romances. Hopefully Nikki and Julianna's story will eventulally get a full book but it doesn't look like it.
3,Far too short!!!!,"Nicki deserved a much longer story than this, I was most disappointed with this short story."
3,"lite reading for the season, a mixed bag",A collection of holiday-theme trash novellas. The first two stories (about a middle aged woman set-up by her son and a romance in regency England) are much stronger and better than the second two (a corny tale about a fallen angel and a convoluted yet boring story about medieval Scotland). Nice lite reading for the season. Grade (first two): B+ Grade (second two) C-
2,UTTERLY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!,I feel so devastated to read the story on Nicholas! I have been looking forward to his story after reading her note at the back of one of her paperbacks...I even had difficulty in finding this book but to my surprise!...it's like a short story kind of thing...I just hope that JM would redeem herself from Nicholas...I just don't know how she'll do it though....
3,This synthetic Thiamine is made to be fat soluble...,"Fat Soluble thiamine, is reportedly very effective in treating the pain and paresthesias associated with Diabetic Neuropathy. I have taken it for less than 2 weeks and I do notice some improvement in my non Diabetic neuropathy. I have suffered from a Statin Induced brain injury, with resultant Neuropathy..and to date this is the only improvement in my neuropathy symptoms."
2,DON'T KNOW,"I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND SEE KNOW RENOUND IMPROVEMENT IN MY HEALTH. THE SALES PITCH HAS ME HOOKED, BUT ONLY TIME WILL TELL. THEY ARE WAY TOO EXPENSIVE AND IF THEY DON'T DO AS THE MFGR. STATES, THEN I WAISTED A LOT OF MONEY."
3,Amityvixen's Review,"The entire series contains myriads of plots that seemed to entangle the main character Ling ""Linghu Chong"". The second volume seemed to have toned down a bit since Vol 1 where all the characters were introduced in a very fast pace and made it quite confusing. Vol 2. Disc 1 was about his relationship with his family ""The Righteous Party"", how he was treated and why. Vol2. Disc 2 (MY FAVORITE IN THIS ENTIRE SERIES) was about his relationship with the other party ""The Evil (Holy) Party"", his family's enemy.This is a very good series and the actors and actresses are very good. It kept me entertained until the very end. One drawback, the English Subs. Sometimes the subs appear in less than a second or delayed that I had to scan back to figure out who's line it was. There are a few grammar and spelling mistakes but barely noticeable."
5,"Smooth, sensual and uplifting.","My first experience of Marcos Valle's music has been an absolute pleasure.Wonderful arrangements, sensual and accurate vocal style and infectious rhythm make this a must have for fans of Mr Valle and all lovers of Brazillian music.Although the CD has been around since 2001, it still sounds fresh and immediate.I play it all the time."
5,Thank you,"Thanks to all the reviewers for your input. I am in my thirties, and from what the excerpt said, and what you all said... well let's just say I'll be buying the book soon ♥. I wish that book had been out 15 years ago. Maybe it's not too late for me. I've become totally burned out, but maybe it's because I just haven't been looking at things the right way :) Good luck to all the newbies entering the world of business. It can be wonderful at times. Maybe this book will make it great a lot more often. I hope no one ever has to go through what I have. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
5,Amazing,"Wow, where did these ladies come from? If you are an aspiring woman in the workplace, you better read this book."
5,Great movie!,Can't beat the combo of Tommy Lee Jones and cheer leaders! Very funny movie with lots of great one liners.
4,"Lighten up, everyone! Tommy Lee did!","Okay, it's not Shakespeare. It's not brilliant cinema. And I didn't see it for the cheerleading babes (I don't do cheerleading babes). I do do Tommy Lee Jones (okay, I admit it-- I have a real thing for Tommy Lee Jones). And, while he's primarily a dramatic actor, and has done lots of heavy roles and thriller/adventure stuff-- in which he shines, usually above the material--- I think he's just a hoot and a half in the comedies he's done. I can watch MIB and MIIB over and over. And even if this movie is feather-light, Tommy Lee delivers his deadpan straight lines in such a way that you can't help but getting a kick out of it. The editorial reviews really nailed it: yes, it's predictable, yes it's fluff--- but it's good and fun predictable fluff. If you liked Mr. Jones in the the Men In Black films, you'll like him in this too. He certainly seemed to have fun doing it. No reason for you not to have fun watching it. I did."
3,Nice cool and fun movie,"What this movie lacks in consistency of plot, it makes up in humor. The story deals with Tommy Lee Jones protecting his witnesses of a murder from the bad guys, just that these witnesses are cheerleaders! So Jones is in his element as the unemotional and super-stiff cop, in charge of a bunch of bubbly teenagers. A slightly sad part about this movie is that it touches some interesting themes and characters, but does little in completely realising the potential of these characters or the complexity of their interplay. But there are loads of situations where there is wonderful humor, accentuated by the contrasting cast!The plot has several holes and honestly is not really gripping, with too many side threads grabbing attention, but then this is one movie to be seen with an open mind and with the intent of enjoying the light hearted comedy that it is! Definitely watchable."
5,Funny!!,"A great movie filled with action, drama and lots of laughs! Van exploding, kick-ass Texas cheerleaders and a Texas Ranger...oh what fun!!"
2,Lame Movie,This movie is just a series of stupid scenes that are thinly tied together with a dumb story line.Don't waste your time on this one.What was Tommy Lee thinking when he took this role?
1,*Groan*,"What was Tommy Lee thinking? This was probably one of the most awful things I've sat through in a while. And only because it was on TV and there was nothing to watch. It was just terribly stupid from beginning to end, completely full of every cliché you can think of. It was NOT funny, you can't even call this a mystery since we know who the bad guy is like ten minutes into the film. What is the point??"
3,Very Funny,"Not one of Tommy Lee Jones best movies but very watchable and has an excellent ending. It's very funny to see him in a comedy as he as so often done serious movies, but he easily does the genre. If you get the chance you should see this one."
3,Good not great!,"Having been a student at the University of Texas some years ago, I was more interested in how students would be portrayed in this film.The ""UT cheerleaders"" were made to look as if they were inept and stupid. Their parts in the film reminded me of those ""blond"" jokes.The movie is supposed to be a comedy. It did have some funny moments. I enjoy watchng Tommy Lee Jones in any genre of movie though. He is a very good actor. It was great to see him wearing a ""TEXAS"" shirt. Go Horns!!!The Longhorn Band was great to listen to as well even though their appearance was brief.Over-all, this movie gets a ""C"""
2,Highly Recommended For Anyone Living Under A Rock,"A few stars, cheerleaders, comedy and romance seems an inevitable combination for success, right? Uh...no. Man of the House miserably fails to appeal to its target audience.The acting by the cheerleaders is lame. There is room for plot development, but only a shallow attempt is made. What more could go wrong?The story is very slow moving. The background plot of the murder seems irrelevant really. Most of us are watching it for the cute cheerleaders. But instead, we are given stupid girls with no personality. Heck, even sterotypes fail us! We want to laugh at the combination of an uptight ranger and adolescent girls, but Man of the House fails to deliver, yet again.Basically, a no go with me. However, if you live under a rock and are completely oblivious to the world around you, you may find this funny and slightly enjoyable. For the rest of us, stick to the classics like Bring It On."
5,"Mr. Skin please add this to your website, pleeease","This was an excellent portrayl of a middle-aged man's flashbacks and longing for his first love. I am sure that this premise is quite unique for the tangibles he encounters makes him remember that sheer passion he experienced with his first love. Although one has numerous relationships over the course of a lifetime, it is the first one that had a thrilling uniqueness, the kind that sends butterflies in your stomach. There is an abundance of passionate sex and tasteful nudity, which in the case of this film, enhances it."
5,She needs to be in the spotlight!,"I happened to watch this weird but very cool horror movie online and during a particular scene a clip of this song ""Flow"" was playing and it caught my attention. It was so eerie and beautiful I just had to find it online. It was very difficult as there is no information anywhere until I found that someone else had the same idea and found it for me. It seems the album it is only available as mp3. I immediately bough it and I am more than impressed with this artist! Hope she does some more!!!"
5,If you like Dido....,"....If you like Dido then you'll love Halima's Beneath the Sun. Very similar style, very well done throughout on Beneath the Sun."
3,Mujeres (women) is not from this world,"Silvio Rodríguez does not belong to this world. Someone with such a talent for touching the most intimate fibres of your heart, turn your life upside down, make you cry, laugh, despair, rage, love and hate does not belong to this world... or this life. ""Mujeres"" is one of the best examples of this. Unfortunately only good Spanish speakers will appreciate the poetry in the lyrics. Others may enjoy the music, anyway. I can't find words to praise this work enough."
4,"Deberian producir un disco con ""Lo mejor de Silvio"".","Magnifica la muestra de canciones de Silvio Rodriguez. Pero no encontre en su lista ningun CD con una seleccion de lo mejor de Silvio. Seria un gran exito comercial para el y para ustedes... y sus admiradores con poco dinero para comprar se lo agradeceriamos muchisimo. Aqui en Mexico hace ya 20 agnos edite en forma particular un ""collage"" de Silvio, entresacando partes de canciones provenientes de mas de 30 audiocassettes propiedad de parientes y amigos. Resulto tan bueno que no tarde en prestarlo... y perderlo. Ahora ya no podria reunir de nuevo tantas canciones para hacer otra muestra como aquella. Por eso les sugiero que ustedes lo hagan. Seria un gran exito! Atentamente, Abel."
3,Low cal tea?,"When I buy a sugar free item, I expect it to be low calorie. This tea is 110 Calories per serving, 2g fat, 2g saturated fat, 21g carbohydrate, and has 4g of sugar from lactose milk sugar. This is all the ingredients I am not allowed. All the seller needs to do to avoid an unhappy customer is to show the nutrition facts of the product. I never would have purchased this product if I had seen the nutritional facts. Maybe that is why they do not show those facts. The tea is very good. A lot of high cal and fat products are very good to the taste, but poison to the system of a person with medical problems on a restricted diet. I gave the tea to my size 2 young daughter. She loves it and has no need to restrict her sugar and fats. I will stay away from this seller's products."
4,Taste great but very expensive!,"It might be cheaper than going to a Starbucks but still expensive. Too bad for me, its delicious!! I tried to limit myself to 3 cups a week. Its hard. The ""No sugar added"" still taste great. I just hoped the price is more ""reasonable""."
3,"Soothing, flavorful beverage","Although it does contain just over 100 calories in a cup, it makes a good substitute for a sugar free snack of equal calories, and is a warming welcome in winter"
3,The murderer is overly obvious,"Ellery is in Hollywood for the first time in this mystery and assumes an identity as a reporter named Hillary King in order to investigate the murder of a well hated millionaire who's bilked a number of people ruining them. The humorous writing style is top notch and Ellery's deductions as usual are spot on, but the fact that any experienced mystery reader will spot the murderer early on is disappointing and the explanation seemed overly contrived; therefore I rate this as average, or typical run-of-the-mill."
4,"Quick read, kind of tricky","I had to have this book for my bases of speech class and I enjoyed that it was a short read. I've never read an entire textbook, but I read all of this one. The terms are technical and chapters 2 and 3 were a little difficult to mull through, but I made it! It's easy to outline which I had to do to help me understand the concepts a little better."
5,Great guitar for little money,This is a serious guitar for little money. I actually prefer it to my Gibson LP Custom which I got 25 years ago for much more money.
5,Epiphone Les Paul Special II,"This is a great guitar. If you want a Les Paul styled guitar this is your guitar. Just be aware that just cuz it looks like a L.P. guitar does not mean that it will sound like the real thing (a Gibson L.P.) That was something I learned very quickly. Ha Ha. But all in all for the price this is a great looking, great feeling and good sounding guitar."
5,Beautiful Instrument,"I am retired and have been wanting to learn to play an acoustic and electric guitar. As I am a new learner and not an expert, I will give sensory perceptions of the guitar. To the touch, it feels excellent. To sight, it is beautiful and to hearing, the sound is superb. It is going to be enjoyable."
1,not like new,"the book i purchased was advertised as like new, however when it arrived there were pages falling out the binding was no longer attached, writing and highlighting throughout. It was in very poor condition."
4,Mere Christianity for the 21st Century,"I bought this book after reading Huston Smith'sWhy Religion Matters.I was less impressed by this book than than Why Religion Matters, but that may have just been because I read it first and it was just so spectacularly amazing.This was a more dense read. I had to read slowly, especially in part 1; parts 2 and 3 lightened up considerably.I have learned quite a bit about Christianity from this book. It is a good, level-headed report that doesn't shrink from controversy, but rather reports it even-handedly where it matters and ignores it where it doesn't.I heartily endorse it.It is Mere Christianity for the 21st century, I'd say."
4,Great choice for a paper or pure enjoyment,"I am not a history buff, or an avid reader of historical heroines, but this book changed my mind. I had to read a biography on Marie Antoinette for my AP European History class and am very glad that I choose this particular book. Not only is it interesting, but there is added information in the appendix that pertains to the French Revolution and the events after Marie's death as well as a very nice time line (which really helps if you have to write a paper on the book!!) If you dislike Marie Antoinette, this book will change your mind due to the real-life events in which she at a rather young age had to endure. So, if you feel the need to read a book on Marie Antoinetee...you definatly need to give this one a try."
3,Mildly entertaining,"Entertaing novel about star-crossed lovers who experience a vast array of events in England, America and India. The two protagnonists are charming, but not very interesting and the plot is well paced, but somewhat lacks credibility. Yet, the author's take on the Indian Rebellion of 1857 is shoddily written. He should have done more research on India during this period."
1,Disgusting; won't read her again,"Newsflash to the author: rape/coerced sex is not erotic. It is a FELONY. Does this insensitive writer think that sort of thing is OK if the woman is ""turned on""? This point of view is a slap in the face to crime victims.I picked up this book - from the library; thank goodness I didn't pay money for it - and was looking forward to Cameron's return to Toussaint, LA, the town where she's set several previous novels. It lacked the intrigue, suspense and plotting of any of her previous work. After the above-referenced disgusting scene, I skipped to the last few pages to discover the villian, who was no surprise.I'd give this zero stars if I could. Steer clear of this book if you're looking for a suspensful, sexy read. There are plenty of authors out there who know the difference between lusty and criminal, which I had never before imagined could be confusing."
3,Reasonably good headset,"I have owned other Plantronics headsets. This one is good for the price and the styling is nice. I should have bough the 214c version with the larger padded earpiece since this one does not fit as close to the ear as I would like. Also the volume level isn't as loud as the Panasonic KX-TCA60 for $8-$9.00 and the plug is a better fit. This units miniplug doesn't seem to ""click"" into place and the cord does seem to be a bit on the ""fragile"" side. I hope it lasts a while or I will go back to the Panasonic which is a ""no frills"" basic work horse headset."
1,TRUST THE RECENT REVIEWS: These now suck,"I originally purchased one of these Plantronics headsets 3 years ago. And back then, it rocked. After 3 years of daily use, the earpiece finally came loose from the headset - it still works, but it dangles unsupported, hanging by wires.I decided to replace it with a brand new version of the same headset, figuring it had passed the use test with flying colors. Like so many other people have said, they changed quality control somewhere, and these things now suck.First 2012 headset I got didn't work. The speaker was broken. Called the vendor, they sent me a replacement without even asking for me to send the broken 1 back. This says to me that this has become a disposable, crappy item.The second 2012 headset arrived in the mail and the headphone speaker worked, but the mute switch was broken. I demanded my money back, and am still looking for a better replacement of my old, broken down headset (which is still better than these new pieces of ahem)."
4,Works better than others I've tried,"Not the best of all headsets, but they are good for an inexpensive headset. I can hear and be heard (the critical point) and they work with both my regular phone and cell."
2,Expected so much more from Plantronics,"I ordered this looking for a high quality headset after trying a Panasonic set to go with my Panasonic phones. I do like that it is a little heavier made and nice adjustable mic, BUT the feedback and low volume of the thing makes it pretty unfun to use. I waited to long to return it and doubt any manufacturer cares enough to make one that actually works so I'm stuck with it for now."
1,Piece of crap,"The Plantronics headset I bought is a piece of crap. It barely works. They never said it came with a 1/32nd jack, so I had to buy a converter. The sound quality is a joke and no one can hear me at all, regardless of whether I switch the microphone mute/whatever button back and forth. No volume adjustment - no anything adjustment. Oh, the clip works great!"
1,Another lousy headset (Clarity phone),"Used with Clarity phone C4205.I attempted to use this headset on a total of two phone calls, one to a person on a cell, one to a person on a landline. Both people complained that I was breaking up and said that they couldn't hear me well. I also heard myself, and the static/noise I was producing, which breaks new ground in the annoying department and makes any phone call impossible.Clarity tells the world that any of three Plantronics (they own Clarity, or vice-versa) headsets will work with my phone, and most of their other cordless phones. No, they won't. I have tried any number of headsets with my phone and they all suck: not only others find it almost impossible to hear me, if I can hear them they sound very tinny."
2,Not overly impressed...,This works okay... there is a humming noise I hear and others hear it as well and the volume is too low. Will need to replace.
2,Headset volume is low is can not be adjusted,"I bought 3 of these headsets to replace a similar model I had from Plantronics that had died after 4 years. The model I was replacing had a volumne control on the cord - but the cord on this model did not have that feature. That ended up being a design change that made the product less usable. I tried all three of the new ones, but in each case, was uable to hear callers on my side above a whisper. People could hear me on their side, and reported the volume as plenty loud and very clear, but since I could not hear them in return, I ended up returning the head sets. I appreciated the quick trouble free refund on the purchase."
2,just OK,I dropped it once and the connector broke...its ok but not great ...and the mouth piece does not fully turn around so you can change the side you want to put it on. rest is OK
2,can't hear well,Very low volume even with volume contol on the phone turned all the way up. Can hardly hear. My old headset was better.
4,great value,worth every penny...if i had to say something was wrong it would be that the mouthpiece doesn't swivel...but for the cost you can't beat it!
4,Best one so far,"I've tried two other Plantronics corded headsets but they were primarily for a cell phone. Also a GE headset, but quality was poor on cell and cordless phone. I bought the M214C because it was designed for cordless phones. I works great. The only thing that I would consider an improvement is a better cord and hopefully replaceable. The flimsy cords are the weak spot, not the headset. Yes, I have bluetooth for cell phone, but it doesn't work on cordless phones (yet)."
3,Good except for a couple of pretty big flaws,"The reason I give this product only 3 stars is because I am getting an echo back in the earpiece when speaking. That's really too bad because I can hear people very well with it and they can hear me crystal clear as well. I'm also not sold on the comfort. The headset is just a bit too light and does not fit very tight around the head. I need this headset for work and it just doesn't cut it. For someone looking for a headset for home for occasional use, I would say it is a great headset. I will be returning mine."
4,plantronics cordless phone headset m210c,Works well with cellphones and cordless phones that have a jack for a head set very comfortable and clear sound.
4,Good value in a headset - Lasted 6 months,"Very comfortable. I like the flexible mic arm and the little switch to add some volume boost. Upon testing with three different people, two did not like the louder volume. One did not notice a difference. So I keep it on the quieter setting, which is nice, because I hear less of myself in the earpiece and therefor more of the person on the other end. I bought two other models at the same time. (Panasonic and Jensen) This Plantronics was the winner.UPDATE: 6 Months later, this thing is dead. I will buy again, but I'm a little dismayed that it only lasted half a year. People can still hear me, but I can't hear them. Must be a short somewhere."
5,Good product!,"I am very pleased with this headset. I have found that headsets are a workable answer for me due to a muscular syndrome I have, as holding a phone can cause muscle stiffness and pain for me. And this set works very well. I simply attach the plug to my cordless phone, drop it into a pocket and I can walk around the house hands free quite easily---just watch that the cord doesn't catch on cabinet handle and pull it off your head---Ha! The headset is adjustable, has excellent sound quality and apparently good voice---as I am not asked to repeat myself---and it is reasonalby price! After use, the mouthpiece simply rotates upwards and stores easily on a hook. I have no problem recommending this headset."
5,"Sounds great, price is right","Headset is a great choice for those devices with a 2.5mm jack. No need to spend a bunch of your hard earned cash on a high end headset, this baby rocks and I got it for around $12!"
2,major difficulty with volume,"Even with the volume turned up, I can't hear adequately. I usually have to press the earpiece to my ear, which defeats the purpose of a headset! If there's any noise in the room, it's even harder to hear. Since I can't hear well enough it doesn't matter that the device is comfortable and easy to put on/ take off. Its construction is a little flimsy."
1,Poor sound; not functional for business use,"The sound quality of the earphones is so poor, you will not be able to understand what people are saying unless you press the earphones hard against your ear. Also there is no volume control for the incoming sound. On the other hand, the microphone works perfectly, and others will be able to hear you just fine. There is even a volume control on the microphone, but I assume that only affects how your voice is heard to others."
1,Great mic Lousy earpiece,"I tried this on several cordless and cell phones and the result was the same. Everyone said the microphone sounded wonderful, but I could barely hear the dial tone. If any headset needed an amplifier, it's this one. The Panasonic KX-TCA60 is almost $4 cheaper, has a windscreen on the mic and is as loud or louder than the phones I tried it on."
4,Very Decent Headset 4 the Price,"I have owned many headsets for use around the house. I use them alot, so they are really put to the test for durability. This headset has proven to be the best so far. It has a good sized gauge wire that won't short out easily and the earpad is foam, but very durable and light weight and comfy. The volume in the earpiece isn't the loudest, but adequate and the microphone has excellent ""pick-up"" with a high and low switch. People can hear me very well. Also, you can wear it on either ear.The plug is a 1/8th inch."
3,Poor Sound quality,I work from home so I was looking for a headset that was both comfortable and had some good sound quality. This unit ranks ok for comfort but the sound quality is marginal at best. People that I am talking to sound distant and some voices are slightly muffled. Next time I will spend more money on a higher quality product.
1,Worst Plantronics product ever,If you are a Plantronics wireless phone user you must already know that after a year or so the headsets start giving you trouble with bad sound quality. This is due to copper cables inside the cord tend to break where it takes a curve at the spot right before the belt attachment. This one would be my second replacement as I spend most of my time on the phone with customer service. No problem with packaging whatsoever BUT the headset itself is very bulky especially the 2.5 mm jack compared to other models I previously used and sound quality is beyond terrible. Don't be fooled with its low price and go look for higher models. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!
1,Worked for about 2 months,"I ordered the Plantronics Oth headset hoping it would work great. The audio was just ok. It was hard to hear even at full volume on the phone. The microphone seemed to work pretty well. The reversible option was pretty nice. After about 7 weeks, the audio stopped working even though the microphone still works. So people can hear me, but I can't hear anything. I paid $18 for mine, expecting it to work for a long time. I took care of it, but it just plain broke. It is poorly made. Good luck!"
3,Headset,I like this headset because it is adjustable and prevents any discomfort in my neck from trying to hold a cordless phone when I need to do something with my hands quick. I would recommend this product.
5,Plantronics Cordless Phone Headset,"purchased this item from Amazon as part of my daughters Christmas presentshe was thrilled with it. She said the quality is outstandingand she can use it when others in the room are talking and theTV is on and she is on the phone. Also, she has somephysical problems and it hurts her arm to hold the phone up forlong so the headset is just what she needed."
3,Not the greatest,There isn't much of a volume control. You have to press the ear piece to your ear in order to hear. If there is any other noise in the room you can't hear your party. I should of sent it back. But I threw the box away prematurely.
2,not so sure,"all went well for a good 7 months. then all of a sudden it stopped working.not sure why, but had to buy a new one.it was a good product while it lasted..if it would have lasted, I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Should have gotten the M214C with volume control.,I accidentally ordered the M210C instead of the M214C which I've used in the past. The volume is too low for me.
3,"Adequate headset for a good price, but not the greatest audio quality","I bought this headset because of positive experiences with other Plantronics headsets. This was one of the cheapest headsets I found, so I can't complain about the price. It is functional, however the sound quality of this model has a noticeably rough quality... the sound is not as smooth or detailed as other headsets I've owned. Further, I've gotten numerous comments on calls about background noises. This mic seems very prone to picking up various types of sounds, say from outdoors or across the room, whereas most other headsets I've owned are much better at zeroing in on one's voice. As sound quality is important to me, I'm now looking to replace this with another headset."
2,can't hear,"My husband seems to go through these phone headsets about yearly. We have been buying a panasonic which has been ok, but we wanted to try the plantronics to see if it would last longer. I am sure it will, because he rarely uses it! He tried it for several days, but said he just couldn't hear the person on the other end. They could hear him ok, but he was sick of asking everyone to repeat what they said. This one isn't a good one."
3,OK - not as good as the Plantronics headset it replaced,This is replacing the headset that came standard with my Plantronics cordless phone. The original was more comfortable because it had a thicker ear foam and sturdier because it had a metal headband. The new one has ok audio quality for speaking and listening but seems more prone to picking up interference from nearby cell phones. I didn't have really high expectations since it was inexpensive and quality about in line with the cost.
2,Someone's smoking crack....,"How can anyone compare this to the likes of Trent Reznor, Beck or Prince? (Early Prince that is) Spy tries to do too many things that he does badly, over and over again, instead of just dropping it. To the reviewer that commented about Spy being like Beck after taking vocal lessons, I entirely fail to see this point, Beck proved a long time ago that he could sing, unlike Spy, who likes to ""jabber"" more than sing. If I could understand half the words to a song I'd be ecstatic. The only reason for the 2 stars is because of the single Baby, which does show some sort of creative output in Spy's mind. Too bad it didn't carry over throughout the album."
5,Best Album,"I'm not the type to throw around the words ""Best Album"" lightly. I mean it when I say it. I stumbled up this by accident and it instantly became my favorite. I love the way that it flows so well together to form a sense of a unified album. This seems especially impressive considering the wide variation among the different songs. But, there is definitely a story being played out by the melody. Do yourself the favor of sitting down, focussing, and listening to the entire album front to back. You'll be impressed. If anyone knows of similar albums, let me know."
3,Some choice cuts,"It seems as though everyone either really dislikes this album or just loves it. I'd say I'm the middle. I really love about 1/3 of the songs on the album and the rest I only find so-so. My favorite song on this album is probably either ""Stay Away"" or ""Untitled 17"". I usually listen to the first track then skip to the tenth. There is however a few good songs in the middle. I especially like the instrumental tracks.This album is a good ride but theres a few bumps here and there. I'll definately be looking into J. Ralph's future endeavors."
3,"Ehh, not bad","The first track ""One Million Miles Away"" is amazing, and was featured in a Volkswagen commercial. The rest of the CD is really kind of mediocre, going from a beautiful instrumental song (One Million Miles Away) to a fabricated sounding dance song ""Baby."" J Ralph has talent, there's no doubt about it, but I think he needs to spend more time weaving beautiful instrumentals like ""One Million Miles Away,"" and ""Untitled 17,"" (""Goonies"" isnt a bad track, either.) Overall it's a pretty decent album, but nothing to go crazy for."
1,DON'T WORRY....,"... cuz even if it's out of stock here, you should be able to find it in ANY USED CD BIN IN THE WORLD! This is truly the definition of that old phrase ""complete garbage""."
1,"did spy write all of these 5 star reviews himself, or...","... did the people at amazon? either way, someone is trying to unload a bunch of crap on you!!!! buyer beware!!!!! buy midnite vultures twice before getting this one! eeewwww..."
2,Raspberry chai isn't my cup of tea,I did not care for the raspberry chai flavor. I much prefer Big Train Vanilla ChI -- even better than Starbucks.
3,Sampled Rasberry Chai,"Tried the Rasberry Chai in the 12oz bag, did not like it as well as the Vanilla Chai or Spiced Chai from Big Train. The 1 pound can of the Rasberry flavor would be too large of a quantity to use just for variety when drinking Chai tea."
2,Copy of an old recording,"I liked most of the songs, but I thought the sound quality was poor. It was probably just a recording of an old version."
4,Not the best song...,An average song on an amazing album. And what the heck is up with the heinous album artwork????? What were they thinking? Are they trying to put us off buying it?
1,A cheap piece of junk,"I bought this thing and it worked great for about three months. Yeah it sounds nice and all that but now it doesn't power up at all. I tried just the batteries-nothing. I tried the power cord-still nothing. I tried taking it back to Target, nothing. Altec Lansing Customer Service wasn't helpful. In the trash it went after I took a baseball bat to it. I need something that works and this did for awhile but it was manufactured horribly and is cheap plastic. I went with JBL and am very satisfied with that."
2,unsatisfied,"I have had several problems with this product. I listen to music while I sleep and if i ever get a text or a call on my cell phone regardless of the cell phone being on silent, the player picks up the frequency of the call and an extremely loud static noise comes from the speakers about five times louder then how the music is playing. The remote hardly works, it has to be almost directly in line with the receiver. The volume control is limited, the intervals at which it is controlled are large so the desired volume affect is difficult to attain if you want it playing extremely quiet. When it is playing loud also a slight buzz is heard. The springs that allow the player to become portable also wear out quickly so the player doesn't stand up after awhile without u holding it. The only reason i would ever recommend this is because it is cheaper then many other players. If you are looking for anything half decent, then this is the wrong one."
3,inMotion vs. Bose - no comparison,"My husband and I have an iPod and a Nano and like to listen to music throughout the house. We already have a Bose Sound Dock in our living room (which we LOVE). We thought that we'd opt for a smaller unit for the kitchen/deck. For folks who think these speakers remotely compare to the sound of Bose, you clearly don't have the Bose Sound Dock. If you are looking for sound that will fill your house, go Bose - hands down.The inMotion system is fine for the deck, an office, bedroom, smaller spaces like that where you won't need volume. inMotion is not made for quality volume. It sounds tinny if you crank up the volume.We're moderately happy with the inMotion's system..."
3,Sound is okay but not great,"I was dissappointed with the sound on this -- it comes out very tinny. I don't know if other portable speakers have a similar problem. But it is convenient to have an extra speaker that is easy to carry around. I use it with my laptop for presentations, and is okay for watching movies on a computer. But I would not buy this if the primary purpose is to listen to music."
2,Everything is great EXCEPT...,"I am a massage therapist and bought this little sound system for my office to use during sessions. The sound is fine, everything is fine EXCEPT! When my iPod transitions from track to track, the speakers pop when one track ends and another begins. It's a small thing, but an extremely annoying one that happens several times during a session. It doesn't happen on any other sound system I've tried, so I was surprised and disappointed when I noticed it happening on this one.Now I've got to go get another system and I'm going to buy it in-store somewhere so I don't run into this problem again."
5,best for travel!,"I purchased this unit to travel with, so I wanted something compact and lightweight. This is it! I looked for a long time at this unit, the Logitech MM50 and the Tivoli Audio iSongbook and finally decided on this one because it will fit into almost any carry-on luggage, it comes with several different plugs for outlets all over the world, is lighter in weight, and will take regular batteries. Yes, I know the MM50s and iSongbook probably have better stereo separation, but I'm not looking to try to duplicate my home listening experience with Magnepan speakers. I liked the iSongbook, but finally decided it was too bulky for travel and too burdensome for use in a rental car that didn't have an MP3 jack. This unit's compactness and light weight (15 ounces) finally tipped the scales in its favor. Besides, it's two hundred dollars cheaper than the iSongbook. Love it! Sounds great and works just fine with my 80GB iPod!"
4,doula lady,I use this with my work. I'm in labor & delivery and the Mother's love the quiet music I play. The portability is great and I love the remote. I can be in another part of the room and if need I can adjust sound and song easily. Would I purchase this again? YES
1,Did not work-avoid this product,"The iM3c was a gift - looked like a great little portable stereo for my Pod. First used it on a trip. Started off playing ok and then the sound cut in and out. Frustrated me for the week as I didn't know if it would play or not on any given day. When it did play it was ok but not great. Finally, it didn't play anymore.Returned it to the Apple Store where purchased to find that there was only a 15 day return policy and I missed it by 2 days. So, I tried to contact Altec Lansing. The phone number in the owners book didn't work although I tried for several days. Then I emailed the Altec support email. No response after two emails.Sometimes a product doesn't work and it's easy to return or get repaired. On this one, it looks like this product will be finding the trash can.Do not buy."
5,great iPod Speakers,The Altec Lansing InMotion IMC3 Portable Audio System for iPod Photo is a great buy. The sound quality for such a small unit is remarkable.
1,They sent me the wrong item!,"this is the 2nd item in a row that amazon has shipped the wrong thing over. Instead of getting the Lansing Altec speakers, I recieved some cheap knock off that has terrible static. Amazon banks on the fact that you wont pay for return shipping. I am very unhappy with my purchase and doubt I would waste my money on anything else from Amazon ever again."
4,Great portable speakers,"Ever since I purchased the IM3, time and time again I have been pleasantly surprised by the sound coming from these tiny speakers. They don't sound tiny at all. I have an HP 17inch laptop. The sound coming from the IM3 is leagues better than my laptop's built in speakers.Of course you have to keep everything in perspective. These are portable speakers, you can't compare them to desktop systems that come with larger woofers and a sub. The IM3 make great portable speakers I can take anywhere."
4,Just What I Needed,"I was looking for a decent sounding, reasonably priced, speaker system for use on my night stand and while traveling.The IM3C has exceeded all my expectations. In it's travel bag, with AC Adaptor it takes up less room than a hardback book. The 110-240 power supply comes complete with all the adaptors I need to plug it in in Germany, Korea, and Japan (I travel often, so this is handy). Better yet, it charges the iPod, so I don't have to carry the iPod charger.The sound isn't Bose good...but it's comparable with a good boom box. I've heard complaints about lack or volume and lack of bass. I listen to folk, country, and classic rock and the bass is clean and true. As far as volume, it won't power a frat party, but it's just fine in a hotel room.This is the perfect system for the frequent traveler."
5,Smart Product,"I have a Bose system for my office but I bought the IM3C for traveling . Great sound , very light , universal power adapters,carry bag, remote .All around smart product ."
3,Shorted out / can't be fixed,"Speakers worked well for a while, and I didn't use them every day, however they shorted out one day from static electricity and haven't worked since. I called Altec Lansing and they said that they are made to be replaced, not repaired."
4,Pleased Teenager!,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 15 years old son and he thinks it's Awesome! We used it while away camping over the New Year and it worked brilliantly.We also used it as an outlet speaker for our portable DVD player so we didn't have to wear earphones - awesome. Would recommend it to anyone.One very slight problem - the Ipod doesn't fit EXACTLY snug so he puts his soft protector behind it and that works fine. This is a plus for me as it means he doesn't loose the protector too! LOL
5,Great product,"These speakers are great!MUCH less expensive than Bose and really almost just as good. Best yet it folds up so you can take it along with you on vacation, etc. and never be without all your favorite music!I highly recommend!"
2,Not so hot.,"Sound - okay, nothing to brag about, kind of tinny, but I didn't expect much. The remote wouldn't track forward or back. I was still intrigued, but what broke the deal was when I removed my nano ipod from the dock - it went blank and I had to restore it. A little unsettling. Made me leary of using it again, but I did (positive thinking) and the same thing happened. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... It's going back and I'll try the Sonic dock/speakers instead."
4,Altec Lansing Audio System I-Pod,"We are very pleased with the speakers good sound reproduction.Excellent for travel,I can listen to my music anywhere."
4,IM3C,"The audio system is a nice addition for my ipod. Sound is good, traveling case could be a little bit bigger."
2,Not powerful,It is ok but certainly not for a real music lover. It is not very powerful and distorts bass.
4,I'm a satisfied customer.,"I am happy with my purchase. I only bought it because I don't like the idea of going deaf listening to loud music through earphones. I would not use this product to entertain at a party, but it serves my needs."
2,Brutal,"Big disappointment. The sound only sounds good if you are standing right in front of it. There is almost no bass. While it is portable, the only real use I can see is sitting it on a bedside table."
5,The Best of its Kind-a Great Memoir!,"I've probably read every book on animation written in english-both in and out of print; Shamus Culhane's book, while an autobiography, is also a detailed insider's view of what it was really like to work in animation's ""golden age"". And word for word, as a history-it's the best of them all. Culhane spares no one(least of all himself)in his funny, always passionate-and often downright angry-stories of his career which went from New York in the early 'thirties, to depression Los Angeles and the fabled Disney studio, pre-""Snow White"", to Fleisher, Warner Bros., Lantz, and finally running his own small studio. A cracking good read!"
5,Not just for animators... it's the web!,"This book was recommended to me by another web/multimedia developer. He told me that I should read it, that it was the web industry in a nutshell. The main difference is the web has a very compressed time line. I first read the book over a year ago... it still reads like prophesy."
5,FANTASTIC PIANIST!,ROGER WILLIAMS IS ONE OF THE BEST PIANO PLAYERS EVER. THE CD IS A FABULOUS EXAMPLE! GOOD PRICE AND FAST DELIVERY! PERFECT CONDITION!
2,not as pictured,"I didn't have high expectations for the price, but this costume is REALLY cheap looking. It is different from what is pictured on the site and the packaging it arrived in. Instead of a shirt and black pants, it is a one-piece tan jumpsuit with a sash - goofy. Was told by seller that manufacturer must have changed the design?? To say the fabric is flimsy would be generous. Yoda mask was squashed out of shape. Unfortunately, it arrived so late from seller, I can only make the best of it."
4,"From the American System to Mass Production, 1800-1932; The Development of Manufacturing Technology in the U.S.",Super book
5,A Sober Perspective,"Having been in many parts of the world which O'Rourke describes, I find his conclusions very accurate and worthy of reading over and over. He has been to these places, participated in their activities, and spoken to individuals from opposing sides. He is funny (though sometimes too vulgar for some people's taste) and his humor is not bitter. Though the reader may be unfamiliar with some of the names of people and events in history O'Rourke uses to illustrate things, the author is still able to make his points. His writing style with rich vocabulary is refreshing in a time when political writings read like children's essays. Overall, a very educational read."
5,"War, while ultimately stupid, is very serious.","I laughed out loud at so many parts of this book. P.J.'s description of the ""Sandalistas"" from The U.S. Helping the communists of Nicaragua when Chamorro won was hilarious and skewering of those that think the United States is the focus of evil in the world. I really loved his description of the Kuwaiti""freedom fighters"" that werelooking for Iraqis, Iraqi sympathisers and the Algebrs teacher that gave too many pop quizzes. War is too important to be left to the Generals, but it is also too important to be left only to the politicians."
1,Incredibly disappointing follow-up to 'Evergreen',"I have been listening to Echo and the Bunnymen since 1981 and was pleased when they reformed a few years ago. I loved ""Evergreen,"" the comeback CD, but this new one, I'm sad to say, is a turkey--slow, wimpy and boring. It reminds me of the horrid Ian McCulloch solo efforts of the mid-80s. It has been a long, strange trip for Echo and the Bunnymen. Maybe it's time to call it a day. In the meantime, I've still got ""Heaven Up Here"" and lots of good memories."
5,Glorious popsongs on a masterpiece - what a rush!,"Brilliant album with a great romantic, acoustic feel. Recommended. Songs that will last forever."
2,I dunno...,"I thought Evergreen was a bit too...mellow, but compared to this, it sounds like Porcupine. EatB mark II has been rather disappointing to me (although I do rather enjoy Candleland and Mysterio). Anyway, while I suppose WAYGTDWYY? has some songs that are decent enough, it's not spectacular. When people compare this and/or Evergreen to Ocean Rain, they seem to forget that OR was hardly a soft-rocking album, what with frenzied numbers like Thorn of Crowns and Silver--and when it wasn't rocking full-out, it had a great dark, brooding vibe to it that WAYGTD decidedly lacks. I mean, come on--we all became B-Men fans because of numbers like Villiers Terrace, Stars are Stars, and Happy Death Men, didn't we? This isn't even close, although it does increase my appreciation of Evergreen. You said I was just a touch away...but I'm not even close...no I'm nowhere near. A good summation of this album, that."
1,"INSOMNIA? Well, listen to this!","I have been a dedicated Bunnymen fan for many years. My friends used to make fun of me because of it(what do they know?). I absolutely love everything up to and including Echo's 1987 self-titled album. Evergreen was ok (love Altamont), but if I'm asked to describe What Are You Going To Do With Your Life?, only 3 words come to mind: BIG 'OLE SNOOZE!!!!!! Forget about Unisom, or any other over-the-counter sleep aid. Just give a listen to this album. I like Rust and Get In The Car, but other than that, ZZzzzzz..............! The other two tracks on the CD single ""Rust"" were pretty good. This album was just too mellow. They should have tried balancing it out with a few classic Bunnymen sounds. It's worth buying anyway. I guess you can always use it for medicinal purposes!"
2,Fairly un-inspiring stuff,"What are you doing with your life, indeed? Not much by the sound of things here. If you liked the syrup-y sounds of Candleland, this is for you. But, if you burned with Electrafixion, and felt re-juvenated by Evergreen, this one will fail to satisfy. Mac needs to take a trip back up to Villier's Terrace...just to see what's happenin' there. Seems he's forgotten."
1,Very disappointing effort,"I have been a Bunnymen fan for a number of years and eagerly await any new material they release. This album, however, was a total let down. As other's have commented, this is a very mellow album. That, by itself, is not bad. The trouble is the songs and lyrics are very lame and unimaginative. Not anywhere near the quality we have come to expect from this band. I read comments about this being a ""mature"" album. Since when does being ""mature"" mean being bland and boring?"
1,short and simple...,"It is trash.The horns and strings ARE muzak. This is NOT the Echo and the Bunnymen *I* grew up with in the 80's. This is NOT swirling music like the current of a river unless it's a polluted and slow moving sewer. Ian's voice HAS mellowed and so have his lyrics (boooring), melodic ideas, and the rhythm of these -um- songs(?) is so regular it could send oyu to sleep.These are not old friends, they are lost geezers who need to get whiny and angry again.<shaking head> I wasted [money] on this stuff!"
4,80s-style Britpop,"If you like pleasant 80s-style Britpop, this one will not disappoint you. The songs are beautiful and memorable. What makes me a bit suspicious is that the third time I listened to it I had the feeling I had known these songs for years. Maybe they lack a tiny little bit of something which one may dislike at first but which makes them different from other songs."
4,Echoes from the Bunnymen,"Not quite the Bunnymen masterpiece but surely a great album. The return of this great 80's gothic English band shows still some geniality in songs like the title track ""What are you going to do with your life?"", ""History Chimes"" and ""Rust"", undoubtibly the best track on the cd. Another highlite is the poetry displayed in the lyrics. Maybee with the exeption of The Cure, this is the best band that joins lyric poetry perfectlly with wonderfully played instruments. Once again, not a masterpiece but surelly worth the price. Ian McCulloch's voice has never sounded better, not to mention great captivating guitar riffs."
4,Strong re-emergence from an eclectic band,"I'm sure I've heard other Echo & The Bunnymen songs from the eighties, but I can't recall any of them, making this band a new discovery for me. The medium tempo of the songs make it a great road trip CD, and Ian McCulloch's voice sounds at times like Bono from U2, and at others like Glen Phillips from Toad the Wet Sprocket. My only complaint about this CD, although all of the songs have merit, a lot of them share the same sound which isn't tiresome, but unchallenging. Tracks 1-3 start out the CD strongly, and tracks 7-9 bookend that strength. It's the middle three that fail to challenge the listener. Overall, a good CD which is instantly likeable."
1,Echo and the Bunnymen Graduate to MUZAK,"This album was a great disappointment to me. After there last outing (Evergreen) I assumed that they would return to a more progressive/pop sound. Unfortunately this was not the case. They should have never reformed, what should have been there last album the Self Titled Echo... was by far there greatest achievement and a far cry from anything that they have done Since. Ian should have stayed with Electrafixion. And the Bunny men should have called it a day!"
5,My Favorite Album - Period,"I've been a fan of Echo since I was thirteen, frankly, a long time ago now. I've grown up and Echo and the Bunnymen have to. This album is a celebration of that. Ian's vocals are rich with life in this recording and the lyrics are more meaningful than any I have ever read from any musical artist. If you want to dance look elsewhere - if you want to really reflect on life and revel in it's beauty get this album and be prepared for some great songs - they will not disappoint!"
1,"Older doesn't mean dead, or does it ?","I've been a Bunnymen fan since the early 80's, am a couple of years younger than Mac, but nowhere near as dead.It's fine to move on and not live in the past, it's fine to be reflective, but this album sounds as if Ian is on death's doorstep.If you like downbeat almost Burt-Bacharach-ish schmaltzy ballads, this album is for you.Pick up the pace Ian, surely you have SOME spark left ??"
1,Pure Junk,"A total waste of money. You can't hear the bell even if you have it clipped to your body, the vibration feature didn't work and the timer has a mind of its own. I smashed it with a pipe wrench and felt good afterwards."
1,NEVER RECEIVED ITEM AND NO RESPONSE FROM SELLER,"I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing products from this seller! I ordered this product Nov. 5, 2009, and as of today, December 12, 2009 I still haven't received the product. After a few weeks of not receiving the product, even though I got an email confirmation from Amazon that the product had been shipped to me soon after I purchased it, I tried to contact the seller to find out the status of the order and to find out why it hadn't arrived. But I never received a response from the seller. I'm glad the product wasn't too expensive, but it is still a waste of my money and a complete disregard of customer service by the seller. Buyers beware!"
5,Nmotzr cheap best of the year,Nmotzr best of the year is cheap cider me terribly training improves meter time relaxing rounds I personally was very pleased with the product Onilob
4,Six months later...,...It still works fine. I use this 2-3 times a week. My only neg with this is I wish it had a 5min mode.
3,Serves it's purpose,This ring bell timer serves it's purpose. Only drawback is that when I'm hitting the speed bag I cannot hear bell go off. It's a little low. You can attach it to yourself and it will buzz but I do not like to do that. Otherwise a good product.
2,Cough up some more cash!,"This product was spot on what I was looking for. However there are far too many glitches, and I'm still trying to figure out how a company screws up a timer. I threw out the strap from the get go, and as if I clipped it onto my shorts it would flop off.The screen can be hard to read but not impossible, the ""bell"" is not bad but could be louder. Mine worked fine in the beginning but now frequently miss counts rounds,re-sets it self, and freezes! Its a pain when doing heavy bag work since I need to take my gloves of to re-set everything. For the most part I put up with it as I am a broke college student and somethings better then nothing.SO NO EVERLAST THIS IS NOT A SMEAR CAMPAIGN!"
1,I've gone through two in two!!!!,"So I began boxing intensely in the last few months, and few of the older boxers told me about this timer; thing is, the timer is not for intense filled work outs. If you are calm about your stuff and take it easy then get it - I must say that I did drop it a few times. Perhaps it's not that bad when I think about it; however, my rating is due to my experience."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this one because I figured if it broke I'm not out much money, I figured I might get lucky but I didn't. Sure enough the other reviews are correct, it is very cheap and very porely built. The batteries don't fit in well and the cover to them is tough to keep on. It worked for about 8 work outs and then it just went nuts and even by adjusting the batteries it won't work right. Save the 10 bucks and buy something different. This is a terrible product. I can only imagine how many of these end up in the local land fill within a month of purchase."
2,"good enough, while it lasts!","Bought one at Dick's Sporting Goods...did not work right out of the box.Replaced it without fuss by Dick's....worked just fine for 10-20 times.Without any misuse whatsoever, it suddenly stopped working altogether.This is my second negative review of Everlast products on Amazon.com The fingerless heavy bag gloves i bought at Sports Authority were of such poor durability and workmanship they should come with a warning ""for display only, not to be used for punching.""Everlast is a shadow of its former self, and I for one will never again purchase an Everlast product. This is a company on the way out.The Everlast of today is a disgrace to the brand, and to the boxing tradition with which it is associated."
1,Waste of money,It's really easy to use but it's got a really annoying sound. You can't customize it at all. For what it costs this thing is a complete ripoff. It should only cost about 7 or 8 bucks.
1,crap,"Its embarassing that such a respected boxing company would put out something like this...I dig the ringer, great ring but it only lasted for a couple weeks, the battery case must have been put together by gremlins because its just not designed to hold batteries, doesnt even close...all I can say is...what the hell? go see GYMBOSS instead"
1,Junk - Waste of money,"I wish I could give this a zero, but that isn't allowed. This item broke before my first workout was over. Contrary to what other reviews are saying my bell was too loud, & te vibrater would continue for 30 seconds which I found distracting. But as I said earlier, it quite working before I was done working out."
4,good enough,"nice help if you train by yourself but i would prefer a timer that let you program the rounds time, it works anyway"
5,very nice piece of equipment,this is very solidly build. good quality. durable too. dropped a few times and it keeps going. plastic construction but solid. love the timer!
1,Great idea...poor execution!!!,"I boxed amateur for a few years, and still do the workout now and again. When I saw this, I thought ""What a great idea!!!"". Only problem is - they cheaped out on the production (Typical Everlast). It is really poorly made and poorly thought out. Too low a tone to hear when you are shadow boxing, let alone hitting a bag. All the tones are the same, so you can't distinguish where you are in the workout - could use a 30 second tone as well. Buy yourself a stop-watch instead..."
2,A Total Waste of Money!,"This worked for about three workouts then it fell apart. The back fell off and the batteries fell out, so I figured I could just use tape to keep the batteries in...no way. If the batteries fit in tight, that would have solved the problem, but they didn't. They were loose. A total waste of money. I'm am now on the hunt for a timer that actually works!"
3,Good Enough For the Price,"This rather inexpensive clock works well. It would be great if it had a few more interval options (e.g., 30 sec, 1 min). Otherwise fine for 2 minute rounds."
3,Round 1,"I was expecting a little more from this purchase since Everlast has been in this business for a little while. The trend I have seen with Everlast products over the years is that it is less about quality and more about the name. Given, this isn't a really expensive item but it was already starting to show signs of wear after two weeks in my gym bag. I was also disppointed that there wasn't a thirty-second warning built into the product. It still works even though the fake bell sound it makes is warpped and there are pieces that have come loss inside of it. You really get what you pay for with this product."
5,Brilliant and motivating!,"This is a nice inexpensive alternative to a gym timer. Use it for jumping rope, hitting the bag, etc. Also great for Tabata Protocol workouts. Google that to learn about it.Nice and inexpensive and has a real bell sampled sound. Great!"
1,Poor Quality. Save your money.,"As a loyal Everlast customer I was very disappointed when my timer developed glitches after just a few uses. The bell stopped working, settings would change on their own and then it just stopped working.I have been using a Gymboss timer for a few months now and it is more versatile and better quality for about the same price. Get one of those and save yourself the aggravation."
4,Everlast Personal Round Timer,"It works great; however, the bell ringer is WAY TOO soft. It's very hard to hear when working out in the gym. Other than that, it's a pretty cool timer."
4,Works Fine for Me,"I've used this timer on-and-off for about a year, and I'm surprised about all the negative reviews. It works just fine for my purposes.The timer is simple but does what it's supposed to - time rounds. It hasn't broken even after being dropped a coupled of times. And I haven't had to change the batteries ever.This timer is a big help in my personal bag-training workout because without it I wouldn't know when a round ends. It's probably not loud enough for doing more than personal bag work, but it works great for that.The reason it only gets 4 stars is that due to its small size it's hard to hit the on/off button while wearing gloves, so pausing can be difficult."
1,Just Plain Bad Engineering,"As soon as I received my Timer and began checking it out, I realized right away just how poorly this thing was made. The ""Rest"" feature, the setting to determine how long you have to rest between rounds, has two options, 30 or 60 seconds. Mine only allows 60 seconds, regardless of which position the setting is actually on.I truly expected much better from Everlast. I've been kickboxing for years and I have many of their products with nothing bad to say about anything else they've put their name on.For someone who does most of his workouts at home on my own heavy and speed bags & jump rope, etc, this timer is all I thought I would need.Very disappointed."
4,Pretty good,"This is a basic yet functional timer.PROS*Flick of a switch for 2 or 3min rounds and 30 to 1 min rests. Really quick and simple way of setting number of rounds and duration*Has a warning bell before the end of the round.*I'd stay its pretty sturdy as i've dropped it a few times/stored it in the bottom of my bag and after 6 months of abuse and mishandling it's still ringing. Battery life seems good as well.CONS*The bell is pretty loud but is often drowned out by background noise during heavy work outs (ie blaring music, people screaming-haha) so for personal use you have to clip it on ur person with vibrate mode. Sadly the clip becomes easily dislodged and the arm strap gets in the way. This is no design fault just basic practicality. Not really a con as such but worth a mention.All in all its a good, basic, portable backup timer that's easy and fast to use and is decent value for money."
1,poor quality,"The thing never worked, right out of the package. It counts down alright, but the buzzer and vibrator do not work at all. Junk, dont waste your money."
2,Poor Quality for Everlast,"My timer lasted longer than some reviewers' have, but the clip broke, the battery cover broke, and it then it stopped ringing at all. It's disappointing from Everlast, which has such great gloves and other products."
1,Coulda been great...,"But they skipped out on actual product value. Problem with battery fitment as others stated. Loose internal parts rattle like marbles rolling around inside.It's sad, everlast turned an outstanding concept into a crappy product.Everlast lives up to it's reputation as the bottom of the barrel of boxing products, yet again."
4,Pretty good for the price.,I've been using this for about 9 month now and it is not a bad timer for the price. Its easy to use and does what it suppose to do. It is a little quiet but i can still hear it every time.
4,men of science,Very interesting. Learned about a lot of people I never really knew about. If you are interested in science this is a wonderful read.
2,For the die hard science lover,"Great to learn more about pioneers of science, but really tough reading. Great bedtime reading unless ones interest lies with some of the scientists."
4,Basic Mandarin Chinese,"Since I am planning a trip to Beiing, China for the summer Olympics in 2008, I was looking for a book that would simplify the emergency and polite words of the Chinese language. This book will allow me to honor the people of China by showing respect for their language and their culture."
4,Perfume Bottles,A great book to have on hand as reference. Dimensions of the bottles would have been an advantage.
4,Quick and easy to install.,"I put the extra large mail box on this post and it's very sturdy. If I were to do it again, I would buy or make a longer wooden stake (2x4). I also added a couple of screws because my bax is heavy. I'm very happy with the post and especially how it looks on the curb."
4,Great above the ground....,"...but the 'stake' that came with it wasn't working to support the mailbox in our heavy soil. I would recommend having a bag of cement on hand for installation. What I ended up doing was using my old mail boxes wooden post, cut down to size, and inserted inside the new mailboxes plastic post. Worked great! The post looks excellent once installed, and is very easy to clean! I'm very happy to not have to repaint my white mailbox and post every year anymore."
4,"Playful, pensive or mourning, Kelley Deal is a star in her own right...","This debut for Breeder Kelley Deal's sideband is full of wicked riffs, canny writing, beautifully reedy, husky vocals, and pop-rock hooks that show a playfulness of spirit and yet don't lean completely to a commercially-driven musical side. This CD is pure 1996, in all its alt-rock glory, sounding much like The Breeders at their best. ""Canyon"" kicks it off with wonderful percussion, ""How About Hero"" is wonderfully rambunctious, and the rocking ""Dammit"" (soft...soft, then LOUD) is affecting and amusing at once. My favorite track is the just-under-two-minute ""Tick Tock"", which has a catchy, fuzzed-out bubblegum flavor wrung through distorted guitars and vocals. In other words, it's glorious."
3,Dog in Action,"I couldn't finish it...it wasn't that is wasn't good! I think there is a lot of great information in there somewhere! It was difficult to read! I am a reader! I read a lot! it was the terminology, I think it was written a long time ago, and it read that way, and he used lots of show terms, old ones...I am not a show dog person, just a vet tech, massage therapist and a Reiki practitioner...so there it is...NOT a quick easy read. :) thanks~"
4,Wonderful read for the serious breeder and exhibitor.,"This book is a product of the era in which it was written and carries some surprising (and a little offensive) stereotypes in the anecdotes the begin most chapters. Assuming you can overlook that, this is the best book contains the best explanations of how how structure effects function in the canine I have ever read - and I've read just about everything out there. This is a must for the serious breeder and conformation exhibitor."
3,Not Required Reading,"This is a difficult book to get through. The author tries to compensate for that fact by starting out with some ""stories"" of his own, but it can't make up for the difficult reading ahead of you. You're going to need a dictionary to read this and don't read it when you're bored, you'll fall asleep!The structure information is good, it's just not an easy read."
3,"Interesting idea, but too crude","Ok, I won't say this is a bad movie.It's quite of a critic to life. I mean, how we can try to life protected and away of the world and reality, but real life always finds a way to come in.Still, I found the movie too slow, too crude sometimes."
2,"Fascinating, weird, unpleasant","I wanted to see this because I had read some good reviews about it and after all, it was nominated for Best Foreign Film. A fascinating premise, it follows the lives of a father and mother and their three teenage children who have been completely sheltered from the outside world. The children, who act like emotionless clones, have been taught all types of weird things (like cats are evil monsters waiting outside their gates to kill them and rip them to shreds) and for reasons not explained, taught the wrong meanings of words. The interest pretty much ends there as the director delves into bizarre sequences made to shock the viewer. Animal cruelty, incest, violence and physical and mental abuse are just a few of the unpleasant aspects thrown at the viewer. If anything positive can be garnered here, it does hold your interest with incredibility and curiosity and the anticipation of what psycho event is going to take place next. Offbeat but not in a good way."
2,The Emperor's New Film,"Foreign film afficianados seem to make up the potential viewing audience for this Greek train wreck. A prize winner at the Cannes Film Festival, DOGTOOTH is a slow, meandering portrait of family madness and disillusion. I suppose the director is playing out a familial nightmare as a parallel to fascism and societal control but honestly, that's really stretching the point. DOGTOOTH makes its intentions clear within the first 20 minutes and keeps hammering the same issues over and over again with painful obviousness. I saw the film during its second week in Los Angeles where it had been reduced to single weekend showings on Saturday and Sunday. I sat in an audience of 12 people, all of whom were silent throughout. The hipster contingent couldn't muster a single hand clap or boo, preferring to silently file out and cancel that upcoming excoursion to the Greek Isles. My advice: catch the DVD if you're somewhat interested and ponder asto WHY this thing won any notice whatsoever."
1,Offensive to cat lovers,A perfectly good cat was killed for this movie. It was killed off screen but the eviscerated body was shown for everyone's edification. I really did not like this and found the movie more than a little tiresome and pointless. I'm sorry I watched it.
1,worst movie I have ever seen,"This is a very bad movie, boring to the point of pain, you have to strain yourself to stay awake. The ""plot"" (what plot?) seems like a bad idea to start with, and frankly I had no idea what the film was about until I read the *official* review (sure enough, it wasn't about much, basically). The movie should come with an instructions manual, there is a lot of nonsense thrown around in every sentence, until you realize (too late) that most ""concepts"" had been somehow defined in the beginning of the movie, and some words have other meanings to the characters, but even so, it is very tiring to watch, and ""translating"" the dialogue doesn't make it more fun. Watching the movie is like watching a bunch of disinterested idiots throwing meaningless words at each other in monotonous voices, they don't look human enough to warrant attention."
3,?????,"This movie was interesting and entertaining, except for the end, which I thought was very unsatisfactory. It is the story of a truly strange family, yes, but beyond that there was little to capture your imagination or make you want to root for ANY of the characters. It only partially lived up to my expectations."
2,"With some further intelligent effort by the director, this could have been a five star film","One of those European arthouse films that has a very interesting idea. I did not find the film boring. However, the director falls in love with the idea a little bit too much. The idea is good but does not carry through the whole film in its current state. Had the director not been totally in love with the idea he would have pushed the screenplay further. Then he would have ended up with at least a four star film.I give the film two stars, because of the interesting idea. I do not recommend that you buy the film."
2,like watching paint dry,thats how the movie came across most of the time . i wasn't really shocked by it or excited by it either. didn't see any humor in the film or much sensuality .just sad that a father would raise his family that way.
2,Are you in the market for a deeply Godardian satire about the fine line that exists ...,"... between overprotecting your offspring and abusing them?If your answer is yes, then ""Dogtooth"" might just be for you.Unfortunately, I felt the movie made its point fairly early on, then continued to hammer away for well over an hour past that.Three grown children are imprisoned by their parents and forced to submit to arcane rules and competitions until the pressure builds to the breaking point. The ideas and images are determinedly provocative, but ""Dogtooth"" tries too hard and delivers a not-too-profound payoff. Some viewers will love it, others will hate it, I was just left going, ""Yeah, I get it. But why?"""
1,Honestly...,"Since no one else seems to be willing, I'm giving this film the rating it deserves 1 star. This movie was terrible, unfulfilling, and ultimately boring. The only reason I can see for its acclaim is its perverse titillation factor. The obvious political implications don't even make it worth seeing. So lets all collectively get out of the trunk and go see more worthwhile faire."
3,Alright..,"Just got the shirt today.. To be honest, it feels more like a pajama shirt than a ""go out shirt"".Will I return it? No.Will I only wear it around the house? Yes."
3,Worth owning,"My first exposure to Sue Foley was as a warmup band for John Mayall. This lovely, long-haired redhead came out in a little black dress and high heels, wielding a pink guitar. While her appearance was impressive, surely this little cutie couldn't play the blues. My jaw dropped when she tore into her opening number. I subsequently bought this album.As is acknowledged in most of the reviews of her albums, her vocals leave a bit to be desired. Not bad, just not great. But her guitar playing IS great, and the material is well selected (although I could live without Ike Turner's ""Cuban Getaway"").If you like straight-ahead, engaging blues with first-rate guitar work, go for this disk."
2,Typical Bose (not a compliment),"I just took mine apart after one quit working. To be fair, they are about 12 years old, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one. The cabinet had water in it, and I think it was corrosion from the humidity. But the thing is, there is nothing in the cabinet but a single small speaker, maybe 4"". No crossover, no other drivers. I know that's kind of the Bose thing, but the old saw ""no highs, no lows, must be Bose"" makes sense when you see what they're doing it with. I would never buy these again. Kind of like that wave radio they make--nice, for a radio, but not really what you want from your stereo."
1,Items NOT recieved,I ordered the items on the 11th Nov and had an indiaction online that delivery would be made by the 1st DecWhen I tried to make a review on the 1st Dec the online info indicated that I should expect delivery only between the 1st - 16th DecThis was the first I had heard of this. I wrote an email to the seller and to date have NOT had a replyNot a very happy customer
2,Boooring,"Destiny's lack of originality and really weak songs really shocked me. I loved Episode and Visions, and when this cd came out i was more than willing to hear it. What a dissapointment.Where are the great epic songs, where are the killer riffs?... i mean, you can't expect too much variations in the typical ""open string and power chords"" characteristic of stratovarius riffology, but this cd is so weak, really.Maybe the only track that it's worth listening to is SOS."
2,How sad....,"It's really sad that a band as skilled as Stratovarius had put out an album like this.It's not a bad album...it's simply not good for what Stratovarius got us used to.After an album like ""Visions"",this sounds like the guys were sick of it all,and wanted to put out an album as fast as they could.The lyrics are not as meaningful as they used to be on their previous albums.The music sounds as a collection of leftovers.Even the ballads are not as touching as they used to be,and there are too much of them in this album.Definitely,we hope that the guys could make a better effort next time.This was not a good trying,or a bad taste joke."
1,"Michael J. Mathes, you are an idiot.","If you'd actually read Lord Chimp's profile, you might see that what he listens to is far from Korn or Limp Bizkit, and saying he doesn't know about metal or prog is a laugh, considering he's probably explored music to greater lengths than you can even imagine. And either way, it's just a matter of opinion. How dumb and insecure do you have to be to attack someone just because they don't like something? And you're calling people ""kiddies"", like you're so mature? Please.Oh, and I think this album sucks too. Come and get me, tough guy!"
5,"their best effort (maybe not by far, but definitely #1)","Everyone seems to hail ""Visions"" as the best release from Stratovarius, I don't know, it somehow didn't impress me like ""Destiny"" They do not miss a beat on this one, it's flawless. The guitar work is out of this world, Timo is every bit as good as Yngwie Malmsteen, and he proves it on ""Destiny""The production is also top notch, better than any of the other ones, even the newer ones (which SHOULD be better, considering technology gets better over time...)Also, the keys match up to the guitar work on EVERY song, as Jens used to play with Yngwie... Drumming is intense as usual, great drum sound as well. And even though some songs are REALLY, REALLY long, they do not seem to drag at all. IMO there are at least 2 Power Metal anthems on this one, ""Anthem of the World"" (how ironic) and ""Destiny"" HIGHLY reccomended!"
3,Same formula,"I was dissapointed after I listened to this cd. There are some good songs here but it follows the same route as ""Episode"" does but never reaches its heights. To keep to the same formula is fine just as long as the quality of songs is high and there are a few suprises thrown in but this cd seems a little forced. Does have some good songs."
4,"love them, okay album","I'm not entirely crazy for this album, but if you love Stratovarius, I think it's essential. Some of the songs are a little repetitive, but if that doesn't bother you, go for it."
2,Cute but difficult,"If your dog lets you dress him/her, then you will love these slippers. My dog went nuts and I could never get him to sit still long enough- let alone keep more than one on at a time. I know it is cruel, but I just wanted a funny picture!"
5,"more like ""awesome cosmos,"" or ""green awesome"" maybe","a perfect distillation of more recent, ADHD deerhoof, and with a total runtime of ~20 minutes, it's perfect for ritalin-poppers everywhere. Most of the tracks cover familiar territory, but the EP's majestic centerpiece Spiral Golden Town injects a bollywood-esque foundation with extracts of cyndi lauper to reach new heights of gorgeous, semi-ridiculous songcrafting. absolutely essential."
5,Great Mic set for great price,"Based on reccomendations from both here and on Musicians friend for CAD mics, I bought this set for my son to record his drum kit (bass/3 toms/snare/bunch of cymbals). For the price you can't beat these mics for home recording. Sounds great into a mixer then into computer (pro tools software). Decent (secure) mounts, nice case included, quality housings. Most importantly, the sound is high quality. A decent bass sound, very good tom sounds and the condensers are good too. Very pleased, would purchase again..... NOTE: If you don't already have, you will need to purchase 7 XLR mic cables (not included $$$!!!)."
5,Fantastic Mic Set,"I have been recording with this mic kit, and I have only good things to say about it. The price was right, the sound is outstanding, and they mount perfectly onto the rims. I would recommend this set of mics to any drummer in the need of a good, low price kit."
3,"Hitchcock's London-based ""Frenzy"" was based on this book.","Haven't read the book, but featured prominently in opening credits of the movie. Filmed in 1967 and marked his return to London as a filming location."
5,As fast and stylish as its subject matter,"When most noir-era directors are presented with what the critics have read into their films, they tend to laugh. What they were making-- as Muller points out-- were known as either crime dramas or murder dramas. They were made on the cheap, with their dark themes and fast pace borrowed from harboiled crime writing, and with lots of tricks learned from German Expressionism. They were stylish B-movies.Finally, a book has come along that deals with these films and filmmakers pretty much on their own terms. -Highly visual and fast paced. Muller looks at subgenres and trends, but focuses more on looking at the often tortured lives of the people who made these films, and on the turbulent period in Hollywood that the 40s and 50s were.One of my favorite film books, period."
4,Well written but slightly overrated,"Eddie Muller knows what he's writing about. He's one of the finest experts on film noir alive. And, yes, this book is superb in its writing with many wonderful pictures that make it a joy for a quick scan or to slowly peruse.Nevertheless, it seems disappointing on several levels: 1) There are too many plot synopses to the point I actually had to skip a few paragraphs if it was about a noir I hadn't seen; 2) the book seems poorly structured -- actually at times more like a novel; and 3) there isn't one single photo of Jane Greer, one of the finest femme fatales, in the entire book!Admittedly, it's a good book and worth your money. But a definitive reference book it is not."
5,Very important book,"It captured the lost moments of the forgotten glorious era of black and white movies. The photos are out of this world, and the articles added an extra dimension to the magical falir of that lost era. Read it!"
3,Disappointing,"I was looking for a comprehensive book on film noir. This ain't it. I looked up Joan Crawford in the index -- nothing. You've got to be kidding! It's OK for what it covers, but so far my favorite book on noir is ""A Girl and a Gun: The Complete Guide to Film Noir on Video"" by David N. Meyer. The Internet is my favorite source of noir data overall."
2,a real disappointment,"I was left with the feeling that all of this has been said before in one form or another, Where it was ' new' there are other who have already explored the space ( eg The Suport Economy by Shoshana Zuboff) There are two many big words hidding little concepts. The case studies are simplistic and look to the past rather than casting light on the future. This will be another 'fad"" and like all fads find its place in the dustbins of business books"
2,"Content good, style weak","The content of this ""text"" is rich with pointers for those who will format strategic decisions in the future. However, it would seem to challenge the reader to probe the true value of the writers. As the reviewer from Dallas infers, the message is there but the packaging leaves something to be desired. As a university professor who teaches strategic thinking, I see this book as one of the reasons that executives and MBA students resist reading academic pieces: the task is greater than the payoff!!"
4,Students and Business should read,"I enjoyed reading this book. I think the author raised some good points and the book itself could help a small business owner understand how the business landscape is evolving. The author uses some case examples on how other businesses have implemented a co-creation process. These examples are now a bit outdated however, they are current enough to reinforce his point. At the end of the day the author's point was communicated well and easy to understand. If you are looking for a quick read that can potentially increase your understanding of how business is conducted then I would recommend you give this book a shot."
4,traci townsend,this movie was very good.the star as well as the other female actors were very pleasant to look at which sewed it up for me.the storyline is good also.i am looking forward to finding other movies starring this gorgeous star.
5,Excellent service,"I got the DVD in a timely manner, the quality of this product is excellent, I have previously seen the movie so I knew what to expect from it. I saw this movie on TV and I randomly watched it and enjoyed it. I ususally watch free movies on the internet and was disapointed when I could not find this particular film. Then I found it on amazon for a cheap price and I jumped at it because I have already seen the movie. If you haven't seen any movie I wouldn't recommend you purchase any movie because you might be disapointed. But like I said, I have already seen the movie and was excited when I recieved it in the mail in a timely matter."
3,Not all that,"I did not enjoy this movie that much. It was a low budget film to me. Although you can relate to this, the jumping through scenes made it not so good."
4,"Not perfect, but good enough that we're ordering another one!","My mom purchased this as a gift. After some of the negative reviews, we decided to assemble it immediately so we could see if there were any problems. The grooves on one end of one post were a little shallower than the other ends, but not too bad; and the directions are in very tiny print. But overall, it was easy to assemble, and very solid once we assembled it. Mom liked it so well, we're ordering one for her."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I purchased this blanket rack and am very disappointed with it. When I received this in the mail on of the legs was drilled incorrectly. I called the Powell company for a replacement part. They sent the replacement part but the groves in the leg did not match notches that were supposed to slide into the grove. Now it still can't be assembled. I was mad and decided instead of calling them again and having another part sent I would force it to fit. (I don't recommend doing this, but in the heat of the moment I must say I did it anyway.) Anyway, I would just recommend buying a different blanket rack. This one is a waste of time and money. I always say this and I just found another example demonstrating the truth: You get what you pay for!"
2,Cheap,"This product is pretty to look at. But nothing more. It was not stable and arrived with some damage (chips/scratches) This is not a product to display quilts, etc. it will break. Mine broke off at the leg. This product is not sturdy."
1,Poorly made,"The product is beautiful as far as looks, but poor quality. Only had it a short while, and the back legs are broke. We are seniors. There aren't any children in the home."
1,Mistake,"Very dissatisfied with this purchase. The holes on the base did not line-up for the screws. In tryingto assemble, the base cracked. My husband used some very good glue and so far it is holding. Buy a bargainand you get a bargain."
1,not recomended,"sooooo disappointed, the product was defective but my husband was able to fix it, some of the part were crack and damage"
1,Don't buy,"This is a very cheap,Chinese-made, waste of money. The wood is so thin that it split while trying to assemble. Instructions are printed on rice paper and the parts are mislabeled. Based upon the my experience with this product, I will neve buy another product from this company."
