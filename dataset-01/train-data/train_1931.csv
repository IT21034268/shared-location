3,Necessary Evil,"Pros:- It's a hood- The adapter ring is of nice constructionCons:- Expensive for just a hood!- The hood itself (that clips onto the adapter ring) feels a little on the cheap side with the way the plastic clips onto the adapter ring- I don't have huge fingers, but it's difficult for me to get my fingers in there to manually focus my Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens.Overall:A necessary evil. I think I was able to swallow the steep price for this because I just thought about how much I invested in the camera, memory cards, lenses, bags, etc. and this seemed negligible :P"
3,A necessary evil?,"The lens that this fits on is so cheap I guess Canon could not resist making a little money back on the cover. What are you going to do? You need to protect your glass .... this thing is tiny and comes in two parts, one which screws onto the end of your lens to enable this to clip on.Its fine now -- was a bit disheartening when I got it in the mail and the box was a little bit thicker than a pack of smokes."
2,does it matter?,very awkward hood which by appearance is quite small. not sure if it acutally makes a difference and so far i've left it off the lens. not quick to get on and off.
4,Works well,"Careful, it feels kind of flimsy and bends easily. I can envision the pressure ring inside the hood breaking easily."
2,O.K.. . . . . . . . . . . .. . .. . . . . .. .,O.K.. but lens hood flexes when you press to insert lens hood in mounting attachment / ring.Thanks for the service
4,Meh,"There's probably $0.02 of plastic in this thing. Amortize the die and stamping costs across all the units produced and that's probably like $0.10 each. Assembly, packing, shipping maybe another $0.10, and overhead costs around $0.10 if we're being extremely generous. The upshot is that there's no way there's over $0.50 of cost to produce one of these suckers. They're basically pure profit. Lens covers are to the camera world what printer ink is to printers.So yeah, you're getting ripped off, but you expected it. That being said, it does what it's supposed to do. It's a bit difficult to put on and remove, and you wonder what the lifetime of the squeezy plastic bits that facilitate this process are."
2,regret getting it,"I think it's too pricey for what you're getting. This is a flimsy plastic hood with a metal ring adapter which screws onto the front of the lens. Canon probably gets both pieces manufactured for pennies. The two pieces awkwardly fit together and it's tricky to get the hood mounted onto the ring. So, 1 star for cool looks and 1 star for trying."
2,Canon f/1.8 Users Beware,"I would suggest anyone who is considering purchasing this hood to strongly reconsider. A rubberized collapsible hood is the way to go.While the 50mm f/1.8 is an exceptionally affordable lens and produces great photos, it has substantial weak points due to its plastic construction that prevent the use of a lens hood. The lens hood is very susceptible to sideways knocks which are exacerbated when the lens hood is attached. I bumped mine and as most people found, the front element dropped off. The interior of the lens is held together by four plastic clips. One or more of the tabs will be broken and while it is possible to re-attach it, the lens will be wobbly or have a much grittier auto-focus noise.So, buyers beware: The increased leverage on the front element produced by this lens hood will break apart the lens upon a sideways impact especially when the front element is extended."
1,Rip Off,"It's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs -- this hood. How can you pay $75 for a great prime lens, and $25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it?"
3,"Not the best fit, but it works","The adapter screws on to the filter threads, and then the oversized hood snaps (via two plastic squeeze tabs) on to that. Since the lens doesn't zoom there isn't much chance of vinetteing, but it looks a bit akward and because it's so wide I'm not sure how much glare it keeps out.However, if you (like me) bought this lens for low-light work because of the f-stop, you're also buying this hood for the same reason I did: lens protection (vs lens flare.) Since it's the only one Canon offers currently, it's really your only bet."
1,"POS, broke quickly, difficult to install","I have one positive thing to say about this hood: It makes the camera look pretty cool and professional. Other than that, this thing is a piece of s**t that broke a month or two after I got it. The clip-on mechanism is poorly designed and hard to use even when it's not broken. Why don't they just make it screw-in? I'm not sure if this is the only option for this lens, I haven't looked yet. You have to use a hood so I might be forced to buy another one, but I would stay away from it if at all possible.Update 4/24/07: I bought a rubber fold-up hood on eBay, and it's infinitely better than the Canon. It screws solidly into the hood adapter, and folds up out of the way when not in use. I highly recommend getting that instead of this garbage."
2,Canon needs to redesign!,"Hello All,Lens hoods are pretty much a necessity, but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood I've ever used. Unlike other hoods that screw on, this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one, and release the clips. This leads to problems of alignment, meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right. Although it's a pain and I hate...I don't really have another alternative. Either go w/o a hood, or take this one. Either way, guess I'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one."
1,Completely non-functional design.,"Despite many photographers making fun of people that leave their hoods on the lens reversed, I personally like doing that from time to time. That was the main purpose I bought this over the cheaper Photodiox hood. However, the design of this hood makes it unusable.Please see my pictures to clearly see the problem. You press buttons on opposing sides to retract tabs in order to secure the hood to the threaded lens attachment; but pressing the buttons compresses the hood making it extremely difficult to attach. This makes de/re-taching the hood a very frustrating task. And because the hood is free-floating on the ring, you cannot remove the hood from the lens without first removing the hood from the attachment ring.This design was so poorly implemented, I'm really surprised it is sold. This will sit in the box on my shelf. I wouldn't accept this if given to me for free. Get the simple Photodiox hood for less money and better design."
4,It Works For Me,"When I used my 50mm 1.8 outside in bright sunlight I frequently got very overexposed pictures, more than two stops in some cases using aperture priority on my Rebel XSI. I partially remedied that by setting my exposure -2/3. I agree with others this is overpriced for a piece of plastic, but since adding this filter I have no overexposures. It's worth it for me."
5,Str8 out of da nashville area the Wicked East,I think Wicked would really blow up if they wanted to. If they get with the right people they will but they do good in the area this album is a real ass album no flague on this album came real telling everyone that the east is real but the WIcked is the realest.
4,its aight,these cats came hard tho. the beats aight. young buck made a appearance on blucka blucka. i would buy it tho.
1,Not what it seems,"This looks like a nice ring in the picture on the site, but in reality it's really rough. I returned it for my money back because I was really disappointed in the quality of the ring. For sixty dollars i was expecting something really nicely fabricated, but the outside piece didn't spin properly (at a certain point i had to force it to spin), the saldering at the seam was awful and obvious, and there were notches and imperfections all over it. Just really disappointingly poor quality. Don't trust the picture."
3,Where's the fire?,"It's been too long since Canada's borders were sealed to stop the viral outbreaks that terrorists had unleashed upon the country from spreading around the globe. When Mountie Day Daniels' partner is brutally murdered during an investigation, the last thing she wants is a partner interfering with her. But Lian Firebird is not an ordinary partner. He is a plague hunter, and suddenly he is in charge of the case because of the threat of a new outbreak the murder uncovers. The chase is on to catch the virus before it destroys the chance to open Canada's borders once again. Day of Fire is a somber tale set in a bleak future and its lacks the pulpy energy of the premiere book in the 2176 series. There just wasn't enough fire to hold my interest for long periods of reading time."
2,"Save your money, buy Stiff Upper Lip instead","I love AC/DC, but this dvd stinks. The audio is off sync with the video, and the quality of the audio is bad anyway. The video is shot really well, but I felt like I was watching a recording where the audio plugs weren't connected right. I took another chance and bought Stiff Upper Lip, and it was much, much better. An energetic concert, with great sound, excellent camera work, and fun! I've seen AC/DC in concert and this is as close as you'll get to being there."
4,AC/DC ROCKS!!!!,"I had seen AC/DC way back in 1978 in Denver, at Red rocks with Blue Oyster Cult. WOW, at that time I did not really know who AC/DC was. I watched Angus RUN all over the stage back and forth all through the show. The roadies carried him through the audience, all the while playing Bad Boy Boogie Solo. HOLY CRAP, Bon Scott was unbelieveable. That was when I found out AC/DC ROCKS. After Bons' passing I lost track of the group. When they aquired Brian, I paid no attention,thinking its not the same. Then I heard ""Hard as a Rock."" WOW, again I started paying more attention. I started collecting Concerts of AC/DC I found ""No Bull"", purchased it. Again WOW. The DVD was destroyed by carelessness on my part. I happened to see it on amazon, and picked it up again. THIS time I'll take better care of it. One of their better shows I think."
2,Director doesn't have a clue!,"Don't get me wrong, I love AC/DC, which is why I bought the DVD. The concert is amazing, and that's the whole problem. The camera work and editing is so disjointed and frenetic, you never get to watch the band in action. The entire concert is filmed with switches between cameras almost as fast as the music, and I guess that is what the director was going for. But there is never focus on the band as a whole, or their interactions, let alone concentrating on any one member for more that 1 second.Huge disappointment."
2,Not so much the sound....,"Does the director of this DVD suffer from A.D.D? The picture quality is very good...yes, the sound could be better, but HOLY COW, what's with cutting to a different camera angle every other second? I can see this one triggering an epileptic seizure faster than a strobe light! Guess I'll have to pick up ""Live at Donington"", and hope that the editing is less frenetic."
5,NO BULL ABOUT THIS DVD,"Well What can I say ? This DVD is the best its gonna get for the no Bonn Scott era. AC/DC rocks the house with this one. The sound and video are all top notch, the selection of songs is damn good. Im very happy with the over all flavor and feel of this DVD, it captures the raw electric feeling of AC/DC live. Angus Young sounds as good as he ever has, never missing a note or a change, while still making you feel like hes playing solos just for you. I must admit Brian Johnson sounds just fine on all the older tunes. If you want AC/DC live on DVD its not gonna get any better then this ............."
4,"About the ""5.1"" sound mix.....","IN RESPONSE OF A REVIEW THAT I JUST READ ABOUT THIS DVD, THE DOLBY DIGITAL TRACK IS 5.0, NOT 5.1. THIS MAKES YOU PRACTICALLY ""BASSLESS"" IF YOU HAVE A HOME THEATER WITH 5 SPEAKERS AND A SUBWOOFER, THIS LAST ONE WILL NOT SOUND AT ALL. HOWEVER YOU CAN FIX THIS LITTLE PROBLEM BY LISTENING TO THE 2.0 (STEREO) SOUND AND USE YOUR DOLBY PRO LOGIC DECODER ON THE HOME THEATER RECEIVER OR AMP, YOU'LL HAVE BEST SURROUND SOUND THIS WAY AND YOUR SUBWOOFER WILL DO HIS JOB VERY WELL."
5,electrifying angus at his best,"not only does this video have some great songs but it also has great props including a huge rosie balloon and a giant wrecking ball, and best of all is angus' 10-15 minute solo without any rythm guitar or drums, at one point in the solo he's elevated on a platform in the middle of the audience bottom line...... GREAT VIDEO"
3,True to life but bad sound.,"I think the title says it all- No Bull. It appears that the production studio did nothing to ""gloss up"" the sound of this concert. That is the good and the bad of it. Just like any rock band they hit sour notes but in this case they left them in the final cut! I think shows a lot of integrity but unfortunately it is not that fun to listen to when you have an elaborate surround sound system. In the end it sounds pretty much like the actual concert but minus the bass. Live at the Donnington is definately more fun to listen to."
1,Big Hype....No Sound,"The sound quality of this DVD is a huge disappointment. After hearing a laser disc from a concert recorded several years earlier, NO BULL was money wasted."
3,INSYNC NOT!,"For whatever reason, my DVD copy is not in-sync. The audio and the video are a second off of each other. What gives? I also don't think the sound quality is that good. This is a lot to pay for a inferior produced product. I love AC/DC but this is not up to their standards."
4,Essential for AC DC fans,"If you like AC DC this is a great way to go to complete your collection, the stage is impressive and they make a heck of a good show. These guys know how to rock a concert, believe me seeing this is like being in the concert yourself, it is a great show. Sound is good but i think they could done a better job, besides is a live show I can understand. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. This guys have one of the best bands ever."
4,VERY GOOD - GREAT PRODUCTION,"This shows in Spain is amazing. The stage production is almost unbeliavable, so gerat and good it is. Phil Rudd is back on drums, and that's why this is better than ""DONINGTON"". Brian Johnson is losing his voice, but anyway it sounds good. Song selection is also good. The place is totally sold-out, energy flows everywhere, uau !"
2,Not bad but not great either,"Having seen AC/DC live a couple of times over ten years ago, I was excited to see the No Bull Madrid concert on DVD. All in all, it was disappointing for two reasons. First Brian Johnson's voice did *not* sound good (and post-production obviously couldn't help afterwards) and second, the nice long set was diminished by a lack of stage show. Angus Young running up and down the stage is entertaining for the first couple of times, but grows old quickly. Apart from the bell and cannons (gee what a surprise), that was the sum total of the show.I give the movie 2 stars. I will have to be very bored to watch it again."
2,"NO BULL? Maybe not, but.........","My guess is that the original release of this concert had poor sales. I say that because I have all of the major ac/dc in concert video releases, and this is the poorest-produced one of the bunch. The instruments have a ""distant"" sound, for some reason, unlike Live at Donnington. Sooooooooooooo, since the sales of No Bull originally were poor, they thought they'd release a ""director's cut"" of it to entice hard-core sales, but guess what? It STILL sounds the same, only now there is 2 hours of it! If you don't own any ac/dc concert dvds and you perhaps, are a new fan, get Live at Donnington. That's one of the best dvd concerts in the whole world, but pass No Bull up. To be NO BULL, it sure is FULL OF BULL!"
2,Tristan und Isolde,"Music is superb.I think it is even better than my CD favorite conducted and recorded by Carlos Kleiber.The sound is beautiful here because of superior DVD audio format.Why then, only two stars given?It's camera work;It's simply the worst ever seen.The post modern, avant-garde, or whatever you call, this new stage design is not that bad.But it is so sad to see that everything was lost because of horrendously poor camera work.You will be watching cruelly revealing close-up shots of badly made-up face of Isolde all through the opera.It only makes you sad because her singing is so marvelous; you have to close your eyes to appreciate it.Then why do you have to watch the DVD?"
1,Not so hot Tristan und Isolde,"The major problem with this is Waltrude Meier as Isolde. She is essentially a mezzo and she sounds it in this production, with sad results, as she attempts the soprano heights the role demands at every turn of the page of the score. This is terrible, because Deborah Voight and Jane Eaglen are out there with the proper voices and are not recorded on Cd or DVD. The rest of this cast is OK, but it's tenth rate all the way, withtired out conducting of an underpowered orchestra.Buy Lohengrin with Eva Marton and Leonie Rysanek, and wait for the better manifestation of this masterpiece."
2,A moustache on the Mona Lisa. . .,"As if Wagner's music and poetry could not be trusted, this ""controversial"" (read STUPID) production is like a trash bag fullof silly tricks. Act I is garishly staged on a cartoonish yacht (harsh lighting, primary colors, the set like a childs paper cut out), the potionsplaced in highball glasses, Tristan SHAVES for almost theentire act (What in the WORLD does it mean???). Act II fareslittle better, with Tristan rolling on a floral divan on which to sing.Act III does redeem the whole affair somewhat, with its slideshowof Tristans childhood memories and muted palette of colors.Mehta looks embarrassed from the get go, but the orchestra plays beautifully, and the principal singers persevere despite the foolishnessthey are called upon to suffer (did I mention the COSTUMES???).Just AVOID this, especially if it is your first Tristan: you'll neverreturn to this opera if this travesty is your maiden voyage. Thepackaging should come with a warning lable. . ."
1,not very good,I bought this as new but it was clearly a copy and the second disc was of very bad quality.
1,Disgusting: don't buy it!,"Act one takes place on a poorly conceived idea of a modern yacht, with Tristan's face blotched by shaving cream and no tiller in sight, although he is described as being at the tiller three times. Who knows what the Act II set is supposed to represent! Act three takes place in a cheap fleabag hotel room.Modern designers and directors only want to stroke their own egos by destroying the artistic achievements of others. Apparently incapable of understanding the concept of legend or myth, they reduce everything to the tawdry modernism, but they cannot even do this as well as true artists and thinkers such as Samuel Beckett have done it. The real shame here is that these stupid settings and costumes obscure really fine singing and orchestral playing and conducting. Closing your eyes helps, but then why buy the DVD?There is only one word for this product: G-A-R-B-A-G-E!!!!!"
2,Perplexing production,"I found this production of Wagner's great music drama to be perplexing to the extreme. The direction is really obscure, and it does nothing to highlight the emotion of the drama or the subtleties of the plot. The staging is also unatmospheric and confusing.Meier is a good but slightly under-powered Isolde. West's Tristan is not on the same level, his singing often off-pitch and ugly. Lipvosek is miscast as Brangaene. The other roles are merely adequately taken. The orchestral playing is rather lifeless, too.A rather disappointing production."
4,MEIER'S BEST ISOLDE ON DVD,"Waltraud Meier is currently my favorite Isolde, and Marjana Lipovsek my favorite Brangane. For me, those are the two stellar performances of the production. Meier sings the finale (the ""liebestod"") like somebody dissolving in oceanic transcendence. Unfortunately, Jon Fredric West is not my ideal Tristan. But the biggest problem with the production is the clownish staging and costumes, which do everything possible to undermine Meier's FANTASTIC performance. Meir is simply a legendary Isolde. In my opinion, she's even better here than in her two Barenboim performances currently on DVD. And Mehta is not even my favorite conductor of this opera, but Meir comes passionately alive under his baton."
2,Uncle Sammy,The music is great. This was my first experience with SAMMY and I found it very tastie. The reason for the rating was not musical quality but rather the quality of the disk. The last track or two is defective and skips. I don't think I will buy a used item again.
3,"Vintage Boulez, poorly edited","This DVD features Boulez at his best. Here we see him relaxed as ever conducting some of the thorniest music around. His ability to hear everything and gently coax the players to perfection is greatly displayed here. His commentary is also very good.What I found most annoying is that the commentary is frequently over the music. This would be OK if we actually heard the music at another time but frequently we don't. The worst is the spoken remarks placed over the final minutes of the Berg 3 Pieces. This shattering moment in music is completely lost. For instance, we see the percussionist bashing the Mahler hammer to the floor but can barely hear it.Aside from that BIG caveat, the DVD features great music, great playing and great Boulez. Too bad the editing couldn't have been the same."
4,Excellent Mandarin Finale,"I thought this rehearsal was insightful and really loved the performance. Watching this I realized how much the middle movement relies on the clarinet soloist, the whole orchestra pivots off this instrument."
3,"Audio Squashed, and No Performance","While there is much to appreciate here in both the music and the gifted artists at work, this DVD is only somewhat satisfactory.The audio is limited clumsily so that there is no depth in the sound. Worse, at climaxes, only the loudest sound can be heard at all. A fortissimo cymbal crash or bass pizzicato completely takes over at these moments, so that the rest of the orchestra seems to disappear for a couple of seconds.Also, be aware that IN REHEARSAL is only that: 57 minutes of rehearsal footage. There is no performance of either the Berg or the Boulez works. It would have been much more enjoyable and instructive to hear the finished results."
4,Like being at the club,"This album (is that word still usable?) is a recording of a nightclub tribute to the music of William Finn, one of our best current composers of musicals. The songs are excellent and the singers fantastic. You don't get the polished sound of a studio recording but instead the feeling that you are there listening to an all star cast sing some wonderful songs. You also get some of the banter between Finn and the singers as he introduces them. Finn sings a few tunes, and while you wouldn't cast him for a real show, his sense of humor makes his performaces in a few mostly comic tunes a delight as well."
4,Finn singing his own stuff.,"Like many composers, Finn should not sing, but that's what makes it fun. While he has wonderful and talented stars sing for him on this CD, I get a real kick out of his few attempts at the mic.(Republicans beware - you have been made aware of the content herein.)Finn's raw charm shines though on this one, and it make a nice accompanyment CD to the Off-Broadway Musical ""Make Me a Song."""
2,(Not so) Infitine Joy to fans's of William Finn,"When I first saw this recording I was SO excited....afterall I saw March of the Falsetto's off Broadway and then Falsettos on Broadway and it changed my life. My biggest beef with the recording of Infinite Joy is it sounds like everyone who was there for that evening at Joe's Pub had a grand ol time but it doesn't translate well for the listener at home. Two of my favorite all time Finn songs are also omitted, What Would I Do & What More Can I Say...I would have loved to have heard another rendition of these songs. Maybe one day we can get this incredibly talented ensemble to record FALETTOLAND in concert. I hope I'm not being too tough, I just expected more JOY."
2,Ukelele-playing Israelis Beware!,"As ever, Mr. Finn rhymes, for example, ukeleles and Israeli, a forced and excrutiating example of his unremittingly poor lyrics. His music, because it displays so little training and discipline, has a quality of wildness about it, which many people mistake for originality. In truth, it's clunky and awful. Mr. Finn writes with sincerity, directly from the heart, for which he should be applauded, given the state of theater songs. However, sincerity and emotional directness alone aren't enough. It seems as if--going all the way back to Falsettos--he bangs out a number in a day or so, then doesn't revise; certainly his music is anything but thought out. His lyrics have always seemed as if he'll shamelessly combine any words, even if they don't really come close to rhyming, or make any sense. Two stars for sincerity; none for beauty or skill. And by the way, I hadn't heard--HAS he taken up residence in Israel?"
3,Skip William Finn's tracks,"Sometimes great songwriters can perform their own songs. You give Bruce Springsteen or Bob Dylan a break, because their songs are so great, you allow them to sing with a terrible voice. In my opinion, William Finn crosses the line. He is the worst songwriter/singer I have ever heard. His singing is so bad it is almost enough to make me never want to take this CD out again. It is bad enough that I will forever skip over his tracks. Fortunately, the other tracks are very enjoyable. He should have sense enough to let ""singers"" sing his wonderful songs."
4,"Wonderful Music, Wonderful Fun!","I had always been aware of William Finn but had never got around to listening to his music. This was my first introduction to it. I loved every second of this cabaret act. I will definetely be checking out more of his shows. I was thouroughly entertained as if I were actually in the audience. A real winner! I think Mr. Finn's performance is wonderful. Yes, he isn't a polished performer, but so what? He knows how to perform the music, he wrote it. Don't miss this one!"
2,Audio Book--What a bore,"I got this book on cd and it is just a bore. I can not finish it. The reader gives it no thrill. I don't even know if this is a good book, it's not worth plodding thru, the reading reminds one of elevator music."
2,halliedoesnt seem 40,"While I know the main character, Hallie, is suppose to be in her 40's with two grown children and a 20+ year marriage under her belt at times it is very hard to remember that...it seems more like she is 20 most times. I found it hard to read, the plot didnt always line up again I think it had to do with the characters change in age throughout the book"
3,Fast Read for a Weekend,"I loved the premise of The Men I Didn't Marry - who hasn't thought about ""what if"" with some old flames. So, I read the book on that premise alone.I thought each old boyfriend was interesting - but I had several problems with the book in general. So, Hallie's 40 something and her husband leaves just as their kids fly the nest. 1. Even if you are a high powered lawyer - (????) aren't you the least concerned about money -especially when you take to your bed eating oreos? 2. You're in your 40's and haven't seen any of these men in 20 years - yet you jump in feet first to see them? Nobody has that much self confidence! 3. Your kids adore you and show up on an island?This was a cute book - I did enjoy the read - but I think it could have been filled out a bit more."
3,"Mixed feelings, mixed review","I listened to the unabridged audio book on CD narrated by Susan Denaker.The narrator has a pleasant voice but didn't add much oomph to the story. The characters often sounded alike vocally. But the narration was an easy listen.The cover art gave me the expectation that this book would be an amusing girlsfriends adventure rather than the mostly-solo journey of self discovery it was. So instead of the hilarious book I expected, it was a deeper, more touching story.As with some of the reviewers of the print book, there are many aspects of the book that require the suspension of disbelief -- such as that nearly all the ex-boyfriends were so happy to see Hallie after 20+ years.I probably wouldn't read or listen to this book again, but it wasn't a waste of time. It was a pleasant way to pass some time."
1,Way tooo simplistic,"If you have any 3d experience at all the Materials video isnt worth the time and money. Its probably good for beginners but its very very repetitive and doesnt give alot of infomration or tricks just veyr very basic stuff..I was planning on buying all the tapes because id heard they were good but i wont buy the rest. Its too bad their arent any good training materials for XSI as there are for MAX..I bought some of the Cumbria series video cds for XSI also and they were pretty awful also the best training is the free cd from softimage its advanced and it doesnt WASTE timne on useles repetition of the same steps over and over again as Ed Harriss does with these tapes. Ed's site is a good resource, the tapes aren't."
1,Be aware -- not for Digital EOS cameras,Please be aware -- this warranty can not be used for digital Canon EOS cameras. I didn't notice this and had to return mine.
3,Just a word of warning....,"If you're thinking this is a Christmas disc by the glam rock band Girl, it isn't. It's a Christmas disc by a swing/big band outfit, presumably from the west coast. Not much point in a full review, since it doesn't really belong with the group it comes up with. I will admit that I gave it three stars only on account of some less-than-stellar sound quality. In terms of performance and arrangements, they're just fine. BBVD, Royal Crescent Mob or Indigo Swing, they're not.I suppose I assumed too much when I found it lumped in with the other Girl offerings on Amazon. No need for anyone else to repeat my mistake."
2,"Well, there's TWO good songs on it!","I suggest you weigh and measure the amount of money you put on the value of TWO good songs; since Queensryche's ""Eye's of a Stranger,"" and Judas Priest's ""Beyond the Realms ..."" are, in my opinion, the ONLY TWO SONGS worthy of the amount of money spent on this CD."
2,Incorrect release date...,I worked on this film and it was not released 1/1/79. It was filmed in 1989 and never given a theatrical release in the U.S.A.
3,Singing quality,"While Julie Andrews is wonderful, it is interesting that the vocal quality of other ladies in the cast does not match. It does provide a good idea of the show, though."
2,"Great show, terrible recording","This is a really cute show. I just produced it with my high school kids, and everyone loved it - cast, crew, audience. Really successful. We almost didn't do the show, however, because this recording is so appalling. Julie Andrews shines in her first Broadway show, but it's almost like they picked everyone else to be really bad so that she would look really good. The men are decent, but the women just make you cringe. If you're looking for a cute little show for community theatre and high school, this is it -- but don't buy the CD!Incidentally, Julie Andrews is producing a revival of this show for Broadway for the 2004 season. Maybe a new cast recording will accompany it - one can only hope!"
2,a little bit hard to fit.,"It's not what really hoped, because is a little bit difficult to fit to the lens."
1,expired,i received this item and the date on the jar of sauce expiredalready ... as you can guess i am not pleased that i ruined an batch of wings
5,Kim Does It Again,"I have been a major fan of Kim's music since Kids In America was released.Once again Kim has produced an awesome album. Great driving 80's pop.She is such a talented artist, and has always maintained a high standard of quality in her music."
1,Why buy Used when New can be had for same price?,"Sheet music plus has this and the music tree teaching books, newest editions, for similar prices."
5,LOVED IT!,Angel Wiley is a movie star who is being stalked. Joe MacBride is a rancher who is considered a womanhater. Angel goes to Joe's ranch to hide out from her stalker. But she doesn't count on falling in love with Joe. Can he defend her from the monster who would destroy her? I loved this story. I will definately look for more books by this author~~
3,The cassette does not have good quality sound.,If the quality of the sound on the cassette was better I would have rated it 5 stars. I teach high functioning children with autism ages 7-11. They enjoyed the songs but it was difficult to make out the words at times because of the quality of the tape. I do not know if I just got a bad cassette or they all sound that way.
3,Look lovely but things slip off.,"I bought these hangers on impulse thinking they would be nice for my lingerie. The are lovely, however most things do slip off of them. Perhaps I a not using them for the right clothing? I would be interested to hear how others use them. They are well made."
4,Relax,"The only reason it doesn't get five stars from me is that I don't feel it quite as good as some of her previous albums. It is a difficult thing to cover jazz standards, It opens you up to comparisons and criticisms. To all that I say turn the lights low, put on this cd and relax, It's a joy to get lost in."
3,definitely not her best recording,"Patricia Barber's strength derives from her abilities as a narrator and her unique approach is strikingly evident in releases such as Modern Cool and Companion... It's a surprise she came up with an album dedicated to jazz standards. Patricia Barber is not ""the jazz vocalist"" and, therefore, the music sounds tasteless. Nightclub is a production catastrophe (hopefully, not caused by the artist's own preferences)."
3,"Patricia is a well kept secret, but i've found out about her","Do you ever get a special sensation when you first play a new cd? Can you just feel from the first track that this cd is it, the one you have been looking for?Well enter Patricia Barber. I can not say enough good things about this wonderful crooner. She has the complete package to do the jazz thing. First, she is a brilliant jazz pianist. Second she has the ideal voice to sing jazz. Wowl! What a talent she possesses.For this project I thought Patty did a good job with both of her instruments, her voice and her piano. She even used a repertoire that was accomidating. What a deal!(...) set.Recommendation: I would like to strongly recommend this cd."
2,Not Patricia's best by a long way,"I've collected Patricia voraciously with each new release. Along came Nightclub and I was there, forking over my hard earned all too eagerly. Expecting the usual dark brooding 'tinging' (talk/singing) that she does so well, and her unique interpretations of jazz standards I was most disappointed. This album no doubt, is a well executed, beautifully recorded jazz piece that captures that late night ambience she set out to do. It just lacks the dynamism and originality her previous albums have had. Also, because there is a greater emphasis on the singing, which she ain't great at, it just tends to annoyance. I didn't even listen through when usually I'm planted on the couch from start to finish. Her best work in my opinion comes from CDs Companion, Modern Cool and Cafe Blue. These rate 10 stars on a 5 star scale. She can be awesome but this is a 2* effort compared to previous releases.Cheers, Kendrick"
4,"Very good, but...","Patricia Barber's CD is wonderful in most aspects. Her vocal style is unique and absolutely amazing, and her piano skills are great. The only thing I think could've been done better on this recording is swinging. She could accent the offbeats a bit more, but other than that it is perfect."
4,Remastered or not,"I question whether this is a remastered version, because it has the same issue date as the original in 2000.Nowhere does it say who did the remastering , date of remastering or any details if it was indeed remastered."
2,A Lilith Fair Session,"Her voice is just too thin and ""folky"" to do these songs justice. As hip as her postmodern style was on her previous CDs, she was always missing one thing that traditional jazz singers had: A voice! And it's painfully more clear with this CD."
3,I have A Question,"Does Barbara sing some of these tunes out of ""tune"" on purpose,or is it that she produced her own album and nobody had the courage to tell her?Try listening to ""Yesterdays"". It sometimes hurts your ears."
2,...ubiq...,"Certainly imbued with atmosphere.. however, one can't get over the notion that Ms. Barber is your typical modern psuedo-intellectual woman. For young people only.. (or yuppies)..."
2,One problem only,"The instrumental playing is fine on this album. However, this woman proves - once more - that she cannot carry a tune. And the usual lapses into her mumbling vocal mannerism are here again. She sounds like she's wearing Doc Martens on her tongue.Hype and cult following just don't make up for these flaws."
4,Barber's intent,"Regarding the above ""Goldgar"" view of Barber's ""off key"" singing:Barber will sometimes change the color of a chord by singing a pitch close to the expected one. This adds some artistic interest to my listening. For example: She could sing a C melody note, while playing a C triad chord as harmony. However, she will lower the C melody note by 1/2 step, and in so doing she creates a C Maj7 chord. This is subtle, but it adds interest if you are open to this artistic approach. You are not hearing the exact melody note which you expected, but in its place you are hearing a slight variation of the harmony.Barber sings with a lot of emotion. Her piano work is just O.K., in my opinion. The other musicians create a mellow background for her singing. ""Invitation"" is an excellent cut on this CD. Enjoy."
4,A Different Nod to the Mainstream,"Patricia Barber is a wonderful artist, one who uses a rather limited, smoky contralto to its maximum effect in a highly creative way. Like her singing, her piano is spare, yet never wastes a note. This album is her nod to the Mainstream, and as such, it's worth a listen. The highlight is the first cut, or a very creative cover of ""Bye Bye Blackbird."" I appreciate anyone who covers the theme song from ""A Man and a Woman"" because it's actually a very nice tune and done so seldomly. If you like this, it's a good intro to Ms. Barber's more advenurous and ultimately more satisfying efforts."
5,yes,"Anyone who loves sad and melancholy jazz standards and smokey female voices will love this. Barber is the perfect companion to a night alone and lonely and the backup and arrangments are very good. Her voice has strength, personality and experience and she sings the songs cleanly without affectation and jazzy cuteness. A wonderful album. A note to lovers of this album: the other Barber albums are good but lack the song quality of these old standards and are generally more artistic and less standard jazz vocals."
2,"DUMB, BUT DOES HAVE ITS MOMENTS! 2 1/2 STARS!","Liking this film depends on just how tolerant of political incorrectness you are and forgiving of such dumb storylines. The film gets a big boost from the actors who in most cases are way better than the likes of this film, but know how to laugh at themselves and just go with it. It's a short little ""dumb dumb"" of a movie only clocking in at about an hour and fifteen minutes, but I found enough here to keep me chuckling for the most part. I also applaud the political incorrectness, because I'm a little tired of filmmakers walking on eggshells all of the time. If you see it on cable take out your brain and just go with it, its really a pretty funny little movie."
5,Fantastic Disc!!!,"This is one of the 10 greatest CD's that I have ever listened to.The rendition of Alexander Nevsky is fantastic. Full of drama, passion, all without the excess romanticism of other versions. Reiner always stays true to the score.He does the same with the Lt. Kije. From the opening trumpet solo to the very last note, the Chicago Symphony never faulters."
1,Disappointing,"Junk programs, mostly trial offers. Many of these trial programs cannot be permanently installed because the programmers stopped supporting them by website. Get ready to pay, and no payment will be accepted. Then you only have the option to delete the program.What a waste of time and money."
3,just ok--,This is a cheaply made fan and had some broken pieces when I received it but it did not impair it's ability to work. You get what you pay for.
2,not quite up to snuff,"While the author does a decent job summarizing someone else's work, the look and content of this title is a clear attempt to cash in on the popularity of the books and films. Within its pages, you'll find reproductions of ""Teen Beat"" style magazine covers featuring the movies' stars, and quickly see that the material covered is far from comprehensive. A much better choice for a book of this nature is Fionna Boyle's ""A Muggle's Guide to the Wizarding World,"" also available through amazon.com."
4,A Ten Year Old's Perspective,"I enjoyed reading this book. It had lots of useful information about J.K. Rowling in the large biography, and I finally found out what the J.K. stood for. But my favorite part by far was the Muggle's guide to Harry Potter. It had a lot of stuff I didn't remember, and new stuff I didn't know about. The Guide was interesting and full of information that I was looking for, such as how many knuts equal a sickle, and how much it costs to ride the Knight Bus. So basically it was a very original book."
1,not what i thought,"it is a long listing of all things you can collect from harry potter. While i enjoy the HP series, I had no idea that this book would be SO boring. I don't care what all i can collect, I wanted background and comparisons. Yuck!"
4,Indispensible Potter Companion!,"Every time I open this book, I find another nugget of information. Easy to read and well-organized, Muggles and Magic tells the reader everything he or she ever wanted to know about J. K. Rowling and the world of Harry Potter, and then some. I only hope that George Beahm will consider putting together a follow-up volume after Books 6 and 7 are published!"
3,Muggles and Magic,"I bought the book very interested in reading how the""Harry Potter"" phenomenon got going. There were a few chapters that were very interesting, but some were down right boring. For example: ""advise for a budding writer or H.P websites. I didn't care much for the list of ""other"" authors eitherInteresting reading was about J.K ""Rowlling"" and the back round of the book. I liked reading about the events that have gone on concerning the contests and book readings of the author.On the whole I was disappointed... too much ""other"" boring stuff"
5,Great Magic for Christmas,"I loved the drawings...and am giving this to my grand child for Christmas...He loved Harry, so he will love this!"
3,Cool Clock Except for the Hands,"This is a very cool wall clock if you are a New England Patriots fan. The body of the clock is sturdy and has acrylic like texture. It looks great on the wall. My only complaint is the hands of the clock are cheap plastic and detract from the clock's stylishness. Nevertheless, I'm happy with the clock."
5,You'll listen to this CD year after year!,"I really enjoy Avalon's music, so buying their Christmas CD was a no-brainer. Even though I expected a lot from this CD, it exceeded my expectations. This album has everything from medleys of familiar carols, artistically done, to a very lively and fun ""Winter Wonderland"" to what is destined to be a new Christmas classic ""Don't Save It All For Christmas Day"".I especially love the last track ""We Are the Reason"", which was originally written and recorded by David Meece many years ago. This is an appropriate and very beautiful ending to a fine CD. We ARE the reason that He came into our sinful world, we ARE the reason that he suffered and died.I also recommend Sheila Walsh's new Christmas CD ""Peace: A Celtic Christmas"" and ""One Silent Night"" which has songs sung by different artists such as Ginny Owens and Cindy Morgan.Please check out my reviews of Christian music and books!Merry Christmas!"
2,video,This video was in very poor condition. It is scratched and very frustrating to watch. It skips and stops consistently!
5,Ohhhh yeah . . .,"Wherever You Will Go is THE best song on The Calling's Camino Palmero album. It was their first single, and really broke out well. If you buy this single and like it, you should buy the CD Camino Palmero. You will probably enjoy all the songs on the CD. Wherever You Will Go has a strong guitar melody (strong ACOUSTIC guitar, that is. NOT electric) and extremely insightful and uplifting lyrics."
3,Repetitive,"Bought this for my daughter for X-mas and was slightly disappointed to find that there are only a handful of designs then they repeat several times. Could have been a lot cooler, but for the price, okay."
5,"Bought for kids, but I LOVE them too!","Honestly, bought these for my children, but I have to say, I have personally had a blast coloring with them on these pages! I would recommend them highly if you like coloring with colored pencils. There are many small spaces/lines on each page, so I'm not sure that crayons would do the best job, as compared to colored pencils. Once finished, these are so beautiful, that you can even tear out the page(s) and frame them for hanging - that's what I'm planning to do! Happy coloring!"
4,"fairly easy, very fun","At first I was dissapointed by the relitive simplicity of the designs. this feeling quickly subsided as I came to realize that the simplicity also made it easier to color, harder to mess up on and far more relaxing than say the ""mystic mandalas"" or ""geometrics"" books. if you are at least 10 years old, or are getting a present for someone who is... then I strongly reccomend buying this book. the paper is nice and thick and there are 2 copies of each design in the book, so sharing is a non-issue. if you like art get this book!"
4,When an elderly person has a bit of dementia,"We've been trying to find things to occupy an elderly parent during the day. She reads newspapers and fiction and works a lot of crossword puzzles but hasn't shown any interest in her piano. Someone suggested art and I found this online and ordered with a set of colorful markers. The detail keeps her busy and she enjoys it for about an hour at a time. Gives her more variety in her day, with results she can be proud of. If she uses the markers for more original art work, that would be great but for now this is a welcome addition."
3,Seemed like a good idea.,"I have several students that are interested in Celtic design and thought I would buy this product as incentives for futher study. Since it came in a four pack I thought it would was a wonder find! And, I guess it is, for the price. It was delivered quickly and without problem. The problem comes in the book itself. there are maybe four or five designs that are in the book, and each design is then repeated and repeated to make up the entire book. No originality here. No increasing challenge or surprise. I could have copied the four sheets off of a web site and saved myself the bother. For me this product is just O.K."
3,Cool Designs,"This is a different kind of coloring book. My oldest hasn't lost her interest in coloring at age 13, but she wanted more unique things to color, which is why I bought these. She has really liked them and there are some really cool looking designs in it and they look even better when they are colored. The are detailed, however, and require a lot of time. My daughter works on it for a half hour or so, and comes back to it later."
5,Great for the price,I bought this stuffed lamb for a 2-year-old's birthday party. I included it with some books. The mother later commented on how soft it is and how much her daughter loves the lamb.
4,Lamby,"This lamb is my little girl's ""Lamby."" It is her lovey, and as all parent's can tell you, we could not live without it. It's cute and cuddly and the perfect first toy, except for one flaw. We bought 3 because her first one was worn terribly and repaired several times in the first two years. I was not replaced sooner only due to that it took me that long to find these. When I say repaired, the ones we bought just a month or so ago, has already been sewn on twice (I have the rest stored for when the first of the three wears out). My girl is very careful with Lamby, but she does take it everywhere, and I would have preferred something just a little more durable. The good news is it sews up great (always along the seam) and I can throw it in the washer if it gets too dirty. Overall, I'd say great investment because our girl loves it and is learning how to cope with all kinds of new things because of having a lovey."
5,"a quality product, inexplicably discontinued","In 2003 Sanford began marketing Metallic Sharpie markers in gold, silver, copper, and bronze. Within a few months all but the silver were discontinued. The gold Sharpies admittedly didn't work quite as well as the silver ones, but they were still quite good, and I don't understand why Sanford discontinued them. You can still get gold Sharpie paint markers from Sanford, but they're not the same thing (and they're much more expensive)."
3,What can I say?,"I bought this for my wife, and she likes it. It's a little bit transparent so if it gets dirty from the inside you can notice this from the outside."
1,Biased and Insincere,"The author demonizes the Serbs while victimizing the Croatians and Bosnians. But what about the Croatians and Bosnians killing and raping Serbs? Here is a link to an official UN document illustrating how the Croatians and Bosnians were at least as brutish as the Serbs:(...)This is a PUBLIC document. You can obtain it by calling U.N. Public Inquiry Office at (212) 963-4475.

1,Don't waist you time and money.,Cheap! Don't waist you time and money. These grease zerts are not tapered thus they screw all-the-way into the fitting and are not tight. The threads are not machined to high tolerances. This lets the grease to come out around the threads where they screw into the fitting. They look like a bargain but you get what you pay for. I couldn't get any of them to work in any equipment from a hay bailer to my grandson's China made go cart. I purchase both the ASE & metric.
4,decent,"This grinder works well. Overall craftsmanship is definitely lacking, Made In China is cast on the side, while grinding meat it sounded as if there were parts grinding however i do not believe they actually were. I am very curious as to the quality of the metal used in this grinder and wether or not it is safe for food use... as the other people wrote in their reviews which was true, the non stainless steel parts rust FAST, i suggest washing the parts and oiling with a food grade oil or just vege oil after washing... overall it ground the meat i put through it quite well..."
3,I remember.....,"Some of my fondest memories are of my dad grinding up deer and hogs when I was a kid. I remember getting to turn the crank and ""help"".. That was 35 years ago, ours always rusted too, but ya had to do it like an old black iron skillet and OIL it. Not WD40 or nothing, foodsafe, edible oil. Take care of it and it will last your grandchildren, if ya want one that is perfect and runs like a city folk grinder. They are about 500$, so run and fetch it . Course, Daddy's don't say ""china"" on the side of it neither by God."
3,"Great Picture, No Digital Outputs for Dolby & DTS","Great picture, plays everything I put in it. I can't believe there's no digital output on an HD set. This would be 5 stars with that one feature. I have never seen a DVD player without digital out, which makes me wonder about the quality of the DVD player. The speakers sound a little high pitch, but not too bad. For the money, not a bad deal. Amazon.com ships free and I got it in about three days in California. Go with the free shipping. What a deal."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I tried this TV out the first night I got it and the V-Chip decided on its own to lock out a few channels. Customer service could not help me. They authorized a return to the Chino CA warehouse. It cost me $38.00 to send it to them. A MONTH LATER I got the replacement only after repeated calls to customer service over the delays, and run-arounds with customer service supervisors (customer service is itself a treat with this company -NOT!). As soon as I tried out this replacement TV, it also started to lock out various channels on its own. It will lock out a channel at random for 15 to 60 minutes all on its own. Customer service does not call me back . Don't waste your money."
1,Do not buy - Terrible product,"This unit has several problems, and the manufacturer has apparently gone out of business. I purchased this back in 2004, and it began acting strange soon after. The AC adapter started making a high-piched squeal, the DVD player stopped accepting disks, the content locks started engaging by themselves, blocking out certain channels with cartoons, etc. I could go on, but really, why bother? Trust me, and just don't buy it."
4,Mozart's Party Music,"A nice recording of Mozart's often neglected music for entertainment. The short German dances were composed early in 1791, during the last year of the composer's remarkable life, while the Haffner serenade was performed at a wedding in the fateful month of July 1776 when Mozart, at age 20, had already been recognized as a gifted composer and violinist. This piece is a bit lighter than some of his other serenades, especially the symphonic ""Posthorn"" composed three years later, but it is a wonderfully textured and enjoyable composition that any Mozart fan will appreciate."
4,"Very good, could be better","Pros: Lots of space for practicing writing characters. Includes small tips on writing each character (e.g., this stroke should be longer than that one). Shows you the Traditional version of each character, though it doesn't teach it. A lot of immersion by exposing you to vocabulary you haven't learned yet.Cons: I wish the quizzes were more extensive, especially the chapter reviews. They mostly test you on the pinyin rather than giving you practice writing the characters in the context of a sentence. I would like to see more dictation-style practice. I would also like more practice reading the characters without the aid of pinyin.Other comments: It doesn't really teach any grammar, although it doesn't purport to. For just learning characters, this is a good book. I am progressing quickly with this book, although I studied Chinese for a year in college and I also grew up with spoken Cantonese in the home, which helps a LOT, even though this book teaches Mandarin."
5,"Simple, explanative, easy and FUN.","Mr.Lee does a fantastic job of clear, simple language education. He builds on the previous knowledge piece by piece and yet even a more advanced student will find gems in the early stages.The components of each pictogram are explained logically and then associated in various phrases and sentences to put them in context.I myself have studied Mandarin before but I read every single page of this book starting with first page as the method of explanation was so fun and easy. Before, I was writing characters without understanding their components and knowing them as stand-alone words without a context. Not anymore! Thank you Mr.Lee!!! I am going to read the second book and am hoping Tuttle will publish a third!"
2,250 characters is not enough for every day use,"If you've attended any years of Chinese school, then this book is not for you. I purchased this book to be a refresher and I forgot that 250 characters is a very small number of words. I flipped through the book and realized that I knew most of them already. This book is appropriate if you are a newbie to the Chinese language."
3,What a wondfull book for morden Architectors!,This is nice book for a geometrical design of morden architect
3,Entertaining but poor lesson.,"I read this book with my three year old. The pictures are bright and look just like the characters on t.v. The storyline is entertaining, however I found that it tends to teach your child to give up if you can't do it right and to stick to something you know. I love the Big Comfy Couch but would prefer a story that encourages Loonette to keep trying."
4,"So-so hood, but this lens really needs it..","Canon EF 35mm F/2 lens glares easily from the stray sun rays, so a hood is necessary.PROS:* Easy to attach and detach (Snaps on, no need to align the dots).CONS:* Unlike screw-on hoods, the attachement to the lens is wobbly and doesn't feel solid.* Not large enough to protect from all the glares. Occasionally, I have to use my hand or a baseball cap as an improvised hood extesion."
4,Lens hood is must have - however may want to look at another brand for price,I do close up of the kids and just for the protection a lens hood is a must have. This one goes on and off easily and is very sturdy despite being the snap-on type and not screw-on. Maybe not best bang for the buck (-1 star) but otherwise is great.
5,Canon EW65II Lens Hood Review,"I been using this hood for about 3 weeks now. It looks great on the 40D. It does it's job well... although, I mainly bought it for the look factor. =)"
3,save your money,"I love Rosle products, and thought this would be a good addition. It is a good brush, but it's a little too stiff for washing all things, and definitely too much so for non-stick pans, etc. It looks nice in the kitchen, and you can buy replacement brush heads. I just think it's not that special."
5,Lasts for years,"I was tired of having to replace cheap dish brush heads, they never seem to last me more than a few months. Then I remembered that my parents received one of these for Christmas over six years ago and it still was in great shape and worked just as well as it had new. I initially balked at the price but since having purchased my own I have been just as pleased. Highly recommend"
1,"Ugly, uninspired gameplay, and terrible.","Do not make the mistake of buying this game. The graphics are terrible. They look bad, even if they were on a playstation. Then you get to the controls. Its very easy to learn, so easy you will have trouble losing. There is no challenge in this game. Overall, I can't say anything good about this. You could find a better bike racing game on every system that makes this look bad."
5,Fun tatting book,"This is a fun book and it is a very nice size to carry (half-sheet). The patterns are written in the visual style, and the key in the book makes them quite easy to follow. They progress from quite easy to moderately challenging, so there is something for all levels of tatters. I know several tatters that have taken the challenge to tat all 24."
1,Irritating,"Text is good (which you can find in Wikipedia)...Questions are completely irrelevant...very irritating...some times you'll question yourself ""Am I answering a history paper or a math book?""Extremely bad questioning!!!I think there are better books than this one!"
3,Way to expensive for a cheap plastic thing!,"I ended up buying this to replace the original eyecup that broke after a few removals. I used my camera without it for several months and now that I have it on again I see that this piece does makes a difference, but 12 bucks for a plastic piece that break so easily is outrageous.If you ended up breaking yours as I did, I definitely recommend you to buy it since it makes so much comfortable to use your camera, but my first recommendation is not to remove it, there is no good reason to take it of and risk breaking it."
4,It works,"What can I say. This is the replacement eyecup for a canon rebel. Like the original it has plastic retainer clips which often break and cause you to lose your eyecup.The price is right, its a snap to stick on."
4,2 eyes 1 cup,"There isn't much else to say about this thing. It's the same thing that came with your Digital Rebel XT or XTi. Nothing more, nothing less."
3,Key word: LOST,"Like socks out of laundry, so are eye cups to my XTi. The piece is fine, it is the design that allows for constant unintentional detachment.Now on my 5th replacement, and over $60 invested I am looking to glue my next one as the only alternative as Canon has not done a good job on the plastic attachment clips."
3,Could be a little bigger,"Does the job as expected. Could be a little bigger. Still have a tendency to aim too high. Priced right for a test to see if it will work for you,"
3,Eyecup- not extended,Mistakenly thought this was an eyecup extension to assist with glasses. This is only a replacement of the original eyecup trim.
4,Just like the one I lost,These eye pieces pop off a DSLR easily so it was good that I was able to easily get this inexpensive replacement one.
2,Great accessory - poor attachment method,"I've ordered two of these for my Canon T3i and it's an advantage to have on my camera. It makes using the view finder more comfortable. I gave the item only 2 stars because it slips off too easily. Nothing broke, they just came off. I was fortunate to find the missing piece twice, but on my last outing, the rubber piece was lost again. The piece will slip off from the camera body just rubbing against my side when I have the camera strap over my shoulder, or from the camera rubbing against my camera bag when I'm removing it for use. I'm very disappointed that Canon hasn't figured out a more secure attachment method. I will order a third replacement, but this time I'll use a little glue to hold it on. I don't like putting glue on my camera body, but I don't know any other way to make sure it's permanently secured."
4,It works.,SO this should be a fairly simple review.+ Fits my Rebel XT just like it says it does.+ seems sturdy never had one break- Falls off easily. I'm not sure if this is the eye cup or the way its attached to the camera. But still its annoying to have to replace it cause it falled off.
3,Overpriced,The cards are fine and I understand compiling trivia cards is labor intensive and hence apt to becostly. But with all previous purchases of trivia sets there have been two boxes of questions.THis has only one which makes the almost $50 (including shipping) price beyond reasonable.
2,pretty boring,"I have about a million Dover books on needlework and design and this is one of my least favorite. See the Images above for why. Kinda boring. The only thing to recommend this book is that the stencils are on thick card paper and one side each. (It's funny: when you open up the book, you only see blank pages because each side of pages with the stencils face each other.) I've gotten no use from this book and will be giving it away."
3,not my favorite broadway,It is a shame this DVD never reaches the high level of the first DVD.This one is absolutely not as lavish as its big sister.
2,What did they do to Broadway?,"The musical arrangements used in this show are horrible. It's not the Broadway I love. The predecessor to this show, ""The Leading Ladies"" is much better, though still not exceptional."
2,Pretty Rough!,"What a missed opportunity. Opening, awful, Julie Andrews' clothes, dreadful, Nathan Lane wasted, even the sometimes wonderful Linda Eder is well below par. And as for Michael Crawford, words almost fail me.But not quite!He is, quite simply, awesomely UNtalented, not to mention downright strange, with all the stage technique of a gibbon and the charisma of a stoat. Praises go to Adam Pascal and that wonderful choir, but as for the rest, avoid."
1,LOVE SONGS,"The woman cannot sing, she is trying to sound like striesand and there is only one person that even comes close and that is Barbara herself. Stop trying to be something your NOT !"
5,Amazing,"Rarely does something come along that makes the Christmas story new and fresh for those of us who have grown up in the church. When this first came out, I somehow ended up with a free version of the CD. I was hooked immediately. I purchased tickets to see the show and was in tears when it was over.An all star compiliation of stars, from Richard Marx and Michael Crawford, to Michael W. Smith and Avalon-this CD is incredible, second only to the live show itself. The talent put together to make this was second to none and the results are phenominal.This is a must have CD, and not just for Christmas. Since the original CD I owned has been lost, I am purchasing it again which tells you....it's awesome!"
4,A babyshower by the father for the son,"I really enjoyed this CD...of course, the birth of Christ is a time for rejoicing...but it often seems so stiff and formal. In regular families a new baby is a joyful laughing occasion...babies are messy and everyone reacts differently according to age, position and personality. This seems to bring the laughter and warmth back into the story; that makes it endearing and delightful."
1,An astonishing thesis that disregards the music!,"Are we really to believe that the music of this man does not speak for itself? Was it really his ""political connections"" and ""who he knew"" that led to his success in 19th century Vienna? Are there really other Beethovens running around out there who just haven't gotten a break. A nice parlor exercise perhaps, but really.....how about a serious listen to what he actually wrote down! What I am suggesting is a serious listen. Why, for example, does his work seem to have a much higher density of sheer thought (form if you like) than that of any other composer? Why are his thematic constructs so intellectually exhilarating as well as emotionally moving? Why does he exemplify the most startling development of style of almost anyone you can think of in the arts? What is it about his almost extra-material universal appeal? Listen to the music. Maybe the answers are found there."
1,The Pits!,The reasoning in this book is so full of holes that anyone could drive a fleet of Mack trucks right through it. Don't waste your time and money on this book. The other three individuals who also have given this book a single star are so on target. I can't add anything to the excellent points they have already written. This book is amazingly bad.
1,perhaps unintentionally awry,"The author states more than once, in one way or another, that she does not mean to detract from Beethoven's greatness as a creator, but the effect is peculiar nonetheless. As the other reviewer of this book exclaimed, listen to the music! The IMPRESSION the author perhaps inadvertently gives, anyway, is that the world as we know it after Beethoven did his work might have been a world instead impressed by the greatness of Pfart, or whoever that circle of Viennese influencers otherwise settled on. Whereas someone totally unaware of Vienna and its doings would still have taken amazed note of Beethoven, then and since. Some folk are not that enamored of B even now, but they certainly know his power."
4,My Lord Winter,"Lady Jane Brooke, 20, is on her way to London with her abigal Ella and governess Miss Gracechurch. She takes it upon herself to head there for her first season since her mother isnt very interested in her children. After her carriage mishap, they board the mail coach and again encounter another mishap. All of the occupants in the mail coach find themselves near Lord Wintringham's estate and decide to seek shelter there.In order to protect her name is introduces herself as Miss Brooke and Miss Gracechurch whom everyone thinks is an impoverishedgentlewoman. The Earl of Wintringham is intrigued by Lady Brooke but she later learns her deceit might not be forgiven.Fun quick read, true to Regency style of writing, clean romance"
4,GREAT ARMENIAN DANCE PARTY MUSIC,Armenian party and dance music in the finest tradition. Resurrects the Armenian soul to start dancing.
3,not for people looking for professional advice,"this guy is telling the same things over and over, its always like this: i am going to tell you something important! but that will never come, it's just for printing more papers adding to book."
2,"Good for Sophomores, but not for those who have already given graduate school some thought","The target audience of the book is a sophomore or junior year audience. Thos e purchasing the book should be limited to people of that level in their studies or people who are only beginning to consider graduate school. For those who have given grad school a lot of thought: The book is a waste of time. Everything you already know is in there. The chapters have great titles but in the end they told me what I already knew.This book is in no way a complete guide to graduate school admissions. It seemed a bit infantile. But if you feel clueless, go for it."
1,Common Sense,"I felt like I wasted my money purchasing this book. In general, it was mostly just common sense for anyone who is really serious about applying to graduate school - ie talk to professors, talk to grad students, research the programs you are interested in. Basically, it said that if you do not have excellent grades, you need to have other areas of strength. Obviously.I did find some parts of the book to be quite humorous. It was published in 1997 and talked about using the internet to research schools as a novelty. It just shows that the internet is in use much more than it was when the book was published.Additionally, the book was too long (and too expensive for its quantity and quality). The information could have been summarized in 20 pages max.I really wish I had not purchased this book, but at least Amazon allowed me to return it and get my money back.If you are looking for a book about applying to graduate school, I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,A little tinny,"These were purchased for an instrument I'm just playing around with and didn't want to spend a whole lot on. They seem nice enough, but are a little brighter than what I'd prefer if I were gigging with it. There are two little rubber tubes on the A and D string which I'm not sure where they go- I emailed D'Addario for their advice.Basically, I'd recommend these for a student set. They're inexpensive and adequate for learning."
4,Good price.,"This strings are not the best you can buy but are cheap and bring a nice sound combined with a good bridge, good for inicial students."
2,"A predictable ""Fatal Attraction""","This was a disappointing read and I was happy to see it end.I give it 2 stars, rather than 1, because the author did succeed at creating an element of suspense that kept the story moving along at a nice pace.Other than that, though, the characters were flat, the storyline was predictable, and the ending was a quick descent into mediocrity."
2,Not so Thrilling,"THE INTERVIEW ROOM is supposed to be a psychological thriller, but I didn't find it very thrilling.I found all the characters in this novel to be largely flat and difficult to relate to. In particular, the lead character is more like a philosopher than a real person, constantly over-analyzing one situation after another. He's not very admirable, or even that interesting. His marriage is oddly unpleasant, almost leading the reader to hope for a divorce instead of a reconciliation.The plot of THE INTERVIEW ROOM is pretty sluggish at the beginning, then moves into hyperdrive in the last third, with too many implausible events happening all at once. The ending is pretty standard, the type of violent showdown I've read in hundreds of other books of this nature.I do believe Anscombe is a talented writer. Much of the prose in this book was quite strong. But the shortcomings in both plot and characterization make this a difficult book to recommend.Two stars."
4,Truth doesn't have to hurt,"Although I was brought up Catholic, I could never quite buy intoany organized religious doctrine. It was one size fits all and I just didn't fit in. Michelle Whitedove writes with a simplicity and purity that rings true. It reaches the core of my inner self. She illuminates the path to unconditional love not fire and brimstone. Learning to communicate with my spirit guides and angels has profoundly changed my life on many levels. I recommend this book to anyone needing to bring light and love into their lives. Don't we all?"
2,"Great Medium, Not so Great Book","I watched Michelle Whitedove on a TV show about America's top psychics in 2007. She was excellent. She won the competition and I was very happy for her. She is an incredibly talented psychic medium and is full of positive energy. Sadly, she is not as good a writer as she is a psychic, and it appears that she did not make use of a professional editor prior to publishing her book. This is unfortunate, because the grammatical errors weaken her message. However, if you can get past that, the book is full of lots of interesting information and stories. If you like books on psychic mediums, angels, auras,dreams,animal totems, karma and free will, you will find this book to be very interesting."
1,Not believable,"When she said there is no Satan - I had to doubt everything else she said. Also, it's just poorly written. Save your money!"
4,"Not bad, but would go with a 3 tier version","I ordered one of these a while back. Eastman Outdoors makes good jerky products, I have been using them for years. It did work well for me, but I recently found the 3 tier version, also from Eastman Outdoors. Same construction, non-stick but has an exra tier. Im glad I got the bigger one now, I can make more in less time. For a few dollars more, it was worth it. I had no problem with the non-stick, not sure why others did. The construction of it is good, after all, I dont need to stand on it! It holds the meat well in the oven. I left one star off of this item because of its smaller size. Otherwise, its good."
2,poor drying racks for hamburger strip jerky,Made from 14in. hardware cloth and are definitely NOT non-stick. Use vegetable oil spray. Probably will work for drying other items but I wouldn't recommend them for hamburger strip jerky.
3,Canon EW-60C lens hood review,"This lens hood does provide some relief from stray light hitting the lens. Because of the wide angle aspect of the lens it is meant for it is pretty shollow in depth. It also does afford some protection from bumps for the lens as well. The manual focus ring on the 18-55mm lens this hood is meant for is very narrow and difficult to use, grasping the lens hood and using it to focus is a better alternative. Construction of this hood is just a rigid piece of plastic. While a worthwhile product to have it is way overpriced.I have not seen an aftermarket manufacturers hood in person for this lens but it is probably just as good and probably cheaper. I suggest you take a look at one of those before buying if you have a chance."
3,Does not fit easily,This hood does not fit on the EF-S 18-55 mm lens easily. Sometimes I feel as though it might damage the lens. Once on the lens the camera looks nice. Due to the wide angle of the lens the hood is of little use technically. It would have been better if it was fitting easily on the lens.
1,Very Deceiving!,"Ok well, I just got my lens hood today. This is not even a Canon Product, the box says....For Canon. They used an actual product in one of the photos, I guess this is where I was misled. Construction bit poor & I am upset at myself for not looking closer at this product before buying it. If you are actually gonna buy a hood...pay the extra bucks & get the real deal. This product is.....are you ready? CACA! don't waste your money on this. Straight up CACA!"
4,Great Lens Hood!,I bought this lens hood for my Cannon lens (55mm-250mm) and it works great. Highly recommend this product.
2,having a tough time trying to fix the hood to the lens,"i bought the hood for my 18-55 lens. maybe its 'coz i don't know how to attach it to the lens, anyways I am not able to attach it to my lens. I have a hood for my 70-300 mm which I am happy with."
2,Flower Lens Hood Available,Google a 58mm flower lens hood and you'll find there are 'petal' style hoods that actual do what this lens says it will do.
4,"What, no hood?","""I know, let's sell the lens hood separately. We can make killing on selling them separately and just think more wasteful packaging. I love it. Maybe we can even figure out a way to sell the glass as an accessory""."
2,A bit too expensive,"This lens hood can be useful for some special situations as mentioned before. It does help protect certain objects from getting too close to the lens, but doesn't quite protect against flare unless the sun ""cooperates""."
4,Helpful little hood,"Although the hood is small it does reduce glare.PROS. It also helps with manual focusing, making the focus ring bigger and easy to hold.Reduces glare. Helps camera sit even / flat when put down. Further protects yourGlass.CONS. Circular filters are a pain to use. Such as a Polarizer, or any that require spinning to adjust.But that goes with any hood.Pricey, For a little piece of plastic its expensive."
3,Good in a pinch,The quality of the hood is not what I expected. When done attaching it on to my lens there were gaps between the lens and hood. Attachment is faster than other hoods as it attaches to the outer lens instead of using the threads on the lens. It will work good in a pinch. It is compact so it will also work when you don't have a lot room for extra accessories. Fast shipment.
5,My review...,"Product is as stated, a lens hood. Nothing too special. Fits lens well, Reverses and again fits lens well. Hasnt cracked anywhere since the 1.5 years of owning it"
1,Useless,"Completely useless. It BARELY extends past the lens, and if you have a filter on it's even worse. It will not only NOT stop any lens flare, it seems to have no function at all. Save your money."
1,don't bother,"way too expensive (I got a used one, so the damage was not so bad). provides little function. you can do a lot better shading the lens with the back of your hand."
3,Good lens hood,"This is a good, perfect fiting lens hood. It should come with the lens as Canon lens are costly.I wish it were a little longer. Its not made by Canon & you can find the same product under another brand name for less money."
2,A bit clumsy and pricy,"I bought it for my 18-55 EF-S, and it looks like it is not very efficient - but I guess it is normal for a 18mm (x 1.6). I would have prefered a ""tulip"" design like those of Sigma."
3,Too expensive and a little hard to install,"This simple lens hood appears to be well made and durable, and it's designed for the lens that I'm using (the kit lens). However, the over $20 price seems very high for the simple design and construction of this product. The tolerances are very close, and I was able to install it properly after several minutes of struggle, being afraid to exert much force for fear of breaking something."
5,Overpriced,"It's overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it does have one thing that the cheaper non-authentic versions don't: felt on the inside. The felt helps to scatter and absorb light, thus improving the function the hood was designed for. Of course, the felt is not worth this much money either, and you could just cut your own and line it on the inside of the cheaper versions to the same effect. However, when I buy a lens, I just factor the cost of the hood and filters into the cost of the lens before I make my purchase, so I have already accepted the high price. Price aside, it's a great hood that meets expectations perfectly."
4,Slide switch for serious dictators,"Microcassette portable dictating machines all have a single slide switch for Record/Stop/Playback/Rewind. Long experience has shown that is the best control mechanism for actually doing dictation vs. recording something. Most of the Sony and other brand portable flash-based recorders have buttons scattered all over them, making dictation a real pain. This model is the rare exception. It's not built quite as much like a tank as traditional microcassette units but it's lots more rugged than most of Sony's and other brand's ""consumer"" recorders. My major complaint is that the ""insert"" function is not as easy to get to as it should be, considering that is one of the most important features of a flash-based dictating machine."
1,Terrible functionality - no mac compatability.,"I just bought this Sony ICD-BM1 and I am very unhappy with it. First off, there's no way to write-protect your messages. Once you record something, it's very easy to accidentally record over it. You can't save or lock or protect your recordings! This is a major problem because of the slide switch. All you have to do is accidentally push past stop and you'll start recording over your message.I recorded something last night and one of my coworkers accidentally recorded over part of it just now!!! Infuriating! Now you just hear me screaming ""no, no, no!"" as I'm trying to stop the damage.There's also no pause or hold feature to prevent you from accidentally turning the recorder on and killing your batteries. The off/on toggle can very easily be switched on in your bag.At this price level, you'd expect better features from a brand like Sony. Shame on them. I'm furious with them and hope I can return it.DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC!!!!"
1,Nice but not durable,This is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours (but did make it beyond the very short warrenty). It was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long. For the price I expected a durable and well built machine. I was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it.
2,Great Quality Recordings - but completely incompatible with macs,"What's annoying about this solid recorder is that Sony hasn't elected to make it compatible with mac. It records in a proprietary format which you can't convert out of (or even play) in mac, and it's not exactly easy to convert out of the msw format in windows either (requiring multiple different downloads, or an initial conversion to aiff with the provided software). For a while I had to run virtual pc to get my recordings - and that is just way too much hassle.I used to love Sony's products, but now, I just wish they would work with other technologies in my workstream (Sony should look to how apple learned its lesson with interoperability)."
2,Worked like it was supposed to,This lens cap made for the lens and was exact in fit and snapping into place. I wished this was priced lower but went the extra distance because another I bought that cost less did not work at all. It would not stay on.
3,Ew75II Lens Hood: Expensive But Necessary,"The Canon Ew75-II Lens Hood is an expensive but necessary addition to shooting with Canon 20mm f2.8 EF wide angle lens. The hood is made of plastic and features a felt-like, reflection dampening interior. It really cuts down on flare and adds a minimal amount of protection to the large front element of the lens. The hood attaches by a bayonet style mount but is difficult to keep firmly attached. I use a small piece of gaffers tape to keep it from rotating on the lens. Overall it feels cheap for the price. I would expect Canon to charge significantly less for something of this quality or include it with the lens purchase. It serves it's purpose but I will most likely look at third party options if I need to purchase another one."
3,Not bad... Not amazing.,"Well, I bought this one and it looks nice... It is pretty comfortable. However... The other guy who wrote a review is right. It has a tendancy to grab lil bits of lint. The outter fabric is sorta like static charged corderoy (sp check?). For $200 bucks, its decent. Be prepared to wait a month. It also gets fairly hot. Good for winter I suppose."
1,Couldn't get through it,"A book about storytelling that was not well told. Although this one came highly recommended, I was personally put offby the fact that it was dryly written and not that engaging. When a book reads like a textbook and becomes a chore to get through,I put it down."
3,Go directly to the end of each chapter,"This is a very scholarly book that really sheds light what it's like to be a business leader. Then Denning shows how storytelling can be part of an effective leadership tool box.Each chapter ends with a couple of pages of great instruction--how to craft and deliver the story that chapter was devoted to. I found the table on page 18 to be a helpful overview of the eight types of stories, their uses and what reactions they should elicit from the audience.However, business speakers who want to add stories to their presentations TODAY need to work with a presentation coach. In much less time, and with much more fun, your coach will get you to actually be a storyteller, not just think about telling stories."
1,Too Much Fluff,"The author has some good information that could have been communicated in 75 pages, but he chose to bury the valuable nuggets in an ocean of words and self congratuatory hype. Don't bother with this book."
1,Not worth your time,Poorly written with no condensed meaning.Stories in the book are not attractive nor luminenting.It is a waste of time readers authors and anyone engaged.
4,Good Info,"I have the Breed All About it VHS, I thought it was rather good. If they say the DVD is 30 mins long and it's actually 23 mins this is miss leading, They didn't design the Breed All About series to cover EVERY SINGLE little detail. It's just a brief view of various breeds, if someone wants in depth detail contact a GOOD Doberman breeder."
2,Don't start with this...,"I picked this up on CD after I listened to the band's earlier releases, ""The Raincoats"",""Odyshape"",""Moving"" and ""The Kitchen Tapes""; it didn't impress me. Note the absence of Vicky Aspinell, who I feel was an essential part of the Raincoats in their early years. The gal's voices don't sound as great as they did on their previous albums. Gina's voice grated on my nerves after the first track. The last two tracks are from back in the day. Raincoats' classics! I would say, pick this one up after you have listened to their earlier releases. Maybe then you'll share a similar opinion!"
4,"Complete, concise and very helpful to those considering FC.","Getting Started in Financial Consulting by Edward J. Stone is a well written description of what you need to do for a career in Financial Counseling. It is well organized, complete and provides inside information on what it takes to get started, run a business, and be a successful Finanacial Counselor. The review of the various certification programs is quite extensive. This book can be considered the bible in not only in getting started in Financial Counseling, but in making it a career. It is also helpful for present Financial Counselors to use as a benchmark to measure up to Mr. Stone's high standards that are essentially required in this profession. Follow his guidelines and you will be successful over the long term. A must read if you are considering going into Financial Counseling."
2,"Pick another book to ""Get Started with""",The author Edward Stone did nothing for this book but interview a bunch of different financial consultants then write this book. Shouldn't an author of a book know what he is writing about? Find a book written by a financial consultant. The writing style was incredibly boring and I had a hard time finishing this book. This book did very little to educate me on getting ready to be a financial consultant.
2,Not the Ray I knew,"I'm sorta at a loss with this concert. First off, the sound is only dolby 2.0 ... not what I was expecting for a DVD released this recently. Secondly, Ray seems a little out of it ... I had to strain to hear the words to several of the songs. I found several of the songs simply boring. Don't get me wrong .. I'm a huge fan of Ray. This concert just left me ... well ... blah."
3,"A great artist, but the concert is a bit too bland for me.","I sort of agree with the reviewer who was forced to use the word ""blah."" The musical numbers aren't those I'd prefer to see/hear again. Even the version of ""Georgia"" is a bit bland. The CD from the film ""Ray"" is great, by the way - it has a lot of great Ray Charles - the original recordings. I'm also looking forward to another DVD of Ray Charles that I bought - haven't seen that yet, though."
4,He Can't Be Topped,"Ray Charles is one of the few music personalities that lives up to the word, phenomenon! He doesn't perform a song he doesn't feel, and it is contagious. I found myself captivated by this performance. The highlight for me,was when Ray picks up a cold Alto Saxophone on the song, ""All I Ever Need Is You,""and plays a wonderful solo. He is truly, a ""natural."" Be it blues,country,rock and roll,jazz,standards or gospel, Ray's infectious enthusiasm and natural ability, make the songs his own. Buy it, you will love it!!!"
2,Don't bother,"Some people have complained that the sound is turned down too much on this DVD. After watching it, I wonder if they did it on purpose.Ray Charles is in great spirits at this concert but certainly not in great voice.The orchestra is great and Ray could certainly still play the piano just fine but his singing is pretty bad.Diane Shur, who guest stars on two songs is very good but if you're going to get this DVD for her, you might as well get her own DVD.Anyway, get some other Ray Charles DVD instead."
1,Ray Charles-In Concert,"I have always admired Ray Charles, but his performance here was far less than satisfactory. For example, when he sang, the words were slurred so bad that unless you knew the song, you had no idea what he was saying. The entire DVD was like this. I couldn't help but wonder if he was stoned during his performance.I sent it back and purchased a different DVD of a different artist."
4,Well written history of affimative action at Boalt,"Guerrero provides both a well-written account of the rise and fall of affirmative action at Boalt Hall, and an articulate argument for the merits, especially in law school, of affirmative action. Her writing eschews ideological hyperbole and throughout remains grounded in the real issues affecting the greater population by a lack of diversity in law schools and the law community at large. Even those who disagree with affirmative action will find this book of interest for the readable account of, and insight into, the students of Boalt Hall who felt compelled to fight for their beliefs."
5,Kubrick's genius,"I'm reviewing the films, not the package -- though I did buy this collection because it addresses some aspect-ratio issues that had gone unresolved before.I'll just say this: Stanley Kubrick is, in my opinion, the greatest filmmaker in the history of cinema. Even ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" his last movie, has grown in stature tremendously since I first saw it and felt rather disappointed. That's Kubrick, though -- he's like the poet of filmmaking. You can't read a great poem one time and fully understand it, and it's the same with almost any Kubrick film: You have to see it several times to get it all."
1,Full Metal Jacket corrupted disk,"Review only for disc Full Metal Jacket , I was enjoying watching one of the greatest Kubrick's movie, then suddenly the picture start to freeze after an hour play, the disc is not scratched or you can not see any damage, just it want play further, i think it is factory problem, buyers be aware you might run on same problem ...I am very disappointed"
5,Amazing box set!,"If you are a Kubrick fan, then buy this set! All his best and most memorable films are here and the bonus discs for each movie are incredible. Especially the Shining bonus disc. Not to mention the very well done documentary on Kubrick's life. I never get tired of watching this collection. Malcolm Mcdowell's audio commentary on A Clockwork Orange is very interesting. He tells little stories and rare facts about the filming and what went on. It's also nice to see these films presented in the original theatrical aspect ratio. They look fantastic. The Clockwork Orange widescreen laser disc released 12 years ago fell short. This DVD presentation is how it should look. Warner could of done a better job boxing up the set instead of the half assed flimsy cardboard casing. They also should of included the slip cases with the poster art that are on each movie if you buy them individual. But...whatever. Other than that it's great."
3,"Great Director, Bad Packaging","The group of movies is great, but the packaging is cheap and flimsy. I would have thought that they would have at least used thicker cardboard."
3,Beware of the staging,I will make no comment on the music and singing (see one of the excellent books on that). I review this only to warn you of the absurd staging that does its best to ruin this beautiful opera. The dances especially are almost comical due to the attempt to modernize what is already a timely and timeless work of art.
4,WoW! What a film!,After viewing this video I was amazed! I never knew history could be portrayed So well in a movie. I thought the actors were incredible! The scenery of Chile was beautiful! I would recommend this film to anyone. The plot was good but at times hard to follow because of the sub-titles. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in history or just a good movie!
4,Awesome for all Rosie Fans!,"I very much enjoyed this book. But be prepared, it's not a biography on Rosie. It's more of a biography of Rosie's show. So... if you enjoy her show - you'll LOVE this book."
1,Rosie still has fans?,"People still enjoy this woman and books written about her? She is a disgusting fat pig with very little talent. This book exemplifies her ""wonderful"" qualities. Did I mention she's a hypocrite?"
4,Excellent sound production and mechanically reliable,After my first changer kept malfunctioning I was extremely concerned about buying a changer that would hold up. Moreover I did not want to sacrifice on sound. This changer is more than satisfactory on both counts.
1,Too expensive,"This lens hood is a must if you are serious about macro photography with you 100mm f/2.8. I cannot praise the lens high enough, but that is no reason why Canon should rip us off, asking $40 for a piece of cheap plastic!! Why don't they follow Nikon's example and start shipping their lenses with hoods. After all, good and pricey lenses are for people who are serious about photography, and people who are serious about photography want to have hoods on their lenses!! So Canon, stop being greedy...I give it a rating of 1/5 simply because the quality/price ratio is terrible."
4,"Overpriced, but genuine Canon build","Should have come with the lens, but then, the lens would simply have had a higher price, right?"
4,"pricey, but works well",I agree with the other reviewer- pricey for an extension cord- but it works well. My only 2 cents to add is that it can be tough to get the plugs lined up just right with the camera and remote shutter- especially in the dark.
3,Less useful,I use it rarely. This is not a good product to use. Instead I recommend using a wireless remote like pocket wizard. This is not a good product to use except long exposure.
1,All crap all the time,"Poorly written with difficult to follow instructions that involve poor techniques and designs.Possession of items described as parts in this book and/or making items described within without first obtaining permission from the Federal and State governments are felony crimes punishable by $10,000+ fines and 10+ years in prison. You can ask the author he spent years in prison himself.There are better books available if the study of this topic interests you."
4,Nice Book but.....,"I was a psychology major in college but never talked about Freud's use & work with cocaine in any of my classes, so I am extremely interested in this book & what it has to say. My only complaint is that they said it was in very good condition whereas when I opened it today I would say it is in good condition, not very good..Anyhow, it was printed in 1974 & has been through many hands no-doubt so I'm still quite pleased to own it now, however I'm not quite sure I would have paid as high a price as I did knowing the quality I actually received."
1,Pay money to get cut up,"The so called knife defenses in this book are terrible. Tedeschi's other books are fairly good, but this one is the worst of the type I have ever read. The knife work will get you killed. There is no way this stuff would work against anyone with any knife skill whatso-ever. If you have seen Jim Carry's ""you've attacked me wrong"" skit from 'In Living Color' you have some idea of how useless this book is.The other weapons are ok, but the knife stuff just brings the whole book down to not worth keeping."
1,worse than bad,"I ordered this because I like old orignal music. I ordered this because it averaged 5 stars (I'm assuming the producer of this cd and his parents wrote the 3 strong reviews). I didn't think I could go wrong. Well, I went wrong. This tape is a compliation of dreadful songs. (I assume no royalties had to be paid on flops). I tossed the tape in the trash bin after listening to it twice. (I gave it another whirl, hoping it wasn't as bad as I thought.The second time around was worse than the first.) This is so bad (my company agreed) that I wouldn't even donate this to the Salvation Army (which I normally do before tossing someone ""good"" in the trash bin). I question (I may be wrong) if these were ever hits. Lyrics, rhythm, beat ... none of these songs worked. Not one. I'd given it 0 stars if that was an option."
3,How would I know what to say about it?,"I ordered these for my Dad's Christmas gift. This is his style of music, not mine. I hope he likes it."
5,Hits of the 1940s,This was purchased for someone that likes to sing the oldies. He has played daily and it works well. thanks
3,received in poor condition,"Planned to use as a gift, but arrived damaged. (crushed plastic carrier and warped). Was pleased to receive a replacement but it was too late to be used as a Christmas gift. The music wasn't quite what I had hoped for, but your service was fine. Thanks"

5,Amazing Margaritas - watch out!,"We used this for margaritas - the bottle comes with a recipes. They are pricey little drinks when you add all the suggested spirits, but for a very special occasion they are worth it. Not too sweet but may go down a bit too easy, so watch out. This is by far the best margarita we've ever made."
5,This is the one!,"Forget any other book (and believe me I went through a lot of them)!G. Neuman helps you in very warm and positive way (and isn't what you need right now?), to understand the development stages your children are at, how divorce can affect them and most important how to help them. I have 3 children and it was so important for me to go to what is specific to their ages. I love all the little tools you can use to see where your child is at."
4,helping children of divorce,"This book is geared to divorced parents but there is information that is helpful for counselors and therapists as well. Some of the activities can be used by therapists in counseling sessions with children and their parents.Other helpful books for mental health professionals working with children of divorce include:Creative Interventions for Children of DivorceComplete Group Counseling Program for Children of Divorce: Ready-To-Use Plans & Materials for Small & Large Groups, Grades 1-6"
5,Great for parents of children of all ages,This book covers what kids are feeling/thinking/experiecing as their parents go through divorce/separation. Its great for parents to read regarding their childrens behavior during this time. No matter what age your child/ren are this book covers it. It truelly makes understanding the harships of divorce on kids a little easier. a MUST read for all parents going through separation or divorce. an EAXCELLENT book.
1,Helping Your Kids Cope with Divorce the Sandcastles Way,Not great but it good be helpful if you have kids not expresing their emotion.Not for me I prefered The Truth About Children and Divorce: Dealing with the Emotions So You and Your Children Can Thrive.
1,this book is trash,the section on toddlers is written entirely from the female perspective assuming that the female actually cares and gets the child.I am a father and have custody and think that this book is garbage for all those dads out there that have their loved one.
4,Divorce Poison,Very useful and the book revealed lots of common mistakes tat easily overlooked. I gave the book to my boyfriend as gift as he is experiencing the nightmares wif his ex n son..
5,Fun with Computer Electronics by Luann Colombo,"This is an excellent book on the workings of electricity.For instance, it explains how rubber, plastics and glassare poor conductors and good insulators. The workings ofelectrical flow are explained as well as the materials sciencein a silicon chip. Each piece of hardware is explainedmethodically. i.e. MONITOR, RAM, CPU, MODEM, ROMA beauty of the work is that it shows how to assemble acomputer-from scratch. It starts with inserting springs ,light emitting diodes, resistors, capacitors, the piezotransducer, energy changers, chips and the battery power unit.This book is perfect for high school science projects.Mid-way through the book, the author explains how to organizea schematic. The various gates are explained. i.e. AND, OR,NAND etc. A beauty of this book is that it is easy to read andunderstand."
4,No glasses fogging,"No more glasses fogging up with this adjustment lens. Be certain to purchase the rubber Eb frame otherwise it will not fit on the camera. The eye piece extender can also be used with this adjustment lens. Hence no fogging on the glasses and no nose/cheek prints on the LCD.Also I recommend doing the dioptric adjust on the camera before mounting to the lens extender if you decide to use the extender along with the dioptric adjustment. (The focal points are clearer and easier to see pre-lens extender.The order of mounting is rubber frame to dioptric adjustment and then these two pieces to the eye extender and then mounted to the camera. (from the camera body extended, dioptric adjustment, Eb rubber frame)"
2,"Lots of potential, but zero follow through...","This tale of three close friends heading on vacation to celebrate one of their upcoming nuptials started out with a lot of potential. Each of the main characters brings her own set of issues to the table (Rachel - her overbearing future mother-in-law, Yaslyn - her dwindling modelling career and Carrie Ann - her recent divorce). Add to that fellow tourists, Marcus and Sally, who seem to be suffering some marital ""blahs"" and a cast of vacation representatives from all walks of life and this story should be unstoppable. Right? Unfortunately, no...All of the intrigue that has the potential to create a page turner either never happens or shows up so late in the story that it's rushed and ineffective. It was really disappointing to me because the characters themselves are very enjoyable and deserved much better action that what they were given.As beach reads go, I'd leave this one in the dunes..."
5,Uplifting and patriotic,"The finely detailed illustrations are a perfect match for the positive and informative text of this book. It is a primer on patriotism, full of fondness for America.This is an incredibly well-done book.""Strong and free, we will continue to be an inspiration to the world.""Check out the notes section -- thorough!"
3,Left wing anti-semites don't read this,Why is it that outside Savage and Coulter it is the lefties among us that use the most intemperate language. The absurdity of an anti-semite calling a reasoned intelligent woman like Ms. Cheney a Nazi is laughable. Take a look in the mirror pal
1,Oops!,"I is for I love you 'cause I have to, America.Give the kids real books, please. Leave the brainwashing for the older folks."
5,Beautiful Book!,This is a beautiful book and appropriate for all ages. The writing is heartfelt and the illustrations are moving. Each time my grandson and I pick up this book we find something new that he has questions that open up a wonderful discussion between us. This is a must have book for every family's library!
5,All proceeds to the Red Cross,"If you look on the back of the book, you'll see that Mrs. Cheney is donating her proceeds to charity. As a democrat from Florida,I was interested to know that. I was really angry about how the election was taken from us, but after I was given this marvelous book for my children, and told by a friend to give it a chance, I was bowled over. There is so much life and joy in this book, it made me want to get it for everyone in my school."
5,Cuddling,"The illustrations of AMERICA: A PATRIOTIC PRIMER are quite exceptional. The messages of patriotism and history are especially poignant now, when our country is in such danger.Nonetheless, I liked something else that's best about this book, and that's the experience it triggers. Sitting with a child on your side, or better on your lap, reading this book produces a unique kind of closeness.Together, you're identifying the illustrations. Together, you're reading the words. Together, you're learning American history. And, if you're lucky, together, you're experiencing how wonderful it is to be an American.So I guess I'd recommend the book to those who want to: a) get closer to their child and b) have that child learn why being an American is such a joy.If you aren't interested in these two, get another book.If you are, though, AMERICA's for you."
1,B is for Blind Patriotism,"This is a book that will NOT be added to my niece's bookshelf. It is a book that refuses to see our history as multi-faceted, rather, relying on blind patriotism and unquestioning loyalty, which is the underlying current of the book--that anyone who wants to change this country for the better, isn't a 'good' American.I find it rather insulting that Lynne Cheney, one of the most outspoken advocates of the pro-censorship movement, could pen such a work extolling the same freedoms she wants to restrict.I want all children to be proud of America, but not as the perfect country, but as a grand experiment continuously in prgress.The final indignity being 'N for Native Americans', since we all know that systematic genocide was practiced upon them. Does Mrs. Cheney want our children to be proud of THAT?"
1,Yawn. Yawn. Yawn.,"One thing about this book is beyond reasonable dispute: it is boring. Remember your Civics class? This is worse. I cannot imagine any intelligent child finding this book of any interest whatsoever. (I can imagine brain dead relatives inflicting it on nieces, nephews, grandchildren, and god children in an effort to correct perceived flaws in upbringing. Please don't!)"
1,America A Political Correct Patriotic Primer,"If I wanted to indoctrinate my child into ""political correctness"" I would buy this book and read it to them nightly.As an amateur historian, I found it to be historically inaccurate stating that Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freed African-Americans in the Confederacy. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free any slave anywhere. Lincoln had no authority in the Confederacy and he had no authority as President to free any slave. Only with the passage of the 13th amendment did slavery end in America.There are lots of good books offered by Amazon for children than this one. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Two stars for the illustrator,"Besides this being a very bland work, I'm just plain sick and tired of celebrities being able to make money and a reputation by doing children's books. Not only that but they are paid at a much higher rate than those who actually work very hard at this and produce much better work than this. Shame on you Mrs. Cheney and all the other celebrities for taking money out of the mouths of hard working writers, whose lifes are about writing and doing it every waking day on this planet."
1,Cynical exploitation of current rise in patriotic feelings,"This is a cheap book in all respects except price. The quality is poor; the illustrations jumbled and messy; the effect is busy; the concept rushed; children will learn little of value if they are of school age and little ones interested in alphabet books will be put off by the cluttered pages. Cheney is an intelligient woman, she shouldn't have put her name to this mess."
5,BEST OF THE BEST COUNTRY GOSPEL (GREATS),"THIS CD IS WELL COMPILED.INCLUDES BEST OF THE BEST COUNTRY ARTISTS,EXHIBITING THEIR VERSATILITY & GOSPEL PERSONALITY.NOW YOU CAN SEE & APPRECIATE,WHY,THEY ARE SUCH SUPERSTARS.IT WAS PRODUCED & COMPILED BY GREG HOWARD,2001.NO FILLER TRACKS,ALL 14 TRACKS ARE JUST GREAT COUNTRY GOSPEL.JUST BE AWARE!!- YOU WILL WEAR THIS ONE OUT,OR LOSE IT TO A FRIEND OR FAMILY,WHO WILL LOVE IT JUST AS MUCH.GET TWO COPIES-IF AVAILABLE.YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SHARE IT TOO OFTEN (SMILE)THIS SMALL PACKAGE HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE ON MY LIFE,AWE INSPIRING.BEST OF COUNTRY & GOSPEL ALL IN ONE.ENJOY,ENJOY,ENJOY.(P.S) I HAVE NO AFFILIATION TO THIS PRODUCT.I AM JUST A HAPPY RECIPIENT.(VERY SATISFIED AMAZON CUSTOMER) THANKS.JOAN"
3,Just Okay,"This toy is very cheaply made. I didn't mind the assembly, it was pretty easy. However, I disliked the plastic grid all the pieces came on. They do not snap off very easily and tend to leave sharp points. This is obviously not good for little hands. I ended up having to use a box cutter knife to remove the pieces from the grid so they had smoother edges.The boats are cheaply made. The tops are snap on and water easily gets inside them, sinking them quickly. The decorations are simply stickers. Not the best idea for something that is going to get constantly wet from splashing and play. Next time I will invest in a higher quality toy (and one that has one piece boats).On the positive side: the crank does work to help move the water and the boats around, and my kid loves playing with it. It's also great to fill up with all sorts of different material for sensory play (water, gravel, sand, rice, etc)."
3,fun but a little bit hard to set up,"When I got this item, the box was big than I've thought.It took time for kids to set up all pieces(about 1 hour).My boys like this toy and they want to play with it at beach.It doesn't look sturdy. So I won't bring this one when I go to beach.."
5,Great cheap toy for little ones that love water!,"We bought this for our 2 year old's birthday. She loves playing with water. We also bought her a Aquaplay water toy too. Although the Swedish made Aquaplay canel set is better quality over all, it was twice the price (on clearance at TJ Max). We love this water set b/c it is MADE IN THE USA! The quality is still good enough for as young as a toddler. My little one has been playing with it for 2 weeks now and hasn't managed to break it yet. It did come with a lot of little pieces to put together, but it only took about 10 minutes or less to put together. We paid just under $15 for the toy - GREAT PRICE! I don't think I would pay more the $20 for it though.Overall a great toy for the price and a bonus for supporting Made in America products.(side note: although I didn't purchase the Aquaplay set on Amazon, it is a great toy. Especially that you can expand it. We got one of the smaller sets and my little one has fun with both water sets)"
2,"A HUNDRED PIECES, POOR QUALITY","The idea and price of this toy is great. And it is fun. But it comes in a hundred pieces, each having to be cut at a number of points from a plastic frame and snapped together. And the left over tabs are sharp if not cut well. Product is also of poor quality. I would much rather spend twice as much for something that came preassembled (one-piece boats, etc.)and was of higher quality."
1,Dont bother,I paid $9.00 for this at toys r us.You get what you pay for.SO many tiny pieces. It's one of those toys where you have to snap every tiny peice from a big plastic sheet. It leaves some sharp plastic edges on some of the pieces. It would be a better investment to pay 10-20$ more for a different one. I do not reccomend this to anyone looking for a decent water and sand toy for their little one. It's what I get though for being cheap.
3,"IHATEPOSERS, ANTIFLAG, AND CRASS","ya. idk. i liked these guys more when i first heard them. idk what the guy b4 me was saying that the vocals are like the casualties. they aren't at all. more like henry rollins with black flag. their riffs are typical punk. nothing STAND OUT. idk. not that impressive. if u like action, then maybe you'll like clit 45, cuz i thought the same thing about action."
4,Exellent technical display of cristal clear passages.,"It is in my opinion, that Browning is one of the greatest technician of the keyboard. Every note was clear, heard with carefull thought and passion. Many pianists have recorded the complete Chopin Etudes, but Brownings recording is far superior.-Matthew Weissman"
2,Dont bother with the Math section,"There are so many errors in the match section of this book! They do not even know what the proper algebraic usage is for multiplication/division versus addition/subtraction! They give you one question, but when they deduce the answer it is a totally different question, so of course your answers are going to be wrong! I didnt even bother with the Science section, this book is going in the garbage pile!"
4,Excellent prep for exam!,"I really feel that this book helped me prepare form my nursing school entrance exam. It has excellent practice tests and a lot of them, so you can really get a lot of use out of the book. I did extremely well on the exam after working with this book. Highly recommended."
1,Barron's How to Prepare for the NET?!?.....yeah right!,I would give this book no stars if I could. It was simply a waste of money and time. I studied the book thoroughly only to find out that the NET test in TX was nothing like it. When you sign up to take the NET just by the book that's provided by educational resources its structured exactly like the test.
2,Ok book,Didn't find this to be very helpful at all when it came to actually helping me prepare for my nursing school exams.
4,An excellent cooking oil saver!,"This is my second Eastman cooking oil filter pump. Now that I know how to properly use it, I will continue to filter my cooking oils without making any mess. It's a great time saver too! By recycling your $$peanut oil, it pays for itself after only one use!"
1,Worthless,At least other bad products do the job they are designed to do poorly. This one didn't even do the job it was designed to do. It would not pump the oil up to the outlet point. It is going back.
3,Great Customer Service,I had this product for over a year before I ever used it. Then this Thanksgiving I got it out and pumped 3 gallons of the 4 gallons of oil I was putting in storage. The shaft on the pump came loose from the motor. I took it apart and pushed the shaft back in the pump and tried again. Worked for a while then the shaft came back out. I emailed the company (Eastman) and they UPS'd me a new pump that day. Customer service is great. Remains to be seen if the new pump has the same issue.
2,Worked Great....for a few minutes,"I was excited to try this thing...despite some of the reviews...anyway...I had 4 gallons of oil to drain...the first 3 went perfectly...then, NADA!I took the unit apart..everything seemed in perfect working order...put it back together...switch works, motor works, shaft turns, impeller spins...but No Suckage!For once...not sucking is a bad thing!"
2,"Good idea, poor quality","I've had this pump for about three years now. It's a great convenience for transferring your oil back to its storage container. Only problem is, it's of poor quality. On the sixth time using it, it quit. I don't know if there is another one out there, but I wouldn't buy this one again. Perhaps the electric model is more reliable."
1,Defective switch,"The toggle switch to turn the pump on and off is cheap. Just setting it down on teh counter caused the switch to pop off, allowing a small metal contact to fall off. This is the second unit on which this has happened. The first time, I attributed it to possibly rough handling. But the second time taught me the lesson. It is handy, but extremely fragile.Jim"
4,"Great item, part of stubby ratcheting screwdriver set",This is great! Why didn't the BIG tool makers think of this stuff? They're always touting how great they are but not much follow through these days.
4,Good stuff,"I buy American made tools. BUT this Gearwrench stuff is great. They're making tools that the American folks aren't. They're excellent quality. Taiwan stuff I can buy, I still skip the Chinese made even if it's Gearwrench"
3,Not bad,"It has a nice selection of tracks on it but I think there was to much emphasis on the bigger names like Mody, Orbital and others on this CD. In this sense you get more of a mainstream feel to the CD and in a sense that's what Earth Dance was. If your looking for more of a underground or dance feel to a CD this one probably won't be the one for you. All said it's an alright CD, one that I didn't mind recieving for free, but unless you are big fans of big name DJ's this isn't the CD for you."
5,cat teaser,"Our cat loves this teaser. It is his favorite. When he hears me swishing it around in the air , he comes running . He leapes up in the air, turns over onto his back & gives it a work - out with his paws. It is sturdily made & takes all of the ""abuse"" he gives it as it stays together & never comes apart. On a scale of 1 to 10, it is a 10. Arlene Zivitz"
5,"Right on time, great condition","My son needed a biography for a school project, so we ordered a book on Barry Sanders. It was a great price ($1), arrived right on time and was in perfect condition."
3,ok,The greatest back of all time writes a pretty boring book. some things are interesting. I wish the DVD was better...but you could make a 10 disc set with his highlights.
1,"Great Running Back, Bad Book",What a great Back. Rather booring book. Not too interesting at all. Very blah.
4,Barry Sanders Highlight DVD...... FINALLY!!! But.......,"I've been looking for a Barry Sanders highlights DVD for years.... good news - there finally is one, it comes with the book. Bad news? It's only about 20 minutes long, and doesn't show many of his spectacular runs. The book is outstanding, as it's written pretty much by Barry himself, and has great comments from other players in the NFL, giving him the praise he deserves. Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, they have entire 60 minute DVD's (and more) on their lives.... if any player in the history of football should have one, it's Barry Sanders. All in all, if you like football at all, and appreciate magic, this is a must have, from the most talented running back in the history of the game."
4,Rayland is a little older and less conflicted.,"In this story U.S. Marshall Rayland Givens is working in South Florida and takes off to Italy on his own time, to follow a fugitive who has given him the slip twice. He shoots a couple bad guys along the way, finds romance and ends with his famous, ""I give you 24 hours to get out of town"" ultimatum followed by the showdown at a Miami hotel restaurant.The writting is paired down, dialogue and action heavy. An easy, breazy read. If you've read other Elmore Leonard stories or have enjoyed the F/X Justified series with Timothy Olyphant. You're going to want to read this book."
2,Not impressive,"Pronto is not particularly well-written; in fact, it's downright poor. The plot is OK but rather predictable. I won't bother buying anything else written by Elmore Leonard."
2,Nice story ...,"... but not more than that. There's no suspense. The ""hero"" of the story sounds like a highschool drop out - dropped out after the first grade. And 25 odd percent of the 400 pages are a Leonard navel-gazing. That was a waste of my money."
1,Don't bother.,"I started this book 3 times and couldn't get interested in it. The writing and grammar are poor, making it a very difficult read. It starts off in such a way that it feels like you are jumping into the middle of a story about characters you know nothing about and don't have any reason to care about. I couldn't even finish the book for our book club."
3,Not Bad,"I've read four Elmore Leonard novels, and this was my least favorite of those. Pronto suffers from a predictable storyline and sometimes unlikeable characters (I'm referring to the good guys; the ones you're supposed to like). Not bad, but I'd recommend LaBrava, Bandits or Rum Punch over this one."
2,A few good parts make Pronto barely readable,"Pronto started out great, but slowly became a predictable story about a bookie who gets in trouble with the mob. Harry was totally selfish and all of the characters were boring. However, the sequel Riding The Rap is good."
5,Super fast and super cool,"I guess it's broken record time, but Elmore Leonard is the man. I've never read anyone who can absolutely glue me to the page like he does. He begins with interesting scenes, all of course moved by the amazing dialogue. Then he enters even more characters you would expect to just fade away but later on become some of the most important characters of the book. And, the strange thing is, I never FEEL like I'm reading it. I feel like its happening, a little film in my mind, with the recovering alcholic Harry, the cool cowboy Raylan and the Zip. You'll understand what I mean when you read it. They become characters you know and love and enjoy and when the book is over you want to do nothing but read on about their adventures. If this one has a follow up, I'll be first in the line to the bookstore. It glued me to the page as usual, and by the time I was finished I couldn't put it down. Rest assured one of his coolest, easy-to-fly-through novels yet."
2,So ... that's it?,"Legendary writer Elmore Leonard has been pushed into the spotlight lately due to the success of the films ""Get Shorty"" and ""Jackie Brown"", and since everyone has been gushing about Leonard's novels, I decided to check out ""Pronto"". I must be missing something. Maybe ""Pronto"" is one of Leonard's lesser efforts, and it would probably behoove me to try him again, since I thought the novel was slow, unoriginal, and rather dull. Leonard occasionally comes up with some snappy things for his characters to say, but the characters themselves didn't warrant my attention, and the story they were involved seemed pointless. I suppose my major complaint was that I knew where the novel was going, and it took an eternity for Leonard to get there."
4,The master,"Elmore Leonard is the absolute master of the crime novel genre. I just got turned on to TV's Justified (thank you, Netflix) - but Elmore Leonard's backlog of crime novels are good for a re-read every few years."
4,For fans of Elmore Leonard,"Very good book by Elmore Leonard. His writing style is easy to read and understand, plain spoken English. Some of the same characters from the FX series, Justified."
2,Uncharacteristically Weak,"Oddly enough, while I enjoyed the followup to this (Riding the Rap), I really didn't like Pronto. I found the prose totally pedestrian and hack. I couldn't really care about the good guys, and the ""bad"" guys were more interesting, but alas, not funny enough to save the experience. Of the four books of his I've read, this is definitely the weakest."
2,Boring......,"This is a slow read and I have put it down.... The characters are pathetic and losers. The story bounces around and is fragmented. Consider a book like ""Taken"" by Robert Crais, now that's a page burner by comparison."
4,Pronto,"This is Leonard's introduction of U.S. Marshall Raylan Givens, now the central character of the excellent television series ""Justified."" The series features some of the great villains on television. Pronto is the beginning and a must-read for Raylan fans."
3,68TigersFan,"I watched this on cable when it was released and have had fond memories of it since. (Referring to the high heels ripping through the rag top scene)Now, 23 years later, I relate to the movie differently. The car chase with the cement mixer is goofy out of pace and the bus crash aftermath was basically just a smerk. I looked forward to my favorite scene but seemed let down, just not sexy compared to whats out today. I liked the action with Randy and Clete in the second part of the movie and it had a decent enough story behind it to watch till the end."
3,Perplexed!,"I bought this rolling shopper several years ago and loved it because it is small, easly folds up, can carry a moderately heavy load and I love the color. So I bought two of them to replace my worn out one. The first time that I used the rolling bag the wheel fell off, so I tried the second one and the same thing happened. I managed to secure the wheels by wrapping wire around the prong,but what is happening with the quality of products today??!!Buy with caution!"
3,In some circumstances might be ok,"Information on this product might have been more specific i.e. the thread size and pitch. Needed a 1/4 x 20 thread size and this was smaller. Tried to tap the hole to fit a larger size but the bakelite type material crumbled. I am sure they would be fine if my lid had the right size stud. If you are drilling a hole or there is already a hole in your lid, I am sure the knob would be alright."
4,Great replacement knob,"Purchased this to replace the knob of my small 1.5 qt Revere Ware pot. Had to widen the original whole a bit to accommodate the screw but otherwise, it is a great fit. Replaced it about 2 months ago and so fare I actually, like it better than the original knob."
3,dissappointed service was fine just did not work,the screws are 2 short and I'm having a hard time finding the same thread and the right size to fit my glass top.
3,Replacement pot knobs,"Perfect fit for the pot. Should of gotten a little bigger, but was perfect for the pot Very easy to handle."
3,Sizeof screw,I found that the screws sent with the nobs were too short . Ihad togo and find the right size. Charles A. Phillips
4,A good deal,I needed to replace a broken knop on one of my le creuset pots but didn't want to spend $20 (with shipping costs) this works great and I even have an extra should I need one for another pot.
3,"Cheap, but does the job","These are not high quality, but they do the job. Two sets of knobs, screws, and fingerguards come in the package. This is good because one of the knobs may have some *minor* defects (one of mine was a little rough around the edges).I used this to replace a knob on a crock pot lid. It works perfectly, but I could not use the fingerguard due to the screw being too short. It stays on rock solid.Unfortunately, this product does not appear to be available in white (comes in black), so it may not completely match your crock pot set. That being said, it looks fine and works great."
3,Did the job,All crock pots should have universal replacement knobs. This did the trick but did not fit exactly like the old one.
4,Slow Cooker Is Back In Business,"Got these knobs to replace a broken one on my Rival slow cooker. At first I was concerned when I received them because they were round and my slow cooker lid was oval. However, it went on with no problem and fit perfectly. This was a very inexpensive way of saving an otherwise perfectly good slow cooker with a broken knob.I would have given 5-stars but when they were delivered the knob package was opened and it looked like one of the knobs had been used and put back into the package. There were minor scratches and signs of use, but it did not affect the form, fit, or function of the knobs."
1,Worthless. Don't bother.,Title should say it all. Very cheap. Won't fit anything. Screw too short. The least bit of snugness causes the handle to disintegrate. There is no way it could stand up to any kind of heat. What were these guys thinking!!!!
3,Finger guards give protection,"Fit the bill for what I needed, however I had to purchase longer stainless steel screws for the assembly to be correct."
1,junk handles,"these things are horrible. they can't even serve as a decent paperweight because the are thin & light. the screws were too short for the crock pot that i needed to install them on. so i checked the thread and pitch of the screws, matched it, verified it, and replaced them with some longer ones from home depot. well on one of them, it ate up the cheap plastic threads inside the handle, and for the second, it did the same thing even with the original screw. pieces of junk in my opinion. i was gonna put some inserts but decided to just buy some ""hopefully"" better ones on amazon. i really do NOT recommend these. save your time and money and get something else."
2,"""Fitz-all""-I don't think so","Selected these, pretty close to the type that we had before. When we got them, the screws supplied were too short and we had to go purchase our own. Other than that, we will have to see how it holds up."
5,Replacement Pot Knobs,"I needed to replace the knobs on 2 crockpots so was pleased to find this set. The Finger Guards could not used however since the extra width of them plus the glass lid combined was too much for the length of the enclosed screw. This does not bother me however, as I am very pleased to have handles on my crockpot lids once again! I would recommend this set and if needed I would buy them again. Thank you to the seller for a smooth transaction!"
5,good taste great drink,I tried this brand because it had lower cholesterol and higher precursers and more vitamins than my previous protein drink. The smell is better than the taste but it isn't that bad. I would recommend.
3,"Good quality, wish it was longer","The spoon is about 5in diameter and 1.5in deep. Rubber handle is pretty good, 6 in long. Handle to spoon is 8in long. I wish it was longer to work with my wok."
1,Piece of Crap .....Do Not Buy !!!!!!,"I should have known better when I saw the price . It looked to good to be true .......and it was . Product worked fine for about 3 months of normal use . Then it crapped out . I thought maybe some of the wires came losse . But after checking and re-checking all of my wires and connections, there was no doubt the amp died . I took it to have it repaired, but the cost of the repair exceeded the cost of the amp .It's like anything else.....If you want quailty, you are gonna have to pay for it . A good rule of thumb is, a good amp will cost about $1.00 per watt and high quality amp figure $1.50 - $2.00 . So it you are looking for a 300 watt amp, your gonna pay $300.00 - $350.00 . If you go cheap like I did you will just end buying 2 amps . Going cheap in the long run will cost you more in the end ......"
3,A *Twinkle Twinkle* for Slightly Older Children,"They have the age range correct on this one: 4-8.Along with Jane Taylor's original text (first published in 1806) this book features Michael Hague's enchanting drawings.His artwork is colorful and nice with an 'old fashioned' touch. The text is displayed within the pictures which are too complicated (in my opinion) for babies or even toddlers. There are fairies and angels, dragons (cheerful) and firebirds. And while the imagery is not simple, one would probably also not call it lavish. If you are familiar with Paul O. Zelinsky's work, it is not that nice.Three to Four Stars. A nice book that is not for babies, but is certainly more interesting than most versions of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."
5,The Poet Walks Through all of Western Civilization,"Where Baraka, as a nationalist poet, looked for new forms from Africa to escape the prejudiced West, Yusef K appropriates all of Western culture with aplomb, dealing with the slave societies of the Greek and Romans and their Gods as well as walking through the middle ages and talking about current times. His knowledge of ancient history is impressive. The poems work on many levels, like the poem ""Racoons,"" which is about hunting these animals with dogs but also about, horribly, using the same techniques to hunt down runaway slaves in the slave south. No book I know deals so powerfully with the long history of large scale slavery in Western history."
3,"Basie, but tepid. And I didn't think Basie COULD be tepid!!",Basie is always worth putting on the player.But this...it lacks punch & sizzle. Too laid back.Perhaps the band didn't like the material?Basie or Bond fans may still like it--I like it---but I'd hoped for more.The Hipster gives it a reluctant Thumbs down!
2,fun music from 1966....IN MONO???,"Okay, this is still fun big band music, not great jazz. For years I enjoyed my original reel to reel edition from 1966. Bought this CD and it is a fantastic sounding MONO edition. Yeah...no stereo separation like my reel to reel. In fact, I am A/B comparing the two recordings as I write this review. Now that it is out of print, perhaps someone will revisit it in the near future (hello, Mosiac Records?)."
4,Teenage Mini Series-This was my first Amazon Instant Video purchase,This was my first Amazon Instant Video purchase and it was great... just wish I had the option to download it and watch it on my T.V.
4,Infectious Songwriting combined with Masterful Musicianship,"This CD has the type of songwriting and rythms lost on todays manufactured Top 40 ""music"". It's difficult to put a label on the bands style, but lovers of country, blues, and rock will enjoy this album. I find myself listening to it over and over again, not only for the lyrical poetry Russell writes, but for the way in which it is delivered with such captivating expression. Woody Russell seems to have a special gift found only in the most legendary artists. I expect future albums to me more refined, but as far as debut releases go, this album is top shelf material and a must have for the true music lover."
5,A Big Band Masterpiece,"The Thad Jones-Mel Lewis big band was the harmonic and natural successor to the Count Basie band. With some of the best players of their era, its members included Joe Farrell, Jerome Richardson, Dee Dee Bridgewater (who often sang because her husband played sax in the band), Pepper Adams, Snooky Young...need I continue? Yes! How about Sir Roland Hanna, one of the great piano player/composers? I consider this album one of the best and most overlooked jazz albums of all time. As a sax player, all I can say is if you like big band jazz or Count Basie, you will love this album. It is a musicians' and audience favorite.PS-One of the most beautiful jazz ballads ever written and covered by many jazz players is on this album: A Child Is Born."
1,VHS 4 less than 30 minutes,"Do I understand this correctly VHS for less than 30 Munites, I will not even bother spending my time and money on this item."
1,Errors on study cards,"Hello, fellow suffering students preparing for the GRE. I cannot recommend these study cards! I found several errors in the math cards; some simple misprints and some calculation errors. On the verbal cards some words would be listed in the adjective form while the definition was given for the noun, and vice versa. I found them to be very detrimental and began to consult my dictionary for many of them. I also bought ""The GRE for Dummies"" which was much more helpful, since it gives a clear explanation of all of the math problems, while the cards do not."
2,Not helpful,"I am using various study tools, and these cards are usually left on the bookshelf because they are a waste of time. The definitions on the vocab cards are confusing and there are errors on the math cards. It might be a quick review but in no way complete. If you do use these cards, it should only be as a supplemental tool to a study guide (I like Barron's) which will give you a much better idea to what the test is like."
1,Ace- GRE flashcard review,Never received the item. Sent an email to sender and never replied or refunded my order. Very bad experience. GRE exam is this week and no cards to study<
1,not even my love of Bjoerling's voice,"could get me to listen to any of Verdi's stuffy, croggy, rarely- a moment- of-beauty operas. Give me Wagner's 3 great operas anyday. Thats passion and beauty."
4,Syncronize please!,"First of all I think this is a good DVD, but I hate watching and hearing in no perfect syncronitation and this is exactly what happens with the oppening tracks.The band is excellent (And I thank Lenny Price for the names 'cause I was still looking for them in the DVD credits or in an Earl's explanation.By the way, Lenny, your work is fantastic here and on every record you touch).Theese are the reasons that have made me vote only 4 stars, but I have enjoyed this concert a lot.Sergio."
3,Pretty Good,"Im not going to go as far as saying this is a definitive Earl Klugh collection, but it is pretty decent. He has a full band backing him which i could have done without. The song selection is decent. There are 4 or 5 solid songs which makes it worth buying. I absolutely love watching Earl play. Every move he makes seems too easy. His hands just seem to glide upon the strings. If you are a guitar player, this is a must have."
5,One of the best jazz guitarists ever,"It seems that most everyone agrees that this is a special DVD concert by Earl Klugh. I only wish this was done in a more relaxed or should I say less 'recording studio' like setting. Having said that, I really enjoyed the quality of the recording on this DVD. If you love smooth jazz and/or Earl Klugh, get this DVD."
5,want more!,"This is an impressive DVD/audio. I have never seen him perform, just have several of his CDs.The picture-video is satisfactory, the sound is excellent, anyone know of any other recorded concert by Klugh?, now mywife wants to go see him live when he swings nearby...gychang"
5,Excelente... maravilloso,"Sigo la trayectoria de Earl desde los inicios de Dr. Macumba en disco de vinyl, desde esa época quedé prendado de ese sonido maravilloso que salen de sus mágicos dedos. Desde entonces he obtenido toda su discografía, sin embargo no tenía el placer de poder verlo a través de un vídeo. Es sensacional... con que facilidad y soltura toca la guitarra, Magia! Su banda es excelente y el sonido inmejorable. Lenny Price parece de otra galaxia! Altamente recomendable este vídeo. Sus fans esperamos por nuevo material. Bravo Earl!"
5,Finally! A preacher with HOPE for the future!,"In a year full of Christian doomsayers cranking out books about Y2K and the ""last days,"" it's so refreshing to find a Christian author like Winkie Pratney, who expresses hope for this generation of young people. Winkie Pratney's passion for young people is evident throughout this very readable book, as is his sense of hope for the future.As Pratney says in this book, ""This is not your father's revival."" And he's right. We in the ministry can benefit from Pratney's wisdom and prophetic insight to do what we can to guide young people -- while understanding that this is their revival, not ours.Everyone involved in youth ministry -- or in *any* ministry, for that matter -- should read this book."
3,"Novel, but not for beginners","This is a great book offering new insights into the evolution of the Templar mythos; however, it requires a fairly thorough understanding of the history of the time period. Partner frequently names people and events without providing sufficient background. I also wish he had been a bit more thorough in the second part of the book. That said, it's worth reading as he does provide views and evidence that won't be found in another single source."
5,Soul Calibur the yardstick by which...,This is the most entertaining and visually appealing game I have ever played. The graphics are amazing! The characters and scenery are depicted in incredible detail. It's also fast and almost impossible to quit playing.
5,Amazing fighter for the DC,"In comparison to Soul Blade, this game is a towering improvement. To Soul Calibur II, it is a little behind, but then, it was released 5 years prior. This also represents a very smooth transition of storylines from the first to the second in the series.Combat commands in the straight spectrum are highly developed, though 8-way-run attacks are limited to two or three basic attacks. Still, the game is very fun, and fun to play over and over for a long span of time. The voice-over/narrator guy is hillarious also.This game's museum mode has 335 pieces of unlockable artwork and different skins and modes, as well as more than 10 unlockable characters. The first set of museum pieces completely explains the Soul storyline, and the events that lead up to where the game is; something you have to nit-pick through in SCII to figure out just what happened since this installment. For Dreamcast collectors, or fighting game enthusiests, I highly-reccomend this game."
5,The most complete game ever,"This game is so good..so amazing....i dont even know what to say...The graphics are mindblowing better than you'd think the 128-bit system could handle....the extras that you could unlock in this game are astonshing...you can direct instant replays make movies, etc. all in all this game is worth more than the 50- price..you should even buy the dreamcast for 100 and this game because this game makes it worth it."
5,The Greatest Fighting Game-Ever!,"Soul Calibur is unquestionably the greatest fighting game on any system, ever. It is the most graphically impressive Dreamcast title to date, and has set a new standard for all games to follow. This game got a perfect score in every major videogame magazine. It is reason enough to buy a Dreamcast, and if you already own a Dreamcast but don't own Soul Calibur, what are you waiting for? You need this game, it is a must buy."
5,One of the Three best DC games!,"This is in the top three DC games, besides Crazy Taxi and NFL 2K. It has the greatest graphics and an easy gameplay. I have owned this game since October 99' and I still to this day play it on occasions. This is a must have for all DC owners!"
5,AMAZING,"This is, without exception, the BEST FIGHTING GAME EVER MADE. PERIODRead the other reviews, everything positive said about this game is true. I know thats a bold statment but graphics, gameplay, story, modes, music, replayabilty is all EXCELLENT.Don't listen to any Sony fanboys that are mad that Soul Calibur was a Dreamcast exclusive - It truly does live up to the ""hype"" (Its not really hype when its absolutely true, utterly amazing)I hope you have the chance to enjoy the fighting game to end all fighting games."
5,i bought a dreamcast just to play this game,yep.i bought a dreamcast just to play this game.it rocks.that's all i have to say.
2,Pretty graphics,Soul Calibur has some great graphics but it's to bad the game play is so lame. The game is easy to beat on the hardest difficulty just by button mashing. The fighting is nice but not nearly as complex as some other good fighters out there i.e. Virtua Fighter 3tb or Power Stone. The arenas while all having a different shape all play the same in the end. There is really no point in buying this game unless you want a mediocre fighter with very little replay value.
2,Most important aspect of any game is gameplay,"This game has stunning graphics, good load time, and tons of extras. So why do I give it only 2 stars? Because the gameplay is seriously flawed. Like Namco's Tekken, SC can be played by newbies who get lucky with button bashing. This means that serious gamers who invest the time to master moves are simply not rewarded for perfection in timing and skillful execution. Secondly, the balance of defense and offense is off. A person could go wild on offense and the veteran who tries to defend will have a tough time countering and reversing. A truly balanced fighting system would reward skilled players who can predict the opponent's attacks and react accordingly. There is another fighting game with much deeper gameplay (but less flash to it) and that is Sega's Virtua Fighter 3tb."
3,A Huge Dissapointment,"For The Love Of God Don't Believe The Hype! This game had so many people kissing it's butt it wasn't funny. I got it and it was a huge let down. Soul Blade on psone was better then this! Sure it's all pretty, but it's basically just a virtua fighter clone with wepons and smaller backgrounds.alot of the charactors are basicly the same (Astoroth&Rock/Mina&Kilick/Lizardman&Sophitia/Inferno&Edgemaster) The backgrounds while pretty are basically just the old 2-D backdrops used on the first 3-D fighters. The ""innovative"" world tour mode had been done in SFA3 already so that wasn't a huge plus either. Dead or Alive 2 kicked this things butt as did the painfull to play VF3. If you have either of those forget about this."
1,lame game,"the controls are so limited and clumsy that I do not know a player who has not be frustrated to tears. press down of the direction pad and sometimes you go right and sometimes you duck. the difficulty of combat, or speed of the opponent is not consistent within the same level. the game is mildly entertaining, but do not attempt to master it, or any such nonsense because you'll just wind up getting frustrated and bored. attacking gonzo-style almost always wins over tactics, so that beginners can beat experienced players with frequency (until they start trying to use tactics)."
3,too complicated,it is too difficult to repeat complicated moves. this game requires to much precision to make the fighters do what you intend.
1,Overrated pile of junk,"I can't understand why people like ""Soul Calibur"" so much. Yeah, it has nice graphics, but eye-candy can't save a game that is simply NOT FUN TO PLAY! There is no fighting strategy, no combos, no special attacks, no jumping, no nothing. You just have to press the same attack button on the right time again and again and again to win any fight. Of course, it gets very dull in a few minutes.If you think gameplay is more important than graphics, get ""King of Fighters"" (either ""KOF Dream Match"" or ""KOF Evolution"") or ""Fatal Fury - Mark of the Wolves"" instead."
1,Not as east to play or as fun as Ready 2 Rumble.,"Sure at first glance this game looks nice, and if you own it, it can be enjoyable, but what about your friends who have no idea how to operate the ""8-way run system"" or how to ""guard impact."" I end up spending more time explaining to my friends how to play it than I do actually playing it. With Ready 2 Rumble, I tell my friends there are four punch buttons and two block buttons. That's all. Unless your friends are as into Soul Calibur as you are, buy Ready 2 Rumble."
1,Soul Calibur is the WORST!,"This game stinks - it's way too easy to beat,there aren't enough characters,enemies are brainless, stages are way too small,and the only thing good about it is the graphics. This is nothing compared to Ready 2 Rumble. I hate this game!"
5,The Last ONE Standing!!!,"I have been a fan of fighters for some time now, old and new and one seems to stand out. Soul Calibur is the fastest, strongest, and most entertaining of all. It's got everything a fighter should have with no hang ups at all. A large selection of characters (loads of unlockable ones as well), Number of stunning arenas, and multiple modes of game play that will never get boring. I reccomend this title to any gamer no matter what you like. Can't go wrong. The best fighter to date, Weapons down."
5,You Want To Be Beat With An Ugly Stick? Here's Your Chance,"10 characters, the ability to unlock new characters and levels, and more weapons than you can muster. All this in a fighting game? Not just any fighting game, Soul Calibur! Smooth Graphics, awesome attacks, large/small weapons, and a good competition. You slice apart the enemies with swords, shields, rods, and giant axes, and the ultimate weapon, Soul Edge. The last enemy wields the giant Soul Edge. He is made of fire. His name is, obviously, Inferno. Fun game, painful moves, and move-all-around arenas make this game a *smashing* hit. For Dreamcast owners."
5,Incredible Game,"Ok, Plain and simple. If you have a Dreamcast you HAVE to buy this game. If you don't have a Dreamcast, you need to go buy one RIGHT NOW, just to try this game out. No matter how much I praise it, I still wont do it justice. I cannot believe a game of this caliber (no pun intended! ) is possible. The graphics are simply stunning, the animation is fluid, the character design is great, controls are precise, and the whole thing is just a joy to play. Add to this the fact that there are a ton of characters, costumes, stages, and game modes to unlock and you have a game that you just cannot pass on. This coupled with the fact that the game is offered at a ridiculously low price. Do yourself a favor and buy it now. You will be amazed at what you'll experience."
4,Great fighting game. Bit boring after getting all characters,"Soul Caliber is the greatest fighting game I have ever played. I love the way each character is mastered in their own weapon. The extra modes available make it more than a normal fighting game. I personnally don't really like fighting games, but when I played this in the arcade it blew me away. The only reason I didn't give this game 5 stars was because the game gets a bit repetetive after you have gotten all characters and have beaten the mission mode."
5,Best fighting game ever created,"Title says it all. the movements are fluid, graphics are more realistic than any of its predecessors. Highly recommended, if you like Tekken or DOA.....this blows them both out of the water."
5,Best Fighting Game Ever!,"This has to be one the best games on the Dreamcast, if not the best. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay lasts. With the addition of the mission mode this game will last for quite some time. Very challenging. I still haven't completed all the missions and I got the game for Christmas. Buy this game and you won't be disappointed!"
5,Warning! You will be suffering Post Soul Calibur syndrome!,"This game is the best 3D fighter out there, fluid motioncapture animation, no polygonal tearing, beatifull cloth simulationand alot of crazy combos.This is the first fighting game where all the characters are well ballenced and not too disadventaged.BUT! This game will spoil the way you see video games. After this you will be suffering from post-Soul Calibur syndrome. What I mean is because the quality level of this game is so high, that every time you will be playing any other game which isnt as good as this one, you will be deeply affected. that's Post Soul Calibur Syndrome for you END"
5,Soul Calibur will kick your tail.,"This game involves a whole lot of strategy, not common with the button mashing games around these days. You actually have to think about how and when to land an attack, and see if you can continue it into a combo or two. Throws are impressive and, while not realistic in any sense of the word take alot of thinking to do because they alter in regards to your direction to the opponent. There is a high degree of playability when two controllers are attached and some really good matches can occur between some seasoned players. All in all, an awesome game. Graphics, sound and control are all awesome!"
5,Just Short of Perfect,"Soul Calibur is a martial arts two person fighter game with an intricate plot, extremely accurate martial art forms and katas, great 3d animated movements, great 3D models, and a gameplay that is near perfect. While it is a little difficult at first to get started (unless you choose a button pushing character like Hwang or Sung Mena), the complexity of the various combos, special moves, timings, the soul and spirit charge, and additional features make for a game that is enjoyable to play for years. At first, the eight directional move is a little awkward, but once you get it mastered it's second nature. Also, mastering 8 directional move is the key to dodging and countering, which are your best friends in this game!"
5,5 Star for Serious Country Fans,"This collection of Tanya's hits is a great buy for the fan. There's 20 tunes here, running for 1 hr and 8 minutes. The material on this disc is unmistakebly country, with force and attitude. Nobody can acuse Tanya of being fluffy. This is serious music. Tany's rough voice is perfect for the tough songs. My favorite tune on here is Some Kind of Trouble - great beat and great storytelling."
5,Love Tanya,"This may well be the all time best female country ""cheating and heart broken"" CD. (OK, I admit it's more modern country than Kitty Wells and even Patsy Kline. But it is way better than the garbage coming out as country nowadays.)If you like hard core country, this will please you. If you hate real country music, skip it."
4,Works wonderfully,Makes the job of frying in the turkey fryer so much easier!!! Fryer gets used more now that this funnel has been purchased. Great product!!!
2,"Verbose, confusingly organized, skips concepts","I'm having to read this book because it is the required text for my MS program at Johns Hopkins University, MD.I just hope others do not end up in a situation like mine, i.e. a combination of a lousy instructor and this ridiculous book which does not go in an orderly fashion to describe concepts.It tries to cover too much ground and results in disconnected reading. Concepts are not put forth in an orderly and understandable manner.You'll need other companion books to support the contents of this book.Your only hope of getting anything out of this course and book is if you have a good instructor. But then if you have a good instructor, I don't think he/she would choose this book. This book is suitable for instructors who are themselves confused and this book helps to maintain that level of confusion throughout the course."
1,the worst reasoned text I've ever seen,"As a text for Computer Organization, this is simply the worst thing I've ever seen. Explanations are top-down but eventually rest on lower level facts unkown to the student or unmentioned by the authors. (e.g. 'explaing' PC-relative addressing with a 1 sentence explanation of what the PC is). The effect is heightened by the frequent uses of straw-men and half-truths which must later be emended, further confusing the student. Having written assembly and then taught assembly and assemblers for 20 years, I can read paragraphs and even pages before discovering what the authors mean to say. It can take half an hour to discover that something in a summarizing list or table has not yet been explained. I hope I am mis-guided and that this text was never meant for the course (Computer Organization) in which it is so widely used."
4,Good for students,"If this book is a required reading in a college junior level computer architechture design course, then this book excellently serves that purpose. However, as a reference, this book is poor considering the slow pace at which concepts are developed."
1,Save yourself the headache,"Right off the bat this book is unorganized and has huge leaps of logic. The chapter excercises are painfully unclear, and nearly impossible without a knowledgeable instructor. Given the answers it is clear that the writer ""assumes"" you picked something up from the chapter that isnt there. The material is simple, put in a fustratingly complex manner. Get a different book if you can, this one isnt worth the effort."
2,Could be 5 times shorter,"Good book but could have been 200 pages not 1000. Authors very often explain very primitive and easy to understand concepts in great details. Even though the material is good and both authors are incredibly knowledgable in the field, I simply didn't have time to read huge chapters on relatively obvious concepts.The book is good for freshmen level CS majors and beginners, but for junior/senior EE/CE majors I'd suggest to read the more advanced book from these authors"
2,Advice for advanced reader,"I have a math degree but never did much CS in college, and now I am trying to answer a simple question: ""what's inside a computer?"" I found this book to be good, but better suited for an undergrad or a high school student. I found a book I like better, John Hayes, Computer Architecture and Organization (1998)."
5,An Interesting Step-by-Step Aproach,"I use this book as a reference in my technical writing.I recommend this book to everyone who have a basic Assembly Language programming background and want to understand everything behind the Machine Language Operation Codes decoding process.The authors build from scratch (and you learn from scratch):* How to build a complete Arithmetic and Logic (ALU) Unit- Basic Logic Gates processing- more advanced topics as Ripple Carry* How to build a complete Control Unit to guide the ALU Operation- Microprogramming vs. Hardwired Control Implementation* Assembly language examples for programming the Control UnitIs a good Technical Book in this area.Complement the study of this book with a review of the Assembly Language Programming presented in the book ""The Art of Computing Programming"", Volume 1 by Donald Knuth (also, if you need more application examples of low level programming, review Volume 3 ""Sorting and Searching""). This is a very good study track."
3,OK but you have to know where to find the CORRECT informatio,This book is fine if you read it straight through. Worked fine in class but when used as a reference book it fails because the author often doesn't give the exact answer at first. He abstacts it from the reader until it can be better explained later. Makes looking back at this book hard.
3,long-winded and repetitive,"Large sections are repeated over and over again. Every ten pages or so, the entire subset of MIPS instructions are repeated. I would have been grateful for a more condensed version of the book. A large quantity of whitespace exists on each page.With some editing, this book would be great. I'd have been grateful for something smaller, lighter, less wasteful of paper, easier to lug around, not to mention with less reading material. It could have been done in 200 pages."
4,Not bad,"I used this book to learn about computer hardware and architecture. One must realize that the subject matter (that the book discusses) is quite difficult and requires much thought. In spite of the difficulty of the material, the book explains topics quite well. It focuses on specific computer architecture implementations. Thus, it is mainly up to the readers to understand the implementations by reading the book carefully, and ask themselves if there are better ways to implement the computer design.The book is a bit verbose. I wish it were more succinct. Also, the book could have done a better job explaining the esoteric topics in even more detail such as virtual memory. It also could have provided more examples to help the reader understand why the various designs work.Overall, not a bad book, but it is certainly not for beginners that have no previous knowledge of basic digital design (such as MUXes, decoders, encoders, gates, flip-flops, state diagrams, state tables, K-maps, etc.)."
1,Beating around the bush?,"I was required to read this text for a Computer Design Class, and must say it was anything but an easy read. The book could be commended for being very comprehensive and thorough, but don't expect to speed-read through this one. The author for some reason decided that it would be a good idea to teach you the concepts presented in the book backwards, tell you ""oops, just kidding"", then explain how you really do it. This can lead to hours of confusion and frustration, trust me. Also, my instructor (thank god for him), often times told the class to skip over relatively large sections of the book on a normal basis, because true to form, it tends to be entirely thorough with information that is not entirely pertinent. Often times even when very clear about what was presented in the chapter, you'll find yourself confused after reading 15 pages, in which a simple idea was presented. If you can avoid this book, you'd be well advised to do so. I'd like to burn my copy. Oh, only if."
2,"Book's ok, author's not","The book is difficult reading, but if you need to read it for a class and you spend hours on it, it'll work out. Luckily it does not convey the lack of care for individual students that is characteristic of one of the authors (we'll leave Mr. P unnamed). He doesn't care about students at all, in fact, he sees them as hassles in the way of his greater glory. Back to the book, it's pretty good."
2,"Book's ok, author's not","The book is heavy and difficult reading, however, if you must read it for a class, and you spend countless hours trying to understand it, it might work out for you. Luckily the book does not convey the lack of care for the students that is characteristic one of the authors (we'll leave Mr. P unnamed). He doesn't care about his students as individuals, in fact, he only finds them to be hassles standing in the way of his greater glory. But, back to the book, it's pretty good."
1,Complicated and confusing,How in the world can you understand this book.This is too technical and extremely hard to follow.The exercise in the chapter doesn't even relate tothe content in the chapter.
5,Great Lens Hood!,The Canon EW-54II Lens Hood is sitting pretty on my Canon 35-80mm lens.It truly makes a difference. And it's a quality item. It helps with glare. It helps keeping moister and fingers off the lens/glass. And it actually makes the lens look more aggressive.Snap Caps and filters work well with the lens hood on as well.Darren/Texas
4,ARAL-LARA,"Kind of worldy, a tad pretentious in spots, but overall an excellent listen. Great melodic tunes with some beat and some electronica thrown in and quite moving at times. Higher Octave music made an impact on me in the early two-thousands and I have enjoyed many of their recordings to this day. This particular disc may have had its day, but I still recommend it. Good even for exercise or dancing."
5,This is incredible music,"This is the most exciting and innovative music that I ever heard. It is juicy and luscious and inspiring, earthy, grounded and soaring, full of incredible contrast and depth. I would like to find more music like this. The violin is so masterfully played, to perfection. And the rhythms support it in an incredible sound experience. Please please put out more music like this. Let me know if there are other albums similar out there. I got the Aral album from Higher Octave as a sampler years ago and have ever since been wondering where these incredible musicians are hiding. keep up the good work, our planet needs it .... from fellow musician Angelika"
4,Good product for the price,"It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio. Now, you need to decide what you want, getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD. You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on. If you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic. This mic is quite good for its price. I would probably say, it exceeds your expectations.Arrived as promised in a frustration free packing. Also, make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body ( may be due to transportation) but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks."
5,Impressed,"This product was everything i was hoping for, the sound is great, loud and clear with very little hiss. It picks up little to no background noise and sounds very good, even through my guitar amp. the effective range is sort of low so it would be best for singers who tend to use the mic very close their mouth."
4,A rehearsal workhorse,"This is an excellent, general purpose microphone at a reasonable price. I'm a classically trained vocalist, and I use the SM58 for rehearsal and ""scratch"" recordings. It delivers clear, true, and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing. I still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the Studio Projects C1), but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the SM58 for everyday use."
5,For A Great Audio Performance The Shure SM58-LC Microphone,"I selected the Shure SM58-LC microphone due to my personal experience using this mic on stage, where it is considered to be an industry standard. I'm currently using mine with a GLS audio cable with XLR-F to 1/4"" mic cable (three pin to two pin) conversion into a Fender Amp Can (for portable amplification with perfect performance before small audience)."
4,Good all around vocal mic,This mic works better for some people than others. That being said it is the first mic I put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them. If it doesn't sound good then I try something else. Other than the quite pronounced proximity effect this mic suffers from I have no complaints.
5,Sounds great!,"I'm in a little band and I bought this mic to replace a little cheapy $40 one I got from Radio Shack. Big difference. It sounds GREAT! It wasn't that much more money than the cheapy one it replaced and the difference in sound is really noticeable. So far I am very, very happy with it."
2,Don't buy a used one - Counterfits are being shipped,"I wanted a Shure SM58 for my vocals in a band and knowing that they are so durable I thought buying a used one would be fine and save a few bucks. Unfortunately, the used one was obviously a counterfit, more than likely a new counterfit. I'm currently requesting a return through Amazon. Since it was not sold directly by amazon, the return is not as smooth already as I would have liked. I'm hoping to hear back soon from the seller. I would caution anyone considering a used one, to reconsider and definitely watch the videos on the net about the differences between real and fakes. Best of luck."
1,Hissssssssssss,"I know singers rave about the Shure SM 58 but this product really blows. I mean this thing sucks the big one folks. I'm not sure if I got a defective product, but there was an inescapable hiss in every single of my recordings no matter what I did to the setting or the computers volume level. Also, the gain dial of my device looked defective and if I dialed it down just a little bit I would lose an incredible amount of feedback.Maybe this is just not a good product to use on Windows (I have Vista 64-bit), or maybe this device was just defective, but whatever the case I am extremely disappointed."
1,"Always blaring sound, on off switch did not work.","The recording from the shure 58 mic was always blaring when recorded on my computer. Whether I kept the mic close to my lips or away. The on off switch on shure 58 mic did not work.I ended up returning this product. May be it was just my luck. Took the 20 % restocking hit as well.This was my first time when I was trying out home recording equipment. I ordered the microphone first, then i realized i dont have any cables to connect it to the computer, then ordered cables, mixer (behringer 802)(see my review of the behringer 802 also, uca 222, stand etc.I ended up returning all the items, but I ended up taking more than a month to try them out, hence the restocking fee.For those interested in home recordings, this video might be helpful[...]"
5,Don't buy a mic clip -- it comes with one,"I noticed that people who bought this microphone ""also bought"" mic clip, so I order a mic clip (for mic stand) to come with the Shure 58. I didn't need to -- the 58 came with one in the box."
4,Doesn't Work with Rock Band,"Not much to say other than this is a fantastic dynamic mic from the legendary Shure product line. And the USB to XLR converter works like a champ... on a PC. I have not been able to get this mic to work AT ALL though on Guitar Hero, Rock Band (all 3 versions) or any other karaoke games for the Xbox 360 despite being a ""generic USB mic"". So, just a little buyer beware - I mainly bought this for playing Rock Band and it doesn't work to that end, so now it's just yet another mic in my road kit for performances but I use it as a backup instead of my main mic since there are better stage mics out there."
2,Not as good as.......,"I have had the first Hampton Xmas cd for some years (What if Mozart Wrote ""I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas"") and I and my family enjoy it immensely every year. This 2nd cd, which I have been trying to find for a number of years, was a bit of a disapointment. Not as good as the first by far."
3,Self-indulgent Vegetarian,"OK, the recipes are mostly great, and for 1000 of them the price is pretty good value. But the author wastes pages & pages with self-indulgent personal stories, bulking out this already massive tome unnecessarily. The recipes are similarly introduced in a self-indulgent, somewhat egotistical manner, even those fairly standard staples that any vegetarian has been cooking up for years. I do like most of the recipes but don't refer to this cookbook very often due to the need to navigate through so many pages to get past the boring bits and find an interesting recipe. The amount of paper that must have been wasted in the production of this book makes the mind boggle."
2,"nice try, but...","Crescent Dragonwagon is easy to fall in love with, I will give her that. I think her philosophies are wonderful and inspirational. I also love that the book is not simply recipes, but also lots of cute anecdotes and stories. And, while I think this book has a lot of potential, I must say that in 8 months of owning it I have only made 3-4 of the recipes it features. Many of the ingredients it calls for are either extremely difficult to find (and I live in New York City!!) or very expensive (I am a poor student). I mean, where do I find Umeboshi plum vinegar or mung beans, or fenugreek seeds and do I really want to buy them for one recipe?? Additionally, most of the recipes require you to refer to another recipe to use as the base, topping, crust, sauce etc... Making a dish from this book requires an enormous amount of effort and commitment, neither of which I have. For a much simpler- yet just as tasty alternative try the Moosewood Restaurant books."
5,Best Vegetarian Cookbook Ever!,"This is the best vegetarian cookbook I have ever used! The recipes are very scrumptious and the ones I have made got reviews from family and friends. Crescent Dragonwagon's narratives feel like your best friend is talking to you, sharing her knowledge and passion for vegetarian cooking. I found the recipes to be innovative and fun, with the end result being a delicious meal to nourish the body and uplift the soul. Even people who include meat in their diet can use these recipes and improvise accordingly. It's truly a cookbook for everyone who wants to cook and serve healthy, nutritious meals.A must for every vegetarian for sure!"
5,"Finally, a good cookbook!","This book not only taught me how to cook, the basics of vegetarianism, but also how to cook many whole (aka health) foods not covered in traditional cookbooks. I also like the personal notes included. They helped me (ex fast-food junkie) be excited about cooking! While most of the recipies are for the dairy and egg set, most include side notes that allow you to transform them into Super Vegan.The only drawback is the amount of time it takes to read/write down the recipie directions... very wordy, but, what style. This is my number 1 cookbook... The Joy of Cooking for Vegetarians!"
2,Passionate but too complicated,"This is the book for you if you've got half the day to cook and a VERY well-stocked pantry, but not if you're trying to make a weekday meal. The average recipe in this book has over 20 ingredients. However, the reference information, which discusses vegetarian ingredients and how to use them, is very helpful. This giant book is also useful for killing spiders."
5,An Amazing tome-written with love,"I can't say enough about this incredible book. I own close to 400 cookbooks and this must be one of the best. Ms. Dragonwagon says this book took 10 years to write and I believe it. Every page is jammed with information, hints, ideas on how to use leftovers. The recipes are imaginitive, doable and unique.At any price this book of over 1,200 recipes is a bargain! I LOVE this book-the author's personality, her joy in cooking and loving life even through tragedy shines forth from every page. If you love to cook and love cookbooks that you can read this book is a must!Now to start cooking..."
5,Passionate Vegetarian,"This is a fantastic, usable vegetarian cookbook. It is as delightful to read as it is to use. It is filled with wonderful anacdotes. Every recipe has a story to it! It is the first vegetarian cookbook I've had that I can see using on a daily basis easily!"
2,"Bad Sound Quality , Artists/Songs Omitted","I ordered this CD for basically just one song--Barbara Fairchild's version of Buck Owens' ""Under Your Spell Again."" The sound quality is not good, & not all of the songs that were featured in the program are on the CD, so unless you are VERY attached to a particular song/performance from that PBS special, I don't recommend it. :("
4,David and Goliath,"I am a Christian so I enjoy watching Christian movies. When I viewed this movie on a Christian channel I had only caught the last 1/2 and really enjoyed it. I purchased this and was able to see the first half for the first time. I don't think the first 1/2 is as good as the second 1/2, so don't let a little bit of a slow start fool you."
1,Aweful!!,"This was a ""Bible"" series video? Give me a break! There was nothing biblical at all in this farce of a dramatization. The acting was aweful, just aweful! This was a total waste of money. I wish I could give this a minus 1. I regret I ever bought this waste of videography. I just turned it off after 30 minutes, too disgusted to view any further."
4,David: The Bible Collection,This movie is so inspiring. I had wanted it for awhile and finally looked on Amazon and found the best price. I am so glad I bought it. It is one of those movies you enjoy watching over and over again and never tire of it. I'm so glad I purchased it!
4,The Bible Collection,I like the production of these discs. The actors are good and the stories are very close to the Bible books.
4,Well done bible series,"The is a very well done series. Like any stage or film recreation of a bible tory there are a few flaws but nothing I found to be outrageous or over the top. I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone, Christian or not."
3,An average adaptation,This adaptation had many ups and downs in my opinion. Scenes with Samuel and Saul were well done but the whole Bathsheba and David scenarios didn't seem right. Sheryl Lee was miscast and looked in no way from the middle east at all. David from that point turned bland and uninteresting as there was not enough praise of God and his relationship with him. From all the psalms that he wrote you would think he'd have more of a spirit for God but this was not shown as such. Overall its an okay introduction but make sure you read your bible first and know what's accuarte and what's not.
5,A look at David,"A well done movie. It follows the Hebrew text faithfully, but I love when emotion you know you feel is acted out on the screen. It is one thing to read from scripture that Samuel anointed David - but to see Leonard Nemoy place that blessing --- truely awsome!! I enjoy reading scripture and to see it so well acted out in this way, many who dont have the time to read can sit back and watch it and know they aren't missing any parts. Buy it, rent it, borrow it from a friend - definately worth watching!! =)"
2,Disappointed,"I have many of the movies from the Scripture Series but I found this particular one was not made as accurately as the others. Much of David's life was skipped or combined in the time series and I just found this one hard to watch and follow. Though the others are good, this one was not worth watching. I was disappointed."
4,Excellent movie,"I just loved this movie ever since I first saw in 1997. I thought Nathaniel Parker did an excellent job of portraying David - he made David seem very believable. I also liked the fact the film ended with great hope - the promise of the temple whereas in the 1985 movie ""King David"" that David seemed bitter and disillusioned at the end. I know ""David"" is not a perfect movie but it definitely struck an emotional chord in me. I highly recommend it."
5,The bible collection,"Movies are true to bible scripture, A+++ acting, moves your heart emotionally and captures your attention through out the entire length of the movie."
2,Missed too many details,"This movie seem different than the rest of the series. Abraham, Joseph, Jacob and Moses all setup the characters nicely and stick to the Bible when writing. The writers for David seem to come from another team. I was disappointed with the production of this movie. I would not recommend this movie for collection because the story is not well defined, they missed too many details and added too many factors that are not in the Bible."
3,Collection review,I purchased this as a visual aid for my 3rd & 4th grade Sunday school class. I read the Bible story and then show the movie to help them remember the Bible. The problem is that none of the movies hold their attention for very long. The stories unfold slowly and at times are a little on the dry side. Some of the movies are inappropriate for children due to sexual content and nudity. (Joseph) I was hoping for solid Bible movies that accurately followed the Bible and didn't resort to nudity and excessive sex. These movies are for mature audiences.
2,More Warner Brothers than Scripture here!,"Having seen the video ""Joseph"", and being extremely impressed, we bought the entire Bible Collection set thinking that all the videos would be of the same quality of writing and production. Unfortunately, ""David"" is a far cry from ""Joseph"", as it seems that an entirely different production team and writers are used. I watch all these videos with my Bible open to the appropriate text, which is why I would highly recommend ""Joseph"", but ""David""'s writers take way too many liberties with scripture, and in the end, it simply is the Hollywood version of David, and not true to scripture at all. I'm sorry to say that ""David"" is uncharacteristicly a flop and not recommended if your serious about sticking with what the Bible really says."
4,Good movie,I loved this movie the reason i did not give 5 stars is because when David takes notice of bathesheba standing next to the window you can see her buttocks. That should not be in this film but i will delete tha 2-3 seconds off of me video.
3,david,"This would have been a pretty good movie but i could not stomache all the killing. I suggest it maybe for a man but, women no."
1,This DVD is defective,"Something is wrong with the compression of this DVD. The movements are slow and jerky. Was this an amateur job? I'm so utterly disappointed, since I'm a huge Jiri Kylian fan. Someone needs to notify the makers of this DVD immediately to recompress the video in a viewable format!"
2,Disappointment,"I am a CPA and Corporate Controller of a mid-size company and I was really disappointed with this book, I thought it would be a lot more thorough, accurate and detail oriented then it actually was. Instead, the majority of the book's illustrations seem to be over 20 years old, appear to be hand-typed, and I doubt accurate anymore in today's modern world. Some chapters consist of general remarks instead of a thourough and accurate description of the issue, background, and the solution. This book is probably helpful for a CEO or COO that would like to get an understanding of the financial environment of his company or for a new Controller that just started his career."
4,CINEMASCOPE AT ITS BEST !!!!,"This is the way movies used to be photographed in Cinemascope ! Unfortunately all too often todays films seem to forget they are made for the wide screen and seem to be shot for the square tv screen with everything happening in the middle. This film has broad scope and wonderful scenery! Spencer tracey is great as usual and Robert Wagner looks like he does now except for a few wrinkles , some gray hair and a few more pounds! I enjoyed this movie and its grand spectacle greatly!!!"
3,a tad of lear on the open range,"an early cinemascope western and thus great to watch, even on a small screen. spencer tracy stars as the cattle baron father of 3 unloved sons (richard widmark most notable) and 1 loved (robert wagner), a half-breed with his second wife, the brilliant katy jurado (you might recall her as gary coopers mistress in ""high noon""). the movie required a stronger script to jump into the realm of the top westerns, but theres enough to give you an idea of what mightve been."
4,King Lear' s scent overflows this western!,"""Broken lance"" is if I may an atypical western, because underneath his script lies the seminal premises of King Lear. A proud baron cattle (Spencer Tracy stealing the show, once more) married with an Indian wife (Katy Jurado, nominated for the Academy award as Best supporting actress for this role) has to deal with his greedy and bickering sons who will fight until the last consequences in order to surmount the legal barriers of the simple inheritance.Widmark is outstanding too in this admirable western, that together with Warlock made of this talented director (brilliant in the Noir genre) redefined with notable mastery, the well known limits of this genre."
4,"EDWARD DMYTRYK, OPUS 34","***1/2 1954. This film, a remake of Joseph L. Mankiewicz'sHouse of Strangers (Fox Film Noir)was directed by Edward Dmytryk. Academy award earned by Philip Yordan (screenplay) and a nomination by Katy Jurado (Supporting role). Description of the relation between an authoritarian father and his four sons. BROKEN LANCE is a true Fox classic with a little violence and a lot of psychological considerations. Spencer Tracy, Richard Widmark and Katy Jurado clearly outshine the rest of the cast, especially Robert Wagner who's as expressive as a stone. Recommended."
4,Broken Lance,Broken Lance is a very good Western movie with Spencer Tracy. My husband truly loves these really old movies very much.
2,Pinkish Red in Color,"This towel bar consist of a pinkish red color much closer to the color of copper than oil rubbed bronze. In reality closer to the pinkish than red, and the color is noticeably different when near other ""oil rubbed bronze"" accessories such as door knobs and faucets other than Danze products. Danze faucets have a superior feel to them for the most part, but this product has a light weight feel (obviously not brass). They are reasonable in price, and you get what you pay for with these, an inexpensive product that doesn't fit well with other accessories with oil rubbed finish."
4,Happy with purchase,"Sturdy towel bar. Easy to install. Color had a bit more red/orange in it than I was expecting, but not too bad."
4,sinatra collection,A very pleasent and musical CD she is a very concise playergood programing and have very good players with her on pianoNot sure if the lady is younger and/or does she sing too!Milan
5,Perfectly Gorgeous!,Words cannot express how beautiful this CD is. Beegie's playing is elegant and romantic. The addition of orchestra to her trio reminds me of the best of Diana Krall and Shirley Horn. A real treat!
4,A Good Find for Mom's Bday,I got this for my mom and I'm glad I did because she said she has trouble finding music by this artist.
3,-,"Eadie's second book offers little of technical interest today. After 35 years, much of it is obsolete several times over. But viewed as a historical snapshot, it offers a fine view of the shifting sociology of computing--about a decade after ""computer science"" had been born as an academic discipline, but before it had replaced [industrial] apprenticeship as the chief way to learn about hardware, software, and the design of computer-based applications. The table of contents offers an odd salad of those three ingredients tossed together, demonstrating just how immature the field really was in 1971 (though all of us practicing our trade then would have indignantly denied any such charge)."
2,2.5 Stars,"Rasheed is one of the most promising artists out of Dope House records and Low-G is pretty decent himself, but this album is mostly meaningless music with some content to it. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,"This is great no doubt but ,","......if you have ""the first 30 years"" DVD you don't need this one. This is the same complete performance that's on there + there's actually more stuff on ""the first 30 years"". When are they going to release: all the Kirshners stuff, all The ABC In Concert stuff (including Cal.Jam 1), and any other BOA stuff that might be floating around ??? Inquring rockers wanna know! Most youngsters that I've tried to turn on to BOA just don't get them. I tell them,""you had to have been there and seen'em live back then""....I've been a fan for over 1/2 my life !"
1,not my kind of live music,not my kind of live musicBLACK OAK ARKANSAS / LIVE AT ROYAL ALBERT HALL by Black Oak Arkansas
4,good fan with limitations,Overall I like this fan. It moves a lot of air and I like the knob on the front of the unit. The only drawback is that you can't adjust this fan - at all.
4,"Quiet, efficient, but limited by stand","I bought this fan to use at work, which tends to be a bit hotter than I prefer. It replaced a Honeywell fan that was larger (and noisier!) than this one. The Duracraft is much quieter in fact, so that the fan doesn't distract me while working on projects or meeting with people in my office. In most respects I love this fan. It's quiet, well made, and inexpensive. My sole complaint is that the fan doesn't tilt vertically. Since I like to put my fan on the floor, it means I have to prop it up with a book to get it aimed correctly. It would be really nice if the fan had a basic tilting mechanism for that purpose."
1,Not much of an air mover.,"I purchased the Honeywell to replace this fan. This fan only has 2 speeds, the Honeywell has 3. This Duracraft fan just didn't have the output that the Honeywell has. The Duracraft does not have an adjustable pivot either; it is fixed in a stationary position, with an adjustable lever on the bottom, but only a few degrees of tilting is allowed. The Honeywell, on the other hand, can be pointed straight up for use as an air circulator. Go with the Honeywell."
5,Cool nights,We love this small fan. Put our a/c on 75 at night and have this fan on the bedside table. Just love it.
3,the picture is photoshoped,"its a great fan but it dose not look like the profile picture, its more of a very plasticity gray look, with no shine to it"
3,Not so quiet,"I was looking for a small quiet fan. I read the reviews over and thought this a quiet fan. I have in a Home Theater room. While the movie is on I can't hear any sounds from the fan and moves a lot of air(On low speed). But with either the movie not playing or a quiet spot in the movie, I hear the fan more than I want to. Too bad there is not a real low speed."
5,An ideal little fan,"I bought this fan because my office is chronically stuffy with insufficient air circulation in the summer. I put it on the credenza behind my desk and have it blow on my back. The low speed is usually enough and does not blow papers all over. It has fairly quiet operation, so that is a plus. It will not be distracting on the high speed. It's great for coming back into the office on a hot day when you are a bit overheated and need some extra cooling to get you back to normal. Go getchya one!"
5,Got some good power,I bought this fan for my desk at work and I was surprised at the blowing power. This is the first fan I've ever owned that I keep on LOW instead of HIGH. Works great and keeps me cool on days where my work decides its best to save money by turning off the air conditioning. The fascists.
4,This little fan is great!,"I purchased this for my desk, and I've been pleasantly surprised by it. It's just the right size. This is the first fan of this size I've bought, so I can't really compare to another similar one, but I think the airflow is pretty good.The actual fan doesn't really look like it does in the picture though. The finish is more of a flat gray. No biggie, just FYI."
2,Cheap and poorly designed.,"I bought this fan for my desk at work. It moves air just fine, but it's very cheaply made. There must have been a part loose in the fan because the second I turned it on, it started making a rattling noise--nothing too loud, but just loud enough to be irritating. The placement of the control knob (on the front) is also poorly thought out. Because the fan isn't very heavy, I kept knocking the fan off the table when trying to turn it on.Returned for a refund. I'll probably just buy a cheap old fan from Walgreens instead."
3,"Work well, does NOT look like picture!","i ordered this fan because the reviews said it was quiet... which it is. However, I also wanted the silver/chrome and black fan that was pictured. What I received was a gray and brownish gray fan as depited my a user's photo on the site. I though the user's photo was maybe another model because the picture clearly shows it being silver/chrome and black.... hence only 3 stars."
4,Item pictured is not an eye cream,"This item pictured is not an eye cream. A 15ml size Clinique Advanced Stop Signs Eye Cream would be a full size. They do not make a bigger size in eye creams than 15ml. This is for the face , not eyes."
4,"Overall, decent. However, there are some gems on here","Overall, this is a good set. I think it was intended as a showcase of the artists on the Narada label. There are some forgettable tracks, but about about 5-10 great songs on these CDs. All the songs use guitars in different music styles like jazz, folk, experimental, latin, etc. It might even be a bit of a weakness from a commercial perspective that the set covers so many styles of guitar. The one commonality is guitar instrumental, though. Some folks will like some tracks, but not others. My favorite songs are on CD2. Probably the best thing you can do is go the MP3 route, and download the ones that sound good when you sample online. I like the artists Randy Roos and Billy McLaughlin. Other people will like others. After you listen to some of these, you can also buy the individual artists' CDs separately. This is what I did."
5,perfect,Perfect condition. Exactly how it was described. This was a child hood game and couldnt believe i found it n such a good condition. Plays perfectly on my old computer
4,control flare and washout on your lens,"I got this hood for an EF 85mm/f1.8. The filter works as advertised, and feels solid when it's on the camera, even though the mounting mechanism looks kind of cheap.I'm not sure a cheap-o rubber hood would not be as good. Considering the price, you might want to try one out.I give 4 stars because of the egregious price for a piece of plastic.** UPDATE **I want to give it 1 star now for popping off my 85/1.8. Also, as it turns out, this hood sinks, as I found out as I watched it sink into the murky depths of the Berkeley marina.I replaced it with a screw on rubber hood and I've been happy with that."
5,... to serve and protect,"Besides the unreasonable price for all Canon hoods, this one looks great and performs as advertised. It has a black felt interior lining and a firm twist on installation. Besides cutting down on stray lighting, it most importantly protects my lens from getting damage. The lens is heavy enough to make my camera lean forward when sitting down, and the hood provides a convenient resting spot instead of touching the lens."
4,Worthy addition to your Camera Kit,"Lightweight, quick-fitting onto lens,...the only issue is storage and transportation,..need a larger camera case if you intend to leave it attached to the lens."
2,Lousy Hood,"Lousy hood. It is difficult to insert and remove. It does not stay on well. It, does the job when it comes to cutting out glare."
3,Adequate lens hood for a decent price,"This lens hood is not very expensive, though it still gets me to pay $350 for a lens and not get the $20 piece of plastic to put on the end of it. This hood has two buttons on each side that you press in and then clip the hood onto the end of the lens. It doesn't always come off very easily. I don't like this hood as much as the twist on lenses I have for the 70-200 and the 24-105. It seems to serve its purpose, but it's not as easy or convenient to use."
4,Good hood,"I always have a hood on my lens for reasons that photography sites advise.This hood has practical CONS:- It feels a bit flimsy when putting on/off a lens- It is hard to take lens cover off when the hood is on, would be pretty much impossible if you have thick fingers.These CONS probably don't matter since if you need a hood for you Canon lens you will have to get this one. Sigma hoods are the best in my experience.Also it doesn't take much room in your bag if you put it reversed (over the lens barrel), maybe another cm in diameter, not a big deal with my Lowe 170 bag."
3,gets it's job done,First off: I attach a hood to all of my lenses for protection. From all the hoods I've bought for my Canon lenses this one is certainly the worst. I thought the snapping mechanism would be nice feature but the hood sits loose in its notch (and tough rotates freely on the lens). It's not the most expensive Canon hood and since it provides the desired protection against direct sunlight I have to agree that it serves its purpose but it just doesn't feel as sturdy as the snap in type hood of the 50mm 1.4 USM for example.
3,It's a flocked cylinder,"It is a tube, not unlike a toilet paper tube. You could paint a piece of pringles can and make your own. In reality, it should have been included with the lens, (mine was an 85mm 1.8, but this hood also works on a 135mm 2.8 Soft focus)but oh well. i had a gift cetificate, so it cost me 35 cents. that's about what it's worth"
5,Musical Genius,"John Mars sings songs from a corner of the human heart that most of us are afraid of to confront. Cloaked in catchy, often beautiful melodies, and full of humor, wit and gaiety, John sings songs about the most dangerous subjects on planet earth. And always, even in his most hostile diatribes, at the core, the subject is his own human frailty. Do yourself a favor and enter this strange house. It is well worth the price of admission."
5,"It's honest, so shut up........","John Mars music is too honest for you. Go back to your newage or new Madonna record. Maybe MTV can addle your brain some more and make you feel special about yourself. No, you don't need this record. You couldn't deal with it. Shuddap leave me alone while I listen to this."
3,"Not bad, but",the content was not quite what I expected it to be. Most of the content of this book is already common knowledge among professional pilots.
5,the big hanger,"This is one of those hangers that will hold anything....It is sturdy....I hang semi-dry clothers from the dryeron them so they will hang dry to avoid ironing.....These hangers do not leave imprints on the shoulders ofthe shirts, as they are large and thick.....Also, i put semi-dry jeans on them to dry.....These are the best hangers"
5,So awesome,"I'd never heard of Angie Heimann until she came to my college and did a free concert, but she is now one of my favorite musicians. Her music is so simplistically sweet and personal; its like running into an old friend whom you haven't seen in years and talking for hours about random stuff that's happened. She writes songs about everyday things, and some of them are pretty funny (22 Percent). The minimal instrumentation perfectly complements her beauiful voice and add to the down-home, feel-good mood. I listen to this when I'm mellow, or sad, or happy, or anything. It's simply wonderful. Oh, and she has another album out, Substantial Snacks, which is equally good. Get this album!!"
4,Angie rocks!,"What can I say? I was blown away by this CD. I can't help but compare her to one of my favorite artists - Joni Mitchell. The stripped down acoustic sound, the beautiful falsetta voice, and most importantly the clever witty lyrics. I'd give the album 5 stars, but there are a few tracks I find somewhat weak. However, the majority of it puts a big grin on my face. Unlike Joni Mitchell, the majority of Angie's songs have an optimistic, care-free outlook on life. You can't help but feel good when you listen to the ""Suga Woogie Boogie"" or ""Skeletons"". My personal favorites are the haunting ""Nerd Girl"", ""Let Go"", and the beautiful ""Butterfly"". One other problem I have with this album is that it doesn't have the haircut song that I had the opportunity to hear her perform live. I also had the opportunity to sing ""Don't Eat the Liverwurscht"" with her at the IF Coffeehouse in Atlanta. I'll never forget that and I'll never forget Cinnamon Bones."
2,HORRIBLE SOUND RUINS IT ALL!,"This DVD has ABSOLUTELY AWFUL SOUND! Products like this should not be put on the market. As this was my introduction to THE GONDOLIERS (a bad mistake, I found out later, as the majority of the songs had been re-written), so it was quite irritating when I had NO IDEA what was being said, due to an operatic chorus that over vocalises and throws away the consenants, and the fact the the whole thing sounds like it was recorded in a tin can.From getting to know the show later, this visually seems to be a good production, everyone looks their part (particularly the two *extremely* dashing gondolieri), and I have no quibbles with a man doing the Duchess of Plaza-Torro--BUT I STILL HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS ALL THE WAY TRHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE AWFUL, AWFUL SOUND!AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Kentucky Fried Chicken?????,"Okay, so I'm a purist -- within reason. I don't care a fig when directors want to update the production by locating it in 21st century China or precolumbian Mexico instead of Venice. But I care a great deal when W. S. Gilbert's clever and delightful words are thrown away and substituted with ridiculous new lyrics mentioning, of all things, disco and Kentucky Fried Chicken. This might have been a fun antic for a cast party but it makes this production excruciating to watch. Ugh. I haven't finished watching this, and I'm not sure I will."
4,A good realisation that our lives are not that hard,"The photography in this book is as expected, brilliant. However I found a concentration of grim images giving people a perception that the world is really a dangerous sad place."
4,A good book--but not the first version!,"This is not the first children's book based on this true story--although Pelican Press likes to advertise it as such. The book, The Cow In The Silo: Grady's Funny Adventure, by Patricia Goodell, was published as a Little Wonder Book in 1950 and was very popular. It was a favorite of mine and now sells for $50 or so in collectors sites. That version might be a fun purchase for those who remember the original incident. This new version by Ms. Townsend is also good, more detailed and far less expensive! The story stands the test of time and the new illustrations, while not as nostalgic to me, are eye-catching for children. A great way to use it is as my mother did in 1950--ask the children for suggestions, then to think of similar things to solve problems about--often eliciting humorous, fiendish and even surprisingly logical solutions. This is a worthwhile children's book about real life--in a setting that is unknown to many urban youngters."
4,Sketches on Standards/Kenton,A great addition to my Stan Kenton library. Thanks for making this available for purchase.
3,Remembering the barbershop radio.....,"Stan Kenton was a talented musician but this disc makes me think of the days when you went to the barber shop and there was always a radio on the shelf playing big band music. None of that Basie or Ellington stuff, but toned down versions of standards for background music. This disc has the same mellow tone and approach and every time I listen to it I feel like I am back in a barber shop thirty years ago."
4,Straighforward but Unrefined,"Nicol Matt conducts Mass No.1, Helmut Rillin conducts the rest of the works. I find that Mass No. 1, Psalm 150 and the Te Deum are the most successful of the set.The sound quality of Rilling's recordings are wide but somewhat muddy, unrefined, and unclear. The set provides a resonable and inexpensive way to learn and appreciate Bruckner's Choral works.(I find that Jochum's readings of the Masses are a little to clear and refined and emotionally held back...his Te Deum on the other hand is the greatest on disc. My favorite Bruckner Choral set is still the Matthew Best set on Hyperion.)"
1,Absolutely worthless - I returned it!,"I was hoping that this would have original, creative, and practical ideas for things to do with my wife. Instead, almost all of the 365 ideas are unoriginal, insipid, or impractical. An example of each:Unoriginal: ""Go to a bar and play darts with your Love."" (Been there, done that.)Insipid: ""Make a plan with your Love to sneak your own snack food into a movie theater. Execute your plan."" (Gee, makes me feel like I'm in Mission Impossible.)Impractical: ""Take a shower outside with your love. Make sure to have plenty of towels and buckets of warm water."" (In my neighborhood, this would probably be followed by dinner in jail after being arrested for indecent exposure.)I must admit, however, that my wife and I enjoyed a very fun couple of hours laughing at the book's suggestions before I returned it."
5,this book contains good tips on romance,"I read this book and although it offers no brain busting advise, it does offer practical tips that seem to be fun, sexy, and romantic. For me, it served more as a reminder of the fun and romantic things that two people can do on a date. I have been in a relationship for several years and as time goes by, you tend to get into a pattern and dating your mate is not on your priority list. This book helped me and my boyfirend get back into the swing of doing fun things and we've actually started dating each other again. I loved this book!"
3,Agree,"I thought these reviews must be a little harsh. Well, they are. However, this is not to say that this book is good. It is certainly average. You won't find many creative ideas here but they may prove to inspire some.Here are some better books for creative dates. The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb and Creative Dating by Dan Fields."
3,Switchfoot... Where'd ya go?,"Switchfoot has been one of those bands who never write a song just to fill space on an album. Every song has always contained the same tenacity, honesty, and effort... until now. Don't get me wrong, when Swithfoot shines they shimmer but the words sparkle and fade seem to suit their newest effort, ""Learning to Breathe"". While the album does have it's bright spots (brilliant tunes like ""I Dare You to Move"" ""Loser"" and ""Economy of Mercy), for the first time ever I find myself bored listening to Switchfoot. The CD lacks inspiration. With too many songs that serve as space on a CD and not as testaments to their amazing ability. The album is lyrically sound and sonically sober but next time 'round the boys ought to spend a little more time on their music. ...."
3,I Dare You To Move,I Dare You To Move is the best song on this album. I wish the rest of the album could have been THAT good.
2,Hard to breath,"Switchfoot is one of those bands that give christian rock pop music a good name. For the last few years they have lead the way in simple melodies and a raving taste of raw rock. They have always seemed to take their music some place the listener was never expecting and they always seemed capable of creating a great product. Although learning to breath has fell off the chart. This album seems consumed by the over played production of current contemporary christian music. The album does seemed over produced and almost to the point where the producers were afraid of using something called, Distortion. The album never reaches a peak and never creates the sensation of good rock. This album may have had more potential if the simplicity of previous albums were here. Learning to breath in my opinion sounds much like every other contemporary christian artist without any unique twist."
5,Good Clean Fun,"If I could think of just three words to describe Switchfoot, it would be just that. Besides being incredibly AWESOME guys, Jon, Chad, and Tim have yet again proved themselves to be AWESOME musicians. ""Learning to Breathe"" is a unique and catchy album that is hard to resist. The journey from track one, ""I Dare You to Move"" to the final cut, ""Living is Simple"", is full of non-stop action-packed music. The thing that amazes me about every single one of Switchfoot's CDs, is that the style is never the same through each song.. which for musicians, like myself, is inspiring. Speaking of inspiration, the lyrics, written by none other than jon himself, are full of depth, sincerity, and at all times (""Poparazzi"") incredible relativity. This CD is a must!!"
4,A delight to listen to,"I recentally got learning how to breath and i am loving every song of it. it is a different feel from the other albums but still a pleasure to hear. i had the oppertunity to see Switchfoot at rock the universe andgot my picture taken with them and their autographs, so this really made my day to hear their new stuff. This one gets more into the 'i know this is relgious music' lyrics unlike some songs on the other albums but i like it that way. a definate addtion to your switchfoot or CCM collection"
5,SWITCHFOOT IS THE BEST BAND EVER!!!!,"This is such a wonderful cd. The music, the lyrics- everything. If you love switchfoot than you need this cd. it is amazing. it is definately worth the money."
4,Not as great as New Way To Be Human,"This is a very good dc but if you are looking for some awesome music I would buy New Way To Be Human Switchfoot's middle album. The lyrics on this album and good and the music is good but it just isn't as catchy as their last one. Still, this album is so much better than most other music!"
5,My ABSOLUTELY favorite CD,"I have always been a rocker girl...and never really like Christian music because it always seemed too much like songs I would sing at youth group retreats, but when I heard this CD, I fell in love with it. Even if you don't like Christian music, you will love this CD. Every song is wonderful and the band is incredibly talented. They can be mellow, but most of the songs are upbeat rock. Anyone who wants to listen to awesome music that isn't overplayed on the radio, BUY THIS CD. You won't regret it."
4,It's the music that matters,"""I Dare You to Move"" first drew me to this band and so of course I had to check the other little music clips Amazon provides. Learning to Breathe is a little less polished then The Beautiful Letdown, but in a nice way. It actually works better for this album I think.Musically, Switchfoot has a very distinctive and gripping sound. Most of their lyrics avoid direct subject references that can turn some people off to secular music, and so this album stands on it's own because the music is just great."
3,"Less Quirk, Less Filling","The above CCM review states the first cut is about as far from quirky as you can get. And that's a GOOD thing? Man, I really loved the first two Switchfoot Cd's because they were incredibly quirky and fresh. But there were also touching moments that moved my soul. I've had this 3rd release for a few months now and have waited to see if it would grow on me. It hasn't. I don't understand why people think a more straight-forward song means more maturity. That makes no sense to me. I found the lyrics on their previous efforts much more creative. One of the attempts at playfulness (""Poparazzi"") comes off as tired and cliched. This is not a bad album, but it's not nearly as enjoyable as the first two CD's. I would recommend them first."
3,ok for staters,"i got this cd player because it was inexpensive and i thought it would be nice to have a Technics cd player to go with my Technics reciever. Over all this was a good cd player but there a few things that bugged me about it. First, there was no repeat function for a single song so i always had to keep on hitting the back button every 4 or so min. Second, it couldn't read cd-r or cd-rw cds very well - it would skip and crakle about half-way through the cd. And last, it looked cheap with the 0-10 phone style buttons on the front cover. Over all, it was preaty good but for those reasons, i later returned it."
5,Sir Evandiw,"Sony VCL-DH1774 74mm 1.7x Tele Conversion lens for Sony DSC-H7/H9 Digital Still Cameras, is optima!!!"
5,My new Teleconverter 1.7x sony really works,"In my hoby, I need all the zoom I can have, it is birds watching and photograp of birds, you know, birds are really tiny and use to be very far away from the camera, but my teleconverter 1.7x really improbes the zoom of my camera and I can bring them really near to my eyes. The best thing is that it doesn't reduce the quality of the photos you can make. in brief, really improbe the zoom, do not reduce quality, easy to use."
5,Impressive,"I ordered this for a good friend of mine. I have been amazed with the results. I shoot with a Canon 40D DSLR and to get anything close to this reach costs 10x as much. He has shown me hand-held indoor shots from a high school basketball game that blew my mind. Sharp, punchy results right out of the camera. I would highly recommend this for anyone with a compatible camera looking for more reach."
5,Very active baby in the bath and mom stay's dry!!!!!,"I just had to write a little something about this product. I was given this by my sister a few days ago, and what a difference!! I have an extremely active 5 month old so bathtime is usually bathtime for both of us. Well, not anymore. I have been using the Bath Apron and Towel and I stay completely dry - even after getting her out ,(an accident or two) and she stays wrapped up and warm, and my clothes stay dry. This is definately a shower gift I will be getting for every mother-to-be! I never looked forward to bathtime until now!!"
3,Not a 'top of the line' telescope,"Very mediocre quality. I expect a lot better when spending nearly $1000. Fittings poorly machined so they don't mate together well. ""Mahogany"" tripod is a cheap painted wood. Overall appears to be something outsourced to Asian manufacture."
5,Lovely--For both kids and adults,Another great CD from Cathy & Marcy. A lovely mix of accoustic tunes. The sophisticated arrangements means that adults can enjoy the CD as much as kids. Good choice of material--humorous to gentle.
2,"Complete, technical, and sloppy","Although this book is certainly comprehensive, the fact that it was written by several people is readily apparent. It is plagued with technical inaccuracies every few pages, and has many redundant sections. With that said it is also the most thorough book on the subject, and provides a ton of useful information. The CD-ROM a glorified coaster, as all of its utilities are antiquated versions. Its discussion on security is weak, and I recommend Guide to Windows NT Security (Charles Rutstein ISBN 0-07-057833-8) for workstation based security."
5,What a Ride!,"After finally listening to the entire cycle I am quite desirous to see what was so wonderfully portrayed sonically. Not having a baseline for the entire cycle I can only conparatively comment on Vltava. Having listened to many recordings of ""The Moldeau"" over the years, I can state that I have never heard a reading inspire what the program notes describe until this recording! The harp during the moonlight on the water section is enchanting and conveys the spirit of the moonlight in a way I had never heard before. Throughout the entire work I felt as if I was swept along the with the river having no control over what I experience along the way. I saw the two streams join to become a rushing torrent. The peasant wedding left me longing to experience the rest of the festivities. I wanted to linger in the moonlight. I felt the stateliness of Prague. A remarkable interpretation."
4,Unusual,It's certainly an unusual story. I don't think one can read any 'anti-feminist' agenda into it; if anything it would seem to me to represent the imbalance between our supposed love of nature and the destructive exploitation of it at the same time. The story certainly lends itself to teach children what love of nature is and what it isn't.Other than that it just seems to be a somewhat eccentric story. It's entertaining but nothing to get excited about. My son (now 4) much prefers books such asPuer Zingiberi Panis: et Fabulae Alterae (Latin Edition)andMusici Bremae: et Fabulae Alterae (Latin Edition).
1,"Exactly what kind of ""tree"" are we discussing here?","A female martyr figure allows herself to be literallty chopped limb from limb by a brutally self-centered male who relentlessly victimizes her, without so much as a ""thank you"", from boyhood through old age. Am I the only reader who is seriously creeped out by this?I have never understood how anyone could possibly consider this sick allegory ""touching"". In my opinion, anyone who gives this book to a child -- especially as a purported life lession -- needs to have their heads examined."
4,"Tortured, haunting book","One of Dick's more lucid final books. Not as autobiographical as VALIS, yet with the same sort of paranoia, desperation and theology. Essential reading if you enjoy his later style."
3,something missing... for me anyway,"I don't know what it is. Valis is one of my favourite books, and TTA is pretty close, but Divine Invasion left me without the usual exhilaration, wonder etc. I found it a chore to read. This book is as full as metaphyscial speculation as Valis, but, unlike in Valis, PKD creates a totally fictional situation. I liked the SF aspects (they were few) even though I have been led to believe that they correspond fairly accurately to events in PKD's life. When then don't I like this book? Everyone else is eager to sing its praises, and they appear to have good reasons for this. It remains a mystery. I'll have to read it again, but I don't think you could argue that this book matches Valis. Valis Regained it may be, but Valis it is not."
5,Dick at his best,This is by far the best of Philip K. Dick. His amalgamation of religions is incredible and eerie. Definitely worth the time in reading.
4,The Empire Never Died -,"This short novel is among the last the Dick wrote. It represents some of his best writing, religion, psychedelica and Science Fiction all rolled in to one. A must read for anyone interested in P. K. Dick's themes. I bought this as a gift - the best deal is to buy the VALIS set from The Modern Library which includes this work alone with Valis and the amazing The Transmigration of Timothy Archer"
2,Philip K Dick not up to his usual,by the end of this book i didn't care at all for these stupid charecters. between switching around all the time and making them shallow and boring i just wanted it to end
1,Explain the Unknowable in Terms of the Not Worth Knowing,"I've enjoyed many of Philip K. Dick's books - he was a writer of ideas (Yahweh bless his soul!). However, I must part company with him on this one. Unless you have already been ""brained"" by early relentless inductrination in Judaism, Christianity or Islam - the three great monotheistic patriarchal miasmas, you'll feel terribly indegested if you try to swallow this book. I read about half of it and got enough of the Torah nonsense, etc. to decide to skim the rest of it, after which I quickly depostited it in the garbage.Religion and science fiction make for a truly putrid concoction. If for no other reason, I read science fiction to recapture a sense of the unimaginable endless complexity and wonder of the world. The resurrection of stale banal ideas from organized religion truly poison my drink!"
3,"A fairly tedious look at God, belief, and Reality","God needs to invade the Earth from outer space in this bizarre bit of theological fantasy from sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick. Herb Asher is the putative father whose obsession with songstress Linda Fox is interrupted by Divine Intervention. Elias Tate aids in bringing Emmanuel to Earth after his off-world immaculate conception. Earth's government fears Emmanuel is a monster from outer space who will destroy the human race, or at least the current theocracy. As Emmanuel grows, his confidante Zina engages him in seemingly endless discussions about the nature of God, belief, and Reality. Perhaps not as detachedly intellectual as ""Valis"" but certainly not one of Dick's better stories."
3,This book is good to use for divorce,this book is inspiring for people who are going through a divorce
2,Not what I expected,"I had high hopes for this book as it was suggested to me by amazon.com as being similar to another author that I quite enjoy (Jan Karon). Talk about a disappointment! Very slow and tedious read, but I stuck it out in hopes that it would improve. No such luck. The characters were not likeable, nor did I care what happened to them. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
2,Over-rated,"The Weight of Water is a great title, but once you see the book cover it's a downhill ride. I love well-rounded women characters and wonderful themes like some of the best Oprah books offer, or a riveting story of love and dedication like in THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, which was a BEAUTIFUL experience despite the presence of so much fighting. Maybe I missed something and many of you will find THE WEIGHT OF WATER worthwhile, but I doubt it"
1,"If I could've given it zero, I would have.","I picked this book because I had seen the movie and loved it. This was, without a doubt, one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters are mostly just annoying and we're never sure of their motivations for anything. The ending made me want to throttle Ms. Shreve.Stick with the movie."
3,Not one of my favorites..,It is hard to like a book when you don't care much about the characters. Not one of my favorites. Sometimes it is hard to believe some of these books are by the same author.
2,A Depressing Tale,"It was well written as Anita Shreve is an excellent writer, but I did not particularly care about reading about a lot of dysfunctional people and their lives and the tragic loss of the young, innocent daughter. It was in a word depressing."
4,A peek at real life,"This was good,maybe too good. I was emotionally caught up in the characters of the murder & the main characters husband & wife duo. As in real life, people sometimes grow apart without realizing it, when they do it's often too late to do anything about it. I found the book very sad, one tragedy after another, but it was captivating."
1,not,One book I did not like.By alternating between two different eras-you get lost in translation.Not at all one of my faovorite.
4,Great Writting,This book has a different writting approach than most I've read but all the same it is great. I didn't see how the woman was pushed to the edge but I could see her frustration. I great book with a unique writting style.
2,confusing,"There are two story lines - one present, one past. Shreve alternates between the two without any warning, and it is very irritating to the reader. If you can't sit down and read this book in one sitting, don't even bother trying. You'll never find your place. (My book club agrees.) If the stories were related in some way, it would be justified, even intriquing, but one has to really stretch to find a relationship. Both involve a storm, isolation, innocence...it's a stretch. The best parts are the description of the Norwegian immigrant experience. The worst part is the jumbled organization, especially since one can find no justification for it."
3,Interesting but could of been so much more,"I first read the ""Pilot's Wife"" then this one. I have to admit her style of writing is interesting and keeps you involved, but overall she must be a depressed person to be able to write these novels. While I had to pay attention so as not to get confused between past and present I found her writing lacking any emotion except utter sadness. Good thing I was already feeling down in the dumps when I began her book."
3,the title is a metaphor!,"as this weavy story connects, albeit vaguely, the two tales it is telling us at once --anita shreve's hand pops out of the page and wiggles around,""see the building storm & the drawing out of murdurous revelations?""""yes,"" you tell the hand, ""it's so obvious and lame, but i'm compelled to go on.""& you do and it's like other things you've read before, & no one seems to have a soul, not like zombies, but the character's are umph-less.it gets a bit over the top in places, just too much drama at once! & then bye. over. oh & i skimmed some gore. how a hammer goes into a skull, and the ooze it leaves behind: i don't need a lot of detail.this book isn't a recommend, but it isn't a no.no.no.- i admit to an intense page turning at one point. read it at a cabin you're staying at, and the book just happens to be sitting about-- the same way you might happen upon a movie on tv you really have no urge to watch but do anyway.not quite like that."
1,"Worse then Jane Hamilton's books,","I finished this book only because it was going to be discussed in my book group. It has all the elements of a book I would avoid, a disgusting sexual relationship between brother and sister, ax murders, and the death of a child. If that isn't all bad enough, the murderer felt that God helped them comes up with the lies about the murders. The author goes back and forth in time, but when she is in the present time she writes facts about the murder trial in present time. One line she is talking about what is going on, on the boat, then we are back at the trial. This switching happens all the time and is very distracting, she could have at least used a different type when she switched, or spaced a line."
2,"Not one of her best, by far.","This book was... not that great. I have read many others of Anita Shreve's and this one doesn't compare. It was boring, and the only reason I finished it was because I picked it out for school, and had to finish it. I'll give props for the ending though, which was creatively different and wasn't what I expected. Do yourself a favor: get The Pilot's Wife or Eden Close instead. You'll have a much better time."
2,Weight of Water,"After reading Pilot's Wife I did not expect a great piece if literature, but I did expect better than this! Very slow, boring and the ending was just awful!"
2,The Weight of Water,"I was thrilled to read another Anita Shreve book until I read it. I was very disapointed in this book nothing is clear, in fact you have to read between the lines. The characters leave a lot to be desired, the main character is weak as well as her husband. The story that it is based on is so stupid to have it weave through this story makes no sense and talk about reading through the lines!"
1,HORRIBLE,"I try to finish every book I start, I almost broke my own rule with this one. I did finish it, but it was excruciating! This book is sad and depressing with no apparent purpose. The twist at the end of the book (which I now wish I had never reached) was completely pointless. The murder's identity is broadcast from the beginning of the book. I hoped and prayed that Shreve would be able to turn this around and make my time spent worth while, but I was very disappointed. Don't waste your time."
2,AWFUL,Just could not get through this book!!!loved the pilots wife but this just dragged and dragged...sounded good but just couldn't read it
5,My Favorite Book,"This book is so gripping! I love it because it is part non-fiction, in the form of an actual diary, which is set in the 1800's, and part fiction, which is present day suspense. I love all of Shreve's books, but this one held me and made me turn the pages quickly, wanting to know more."
5,Definitely Shreve's best,"Having read all of Shreve's fictional works, I would call this book my favorite. As she has done in her previous novels, she alternately weaves the past and present, a writing style which I love. The difference here is that the two stories are only related by themes and not by the actual characters (usually, it is past and present of the characters involved, like Eden Close and Strange Fits of Passion). It is so effortlessly done--you can just feel the jealousies of the female lead in each story rise to the surface. I am surprised that many readers of Pilot's Wife did not like this book as I have always found this to be Shreve's best."
4,Only the ending was a let down.,"I thought Ms.Shreve's prose was vivid and compelling. The characters were sympathetic, even when you may not have liked them. I especially felt for the character of Maren. I accept the overall tragedy of both storylines but I am not convinced it had to end exactly as it did."
1,The Weight of Water was way too heavy...,"The only thing I liked about this book was the fact that I only paid [item price] for it. It was hard to follow, with the author mixing in historical accounts of the Smuttynose Murders, and at one point I wasn't sure what was fact or fiction. I bought this for a book club that I belong to, and felt compelled to read it so I could follow along in the discussion, but this book is not staying on my shelf when it's all said and done. The characters were underdeveloped and the writing was choppy."
3,Almost convinced,"I was completely wrapped up in this book until the ending. The double story was effectively told, the tension was exquisitely done between characters, and the author was highly skilled at switching voice when writing from the diary entries of the woman who survived the brutal murders at the story's center. Shreve's sentence structure in the journal entries reminded me of Melville in their complexity and balance. At the book's end, however, I felt the handling of the plot involving the present day half of the story was truncated...that the inevitable tensions and insights were dropped in their follow-through by a convenient ending that left me dissatisfied. I felt that there was much potential in what had come before that was then taken off the reader's plate before the meal was brought to a proper end. I would still recommend this book to others, but I was not convinced of the ending itself, nor of the way the author chose to handle it."
2,Didn't Enjoy this One,"I like Anita Shreve's writing as a general matter, but I found THE WEIGHT OF WATER to be disappointing. In particular, all the modern-day characters were unlikable and thinly drawn, which made it difficult to emphasize with any of their problems. The flashbacks to the historical period were awkward, and I found the ending of this book quite jarring and pointless. The pacing of the book is plodding and lacks any true suspense.Overall, I found this to be a depressing, unsatisfying read. For those interested in trying Shreve, I recommend trying THE PILOT'S WIFE instead."
3,Gets interesting half way through...,"I, too, was quite excited to read my fourth Anita Shreve novel but this one was quite a let down in the first half. I gave up on it 3 or 4 times but kept picking it back up. Once I got halfway through the book, I finally started to get into the characters. For me, there was too much going on with too many people early on to be able to follow it closely. Once the plot thickened, I got into the book. So all in all, once the book ended, I felt satisfied. But it was the hardest one of her books to get through and I wouldn't read it again."
2,Other work of author better received,"I really had a hard time with Weight of Water. Very choppy and hard to follow..had to re-read parts of previous chapters to find out where I had left off and where the story was going. However, the story was interesting. I read it for a book club and I really like Anita Shreve's other book, The Pilot's Wife. Try this one and you will see where her technical skill developed."
2,Billie's a cipher,"Too many cold-detached characters; we don't even care about the child. No emotional depth in the characters. Even the author seems cold and detached. Too much energy spent on descriptions that go nowhere. The plot is held down by the weight of water and contrivance. Yawn, yawn. The end, thank heavens. (A book club.) We gave it 2 (not one) star because most of us read it to the end."
2,BEWILDERED,"Words can't adequately convey the disappointment I felt upon finishing this book. It was an irrational and unseemly jumbled mess. I don't see how the final ""loss"" was necessary or pertinent."
4,A good read for a rainy weekend,"I had never even heard of Anita Shreve until a friend of mine handed me this book. Since I am naturally wary of books that I have not chosen myself, it took me months to uncover this one but finally, finding myself at loose ends on a cold and wet weekend, I picked it up and hardly put it down until the last page. The author is very adept at telling two tales and at luring the reader into both worlds without any bumps. The writing is top-notch, evocative and clever. I am a big fan of Ruth Rendell as well as her books written as Barbara Vine and this novel gave me the same reading pleasure."
4,"Quick reading, but disheartening conclusion","Overall I really enjoyed the book. I especially liked the style Shreve used to narrate the two stories. By switching narratators within chapters, I was able to enjoy the the rhythm of clues and discoveries presented by the author, without feeling a need to skip ahead.However, I was really frusterated that the story never explained why Maren's relationship with her brother began to deteriorate, even before Maren left Norway. There was also no resolution as to what happened to Maren after the murders.In all, the novel incorporated an intriguing mix between fact and fiction that held my attention. But the conclusion was rather abrupt and shocking, as the actions committed by Maren were not supported by the character and relationships developed by Shreve."
4,Off to a slow start,"I enjoyed this book but it took awhile to get into the story. I find that Anita Shreve is a great story teller with an ease to her writing. The Weight of Water combines two tales.. One in the past and one in the present. Maron who was the only survivor of a murder on Smuttynose Island and Jean who comes to take pictures of the island for a magazine story. While researching, Jean finds the missing piece to the puzzle that can solve the mystery of the murders. The Weight of Water will take you on a journey through family troubles and the secrets that are kept."
1,The Weightiness of Anita Shreve.........,"The Weight of Water is written in a very detached way.... there is no depth of feeling. It is impassionate, hazy. Shreve worries too much about what she thinks is the beauty of her language, and not enough about character development (there is none) and plot (thin, predictable, uninteresting.) The language should be the strength then, but it's overwrought and pretentious. Written annoyingly in present tense, Shreve lets her protagonist wander around in some kind of detached, poetic stupor. The off-in-space look on Shreve's face on the picture printed on the back of the novel is appropriate. The Smutty Nose murders are a great topic for a novel, and I even approve of the direction Shreve takes this. However, she feels the need to attach a dumb modern co-plot, and ruins the whole thing anyway with her so-so very lovely prose. Avoid this book at all costs."
3,Read at Your Own Risk,"While Shreve's prose is always wonderful, I was disappointed by this novel's predictability. Her theme is well expressed in the horrifying accident that occurs late in the book, but I'd been expecting it since about page 30 and kept reading mostly to prove myself wrong. (I didn't.) To make things worse, I also figured out the ""surprise"" for the historical narrative very early, so that instead of shock it imparted only a sense of sickening familiarity. The narrator was not particularly well-drawn, and with only two exceptions the other characters weren't likable. This novel won't draw you in, but its language is so lovely and its tone full of such billowing despair you may be able to overlook its flaws."
3,Another interesting Shreve read!,"There's nothing wrong with a book that is written without the usual fanfare. What I mean is that I think it was intentional that Shreve left many things up the reader's interpretation. That's the beauty of her writings. She need not spell out everything for the reader. I did prefer The Pilot's Wife, but The Weight of Water is a must read for Shreve fans."
3,Tied to The Last Time They Met,"I read this book AFTER I read The Last Time They Met and so I already knew the story line. It was interesting to read it/see it from the other perspective. I am curious to see if I would have enjoyed the Last Time They Met better if I had read this one first.In either case, I think it's a bit of a cop out to write 2 book susing the same story line."
2,Confusing,"This book would have been much better if she would have concentrated on the original mystery, rather than trying to intertwine two plots. The axe murder was much more interesting than the soapopera theme involving uninteresting, unlikeable characters, most of whom I would have like to have seen go overboard. It seemed like I would just get interested in the mystery when she would throw in a paragragh back on the boat. This was frustrating and very confusing. I believe this writer is greatly over-rated."
4,Also read The Last Time They Met,"I really enjoyed this book. Especially since I read The Last Time They Met immediately prior to reading this one. I wasn't crazy about the ending of The Last Time They Met but after reading this one and seeing how they both tie into each other, it made me rethink my reaction and I highly recommend both books."
1,A Slow and Painful Read,This was a horrible read for me. I found that the author spent so much time on detail that I forgot what she was explaining. I often found myself sleepy after just a couple of pages. I did not have a problem following the different time frames as I have heard many people complain. I was originally attracted to this book because of the true murder content.
3,"Unexpected, but alright","I'm not upset about my order, however, it would have been nice if the company had been a little more honest in it's product listing. The book that was shipped to me had a different cover (it looked like the movie poster for this book) and the pages were a tiny bit yellowed on the outside edges, so it was not BRAND NEW as I expected it to be. Despite all of this, the book shipped in a timely manner and I didn't have any other issues with the order.The only reason I was concerned about this book looking different from the 4 other copies I ordered is because I made this purchase for members of my book club and I would have liked to have been able to give everyone the same book in the same condition."
1,Ho Hum,"This novel SOUNDED so interesting and I really looked forward to reading it. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed. Obviously a lot of people enjoyed the book, so maybe I missed something, but I wound-up skimming the last third of it just to finish the darn thing. I still can't decide which story--the one in the past or the one in the present--was more boring. Perhaps if more people had been axed . . ."
4,The Weight of Psychosis,"Well! I read this book on a whim of Anita Shreve, since I loved Pilots Wife and Fortunes Rocks. However, I can not be as enthusiastic with the book. What kept me reading was Maren, whose narrative was intriguing and in depth. Her affection for her brother and disaffection for her husband was one for the ages. The scenes made me feel the darkness of her Isle of Shoals home. The ending of Maren's story was great, but the other woman (which was so memorable that I forgot her name) was dull and boring. It was obvious that woman, where the story opens with, is straight out depressed and miserable. I would have given this 5 stars plus if it wasn't for the miserable wife of an alcoholic. Her husband happens to be the man that her latest The Last Time They Met is in, whic I refuse to read because he is so repulsive."
1,tedium,"I must say I was initially intriged with the plot of this book and am normally fasinated with plots that mix mystery and self imposed dramas from one's life. However, I could barely stand the writing style of Ms. Shreve. She hopped, literally, paragraph by paragraph from present to past and back again, to a point where I finally had to put the book down. The plot was very interesting and was the only thing that held my interest in the first 100 pages. However, I must confess that I finally gave up and will have to guess how the book ended based upon the other reviews of this book."
1,Traumatizing,I enjoyed the story that took place years ago much more than I did the current day one. Also I was so upset by what I viewed as the unnecessary tragedy of the ending that I could not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Modern Fiction's female misogynist strikes again,"As in A PILOT's WIFE and now in THE WEIGHT OF WATER Anita Shreve continues her latent hatred of the male species by combining the likes of incestual love,the killing of an innocent man and the basic distrust of all that is not female.She treats her male characters as ""in the way"" of women becoming self-actualized (or perhaps it's a longing to be male and she's just so angry that she doesn't enjoy the same ""privilege"" given them in society).I couldn't stand the protagonist. I wished her husband had thrown her overboard and gone to bed with Adeline. The story would have been more interesting. And as for her Smuttynose story,Maren seemed like a spoiled baby at times and deserves to die with a heavy heart. Anyone who could take an ax to someone with no teeth does not deserve any compassion.The ending was a horrible copout.Jean and Adeline should have run off together. Much more interesting."
2,Not quite historical fiction,"Shreve is poetic, but the storyline of Weight of Water is silly and farfetched. I loved the description of the emotions felt by Maren the Norwegian immigrant as she lands on the desolate island of Smuttynose in the 1870's. I hated the back-and-forth between Maren's story and the present day. The attempt at parellelism didn't work, and ruined the story. The contemporary characters were annoying and the ending of the book is ridiculous.Readers should understand the real history of the Smuttynose murders. The Weight of Water would have been better if it simply raised speculation of a different set of circumstances around the murders and let the reader decide. Instead, Shreve implicates a real person who, now in their grave, was most likely an innocent victim of a miserable life."
4,The Weight of Water,I loved it. It is very complex. I feel that the people who are giving it bad reviews are finding the book to be too confusing. The plot is deep. The book goes back and forth between two stories and two different time periods in an exceptional way. Sometimes you need to stop and ponder a bit! It's great!
2,Love Shreve; dislike this book,"I was vastly disappointed with this book, the Weight of Water, indeed weighty, hard to get into, with unsympathetic characters. The oddest plot twist to me was the sort of lesbian touchy-feely passage between Maren and her sister-in-law. Most odd was that Maren did not cover herself up or pull down her nightgown after falling asleep. It was freezing in that house, and when a person is cold, they generally wake up and then cover up. Her sister Karen was so horrible I felt she was a cardboard character. But it was the above scene that made me roll my eyes. How could Shreve, such a fine author, have come up with this? Odd, too, that Maren killed Karen with one blow of a chair!Beautiful writing depicting scenes in Norway and off the coast of Maine. Good research, too, but she just didn't pull it off."
5,The WEight of Water,This book is fascinating. I was enthralled. I loved the history intertwined into the plot.
5,The Weight is worth the wait!,"What an amazing novel. Anita Shreve is a master at her craft. I have read all of her novels and feel this was her best. She has the ability to ""dive"" into character's thoughts and provide a riveting story.I recommend her as an author for anyone who likes to feel a part of a story and read it straight through the night!"
2,Every word conveyed sadness.,"An overwhelmingly disturbing, depressing, dark novel. You might want to take some Prozac before beginning this book....you'll surely need it by the book's lonely ending."
3,Interesting read,"I enjoyed the suspense of the double plot and the rather complex characters. One part bothered me, however: what couple would bring a five year old on a rigorous (and potentially dangerous) boat trip? Although it was important to the plot, it seemed a rather reckless thing for parents to do."
2,Interesting....but.....,"As much as I enjoy reading mysteries, I found THE WEIGHT OF WATER to be a real struggle. I can't fault the technical aspects of the novel since Ms. Shreve is obviously a meticulous researcher and skilled grammarian. Where she lost me was with the stream of consciousness approach. I found it disconcerting and more than a bit distracting. I also failed to develop any affinity for narrator and the other prinicpal characters. I found little about them which appealed to me personally. Half way through the novel, I finally gave up the fight and turned to the end. Needless to say, I didn't like the conclusion. It isn't often that I'm so disappointed. Sorry, Ms. Shreve, better luck next time!"
1,Disappointed after reading The Pilot's Wife and Where or Whe,"Did I miss something in The Weight of Water? I was very disappointed with this book, especially after reading The Pilot's Wife and Where or When. Both the story lines in this book were weak. I wasn't even moved by the ending."
4,Normal Shreve Novel,I have read several Anita Shreve novels. This one is like all the others a real good quick entertaining read. Nothing complicated about it just a good story. I have read better but I like when I need a break from more complicated authors to pick up a Shreve book. I liked Resistance the best our of her novels so far.
4,Impressive use of the past into the present.,"I have never read a book that was merged with the ""real"" past and the present, that was so entertaining. I loved the way the author let you feel her insecurities about herself and her marriage by describing the ""other"" woman on the trip. I was so shocked by the ending too. I thought that I had it all figured out, and then all of a sudden I realized I was wrong! I am a bit biased, I have read most of Anita Shreve's books, and I rank this in her top three so far.The only issue I had was an editing issue. I found certain descriptive passages to be a bit long and drawn out. It was a quick paced book, and these excessively long passages felt like speed bumps on the road to the truth. They detracted from my overall reading experience. But in the end, a very well written book."
5,The Weight of Water,"I found this novel to be superbly written. The prose is so haunting and resonating that it reads like an elegy. I would dare to compare it to Atwood's Alias Grace (my favorite novel). I am surprised that the novel did not receive higher praise. The Weight of Water is similar to The Pilot's Wife in that it grabs you from page one but what differentiates it is its unsettling romanticism, however disturbing as that may be. I would definitely recommend this novel to even the most novice reader."
3,Okay Not the best in the series,I love this series but Wednesday's Child is lacking in the spying and intrigue of the war era.I would recommend this book to anyone.
4,The art of translating poetry,This book describes the problems of translating poetry into English. This book Describes many different forms of poetry and tells of the need to not only translate words but the ideas and beauty of the original poem. Well done.
2,Not what I expected.,Good seller but the bra was not what I expected. It was soft but not flexible. It was padded and did not conform to my body. It had a form of it's own.
5,Comprehensive book,"I think it is a comprehensive and outstanding book. It covers all I want about computer networks.So far, I think it is the best general book on computer networks.The materials contain is quite up-to-date. Ihe content is organized in a good way. From the network foundation knowledge to internetworking, even also talk about networking security, application.You can find more information about packet switching and internetworking in this book. I would appreciate the part of ""congestion control and resource allocation"". It really gives me much information about it.It is easy to read. I think it is suitable for beginner who want a general full picture about computer networking. Although it is not a practical but theoretical book, I am still pleased to read it, at least it does not make me fall asleep."
5,Explains How it All Fits,"Starting with very basic assumptions, this book carefully explains the challenges that naturally arise when you try to connect all the computers in the world together. It explains the solutions, of course, but never without giving a good description of the problems they are solving, which I find essential to understanding. You end up knowing the why of everything and how it all fits. Too many books start out in the middle, leaving me wondering why. The writing is about as clear as possible. A great book if you want to understand networking. If instead, you just want to configure a system or implement some code, this is not the book."
2,Cookie Cutter typical amateur woman sleuth very average mystery,"I had high hopes for this series because I'd read that Jacobs was part of a threesome of women writers that included Lee Harris who writes excellent books. Alas, this and the other two in the series are just average, for the money, books about a not very interesting amateur woman sleuth with the same old detective boyfriend, the troublesome child, the not very interesting friends, etc., with the same old dangerous situation for her at the end and the not so surprising murderer exposed. In other words ""you read one, you've read them all"". Definitely not a ""page turner""."
1,Are you serious?!?,"Wow thank you christian nazi conservatives for wasting my money. Love the fact that i finally find ""neo the one"" by slyder and you have to blast sum prick preaching. Christianity has once again ruined something in my life. WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
1,I Wouldn't Give it Even 1 Star if Possible,"It was just bloody awful. Mostly it just has sex, perverted sex and more gawd-awful sex. Barely anything else of a story.You can basically consider it a soft-porn atrocity."
4,Thoroughly engaging characters and a terrific story.,"I bought this book because the description sounded promising,and I liked the idea of setting the story among the searchfor antiques. The story and characters grabbed my interestimmediately, and I could hardly put the book down. I amdefinitely going to look for more books in this searies."
4,Death is a Cabaret,"The book is OK, but much smaller than I expected. I am hoping that it is not too hard to read because of its size. Overall a good buy though."
2,Meh,I listened to the audio version of this book. The characters were flat and the prose struck me as amateurish. Maybe this writer develops in later books but I would pass on this one.
1,You must be kidding!,"I love mysteries, but this one required too much suspension of disbelief. For example, agoraphobia is often treated successfully, but we are suppossed to swallow the idea that a woman with a trust fund opts to stay indoors instead of getting treatment. Please! I was hoping she would be the corpse in the first book to get rid of her! No more of this series for me."
2,Get the Suspension Version,"I was deciding on this sport seat or the suspension version of it. I bought the non-suspension version and is was great for a few miles but then felt just as hard as the non-padded stock seat. Two weeks later, I had the suspension version on my bike, huge difference! Save yourself the time & money and just get the suspension version the first time...."
1,Selfish Point of View,"It didnt take me long to put it into perspective that this book is about the author and not the victims. It didnt take me long to put the book down either, in fact I couldn't even finish it."
4,Great book,This is a great book to share with your child. I bought it after the sensei at my son's Aikido dojo recommended it. He is going over all the lures with the kids in class. He teaches them how to stay safe and to get away from an attacker. Great book!
5,Truly heaven sent!,"Initially, what attracted me to the Wordsearch software was how easy it was to use. But what I love about this preaching library is that it isn't just a bunch of books thrown together. It's obvious that the folks at Wordsearch really took their time and asked preachers what they wanted in their electronic library. This Preaching Library has most of the books that were on my book shelves, and a whole lot more! I thought my sermon prep time would go down dramatically but what has happened is that I spend about the same amount of time creating my sermons because I have all these new amazing resources to tap into! It's unexpected but a huge blessing since my preaching has new depth and authority.I strongly recommend this library to any pastor. It doesn't matter whether you're bivocational or come from a top seminary, your sermon prep will be revolutionized by this Wordsearch software!"
5,Absolutely one of the best examples of good heavy blues,"This is a very powerful type of blues, with heavy bass lines and of course, John Lee's throaty voice. Very laid back, not so much down in the dumps, but kind of grinning to yourself about your own situation... what I like to call ""ballsy blues."" Van Morrison and Elvin Bishop both appear on this one- and Mr. Van makes a great duet voice with Mr. Hooker... definitely my personal favorite blues album..."
3,Western movie,I ordered this movie because of my love for Guy Mitchell. Don't see a lot of him in here but worth it for what you do see!
4,"Lea Salonga album ""LIVE""","Unfortunately, this item was lost in the mail when sent, which, of course, was a disappointment since the seller only had one copy. However, the seller did not hesitate to promptly refund my charge, and I would clearly do business with them again in the future."
2,"""Complete"" guide is not an accurate title","I purchased this book as a reference for my office where we assist drivers with their vision related concerns. I believe the title is misleading. This is a good general guide to adult eye care. It is not ""a complete guide to eye disorders"". Missing are any mention of RP, amblyopia or any of the other genetic disorders we see in our customers. There is no consideration of any of the pediatric conditions which lead to adult vision problems. The book has a thorough description of exam,contact lense and eyeglass procedures which many readers may find helpful. We were very disappointed and will need to purchase another book."
3,Very Technical,"This is a very encyclopedia-type of book. It has a lot of information about different eye problems and is a great book describing the functions of the different parts of the eye and what goes on at visits to the eye doctor. But it doesn't give alot of information on saving your sight, taking care of your eyes, remedies for problems or anything like that. The book claims to be ""The Owner's Manual for your Eyes"" but I don't think this to be very accurate. Its from 1998, but doesn't even include alot about laser surgery."
4,Good Info,"Easy reading, full of medical terms that are explained well for the lay person. Good for gaining a well rounded education. It needs a new edition to update the surgical technology advancements."
3,Reasonably happy,"I remember reading in the profile of this that there would be 4 DVDs and a few full games. The CDs only have snippets of Jordan's ultumate moments. Disappointed, I was hoping to see some great games he played esp. with Pippen and Rodman in full. Also, the story telling looked a bit artificial, and unnecessary."
3,Ultimate Jordan,"This product was good quality and a nice price but the info that was given was not accurate. this product stated that there was some full basketball games,this was dissapointing for someone who enjoys the game itself this was a long highlight film that showed basically the same thing."
5,Must Have for MJ Fans,"Any Jordan fan or fan of greats sports would love this DVD. I saw a little bit of it before I bought it and I had to have it. When I bought it I spent 23 bucks, so this is indeed a great deal. DON'T PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS!!!!!"
5,MUST HAVE For ANY Michael Jordan Fan!,"I'm a huge Michael Jordan fan and would've bought all the movies contained in this DVD collection seperately anyway so the concept of fitting all the the old VHS tapes onto 2 discs is great value.The quality of the movies is excellent, the sound as well. The extra features are fantastic offering short video highlights of Jordan's top ten assists, dunks and passes, as well as dunk comp highlights and nice pieces of footage of Jordan's 10 most significant matches in the NBA. The ""It's Gotta Be The Shoes"" feature is somewhat of a let down as I was expecting the individual commerceials themselves rather than a backstage look at them. Otherwise, this DVD is perfect!This is a must have for any Jordan fan!!!!"
5,awesomeness,Great two disc edition -- including MJ's 5 best games... documentary is great too. Definitely a must have.
5,The Best of Jordan All Time Just Great!,"At first when i saw this DVD online i was not sure if i wanted to buy this DVD but at the end i purchase the DVD.When I Began to watch the DVD i was like ""this is a hot""DVD.I was just overwelmed with the greatest and the arrangement made of this DVD I would say to anyone who really wants a Best of Best Jordan DVD this is it! I imply you would not regret buying this DVD.I cannot say no more to put it short it is HOTTTER THAN HOTT."
4,MJ review,I received the 2 disc set for christmas. I am having trouble with disc 1 on my panasonic dvd player. I initially thought there was no data and returned it but the same problem came up. I have seen disc two though and it was great. I just need to figure our if the other disc can play on other dvd players.
5,"No Doubt, The BEST Michael Jordan DVD Ever!!","Honestly, this DVD delivers on every single level of Michael Jordan entertainment! From his movies, to his Air Jordan shoe commercials to his best dunks, plays and clutch shots of his NBA carrer. Being a total Michael Jordan fan myself, I recommend this DVD to any true Michael Jordan OR NBA fan out there! It's total non-stop MJ action with heaps of other NBA Action in there aswell. In closing, this is the best DVD I've ever had and ever will. If your an Ultimate MJ Fan, ""Ultimate Jordan"" is for you! PS. MJ Rules!!"
4,Available free from the author,"California state government has experienced several major computer debacles over the last several years. It is plausible that part of the explanation lies in the state's personnel system. For this reason, the California Research Bureau was asked to examine the state's information technology (IT) staffing structure. CRB interviewed the top executives of six California companies in order to present a general model of corporate IT employment practices. Case studies describe corporate IT ""job families"" by function, and examine IT compensation, recruitment, retention and training practices. In the second section, the report describes state IT employment practices in these same areas. The result is a useful comparison of private and public sector practices..."
3,Hits the Highlights but...,"...it misses a lot too. There is of course the ABC ""Special Report"" segments but nothing about Prince Charles's journey to Paris to bring his ex-wife's body home. They've included the highlights of the funeral service but left out all of the music, which I remember as being very moving and they end without showing the hearse being showered with flowers. It just seemed they could have included more clips for the price of the DVD."
4,"Fun game, just don't expect too much","I bought this game for $20 from the website when I had the week off from work. I wanted a violent, first-person shooter that wasn't too involved or complicated, because I had about a week to play it. I got what I bargained for. My main complaint is that the maps are painfully non-interactive (you can't drive the cars, for example; the most you can do is break bottles on the street and leave bullet holes on objects). Well, I kinda take that back...I enjoyed blowing up the gas station. The weapons are not too unique...the shotgun does about as much damage as the rifle and pistol, in my opinion. However, I did enjoy the rifle, which had a scope on it. But in spite of these shortcomings, it is a fun game. I played it at a leisurely pace for about two weeks and looked forward to every minute. You can be as violent or as peaceful as you want. In the end, it's a fun game, but don't expect a well-developed masterpiece (like Resident Evil 4)."
3,"Too ugly, too short, great fun though.","Cons:- the graphics is ugly, even if you compare it to some old GTA- the delays between locations are very annoying- the single-player plot is just too shortPros:- terribly funny, in a sick way though, so some people would dislike it- higly ""interactive"", in somehow sick way, too - eg. a dog might fetch a HEAD you've just kickedSummary - great fun and bargain at 10$, so read other reviews and decide if it's fun or sick for you."
3,"A game version of ""A Clockwork Orange""","Sure, this game and others like it are worth a couple of laughs for a short while but it gets pretty boring after a while; plus the game is a little too short.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing Postal 2 but its just like Grand Theft Auto - it becomes pretty pointless after a while."
2,"Not fun,not funny,not worth a single cent....it's that bad.","First off i have to say that i got this game simply because i heard it was ""Offensive"",that being said i thought i would at least get a couple of laughs out of it but i did not.The jokes are for 14 year olds,the game itself is very short and the whole thing feels very cheaply made.The only reason i gave this game 2 stars is because it has multiplayer,thats it,and even that gets old quickly.The game is about a man that works at a video game company and has to simply get through the week doing little chores like getting his paycheck and going to the store to get milk for his lady.These little things turn out to make the week a living hell as danger pops up at every turn...even at church.The game gets old very quickly and even the voice actors sound like they dont want to be there.The ""Shock value"" is not that shocking and thats all this game has going for it.Avoid this one."
3,Overkill,"i think that this game is very fun, but it is overkill. some of the things in this game are just plain sick, play the demmo and see what i mean. only in this game can you walk around with your wener out."
4,Blood and Gore Galore,"Intellectually, I'd say this game wasn't all that great.So, why did I find myself playing for hours on end?I have to admit, for mindless entertainment, it was pretty good.Once straightforward play started to get dull, I was able to throw in my own little challenges, like sneaking up on folks with the stunner, then whacking 'em with the shovel.I also learned that it's much safer to use the gas from a higher level (like, upstairs in the bank, just pour it down on top of the folks in line). I haven't tried multiplay yet, but I'll see if there are still folks playing it online.On a sidenote, there's no such thing as a .22 gauge shotgun. A .22 is a tiny little bullet. This game uses more like a 12 gauge (smaller number is bigger in shotguns)."
5,Magnificent Labeler,"The labeler that this fits is easy to use, has a nice selection of style of label, and the print is terrific. There is a good amount of tape in each dispenser, I think it's a must have for anyone that has quite a few things to label. The labels stick and stay well."
5,Perfect for my older PT-65,"I own an older PT-65 and I could not find any confirmation that this was compatible, but it is a perfect fit and works great."
4,"Brother M231 1/2"" tape for P-Touch Labeler","The Brother M231 1/2 inch black on white tape for P-Touch Labeler is great for labeling my beads to put in containers. The catridge just slips right in the machine, can only go in one way. It labels about 60-100 containers, depending on amount to be labelled on each, before i need to buy more. comes in different colors too. Amazon had a great deal so i bought it at a cheaper price! i just wish it cost a little less."
4,Label Tape,It works just fine. Don't know how many labels I will get for my money though. Without free shipping I wouldn't have purchased it as the cost would have doubled.
4,Brother M231 1/2 in. Labeler Tape,This replacement labeling tape is for a low end Brother labeler. Amazon had best price and shipped quickly.
5,Prints clean and adhesive sticks well while still being removable,"This was extremely easy to install and works great. Prints nice clean letters in large or small font. The labels are nice and sticky, however they are removable. If placed on a non porous surface you can peel it off without too much difficulty. It takes a minute to get the corner to pull up as it sticks very well, but it does come of cleanly without any sticky residue. All in all a great product."
5,A Gift For A Friend...,"Folks,I borrowed a friends label maker to label the wires on the back of my boat's instrument panel before I removed it to install new gauges. I have just ordered my own label maker from Amazon. I do not like to borrow things.""A Borrower or a Lender, never be"". Unless you positively can't help it (emergency).I bought this brother M231 tape cartridge to replace my friends tape that I used. I don't have any idea of weather it worked or not. But, he hasn't complained to me about its quality. Why would he? it was free!I gave it five stars anyhow.Rascal"
5,excellent,The product is excellent to use for office or home use it really comes in handy for labeling all kinds of different products such as househoud items. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,A handy labeler,"I needed a label maker for a job at work, and this one was on sale. I used it, I like it, and I would recommend it. The only drawback is the price of the tape. It is a bit steep, but not prohibitive. I used all of the cartridge that came with the unit, and a part of a new, full cartridge, and I had no problems at all."
4,"Labelling tape ""fits bill""","User-friendly instructions guide in making clear, legible, labels with matching Brother label-maker. Occasionally hard to peel off paper from adhesive backing. Tape easy to install. On-line price better than store."
5,Love this!!,"This is great tape for general labeling. I label flower pots with plant colors, kids supplies for school, my office files. Its a great all purpose label tape."
5,Even if you don't have an actual choice...,"..this is good labeling tape.I've been using theBrother PT-70 labelerfor a while, and use the black-on-white labels as visual aids on electrical/data cabling connection points and to categorize the contents inside plastic storage containers.You don't really have a choice about the tape you use in any label maker; but this loads easily and stands up to the demands that come from occasional applications in demanding environments.Select with confidence for your PT-70/PT-90 labeler."
4,Labeler Tape,The product arrived in a very short time. The price was very cheap. I am extremely satisfied. I would recommend this company to anyone
3,cheap and lasts a long time but hard to peel,I always have my kids peel the back off the tape cause I run out of patience. Otherwise it's fine.
2,These tape cassettes get eaten by the labeller.,"I have had so many of these cassettes get eaten by the labelmaker that I will not use this machine or these cassettes anymore. Once the machine starts to eat the tape, there is no repair; the whole cassette is ruined. I have had new tapes get ruined practically right away. I am through with Brother labelling products. This is the second Brother labelmaker that I have had that has done this. These cassettes are so expensive, and then so many get ruined."
3,wrong one,"it would have been fine, but kind of pricey and i ordered the white one and they sent silver tape, but i didnt have time to return and get a new one bc i needed it right away"
3,Haven't used it yet,"Got it in a good amount of time. The transaction was good. When I use it, I might have more to say."
4,label tape,works well - cheaper than the store - hard at first to peel label - then found that peeling/flicking from the cut end works best for me
3,how to get the backing off,"RE: all the comments on not being able to get the backing off this tape- on the P70 at least, there is a little slot on the back of the printer that separates the label from the backing. Its not obvious- i had to download the manual to find it. Using it takes a little practice- you have to stick the label end in and then sort of strip it against the lip of the slot quickly to get the edge to come off. Then you peel it off with fingers.Otherwise- tape fine but unnecessary space before and after text when printing- shameless way to make people use up more tape!"
1,Too Steep!,"It doesn't say so on this item, but this roll only has 26 feet. That might sound like a lot, but that's 11.5 cents for 3 inch label. That's a rip-off; that whole roll of tape couldn't have more than $2 in manufacturing costs."
1,Never received my purchase,I never received my purchase. I e-mailed twice and never received a response. Cancelled the charge on my credit card.
1,Wrong item and postage due...,"Hi, the item I ordered is still sitting on my desk because I can't use it. :( It is about 5 times to big to use in my personal label maker, not sure if I ordered the wrong one because it looked like the right one and it matched the numbers. But on top of it being the wrong one, I also had to pay the outstanding balance on the postage because the sender didn't have the correct postage on it, which means it wasn't mailed from a post office who would've weighed it correctly, so that was a bummer. Now it sits there on my desk because I don't feel like fiddling with it and having to pay to ship it back, figure out the correct item to order etc. etc. Sorry, I hate giving negative reviews, but it's was just frustrating all around."
2,So Bad It's Almost Good,"Who cares about the boring lesbo stuff...the skinny, rat-faced Heche is nothing to look at, the other one is, but so what? The reason to watch this flick, of course, is Walken...who parades around in Hawaiian shirts, silk dressing gowns with black socks, Coke bottle glasses, a fright mask wig, and Cuban cigar - sometimes all at once. The plot is presposterous, the best scene - and truly a great laugh - is in the hotel room: gun-wielding, condomed Walken in aforementioned get-up, bending undercover cop chauffeur over sofa, screaming prostitute Heche, walked in on by Chen who looks at Walken and says ""whore"" His line: ""It's not what it looks like.....I can't believe I'm paying for this"""
1,Beware!,"Those of you hoping to track down the director's version of this film, don't get your hopes up with the ""unrated"" listing among the technical specifications. This is still the 95 minute R-rated rush-release, it just doesn't list it on the packaging. The director's cut (apparently available only in Region 2) runs 111 minutes."
2,Wild Side,The only edition available on DVD is apparently the R-rated one which does not contain the hot scene with Heche and Chen.
3,Lesbian Passion-Self Discovery,"Overall, the story line and acting are not really that good. Hence the 3 star rating. BUT! , I give the lesbian romance 5 stars. Compared to other passionate love scenes in lesbian movies, such as in GIA, I haven't seen passion between two women portrayed as well as Anne Heche and Joan Chen did in The Wild Side. Their union was tastefully filmed and closely resembled lesbian sex. I am anxiously awaiting the 2000 release (The Wild Side-Director's Cut) which is reported to have a different love scene. All too often, lesbian love and sex is misrepresented by actresses who truly do not understand lesbian romance. It is a rare find when you can capture lesbian romance in its raw form. Other movies which do this effectively, regardless of the plot and acting, include, Bound, When Night is Falling, and Claire of the Moon, to name a few. If you rent or buy this film, I suggest you do it for the lesbian theme. I believe you'll find it quite stirring!"
4,How true love is different with pure sex,"Althouth the plot is not very reasonable,this movie worths some credit. All actors and actresses act well.The personalities are remarkable. And I see how true love is different with pure sex. The prostitute ""Alex"" involves in many sex scences, but only the lesbian scene with Virginia moves me. It is so sweet! When the prostitute in this movie falls in love, she becomes so tender, so caring. How respectfully she touches her lover! I hope viewers catch that point."
2,"An absolutely awful movie, BUT WAIT...","...if you're desperate for a romantic lesbian love scene, the one in this film can't be beaten. The actors--Joan Chen and Anne Heche (pre-Ellen)--are stunning. That gets the film two stars instead of one. In fact, that scene has to be the only reason this film wasn't ground up and fed to the guppies. What a shame that one wonderful scene can't be transplanted into a film with a better plot.DON'T BUY THIS FILM; RENT IT. Once you slip it into your VCR, unless you particularly like heterosexual kitchen counter-top get-togethers or you're dying to see Chris Walken suffer through a bad hair day, fast forward about 38 minutes into the film, where you can watch Anne Heche and Joan Chen do lunch in a cool restaurant, drive around in a convertible, and indulge in an impromptu--and surprisingly beautiful--adult dessert in a seaside cabin. Then rewind, return the film, and spend the rest of your evening watching something else."
2,"Decent noir-thriller, with a few Big Names","Wild Side was an odd mix of thriller, noirish mystery, crime drama, and sex-movie. We get to see Christopher Walken once again parade around as a megalomaniacal nutcase, somewhat out of place in this movie, and with a bad hairdo to boot. The then-budding young actress Anne Heche plays the lead role of a Bank Clerk by day, Prostitute by night. The plot gets slightly confusing and contradictory, but the acting is pretty decent, and the plot, despite its faults, is somewhat clever. Not too bad for a movie who's sole claim to fame is Anne Heche's steamy lesbian sex scene with famous bisexual actress Joan Chen."
2,Very sexy but not a great story,Very sexy interplay with Joan Chen and Anne Heche. The movie is about their sexual relationship. Some of the love scenes are very explicit.
4,IT'LL KEEP YOUR INTEREST,"Short and sweet: A great scene between Anne H. and Joan C. Overall, acting is good, not great, but good. Christopher W's. character is strange but adds flavor to the movie. The relationship that develops between Heche and Chen is intriguing... enough to keep your interest the first time you watch it and even the second!"
3,Antonin Artaud meets Zalman King,"Simultaneously one of the best and worst movies ever. Theacting's Oscar caliber, the photography's beautifully composed, andyet...the movie's completely insane! WILD SIDE's tone ranges from tender, sweet, and genuinely erotic to nasty, creepy, and almost palpably evil. Those expecting just another ""erotic thriller"" are in for a big surprise. The ultimate Christopher Walken movie. One hopes that the distributor, Nu Image, will someday release the 2 1/2 hour director's cut. And yes, the scene with Steven Bauer and the Calvins has to be seen to be believed."
3,"""Cleaned up"" version.","I had seen this movie on VHS several years ago. The scenes between Heche and Chen were especially erotic and would probably be of great interest to lesbian couples. The DVD issue has, however, been ""cleaned up"" for a milder rating. Upon viewing the DVD, I was disappointed to discover that the best erotic scene between the two women, although not that explicit to begin with, had been removed."
4,A good movie with some Brazilian flavor on its soundtrack.,"There's a little bit of everything in this film: suspense,sex or the intention of it,excellent performaces of Christopher Walken and a nice soundtrack of experimentalist musician Jon Hassell,who seems to have been influenced by Brazilian rhythms since the last time he visited my country.If it's entertainment you are looking for,see this movie."
4,Good movie with some Brazilian flavor on its soundtrack.,"This movie has a little bit of everything - suspense,sex or the intention of it,and a lot of good performances of Walken and soundtrack of Jon Hassell,who seems to have got influenced by Brazilian rhythms since the last time he visited my country.If it's entertainment you are looking for,so watch this."
2,"OK, Sega! Where's the real gun!","I bought this gun so that I could rapidly advance up the ladder with House Of The Dead. Although it does have one cute feature, auto fire-auto reload. I still had a number of problems. First, I can't calibrate this gun to save my life. Second, it is cheaply made. There's no way to use the memory card AND the jump pak at the same time. Third, I can't pull the trigger too many times in rapid succession. The gun will go dead on me. Then the screen just blinks. There I was ready to play Rambo or the Terminator and the gun won't fire. Forget about mowing down the zombies in House Of Dead 2. When you get to one of the dead spots, even the zombies will start making faces at you. Only if you're desperate would I recommend this gun."
2,Terrible gun - buy Mad Katz,"The Interact gun does not shoot where you point it - a bit of a bummer to say the least. We returned those and bought the guns by Mad Katz - they were more accurate, and they felt better in the hand."
1,mad catz lightblaster,"I have read alot of the reviews, and while there are a few who liked it, the bottom line is this gun works on some t.v.s and not, on the majority of others, read some of the reviews that the gaming magazines gave it, it was a unanamous vote that the gun had alot of trouble calibrating on the majority of tv sets and even monitors."
1,Don't even think of buying this light gun,"I've had nothing but frustration with this light gun -- even after trying to calibrate it multiple times, it does not work consistently.Also, be forewarned that if you want to send it back for warranty repair, you're not only out of the postage to send it to InterAct, but they also charge $8.00 postage to send it back to you. Rather than deal with InterAct's lousy warranty situation, taking the risk that the gun would be just as bad after ""repair,"" I bought a Mad Catz gun.The Mad Catz gun is MUCH better. Besides the fact that it actually works reliably (a big plus) its auto-reload function doesn't have to be manually configured for the number of shots. The Mad Catz gun is more comfortable too."
4,Great gun when calibrated correctly,"Not sure why many of these reviews ar so negative, but this gun works great for me. I had to make sure it was calibrated correctly, but after that it's as accurate as any other good light gun. Must have for Confidential Mission or HOD2."
5,Great gun!,"You gotta have this gun if your going to play Confidential Mission or House of the Dead 2. These games are a blast to play with this gun. I found the gun to be accurate (I don't think you'll find one with sniper accuracy though). The deep double barrel allows you to hold it like a small machine gun with both hands for a solid feel. Putting the memory card in eliminates the ""light"" feel to the gun, it even becomes sort of heavy after awhile. Can't speak for anybody else, but it has performed well for us."
3,Not very precise,This gun is just not precise. I still can't calibrate it on House of the Dead 2 unless I am a foot from the screen. The sight is useless. There is really no way to accurately aim the gun. There is just about no way to avoid killing a hostage if an attacking zombie is near. Somebody better come up with a better gun.
3,Starfire Lightblaster-Could be Better,"While reasonably entertaining in combination with House of the Dead II, the Interact Starfire Lightblaster proved to be the least durable product that I have ever purchased. I found the grip as comfortable as wrapping my hand around a block of wood. By far the ergonomics of this peripheral are among the worst that I've ever experienced. Interact, please get your ""...Act"" together."
3,"Low Quality Gun, not worth $$","At fisrt the interact gun is fun, but the quality of the trigger just isn't up to snuff. I found my trigger start to break down, and the action got sticky. In my opinion you should go with the madcatz gun, which is licsensed by sega. I have not had any other problems with interact's gun besides this, however."
4,Laying down zombies! Who could want more?,"Have played through HOTD2 (almost to completion) multiple times now. Have not seen the calibration problems or accuracy issues mentioned here by other reviewers - using on a rear projection TV at a distance of <> 6' and been able to make most of the tough shots (zombie behind hostage, etc.). No brightness or contrast adjustment necessary to the TV - phew! First gun worked out of the box, second was DOA (quality issues!). Wife is now happily 'double gunning', John Woo-style. I agree that the grip isn't the best, nor is the quality an A+, but the price is right and fun factor is high. Best of luck - we're just hoping for more gun games!"
2,Buy only if you're in desparate need of a DC light gun,"PROS: This gun has some nice features like automatic fire and auto-reload settings. There is also a second trigger directly forward of the main trigger for reloading. When you fire the front gun sight has a cool looking LED that lights up.CONS: The gun has a very cheap feel to it, it does not feel very sturdy. The overall comfort of the trigger and handle is bad. I had a difficult time calibrating the gun with the gun sights. It turns out that the front & rear gun sights are not aligned with the ""barrel"", this makes the guns' sights useless. Finally the gun could not support my Mad Catz vibration pak correctly. The game would pause inadvertantly and sometimes my pak would get stuck on continuous vibrate."
1,InterAct Starfire Light Blaster - A FAILURE,This product has less than 1 hour's time on it and failed. We cannot find a replacement gun. It seems that Sega rushed to market games which we are unable to purchase accessories for.
4,purely outstanding to all senses especially taste.,When I picked up the gun I didn't expect much but then I put in House of the Dead numero dos and started blasting away howling with glee. Even if you don't own the dreamcast I would still buy it.
3,A cross between portishead and massive attack,"If you are in the mood for slowing down and feeling like doing something illegal, than this is the album for you. The kind of music you would hear in a weird kinda movie like the Lost Highway. Moody female vocals with emotional lyrics and dark beats (like portishead), and dubby basslines like (Massive Attack). There are a few tracks with cheesy male vocals which kinda kills the nice even flow of the cd, but it still accomplishes its objective of creating an erotic, slow down hibernation mode. If you like Portishead, Massive Attack, and haunting female vocals, you cant go wrong here. Recommended..."
3,Thought it would be better.....but still good,"I thought this syrup would be better. I get Starbuck's iced and hot mochas and still nothing can compete. This mocha syrup is good, but not any better than Hersheys. Hershey has a dark chocolate syrup that I highly recommend. Can't go wrong with buying this syrup, but don't expect to be blown away by it."
4,Good enough,"I liked the DD iced latte with mocha favor. I saw them making it just by adding chocolate syrup to iced latte. Although it is not the ""real"" cafe mocha, it was good enough for me. So I tried to do it myself at work. I tried both Hershey and Torani. Torani has a stronger chocolate favor. It still was not like the one by DD so I think I am still missing something. Perhaps it is the coffee itself that has to match. But the one made by Torani Mocha Sauce was good enough."
4,it's okay,I found my self liking this syrup but I was highly expecting the dunkin donuts' mocha latte flavor..oh well..no complaint though..I will but it again.
3,Boy do i feel differently than most reviewers...,"I paid a premium for this syrup, and don't feel it's appreciably better than even Hershey's syrup for mocha drinks at home. Don't get me wrong, most of what I consume would be considered ""gourmet"", but I was simply disappointed by this product. I don't get a richness of flavor depth (similar to Hershey), I don't get a natural cocoa flavor...I simply get a raw sweetness from this ""sauce"".To summarize: it's fine, very drinkable, and does the intended purpose. I personally don't feel it's a gourmet product at all, however. I see from reviews I am nearly alone in that sentiment!"
2,Torani does not correctly send product: SUBSTITUTES WITHOUT NOTIFICATION!,The product items listed in the multipack were not the items sent. Torani freely substitutes the product flavors regardless of customers preference. With alergies this could be both costly and deadly!Very disappointed in both Amazon and Torani for allowing this to occur. Do not buy mutli-packs; it will cost you!
3,Good... but slightly overrated!,"With the purchase of a new single-serve coffee brewer, I was looking to enhance the java experience by finding a proper chocolate addition. My research led to me to sauces rather than syrups and I opted to try a product by Torani, an already trusted name in coffee products. Sadly, I haven't found Torani's Original Mocha Sauce to be all that bold or flavorful. In fact, though I'll continue to use the bottles I've purchased, I won't be buying this same product again."
4,G-Force 6 point harness,This is my 2nd G-Force racing harness. This time I went with a 6-point. The re-web option was the thing that convinced me on this unit. Every 2 years simply send it back and they replace the webbing for a little over $100. Can't beat it. I put this in my SCCA car already and it is very comfortable and was easy to install. Great Product!
4,tip for saving tape,"I've had no trouble with this machine so far. Many people have noted the amount of tape that is wasted, but there are ways to minimize that if you are making more than one label at a time. You can set the margins to narrow or none and then turn off the automatic cutting feature. Just make a label, print, then make another, print, etc. You do need to be careful if you take a break because if the machine automatically shuts down it will reset the automatic cutting feature even though it will retain your last label information. Just be sure to check the auto cut option before you print and rest it to manual and you should be fine. Once you have a long string of labels, you can cut them apart with no difficulty; there are even dots to help you get the cut straight."
4,not yet,"Haven't loaded this tape into my new labelmaker, so don't have a way to review it. But I suspect that it'll work just fine."
4,Kawabata Makoto - 'Inui 2' (VHF) 4 1/2 stars,"Quite similar to his 'Inui 1' (see my review). Turns out that the Acid Mothers key member has many more solo CD titles than I knew about. You get three lengthy tracks [and one short gem] here that are ideal for meditation, expanding your mind and experiencing acid trips. ""Mou"" (9:56), the cosmic ""Meii"" (11:02), ""Shi"" (3:47) and the epic ""Kan"" (l4:18) each serve their purpose well. Not a lot of musicians can pull it of the way that Makoto does - as he creates a truly 'transportive drone-based' piece like 'Inui 2' entirely on Asian instruments. Should do a lot for fans of Maj-Mahal Travellers, some Third Ear Band followers and maybe Amon Duul. Definitely, an acquired taste."
2,Don't be fooled,"i love asian films, so i rented this with very high hopes after the reviews i'd read, i was so dissapointed. its just not that good of a film, i can't understand the high star ratings some give it. as far as being compared to F&F, well, imo this flick doesn't come close. its just so bad, he looses his girl and never really seems upset by it. oh yea, breaking limbs if you loose a race? kinda silly. and the stupidist thing is a guy goes to attack the star of the flick with a needle that is infected with AIDs. thats just bad tasted. the only reason i gave this film 2 stars was because of the EVO and WRX. although the race scenes don't delievry the same sense of speed as F&F, it wasn't bad to watch. i recomend renting before buying."
5,Powerful,"This is a powerful book... deeply disturbing, and necessarily so. Highly recommended... with a note to ritual abuse survivors: It is very graphic, and can be quite triggering. Also, very validating.There were times when the graphic content nearly made me sick... wasn't sure I'd make it through. But when I got to the chapters detailing her recovery and therapy, I realized it's all worth it. Excellent, necessary, powerful book."
1,Harmful used to Authenticate Iatrogenic DID DX,"I was given this book, among many others, by my doctor who insisted I was MPD and needed to fully embrace my diagnosis and increasingly horrific memories, if I wanted to heal. (He also suggested that if I didn't, quite possibly, an evil alter would ""come forward"" to kill my young children.)Books that are sensational and salacious - claiming to be true stories, yet not substantiated, should not be read for validating the DID diagnosis or veracity of the cult activity contained in this book. Reading these fabricated stories should be for entertainment purposes only. Otherwise, it's part of the problem pertaining to the circulation of misinformation regarding repressed / recovered memory therapy.P.S. The posts left among some of my book reviews by Anonymous are erroneous and spiteful. I own the book and read the book. The paperback ""Suffer the Child"" continues to be in my possession, (ironically) personally inscribed by aforementioned ""doctor."""
2,eh,"good, but not a page turner...was hard for me to be motivated to read it, so it took me a long time to get through it... 'Michelle Remembers' is better."
5,"Brutally Honest, A Must Have For All Victims","I first read Suffer the Child after I graduated from high school. I don't even recall who gave it too me but at the time I didn't reconize myself as the victim of Child Sexual Abuse that I am. I remember reading parts of the book to by then future husband and saying I know how that feels I have been there. That got the ball rolling for me. I told my husband of the things I had suffered, and have told anyone who would listen every since. this book is not just about the effects of cult abuse on one girl but the effects of Sexual abuse as well.. Read this book and prepare to cry and see the damage done not jut to Jenny but to yourself as well."
5,Discipleship,"I have been going through the ""Growing Strong"" book with two Christian ladies, fairly new in their faith. It has been a great tool, teaching the importance of daily Bible reading & prayer. It is also a great jump-off to discussion of other topics. I love it!"
5,very satisfied,I am always satisfied with this sender. The book is always as advertised and comes in a timely fashion.
5,Excellent Tool for Discipleship,"This is a classic tool (and series) used to disciple effectively men & women at all ages and stages in their relationship with God. We're using it mainly with adults but it can also be used with Jr. High and High School students. This one-year program can transform men and women into more mature believers who can reach out to others (both Christian and non-Christian). You will have a solid walk with God and ""tools"" to disciple others for the Kingdom. You will be equipped to lead investigative Bible studies in your neighborhood as you live a lifestyle-evangelism focus or teach through this program.I have used it for 10 years with consistent results as the Holy Spirit empowers the process of growth.Best done in a small group of 5-9 plus the facilitator."
4,Certainly one of the best french comedy for 1996,"A very clever comedy, depicting relationship between people of the same family, meeting to celebrate a birthday. This one is certainly not the typical american family, but everybody should find some characters that looks like people of their own. And that's the title : 'un air de famille'. Are all the people the same ? Certainly not much action, but more psychological analysis of what people feel when they must live together."
3,Unhappy People and Cigarettes,"My wife sometimes objects to my procurement of French films of a certain vintage because there is ""too much inane conversation, smoking, and sitting around."" I'm sorry to report that she is often correct in her analysis, and this film would be the latest example.While I often disagree with THE NEW YORKER's Anthony Lane, his review of ""Un Air de Famille"" (listed above) hits the mark exactly. It is immediately apparent that this film is based on a play (written by the actors playing Henri and Betty.) It's entirely set in a seedy cafe that I instantly wanted the characters to leave.No such luck.As the family gathering coalesces, the actors do a good job of fleshing out their characters. But they just aren't interesting enough to fascinate, and they're not funny enough to be anything but unhappy bores. (I am giving this three stars on the strength of their heroic attempts to inhabit their roles.)Maybe I should concentrate on more Italian films..."
1,"It really looked good, but...","The subtitles did not work properly, with only about 20% of the dialog being shown in English. Perhaps I got a bad DVD."
1,Not good at all - Get the Conze (1959) edition,"DO NOT buy this text! The scriptures are not organized in anywhere near the intuitive fashion as the Conze version, and it is missing a whole host of sutras, most notably, EVERYTHING about the conversations between King Milinda, and the Bodhisattva, Nagasena, which are absolutely critical in any study of Buddhism. Lopez's rambling and unhelpful inter-locutions throughout the text are distracting and unhelpful, and really break up the blow of what little original text he didn't butcher. Seriously, buy the 1959 edition by Conze and you will be much happier."
1,Order took too long to arrive.,The book took soooooooo long to get here that I had to reorder another from another person who shipped it in 1/4 or the time it took this one to get here.
5,Absolutely Love my Rocky movies!!!!!,"I just love all the Rocky movies. They have always been very inspiring and motivating to me. Rocky's attitude, determination, and perseverance are over the top. What a true champion!"
3,Probably should have taken the best buy price tag off,"Ordered the rocky DVD collection for $75, received it with The Best Buy price tag of $40 still on it. More fool me, but for all you interested you'd be better off just getting in the car and heading to best buy to pick this up."
5,Rocky 1 and 2 are timeless masterpieces: after that it gets blurred,"Rocky 1 and 2 are pure masterpieces from beginning to end. The music and overall work is near perfection of the movie experience. These two movies never get old and indeed I have watched them several times before. Starting with Rocky 3, there becomes a problem, as if they should have never been made, and indeed a pure terror to watch. Near impossible to sit through these messes. Rocky 3-5 are way hokey and don't work at all. In other words maybe Stallone and gang weren't ""hungry enough"" for Rocky 3-5 and just looking for a payday. Still the set is worth having as Rocky 1 and 2 are strong and up there with other top of the line movies ever mad; which indeed are few and far between. The essence of Rocky 1 and 2 are of the cosmic battle of man to overcome barriers, and self to make a good life in their world."
4,WARNING (Rocky 4) --subtitles?????,"I want everyone who reads this to know that I do very much like these movies. BUT, I have come across something in the fourth Rocky movie that has me upset.Durring the final fight the Russian characters speak in there native language. In the original movies (VHS), the subtitles let you know what is being said. For this dvd release, the subtitles have been forgoten. It wouldn't be so bad, but it is a GREAT part in the movie!I have been trying for quite some time now to get ahold of MGM about this and have not gotten anywhere yet. I urge everyone who reads this to contact them and see if we can get something done about this. Thanks.email MGM at consumerhelp@mgm.com or go to the site at http://www.mgm.com/help.do"
4,We should have had this in the first place...,"I own the older, 5 disc set and it was somewhat disappointing. Rocky I was the only film with any bonus material, and the transfers on Rocky II and IV were really bad by today's standards.This set looks like it will do a better job with new transfers and improved sound, and apparently the 6th disc will be all bonus material. Yeah, it sucks that most of us have to buy ANOTHER DVD set we already own, but at least they'll take the time to do it right this time...at least until the next format comes along.4 out of 5. Only reason for a non-perfect score is the lackluster Rocky V."
3,Finally !! Rocky on DVD !! But could have been better.,"Stallone is my favorite actor of all time, and the character Rocky he portray's is my favorite as well. When I heard about it coming to DVD I was very excited. I preordered it and finally got it. I looks great, it's packaged very well. But I found several things I didn't like. Rocky II and Rocky V are only Dolby 2.0 Surround. No deleted scenes in any of the films. There was lots of extras on the first Rocky. But the only thing I really enjoyed was the 30 min. Stallone interview. The picture quality on all the films was really the best thing about the box set. Rocky II,III; and IV I thought the sound felt dated, there wasn't must bass though my 5.1 system, II and III was more like 5.0. The first Rocky sounded the best, Rocky V sounded good but so did my VHS tape with my pro logic system. Maybe I'm a little harsh but for the 25th anniversary collection I thought it could have been must must better. Thanks for reading."
5,Spectaqular Sound and Picture quality,"well, the last Rocky Box set was great for it's time but, there was only one dual layer DVD in that box. ""Rocky I"" was special edition Dual layer with some special features and the rest was single layer DVDs loaded with only Theatrical trailer. the quality in last package was good but the new package! oh my god! you have too see the quality. yes, it has no special features, even theatrical trailers, but it's worth to replace it with that old set. picture and sound quality is spectacular! 5 high difinition, dual layer DVDs!the only problem is, it was better this set has been loaded with a Sixth DVD full of special features. at least I Beleave the discs still had some little space to put theatrical trailers and music videos but that doesn't really matter. I Suggest it to every Rocky lover and movie collector!"
3,"Absolutely no extra DVD features on Rocky II, III, IV, V","DVD fans might want to think twice before buying this 5-disc set. MGM pulled out all the stops on the original ""Rocky"" DVD, and it deserves credit for that, but there is nothing extra on the remaining 4 discs. Well, they have the trailers on them, but the ""Rocky"" DVD already has the trailers for all 5 movies! You're better off just buying ""Rocky,"" since it's sold seperately, and you'll have all the special features. Keep your VHS copies of the other movies and save your money. I was very disappointed that there was no commentary on the other films, no publicity stills, no interesting featurettes, no music videos ... well, you get the picture. It's a lazy presentation of the series. MGM did a great job with the James Bond boxed sets; too bad they lowered their standards so much for the Rocky set. I was hoping for something much better."
5,The ROCKY legend will live on !,"I always love Rocky because it`s the greatest flim of all time and if you get it get the whole series it`s maybe the best series to be ever made.I mean Rocky 1 is know as a true classic,Rocky 2 is know as a great sequel,Rocky 3 now he`s rich and famous but he`s still has the eye of the tiger,Rocky 4 USA hero vs a Soviet Fighter but Rocky still remains the champion,Rocky 5 the great ``talian Stallion``discovers his roots in the heart of Philadelphia and a great ending with all the memories of Rocky 1,2,3,4,and5.Rocky is a true american hero!"
4,The best,"Well, what a great early Christmas gift this was! I'm not a movie fan in general but the Rocky series is defintely endearing. 5 of the all-time best movies packaged in one set. Unbeatable. I own the VHS collection, so I'm probably even missing out on a few extras on the DVD set, but I can't complain.Seeing the original Rocky for the first time was incredible. It was a great film to watch, as it allowed me to piece together exactly how much Rocky had changed through the series, going from local Philly fighter to national megastar and back. An excellent ride indeed."
4,The come back kid box set,"Box set containing all 5 of the original rocky movies (minus the newest, sixth, movie releasted in 2006). This set is great if you just want to sit back and enjoy the movies themselves. These movies were produced in the 70s and 80s so like many other DVDs of movies of this time frame, the discs are not packed with special features or lots of extra like newer movies."
4,Rocky,The Movies are great. Just what I had hoped for. It took a while longer for the product to arrive than expected.
5,loved it,"after buying the final rocky, i bought the whole set for my husbands easter basket. he just loved it. and what a great price"
4,"Nice High Definition transfer, nonetheless","This box set is great. I'm OK with no real added bonus features. Picture and sound quality is always the most important thing to me about a movie on DVD.These movies do get less interesting with each follow-up release. Now, I'm hearing that there is going to be a ""Rocky VI"", simply called ""Rocky Balboa"" probably released in 2007.I don't know how this is going to work. If Sylvester Stallone choses to continue to play the roll as Rocky Balboa, what is Rocky going to be fighting this time? Diabetes?Just like his show, ""The Contender"", I think that this new movie (if Stallone still has the strength and comprehension to pull it off), may only be an indirect approach to try and re-sell the Rocky DVD back catalogue. That's american commercialism for you."
5,"Oh God, these movies are THE BEST!","Hello! I've seen Rocky's I-V and they are wonderful. The first 3 were great, the last two were eh, but they were still exciting. I must say that Rocky IV and V lacked the intensity and excitement of the first two, but I still get chills when I watch them. Sylvester Stallone is my favorite actor and he plays wonderfully. I LOVE the Rocky/Adrian romance, that is just wonderful! Go Rocky, Go Rocky! 5 STARS FOR THE ROCKY MOVIES BABY!"
5,Rocky Anthology,"It was a Xmas present for my husband, he said it was one of the best gifts he has ever gotten. Came out in great timing for the new Rocky Movie at the theathres.Thanks for a easy and great Xmas present for a Rocky fan............."
1,NO BONUS FEATURES,"Fans heed warning: If you're anything like me, you may have asked yourself, ""Since this is an updated box set from the LAST box set, what are the new features?"" Answer: NONE. No trailers, no deleted scenes, no outtakes, no featturets -- NOTHING. Only get this if you have a HD TV. If you're looking for ANYthing else, get the old box set. The old one was LOADED on the first film (though only had trailers on the rest). The only thing you get here are subtitles. I can't believe I sold my old set in anticipation for this thing. MGM stinks."
2,Not the correct set...,"The ""Rocky V"" movie was missing! Instead in it's place they put the 6th Rocky movie (which I already own). It may have said it in the description and I missed it, but still. I am disappointed they switched a movie out like that and sold it as the Anthology"
4,Good,One disc slight scratch. All the other discs and packaging were okay. Definetly worth the price of $18 since its impossible to find non-blue-ray in stores.
4,CASI LA COLECCION PERFECTA DE ROCKY,"Para los fans de Stallone y de las peliculas de Rocky en particular, siempre es un buena noticia una antologia de las mismas. La edicion de estas es mejor que en ediciones anteriores: excelente sonido y audio.Pero.. nada mas. Es decir, no podemos disfrutar de esos sabrosos extras que nos encantan a los verdaderos fans. Creo que la mayoria ya vio la saga de Rocky (TV o Cine), asi que nos novedad verlas de nuevo, asi que no hay mayor gracia tener unas copias mas aptas para alquiler que para un colecciniosta serio.Hay trailers, pero esos no cuentan.Seguiremos esperando ROCKY: ULTIMATE COLLECTION para algun dia."
4,Rocky's Rocks My Granddaughter,"My oldest granddaughter had seen the latest Rocky and enjoyed it so much that she was interested in seeing what preceded it. So I ordered the collection. She thoroughly enjoyed the earlier episodes, especially the first and third installments."
5,Great Set,"I ordered this set for my best friends step dad, who loves Rocky movies. He loved them. Great Set"
4,The Rocky Story,"Rocky - great movie, won an oscar for best picture and is totally motivating. totally worth the buy. Rocky 2 - decent sequel, but not necessary. cool ending. Rocky 3 - ok, thats enough already Rocky 4 - no, seriously... enough Rocky 5 - u get the point"
4,Satisfied,I bought this Box Set for my cousin for Christmas and although I have not watched the movies (or have any desire to watch them)he absolutely loved it!! It sure beats paying full price at a department store.
3,rocky anthology,"Rocky 3, & Rocky 4 does not play all that well (acts like it wants to skip, & speeds up)"
5,"""Win, Rocky, Win""",Excellent movies. Since the movies are classics you forget that the DVDs do not include extras. Nice packaging (good pictures). The sound (dolby 5.1 and Rocky1 was in DTS) and video quality (High Def. transfer) are excellent compared to the old VHS tapes that I owned. This collection is a must have for any Rocky fan.
5,Makalu Trekking Poles,"These are great! They help so much with stability and really do increase your work out. After I had knee surgery I did not feel at all confident on the more difficult or steep trails. After I bought these I could go much faster and much farther than I could with out. I was also pleasantly surprised at the workout my arms got, especially that difficult area on the back of the upper arm in women."
2,Interesting Commentary? Perhaps. Witty? Definitely Not!,"After having read the positive reviews, I was rather disappointed that this book fell flat of my expectations. While the concept is an appealing way to relate the changes in higher education, the book lacked the wit it promised to deliver. Often, the anecdotes seemed too simplistic and one-sided; the writing often seemed to lack subtlety and craftsmanship need to enhance the content. My one consolation: I did not buy this in hardback."
5,Dianne of Enfield,"This is an excellent romantic comedy about being able to go back in time and change the mistakes made in a previous relationship. It is extremely funny in places but at other times very sad. It stars that wonderful British actor Douglas Henshall(Angels and Insects) who plays the main character of Victor Bukowski. He is desperate to stop his ex girlfriend Sylvia from marrying another man. He is given a chance to go back in time change the mistakes he made in their relationship, but it doesn't quite work out as planned."
2,wasted time,This movie was very slow paced. It could of easily been a 30 minute show. I was very disappointed in it! Do not waste your time and money on it!!
4,Love's Passion,I think Deborah has a great voice! The content speaks for itself and is readily recognizable by any Bible reading Christian. The whole CD is spiritually uplifting & the songs are wonderful to sing along with.
2,Extreme obscurity,"This is not, as you might hope, a list of mildly exotic words that you could add to season your speech with precision and interest. Rather it is a collection of esoteric and obsolete words so obscure that no one without a dictionary (or even with many dictionaries) will be able to understand them."
1,I DONT WANT THE DVD,"Your first name is Sean, NOT john so you have no right to expect people to shell out this much for your very average music. How arrogant. NO option to buy just the music, you have to buy with a DVD. How come Beck just did this and charged half the price??? I am not paying this outrageous price for a DVD i could care less about."
1,Nepetism Sucks.....alot,"Dude, let me start off by saying that I HATE the beatles, and I HATE that hack Yoko Ono (as in oh,no...). That being said, I heard the piano solos on the homepage of his website, and I thought this CD would be cool....It's not.It sucks.This album is Horrible with a capital H. I'd be embarrassed to even print it, much less market it.Whatever you do, WHATEVER you do, DO NOT buy this album.Dude just sucks....but I think he'd be cool to have over to the house on a quiet evening with friends and just let him play his slow, soft piano music (which he offers none of on this CD)...he should stick to that and ONLY that.If you HAVE to buy a CD today off of Amazon, instead of this one, buy Apex Twin selected ambiant works vol.1.Much, MUCH cooler than this drivel."
5,A great CD stays with you...,"OK, Sean has given his fans a wonderfully melodic if melancholy treat here. I'll listen to it for a while, then put it in the drawer. When I am amassing CDs for my car or for a business trip, I ALWAYS find myself putting this one on the pile. THAT gives a CD 5-stars. More than one song will stay with you, and I love the chording on ""Dead Meat"" the best. Listeners will get their money's worth here, and the DVD is also really cool. I won't pick apart each song here as others probably have already, but if you were 'curious' about this CD (like I was), just BUY IT! You will wonder how you missed such great songs!"
3,Emitt is Back....,"Has anyone wondered what happened to Emitt Rhodes? The answer is that he changed his name to Sean Lennon and is back with a new cd. The melody lines, instrumentation and vocals (albeit weak and jazzily light in nature) are reminiscent of the great Paul McCartney sound-alike, Emitt Rhodes. How I can compare a McCartney sound-alike to a Lennon son is still haunting me, but the comparison is legit. This music is sweet and gentle, harmless for sure, but miles from daddy's vision and sincerity, not that that is a bad thing."
3,Back to Hamburg,"Sean has done a fine job on this considering we have the Bar raised high on our expectations . I believe he is a deep writer and thinker but (3) things are needed :(1) a Producer that is smarter than Pro tools .(2)Have Sean Move to Memphis on Beal Street (THE NEW HAMBURG)to Jam everynight for 3 months and record at Royal studios away from Yoko , Girly friends and all the Rich Trappings no cell phones , computers and NO Memphis Music Royalty .(3)Make sure he's worked on the writing to take it to the next level.He should get with his Brother to write as Julian's suffering will absolutely launch a #1. Something brillant is waiting if he makes it happen . John's blood must be stronger than Yoko's. We'll see!!!!!"
2,an average cd,"Sorry, but this is just an average cd that few will buy. Most buyers are Beatle freaks and I understand that. Nothing against Sean. I am sure he is nice guy and a kind person as is his mother whose musical talent he inherited. I am just not convinced music is his future. His voice seems to drone on and on. The songs are okay but nothing special. I bought this because of who his parents were. Nice to hear a couple of times. If he sticks with it he may grow as an artist. I hope so. His father wouldn't have Ms. Lohan involved in any projects, that's for sure."
1,Cringeworthy.,The songs themselves might be listenable with another vocalist. He has the vocal abilities of his mother.
1,hard to listen to but an effort for Sean,"I tried to listen to this one a few times and even watched the video. It did not move any mountains for me. The songs were an endless drone of the same note and same type of song for each track. Sean is definitely not a rocker and does not hold a candle to his big brother Julian who was born and raised in England and has a genuine British accent. Julian can sound like his father but he can change it up. Sean just drones on sounding like his father every note of the way and puts on a ""scouse like"" accent, when he was born and raised in New York City. However, he spent some time in Switzerland going to a private school. Some people call this album ""dream like"" but I call it depressing. Sean needs to rock it up and there is a LOT he can learn from Julian, even though their styles are a 180 degrees apart."
1,watery crap,"every song has the same whiney vocals. no fire, no balls. his dad and friends were total rocking loonies who took things from the mountain tops to the valley's. and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand it was pure unbridled raging passion that made the beatles so popular with planet earth. growing up around yoko was the final nail in the coffee for this unbridled passion that one lad from one lad from liverpool should recognise in his dad yet not be able to muster up in his own music. 1 star, back to the drawing board with ya and next time bring a little balls anger and sex drive to the scene. thank you"
3,"Sean Lennon's new album a ""Spectacle""","Friendly Fire is the newest record by Sean Lennon. Try not to look at him as John Lennon's son but instead think of him as an unique, emerging artist. The album is ten bittersweet songs about revenge, breaking up and hiding the cocaine? This feels like a winter album. The guitars are melancholic and the minimal string arrangements are just right for peering out of your 2nd floor apartment onto the bleak, cold streets. Well, I tried to forget about John when listening but ""Wait for Me"" is like ""I'm Only Sleeping"" Volume II. And ""Spectacle"" recalls some of George Harrison's best guitar solos. Lennon's voice is very thin and that is my only complaint, but it also fits the music really well most of the time. It comes with a DVD which has a music video for every song on the album and its all strung out in one big long video. Can we call this sleepy pop?Key tracks: ""Parachute"", ""Spectacle"", ""Headlights""By Brian Stinson"
5,So proud of his father's son,"Amazing, especially the opening track which Sean's performed on Letterman with a full string section. Strings on this record are superb and not too heavily arranged. The songwriting is just pop enough, not too pop. And the DVD is tres bon and shows some acting ability. I hope to see more of that."
5,Friendly Fire is a work of art,"This cd has not left my player since I got it, and the dvd is compelling and haunting. When I heard Sean Lennon's earlier work, I was not impressed, but I love every song on this cd. Some people complain about his naslly voice, but the feeling behind the voice and the artistry and depth of the music and videos are what captured me. Comparisons with his mom and dad are inevitable, but given his DNA, he speaks for himself. It's been a long time since I've heard music that satisfies my yearning for arrangements up to the standard of The Beatles and yet is new and exciting. Hope Sean continues to follow his muses."
5,Underrated album,"This is a beautifully written album. It may have low points -which may vary depending on each one's perspective(e.g. for me ""Tomorrow"" is a low in the album, but i know people who love it)The music arrengments are great, the quality is far superior than 99% of the current ""mainstream"" albums."
1,Shall We Dance Around The Truth,"Why would someone want to write such a mean spirited book about a beautifully talented actress and dancer who has brought so much joy throughout her life to others? Who would buy this book but a fan?... Save your money! Mr. Morley writes this book with cruel intentions, his facts can not be substantiated by anyone who is alive, so he can say whatever he pleases. Funny how he waited till the year she dies to get his nasty book published. If you already purchased the book like I did... you can cut out the nice pictures."
1,"Shall We ""Crap On Miss Rogers""","I should have listened to all the negative feedback in this forum on this item. Mr. Morley hasn't got a kind, or even fair, thing to say about his subject if he can't substitute something rotten for it. The entire ""biography"" is marred by mean-spiritedness (and isn't even entertaining on that dubious level). I say give it a wide berth."
5,SOY PARTIDARIA DE LA GASTRONOMIA,"DE LA BUENA MESA SIN IMPORTAR DE DONDE SEA LA COCINA: Francesa, oriental, alemana y en el caso de este recetario de cocina mexicana, ES DE LO MEJOR QUE PUEDES LLEVAR A TU MESA Y A TU BOCA !"
2,Sugar free doughnuts,I was not impressed with these doughnuts. They were not soft and did not taste very well.
3,Canon User,"This lens hood does it jobs as advertise. Many good points: Block light, Sturdy construction, felt liner for anti-reflect, look good, ...One very bad point: If the Circular Polarized Filter is to use, then there is a serious problem to rotate the filter if this lens hood is attached.Canon make this hood. Canon make the Circular Polarized Filter for this particular lens too. Canon did not think the combination of these two together in their design."
4,Plastic Costs How Much?,"I couldn't give this product lower than 4 stars because it does exactly what it advertises it does, protects your lens and helps shield unwanted light. I also could not give it 5 stars since I don't know what kind of crack Canon smokes to charge their customers as much as they do for a ring of plastic? Not a good way to build brand loyalty."
5,Worth the money,"I just purchased this hood for my Canon EF28-135 lens and it was well worth the money. Besides the improved quality of my daylight photos, it gives the lens a more professional look and does a great job of protecting my glass. I carry my camera around a lot in the city an it's great at protecting it from getting knocked around. I also like how I can reverse it at night or for storage.I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to protect their lens and improve the quality of daylight photos."
4,bought as a gift,"bought as a gift for a photographer, this is kind of a hard item to find, they were very pleased with this item"
5,Nice!,"5 stars because it deserves it. You could gripe all day that it should have been included, but the kit would have been that much more anyways. Its a high grade plastic, has the black felt, reverses for storage, and fits perfectly.I would recomend this hood to anyone that has this lens."
5,Good Fit,I bought the Canon brand to be sure of the fit and quality. It flips around securely for when its not in use.
1,lens hood,they just send what they have.They don't care if it''ll work with powershot sx 10 is or not.
3,The product does what it is intended for...nothing more.,"Photography is expensive, and paying a lot of money for a plastic ring is par for the course. The hood works, and I would recommend it, but it scores an average rating due to the product being simple but pricey."
5,Great hood as advertised,Protects lens and does its job of keeping stray light in. Takes up quite a bit of room but that's expected! =) A must have!
4,Good everyday lens - but not an L Lens,"Of the Canon consumer lenses the 28-135 MM may be one of their best and most useful lenses, a great value for the price: practical everyday focal range, good IS, fast focusing, quiet USM, and decent IQ. Lens build is not up to highest Canon standards--my lens has a little bit of shaky feel, but still operates well and USM works smoothely. I also have a 17 - 40 MM f/4 L and a 70 - 200 MM f/4L IS USM Canon lenses, which I are both incredible and superior. However until I can afford a $1,000+ Canon 24 - 70 MM f/2.8 USM L or 24 - 105 MM f/4 L IS telephoto, the 28 - 135 MM is a capable walk around lens.If you cannot afford the much more expensive Canon L mid rage telephotos--the 28- 135 is the next best thing. The EW78BII Lens hood is a useful accessory as is a good UV filter and B+W polarizer."
3,An Okay Read.,"This book was okay but it wasn't anything to write home about. I found one of the main characters, Kathleen, to be so obnoxious that I could hardly get through the book. It jumps around a lot so often times I'd find myself getting aggravated since the plot wasn't stable at all. The ending was sort of lame, but it wasn't a horrible read. I just wouldn't be running out to buy the book."
5,One of my favorite authors!,"Another chance to pick out another one by Wendi Corsi Staub! So glad to be able to find the ones I have gotten! Sent and delivered on time, and very nicely packaged! Thanks!"
2,Old News,Like the other say it's way outdated. It's time for a rewrite and edit to update the entire edition.
3,"Unoriginal, but action filled","Like much modern Hong Kong cinema, this film is wildly unoriginal, but has just enough action to keep you watching to the end. An accomplished cast makes the ride easier, but you have to wonder why so much talent appears in a film that cannot be described as anything more than mediocre."
5,ROSIE FROM BRADENTON FLORIDA,"I THINK ITS AMAZING THAT AFTER EVERYTHING THIS MAN HAS ENDURED, THAT HE WAS WILLING TO SHARE HIS STORY WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD.THE BOOK LIKE ITS AUTHOR IS TRUELY ONE OF A KIND, AND IAM TRUELY GRATEFUL TO JAMES MCKINLEY HIBBARD FOR TELLING HIS STORY, I THINK ALOT OF PEOPLE CAN LEARN ALOT FROM THIS BOOK."
4,Maison Ikkoku is my fave manga!,"It was great!Yusaku, a bumbling (but hot!) flunk-out college kid, is a tennant in an apartment, Maison Ikkoku. The tennants (Mrs. Ichinose,a hard drinking woman, Mr. Yotsua, a mysterious bachelor, Akemi, a night-shift waitress of Chachamari who spends her mornings in a see through nightie <AAA!>,Yusaku, and more) find themselves with a new apartment manager! Yusaku instantly falls in love with her (Kyoko is her name) and she well, I hope she likes him too.Join the fun! Read them all! BWA HA HA HA(as Mrs. Ichinose would say)! I'm hooked on it! It is the BEST manga I've ever read!"
4,Definetly a good story,"I liked Maison Ikokku, but I don't feel it really can compare to Ranma 1/2. Rumiko Takahashi is definetly my favorite manga author/illustrator, but some of her work outshines others. Seriously, how can you compare a story about a boy who likes an older woman whose husband died to a boy and girl who were engaged by their parents but the boy is engaged to two other girls and when he gets splashed with cold water he becomes a girl! Come on! I mean, don't get me wrong, i like Maison Ikokku and will continue to read it, but before looking into it, maybe you should get yourself familiar with some other of Rumiko Takahashi's work..."
5,My Favorite Manga,"Maison Ikkoku is my favorite manga series, hands down. It is very character driven, with lots of laughs and some very touching moments. The personalities of Maison Ikkoku change over the course of the series, and are very well rounded. This is a nice change from ""one-joke"" characters and plots. The full story is a very rewarding read. Godai and Kyoko 's feelings are true and deep. This is by far the most honestly romantic manga I have read.This first volume introduces all of the main characters and sets up some of the running jokes. A house full of happy drunks keeps the comic from becoming too sappy, and their are plenty of romantic rivals for everyone's affections. The book takes off in full soap opera swing with wacky hijinks and misunderstood intentions. Is bumbling ronin Godai and challenge for the glinting teeth of wealthy Coach Mitaka? I sure hope so."
2,"Good, but not great","Here we have one of those choices between great sound and great performance. This 1950 broadcast is wonderful, yes, but there is little humor in the performance; only Cloe Elmo as Dame Quickly sounds like she's having any fun. On the other hand, the astounding 1937 Salzburg performance--now newly-remastered with quite acceptable sound (see: Toscanini - The Salzburg Experience, Vol. 4, Falstaff)--has life, wit and whimsy along with outstanding singing. Also, Dino Borgioli, the Fenton on the Salzburg set, is the best on records, while the singer in this 1950 performance is quite terrible.If you want a good performance you will listen to a few times, buy this version. If you want a timeless performance that will reveal new hidden beauties every time you put it on, spend the extra $10 for the ""Salzburg Experience."""
4,The Lullaby Album,"Azure Ray to me sounds a lot like- Maria Taylor's songs. Both who remind me of The Late,But Great Elliott Smith. Soft voice singing tunes are upbeat and beautifully sad, but true story telling lycrics."
3,It's okay. About an average cookbook,"The most valuable information is not necessarily the recipes, but the reference material at the beginning. He does a lot of Middle Eastern cooking, which reflects his heritage."
1,Not Good. Not good at all...,"If you only buy one book this year, make it something else. Anything else. Except perhaps for ""Touched, The Jerry Sandusky Story."" Otherwise you will subject yourself to ordained minister Jeff Smith's preachy, stilted prose, untested recipes, and misinformation ( e.g.""hot pan cold oil food won't stick"" ""wine cuts down on salt"" ""sear the meat to seal in the juices"" and ""don't buy Japanese knives"" come to mind).Smith parlayed his God-Boy status by opening his version of The Second Mile (a man-of-the-cloth themed restaurant-cum-halfway-house) which supplied him with fresh boys to molest. He'd trot them out regularly on his PBS show (""I'd like to to meet my little friend Timmy"") and traveled the book-signing circuit with his 20-something ""sous chef"" (French for boy toy) Craig Wollem. With any luck he is burning for eternity in Hades right now."
1,Pages Missing,"The book was advertised as excellent condition and yet several pages were missing. I guess that is the hazard one faces in purchasing used books, but it's still pretty sad."
2,"It's OK, but his ""American"" cookbook is better","Though I love his show, this book does not seem to have the outstanding qualities I expect from Jeff Smith. You would be better advised to purchase his ""Frugal Gourmet Cooks American"". THAT one is a treasure."
5,Great Biber CD!,"I'm surprised more copies of this recording are not available on Amazon! This is an excellent interpretation of eight of Biber's works written between 1673 and 1680 (Sonata Jucunda may have been written by Schmelzer). The performance by Combattimento Consort Amsterdam is top notch, and they manage to bring Biber's humor front and center on this SA disc. Their version of Battalia is a bit abbreviated, but this is still a highly recommended CD. If you are a Biber fan, and I have recordings of over 110 of his works, I promise this will not disappoint."
4,Pleasant change-up in your holiday music,"A cute little christmas album.If you like lite classical or classical pop, you'll probably get a real kick out of this quaint little 1986 offering by the Hampton String Quartet. The arrangements are all offered in a serious way - what if all these Xmas tunes were given a classical string quartet arrangement? The efforts range from the predictable to the outstanding (The faux-fugal arrangement of DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR? is a high point).The MOZART in the title is somewhat misleading, though. Warren Schatz (producer) attempts different classical styles (in his wish for ""The perfect Christmas album"") besides old ""Wolfy."" WHITE CHRISTMAS is a bit more Beethoven-y than Mozartian, and THE CHRISTMAS SONG is definately in a Debussey vein.If you can find this one for a decent price, snap it up.Originally on the RCA Red Seal Digital label."
5,I never get tired of this CD,"I bought the cassette version of this in 1986 to play for my newborn son to help him get to sleep. I've been playing it (and loving it) every Christmas since. Now the tape is worn out and I MUST purchase the CD. The music is beautiful, relaxing, and I never get tired of hearing it play over and over at Christmastime. It's wonderful background music when I'm decorating the tree or having friends and family over during the holidays. And like Bugs Bunny helped us to appreciate classical music without us even realizing it, this collection has helped my son to appreciate Mozart from the time he was born."
5,Best Xmas CD ever.,We wore out the tape then searched for the CD. It was a happyday when the parcel arrived from Amazon!
5,Get this and have a Merry Little Christmas,"Another great job !! Great addition to their other offerings. Plays in background, sets mood without competing for spotlight and center stage"
1,NOT a Nikon Product. Misleading Product Title,"This is NOT a Nikon UC-E4. It is a MISLEADING product title and MISLEADING 'savings' claim. The genuine Nikon product may retail for $60, but this thing NEVER sold for that amount. The savings claim is phony. Amazon ""Sellers"" area is turning into eBay."
1,"its just a plain usb cable, but not the Nikon UC-E4 USB Cable","its just a plain usb cable, but not the Nikon UC-E4 USB Cableif i knew, i would have just gone to chinatown and bought it there for less, and would not have had to wait for delivery"
1,not the real thing,"I read the other reviews prior to ordering this cable and was concerned about the authenticity of this product. I placed the order and hoped for the best. Upon receiving the cable I was disappointed to see it is a ""knock off"" brand USB cord, not a real Nikon cord. It does not have the ferrite cores nor is it made by Nikon. I don't doubt that it will work, but I do like to get what I ordered."
2,Wrong product,Unfortunately I will be returning this product because it does not fit my camera. Nothing wrong with it. Just doesn't fit. Sorry
2,This cable does not work with my D3100 Nikon camera,This cable does not work with my D3100 Nikon camera. It does not recognize the camera.I am not sure whether the cable in not good or it does not recognize D3100 camera.I read that it will work with that camera but it doesn't.I have to return this cable and buy another one from Nikon through Amazon.Please suggest which one to purchase that will work with D3100 Nikon Camera.
1,This is NOT what I ordered.,"I am very unhappy with my product, the cord I received is NOT what I ordered and is not what is shown in the picture. I am VERY unhappy."
3,Nice but not what is pictured,"Everything went as planned, fast and nicely priced. But the picture shows the ferret (the knob looking thing near the end). I had one so it worked just fine for me. But you'll have to arrange for one as this one was shipped with one. Still love amazon because once again it all came together, and quicker than promised."
5,Great Lotion!,This has been my favorite moisturizing lotion for years. I will continue to buy here since it is the best price!
1,Not happy with this lotion,"Was not very happy with this lotion, I am a big fan of Australian Gold but not sure what is up with this after tanning lotion. It seemed my tan did not stay as long as it did when I was using a different lotion."
5,Franklin,This is the the best skin lotion I've ever purchased. I put in on right after a shower. Then again when I get back home after tanning. In the winter I'll put it on even more often. It is great for the skin and most certainly enhances the appearance of one's tan. Will purchase again.
5,Excellent Lotion,I've been buying this product for years. I use it after a day at the beach and it feels great plus smells good too. My husband likes it as much as I do!!!
2,Over-priced moisturizer,"For the price, I had hoped that this product would be something special. I found that it's no more moisturizing than products you buy at the drugstore. I won't buy this again. Besides, like the tanning accelerator, the scent is obnoxious."
5,"Goes on smooth, no residual stickiness/film","Got this product as a substitute for aloe vera for when I get sunburned. I can't stand the sticky feeling aloe gel leaves behind, so I was looking for something else. This is the ticket!It goes on smooth, has a semi- to moderate coconut smell that is characteristic of Australian Gold products, and dissipates very quickly. It will keep you from peeling after a long day in the sun, which probably helps in maintaining a tan. I cannot really speak to that claim of the product, but it beats other lotions for this and daily use, as well as aloe vera."
5,After-Tan Lotion,This product is amazing for use after tanning to help preserve color or to lock in moisture after a shower. Goes on smooth with no oily feeling. I smell like an orange creamsicle when I wear this. Yum. I adore it!
5,Great!!!,This is the best lotion I have ever found!!! Got the first bottle in Florida and could not find any here?? I finally found the lotion on amazon and I am very happy!
3,Not really for the advanced tanner,"First off i must say how much I love the way it smells (orangy, beachy). I would use it when summer comes around and you're at the beach every weekend. But since i started going to a tanning salon i realized this cream wasn't cutting it, my skin was drying out. So if ur an advanced tanner like me I recommend spending a little more money on a higher quality after-tan moisturizer. But if ur not, you will absolutely love the way this lotion just glides onto your skin, and it doesn't feel greasy at all!"
4,Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender 16 oz. Pump,First time user of this product...smells great....not oily....why pay high end retailers for a small bottle of moisturizer for triple the price.
3,Okay kung-fu fare,"Gordon Liu stars in a this garbled tale of China vs. Japan. The film attempts to mix comedy with martial arts, but falls short. Liu's fights are impressive, but come few and far between in this movie."
2,Don't buy unless you collect G.Liu movies,"The fighting scenes were fair. The ending seemed to have been cutoff prematurely with no credit roll or anything. It was a budget priced movie so I shouldn't have expected much. Although Tai Seng is the largest distributor, I don't think I'm going to buy another DVD from them again."
1,"Very bad, basically garbage",I only know of one good movie with Gordon Liu which is the Shaolin Master Killer. Guns and martial arts don't mix and they have both in this movie.
4,Very Good,"This book made statistics easier and less esoteric.This book is organized into 13 chapters and is a little expensive.Contains a lot of charts, figures, graphs, diagrams and some pretty pictures too(some of them seem to be out of place).Salient features -1) Excellent coverage of sampling & Estimation, and more importantly Hypothesis testing(very comprehensive).2) Several solved problems.3) Several exercises/problems for you to solve/learn from.4) Many typos/printing mistakes/goof-ups.5) Very detailed in approach.6) Funny.Realy a HEAVY first course in statistics."
4,Stats made easy,Good learning tool. easy to follow. I am definitely not a math geek or a mathematician; however this book was easy to follow
2,A Student,"I took a Statistics couse with one of the authors (Smidt), and this was the reference book (for 500 level). It was a MINITAB course instead a really statistical course."
5,This CD smokes!,One of the best Smooth Jazz compilations ever! Possibly the greatest addition to your CD collection. This CD should be your next purchase.
2,Overpriced,"This holder works great, but is a piece of a pvc pipe, and the bottom is holded with a cable strap, truly overpriced."
5,American poetry anthology,My father read poetry to me daily when I was a child. He would have loved this book.Thanks to him I now know many of the great American poems by heart.
1,abysmal (and not in a good way),"This movie is terribly written, directed, designed, lit, acted and scored. To call it ""amateurish"" would be a compliment it doesn't deserve. If anyone wants to see what a REAL artist can create on a shoestring budget, look at NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. No laughs here (even unintentional ones), and no suspense. Actual rating, if possible, would be Zero stars."
5,Best reference book on manufacturing,Outstanding book on the basics in manufacturing . Very easy to read. Strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in Manufactuing.
2,How to use a knife in a fight,This video teache you how to use a knife in a fight.If you seek info on how to defend yourself against un opponent with a knife and how to nutralize him... this video is not for you.How ever there is good info on what kind of attack you can expect to face if you ever encounter a experienced knife fighter.
3,Restocking fee? Bah Humbug!!!!,"I purchased these items as Christmas gifts. Hopefully, the recipients will like them and they will want to keep them. It wasn't until after I made my purchase that I discovered that the seller charges a ""restocking fee"" for returns. No company that wants to be in the business of internet sales should charge that type of fee. I will not make another purchase from them for that reason alone. Imagine if you will taking a present back to the store and they charge you a ""restocking fee"" to put it back on the shelf. Would you shop at that store again?Amazon is great. Amerileather? Bah Humbug!!!!"
3,Thick Pulsar,I was surprised about the thickness of watch when I had it in my hands for the first time. Although the watch sits nicely in your arm. I am happy with the special features of the watch.
4,Functional and Value For Money,"Due to my employment I travel extencively, this time piece has in the short time I have owned it forefilled all the requirements I require of a functional time piece at a very competetive price. I would recommend Pulsar as a manufacture to any body reqiring quality and style. At this moment in time I have 4 Pulsar time pieces that I use on a regular basis, 3 are working /daily use sports watches and I have a dress watch for when I am entertaining / partying. None of these watches have ever let me down, I have them regularly, serviced and new seals every time the batteries are changed, regular diving and swimming trips have never caused any problems. My one slight critisium would be the digital read out on this model is a little pale and could do with slightly altering the contrast, however it remains an excellent time piece - Highly recommended"
2,Digital Died,I bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price. That is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch. But I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Too Heavy and Big,"I usally like a big sports watch on my hand. Wow.. This is too big and heavy. It has got some good features, but the weight of the watch outweighs the good features.The band is not at all flexible and it was not strapping around my hand, but was choking my wrist on two sides. Intolerable."
3,Get used to using your backlight,"Overall the watch is fairly simple to use. However the display is very dull(almost like the battery is about to die). The picture of the watch shown, shows a much brighter display, that is not the case. The Backlight does improve the ability to see the display but it could be brighter as well. This watch retailed for $235.00(maybe priced decreased because of display) and other than the LCD it is a great watch and made of high quality and easy to use."
2,Poor digital display,"Attractive watch, comfortable, but digital display is too faint, out in daylight digital display difficult to read."
2,nice watch - abit hard to use,"Maybe I have grown used to using Casio wathces, but I find this watch difficult to use and set. The watch looks good I have been complimented on it, it is hard to use the various features."
3,Disappointing,"I purchased this watch because I very much like the digital/analog combination. I frequently use a digital for the stop watch function, for day/date, etc. I have seen and own other combinations where the digital display is just too small to read quickly. I liked the fact that this display is relatively large. Unfortunately, it is not easy to read because it is too faint. This is so even when using the backlight. Since the digital display was so central to my reason for buying it, I decided to send it back."
2,Great features.. Way too bulky..,"All the good things people mentioned are true. Nice features, digital + analog, gives current time for 71 cities or more. But it's only good to look at this watch in the pictures.. If you don't care a heavy and bulky piece of equipment hanging on your wrist, then probably you could buy it. There are better options for the price I believe. Think again. If you are buying this as a gift for someone else, Then either he is 'big' or you just want to buy 'something' in a hurry. Don't do it."
2,"Great title, poor execution","The main concept to take out of this book and the only one I felt I could use was - there are some elements of our world that we cannot measure and Western science falls short in this regard. It tries to be a unifying book, which brings science and spirituality together the way ""The Tao of Physics"" did. It falls far short. It is long-winded, boring and overblown with details. It is not unified nor the case for the principles that would unify synchronicity to other aspects of science put in any manner the reader could follow. I was compelled to buy the book simply because the title was too intriguing. Sorry, some good bits here and there, but not worth the read."
4,Well-received,This product was delivered in a timely manner and was just as the description had listed... Positive purchase experience.
2,Yuk.,I bought this book based upon the excellent reports others gave it. I cannot be so generous. I found the book to be an exercise in the authors intelligence making the book almost unreadable to me. I just wanted to know what this subject was and how it applied to the world. I'm still reading and have not found out.Jimmy
2,You get what you pay for.,"I had used Exambusters study cards in high school as a way to inexpensively prepare for the Verbal section of the SAT. Many words contained vague definitions, and a few had incorrect parts of speech. But I thought that was an isolated incident and that their MCAT cards would be much better. I was wrong. Like someone else said, the set contained too many useless cards (plant biology) and too few helpful cards (not enough organic chemistry cards!). In short, my sister could have put together a better set using her high school biology notes."
4,Not the best but good enough,"I took the MCAT many years ago before many of the changes it has undergone over the past few years. That said, I felt that these review cards were really usefull for test preparation. Certainly they are not meant to be primary study tools, and of course they lack the detail needed to learn the grand scheme of things. But for a fast/portable reference tool, nothing beats these things. I used them mostly to jog my memory and to fill in gaps in my knowledge base. I would take a stack of 50 or so and review them while I was waiting in traffic, during my break at work, or while on the bus/train ride to school. They are portable and you can go through them really quickly. It would be a waste of time to use these as a primary study tool or to spend hours on end memorizing and scrutinizing them, but as a quick reference, they work great.Used in the appropriate manner, these can be an invaluable tool to raise your score."
2,Ace's Exambuters MCAT Study Cards,These cards are too general! They also lack the crucial organic chemistry. Don't waste your time.
2,Not really worth the time,"I was not impressed with these cards. They offer an incomplete review of only select basic material. Plus, the cards are too tiny and flimsy. I looked at them a few times and then never used them again. These types of flash cards are only useful if you need a few quick facts... not explanations. Also, I found a few errors on the cards... Charles' and Boyle's Law.... Better look that one up instead."
2,Very basic !!! Not good MCAT preparation.,"The cards covered a large portion of the material from the basic science classes but none were detailed or challenging. Some were almost laughable. For instance one of the cards asks what is the cell membrane. Lots of questions of this calliber.Anyone preparing for medical school needs more challenging cards. These seem more appropriate for a high school student honestly.The cards will probably help if you haven't taken sciences in a while or are just starting to study, but otherwise pass these up."
1,Horrible. Will lower your MCAT SCore,"They are that bad. They give terms with vague definitions, and it's just bad. Will frustrate you. Is not worth your time. I promise."
3,"Good, but not his best stuff.","I am a HUGE Jonn Serrie fan and own most of his CDs. His music always takes me some place wonderful. I was really looking forward to Epiphany and the anticipated spiritual journey. I must admit, however, that this CD just doesn't do much for me. The covers of familiar hymns seem very formulaic (slow it down and blow air into it), and not very inspired or creative. My favorite song on the CD is the one Serrie wrote (Light of Thy Countenance). Fortunately the CD ends with the best two songs, which comprise roughly a third of the playing time."
5,Heaven's Music,If I were to imagine the ever-present musical vibrations that I believe will be in heaven I would imagine the sound to be something like Mr. Serrie created on this album. My only wish is that he would do more hymns in this style. I have no idea what his beliefs are but certainly God has touched him with talent. I found his music on Nexus Radio - station Cryosleep and immediately looked on Amazon for MP3s of his music.
3,Far from vintage Roth,"I'm a big Philip Roth fan. I love his lush prose, the endless sentences that wind their way around an idea and bring the reader effortlessly along. I love how he can recreate a time and place in meticulous detail. I love the sense of history he weaves into his work.Having said all that, you'll find none of it in ""Deception."" I haven't read all Roth's work--was this a literary experiment? This book is far form lush, far too much effort to read. I quickly became tired of going back and rereading, trying to figure out who was speaking, who the characters were, even where events were taking place. It did get better after awhile, and the layers of deception revealed at the end were clever indeed. But ultimately I was disappointed. My next step is to get another of Roth's novels that I can really sink my teeth into."
2,not as good as others he's written,American Pastoral - wow! i wish that i could write like that.The Human Stain - wow! againand then i tried to read Deception and i couldn't finish it - it's like ok i understand that your jewish - i get the picture already!
4,Fantastic!,"I love Lingua Latina, and I love the workbook. But I only gave it 4 stars because there ARE a few mistakes in the workbook, and it is missing an answer key (sometimes... u just REALLY wanna know if you're right...). Overall, though... I would still recommend it to anyone."
5,Superb,This book is really useful and helpful in learning Latin. It's well-structured and repetitive enough to help you remember things without being dull. For additional reading practice I likedLingva Latina - Via Latina: Easy Latin Reader (Latin Edition)which has graded texts and plenty of footnotes.
3,Harley Davidson Border,"I bought 3 rolls of this border for my son's room thinking that because the description says it is 180"" long I would have more than enough to do the whole room. I ended up about 3 feet short because it is no where near that long and now I need to order another roll and pay shipping on this again so that I can finish the room. I am very dissapointed that the length printed on the label is so off. If it would have been a little short I would have been fine but almost 4 feet short per roll is rediculas!! I am spending the money to pay for another roll and shipping for what I was informed was already there. The border its self is great and looks really good I just wish I would have known it was shorter than what they said."
4,The 3rd Ed. is based on Mathematica 5.1,"This book is an excellent introduction to Mathematica. It is based on Mathematica 5.1 and hence bring the 2nd Ed. based on Mathematica 2.2 up to date to the most recent version of this software package. The book covers all aspects of programming functionalities available in Mathematica: procedural, functional, recursive, rule-based, and object-oriented. There are ample examples in science and mathematics as well as devising one's own software packages. The emphasis of the book is on the fundamental programming concepts. While there are examples of complete packages that solve specific problems more emphasis in this direction would even further strengthen the book."
3,just different,"I recently read Just Kids by Smith and was wowed. That doesn't happen often so I became increasingly interested in her other works and music. While the book has the same hypnotic writing I had hoped for something similar to Just Kids. I am impressed with all her work, talent and will continue to look for all works by Smith."
5,My Family S2,Fantastic British sitcom. It keeps me laughing the whole time for every episode. I reccomend this to anyone who loves to laugh.
5,Fantastic Show!!!,"I also find it odd that AMAZON does not distribute this fabulous program. It is the funniest thing on television (if you can get BBC America). I've given up on American televison; we just don't have good comedy writers anymore. Many of the episodes have me in tears they're so funny. Maybe AMAZON UK carries all of the episodes; I certainly hope so. Fantastic writing, directing and performances by all of the stars--even the guest stars."
4,Great sharing experience book,"This book is really useful for who study architecture, sometime there were some stories behind the architect that we didn't know, and always wonder how and why they approach to their design work. Nice to know this book, it helped me a lot in doing researching also!Nice, strongly recommending!"
1,TOO MUCH,I just got the Big Momma jumbo lighter and I only paid $9.99 for it. I can't believe they want $75 for this one. YOU CAN FIND THEM CHEAPER
2,Good sound,"I have perhaps six performances of these concerts (Nicolet, Rampal, Adorjan, Gallois etc.) for I'm very fond of C. P. E. Bach music. I have to say that, notwithstanding the famous Galway's sound, this is not the performance I prefer and the Orchestra is not so good according my taste."
4,A successful foray into the old West of the 1800s,"Two out-of-the-ordinary men, forever on the road, intent on helping to bring peace and order to newly created towns in the West. Cole and Hitch get notice from the Aldermen of the Town of Appaloosa that their help is needed. Upon their arrival, Cole and Hitch firmly set down their written rules that they govern by. The Aldermen are a bit reluctant to agree to their unorthodox ways but relent. A rebel rancher, Randall Bragg and his men have terrorized the town, taking whoever and whatever they want, for too long. Cole, as the new Marshal, is determined to bring Bragg to justice for killing his predecessor. He never expected his relationship with Allie French to complicate his life and his work. Their skills and their fortitude come into play as they track down Bragg who escapes from their custody. Hitch is forever devoted to Cole leaves Town without him. Appaloosa is an enjoyable, easy read."
4,Parker can still suprise,"Okay, I was expecting Spenser in a cowboy hat, and I was wrong.The main characters had their own unique viewpoints, and they made choices that suprised - right up to the end of the book.With Parker's sparse style, this book takes no more than an evening to read. So, I'd hardly recommend spending money on it new. But, if you can get the book used or at a library (as I did) you won't regret it. Parker was at one time a very gifted writer, and he hasn't completly lost the gift."
4,Fine Western,"I am not a great Western fan, however, reading about the new movie with Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen, based on Robert B. Parker's novel, I had to check out the book; and I was not disappointed. The characters were developed and drew me straight into the story. The storyline, while predictable, was always engaging. Best of all were the dialogs between Hitch and Virgil, sparse yet utterly entertaining.The subtraction of one star is for the somewhat disappointing and strange ending.Although the movie was quite enjoyable, it did not do the book justice. If you have only seen the movie, buy or borrow the book and read it. You should not be disappointed."
4,The Old West thru a Parker shaped filter,"I'm a long time Parker fan and even had a chance to meet himsometime back. In my view, he's one of our greatest living writers and the Spenser series simply has to rank as one of the finest detective series ever.After reading everything he's written in the last thirty or soyears it's hard not to see some familiar themes come up throughout the books.Honor, friendship, commitment, and love are all Parker mainstays and some people would say cliches.You could make a case that the characters of Cole and Hitch areSpenser and Hawk in different clothes. (Or Gus and Call from Lonesome Dove ,for that matter) All that aside, Parker has written a gritty, straight foward tale of the West with his usual ear for dialogue, humor , and compassion. No surprises for Parker fans like myself but, a good, strong book about people doing the right thing and standing up for what they believe in."
5,My First Robert Parker Read,"I picked this book up at a drug store of all places on discount, when purchasing I thought it would be a dud but for the price I could not go wrong. Well I was wrong, this was one of my most enjoyable reads of 2009! Robert B Parker brings the characters alive in Appaloosa, a wonderful surprise!"
4,Appaloosa,I purchased this book for my husband. He has read some of the others by Robert Parker and he sure enjoys his writing. I would purchase any of these story lines for my husband and know he would enjoy them.
3,"A fast read, decent western","Short, fast chapters make this novel feel more like a tv show to me than anything else, but does led to a quick read. I finished it in one afternoon. These quick chapters I feel also led to little character development through the story, somewhat of a let down for me. Also, I never got to the point where I liked Cole enough to care what happened to him.The story was good and kept the focus clear and apparent, never straying too far. I did feel the ending was a bit anti-climatic and rushed, but finally seeing Everett step from Cole's shadow made the last two pages the best in the whole book."
3,Like Louis L'Amour,"If it wasn't for the F-word, this could've been written by the late Louis L'Amour."
5,Appalosa,"I think it would be fair to say that Appaloosa is a ""lolapalooza"" of a yarn! One of his best, a western with a plot that twists and turns every few pages. I thought it was going to be another Spencer novel and was initinally disappointed, but having bought it I was going to read it and so glad that I did...."
3,Great Western Story,"As a rule, I usually don't read westerns as a rule. But when Robert B Parker wrote this. I had to answer the call. Basically The Bad Guy Braggs rules the town with an iron fist kills anyone who dares oppose him. That is until the good guys show up. There is the appearance of Allie French which makes the story exciting. If you like westerns check this out."
2,Gunfight at the Not-So-OK Corral,"""Laconic"" may be a favorable description of a Western hero, but it should not apply to the book which tells that hero's story. This is a poor effort by an otherwise talented writer. The big gunfight is a poor rip-off of the OK Corral tale, the characters are not well developed, and the book ends with a thud. The only good thing about the short chapters and wide spacing is that the reader has wasted less time with this hollow core of what should have been a good story. Read ""Ride the Dark Trail"" to see what a Western should be."
3,Entertaining western,"I found this book very entertaining. As many reviewers have pointed out, these are stock characters (the loner, silent anti-hero marshall, the loyal, compentent sidekick, etc.), but characters become stock for a reason. If you like westerns, you will be instantly at home in this story.I liked the spare, minimalist prose. I liked the plot. What I did not like was the abrupt ending. Were it not for that, I would have given it 4 stars."
5,Yada Yada Story!,Turn off the TV. Don't open the newspaper. Forget about the radio. You are now in the presence of a wonderful story!
3,See it at the Library,"Again, like my review of the movie, it is really 3 and one-half stars. . .This was the first Robert B. Parker book I've ever read cover to cover. Yes, despite all the Spenser books out there, I never read one, though I was a fan of the TV Show, Spenser for Hire. I obtained a used Hardback version.The book gives you some background into the two main characters the movie doesn't offer, the inner working of Everett's vision of the events. Without distraction, the book is what I would call a ""fast read,"" that is you move along at a good pace, so it doesn't really take long to read it. Most of the chapters are short, two or three pages in the hardcover book I have.Being the first RBP book I've ever read (I will consider getting Gunman's Rhapsody from my local library sometime) I don't want to linger on the book, and his writing style too much. I'm actually still forming an opinion."
4,Eye Candy,"This easy reading book made a recent trans-ocean flight fly by (no pun intended). Falls into my ""Eye Candy"" category. Easy to read, occupies a few hours and no expectations for great lit, but decent writing. Great book for vacation reading."
1,the same old stuff,"I like the Spencer books by Mr. Parker, but it seems that the reviewers may not have read his Spencer books. Apaloosa has the same three characters as the Spencer books but they are just shuffled around. Virgil Cole is Hawk and Everett is Spencer. Allie is simply Susan with a slightly altered personality. There isn't much fresh material here, more violence and swearing but that is about it. If you have read one or two Spencer books then you have already read Apaloosa."
2,What kept me going...,"What kept me going on this book comes down to two points...1) I did want to know what happened in the end.2) The book was so easy to read fast...I felt like I was not losing out on my time.Number two was probably the problem. I went into this story with high expectations. I saw Ed Harris on late night T.V. sometime last year, and he said that he wanted to make this book into a movie. I admit, this is my first Parker novel-but it will be my last. The writing style is not for me. I feel like if he left out the f-word and the sex-this could have been a pre-teen story. Also too much ""Cole said"" ""Virgil said"", it really disrupted the flow of the story for me.I gave the two stars because the story was ok-although I have seen Tombstone and this was definately parallel to that one. But hey, if you do not mind blowing the 2-4 hrs it takes to read this book-go ahead."
2,Where was Bragg?,"Would someone please tell me why this book was even published? Oh - that's right - the author is a bestseller. If a new writer submitted this book the publisher/editors (assuming there are any actual editors) would have asked, ""Where is the bad guy? He appears throughout the book, but there is no character development whatsoever. Please read ""Lonesome Dove"" (see: Blue Duck); also ""The Stand"" (see: The Walkin' Dude); also ""The Possessed (Stavrogin) to learn how to create a truly believable, evil villain. A book like this needs someone we can really hate, and love to see our heroes destroy. Otherwise, this is just a pleasant little book about a male-bonding, not an iconic western worthy of our time."" I have a feeling the film will be better. It has great stars; but will it have great character development, especially the character of Bragg? Certainly not, if the book is any proof."
1,"""Paint-By-Numbers"" Western","A disappointing and disjointed series of ""cowboy"" vignettes -Un-developed characters plodding through an un-fulfilled plot arriving at an un-satisfactory ending......."
4,If you're a Parker fan you won't be disappointed,"When a writer has forty or fifty titles to his credit you realize he has a fairly substantial reader base. I've only recently discovered him. I wasn't a big fan of the Spencer TV series but I do like the Jesse Stone adaptations. Parker writes with a crispness that brings you along at a pace you might not be accustomed to. Before you have a chance to decide if you like this style or not, you have a hundred pages invested. His stories are not overly embelished with unnecessary wordage - no glorious sunsets, no flowery gardens, just a constant, steady progression towards a non-judgmental conclusion. It's only when you've finished that you think, 'I really enjoyed that.' Appaloosa is a prime example. Characters carefully developed, plot clearly laid out, dialog curt and to the point. It may not be his best, but I don't think I've read his best quite yet. But I'll keep reading his stuff until I find it. And so will you."
3,The cheapest color is Black on Gold,I love my $25 Brother label maker. The first day I was busy for hours until I ran out of tape. I wouldn't have chosen this color if it wasn't the cheapest one sold through Amazon.grb
5,"Finally, a book from the expert",It's good to finally have an all-in-one explanation of photon maps. Everyone should implement one!
5,Worked fine,"This item worked fine. It was easy to install with the proper specialty socket, and lot less expensive than other vendors."
2,Doesn't Fit,I purchased a Bosch Oxygen Sensor # 13540 for a 2003 Toyota Rav 4. The sensor male plug doesn't fit into the femal portion. The vehicle failed NJ State Inspection. The MIL stayed on showing the sae code for this particular sensor P1135. I probably have to get a new electrical connection for both sides.
5,Excellent Environmental Guide,What a wonderful resource for parents to ensure that their children can grow up normally. Only wish the authors would issue a revised addition with updated content.
4,its ok,i was thinking of buying this i dont no it looks cool and im notgoing for power on this gun i gust whant something to mesarond with in the back of my home but i dont no
1,ewww,dont buy this gun unless you want it for looks. it shoots about 10fps and shoots about 20ft. it comes with a flashlight. but it mine didnt work even with new batteries.
3,Expensive but necessary,"Does what it's supposed to, even on 3rd party 72mm macro lenses like the Sigma 180mm macro. Expensive but you do need it if you want to mount your ringflash or twinlite on larger diameter macro lenses."
5,Baby Instruction Manual,I love this book and cannot recommend it enough. It is the closest thing you will find to getting a set of instructions with your newborn.
2,Excellent New Parent Resource,This book is a valuable resource and updated with details you will not find anywhere else.Well written and carefully researched it complements author's earlier books and adds to the important resources every new parent should have. Kudos to authors.
1,They lie in the opening message.,"In the opening message the authors claim they will present the various options to you so you can decide for yourself. They lie. The authors are quite clearly anti-medication for pain, pro-breast feeding, and for having your child sleep in your bed. They also helpfully tell you how awful you will feel and look afterwards, and how it will negatively affect your marriage if you have one. They are anti-physician and modern medicine.It is also natural to feel pain when you get a bullet wound. People don't give you a hard time for pain medication for that!"
1,Don't Bother,I loved the Great Expectations pregnancy book so much that I bought this one also. I highly recommend the pregnacy one. Unfourtnately I wish I had my money back for this one. This book contains pages upon pages of repetitive information from the pregnancy book and gave me very little information on my sons development which was my main interest. The free development updates I get from the baby sites online are more entertaining. Buy this book if you don't have the pregnancy book.
4,it's a great vampire flick,"This is a fun vampire flick. And I think pretty well done, if a bit campy - but that's part of the charm!WHEN will it be released on DVD??? I want it for my collection and videotape is sooooo last century."
3,You'd never guess...,"Beautiful to look at, but idiotic. The book this movie's based on is hilarious. Fellini totally misses the point, it seems. Read the Arrowsmith translation of Petronius and watch something else."
5,MASTERPIECE OF THE GROTESQUE,"Phew! Fellini's wild imagination runs rampant here, with a nightmare journey through a series of brothels with fat prostitutes, dwarfs, midgets, a truly sickening Roman feast/orgy with stuffed pigs, a priestess who belches fire from an uncomfortable part of the anatomy, a sinister visit to the lair of the minotaur and a deeply disturbing encounter with a hermit hermaphrodite. It's really too much to digest in one sitting, so I recommend viewing the movie over two days. Not for sensitive souls, but it's certainly a masterpiece of the grotesque. The only other movie that comes close is Burrough'sNaked Lunch."
5,Oh so good!,"It's amazing to think that the original story behind this movie was created at about the same time as the beginnings of Christianity. I watch this video once each year on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. It's a great antidote to the insanity of the Christmas season as ""celebrated"" in the U.S. of A. Highly recommended!"
3,Bygones,"There is a gentleman here hoping for a better print of Satyricon. Sadly, the best print was when The Criterion Collection released it on laserdisc. I have not seen it anywhere for sale and I lost the VHS copy I made from the CAV many years ago. I sold all my laserdiscs 15 years ago. Had I known what one-of-a-kind things they were I would have saved them."
3,Gorgeous but empty,"Satyricon was written during the reign of Nero. A sarcastic, bawdy novel about decadence and extravagance in Rome, it semed like an ideal vehicle for Fellini. Unfortunately, Fellini made a visually amazing film that left out the humor of the novel. We are left with a cool and detached look at pagan Rome that never quite takes off. Scenes go on too long with little purpose. Theatricality takes precedence over spontaniety and vitality. The film doesn't seem to have a center - none of the characters really matter. What we have is a series of picture postcards - a sort of diorama - of ancient Rome. Even for someone who loves ancient history, such as myself, this was difficult to sit through. Final score: visuals: 100, narrative: 60."
1,see it once,"but never again. My thoughts as I watched this film were: so this is what they did with rejected star trek sets, thank god they only translated every third line, I am not looking forward to the day it reaches DVD and we find out what was edited (or was it), and if given the choice between watching this film again or death - I would seriously consider death!"
5,Amazing Classic,"If you are a fan of film, and haven't seen this (most people haven't), then GET IT! I enjoy this much more than 8 1/2. Simply astounding that Fellini was able to have this produced. The scale is ENORMOUS. Only Peter Greenaway gets away with anything this elaborate anymore."
5,Bizarre work of genius,"There is nothing like Satyricon that I've ever seen (ok, except maybe The Serpent's Egg, which is very shocking and disturbing). Visually orgiastic, pagan, sadistic, earnest, creepy, and disgusting; but also featuring some of the most beautiful actors ever to stand in front of a lens.To me, this is by far the most interesting and arresting of Fellini's films."
1,Very abstract,"I could not get ""into"" the movie. I've heard of this director before and I find it had to believe that his work is any good BASED ON THIS MOVIE. Definately not my kind of movie. Very abstract and unappealing."
3,Typcal Felini,"staged and filmed more like a theatre production this Felini film set in one of Rome's darkest eras is based on two friends fighting over their same sex lust and love gains?? stick with and you'll either get it or not? The reality here is that this period of Rome was expressively promiscuous, dangerous and unforgiving."
5,My fav,Beautiful piece of art and I love it. Portrays my Eclipse beautifully!! Wish I could get one in other colors or more personalized.
3,Not enough photos,"Was expecting more photos of San Diego in the 50's, instead, there were many interviews of people talking about how everyone could walk through the streets at night and knew their neighbors. Was sadly disappointed overall."
2,Tortured hero and heroine,"This is a stand alone fantasy. How refreshing- no commitment to real 4-5 volumes to get the conclusion.Aiden our hero was imprisoned and tortured for nearly half of his life by his cousin the king.Lara our heroine was badly burnt in her attempt to be a female dragon rider.How these two tortured characters over come evil cones with many twists and turns that I did not see coming.Of course these two lonely souls fall in love.But....The ending left me angry and felt like a total let down for these two likable characters.2 starsCarol Berg has a better series that I highly recommend:The Spirit Lens: A Novel of the Collegia MagicaThe Soul Mirror: A Novel of the Collegia MagicaUnless you are a big Dragon fan, I would skip this book."
3,Not sure.,"I instantly liked the first book of her other series, and I did not have the same experience with this one. I was not surprised to read that this was her first book, because it had the feeling of having the same issues as the Seyonne novels being worked through-- long imprisonment, the effect of torture on the psyche, hidden talents. While interesting in places, it felt unformed in others.This said, Berg is still a formidable writer who managed to hold my interest throughout the book. I probably would have rated it more highly if I hadn't been comparing it to her other works.If you are new to Berg, then I would begin with Transformation. Established fans will most likely enjoy the ride."
4,Can't put it down.,"Once again, as with her previous novels, Carol Berg has written a novel that has kept me past my bedtime. When you start reading it's difficult to put down.This book has similar elements to book 1 of the books of the Rai Kirah. It tells the story of Aidan, his betrayal by his cousin and his revelation about this betrayal. Using first person narration, she draws you into the world of her characters, seeing what they see, thinking what they think, and doing what they do. It's very effective in immersing you into the book."
3,odd book,"I have to say that I agree with the other reviewer, this book does concentrate more on the trial than the character Lupe. This book was overall confusing and did not concentrate much on the plot, it was a fairly boring book but I read it because it was unique, and it is unique. If you are into demons than this is the book for you, it hold aspects that other books fail to leave out, on the other hand it does leave out a lot. The over all plot was predictable but unused so it was refreshing. The author leaves the reader with a sense of dread at books end.All in all I am confused about this book,as you can tell from my reviews. If you are trying to decide whether to read it or not I would suggest trying it, it could never hurt, but try a library first instead of buying it."
2,TYPICAL B-MOVIE,"Ok, as much as I hate to say it, this film is nothing special. I think Rutger Hauer is a phenomenal actor, but the movies he's been in over the past five years really stink. The film is bearable but don't expect too much. Special effects are minimal and the filming of flight scenes are not very convincing - poor version of Top Gun. If you are a Rutger Hauer fan stick to movies such as the Hitcher, Wanted Dead or Alive(VHS format only), and Blade Runner."
1,but the cat came back....,"That old kids song is a masterpiece of clever plotting, witty situations and all other things that make good story, compared to that movie.I am sorry I even watched it. I always was a big Rutger Hauer fan and it hurts to see him doing smth that awful.I wouldn't even give it a lonely star, only they do not have a ""below zero"" side to that scale."
2,ok for a normal night,"absolutely nothing special, and non convincing at some moments. I cannot understand how could only one person be able to drive an old Russian tank and fire its gun at the same time."
5,My description is not the book,"I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about Zen, and to students of ZenIt is a surprising book"
5,I LIKE YOUR WORK SO MUCH I WANT TO EDIT AND PUBLISH IN GREEC,MY NAME IS ALEXIA PETROPOULOY AND I REPRESENT AELLA EDITIONS IN ATHENS GREECE. I WOULD LIKE TO EDIT YOUR BOOKS TAO SPEAKS & ZEN SPEAKS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT I CANNOT FIND YOUR FAX OR TELEPHONE. PLEASE GET IN TOUCH WITH US BY CALL OR FAXING IN THIS NUMBER 0030 1 3255057.

2,"Maybe it is an acquired taste, like scotch","I read some online reviews of Ashley's music and was intrigued. Ordered a couple of cds. After listening to this one through twice, mostly what I hear is anger. It may be justified since I know nothing of his personal life but I don't care to listen to it."
4,Pretty good,"Ok first off, I've only heard a couple of Ashley's other songs. I'm new to him. I love Celtic music and just found out about him. The Celtic songs I've heard are great. I decided to get this since it's a rock album. It has it's good and bad points. His vocals aren't great, but they seem very emotional to me and I like that. There is a very good range of music styles from punk to rock to blues to country witch I also like. The songs that jump out at me are ""Bitch"" and ""Because I love you"" especially the latter. They are just so emotional to me and I can totally identify with them. The part I can live without is the gay crap, but hey each to his own. With all that being said. I do prefer the great fiddle player he seems to be."
2,May not be worth it... buyer beware!,"This is not a book that teaches techniques, principles, etc. It is merely a book which brings the vast experiences of the various teacher/mentors/friends, who have helped/taught the author in Martial Arts.Also the chapters are not well structured, i.e. each chapter is a story/anecdote of the mentor(s). This would have been better if the principles of that particular MA or mediation, etc, been discussed in conjuction. This is as the audience would not know what particular lesson is this chapter refering to.For a better read, i suggest, B K Frantzis, ""The Power of Internal Martial Arts: Combat Secrets of Hsing Yi, BaGua and Taiji."""
5,Wishing These Were Available,"I have owned these towels. When they were available. I wish Amazon still had them for sale. I'm a machine embroiderer, and do Day of the Week machine embroidery designs on them which I sell or give as gifts. I have found a few sets on other websites. But they are very expensive. Probably because they are so difficult to find."
1,Too many errors to be of any use,"The book is ovepriced, and with such a high percentage of errors. If the book is used as the sole study guide to pass the certification exam, then there is no way that the exam can be passed. I have attempted to get the Publishers to refund the cost of the book, but as yet (6 months) later there has been no response other thtan they will pass the query to the author. The author now has a VB5 version for the same outrageous $99.99 price. I will not waste my money on this as I do not expect any improvement in the contents."
5,Item as described.,Picture showed exactly what I needed to know to order for my label machine making it easy for me to purchase the right one. Fast shipping.
5,Great price,"Just like I've purchased in office supply stores for years, but a great price. I've been using the tape for several days and works perfectly. Recommend to anyone."
5,Tape so fantastic they shoud invent a new name for it.,"This tape is fantastic! I love it! It comes packaged in 100% cellophane AND bubblepack. Wow, are the folks at Brother thourough or what! Two actual layers of protection between you and the UPS guy!But the best part about this tape--it has adhesive on the back! And it's not the type you have to lick--it acually sticks by itself! Wow, how did they figure that one out? Although, personally, I prefer the lickable type. but, hey, what do I know?"
4,Brother Labeling good as always,"I am quite pleased with the TZ231 1/2"" Tape. I prefer the 1/2 over the 3/8"" tape because it is easier to read as folder labels."
5,Excellent product,I bought the label machine over a year ago and these labelling tapes are excellent. I have a retail store and use them to label all the items advertised for sale.
5,Bargain on TZ tapes,"In retail stores, Tz tapes are quite costly. Amazon had the best deals so far. Better yet,I also qualified for free S&H!"
1,Horrible Tape,"This tape is OLD and it doesn't work well. It will not print on certain sections of the tape, leaving blank spots. I couldn't use it at all. I had to go out and buy new tape at the local office supply store."
4,good seller,THE EXACT PRODUCT I ORDERED ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. WOULD PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.
5,"Save a lot, order online",This stuff is so expensive in office supply stores! You save a ton ordering online and there's no difference in quality.Just make sure you have the write cartridge type for your label maker and you won't have problems. As others have mentioned you can reduce wasted tape if you print several labels at once. Most label makers need to leave a large bit of slack label each time you start and end printing. If you print multiples and cut them by hand with scissors you can really save on that lost filler tape.
4,Great product,"The Brother Labeler is a great tool around the house. I use it to label my files, tools, kids items, and many other things. The black on white tape is perfect for any job."
4,Good labeling tape,The labeling tape works very well. My only complaint is that peeling off the back of the label is difficult because sometimes that back covering tears or does not come up easily.
4,Just what I wanted,"This was exactly what I was looking for. The tape came packaged in original manufacturer's packaging. Only complaint is the amount of ""dead space"" on both ends of the label, but this may be due to the printer I am using."
5,It's a tape cartridge,Fast shipping.It is a standard label tape cartridge. It does what it is supposed to do. Not much else one can say...
5,a third of the cost from the manufacturer,"Best price I found. As good as original. I don't usually look a Amazon.com, but I will from now on. Jimbo"
4,Good Price - Kinda Slow Shipping,"Long time user of Brother Labeler & only beef is the price of the replacement cartridges. This was a good price, but kinda slow shipping. Otherwise ok."
4,Used as extra backup for insights,"This was very helpful when I was teaching a ""History of Rock and Roll"" class because the text the school chose (and another they gave me) both started with too little information for the time prior to the 1950's and the book filled in (as most jazz texts would). I was glad I had this to give students a deeper, earlier foundation, which I think they didn't expect, but I transitioned over to be more be rock-centered after about the third week, and it worked. The book is not jazz focused after swing arrives, but it does a good job weaving the whole early picture together - you just need to get a history of jazz to have depth about all the later styles of jazz. I got the CD's included in the cover, and found one glitch so far...no Benny Goodman track even though the text offers a ""listening guide"" to him, but the same song is on YouTube anyway."
4,"Love the vibrant blue color and the lamination, but not available in 1/2 inch wide or narrower","Blue is one of my favorite colors too, and I do like how the print is laminated after printing the label out. What's good about the 3/4 inch wide is that I can print a larger text (up to 42 pts) or up to 5 lines of text.However, this is not available in 1/2 inch or narrower, and my current Brother handheld labeler (PT-1090) can accept tapes up to 1/2 inch wide. If I were to buy any Brother labeler that can accept 3/4 inch wide tapes, that will be like a desktop labeler, which is heavier and bulkier and also more expensive ($40+).So Brother, can you please, please, please manufacture this in 1/2 wide or narrower. I will appreciate that.:)"
2,Lousy,"Why even bother? Put in some effort next time. Anyone who shells out (current price) for Spooky Tooth knows a thing or two about what is already in circulation. Don't waste you money or time with this. Even the art, liner notes are pathetic."
4,Nice work,"I had never heard of Quantz until I caught his flute concerto in G on the radio. I don't usually get excited about flute concerti, but the pizzicato always does me in, and this piece has a nice passage."
1,Great Concept - Horribly Executed,"This a great concept of a book, but the scholarship, prose, and editing are all shoddy. Some facts are flat-out wrong, dates often have transposed numbers, entries are repetitive.Some of the entries are misrepresentative of censorship trends. For example, there is an entry on Voltaire's ""Candide."" However, the only time ""Candide"" was ever censored (as far as my research can tell) is once in the 1930s when one shipment of French copies was stopped in American customs because of the pictures. So it's the *artwork* which was being censored, not the novel. Additionally, much of Voltaire's work WAS actively censored, both during and after his lifetime, but Karolides and crew fail to mention that.My college Censorship Honors Seminar course used this book as a textbook and we spent most of our time wondering if the editor was asleep while proofing the text. It was horrid."
4,Past books banded because of ignorence.,"These books where banded from society because of human ignorence. I find by reading these wonderful clasics and by reading, and finding out why these stories where band will bring a new enlightenment to todays society."
5,Moving and beautiful CD,"I was lucky enough to sing in the St. James Cathedral Choir the year we recorded this CD. While they were often demanding recording sessions, the music is still some that I've never heard done better. The Biebl ""Ave Maria"" (track 11), with Howard's tenor solo can still move me to tears with it's soul-wrenching beauty, and the Bruckner ""Agnus Dei"" (track 8) is divine (just to name my favorites). While the choir has an amazing blend, it did not end up a homogeniged sound like many other large choirs. The listener really gets to hear the minute details of the music and dynamics that make this music a spiritual epihany."
4,label,this is a good label. sticks well and stays on. only thing is its hard to peel the back of the tape
2,Neither Horenstein nor Mahler in the best light,"With a seismic crack on the very first note of the tenor horn solo, some badly garbled playing and insensitively rushed tempi, and murkier sound in this ""official"" release of a bootleg recording than the Music & Arts ""unofficial"" release of some years back, this one is strictly for Horenstein (and Mahler) completists who are willing to overlook a lot for the sake of an allegedly ""legendary"" live performance. Both the conductor's memory and the composer's music deserve more. For a showcase of what Horenstein could achieve in concert, check out his pairing of the Bruckner Eighth and Ninth Symphonies in this BBC series, from roughly the same time period (1969) as this comparatively dismal effort. As for the Mahler Seventh, it's better served by Bernstein, Inbal, Abbado and, especially, Gielen."
3,VERY CUTE BUT CAME APART AFTER WASHING,"MY DAUGHTER WAS SO CUTE IN THIS COSTUME. HOWEVER, HANDWASHED IT BEFORE LETTING HER WEAR IT AND THE POODLE CAME OFF THE SKIRT. HAD TO PUT IT BACK ON."
2,Rubber came off pretty quickly,The rubber came off pretty quickly (just like for the original release platform this one replaced). I can't recommend this.
4,A classic video game succesfully made into an anime!,"The middle portion of this series starts it getting interesting. Ryu starts learning the secrets of the Hado, and M. Bison is finally introduced into the picture. The episodes start flowing together much more as this series continues. I've liked Street fighter and watched all the incarnations of it being ported to video and this is my favorite one. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the series tends to recycle the animation, using the same 3 punches over and over to represent the fights, and the fact that they used a lot of build up during the episodes and wasted a lot of time. I believe they were just trying to fill the half hour. But the story is solid and entertaining. Buy it if you like Street Fighter."
4,Getting better,I'm still quite surprised at how good this series is. Most shows and movies based on video-games are dreadful but SF II V seems to keep coming up with good stories and features great fight scenes. Even for animation the brawling still packs a punch and the cartoonish nature of the show never imposes on the more serious parts. By this point the story arc is becoming more sophisticated and ends up being rather theatrical. It's great the way they incorporate all the famous SF characters and still manage to give them quality writing.The DVD has a glitch though. From about the 3rd episode on the English dialogue is roughly 1-second off sync with the mouth movements. I got used to it but it still bugged me to begin with.
5,heavy but worth it,i never have to buy new battery every month any more and this thing lasts for weeks on end. its amazing.
5,violin casanova,"This is the first review I've written. I don't usually like to rate classical musicians, but after hearing this cd, I'm in love. I heard Mr. Chan play with the Met orchestra (he's the newly appointed concertmaster, at age 28..wow) and was moved by his performance. The Paganini on this disc is my favorite. Crystal clear virtuoso passages and warm and lyrical melodies. The Tchaikovsky Melody ebbs and flows, Ysaye with its tumultuous pyrotechnics executed flawlessly, with bravura. Such sensitive playing...the composers must be smiling in their graves."
5,King of Hearts,I originally saw this movie at a film festival back in the 80's. I was so happy to find it in DVD form. This movie really touched me both emotionally and philosophically. There is much symbolism in this so I wouldn't recommend for people who don't like that type of thing. It is also subtitled for only about half the movie. Most of this movie is a visual and thinking movie. It is uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time and has that foreign humor. If this is what you like I highly recommend this movie. It is a classic.
5,Delightful Classic with Serious Message,"""King of Hearts"" is full of whimsy and fantasy. But beneath the endearing facade is a very serious antiwar message. There is no question as to who the madmen are. The entire cast of ecccentric characters and the production hold up well after 40 years. It's easy to see why this movie made Alan Bates an instant star."
2,King of Hearts DVD,"Movie itself is great. It was sent as a gift to friend in London who couldn't view it. Did I miss the zone information? and it came with no cover, only a sleeve. all in all the first unsuccessful purchase. alas"
4,Nice film,"I like watching it w/ subtitles to try to learn better French. Also good story line and plot. It's meant to make you think about what it really means to be ""mad"" or ""crazy""."
5,best movie ever,"Anyone who went to Syracuse University in the late sixties or seventies knows that this was the most popular movie on campus year after year. I have watched it 17 times. It is an anti-war love story/comedy that generates a very warm feeling within its fans. However, people seldom recognize how important the music is in setting the mood changes from somber soldier scenes to carefree asylum-inmate scenes. The version with dubbed-in English is sometimes a bit difficult to understand, but the tidbits of wisdom in the words of the inmates are priceless. I have a copy I made from television years ago. I saw the English sub-titled version once and thought it made for a plain, ordinary movie because the magic of the inmates words was gone. Amazon.com should make it available in the English-dubbed version--if they do, I will buy it immediately."
4,"Daffy but daft sociological fable, mildly dated","Like the novels of Hermann Hesse and Ayn Rand, my love of this drily funny little movie belongs to the pre-ironic, not-yet-cynical splendor of my early 20s... That said, for all its simplicity, idealism, and panting 1960s enthusiastic vim, TKOH's clear-cut social dichotomy -- e.g., separating the mad from the mad -- never fails to lift the otherwise toothgrindingly lonesome human spirit. Actually, that all sounds too serious -- the movie's incredibly (though Gallicly) funny, and makes a fine double-feature with Marat/Sade."
5,Excellent,"One of the greatest, watchable, anti-war movies ever made. Thought provoking, charming, and very entertaining."
5,a comedy in reality,"I viewed this movie twenty five years ago and still remember parts of it quite well. As another person said to me,"" This just underlines what I have always thought. A person doesn't have to be crazy to survive on this earth, but it helps."""
3,This was once my favorite deck.,"Unfortunately, that was back when I had basically given up trying to understand the traditional tarot, and this system came along. The PoMo deck almost isn't tarot in the traditional sense -- a lot of the original symbolism is removed for more faithful reproduction of the artwork Williams wants to feature.It's an excellent introduction to PostModern art and art criticsm, and a way to see that there are many different ways of interpreting the tarot. I found that once I was able to learn more traditional tarot through the ""keyword"" system, though, PoMo made almost no sense at all -- it's its own little universe.The cards, btw, are both huge and flimsy: not the best combination. However, I like the art style and plan to keep my deck for its own sake."
5,AWESOME,"Very quick shipment, perfect communication and perfect packaging [and my toy travelled over the Athlantic [I only found this on the UE]]. It's one of the greatest toys I've ever had, [and I'm 19, lol]. I put 4/5 stars on educational value because I think it's perfect for kids, teenagers, and all kind of people [over 8 or 9, the pieces are too small]. I think kids could improve their profundity and creative skill with this toy.I'm enjoying this toy! :)"
2,stick with lego,"These blocks are small and hard to handle. Each is the size of the smallest lego (the lego piece with one dot). It is difficult to connect them to each other. You have to line up the ridge on one side of a block with a corresponding channel on the next block. And, they don't stay stuck together.If you care to painstakingly assemble a model of something, you may like this. But there is not the spontaneity you'd have with Legos because they just don't go together easily.Pros: bright colors.Cons: everything else."
2,"Kind of cute, but...","Maybe it's just me, but I hate when an author uses the same phrase over and over in a book. If I had to read about Ben's ""Green Gaze"" one more time I was going to throw this book out the window!! It's a small complaint, other than that this was a fun, fast read and I enjoyed it."
1,S-Video Cable Review,"I only had to wait 2 weeks on it. The only bad things about the product is it only works on newer model Televisions...other than that, it's a good product. Nearly doubles the graphic looks of a game and it's resolution clarity."
5,Hydro Thunder Necessity?,"I bought this adapter for better picture quality, and found a side benefit. Hydro Thunder, in multiplayer mode, gets very dark, necessitating turning the brightness and/or contrast up much too high. With the S-Video adapter, it stayed playable at movie-watching levels of brightness and contrast, even in multiplayer."
2,2.5 Stars,"Boo Yaa Tribe is some of the best west coast music in awhile, but is not really that good. Best track on the album hands down is Heated, featuring Short Khop (OH MY GOD!!!) he kills that song, but still NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Timely Topic,"This book had an interesting way of examining the topic of one woman's experience with breast cancer. I like the way the author based the book around the main character's love and devotion to her family. However, It would have been nice to have some input from the family and how this impacted them. At times the sentences were choppy and difficult to follow. Some of the chapters were confusing as to if we were in the present or if the main character was in the past? Overall it was an interesting book with a popular topic. I look forward to this author's next work....Reviewed by LadyCD"
5,Rhythm Song,"One of my favorite CD's. Each selection is interesting and musically beautiful. Perhaps the selection I listen to the most is ""A Little Prayer."" The simplicity of the melodic line creates a wonderful sense of peace. ""Robbin' Harry"" is just plain fun. I have owned this CD for several years and have purchased more for gifts. I enjoy the musicality of each selection and appreciate the musicianship of Ms. Glennie."
5,buy it for yourself...and your kids,"This was the first of Berke Breathed children's books that we purchased (we now have them all). All of his children's books are wonderful- filled with the whimsical characters we love, and uplifting messages as well.As new parents (and not the sort to register for gifts) we recieved 5 or 6 copies of Goodnight Moon. For anyone who has read that book a million times, this one is welcome relief. That said, I bought the book for us, but, our kids love it too (as well as his other kids' books- the last basselope in particular)."
5,22 and over 300 times,"You might say that im a little too old for this book, but hey age is just a number. My obession with this Opus began in 1995 when my little sister brought home to me ""Good night Opus"" Before that i had a couple stuffed character Opus. She didn't care for the book but she knew I liked him. It is a real good book to read when you are down or just want to depart from the text. I love Opus and it was a real shame to see Berkley Breathed go so soon. I'll miss his style"
5,Buy this book!,This is one of my all time favorite children's books. The story is hilarious...The illustrations are incredible. It insights imagination and laughter like no other picture book I know. Buy this book. You'll be glad you did!
5,Love It,I love reading this book to my kids it has fantastic illustrations and is a very clever story. My 6 year old son loves it and I recommend it for children aged 5-8+. It is one of the best childrens books I have had the pleasure of reading.
4,"Interesting book, clearly spoofing Goodnight Moon","Opus is listening to the same (boring) story he's heard zillions of times before when he departs from the text, in quite a spectacular way - flying through the milky way, going diving with Abe Lincoln's statue, nearly crashing into an airplane...!It does go on and on for a while. Not for kiddos with short attention spans."
5,All his children's books are great.,Excellent BIG picture books all with a wonderful message. I am as big of a fan as my kids are.
2,Canon Remote Switch,"Unlike the less expensive wireless switch for the Rebel, this has a very short cord. For the money, it's not very impresive."
2,Does the job but very poor built.,"It works; does the job. It looks good. However, it looks so fragile that I can't keep it out of plastic bubble wrapping. I feel like it's gonna fail me on the field one day or another--scary. Super expensive considering it's very cheap plastic-made and only contain a wire and a push-pull button. I wanted to build one myself but of course Canon used a special plug/socket that I couldn't find on the market. If you can find a third party one, go for it!"
1,Another overpriced Canon accessory.,You can get a near equal quality one for around five bucks (including shipping) on sites like meritline.
4,Too expensive,Too expensive but it does what I need besides I got a $50 gift card for filling out a survey so my net cost was $7.45 cheap!!
1,lousy and slow service,I paid extra for Air Next Day service. Item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately. Item eventually arrived two weeks later. I had left for a trip. Item was eventually sent back to merchant. Merchant didn't credit me for item returned. I had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited. I won't buy from Willoughby's again.
4,Works like it should,"After struggling with a cheapo ebay (a new ""buy it now"") purchase, I got frustrated enough to pay the extra for the actual item. It works well, and every time. It was the right decision."
4,Well its a dumb wire with a switch sure it works...,But for the life of me I cant understand why this thing costs 50$ its an outrage. I use it a lot and it works great but the price is just ridiculous.The one comment is that the disconnect is not so user friendly and at night when you most times need the remote its hard to disconnect.The biggest issue is still the price......
4,Useful addition for my Kit,"Useful while taking photos using ""Mirror Lock up"" on a Tripod.The construction quality is good. The switch also has a lock feature useful for ""Bulb exposures"".What i did not like is that the switch plug fits only one way. This will prove tricky when you try to fit it when its dark. Be sure to practice this."
2,Cheap quality crap.,The packaging for this Canon product is such a joke. I actually had to look at the packaging to ensure it came from Japan. This overpriced super basic remote switch does its job but other remote switches can do the same for much less. Why did I buy it? My wife is a sucker for the 'Canon' brand I couldn't talk her out of it.
5,Canon Remote Cable Release,"It was suggested I purchase a remote switch to ensure crisper photos............I NEVER would have thought a little piece of plastic would make such a difference.....INCREDIBLY it has...........and my thanks to Canon for making an 'idiot proof' product...........SO easy to use there were no instructions; as they say, plug and play..........I am thrilled"
2,Now HERE's how to make money!,"...Build a great camera like the EOS1, the 5D, or 20D that I own. Sell it at a competitive price. Then, sell accessories for it and sell them at a 1000% markup. Be sure to patent the product so that no third party can produce a less expensive version. Want an example? Try this Remote Switch for instance.Here's how it works. You connect it to the camera. Press the button half-way, you get focus, exposure metering, etc. Press the rest of the way, you have a photo. Pretty simple stuff.Functional? Yes. Practical? definitely- a must have in fact for tripod users. Worth $50? No way. This product gets 2 stars from me because I'm insulted that I had to pay so much for it given its value.Want more examples? Try a Canon lens hood for $50 or a rechargeable battery for the same amount. (Hint: Look around, you'll find non-Canon batteries for 1/3 the price with higher capacity -- they didn't get us on that one!)"
3,Fine but pricy,"I already own the RS-60E3 remote switch and I had to buy this new one for my 20d. A shame they keep changing the connectors to have you the new one. However, it does work fine and gets the job done."
4,So far so good.,"My earlier shutter release (one of the cheaper versions) lasted no more than a year before the rubber cracked and wore away where the cable meets the switch, and the plug became loose.This time I have paid the extra for this model and so far it is performing well. The 80cm cable is the right length for my purposes,and the plug is a snug/ secure fit."
4,Essential for night photography,The title says it all. I use this for my 20D to shoot at night on a tripod. Kind of expensive for such a short cord but it does the job.
4,Because You Need It,"OK, no idea why the price is [...] for this. I plaid 25 for my Nikon MCDC2 remote that is excactly the same as this and I thought that was to much. The handle is a bit larger which I like, but dislike the ""flex"" in the plastic. also the cord is about 2 inches shorter than my Nikon remote.Besides that it does what it suppose to do and should last a while with normal use. Though would not say strong build, I don't think it will break to easily even though it is all plastic. I do recommend this product, as I think a remote is essential to any photo set-up, but c'mon they really should just include it with the camera. They pay what a buck, if, that to make it? Atleast drop the price to 10 or so for us, who already paid out a fortune for your camera."
5,Canon RS-80N3 Remote Switch,"This is my second purchase of this product. The first was ruined by sand at the beach after having worked without problem for years. Have had no problem otherwise, it works just fine and I would not consider taking a macro photograph without it. While I was waiting for delivery I had to use the time delay on my camera and boy is that a waste of time. With this you hit the button and your picture is taken without shake. I wish the cord was a bit longer but it has not really been a problem."
4,Works fine,Another official accessory that could stand to be cheaper considering what it does. At least it works fine and will get you shake free images. Really could use a longer cord.
4,Good Quality,"The switch performs well. Several reviewers complain about the price but assuming Canon tests this item as thoroughly as they do their other products, I expect this item will give me years of trouble free service. China probably makes a cheaper version but there is no assurance that it will not crack or fail due to poor molding or cheaply made parts. I will pay the extra cost and have confidence in Canon's ability to develop, test and market quality products."
3,Hard to remove,"I have it for only a month. My other generic brand of remote switch gave up already on me. I hope this will last for a long time. But anyway, I got tiny fingers and still having a hard time removing this remote switch from the camera. It's either you use your two hands, or with one hand, squeeze it and push it up slow. Not a good idea if you are in a hurry. The lock mechanism is kinda complicated to men."
4,simple and easy to use,"i bought this because i tend to photograph physic models of buildings, i'm an architect, and with a tripod and this remote is all done.compare to an old model, the one i use with the eos500 model, the feature that you can rool the cord in the remote itself, was really cool for packing the whole equipment. but the remote was very much little too.in the end is good, can be better but that is a design issue of canon.i recommended"
1,Does not fit my new EOS 60D,"This specifically says it is for a Canon 60D camera, but the plug is not the same. The plug on my 60D is the same as a T2i, or a EOS rebel."
5,Works as advertised,It proved to be exactly as functional and precise as I'd hoped it would. Well worth it.
3,Prefer form factor of RS60-E3,"The RS-80N3 is much larger than the previous generation remote, the RS60-E3. Though it could be argued this is for a better fit in your hand, I still prefer the smaller size and fit and finish of the RS60-E3. The RS-80N3 takes too much room in your camera bag for no real difference in usability. I wish Canon would have kept the old form factor. Having said that, I still think the Canon remote is a better choice than the third party remotes."
4,Canon RS-80N3 Remote Switch,"Does exactly what it was designed to do, i.e., allows oneto trip the shutter while away from the camera. It is nota wireless device however."
2,Too Expensive to be so Cheap,"This is the second one of these I've owned, the first failed because the wiring separated from the top of the switch mechanism. It worked like that for a while but then started to intermittently not react to commands. So I bought another. In less than a year the rubber wire attachment at the top of the remote has opened up and exposed the copper wiring underneath. It still works fine, but I am waiting for it to start failing me. I don't like to have potential problems lurking in my camera bag so this really causes me anxiety. I'm thinking of buying the cheaper after-market one as a backup for when this does stop working.Bottom Line: the above review is the review I would expect to read for the cheap after-market version. Instead, the reviews are better for that one and it's less than $10!"
1,disappointed,I bought the Canon RS-80N3 last week for my Canon 60D. This remote is NOT compatible with the Canon 60D like it is says. Not recommended if you have this camera.
1,I've had over 400 orders from Amazon. This is the worst of them.,"Amazon service is an easy 5 out of 5. This product, however, is absolutely worthless. Of the 400+ items I bought from Amazon, this is the worst purchase ever. The plastic mold was too thick to allow the pins to connect to my 7d, so you would have to hold it against the connection on the 7d to use it (which defeats the purpose). Don't spend your money on this. I ended up getting a $7 third-party shutter that works flawlessly. Canon has great cameras, but seems to skimp on accessories."
4,Does what it is supposed to do....,"It does what it's supposed to do. Nothing more, nothing less. If it were a little cheaper, I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Way over priced.,"I love Canon, they make a terrific camera and some of the best lenses available. But, over $50 for this bit of plastic and wire? I have bought generic versions on EBay for about $15 shipped and they work great... No frills just a half shutter, full shutter, hold shutter slider button... much like this one. There is no denying that a remote switch is very useful especially when taking long exposures on a tripod or where even the button press could change the cameras orientation too much. But for $50 it should either be wireless or offer some sort of intervalometer feature. If you're the type who always buys Monster cables instead of generic, then maybe it's worth the premium to you. And even if you can't find a generic available, you can always use the timer feature of your camera as an alternative."
2,"Works, but...","Got this with my Dreamcast for christmas, It works fine, but the connector broke within weeks of owning it. It still works, but, the color quality has been lowered and it always falls out of the back of my TV."
2,InterAct RFU adapter,"Didn't really help my dreamcast, but it could have been the tv or tv converter box."
4,Primary documents from the Civil War era,"Cawthon's out-of-print volume introduces helpfully and comments on a series of letters saved by a never-married distant relative (the inevitable guest) who lived in South Carolina during the American Civil War. My particular interest in this book is the attention it gives to the life and correspondence of one of my ancestors, Captain Thomas Epaphroditus Howle, and his family. But the value of the book goes beyond genealogical interests as the letters reveal sociological concerns of mid-nineteenth century America."
3,The thinking person's bathroom book of humor and psychology,"Les Caracteres is one of the most often quoted works of French literature, and with reason. The book is more of an anthology of humor and wisdom than a continuous narrative, composed of one-sentence to two-page sketches, maxims, and reflections on everything from good and bad behavoir in the king's court to how to avoid becoming obsessed with bird-watching. Writing in the 16th century, La Bruyère's humor is surprisingly modern at times, all the while painting honest and vivid portraits of his period.Separated loosely into thematic chapters, the book can be picked up and put down at ease without breaking the thread--just the thing for the reader who, for one reason or another, finds herself frequently interrupted. Much like (but funnier than) the Analects of Confucious or the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, the Caractères are at once thought-provoking, historically enlightening, emanently readable, and entertaining."
1,A Stirring Experience,"After visiting six stores and searching the internet, I finally found a deep saucepan with an 8 1/2 inch diameter to handle the not very long arms of the StirChef. Attaching the StirChef to my new 4qt saucepan, I turned it on to stir some chopped vegetables for 10 minutes at low heat. After about 4 minutes the flimsy plastic blades began to melt, adding an interesting but unwanted taste to the vegetables. Well, at least I have a nice new saucepan."
1,Worse than useless.,I spent one dollar on this at a thrift shop and I still feel like I was ripped off. It is no surprise they are already out of business. The thing doesn't even fit on all but one of my saucepans. I feel sorry for impulse buyers that don't check out these reviews first.
5,strange,"I realize that they are out of business so this review doesn't really matter, but I just wanted to chime in. Someone gave me this as a gift (which I thought was stupid, frankly). I was pleasantly surprised. I've made Risotto, many cream sauces, custards. Had no problems with it. It did what it said it would do. I've had it for about 5 years. Maybe I was just lucky."
2,Doesn't fit King size bed!!,"I looked all over for jersey knit sheets for our new king size bed. I found them on amazon for a pretty good price so I purchased this set. After I washed them I attempted to put them on my bed and they did not fit. My mattress is a normal mattress and all other types of sheets have fit without a problem. These sheets were soft and pretty inexpensive, but beware, they probably won't fit your bed."
3,"Not bad, does the job","The cover works well and fits my 2 Gig second gen pretty good. I have to open the flip top to really reach the hold switch though. Over all it does what it is suppose to, protect my iPod. For the price you can't really complain. It works fine and the belt clip is a handy gadget. For an inexpensive solution to covering and protecting your iPod, I would recommend this product.Shipping was fast as well which was nice."
4,Leather flip case for my Nano 1G,"This is my first purchase to an independent seller through Amazon and I am very satisfied with my purchase. It was delivered as promised, I received email messages when it was being shipped and when I was going to receive it, and the item fits my old I-Pod."
5,Excellent case for both 2 GB and 4 GB!,"I bought 2, one for me and one for my wife. both the screen protector and the case fits our ipods perfetly. Got the protection it needed.I found no problem with these, get it before buying more expensive!"
2,cheesy and unbelievable,"Having just read Robert Monroe's 3 fantastic OBE books, I'm sorry to say that Soul Journeys is extremely sub-par in comparasin. I have a VERY hard time believing the authenticity of her other-worldly experiences. By chapter three she talks about visualizing writing a best seller and gives a long pitch about how we should encourage friends to buy her book (and not to lend ours). What really trips me up though are the very cheesy, obviously contrived dialogues she has with everyone, particularly Bob Monroe himself in spirit. There are a lot of well-worn, but mortal sounding new age truisms that lack any fresh persepective. Bottom line is she's a sub-par writer, the story is suspect and lacks credibility, and compared to Robert Monroe's stuff its just plain boring."
2,A LOT OF WORDS THAT DON'T SAY ENOUGH,"I was excited to recieve this Book when I ordered it. But I was Disappointed in it's Content. The Author Rambles a lot about her Animals (I love animals too) especially her Cats & her Deceased & Living Relatives & Farm. None of which is interesting enough to write about. There is some information in her Book that is Good. But, nothing that I haven't read before. The Same info in this Book has been written by Sylvia Browne & others with more Detail, more Focus & Better, Clearer Writing Skills, that don't go off rambling about un-important things. I'd Skip this one."
2,Much Needed Serenity For Those In Their Seventies....,"Rosalind McKnight was 70 years old when she wrote this book. She also had heart problems, obvious concerns about her future finances, and a failed marriage she wishes had not ended. Yet all her dialogues of the ""other side"" are bright and sunny and hopeful. If she was a devout Christian, one could imagine her writing a NDE book on the glories of Heaven. Some will find this book inspiring, while others will find it insipid. For me, I'm afraid, it was the latter."
4,Excellent book for learning astrology,This is an excellent book for learning astrology. I had no idea that this was the way to read an horoscope. Great book!
4,"Counseling Straight Up, with Twist of Astrology","As a reader, I often find that I am not so much using my knowledge of astrology and tarot in the reading, as just counseling people. I don't think I would be exxagerating to state that well over 75% of the people I read for just want to unload and get some type of counseling. I found this book to be helpful in gaining more skills and knowledge in these areas. Granted, it didn't seem to teach me anything new in astrology, but I do feel I gained a wealth 0f knowledge when I look at how it has helped me look for key signs and know how to react in certain situations during readings."
3,Power and Punch,"I've had this rifle for about two (2) months and I really enjoy it. Lots of ammo room and a light trigger. Comes with scope and flashlight which adds to futureworld appearance, but little else.Negative side; I put up a paper target about 20-25 feet away and fired away. The BB's all nicely hit the target and then fell to the ground. Also, make sure the battery is well charged, because performance drops as the battery level does.Other than that, a nice gun for the begineer before going on to something with more Power and Punch; Spring or Gas. Unless your'e righ stick with Springers."
5,"Happy, heartfelt songs","Clever lyrics in songs about the coming birth of a baby that are filled with humor and caring. Brian Joseph scores again with his voice, his music and his humanism. This is a charming set of songs."
2,"Good, but coating is not flexible enough",I bought this strap in late August to use with an iPhone case. With steady wear the plastic coating of the wire has recently split in one section. And I suddenly have a rash on my neck which I am guessing is from exposure to the base metals used in the actual wire. I will have to find a better option.
3,Okay strap,"I brought this to carry camera and phone. The length of this strap is designed for camera and strap around your neck. I was gonna use it with phone but it was too long. Otherwise, this is a good camera strap. Well built."
3,OK but Not Great,This is an OK product and I thought it was going to be much longer so that the camera could have been held in many more angles without straining or taking it off my neck. It is more comfortable than simple string type neck straps and much sturdier. I use it for work and this is clearly meant for casual use or vacations. Not too bad if you're not expecting much more than a glorified strap.
5,Best one for Canon Point and Shoots,"I have this in my bag for my Canon SX200IS. Very strong and looks very nice.I used it at my daughter wedding reception, since I knew I would be busy shaking hands. Looks great with a suit and tie! I use the wrist strap most of the time, but this is a very nice strap when you need both hands free. I went to a camera store, and it was priced a full retail, $16.00! AMAZON comes through again! Great bargain."
3,Getting stiffed.,"Don't misunderstand, this neck strap was received in good condition and is nicely made. The problem is that it is far too stiff. The original design was smaller in diameter and felt very supple. This one is like a small cable. It works, but is far too spartan in feel."
4,"Attractive, but not terribly flexible","The neck strap is very attractive, but the plastic coating over the metal makes the strap less flexible, hence it's more challenging to quickly stuff it into a small digital camera case."
3,Canon metal neck strap,"I tried to use the strap and found it to be a bit uncomfortable/annoying. If I really had to be hands free I would use it, but the camera fits very well into a pocket."
3,Sturdy construction,"I have an Cannon Elph, mostly I use it for field exercise pictures because of its solid construction. I have opted for just using 550 cord as a lanyard."
2,Cuts neck a bit...,"I bought this for my wife, who was concerned about having a more secure strap. It is secure there is no doubt about that, but it cuts into the back of you neck a bit. During the winter it is not an issue, because you wear a coat, but during the warmer months we do not use it."
1,UNCOMFORTABLE!!,"I rarely review products unless I have a strong opinion, which in this case I do. I own a very small digital camera, (Canon sx210IS)and used this strap for a day at our state fair. I found the metal to be very uncomfortable as did my friend that I asked to put around her neck to give me a break!! If you are looking for comfortable, this is not for you."
2,PLASTIC and metal,"The description for this item doesn't mention that this chain has a metal core and a PLASTIC or vinyl coating. I expected a classier ""jewelry-like"" chain, but with the plastic coating you might as well get any old nylon neck strap. What's the point of having a metal one if it looks and feels so cheap? Plus, the plastic makes it a bit stiff so it doesn't hang as naturally as it would otherwise. This is being returned."
1,This is for return,"I thought I was getting a nice sleek item for holding on to my new camera. The metal strap has some kind of plastic coating, and it is a lot bulkier (not sleek) than I thought. I'll keep looking because this was NOT it!"
2,Not necessary.,"I bought this neck strap WITH my camera, thinking I would be insane not to have a strap to put around my neck.I learned, however, that it really isn't necessary. The Elphs are so tiny that they EASILY fit into your pocket. The other option is to wind the included wrist strap around your wrist. They're so lightweight that you barely notice they're there."
1,Best Of Sports Bloopers,NOT worth it. No commentary or narration. See better bloopers on TV news programs
1,Don't Be Duped -- READ THIS REVIEW!!,"Just received this tape today and feel duped. Even worse than this tape. The video quality was 4th generation-looking, the tracking was damaged over a considerable portion of the entire tape, and if that weren't enough -- it was compiled in Extended Play Mode!!!! There were probably a dozen very cool blooper scenes out of hundreds of mostly ho-hum, bordering on boring ones. The music bed underneath was extremely grating, especially since it did not develop for the 45 min. duration of the tape (the box says 50 min., but not true). I should return it, but it's just not worth the hassle. DO NOT, I REPEAT -- DO NOT -- BUY THIS TAPE. You will be sorry you did."
3,Matcha Tea,"Received my tea in a timely manner, the taste of the tea is just ok, but I'm sure there are great health benefits."
4,24mm impact socket,"the unit worked great the only time i used it.the tool looks well made, walls are ample and corners crisp."
5,Trident Cool Rush Gum,This is my favorite gum and I have to order via Amazon.Com because I can't find it on store shelves.
1,you're kidding,"You're telling me that the original price of a 12-package carton of Trident Cool Rush gum is $949.00? And you're selling it for less than $8.00? Get serious. You can buy a good used car for $949. This is about the falsest advertising I've ever seen. Trident Cool Rush is excellent gum, but it is not worth $949."
5,So Cute!,Emailed 1 Cute Pooch the info for my Dog Muttsie and had my custom Pet PL8 in just a few short days...and did I mention it is so Cute!
4,Good Light Read,"I feel this book was a good read for the simple fact that there aren't many books like it (for women). As an aspiring traveller, myself, this book was an easy-to-gobble-up book which provided a dose of inspiration and didn't strain my brain too much. I mean what do you expect from a published children's book author (Rita Golden Gelman).It was actually a breath of fresh air. I appreciate Gelman's sharing her experiences, which offer importance and relevance to any woman planning to travel to distant countries.For a good, light read, I recommend this book."
4,"A LITERARY GIANT - NO, BUT A GOOD READ NEVERTHELESS","I did enjoy this book. It was interesting. What it lacked innarrative style, is certainly made up for with enthusiasm and charm. I should think that this was a difficult book for the author to creat. I certainly would not like to go through the sort of self-examination, memory dredge she apparently subjected herself to. Ms Rita would be a wonderful person to just set and swap stories with. Hope we get more."
4,"Inspiration, no matter the gender","Appreciate author's candid portrayal of vulnerability, so I can imagine doing the things she has done;she isn't fearless--she walks through it. Reciprocity and zen nowness are just two valuable lessons contained in Rita's tales."
5,Rita is an Un-met Friend,Couldn't put this book down! Rita's flowing writing style - set in the present tense - makes you feel like you are right there with her. Her honesty and personal anecdotes and her ability to connect with people are encouraging and inspiring. What's next for Rita? and for me?
4,Take a mental vacation and get inspired!,"`Tales of a Female Nomad' is the fantastic true story about Rita, a middle aged woman from the US, traveling alone across the world. She shares and writes children's stories all the while experiencing the anthropological joy of living in different communities and cultures. Rita's inspiring tale spans at least a decade of travels beginning with Mexico and then jumping across the globe nearly haphazardly as friends and strangers alike invite her to new places and homes. I would love to follow in her footsteps. What an adventure!I read this book in spurts over the course of several months (between class assignments and such) and the division of chapters by location/time was well suited to casual reading of this sort - granted me a sort of mental vacation to another place and time with each sitting."
2,Interesting events written uninterestingly,"Although I honor Rita Golden Gelman for her intrepid spirit in traveling alone to exotic locales, and although I can relate to her background (I too grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut), I agree with the other reviewers who found her writing banal. I have not yet finished the book (after starting to read it one month ago), though I've tried mightily--because her style makes the most interesting events seem bland and boring. For her next outing, I would suggest Ms. Gelman acquire a ghost writer who is able to describe characters more imaginatively (all of the women in her book have ""shiny black hair"", and all of the men are ""around forty""!)and who can create a more vivid sense of place and purpose."
1,Simply unlikeable,"What sounded like a very interesting account of self-discovery ended up being the smug, irritating and self-serving diary of a completely unlikeable woman. I wanted to like her, wanted to be empathetic, yet by the end I was cheering her husband for getting away from her."
2,"Loved the title, disliked the book","I wanted to love this book. Unfortunately, Gelman has not learned the art of telling a story without giving her judgements on it. I wish she had given the reader some credit to be able to distinguish what characters are sincere and which ones aren't. Instead, she tells us her opinions of these people, leaving the reader no room for interpretation. I felt preached to. With every passing page, I felt more and more resentment toward her style of writing that proclaimed how her choices, her travel style and her friends were far superior to anyone else's.There are many other travel books that do a much better job of allowing the reader to feel a part of the story. Choose one with, perhaps not as good a title, but with better writing."
2,The Road Not Taken,"While Rita Gelman describes the countries she's visited and people she's met, her book is more of a travelogue than an insightful travel memoir. The writing is uninspired, particularly given the out-of-the-way places she visited and people she befriended. The roads she did take and places they led her had such potential to deliver fascinating insights into what she learned about herself in the process. But she chose not to take that road and rather gave us her travel diary: first I went here and met so-and-so and then I went there, etc."
4,Loved it! Makes me want to travel the unknown...,"What an inspiring adventure! Gelman writes very well and gives you an intimate view into interesting people, lives, cultures, and landscapes with such wisdom. I was along for the ride!"
2,exciting adventures poorly told,"A real disappointment. I admire the writer's chutzpah and ability to take what comes, and I can only imagine she has considerable personal charm to talk herself into the places and situations in which she found herself. What we see of her in the book is far from charming however. It is particularly aggravating that a professional writer who has evidently lived an extraordinary life can only speak about it in tired - VERY tired - cliches."
1,Blech - save your money,"I have to echo what others have said, as I want to save you from the way I feel about the money I spent on this book. The author has been to fascinating destinations for fifteen years, yet somehow managed to write a terrible book about them. Her constant ""taking"" from the people and places she visited were appalling. Teaching English is not enough of a contribution when you are a wealthy writer relying on the hospitality of others, particularly in the developing world. Help me out and please recommend other travelogues?"
1,A self-absorbed tale,"I just couldn't identify with Rita at all. Of course, I'm not independently wealthy; I care about my friends and family and the home and life I've made after 35 years of hard work. I have also traveled to many third world countries, and I find it presumptuous to insert my American worldviews into their culture as Rita does. She has an opportunity to discover and share so much of the people and cultures she encounters, but it seems that she just brings up her awful baggage of her own past self-centered existence. It seems that all she's invested in her new life traveling throughout the world is getting a degree in anthropology which suddenly gives her all the credentials she needs to become an expert in humanity. As I read through the book, I only see her as a naive, self-serving American, taking from the people she encounters and congratulating herself on a fine existence."
2,Interesting but not compelling,Enjoyable stories but too much detail. You feel like you are living with her side by side but relaying so much detail is a bit much. I skimmed through much of the book after the first couple of chapters.
1,"Poorly written, self-absorbed memoir","Another poorly written, self-indulgent, boomer memoir reminiscent of ""Eat, Pray, Love."" This author chooses to write only what she wants to share with no regard for the storyline, the interests of the reader or, most annoying, a shred of respect for the craft of writing in the English language. A very frustrating read, to say the least."
1,"Pretentious, yet whiny","I applaud Ms. Gelman for putting herself in the position to explore the world. But his needy, self-absorbed travelogue utterly lacked inspiration. I am astounded that a professional writer who has the audacity to criticize others work puts forth such pointless writing. Endless triviality does not equate to fulfilling experiences. I actually believe her stories are better than what are portrayed in this book, but as it stands I'm angry I spent the money."
2,Inspiring but annoying,"This book started with a great title and premise, but then goes downhill from there. As one who spends a significant amount of time daydreaming about ""leaving it all behind"", I was anxious to hear what promised to be an exciting account of her new life, but the book disappointed me.I enjoyed the first third of the book as she begins her life-changing experience, but found her personally annoying by the end. Perhaps my dislike of her is politically based, but I quickly grew tired of her self-righteous, understander of all peoples, angry at America attitude. Where initially I saw her as a courageous woman dealing with a dramatic life-changing event, by the end she came across as a somewhat bitter, nearly unstable expat. Please just more objective descriptions of your unique experiences and less left-leaning ranting. It was hard to finish.If you're not bothered by the politics of the author, this book does provide an interesting account of a variety of experiences."
5,Inspiring and Motivating,"Because of this book, I finally found the courage to live the lifestyle that I had only dreamed about. This book is what finally got me to leave my job that I was very unhappy with to move abroad. I got a job teaching overseas and had the most amazing adventures. It was the best decision I ever made. Before I left, I exchanged a couple of emails with the author and even had dinner with her when she came through my town on a book tour. She is a delightful woman - intelligent, funny and very 'normal' for someone with such an alternative lifestyle. She is a wonderful writer. I couldn't put the book down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with any interest in travel or living abroad - and even if you aren't this sort of person, it might just stir a little bit of wanderlust in you as well."
1,Terribly Written,"It was torture to get through this book, and I must admit I had to speed-read and skip several pages, even chapters, to reach the end. There are several great adventures here, but it's too bad the writing is so poor. Laurie Gough's ""Kite Strings of the Southern Cross"" is beautifully written, poetic, and obviously written by a gifted writer. Just because a traveler has gone out and seen the world, doesn't mean that traveler should/can write a book about it. Perhaps Rita Gelman should take some writing classes before embarking on further excursions."
1,"Interesting lifestyle, TERRIBLE writing style",The high reader review rating for this book completely baffles me. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it! It has about as much style and insight as a tween's diary entry. There are infinitely better titles out there in the woman-living-abroad genre...don't waste your time and money on this one.
2,Not worth the read,I found this book boring and poorly written. It was a waste of my money. Too bad.
1,Narcissistic,"This woman managed to make fascinating places seem boring. She is so wrapped-up in herself that she obscures the places she visits. A terrible book in which she often seems to do no more than chop, grind, pound, mash, grate, (add any number of other verbs, she does...) vegetables as she moves in and out of peoples' lives, unable to form intimate connections. Ionabicycle."
2,Interesting concept.... but dissappointing,"I was looking foward to delving into this book and learning about various cultures and this woman's spiritual journey. Unfortunately, I only made it through the first few chapters. The cultural experiences she spoke of were interesting but the tone of her book reflecting the high opinion that she has of herself. While it's conmendable and courageous to live as a nomad there was no need for her constant bragging throughout this book."
2,I wanted to love it .... but I didn't,"I love books about wanderlust. Eat, Pray, Love and Into the Wild to name some well known books. For a woman who wanted to leave her entitled life behind, she still managed to crave entitlement - in my opinion. She always negotiated food with her rent so she was served most of her meals rather than shopping and cooking for herself. She wanted to live with the locals where she went, but then she complained when she couldn't have things her way. I know some will not be so harsh as I'm being with their reviews, but she really rubbed me the wrong way. Lastly, who remembers James Frey's ""A Million Little Pieces""? I think this woman also embellished what actually happened. I'm not saying she didn't do all these things, I just think her memory is different than what actually happened. If all these things happened to me, I'd go out and buy a lottery ticket. I only made it half way through the book. I was getting irritated every time I picked it up."
2,Golden Retriever Handbook,I was disappointed in the contents of the book. I expected more details on how to handle puppy problems and more specifics on the Golden Retriever breed vs other breeds. It was too general and I did not learn much having owned two other Goldens it did not offer any benefit to me.
5,Nice Discovery,"Oh my, it's nice to discover something that stirs the wonder as much as this music does. These quiet guitar licks are matched only by the quality of this guy's voice. Tracks 3 thru 9 stack up to ANYTHING. And that's after my first listen. What's next?"
2,Check Please!,"This album fell desperately short of my expectations. Granted, this is the only Red House Painters album I own and others may be better. I actually like the instrumentals, but the lyrics are trite, and the vocal melodies try pathetically hard to be interesting. I actually find the songs painful to get through. Unfortunately, if not for the vocals, it may have actually been pretty good.I can't believe there are so many people willing to praise this band and that there aren't more negative reviews. But here's one for you: For generally loving this type and genre of music, I really dislike this album."
5,It's so nice,"It's so nice to have my Dreamcast sitting on my audio-video shelf, instead of sprawled out on the floor a few feet away from my sofa. These extension cords are a must-have ... and (amazingly enough) Amazon's price can't be beat!"
5,Worth the time and cash,"If you've ever used an extension cord on other games, you can just sit back on your couch away from you tv instead of sitting in a chair 4 feet away from your tv crouched over. If you like comfort and extra cord length, this is a good buy."
3,Easy Use - Resets file dates,The software is included in the blue module in the middle of the cable and requires no install for XP(win 98 requires an install). It was very easy to use! I didn't discover until a week later that it had reset the creation and modification dates for ALL files. This was a problem for me so I had to go back and copy to an external hard drive and move the files to retain those settings and then try to merge the files that were changed after that the first copy. BIG PAIN! I'm sure I will still find some uses for the cable when the dates aren't important to me.
1,Data Tranfer,"I am having similar problems as one other review listed: the cable is not working. After eleven attempts it worked once, then hasn't worked again in almost 60 attempts and counting. I constantly receive errors that state the drive is corrupted or the program in not a win32 application. The concept is outstanding, but I question the quality of work and materials the unnamed company put into this product."
1,Zintstall No Response,"I am trying to do a computer and program transfer to a new computer. Zinstalls product seemed perfect. However, I have an issue where I can not open word and I also can not print. I know the printer works fine because my husband hooks up his laptop and no problem he prints just fine. I wanted to know if I transfer I figure I would be transferring the problem. I have e-mailed. I have called and left numerous messages and still after over 3 weeks no call back. I have only been so insistant because what I saw with this company was how easy it was. I am not the most computer literate but not the worst either. Any suggestions out there for a program that transfers file and program and it is easy?????????????thanks greekgoddess"
3,only works with XP computers,"only works with XP computers, a little difficult to set up...take care of the instalation disk...if you lose it...tha cable is worthless...it is not aplug and play device"
1,What a ripoff,There is no way of transfering data with this thing. it only shows local system but no remote system. Save your money don't get this!! waste of time and money. what a load of crap
2,USB-USB cable mislabeled for Mac,"This USB-USB cable was labeled compatible with Mac OS and the bubble pack it came in also claims that, but it is not Mac-compatible.A real bummer..."
1,USB 2 or USB 1.1?,I'm confused. The Title of the cable is USB 2. But the description describes USB 1. So which is it?
2,"Informative, but not complete.","The Dictionary tends to place emphasis on the more ""popular"" martial arts such as Karate and Judo, and in Japanese styles in general. Although the information given pertaining to Japanese styles is very thorough and comprehensive, ""definitions"" given on many other arts (Chinese Gung Fu, Brazilian Capoera, Phillipino Eskrima, etc.)is often lacking. In fact, some, such as French Savat, are completely left out."
