1,terrible toy,My 12month old son received this toy for Christmas and broke it the next day. The tin can music is barely audible and the head of the toy is held on by a thin plastic tube which is not durable in the least bit. I wouldn't recommend this toy to any child of any age.
1,Jack-In-the-Box,"The music does not play well. It takes many, many cranks for it to start and then it is very faint."
5,Wow a must-have,"Let me say that this is a must-have dvd for everyone and their neighbor. Rob Halford and his band is in top form, production is impeccable, and looks great too! Glad to hear a new song called Sad Wings. Comes with a flowing remastered and extended Resurrection cd with great NEW tracks!"
5,WOW!!!! HALFORD'S SOLO BAND IS AMAZING,"HALFORD LIVE AT ROCK IN RIO 3 IS AMAZING. SOUND, PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO THE METAL GOD ARE ALL HERE -- FINALLY!!!!!A MUST BUY FOR ALL METAL FANS."
1,Order not delivered,My order was not delivered. amazon does not help me to resolve the incident. The tranportadora this charging me a very high value tax that was never charged before or on one of my orders here in amazon.quero my order because it already pays. Thank you.Amazon.com order number: 111-8499780-2289800 Alan Lengruber.
4,Solid,"This is a pretty solid live performance of Judas Priest singer Rob Halford's solo band. Like the double bass drumming. Also contains a remastered Resurrection CD with bonus tracks, of which Sad Wings is a highlight. The set list is dominated by Ressurection tracks but also contains songs from Fight and Judas Priest. The crowd sings Breaking the Law at the end and they smash their guitars. Stained Class is a definate highlight from the set list. They basically just stood there and played. There is also a Ressurection World Tour documantary. A worthy purchase, but has limited appeal outiside of devout metal circles. The concert runs about a little more than an hour with end credits."
1,Pop up Shade D-50,The pop up shild is a nice idea but after getting the unit installed I found that it was not the best setup for me. It also puts a lot on the eye piece. May have coused a stress crack to my D-50 Nikon. Not something I would recommend.
1,Inaccurate portrayal of enlisted families,"Though the author claims to have interviewed hundreds of spouses, she obviously choose the three that are the most appealing to someone of her stature (a former officer's wife) and has not displayed the insight for a true portrayal of the Invisible Women. Though the topic is great and many enlisted familes can see parts of themselves in some of the topics or issues, it is not a ""typical"" story of junior enlisted wives. It smacks of sensationalism and stories that keep the tabloids in business. Take this book with a grain of salt, and do not lump an entire group of junior enlisted spouses in the same category of these three women. This is NOT reality as we know it."
2,How not to be a military wife,"I'd like to point out, first of all, that I am an officer's wife. However, I have a much different perspective than that of the author. Apparently, she has known only a handful of enlisted spouses and is not aware of the many resources available in the community where she could have pointed these women toward for help rather than letting them flounder. I've seen enlisted women who went to college and held high paying jobs, I've seen those who were stay at home moms who made ends meet however they could, I've seen those who ran businesses, I've seen those who ran the post's spouses' club, their unit's Family Readiness Group or Red Cross chapters. This is a narrowly focused book, with a microscope on the worst of military life. What's sad is that no information was provided to the public on what help these wives could have found in the military community if they had reached out for help to the appropriate source."
2,Not typical of army life - but it does happen,"As a wife of a new recruit, the book scared me to death.....what had we gotten ourselves in to??? Then in talking with other Army families, active, retired, or just no longer in...these stories are isolated. Yes, bad things happen...civilian or military...that's life. I could write 10 books on how bad our 14 married years of civilian life were! You can take this book and read it, to help you see some of the pitfalls that can occur and hopefully prepare yourself better, or learn from mistakes made in the book. I learned more about Army life by talking to actual people than I did from reading this book. It is extreme!"
2,Most reviews are correct,"I agree that this book gives an inaccurate portrayal of Junior Enlisted wives. I feel like she just picked the worst case scenarios and decided to base the book off that. I'm a Junior Enlisted wife and while at first we struggled a little to get into a routine the fact is we're surviving just fine. There are tons of resources that can be used to help with struggling family and it seems instead of pointing them in that direction she choose to put their life in a book in a way to say ""hey, this is what's going on with the Junior Enlisted families"" which isn't always true. Yes, it does happen but truth is many women have jobs to help out and they are still struggling. And there are families with stay at home parents who are doing better than those with dual income. The fact is she chose to show only the negative side of the Junior Enlisted instead of giving both sides. Not all Junior Enlisted families suffer. Most do just fine."
1,Typical enlisted bashing,"What do you expect from an officers' wife? It's typical enlisted bashing from a has-been. Harrell does nothing more than stereotype young enlisted wives as trailer park trash. Exploiting 3 women and making it seem like the whole lot of enlisted spouses are immature and uneducated is ludicrous. Note to all officers' wives - you're not as important or smart as you think you are. Maybe someone should write a book on some of their flawed, ignorant lives beginning with Ms. Perfect. 1 star out of 5 because ""zero"" isn't an option. Puke!"
4,SONG TITLES LISTED HERE:,"Soft piano-based instrumental christian music, great for background during quiet times, bible study or dinnertime.1. Good Shepherd Here I Am2. Christ Will Come3. Voices4. The Stillness And The Storm5. I Want To Know You6. Which One Gave The Most7. Watching For Me8. The Shepherd's Heart9. Who do You Say That I Am10. Cup Of Blessing11. Holy Spirit Have Your Way"
4,A pretty book,"A book illustrated by K.Y Craft is always a joy to look at. Having said that though, the pictures in this book are not near as beautiful as Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty. Also both Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are hard covers, where this one is soft covered. Even so, it's still a joy to look at and read."
5,wonderfully told,"Marianna Mayer again, does a fantastic job telling the tale. K.Y. Craft does exceptional work with the illustration. Not to nay say K.Y. Craft, because the illustration is indeed fantastic, beautiful and imaginative, but I would also like to see a version of this where Mercer Mayer illustrates as well. Point said, I would still and most definitely want Craft's illustrated version in my children's book collection as well. Nothing is really amiss."
5,Little Princesses will love this book,My 4 year old daughter LOVES this book and has practically memorized every word. It is well worth the money. Have a glass of water handy when reading it because it is quite long. It is beautifully written and the illustrations have a lot of intricate detail and are a perfect fit for the story.
2,CLEP College Algebra,"Book was discolored. Full of marking, many answers were circled. Had scribbling all over it. Did not have CD. Book arrived on time"
2,CLEP test book,This item was supposed to include a CD but it was not with the book when I received it. The seller did not respond to an email I sent asking about the CD
3,"Good, but not great.","Although this book is good to use to brush up on your Algebra skills, it doesn't really help all that much with the actual College Algebra CLEP Test. The book was good at covering the gambit of College Algebra, but lacks in helping to explain the more complex quadratic systems, and graphing problems. It was also weak in helping to explain quadratic sytems using fractions. I still recommend this book over all others that I've seen, but take my advice and get a good College Algebra book to help study the areas of complex systems of equations."
2,Parent of Student,"Purchased this book because my daughter has had great success with the biology, english, and literature rea clep books. This book contained multiple errors that needless confused by daughter. I asked for an errata twice from the publisher but my requests were ignored. After studying this book my daughter received a 57 on the Algebra CLEP exam. At most schools this would have been high enough to receive credit, however her University required a score of 60 to receive credit. One area she found that the book did not cover as completely as needed was in factoring/simplifying polynomials and fractions based on polynomials. If you need a high score to receive credit (above 57) I would not recommend this book."
2,This is not the best book for college algebra,"I took the test today and I realized this book isnt that good. The tests in the book do not cover the real CLEP exam. In the exam,I found a lot of problems I dont know . I passed the exam with 54/80. It doesnt look good, but I passed it!!."
4,good book,"The book is handy for last minute algebra prep. I passed. Although there are some wrong solutions to some problems, but mostly it is helpful since it has 2 sample test with solutions."
3,Not An Extensive Review,"This books provides a course review and 3 practice tests, which is why I purchased it. The problem is that course review lacks a lot of important topics that are on the test. In fact, the practice tests have several questions based on these missing topics. As a result, I had to do online research in order to understand why certain answers were correct."
4,Helped me pass the text,"With the help of this book, and a 3-hour refresher class (free), I passed the Clep test. I graduated much sooner, and didn't have to pay for the class."
3,Kindle edition 2012,"I bought my book for the kindle and the first thing I noticed was that the book had not been edited/ revised since 2007 - so the content is 5 years old! It just came out on Kindle so I expected an updated version. Also, the book is full of typos and is missing parts of the test questions ( didn't transfer onto the e edition properly). Overall the ebook is poorly done and I am not sure how releavant the book is since it's 5 years old. I will take the test in 3 weeks and have mainly used Bob Miller's Accuplacer book for preparation, lots of practice there. I just bought CLEP College Algebra to get a feel for the test and see where I stand."
5,great product for your older more arthritic dog,"my dog had hip surgery and vet suggested this, it has helped her a lot as her xrays have shown."
4,Works!,"I have a female Rottweiler 11 years old, after a few weeks it starts to working releasing her bounds paint and arthritis."
5,F_ _ _ HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH,"THIS ALBUM RULES!!!!! MAX IS AWESOME, He holds nothing back on this album as he rips through 1998 like a axe going through a dead carcus. In a year of weakend rock and washed up boy groups Max and soulfly prove that heavy metal is alive and well, and willing to tear you a new asshole!!!!!"
5,Wonderful!,"Simple perfection. Very funny ... my whole family has enjoyed watching it. Ellen is the funniest woman and one of the very kindest. Watch this, it will actually make you laugh and giggle!"
5,Ellen's the best,"A very funny sitcom, with some lessons to teach along the way. If viewed with an open mind, this show can be laugh-out-loud hilarious. If your mind is already closed, try opening it a little and let Ellen in; you won't be able to keep from loving her."
4,"But of course, I don't have to tell you that!","Ellen is so funny! I used to watch her show every week that it was on. And this season has one of my favorite episodes. This is when one of Ellen's friends brings Martha Stewart to Ellen's dinner party. It is a great episode, and Ellen is at her best. If you are a fan of her talk show, you will appreciate the humor packed into this season!"
5,UC Davis Book of Dogs: The best resource,"I write a dog advice web column called: ASK OKSANA and this is the book that I have recommended to countless readers. It was originally written for vets by the veterinary faculty of UC DAVIS's Vet School, but so many people encouraged the editor to rewrite it so that lay people could understand it, that he finally agreed and has written the ""Bible"" for canine healthcare. Each chapter focuses on a different system (gastro-intestinal, cardiac, etc.) and each chapter is written by a different faculty specialist. The index and dictionary are great. If your dog is diagnosed with Addison's, you can look it up and read all about its causes and treatments. There's a great section on how to find food allergies. It explains complex medical issues in terms that an educated, non-medical professional can understand. If you love your dog, then this is one book you cannot afford to be without! It's a bargain at this price!"
3,"Good, but far from ""complete"", fortunately not expensive.","This book has much good information but fails to cover even items that are currently being researched at UCD -- I was particularly disappointed to find nothing on HOD which has been a plague among the larger dog breeds.Much information -- but far from as the title suggests -- ""complete"". Definately worth the price, however."
4,The Laymans'Merck,"No, this does not have all of the info of the Merck Veterinary Manual, but most dog lovers and owners can be easily frustrated by the medical terminlogy etc. THIS however, is simplified and essential info for the average person to really learn so much about their dogs health. My Merck, this book and ""Symptoms and Solutions"" are my dog bible trio!! I can not tell you how many people I've been able to help w/ dog health problems, solutions and understanding the disease or condition.Worth your money!!"
2,Poorly organized,"Poorly organized. Try looking up something like the common ""kennel cough"" and you will find snippets of information under ""respiratory system"", then refered to infections (viral, then bacterial), but never get a concise, useful idea of the condition. Web site search via Google gives much better discussions."
2,Not That Great,Information on the subjects I have needed has been hard to find and incomplete. I do NOT recommend this book. I'm still looking for a really good general reference.
4,Son loves this but...,"My son received this when he was 1. He played with the driver, little cars and the cab of the truck. Now that he is turning 2, he wants to play with the trailer also. Problem is... that the trailer keeps falling off. It is just a pin that fits into a hole. It is easy to put in, and fall out. I actually had to tape the thing together. Now he loves it again! Would still highly recommend this toy."
3,Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed the book. However, I agree with the Reviewer that said the main character used too many bad cliches. It did seem forced and got to be a little ""too much"". I thought the ending could have had a more interesting twist but I knew that wasn't going to happen because it is a series so all the main characters had to stay in tact."
4,pick your poison,"Though I did enjoy ""Pick Your Poison,"" I found nothing special about it. This book is your run-of-the-mill cozy. The heroine was likable yet not overly special, but the ending pulled this story out of being too commonplace. I never saw the answer coming. I will eventually buy the second installment, ""A Wedding to Die For,"" but there are other books I want to read first.The plot aside, I found the cover art to be the best I've seen in awhile."
2,"I won't buy another one, but good plot twist.","I read constantly and I was sadly disappointed in this story. I did not find the heroine particularly likeable and her endless repeat of her ""Daddy's sayings"" were annoying. I will say I did not see what was coming at the end of the book, which was nice. Kudos to the author for a good twist."
2,Authentic Texas???,"The biggest complaint I have about the book is the endless number of bad clichés the author uses. There were so many I began to count them, and she averages about 1 per chapter! Saying such as ""...it's pouring bullfrogs and heifer yearlings..."" The author seems to have a list of ""catchy"" sayings she felt like she needed to include, but in fact they come across as being forced in the book. I've lived in Texas my whole life, both in the country and the city and I can honestly say I have NEVER heard anybody say ""...when the skies do open up, it will be like a cow peeing on a flat rock."" After so many, they become eye-rolling, ""whatever"" mumbling, ridiculous.The story line itself was intriguing and I did like how everything wrapped up, leaving no loose ends. However, there was very little character development to show how the main character and her potential love interest ever clicked."
1,worst quality ever !,"i was truly astonished, when discovered that dewalt produces such a bad quality items. after observation, discovered that the cetre was uneven and to my opinion ppil was working on creation of this item. i changed my mind about dewalt"
4,Rip Off,I love Societe Roquefort but the price on this is $26.66 a pound and I get it at Trader Joe's for $12.99 a pound.
4,understanding addiction,"I am medical doctor,but not an expert in addiction.With this book ,I couldunderstand some issues about addiction and help one member of my family.I recomend purchase this book if you have problems with addiction or know a friend or a member of your family with this problem."
5,God Bless You Nat...Your Greatly Missed!!!!,"There are many popular crooners who have graced record labels, such as Bing, Frank, Dino, and Perry, but Nat was THE KING for many. I was truely surprised at the wonderful remastering of his timely music. There will never be another one like him. He is UNFORGETABLE!!!! A DEFINATE FIVE STAR RECORDING!!!!"
3,"Where's ""Ramblin' Rose"" ?","Why buy a collection that's missing one of his best songs? Instead, check out NAT KING COLE - THE GREATEST HITS, also on Capitol from 1994. Nicely mastered, and you get all the important songs from this collection along with ""Ramblin Rose""."
1,"locks up, no support, buy something else",We bought a Magellan 6000t and it started locking up right away. We had to reset every day loosing all info. Called Magellan after 30 days they won't send me a new one or return money. It locked up 10 times on the way to Florida and when it was working the touch screen would stop working. Tried to take me down countless oneway streets in Tampa. The worst electronic product and support of any product/company I have ever experienced. Wish I had bought a Garmin. I have two Garmin products on my boat and they have preformed flawlessly for years.
4,Great system,"We tested the GPS over 4,000 miles in variable terrain. It is more accurate then Google Earth. We love the portability. The order of the POI categories should, however, be flexible and tailorable to the prefences of the user."
2,Hope you don't need customer service,"The devil is in the details. The unit works as advertised, but the ""lock ups"" are something I've never encountered before. I have a built-in unit in my car, and it has never locked. My 600T locked so severely once, I couldn't even turn it off or reset. That brings up customer service. I called twice, and my wife called twice, and neither of us could understand what the reps were trying to say. Offshore CS is NOT OK if the reps don't speak the language of the customer - or vice versa. Also be aware that this unit is officially ""not a current offering."" Wonder when the support will stop? The unit came without a manual, so if you want instructions to take with you, be prepared to print out 140 or so pages. All in all - not impressed with Magellan. The good news is the price has been reduced by 2/3."
3,last year's technology,"Good for the price I paid, but lacks sophistication. Has many flaws including an awkward power button and two top-mounted zoom buttons. They get pressed inadvertently any time you pick up the device. I like the bluetooth, but don't like the fact I have to pay [dearly] for map updates. Directions are close but wrong many times, telling me I have arrived at my destination on the right when it is on my left. I find it difficult to void a route to begin a another. I navigate the menu in circles trying start a new route. Next time maybe I will get one with less bells and whistles - and just get one that gets me there. I don't use the mp3 player and photo viewer anyway."
3,It's Great - When It Works!!!,"The Magellan 6000T is incredibly easy to learn and easy to use. It gives me confidence to go places that I otherwise would be uncomfortable trying to navigate, since I'm not great with a map.The downside: it locks up constantly, and sometimes re-setting it just doesn't happen. Therefore, I don't feel confident that I can ALWAYS count on it, and that's a bummer.When it's good, it's very very good . . . when it's bad, it's horrid!"
2,"Great navigation, but unreliable","It does a great job of navigating, but my first unit that I received for Christmas would not allow me to save my created addresses and system preferences to a back up memory card. As a result, I had to rebuild all of my data each time the unit locked up (fairly frequently). Additionally, the ""repeat last instruction"" feature didn't work. Called tech support, and they couldn't help me, so I exchanged the unit. When the second unit arrived, the ""repeat last instruction"" feature did not work on this unit either, but it would back up my data to a memory card. Three weeks later, that too quit working, so I've returned it for a refund."
2,Works Well But Has Flaws,"Have had this unit for about 3 months now and have to reset it maybe once a week which is a pain and you lose your data at times when you do that. It locks up or a feature stops working like the voice commands and then you have to reset. The bluetooth is not worth the extra money since the speaker is too low at top volume. I can't see any benefit to the picture or MP3 options either, so I'd go basic if you get a Magellan RoadMate unit. This does work well and has great features when it is working."
4,Gets me where I want to go!,"Most satellite and tower-driven gadgets do not work well where I live in northern Wisconsin. Cell phone service is limited and very poor (Verizon, Sprint, T-mobile do not even bother with us), so I was a little shaky about buying a GPS. Much to my surprise the 6000T works great here. One of its main uses is for me to find my way back to boat landings on small lakes located deep in the forests. Fishing the large popular lakes here in the summer is a joke with all the skiers, PWC's, and other assorted floating junk people bring north to tear around on the water.It also gets me into and out of the cities, like Wausau, Madison, and Milwaukee when I am forced to go there for one reason or another. I would never find my destinations or the way back through them to I-39 (Hwy 51) without it!!!Once in awhile, though, it will try to send me on a tangent. But I have heard this is not unusual for other GPS's, too."
4,Great GPS,"This is a great GPS. I bought it for GPS and Bluetooth capabilitieswhich work great. Very accurate and powerful gps.Do not intend to use photo viewer or music player as I have otherproducts that duplicate these functions.I like the option of using touch screen or most functions are represented by a button you can push instead, most new Garmin and Tom Tom models do not have buttons any longer. Re-route calculations are instantaneous. Have not tried traffic alert function yet. Used this GPS on vacations and it worked perfectly.Cons : text to speech could be clearer but still good but garmin is betterin this dept."
1,Magellan 6000T Trouble,"I received my Magellan 6000T about 3 weeks ago. After 2 weeks and usingit 3 or 4 times I realized that the directions being given were not accurate.About that time the unit stopped working. I called the Magellan repair center and the technician thought that the hard drive might be bad and said that I should send it to Fort Worth Texas which I did. After a week I called the technical support and found that they cannot locate my unit. As of now about 3 and one half weeks, I have no new unit and it cannot be located and I'm convinced I will not have it for my trip. I think this speaks bad of the product as well as the service. Only time will tell and I will probably have to buy another GPS (maybe a Garmin) for the trip."
2,Problem with Magellan RoadMate 6000T,"We purchased the Magellan RoadMate 6000T for a trip cross country. We arrived with only one misdirection, which Magellan quickly recalculated and sent us in the right direction. We love this unit, but it will NOT backup our information. I tried 3 different SD cards and had Magellan Customer Service walk me through the process several times. Finally on the third call to Customer Support, while they put me on hold I researched this problem on the internet and found it to be a common one. Customer Support could only advise me to send it back to be serviced; they never admitted this can be an issue.To make the calls to customer service even more challenging, each time I called the person on the other end of the phone, had difficulty understanding me, and I to, had difficulty understanding them.We currently live in a very high traffic area, and never leave home without it, but we are planning to return it after our new Garmin arrives."
4,wonderful,"It's a wonderful and great product, but i don't know how to sinc.my cell phone to the bluetooth.Great buy for the Bucks!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,IT CAME TO US HOT.THEY SAID THROW AWAY.AND WOULD REPLACE.THEY DID NOT.WE PUT A CLAIM IN TO AMAZON AND GOT MONEY BACK. do not buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Salmon and perfect for vegetarians???,How can it be made from flesh and be perfect for vegetarians? How misleading!
3,Subject Matter Great-Disk 4 Not So Much,"I have always loved Jacques and Julia's show. My VCR versions (home recorded) were getting old so I thought I would replace them. I ordered one set and the 4 disk got stuck on the last of the programs (on roast duck). As I love duck I sent them back and reordered another set. This set came back with a small skip again on the last disc this time on the ""potatoes"" show. This time it just skips for a second or two, annoying yes, but I can still watch the show. I decided not to return this set since I wasn't sure what show I would lose with the next reorder and I really do have a life."
5,Excellent!!!,I bought this for my sister and she was very pleased with the book. She has a hard time putting the book down she loves it so.
4,Beware of the Brown Stock!,"I was gratified to see that another reader noticed the error of omission for the Brown Stock recipe.Only half of the recipe is printed. I hope this is the exception and not the rule.I haven't read the entire book yet.Otherwise,it's a very enjoyable book which makes gourmet cooking feel very approachable for even beginning level cooks.The recipes are not fussy but are based on the idea that good technique and quality ingredients produce great tasting food.Julia & Jacques seem very relaxed & friendly and their writing is too.They give a wealth of really helpful tips on all aspects of food preparation.This book has given me both the confidence and interest to delve into French/gourmet cooking for the first time.In conjunction with their PBS series the books really comes alive. A good basic gourmet primer."
4,"Not the best, but a good read","Other reviewers have indicated that this book is good for novices or young cooks. I agree that the recipes are neither challenging nor new, but there is more to a great cookbook than recipes. Here you will find people who love food and writing about cuisine and enticing you to love the art as well. For that reason, I give this book four stars. Had the recipes been a little more enlightening, then certainly a five star book."
5,A Combination of Two Great Chefs!,"I have followed Julia Child and Jacques Pepin's careers for nearly 30 years on Public Television, individual series and through their cookbooks. This is the ULTIMATE cookbook.The cutest section is where the two chefs tell US the best way to cook a hamburger. Leafing through the pages brings a big smile to my face when I remember Jacques actually doing what he wanted even if Julia had countermanded him earlier.Get this cookbook!"
3,"""The Way to Cook"" is better","Julia's ""The Way to Cook"" has been my favorite cookbook for years. Many of her recipes are included in this book, and they are fabulous. I wouldn't recommend buying this book if you already own ""The Way to Cook"" because the format is not as easy to follow."
5,"It's the food, stupid","Economy be damned, it's food that enriches our lives! In this book, we have finally found the elusive solution to cooking great food from simple recipes and techniques. Buying the right ingredients, trimming and preparing it properly, and creating ""home-cooked"" dishes that are out of this world. Think of a home-cooked dish you love, and they show you how to do it right -- pot pie, stuffed cabbage, meatloaf, grilled cheese (croque monsieur), onion soup, the whole lot -- nothing pedestrian about these recipes. They are elegant, simple to do, with easy to follow instructions and endlessly amusing to read. If a person can love a cookbook, this is the one."
2,Great Content but Lousy Packaging,"I learn much more from watching the two great masters in TV than reading their cook books. I was really looking forward to receive these 4-disc DVDs. Unfortunately when the package arrived, two of the discs were not secured inside the box and there were deep scratches on the surface of the discs. I returned the set and asked for a replacement. The second package arrived with the same problem. A La Carte, the distribution, could have come up with a better packaging than cramping 4 discs inside a single box. I decided to keep the merchandize because I really treasure this TV series. But if you are not as crazy as I am, don't buy this set until the distributor comes up with a better package."
5,the best ever,"Charming! Two magnificent friends who happen to be magnificent cooks. Helps one be comfortable with the ""art"" of cooking wherein ingredients can be as varied as a creative chef wishes. the best kitchen series ever on TV, period."
3,cooking for dummies,"As a huge fan of both Julia and Jacques,all I can say was it wasn't the kind of book I expected from either of one of these culinary geniuses. It was literally ""cooking for dummies"" or first time wanna-be cooks.The step be step procedures,(from both of them on the same item)was tedious and boring.But I'm sure it would be fine like I say for ""novices""in the kitchen.I personally returned it..T.R. Redding"
5,This is an excellent text,This is an excellent text for learning english.I had to learn structures of English in mycomputational linguistics course at my Univ.This book helped me to pass.
2,They didn't work.,"I bought three of these bits to use with my Milwaukee 3/8"" hammer drill to drill a drainage hole in my 11"" thick concrete and mortar brick garage wall. It took about 5 minutes to drill a hole about 5 inches into wall and the bit wouldn't go any farther. Thinking I may have dulled the bit I used the next two bits and tried for another 10 minutes and couldn't penetrate any further. I didn't get any shavings from rebar or anything, just no penetration. Thinking I hit a bluestone I gave up. My neighbor saw I was having a problem and I asked him if he had a drill and a long bit that he could try. He went through my hole and drilled another 6 inches inches into the wall in about 3 minutes."
5,Very Good Edition of the NKJV,"While Cambridge makes the best Bibles Thomas Nelson has donea wonderful job with this edition of the NKJV. In fact I wishthey had a KJV just like it for my collection! The leather isvery nice and the text is quite good, with good cross references.I also like it that the text is black letter, not red letter.This is a very good edition of the NKJV, in fact it might be thebest NKJV Bible in print. The NKJV is a good literal translationand it still retains the beautiful literary sound of the KJV.There are some who believe that this is the version formemorizing Scripture. Again, this is an excellent edition of the NKJV.Good job Thomas Nelson!!!"
5,awesome - simply & purely perfect - better than the bosch,I bought this drill bit do drill drop in anchors into concrete.... this bit is simply awesome. IT totally beat out the BOSCH Blue bits by far.... it has a better carbide drill head to it and it lasts much more than the bosch bits. i'm not saying the bosch bits are bad.... but this dewalt bit had more flex to it and drilled much faster and sayed sharper longer.... plus it was a few dollars cheaper via amazon prime !!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"More of the same, as the trilogy concludes. If you have read the others, you know what to expect, with a bit more of an emphasis on what is going on. The friends and protagonists are mastering their powers, finding out what is going on, and having sex not quite as often, at least on page, anyway."
3,Good but not as good as sex gates.,This was good but not as good as Sex Gates (5 stars for that one!) It's still an enjoyable fast read. It does seem to get off topic a little about halfway through but get's back on track.I'm am definitely going to read the sequel.Series overall is highly recommended.
4,this brand is great!,"This brand is great for my fish! They get so colorful and bright after eating the plankton! I have to try the tubifex worms next, but hikari is an awesome brand for fish food! Great product and fast shipping!"
4,"Good food, but big pieces","This is a pretty good food. It is fresh; it was sealed with a small stay-fresh insert. The entire top comes off so I can easily take one out. It is packaged in cubes that I can break up to take out just what I need for my small community. However the individual pieces are a bit big for my guppies. They seem to like them and try to pick at them so I do us the food, but the pieces really are a bit large. They seem to swell up in the water, too. Plus it is kind of creepy seeing their little eyes."
4,Very good book for class,"I had to get this book for my class at college. So i really don't know what to say because I didn't wanna buy it but kinda had too. These books are very simple to read. They give yous step by step directions on how to get to everything on windows. Even though i really don't need the class, it is a good book for those of you who would love to learn windows inside and out!"
3,Many features...less than stellar quality,"While this saw boasts all the features one could ask for, the quality is lacking in areas that affect the accuracy of cuts and the operation. Typical of poor quality Chinese tools, the castings do not line up accurately, making some of them unusable (such as the right side fence). There are bolt holes without bolts. The miter lock is easily bumped off it's setting. The alloy metal housing is soft like plastic. The laser worked for about 2 minutes. Other than these annoyances, this is a lot of saw for the money. Remove the supplied blade and install a good quality 60 tooth miter saw blade. Buy this saw very cheaply, or you won't like it."
4,All the professional features at an afordable price,If you need a professional powertool but can't afford the price tag then check these out. I was using one of these on a recent job over in Canada building a hardwood decks and other outdoor entertaining areas for a community house.The double bevel feature saves a lot of time by not having to spin the boards over to do opposite 45deg cuts.The laser line generator also saved time as it speed up the alignment of blade vs. cutting line.I was also using mirboo decking boards and found the powertool had plenty of power to handle this hardwood.I can vouch first hand that this is no toy for anyone looking for some muscle and features of the tradional pro brands
1,Junk!!,"I have found this saw to be inaccurate and range of adjustment to be poor. If you want a homeowner piece of equipment, that you don't plan on using more than a couple of times this could be the saw for you. It lacks accuracy in both miter modes with limited pointer adjustment to zero out. The brake mechanism in miter mode is plastic and wears quickly so that I will not lock in any position. The detents for locking in miter mode are also badly machined and a true cut can not be accomplished because of the slop."
5,compound miter saw with laser,"the saw was as advertised, new in the box, and just what I need for my work. the added laser speeds up the cutting process."
3,Strong Smell,"I just started taking this brand. I admired the cheaper price, but I probably wont buy this brand again because the smell of these pills are very strong and I dislike that. Also and the pills are a little larger, like the size of a round Tylenol. Which isn't that huge, but the Source Naturals one is half the size.I prefer Source Naturals instead for about $3 more, (link below) because the smell is not strong like this one, and the size of the pill is half the size of this one and they are both the same mgs.Source Naturals OPC-85 Pine Bark Extract 50mg, 30 TabletsBut still a great product for a very good price."
3,review of movies you must see..,It was a interesting book I used a required book for my class and I learned about allot of different movies that otherwise i would never known about. So i do recommended for someone that wants a guide to movies to maybe watch.
1,Unnecessary,"Yet another book by a film professor telling us we ""must"" watch Citizen Kane, The Searchers, The 400 Blows, Annie Hall. Yawn, yawn, yawn. I saw this book at a bookstore the other day and read through most of it while I was waiting for a friend to arrive. it doesn't tell you anything more interesting than the stuff you can read for free at the Internet Movie Database, and Leydon's list of ""important"" films is the same old boring list we've seen again and again. There was something called Guadalcanal Diary that I supposedly ""must"" see that I've never heard of, but otherwise nothing new at all."
1,Retread reviews,"A collection of weak reviews from some pretentious, second-rate local film critic. I made the mistake of buying this book a few months ago. Since then I've found some that are so much better, including:* The Great Movies by ROGER EBERT* 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die by Steven Jay Schneider* The 100 Best Films to Rent You've Never Heard Of by David Meyer* Never Coming To A Theater Near You: A Celebration of a certain kind of movie by Kenneth Turan"
5,A must read,"I bought Joe Leydon's book because I have always enjoyed reading his witty, thoughtful reviews in Variety. So I came in with high expectations, and this book delivers. Movies You Must See uses a unique structure to guide the reader through a film school's worth of great films. After reading this enjoyable book, you will not only have a bunch of classic movies to rent, but you will have truly learned something."
5,Hard to put down,"I bought this book 2 days ago during the SXSW Film Festival here in Austin -- the author was signing copies at a booth in the convention center -- and I thought I'd wait until later on to finish it. But it's so much fun to read, I've been devouring it between screenings and when i get home, and it's clear this guy really loves his movies. Really entertaining, not snooty at all. I wish I had someone like this when I was back in college."
4,best air compressor on market for homeowner/contractor,"I just couldn't believe it this compressor kept up w/2nailers and is real quite compared to the oil-less type, I would highly recommend this for the homeowner/contractor. The only problem I had was to set the proper air pressure for the tools. Took me a couple tries but, once set this little champ kept up. This one is to be the one of the best air compressor on the market. WAY TO GO PORTER CABLE"
5,Brilliant Insight In A Simplified Approach To Film Acting,"Jeremiah's ability to convey such a clean and concise approach to film acting is endlessly refreshing, especially to the working actor overhwhelmed by the endless masses of techniques and methods out there. He strips acting down to its very essence and truth through his emphasis on being in the moment and on developing ones skills of observation and listening. His simple wisdom reminds us of what we already know-- what we knew as children and chose to forget-- the endless wonder of a human face, the natural expression of unjudged emotion, how to live openly in the present without expectation, to trust unwaveringly in the given circumstances. Truly a great work and one every actor, director, artist or film enthusiast should have. I will read this book again and again and I do not doubt that one day it will be a staple in any serious actor's collection. Excellent."
5,A must read,"Jeremiah has an honest approach when presenting this book. It is very useful, and a definite book to have on your shelf. I have found myself unable to put it down. I would recommend this book for any type of actor wanting to understand and practice his craft too the best of his ability."
1,If it floats your boat...,"First of all, let me just say that while I did not like this book, I think that if it strikes a chord with you and gives you new insight, that is AWESOME. For me personally, I found this book extremely disappointing. I found it to be redundant with most first acting classes (as in, first acting class of your life). Of course, many acting books DO reiterate those things we first learned, and it CAN be inspiring, in a ""that's so simple, and I forgot that"" kind of way. So, didn't float my boat, and I think other books are way better. Check out Michael Caine's book on film acting, for instance. I didn't find this book to have any new insights, however."
5,Best Book...,"The Art of Film acting is a book that should be in every actors hands. Before I studied with Jeremiah and read his book I thought I knew what acting was. I was wrong. I learned the process he teaches and it all makes sense now. Before I wasn't booking jobs... but after his words and methods I learned the most brilliant thing an actor can learn, Jeremiah Comey gets the credit for that! I work in television and film all the time now.. Hands down get this book!"
5,Great stuff!,"This is wonderful stuff.... It's true that it doesn't mix quite as easily as you'd hope, but the best thing to do is to put the powder and an equal amount of liquid, then stir until its a thick liquid. Then, gradually add the rest of whatever liquid you want to it and it should be smooth. Better yet, add it to pudding or something. :)"
4,One of the few powders available for children,"This powdered probiotic is one of the few I could find that wasn't in a pill form, suitable for my 9 month old. His doctor recommended a probiotic when he had intestinal problems, but at first I was opening capsules and mixing them, a tedious process. This is much better!The package says ""mixes easily"" which is not entirely true, it takes a little effort to get it all the way mixed into a liquid like juice.There is also a great chewable form by Nature's Way, that tastes like candy and works well for older kids with back teeth.I found it in the refrigerated area of our grocery's health food section, next to the organic yogurt and such. I would wonder about shipping it - it would lose refrigeration that way? Best check with the shipper directly."
2,The athlete always stays ahead of the scientist.,"It's an OK book,but Ed Burke's book guided by Dave Scott is more practical."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I have read ost of Sally Edwards' other books, and Smart Heart combined everything already covered and takes the level of intensity to a new level. I don't consider myself to be a great athlete, but this book has helped me stay in good shape and monitor my workouts."
2,Not for me this one !,"First time I heard his voice, I was half sleeping on my coach with a French TV show running on tV. I was imagining a big tall black jazz man singing and playing piano and then I discovered this skinny white young guy and I found it astonishing !!! His music was so great, so smooth, so jazzy and easy listening, I had to get his cds immediatly ! Since then, I had bought all his cds (Fit to serve, That's me in the bar) and always this same joy and happiness just listening to it. But I must confess that for Transit, the magic did not happen... I do not even recognize his voice, so dear to me, on this album. To my opinion it is just common music, nothing really extraordinary. His style is not the same... it is pop music only... Please, Please A.J ...! give us jazz, blues, give us what you're best at ! I'am waiting your next album and I love You !!!!"
1,Who made this album!?!,"AJ is an incredible talent, but I think he was kinapped by aliens or lost a bet. This is not his style at all and is less than impressive. This stuff sounds more like something played at the end credits of a film than the bluesy soul filled tunes I love him for. AJ WHAT HAPPENED?!?!"
2,New album is uninteresting,"Even though I am an AJ Croce fan, this album did very little for me. After buying Fit to Serve and his debut album and seeing him live, I though he was a great original talent. On Transit every song sounds about the same. They are bland and monotonous and he seems to be forcing the so called ""textured vocals"". Whoever produced this seems to have decided they could take a interesting talent with lots of originality and turn it into a manufactured sound that anyone could reproduce. If you want good music stick to his first few albums."
5,Delightful toy,"I've had this toy for quite a few years, and it's still in great shape. I have enjoyed the mouse, and my son is enchanted with it as well. He's been asking for my mouse for a long time, so he's getting his own for Christmas! Well made, great toy!"
4,Fun with the French,"If you are fond of the French, but sometimes find their ways a tad puzzling...or infuriating....the ""Merde"" series is for you. So much fun, quick reads, often laugh-out-loud. Nice bubbly glass of champagne."
4,Better than the first!,"After reading A Year in the Merde by Stephen Clarke I thought I would give it's sequel, In the Merde for Love, a chance while the first was fresh in my mind. I was not overly fond of the first book but it was interesting and funny enough for me to try the next. What a nice surprise to find myself laughing out loud through nearly every page! This book was not only funnier but Mr. Clarke's writing is better and he seems to have grown up a bit. I have recommended this book to everyone who has read the first with the assurance that they will like this one much more."
2,Disappointing,"Half way through the book, Clarke forgot that he was supposed to continue being funny. As others have pointed out, there are some great laughs. Unfortunately, after the midpoint, they disappear. The rest of the book is not mysterious and held my attention only because I was hoping the humor would return. Unfortunately, it didn't. In fact, the book ends on a rather poor attempt at a joke."
2,Many errors in the Kindle edition,"While the book itself is funny to some degree (although I have been captivated by other books much more), I had to notice that the Kindle edition I received contains many errors. Some of these errors seem to stem from the OCR (optical character recognition) process (for example ""rn"" is shown as ""m""), others are more severe such as complete sentences that seem to be missing. Overall, the number of errors start to be an annoyance when reading the book. I would expect from official Kindle editions that costs 10 or 15 dollars that they are at least proof-read to iron out such issues."
2,Disappointing,"I should have listened to the negative reviews on Amazon: This book is not worth buying. The flow is choppy and plodding, the situations contrived, the people uninteresting, and the ""humor"" boring. The author seems to have lost the light and sure touch he exhibited in ""A Year in the Merde"". Don't waste your money!"
4,Chicago Pneumatic CP875,The boss says so far so good. Everyone seems to like them. We purchased 3 of them and they are all in use. We will have to see how they hold up.
4,Good Die Grinder,"No complaints on this, arrived quickly, works well, speed is easily controlled with feathering of the trigger, usually find CP tools pretty reliable and decent quality, the tool is made in taiwan, happy enough with it."
5,still works well after several months of daily use,"I am a long time full time Deburr operator at an Aerospace manufacturing company and have been using this tool as well as the CP straight motor version of this too and I use these two tools very aggressively on very hard metals for several hours a day now for several months for 4 days a week. I put the oil in it at the beginning of every work day and do my job and it still works as good today as it did several months ago. It also has alot of speed and torque which is what I need when I'm blending metal surfaces of titanium, 15-5 stainless. and inconel"
1,Agree plastic gear housing/ junk,"Do not buy this unless you want a plastic, yes plastic gear box for the hammer mechanism and gear transmission, with cheap sleeve bushings not ball or roller bearings. I have the older made in USA model this replaced , that has a cast metal gearbox, real bearings and cost less than this. What a sham. I have many DW tools and wrote this to warn others."
2,Did not last,"I used this drill for about a year. Because of the dual speed and hammer/drill combo it is very versatile. However, it burned up on me tonight while running some screws into concrete. I expect my tools to last a lot longer than 1 year. I would recommend that you look at the Milwaukee or Bosch if you plan on doing anything other than light work."
1,I'm sorry for useing yellow again,"I purchased this drill from Home depot, I used to be in construction, Now Farming. The first burned up on me. The second one the chuck wouldn't tighten and hold the bit While impacting. The third one the plastic gears inside stripped as they did on all my Dewalt drills. There is a recall on alot of dewalts, for switches burning up, getting hot or just dont work. I was a faithfull yellow customer, but if you dont want to get stuck with this drill after three months buy Rigid. I am now going to garage sale all my dewalts and replace them. I also took them apart and replaced the updated switches and plastic gears, this by the way is regular maintenance if you use you tools is a proffession. Maybe dewalt should advertise these as light duty use tools, for the weekend warrior."
2,Won1t hold bit,"The chuck that comes with this drill is of very poor quality, I WON`T HOLD THE BIT!!! and if you use a long bit it will wobble!"
2,Disappointing,Carol Angier did not do any real research for this book. She wrote it on assumptions she made and material she drew from Primo Levi's books. I read about 300 pages and did not bother any more. I just read a great biography of Primo Levi called Primo Levi: A Life by Ian Thomson. What a striking difference. Thomson clearly did his homework and a real picture of Primo Levi and the world at that time emerged.Don't even bother with the Angier book. She is all over the map and discusses novels and throws out so many names that are not even related to the task at hand that her book is rendered incomprehensible and a total waste of time.
2,OK,This is an OK Book. Much of the stuff you see in this book is available in SDK docs too. There are not many good examples.
3,The Case for Expanding the HS English Canon,"Liz Whaley and Liz Dodge have written a reader-friendly textbook that argues that teachers need to give their students a realistic mirror of the world as reflected in literature. Acknowledging that women have for years been excluded or minimized in the anthologies available to high school students, Whaley and Dodge discuss how teachers must move beyond the texts. Students should be guided toward reading the work of women writers and other minority writers. Some practical suggestions are offered via annotated bibliographies for each chapter. Useful. However, the chapters themselves sometimes belabor the point."
3,to easy too chew,"I think the different shape made it easier for my puppy to chew it up, he has the round ones that have lasted a long time. The material seems the same."
4,fun while it lasts!,My yellow lab pup loves this football. He catches it and runs like crazy. I know that when he decides to give this toy a chewing it won't last five minutes. The rubber is light and pliable which is why it's such a good retrieving toy. For now we are having fun and I'm trying to keep him in good chews - antlers & bullies - so he won't destroy this fabulous football.
2,Dog doesn't play with it,"I have a playful lab but my dog doesn't really know what to do with this toy. I think she has a hard time getting a hold of it. Small, simple balls are better. Or empty plastic bottles...."
3,Fun but not sturdy,My dogs loved this ball and had lots of fun getting biscuits out of it -- for a day. Within 24 hours my collie mix had chewed a giant hole in it. Maybe less powerful chewers would do better with this ball.
3,Ok toy,"It's hard to review this because my dogs want no part of this toy. I thought that they would really enjoy chewing on and playing with it. One of my dogs likes to fetch and when she chases it, she just looks at it and walks back. I think that for the right dog, this would be a great toy. It seems that with the holes in it, it would be easy for them to grab and it looks like it would hold up well to chewing. It just didn't work for my dogs."
2,Not for chewers,I have a 55lb female pit bull that loves to chew. She loved this toy but destroyed it in 30 minutes. She ripped it up one small piece at a time.
5,little dog big chew,"This toy has lasted two weeks with no damage. It is light weightthe open spaces make it easy for ""Jacques"" to catch and hold.It has become a favorite."
2,Not as Good as It Claimed,"Pros: easy to hold onto, smells good, lightweightCons: claims to be ""long-lasting"" but it lasted less than a week with our 10 month old German shepherd"
5,Great dog football,Our ridgeback puppy loves this toy. Good for a large dog. Soft yet strong and lightweight.
1,A great disappointment,"The box says that the instrument comes tuned for immediate enjoyment. It did not and I am still trying to get it tuned. Because two notes share one string (the strings on the harp are looped), it is hard to tune it. You can fix one of the notes and mess up the other one. There are no instructions on how to tune one note without ""untuning"" the other one. You can purchase a brochure on tuning for $5 plus $8 shipping, but that should have come with the instrument."
5,Who says you can't investigate and entertain,"For years I have reached for the New York Times whenever I saw Don Van Natta's byline. As one of the nation's top investigative reporters, his stories were always incrediblly well written and chock full of insider information that most of the times his subjects would rather not reveal. He found out and reported facts but never forgot the importance of color and detail and good old fashioned story telling. First off the Tee combines these traits into a highly entertaining book that brings these Presidents and the pasttime they share with millions of Americans to life. I gave it to my husband for his birthday and he read it in a weekend but not until I had finished it. I work in politics and he loves golf and we both loved the book. You can't do better than that."
4,Funny presidential golf anecdotes,"I bought this book for my father-in-law but I enjoyed reading it when I visited him. Good for any golfer that likes to read, or for someone who enjoys presidential history. Most of the anecdotes have no quoted source, so who knows if they've been embellished, but that doesn't spoil the book."
1,a bore,"This book is not only poorly written and boring..it also contains much of the same information that was in a much-better earlier book; ""Presidential Lies: The Illustrated History of White House Golf"" by Shep Campbell and Peter Landau. This book by Van Natta doesn't offer anything new or noteworthy and is not as exciting or amusing to read. Plus the author brags that he played with Clinton. So what? Clinton will play with just about any journalist who asks. For the real deal, definitely check out ""Presidential Lies."""
4,Pretty satisfied customer,"I bought the book for a very good price as ""used"" but it was practically brand new. There were no highlights, ripped pages or underlinings in the textbook. The cover was in great condition as well. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the fact that it took about 3 weeks to get to my house. Other than that, I was very pleased with the quality of the textbook and the price."
5,Saladin is great.,"This book provides lots of insight for the student who likes to put it in context. Other similar titles do not relate the material in such a functional way that promotes comprehension over memorization. I bought this text as a supplement to another text assigned by my professor, and cannot live without it."
4,"""Great Illustrations, they are true human pictures""","The detail pictures are magnificent. They use real human models, and it gives you a better understanding of what your reading by using bodies like your own."
3,Okay book...assumes previous knowledge of biological processes.,"The author of the book assumes that the reader has a previous knowledge of the biological processes involved in the structure and function of the human body...as a result, no in depth descriptions are provided, just generalizations."
2,constructive criticism,"Book is to technical,uses too much complex rhetoric to explain something simple, needs to be broken down better."
2,TORE UP,"This item was suppose to be used in good condition, it was missing the cover and pages are damaged and coming unbound. I didn't even know if it was the right book or edition. Makes it hard to study I have to be super carefull not to damage more."
1,not as stated,"the item i received was not at all as stated in the add. not a gibson cable, no light, not silver clad... just a basic hdmi cable."
4,return to eden,i originally received the wrong disk but that was quickly fixed. now i am very happy with the service and the quality of these disk
1,Return To Eden non usa formaat,this is a one of the most enjoyable movies that i saw a few year ago have been trying to get it in english/ us format have not been able to get i ordered the wrong dvd by mistake can not use in Bermuda any help you can do i would be greatly appreciate
5,It's remarkable collection item,"I have watched this novel put into screen when I was in Saudi Arabia because the British company whom I have friend works there lend me the tape and they have a find collection of video library. The story really very arresting cause full of intrigue, suspense, mystery and of course vengeance at the end."
1,a very ordinary cd,"i was very excited to get this cd after reading all of the great reviews but after listening to it for a week or so i am just not impressed. it is not bad enough to never listen to it again, but i think i would take my money back if i had a chance."
2,Such a let-down.....,"After the magic of ""Silence"", I had great hopes for Tara's follow up album. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it fell well short of expection. Her voice is as good ever. But the songwriting isn't is sharp and the constant drum beat throughout the CD is extremely annoying. Sometimes music has enough life in it without some European guy adding what he thinks is a hip beat.Some people have compared this album to one of Sarah McLachlan's, let me say, it's not, and for people to make such comparisons without being able to spell Sarah's surname is totally freaky. Sarah is a Canadian, a woman, and a singer, that's where the similarities finish.Tara's still good, I'll look forward to album number three, but hopefully the next one will have the power and grace of her first."
5,one of my favorites,"This is the second album from Tara MacLean. Ever since I accidently picked up her first album ""Silence"" in a record store, I awaited her second album. When it came out I bought it immediately and absolutely loved it. MacLean's voice is amazing. Often compared to Sarah McLachlan but lyrically like Jewel, MacLean may actually surpass both artists. Unfortunately, Tara MacLean will seldom be heard on any radio station, but don't let that hold you back. This is an album that is well worth getting. Try to find clips of the songs and if you like what you hear, give it a whirl. My favorite songs from this album are: ""Dry Land"", ""Shakota"", ""Settling"", and ""Jericho"". I could honestly list most of the songs, so I will just say that this is one of my favorite albums and I would love to see a new album by Tara MacLean."
1,This album just isn't aspiring or musically fulfilling,When I bought Silence Tara's first album I took a chance and was surprised how good everything was from the music to her voice but with this album the total opposite rings true...a really boring album with very weak lyrical writing and but she was on the right track with her first album but what happened? Buy Silence if you get anything from her
2,Bad Use of a Great Voice,"I heard Divided on a promo MP3 and I decided I had to buy the CD. It is such a cool song and she has such a riveting voice. Unfortunately, Divided and If I Fall are the only good songs on the CD. The remaining songs all sound like the same song! I think I would have had to loose my dog or experienced a serious breakup before I even suffered through the rest of the CD."
1,a no go,"I bought both of maclean's abulms and so far have listened to passenger. she has a lovely voice, but the music is basically boring, except for the song which wasn't written by her. I would hesitate to buy any of amazon's recommended up and coming artists now. I feel like I wasted my money. I hope that Silence has alot more to offer than Passenger, because I've already opened the seal on it. will prolly trade these for something else if possible. if you like syrupy, upbeat music that sounds vaguely like it's preachy christian music though, you'll prolly enjoy it."
2,Very disappointing,"Considering Sarah McLachlan (after milking us fans with the same songs for so long) is taking a break, Nettwerk Productions probably thought ""let's make a Sarah # 2"". They did. Well, sort of. This cd is dull and Tara rarely uses her voice in an expressive way so the listener can become interested in her songs. Lyrically, she's weak as well. Musically it's good and she can have a good voice, as she shows in the wonderful ""If I Fall"". I won't say to pass on Tara MacLean, but if she becomes popular I hope Nettwerk doesn't milk us with her like they did Sarah ""I have no new songs"" McLachlan."
4,"If for ""Jordan"" alone...","... you should get this album immediately. While it took me a few listens to really embrace the rest of the album, Jordan was always the standout track. There's something very uplifting about the structure of the song itself, the way it's crafted. Tara uses her full range here, from the almost childlike whispher of ""are you hungry, my sad children?"" to belting out the chorus with it's many variations. While this album seems a lot more grown up than Silence, Tara's music itself hasn't radically shifted. Rather, there's more depth, more humor, and more soul searching going on here. It is all lovingly crafted and ready for you to enjoy."
3,just a few small problems,"Overall, a good effort. The instrumentation is as lush as the best Sarah McLachlan albums, altough lyrically the songs come out like something Jewel would write. My only major complaint is the over-use of synthesized beats. The addition of more live drums would have helped tremendously. Some more acoustic guitar would have also been nice.Tara's voice is very gentle and sincere, a feeling that dominates the overall sound. A great album for just sitting back and relaxing."
4,Sarah Mclachlan's fan should enjoy this,"First, I am bias towards Sarah Mclachlan(haven't found anyone elses music measuring up to her). Tara Maclean's singing style is partly similar with Sarah, but her pitches and tunes doesn't shift like Sarah does, which is good in its own way.The song which I enjoy most is ""poor boy"", its got a jazz groof thing going with heavy base. However, I just realized that the singing style of this song is particularly similar to Sarahs ""Dear God""(sarah's cd B-side rarity). If you are a Sarah Maclachlan fan and want to give Tara a try, start with song #9 ""poor boy""."
3,"This isn't ""Silence""...","After waiting years for Tara's follow-up to ""Silence (her STUNNING debut cd), I was extremely disappointed after hearing ""Passenger"". It isn't that ""Passenger"" is bad, it's just mediocre to say the least. While it certainly has it's fair share of memorable songs (the opening track ""Jericho"" & ""Dry Land"" come to mind) & some passable, pretty ballads like ""Settling"", most of the songs on ""Passenger"" don't move me in any way, shape or form. Coming from another artist, ""Passenger"" would make a suitable debut. But after hearing her capability for brilliance (buy ""Silence"" & hear for yourself), I can only think that this is an artist losing her vision to a record label (Nettwerk) that wasn't satisfied with her original slate of songs. As for what could have been, hopefully we'll hear that on her next release."
4,Moody..enjoyable read!,"Although this book has some mistakes (I blame the publisher!), I did not let it sway my opinion. I had a good time reading this book and I am very anxious to see where Christopher Dwyer will write in the future."
1,New Author Chris Dwyer Doesn't Deliver,"I'm a fan of horror movies and i'm always searching for new books in the horror catgory. I found this book and it seemed interesting so i ordered it. i couldn't wait for its arrival and once i got it, i immediately started reading it. Much to my surprise i actually began to regret ever spending my allowance on the book. The grammatical mistakes made it a difficult read not to mention the plot loopholes, and over-developed stereotypical characters. It sounds forced and like the author is trying to make us stupid for reading it. It doesn't sound like he knows what he's talking about. Here's the first line of the book, read it and form your own opinion on whether or not you would like to spend your money to continue:""It was raining. Big, bombastic drops of water were hitting the window right above his bed."""
2,Yuck!,"You know, I don't think I've ever given a recording 2 stars before. This woman has the most awful voice -- I can't imagine how she got a recording contract. To be honest, she sounds like at one point she might have had an ok voice, but as far as I can tell, this recording was made WELL past her prime. (Or else she had a perfectly dreadful cold.) Her tone quality is raspy, and her technique is unstable. I find it very difficult to listen to the music. I give it two stars because her interpretation is solid, and the pianist is excellent. Not recommended, though."
5,"Great Looking, TOugh Watch","I was really impressed with this watch. It is a great looking watch that has lived up well to its G-Shock name. I work around a lot of machinery and handle a lot of rough materials and this watch still looks brand new.One thing i was worried about when buying this watch was the size of it. I have small wrists and i don't like huge, bulky watches. This one is perfect though, big enough to be tough, but doesn't look huge on me.All of the features of the watch work great, the atomic time keeping is really nice.All in all i really like this watch and would buy it again if given the choice."
1,Nutro Dog Food - Sensitive Stomach,"First of all when you go to the Nutro web site you will find no easy link to customer comments or feedback. Something has changed with this company. My dog has been on this food for 3-4 years now and all of a sudden when we purchased the latest bag/s he has been sick constantly. I FINALLY found an 800 number to call and asked if anything in the food came from China and they said no. However they did say that they ""removed"" a couple of things from the food. Very evasive and scary to me. Somewhere along the line this company has become very shady. Something is up and I would never recommend this dog food to anyone. I don't trust any company that avoids their customers!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Problems with this camera Kodak DC 3400,I use this camera in my line of work...so I probably take more pictures than the average person. It is a good camera...and may be the best for the hobby shooter. There are 2 flaws with this model...first one being the 'battery cover door'. They break easily...especially if you happen to put the batteries in backwards and try to force the door close as my grandkids attempted. The other problem is the 'flash'. I'm not sure if it is the flash strobe or the flash capacitor that goes bad....but either way...the flash stops working. At first it's only a missing flash here and there...then complete failure...which makes me believe it is the capacitor going bad. Other than these 2 problems....they are really tough camera and can take a lot of abuse ( drops of 3 to 4 feet )without any damage other than batteries popping out.
5,Its really great,I own this camera and I'm very pleased with it.It takes beautiful pictures.Down loading is simple.Buy it you will like it!
4,Quick an easy,"Right out of the box this camera is simple to use in automatic mode. Great 8"" X 10"" digital photos! The software loaded up without a hitch. Transfering pictures from camera to PC via my existing Adobe program is great. Be ware this little puppy eats batteries! a couple of days of experimenting and about 36 high resolution images and I had to load up new batteries. I could not see spending for features I would likely not use."
4,good camera,"This is a very good camera, especially for the price. Although the battery life is a little poor, the LCD panel small and the zoom lens weak, it takes very good pictures. It also has some nice features including red eye reduction and white balancing. If you're looking for a mid-priced, easy to use camera, I recommned this one highly."
3,"good camera, but...","It is a good camera, but heavier than most of the digital cameras and not easy to hold...These two problems are small but annoying..."
5,Love this camera!,Check out Chris Crosby's review. We went through almost the exact same experience. This is our first digital camera and we couldn't be happier. The pictures look fabulous. One of them is my wallpaper now.
5,This is a wonderful camera,I bought this camera 3 weeks ago. I just love it. I highly recommend it. It is very user friendly. It doesn't eat batteries like the DC280. I just can't seem to put it down.
5,A Star! Still Shining Bright!,"I've read all the reviews. I'm sorry for those who are ignorant of the wear and tear the human body endures as an instrument. I've yet to see the show but the CD is LIZA! To truly enjoy Liza you must except all that life has contributed towards the LIZA of 1999. I'm glad she doesn't sound as she did 25 years ago. No singer's voice would remain the same. It is ridiculous to expect that it would. Her voice is richer, her style more honest, revealing and personal. I'm thrilled she still has the desire to entertain us. Having listened to the CD, I am very excited to see the show. LIZA - a one of a kind, true 'triple threat'. Thank you Liza!"
4,A Warm Tribute,"Liza Minnelli's father, Vincente, who died in 1986, directed more than 30 Hollywood movies. He is best known for his musicals, many of which starred his wife, Liza's mother, Judy Garland. The two met filming 1944's Meet Me in St. Louis. This tribute to Minnelli's pére, recorded during Liza's one-woman Broadway, includes songs from such Minnelli classics as An American in Paris, Gigi, Kismet and The Band Wagon.Avoiding the show-stopping sentimentality she is known for, Liza is in strong voice here, her singing controlled and convincing on such tunes as ""What Did I Have That I Don't Have?"" ""If I Had You"" and ""I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore."" The show's director, lyricist Fred Ebb, doesn't always rein in his old pal, however, letting her blast away, no histrionics barred, on ""I Got Rhythm."" But with backing by a vigorous swing orchestra, Minnelli gives a warm tribute to Dad -- and Mom."
1,Ouch!,"This album is very scary. I wanted to like it as I love Minnelli through her ""New York, New York"" era (late 70s), but she just doesn't have it anymore. Her voice is gone and the wobble in her vibrato is even more pronounced than it ever was. If albums are awarded five stars due to bad singing and poor enunciation, then this would warrent five plus."
1,So Bad It's Good,"Can it be? Did this slurring, spitting hideous voice once bowl us over in Cabaret? Maybe it's loose dentures? What could be causing these sounds? A combination of sadness and shock, followed by the obvious question: ""How could she let this be released?"" Ultimately, this CD is so shockingly bad, you can't help but laugh . . . and maybe shed a tear for the loss of a great American voice."
4,Fine wine turns to port,"Ive grown to like this,i find it far better than her previous outing at radio city,where her performance was ""woeful"",her voice sounded tinny,and lifeless,her selfindulgent shennanigans with her all girl troupe,seemed to please no one but herself,leaving her so breathless from dancing,she sounded like someone who badly needed to clear there throat,that was far more irritating than the occasional slurs on this,never a great intrepretator of a song,with gained maturity has what she and her mother have in common,both are basically good story tellers,in the past i found it difficult to take her seriously as a singer.I must admit the first time i heard this i was shocked,but a few more times round the turntable and what do you know i am hooked,she has a few loose ends to clear up,i hope she keeps the newly acquired power in her voice,without the obvious medication she seems to be on,even half baked no one does it like this kid."
2,Bad To Worse,"This is not the Liza that once was a powerhouse performer. Her voice is no longer its former self, nor is it good. She slurs her way through most of this CD, embarrassing herself and I am sure, many people who put time into this production. Her vibrato was always excessive, but here it is used to grotesque extremes. To say that Liza is back is a mixed bag of regret and hope. Maybe Next Time."
2,A big disappointment,"I must say i'm glad I purchased this cd. However it is for die-hard fans only. Liza's back from her well known battles with food, booze, & pills and it shows. Her trauma's have taken a toll on her voice, she sounds flat and out of key on most of this album, however if you are a true fan that adds to the charm of this album. The stand outs on this album are ""I Thank You"" and an amusing personal take on ""I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore"" Instead of releasing a cd I think a live dvd or video would have been much better. Like I said for true fans only, if your'e not I don't think you would enjoy this very much. I would recommend Bernadette Peters live album insted, It is truly stunning"
4,Strangely Entertaining.,"The orchestration/arrangements for the songs sound wonderful. There's a suspense element in listening to Liza sing on this cd that I like. She starts singing and you have serious doubts that she'll be able to do what the song requires of her. I recently listened to her singing Teach Me Tonight on her Radio City Music Hall live cd and her performance was bad. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the ballad singing on her recent studio album, Gently. ""I Got Rhythm"", ""Baubles, Bangles and Beads"", and ""What Did I Have I Don't Have Now"" are the best tracks on this cd, all performed as ballads. My point is I think her singing is improving in some ways."
1,Dissapointed.,"Oh come on, what is this? The concept of this album is cool, singin' songs from her father Vincet' movies, the performance of Liza is bad, the band is great. Her voice is weak, she's sh's the words and singin' along with her mother, Judy Garland on The Trolley Song is pathetic. Album is recorded live on December 1999. It was her comeback at Broadway's Palace Theater. Producer is Phil Ramone (Brian Setzer Orch.'s Guitar Slinger and Billy Joel's albums). I'm still sorry I bought this."
4,Minelli sparkles despite the rough edges,"What a delightful tribute to Vincent Minelli -- and who better qualified than his daughter Liza to give it?Clearly Liza's struggles with drugs and health battles have taken their toll on her vocal talents (and her diction), but still it was a delight to listen to this album. I would have LOVED to have been there in person for this show -- the energy and emotion crackled clearly, and you could sense it from the CD.Liza may not be at the top of her game anymore, but she's still at the top of her field. Bravo! And welcome back...."
5,BRILLIANT!,"This CD totally captures the magic of the show at the Palace, as well as shows Liza in wonderful voice as she pays tribute to the music of her father. The music grows and grows and as she begins ""What Did I Have"" you think it can't get any better, and she just continues to knock your socks off. It's sooooo good!"
4,Liza: Keeping the Faith,"Like her legendary mother, Liza continues to fight back through all the turmoil and the headlines and to prove once again that she's still a great performer. Her show at the Palace is smartly tailored for any shortcomings she may possess today as a singer. The repertoire is filled with great memories of the days of Vincente Minnelli at MGM. And like Garland, Liza is not above some denegrating humor--""I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore"" which further endears her to an audience. The songs are first class and performed like a champ who refuses to ever be down for the count."
3,Oh LIZA,"Like her legendary mother, Liza continues to fight back through all the turmoil and the headlines and to prove once again that she's still a great performer. Her show at the Palace is smartly tailored for any shortcomings she may possess today as a singer. The repertoire is filled with great memories of the days of Vincente Minnelli at MGM. And like Garland, Liza is not above some denegrating humor--""I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore"" which further endears her to an audience. The songs are first class and performed like a champ who refuses to ever be down for the count."
3,Multiplex,"A very boring book that looks at films in the 80's and 90's. Basically, he descibes movies and what they apparently mean."
2,Unhappy,"The 3rd time I used this drill for a real project it went snap and the drill bit does not turn anymore. It is out of warranty so now I have to pay to get it fixed. I think I will buy a Milwaukee before I pay half the price to have it repaired. To be fare I was drilling 3/4"" holes in 50 year old concrete 2"" deep and it broke on the 5th one."
1,Failed the first day,"Drill over heated and failed after just 5, 5/32 holes for Tap Con screws. I had to finish the job with my far less expencive Ryobi 18 volt cordless drill."
2,Big Brother trash,Little summer song that emerged from the German Big Brother show and therefore one cannot really enjoy it. Music that is pushed so much in your face ....by a lame TV show...and the marketing is so obvious...
1,NOT A GAME--FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!,This is wrongly listed under PC games. Bought this for my husband intending it to be a simulated fly fishing game as advertised (when I searched fly fishing games this came up as a highly rated video game). No where in the the description does it state this not a game but only a tour guide of fishing rivers in the west. In fact it is not even clear on the jewel case as to what exactly the CD contains. It is not until you open it and load it on the computer that you realize this is not a game but rather a tour book on CD. What s rip off! This CD-ROM is a complete watse of time and computer memory. The only reason this would be of any value would be if one was planning a vacation and intending on fishing these rivers. Too bad I opened this POS 'cause now it can't be returnd. A complete waste of money.
1,It is not a game,It is a review of rivers of the west and how to fish them...old software windows 95 buyer beware!!
1,got taken,This croquet set seems nice until you start to play. The balls are to heavy for the mallets and the mallets are cheap. The mallets splinter and become unusable. I dont recommend purchase.
3,Could pass,The game is real good but the real problem is that it's too short.. I turned the game over within 4 hours!!But I guess we'll wait to see what's coming next from Jackass
3,Jackass...Fun...For A Day!,"I bought this video game yesterday because I am a huge fan of the shows and movies. But I passed the game within 5 hours. I also thought it made no sense to rate a game M for Mature for Language when its all bleeped out. To me, that made no sense. But its a good game, just wait till it hits 19.99 to buy it."
4,so so,its pretty good. beat it in two days or so. some of the stunts are pretty challenging but some are so easy. not much to do after you beat it but so are most games.
4,game is cool,my kids wanted this game cause they like the jack ass shows and this is the only game i could find. took them about a week of playing til the completed all stunts but can still go back and play it again. great value.
4,"Interesting, but not really a Home Companion","This was an entertaining little (literally) book full of anecdotes about writers and publishing. It leans heavily towards the 19th and early 20th century.I certainly didn't find it inspirational or useful as a writer, but I did find it amusing.If you like short anecdotes about the writing world you might find it worthwhile dusting through the shelves for a copy at a decent used bookstore."
1,Disappointed,I never received it. I sent a email asking what was going and never responded. I was very disappointed this is the first time that happened to me. I would urge you not to buy from this seller.
3,Merriam-Webster Dictionary,"I think this is just about one of the most comprehensive little dictionaries I've seen. For the price and the fact that it is compact, it is a great buy. I bought 20 for my 7th and 8th graders and they have been worth every penny! My only complaint is that the ink comes off on their fingers, just like newsprint. Their fingers are black after using them. Hope this is just temporary due to the fact that they are new."
2,Just Adequate Dictionary,"The type is too small, the quality of the print poor and the pages and cover are neither well nor consistently centered. I prefer a dictionary that provides at least a brief etymology, which helps me remember the definition of a word that is new to me; there are very few entries that provide this important information. During a recent read of PD James that had several words unfamiliar or unknown to me, I was disappointed to find no entry for some and had to go to another dictionary (a Webster's Collegiate fifth edition from 1941) to find the words. Certainly better than nothing for quick ""look-ups"", but not more than that."
1,Merium Webster Dictionary,"I was disapointed in the too fine print. Hard to read tho compact. Otherwise, OK I guess."
3,Need's more words and definitions and less fluff,"There are many pages in this dictionary that aren't necessary. There are sections such as ""geographical names"", ""biographical names"", and ""foreign words and phrases"", that I would never need to reference. I use this dictionary to refer to whilst I'm reading. Currently, I've had about a 50% chance of finding the word I am looking to define. I think those (in my opinion) filler pages should be replaced with more words and definitions. I realize this is not a ""complete"" dictionary however, I thought my chances of finding a word I need defined would be better than this."
3,I pondered whether to give this two or three stars,"It has words. They are spelled correctly. Definitions. The reason I rated this lower is because of the print job. Some pages are dark, some pages can barely be read. It seemed like the ink refill was an afterthought."
1,"Lost,destroyed with no feedback","At first package did not arrive. Sent message to seller several times with NO response.Eventually package arrived with stampiing from post office ""Received in damaged condition"". Book in torn condition. Still no response from seller.Makes me reconsider any future purchases like this."
4,Great dictionary,"How neat is this; I'm reviewing a dictionary!Anyway, this dictionary is a must-have for all households...Whether to improve your vocabulary, or to look something up...The possibilities are endless! It's very nice looking up words the old-fashioned way rather than searching it online, and sometimes it's nice just browsing through it.This is great for children."
3,Dictionaries for Jail Use,Good dictionary for the price. Still plenty of words not in there that we were looking for. Guess we'll have to upgrade for the hard words.
4,Great classroom dictionary!,"This is a great dictionary to use in the classroom, especially with Adult Education students. It is easy to read (although the type may be a little small) and it is a handy size. It has enough entries to be thorough but not overwhelming for students being introduced to dictionary exercises. Plus, the cost is right if you are on a limited budget."
1,MW Dictionary,We did not find this adequate to our needs. Many words whose definitions I was interested in were not listed.
4,The Merriam-Webster English Dictionary,"My old Webster's Dictionary paperback was in 4 pieces and at least 20 years old, so I decided it was time to replace it with a new one. Wow! The new one is a lot bigger with new words. But, the print is so small it's hard to read. That was a disappointment."
5,Good product,"I bought the soft cover, which costs much less than the hard cover. Great for high school and college students. But, for really esoteric words, I need the unabridge mother of dictionary. Of course, you only need that if you are taking GRE or some graduate level stupid English test that uses words normal people don't care about. In this day and age, I think we (and our children) should spend time learning about technology, instead of archaic vocabs."
5,A DICTIONARY,WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A DICTIONARY OTHER THAN IT HAS CURRENT WORDS A BIT HARD TO READ PRINT IS SMALL BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FOR A PAPERBACK.
3,Not Remastered as stated,"This movie supports an all star cast and a its different kind of western to be sure. The acting, production, and directing is very good.The only problem I had with this movie is it is NOT REMASTERED. The movie has a dark tint through out and is also grainy. If it was truely remastered, I would have give it a 5 star rate......If you like westerns with a different twist,its worth having if you can get for the right price......support your favorite artists........."
2,Not a solid lined kit,I bought this kit because it offers a stencil for a solid lined court where so many others are dashed lines. The picture is not accurate. It is the dashed lined kit.
2,B-ball Court Marking Kit,The kit came w/out any instructions. And the three point line is not obvious. I was disappointed w/ the lack of info available both before and after purchase.
1,Short Life Irreplacable Bulb,"Similar experience to other reviewer... except I was dumb enough to buy a replacement (at the local zoo) and have the same experience.The first clue was that it is very difficult to get to the bulb. Then, it uses a strange halo type bulb that has 2 screws fastening it. After removing the screws, the bulb... with bare wires and resistors comes out. There is not any sort of base that screws, pops, nor any other sort of attachment methods.My son loves it and wants it on while he sleeps, but only lasting a couple months, it's just not worth it to me."
2,Aquarium Seabed Motion Fish Lamp Night Light,Looks OK but makes too much noise as it rotates and the noise ruins the whole effect.
2,Fish night light,The seller was quick - thanks. However the product is very loud - not like the one that my nephew has. The colors are bright & my daughter likes it. The only negative is that it's very loud. I'm disapointed in that
3,A good collection but not the real thing,"This is a pretty good collection of Cheap Trick but really this isn't a band that satisfies with a greatest hits collection. I think you'd do better to decide which of their hits you like and buy the albums from that era. It's the hidden gems on the albums that you'll be listening to for 20 years.But, if you must, this is a good collection."
3,NOT REALLY THAT ESSENTIAL!!!,"Don't get me wrong--most of the music here is great. I'm just disappointed that several chart hits are missing. It's not like there wasn't enough room! And where is ""Up The Creek""? Will that ever see the light of day on a Cheap Trick disc? If you already have their two other greatest hits cds, what's the incentive to shell out for this one? Yes, I understand the first disc of this set concentrates on their 70s heyday, but most fans probably have the first 4 or 5 albums on cd anyway! If this set had included all the chart hits, key album cuts & some nice rarities, I would've bought it without hesitation. Unfortunately, this collection doesn't quite live up to its title."
4,Still good after all these years....,"I've had this album on CD for years. I was really happy to see it in MP3. Kind of an obscure album, but it continues to grow on me. This music is different from anything else I have and the songs are definitely one of a kind. Blue Maroon is still my favorite. Check this out if you want something fresh and different."
2,Disjointed story Line,This story had elements that could have made it a great message. The actors were first rate but the premise of a boy angel was beyond belief. The story line was sometimes slow and plodding and it did not flow smoothly. I could not recommend it as worth buying.
3,I a Gabriel,"good family movie, a little slow at first, but all & all it was a moving experience. Let's you know that there are angels watching over us."
4,Great Movie!,"As a movie it was fantastic, as a fairy tale it was even better than fantastic. Its got heartfelt drama, teary eyed moments, and some good casting, especially with Gabe and the DOC (JOhn Schnieder). If I was missing 20 or 30 IQ points, didnt have the blessing of being able to think for myself, and could get over the overt silliness of reliogen in general this movie would probably be life altering.. If your a christian, or have any faith in god whatsoever, this movie will melt your heart and send you straight to the prayer pats to solve the problems you face, sadly the following day, the following year, and all the years after the problems will still be there unless you fix them yourselves. So enjoy the movie, but dont take it literally.."
5,I Am Gabriel,Awesome movie! We loved it. It is nice to see a movie displaying Christian values that is well done and where the acting is worthwhile.
3,Nice,"If you are looking for a nice religious movie for a family night, this one is a good one to use. It does involve death and looks at addictions, so some people may not wish their younger children to watch it. I enjoyed the movie, but the acting was second rate. It's not a best seller, but the idea behind it was nice. I would recommend for pre-teens and above. It did get a little cheesy near the end, but the ending worked well enough to overlook that small part."
5,Very Pleased,"Well made, fit well, and don't look too ""western"" for those men who are frustrated by the limited choices of boots available."
5,These boots were made for walking,"The ""roper"" boots arrived promptly and were exactly as listed. They are well build and very comfortable as well as attractive.James Lyons"
3,"Disappointed, but will probably keep them anyway","I was a little more than disappointed to see ""Made In China"" in these boots (I was led to believe that Justin were all Made in the USA, and that's part of the reason I bought these). In that respect, the product info was misleading.Also; the felt lining in the heel area only lasted a few wearings before it tore and bunched up, so I can't walk very far without feeling like I've got a blister coming on. The black rubber sole just seems cheap, and they feel off-balance (compared to other boots that I own) when I'm walking in them.Overall, I'm disappointed with the manufacturing and quality, but will probably still keep them since I sit at a desk most of the time.If you're going to work or walk in these boots, I don't recommend them."
5,Boot scooting,"This is a nice Justin Roper boot. The boot does not come with a liner, so you need to put one in. Actually this is a nice option so you can decide if you want to put in a thicker one."
4,What you see is what you get,"There is nothing fancy about this cross. It's thicker than what it looks. It is a standard porcelain cross for a child's room. packaging was a little beat up, but the cross itself was in good condition."
2,flimsy jacket zipper,Zipper on the jacket pulls apart if not secured properly. You have to take the time to make sure its connected or it pulls apart. The zipper is too small for the jacket.
1,"DeWalt DW4990 7"" Super Flex Quick Change","The DeWalt DW4990 7"" Super Flex Quick Change rubber backing pad, madein Taiwan, arrived in a sealed box, without the ""One Clamp Washer.""Two items are listed on DeWalt's ""Packing List"", ""One FlexibleBacking Pad"" and ""One Clamp Washer.""DeWalt DW4990 7-Inch Super Flex Quick Change Rubber Backing PadAre incomplete contents common with the DeWalt brand?"
4,a must have,"If you have the Dewalt angle grinder this is a must have! It doubles the versatility of your grinder to allow for sanding applications. And like all DeWalt tools and accessories, its well designed and manufactured."
5,Love this material!,I had a fleece sleepsack and found that my baby got too warm in it... so I found this material and find it to be more breathable and very soft! I would purchase this again over the fleece!! Love the sleepsacks!!
4,Great material,I loved how this blanket felt (and so did my son) but just wished it came in the early-walker style.
5,Warm with a nice lining,"I did not realize this Sleepsack would have a jersey lining, but the outside is soft velboa and it has a soft, t-shirt like lining on the inside of the Sleepsack. I also like the green color. This Sleepsack is much cozier than the fleece version, and I also like the fleece version!"
2,Very thin!,"I ordered this thinking it would be warm - the picture made it look plush, plus it said it had two layers. The inner layer, cotton, is so thin I can see through it. Even with two layers, its not as thick as the fleece sleepsacks. Would definitely not purchase again. If I had seen it in a store I would not have bought it."
4,When you can no longer swaddle...,"... these are the best. For the first 3 months of my child's life she was swaddled at sleep time. Once she got strong enough to either kick or maneuver her way out of the swaddle I started using these Halo Sleepsacks. Due to keeping a pretty cool house, I was concerned that the sleepsack would not be warm enough for her, but they are fine. Sometimes,she even perspires in them. The Halo Sleepsack is a fantastic alternative to piling on a bunch of blankets, especially since blankets at young ages can be unsafe (accidental suffocation).The only down side (my opinion) is the fleece material. Not crazy about fleece because it pills and looses some of it's original softness, but these are still worth it. As my daughter grows, I will continue to buy larger sizes until she can no longer fit into them."
5,Good read for fans,A great follow up to the trilogy! Gives background and ties up some story lines that had been left open over the four stories it contains. My favorite being the second.
3,Won't Win Any New Readers,"I enjoyed Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy. I honestly did. And I liked these little stories, especially the one about Lucivar. But if you haven't read her work before, I would not recommend picking this up. It's little more than relaxing, enjoyable fluff meant for folks who are already fans of the series. These are the stories that fans write fiction about because they desire so much to see them. They aren't astounding literature...just good old, kick back, put your heels up, and munch on chocolate fluff stories."
4,Loved the Trilogy,"I really loved the Black Jewels Trilogy and was anxious to read Dreams Made Flesh, the follow up. It's interesting that the book is separated into parts. The first taking place after Heir to the Shadows, the second taking place before all three parts of the trilogy, and the last taking place after all three. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because I just did not like the way the last story in the book (Kaleer's Heart) took place. I would have liked Janelle's story to end much differently. I feel that she really should have retained all her power. I just don't like that she was less than she was when we first began reading of her journey."
3,Mother Night,"I waited with bated breath for Ms. Bishop's next installment to the Black Jewels realm. I kept it on my shelf as I re-read the trilogy before diving into the new book. I enjoyed the different stories for the most part. I liked Lucivar and Marian's courtship and the story of Saetan's past revealing his Warlord nature and power. The continuation of Daemon and Janelle's life was disappointing to me. Yes, it gave some closure to The Queen of the Darkness, but it lacked the potency and creativity I have come to expect from Ms. Bishop's writing...especially in these stories.I would of course be interested in reading anything else she decides to write in this realm. I actually would love to see a story about the creation of the Dragons and how they came to be and how they decide what witch or prince gets their birthright jewel, what the offering to the Darkness entails...just a thought.All in all, Dreams Made Flesh is entertaining and worth the read."
5,Another brilliant masterpiece,"I fell in love with The Black Jewels Trilogy years ago, and I just stumbled across this gem. This book is every bit as good as the original trilogy, and provides some more background that was formerly missing, along with resolving that which the trilogy left hanging. I started reading it today and I couldn't put it down until I was finished, and now I want more. Brilliantly written, with depth and feeling to every character, this book draws you in and won't let you go until it's over. I *highly* recommend it. Of course, if you haven't read the original Black Jewels Trilogy, you need to do that first, or you won't understand what's going on."
2,dreams made flesh,"I just read the trilogy for the first time and loved it, so I moved on to Dreams Made Flesh. I feel like a different person wrote this book. I found it to be very childish. Many things didn't fit with the original story. I should say I am mainly talking about Kaeleer's Heart, I liked the first three stories pretty well but the last one that I was so looking forward to was like a young teen read the original Trilogy and this was the ending she put to it. I really think it stunk. Sorry!"
5,LOVE IT!!!!,This is the next amazing installment of the Black Jewels series that neatly ties in storylines from the previous books and provides a more in depth look and our favourite characters. Couldn`t put it down!
4,fitting conclusion,"This book wraps up the series and answers a lot of questions left unanswered from the series, worth reading."
5,Fantastic Follow-Up!,"I just love this book! It certainly is the only collection of short stories that I have heartily enjoyed this much! And though I didn't read it in one sitting as I did the first time I read it, it certainly has made me VERY excited to read the brand new book by this terrific author!I am going to try to savor this new one, but I'm sure I'll be too excited to read it slowly - just like all the others in the series.Really it is just a wonderful book. Bishop created a wonderful world and peopled it with truly remarkable characters!"
4,ties up loose ends,Love this series! This has stories that help add to our knowledge of what formed the charactors in the Black Jewels trilogyI am waiting for the next in the series#7.Don't miss #6 either.Anne Bishop keeps the action going and never fails to please!I have everything she has written
5,Original and one of a kind,"This book contains three different stories. The first story explains how Daemonar and Marian, (Lucivar's son and wife) were involved in his life and their appearance in the Main First three books.The second story reveals more about Saetan and his past which is interesting. It also reveals what Zuulumaan is and why he refused to tell his son, Lucivar, telling him to ask Andulvar. Zuulumaan helps fill in the gap in which Lucivar asks for the story of Zuulumaan in exchange for helping Karla through her virgin night.Then the last story explains the aftermath of the war and it just beautifully written. The love between Jaenelle and Daemon becomes more and more intersting.I loved it and I'm a fan of the Black Jewels. If you want more, then this is a good book to read after the first three."
5,ADD + Drugs = Why?,"I read this book while I was in jail for possesion of cocaine with the intent to deliver. Although I had read books previously that alluded to a relationship between ADD type disorders and self medication with various street drugs as well as alcohol and perscripton drugs (whatever one can get be it benzodiazapines, opiates, etc.), this book defines that causal relationship in a very extensively and clinically yet logically and understandable at the same time. The book allowed me to gain insight both in my own use/abuse patterns and the patterns in the people around me. As a veteren coke dealer of ten years (before being caught), I saw a lot of patterns and I can now attribute a great majority of these addictive and compulsive behaviors to underlying clinical problems that can be dealt with on a level that is astigmatic and non-dehumanizing."
5,Great Product - My Second One,I bought the exact framing nailer a year ago and loved it. This year I bought one for a relative because I liked mine so much.
5,Good value for the money,"Works great so far. I've only run about 500 nails through it(I'm remodeling my house one room at a time), but so far no problems. Great tool for the money, and my arm and shoulder thank me for it."
3,Lacking compared to others,"I tried this nailer, the Bostitch F21PL and RIDGID's framing nailer. This one had trouble driving 3"" nails into 2x4s unless I had the depth adjustment dialed all the way in. There's also a lot of ""play"" in the nose and not much grip to the teeth, making toe-nailing difficult. It would help if they just bent out the teeth a bit (like the RIDGID and Bostitch). It was a very tough choice, the Porter Cable would have be my second choice over the RIDGID (the Bostitch was leaking from the handle out of the box). Other features lacking that sent me to another nailer were lack of a hangar hook (nothing major me, but still a point loss) and that it can't be adjusted to accommodate other nail sizes."
4,Pretty good,So far I like this nail gun. The biggest strike against it that I've found is the difficulty in finding the appropriate nails for it - at least without buying a huge quantity.
5,Great Framing Nailer,"Just finished house number 2 with this bad boy. You just can't beat Porter Cable. Stick with the 350A instead of buying the 350mag. It is only about a pound heavier, comes with a case and you save $40.Very Well Balanced Machine, little fatigue during the day. Great hands-free depth adjustment. Extremely easy to load, advance and clear. You can change from restrictive to sequential fire easily on the trigger.My Hitachi can now be retired, I will not go back, this is my framing nailer of choice. As another reviewer seems to have found out, this is not an appearance nailer, for something like siding you may want to try the Porter-Cable RN175A Coil. I have had no problems sinking 16D's in even engineered lumber. For everyday use the 350A is highly recommended."
2,Rough Framing isn't for everyone,"Rough Framing is not for everyone or every nailer. We had three of these porter cable nailer because of the price on a framing crew. As time went on we had one nailer on the job because two were always in the shop. The guns do not have the duribility needed to stand up to driving a few thousand nails a day. We oil the guns every day and keep the compressor at 110 but still had problems. The guns jam at least twice a day and there is no easy way to fix them while hanging off the side of a house. I've used Dewalt, Hitachi, Bostich, and a few other and never had to wonder if they would fire each time I pulled the trigger. It is also tricky to change out a clip of nails once they are loaded.The tool free adjustable muzzle and depth are nice features. I wish that the nailers were put together better. We chose to go to Hitachi and get a nailer worth the money."
5,great nail gun,"i have had this porter cable framing nailer for about a month i have used it out on my deck, with 2 and 3/8 hot dipped galvanized ring shank round head nails this gun put them in flush right out of the case. love this nailer no problems what so ever, easy to load , easy to oil, easy to unload, no jams, i will be using this nailer on my waterfront dock that got heavily damaged in a northeaster last november in chincoteague island virginia, i have great faith in this porter cable framing nailer, i also liked amazons great price and free shipping."
4,Great Gun!,"My only complaint so far is the rubber tip, which does not stay in place very well. This gun has no problem driving 3.5"" nails. Don't believe the previous reviewer who had problems with 3"" nails. His compressor says Fisher-Price."
3,Hard to find nails for it,Where can you find nail for it. Call the manufacturer rep. there is very few or none retailers carry their nails.
2,Nice gun but a major flaw,"I recently purchased this gun and ran into something very frustrating. As you get close to the end of a strip of nails (about 10 or so left), the gun misfires and it doesn't allow you to run out the clip. I need to get a new clip of nails and basically throw away the unused nails from the previous clip. I'm actually returning the gun because of the wasted nails I keep throwing away."
5,Basement and Shed Framing,"This is my first nailer, and I don't see the need to ever get another one. I've used this to frame my unfinished basement and construct a foundation for my composite shed made by lifetime. This nailer works great, and I'm thoroughly satisfied with this purchase. Also if your looking for nails you cant beat amazon esp. with the free shipping."
3,Framing Nailer,"Product was delivered promptly, but at 120lbs pressure it does not set the nails all the way. It's like the framer loses some of the pressure."
5,Porter-Cable FR350A Round Head 2-Inch to 3-1/2-Inch Framing Nailer,"Item as described, fast shipping, haven't had time to use it yet but will be helpful in future projects."
1,Porter Cable?,"Surely Porter Cable did NOT make this! Brand NEW out of the box and it would not drive 3"" nails? Bought mine on sale at Home Depot and fortunately they allowed me to return it. I have used nailers over 15 years and could not believe this. Shame on you Porter Cable for advertising this gun will shoot 3 1/2"" nails and it would NOT drive 3"" nails. This is not the Porter Cable I used to know. Buyer beware, this gun is not as advertised. The telling end was my offer to the store manager was that I would buy 2 if he could get it or another new one out of the box to drive 3"" nails. He would not accept the offer, stating some things may be over stated on their (Porter Cable)labels. My prayer is that potential buyers read this BEFORE purchase and someone, anyone from PC also read this...shame on you PC"
3,NAIL GUN,I DID NOT WANT THIS ITEM. I WAS NEVER ASKED TO CONFIRM MY ORDER I WILL NEVER USE AMAZON AGAIN. I HAD TO PAY SHIPPING BOTH WAYS ON THIS ORDER. I TRIED TO STOP IT BUT IT WAS TO LATE. AMAZON HAS A VERY POOR SYSTEM I WANT MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER REMOVED AT ONCE
4,Really good framing nailer!!!,"I can't say anything bad about this nailer, I use one just like it at work all the time, It's a real labor saver, and it's never given us any trouble, I would recomend this tool to anyone for any framing duties......Brownsboro, TX."
5,Great product,This nail gun is so durable and easy to use. I own other Porter Cable product and they are all the same when it comes to being quality products. I would recommend.
5,A Great Game,"I am a major horse racing fan, and this game captures all the aspects of owning, racing, breeding, and riding than any other game i've ever owned or played.( you can almost feel the horse underneath you!!!)"
5,Easier than you think!,"After reading the reviews here, I thought this game would be impossible to master, expecialy since I don't know the first thing about horse racing. Yet after an hour I was winning nearly every race and became one of the top jockeys in the game! It is challenging enough, but not too easy either, unlike Gallop Racer which was fairly easy. The people do talk alot but it is kinda nice because you get to choose what to say back and they give you tips. I only wish you could own horses, other than that, this game is pretty much perfect:D"
5,Best Game By Far,"This game is awsome!!! You are the jockey, and its amazing! Everyone should own this game because its so far out!!!"
1,BS by Amazon,I ordered four of these at a very good price. Amazon said the order was good. I get an email later that said the order was cancelled because Wesco tools was out of stock. However I could still buy it at a price increase of 4 times the original amount. It is such bad business because it was in stock at a deal but they really don't have it and can't get it at that price. Anybody has a good price when they don't have.
3,CP die grinders,"i have been useing CP die grinders for over 20 years and like them very well, but the grinder in the pic is not the one i receaved. the one i got is a right angle grinder."
4,Teton Sports Outfitter XXL,"Was very happy with the over all product. Only gave it 4 stars as it was a little difficult to get together and took 2. But otherwise, very happy!"
1,Middle legs buckled and broke pretty quickly,"I bought this cot because description said it could support 600 pounds. I am a fat woman, but I am under 600 pounds. More than 300 pounds under. Middle legs bent and broke and collapsed while I was lying pretty still watching dvds. Scared the bejesus out of me and left me with a big, useless piece of fabric and cheap, bent metal."
2,Get a J-Life Japanese Traditional Shiki Futon or Shikibuton Trifold Foam Beds,XXL Cot is too high and heavy. It broke on the 2nd day after I laid down on it. A screw broke off and I returned it. The replacement came and I had to return it as well because there was rust build up near some screws.Cots are meant to be temporary and overtime it will sag in the middle so get a shiki futon and shikibuton trifold foam bed. It has more back support.
3,"What's with the Box, TETON?","The bed came in a box that was previously opened by somebody else and then taped over. So, obviously, I was suspicious about the bed in that box. The bed seemed to be OK. But WHAT IS UP WITH THE BOX, TETON? WHY SUCH A SLOPPY JOB???? Where has that bed been before it came to me? I will never know....."
5,Great extra bed,The bed arrived really fast. Used as a guest bed and brother-in-law liked it. He's about 6' tall and about 185 lbs. He said it felt more like a hammock vs. a cot. He said it was comfortable and felt sturdy. The bed took alot of space in the small bedroom but it worked out just fine. It was also easy to assemple and can be stored in a closet.
4,Good size,"Bought this along with TETON Camp cot to use in another room when the spouse snores too loud. While I'm not a fan of the cot, this has great support. It's a good size, I'm 5'5"" and when I'm on it there is plenty of room for the cat to sleep at either end without me worrying about kicking it. I have some back problems and can't do a lot with heavy things but I had no problem setting this up by myself. Closing it back up did require some assistance. It also comes with a handy and sturdy storage bag with straps for easy carrying. When the cot is on it, there is minimal sagging. Really liked it."
4,"Big cot, does the job","As some others have said, its big. I think the trickiest thing is figuring out how to set it up in your tent. I have a 6 person tent and certainly do this before anything else. I get a bit worried that the feet might put a hole in the tent, but so far so good. Using your hammer handle is a huge important trick in putting it together!!! Check that out on you tube - I spent at least 30 minutes trying to make thing last thing go in before I turned to you tube and in 2 seconds the trick worked and the cot was put together.Now why not 5 stars? Its HARD. If you like a hard mattress, you will be thrilled. If you like a soft mattress (side sleepers, etc), it is much too hard. I did get the expensive pad to go with it, but it didn't help much and that weekend I didn't sleep great, (I'll keep it around for house guests that like harder beds). I ended up getting a $25 air mattress for on top of the cot, and I now sleep like a baby."
4,better than anything else ive seen,I am currently stationed at a very rural base in Afghanistan and we don't have any beds. I ordered this cot because the cots we have have seen better days. The cot arrived in a little over a week (not sure how they got it here that fast) and once it made it boy was i in for a treat. This cot is huge!!! It's twice as wide as a regular army cot so you can really spread out. The cot doesn't sag in the middle like most do and not that it matters but its pretty sporty looking. The only down fall is it is very heavy. I think it weighs about 25 pounds or so. The weight isn't that a big of a deal if you don't plan on carrying it anywhere. Overall one great product from one greatful grunt!!! thanks
1,Arrived Defective,"I was disappointed to receive this cot with two defects. Nuts were missing from three bolts and a rivet holding a rubber bumper in place snapped off when I first sat on the cot. I am returning it to Amazon unused and plan to try another brand. I would try a replacement but I don't have confidence in the rivets used throughout this product and missing hardware is indicative of sloppy manufacturing processes.The cot is very large and the fabric seems very tough. One word of caution, the chemical smell from the new fabric is very strong. Plan to set it up and let it air out a few days before you use it."
2,Tarp wasn't long enough,"I was so glad to have found this cot. BUT when it arrived I unpacked it and put it together - or rather tried to but couldn't the unfolding was easy, and it wasn't hard to get it ready to finish up the job but the tarp was too short to allow the head and foot bars to be secured.I had 2 people try to stretch that tarp to fit into place and it would not - it was just cut too short. The worst was that it was already a return. I could tell that someone else had tried to get the bars in place and to stretch the tarp to fit as there were cuts and scrapes in the metal exactly where t you have to fit the bars into the frame's slots.I saw this when I was first looking at it but thought at first it was because the product didn't come wrapped and the metal bars were just held together with a rubber band. But the extra tape at one end should have alerted me that someone had retaped the box. Just like I had too when I returned the item. Too bad because it looked like an awesome product."
2,Good for using once in a while...,"When our parents were visiting us for an extended period of time, I decided to get this cot for daily use for some months. After using it every night for one week, the cot remained firm but at the end of the second week it started sagging - my weight is around 72 kgs. Also, I had to lay on my back or else my hands would go numb from sleeping on my sides. Your body remains in a C shaped posture when you sleep on this cot. At the end of third week I started getting back and neck pain. I returned it back.This cot is meant for outdoor use and that implies using it once in a while (?). If you would use this once in a while, probably you'll like it."
3,"large size, but care must be taken or it can bend or warp.","The size of the top is great, but found that despite the claim it can sustain total 600 lbs, you must be careful not to sit on the edge of the frame or it can bend. The plastic covers/caps on the feet bottoms split open on the first day of use exposing the sharp metal edges. The material feels a bit thin and I get the feeling I could easily go through it if not careful. I would not use it except for short periods... like camping or an overnight occasional guest. Using a wood broom handle as a lever I was able to stretch the frame more easily to assemble it. It needs some engineering improvements to eliminate these problems."
5,Five more stars.,"I slept on one of these every night for three years, then gave it away and bought another one. After three years of my 220 pounds, it did begin to sag. As it sagged it became more comfortable. The young lady I gave it to likes it saggy because she thinks it's like a hammock.At first it's tough to stretch to put together, but once together is solid, durable and comfortable. Folded it's portable and relatively light, for such a substantial bed.Used the newer one for about six months, but now sleep in a real bed. But that XXL is in the guest room closet waiting for any guest's kids that might want to sleep in the basement or the back yard.This is an extraordinary piece of equipment."
4,Nice sturdy cot,"I like that this is comparably priced to an Aerobed, which I've purchased before, and loved, until it lasted less than 2 years--even with extremely gentle treatment!!!This cot is sturdy, stable, easy to fold and unfold, very comfortable to sleep on. A good night's sleep anywhere! It's supposed to be good up to 600 lbs. My 75 lb. daughter uses it during summer visits, and it does dip in the middle a bit. And you definitely need additional padding. It won't pop! For us it works out very well."
4,Great big cot!,This is an excellent product. I bought this size to use it with a twin-sized air mattress. Fits nicely and provides great camping experience. Only issue is the length of the cot which dictates a large tent (greater than 10 ft) to hold it. Height provides plenty of storage space underneath.
3,Good strong comfortable cot,"I bnought one of these five years ago and got a lot of use out of it. My nephews were jumping up and down on it and were jumping on it from a chair (which I did NOT know at the time) well that broke it. I bought a new one to replace it and can say this new model seems to be more solid, the fabric is tighter and more supportive and comfrotable as heck. As one other reviewer noted, it doesn't breathe so it does collect moisture during the night, and if you are using the matching pad that thing gets soaked. Except for that this would be a five star product. I mean who wants to wait two hours the morning of departure for your pad and cot to dry. Come on guys, get this figured out."
2,Lasted 3 years,"I weigh a lot, so I bought this cot for it's size and 600 pound weight limit so I could camp at bluegrass festivals. I bought it in Sept 2008 and one night this Sept.(2011) it seemed to be sagging in the middle. I grabbed a flashlight to look and found one of the middle legs bent. It bummed me out! I had come to believe it was virtually indestructible. I've slept on this thing for up to 8 or 9 nights at a time. I'm disappointed. I was hoping it would last longer than it did. Guess I'll have to make some kind of support for it."
1,"Weight Capacity Rating is Misleading, COT Fails","I was impressed with its seeming sturdyness and construction at first when I received this cot. I purchased it as a result of its weight capacity of up to 600 pounds. I am 450 pounds and after an initial test, which it passed with no problem, and then one whole night of sleep it failed on the second night of usage.Let me be clear that all I did with this was lay on it and while sleeping shift my body position as any normal person does during the night. The middle leg on the bed collapsed. I originally recomended this item, but now I give it a 1 of 5 stars since it would have likely failed with a person of average weight after a longer period of time."
2,Expensive price for what looks like used cot ?,"My box arrived in smashed condition with what looked like a home tape job with tons of masking tape over a clearly opened box. Furthermore it arrived sent from a ""returns"" center. Two of the poles were very dirty and blackened almost as if the had been left near a campfire too long. Disappointing to say the least about paying for a new cot ( >$100 ) and getting what looks to be either an open box item or a flat out used return. Not the best AMAZON. BUYER BEWARE."
1,Most Disappointing,"I bought this camp bed and have been extremely disappointed with it. The stabilizing bars at either end are hard to attach and the center leg has buckled after only the third use. With the buckling of the center leg, the joint in the center has begun to collapse as well. I'm not a small woman, but the weight load is supposedly 600 pounds! It doesn't bear anything near that obviously. The frame is cheap and not worth the money. Because I used it twice last summer and once this summer (meaning it has been over a year), I can't return it for replacement.Don't buy this cot!!!!!!"
3,strong well build BUT! consider this first !,"i read every review on amazon i had to say these facts are correct once i recieved this cot1. you going to need a thick pad on top ..pressure points will allow you to sleep few hours ..then its unbearible!2. 2 weeks still smells like chemicals my cat wont evey go in the room , its bad3. very high off the ground , depending on your tent you may have a issue with the angle of your tent walls4. the shipping box was badly damaged the problem seems to be the cot is smaller than the box moves around or just sum anger by the shippers hehehe?.....oh my god !"
1,Not what I expected weight capacity is not correct!!!,I lent this to my friend who weighs 265lbs and after one night of camping two legs bent and broke. Maybe the canvas top and stitching can handle the weight they rate this cot at but not the metal frame. I can not in good faith give this cot a good review.
3,I got a big cot!,"It's huge! I bought this because I'm a big dude, and well, it's built pretty stout I still feel Like I exceed the weight limits of it (I'm 275). It just feels stressed. It's noisy when you move around on it creaks and pops. Overall I don't feel like it's gonna collapse, but a small section of the canvas near the corner started to tear, which had to be repaired."
2,Good cot but ridiculously hard to put together.,"I just got this cot, and so far it has been a pain to put together. It even says in the instructions that come with it that it will be very hard to get the last part of the end rail attached. It also says you may need some kind of pry bar to get the last part of the end rail attached.If I can't get this thing together in the next 15 minutes it's going back. Very annoying. Other than that it seems to be well made, but it shouldn't be this hard to put together."
3,Eh. It's OK.,"Withing seconds of unpacking, the drawstring on the included storage sack snapped in two pieces. The string was actually two pieces melted together!? Cheap. The strap on the same bag came un-stitched later that weekend.The cot itself is OK. We also own a ""Military Cot"" from Byer of Maine, which has a better design and build to it,...and is easier to setup.This Teton cot is much larger. That seems to be their niche. If you need the larger size, this would be the way to go."
4,Spacious,"This was a great purchase and is perfect for my screened porch. It is rather difficult to get and keep the end rails in place, but that is supposed to improve with use-the material should stretch."
5,huge!,"These cots are gigantic. I spend most of my nights in a large bed and tend to move around a lot so the size of the cot makes a difference. These are perfect: sturdy and easily put together. They do weigh a lot but if you aren't hiking with them who cares?I also purchased the Teton cot pads for them.UPDATE (A year later)We usually put the cots together and even though we don't spend all night in our own cots, they have held up just fine, save for the rubber feet on the bottom. Several of them have I guess decayed somehow and fallen apart. Be wary of your tent floor being punctured. It's an easy problem to solve with a towel or something, but watch out for it. Experienced cot sleepers can ignore this but for all you bad sleepers out there, I believe the cot pads are necessary. They turned the cot from a miserable nights sleep into a bed away from bed."
3,chemical smell,"Everything is good about the cots except the chemical smell it gives off. Sitting it outside in the sun for days, ozoning it, washing it with baking soda, and washing with vinegar have not been able to eliminate the smell. Other cots we bought from a different manufacturer just needed a couple hours in the sun to eliminate the chemical odors they had."
5,Get this one,"I looked around for quite a while before purchasing this cot. I am 6' 3"" and 315 lbs so I wanted something that I could sleep on without feeling like I was going to hit the ground any second. I bought two of these cots and they are awesome. I can stretch out, feel secure, and get a great nights sleep. They are even surprisingly comfortable. I bet I could sleep two people on this thing in a pinch.Get this cot...you won't regret it!"
5,Great Product,"My son is 6'6"" and 245 lbs. He says this cot is plenty long enough and very comfortable. Easy to unfold and refold to place back into the carrying case that comes with it. Overall he said it's a great product and the framework is sturdy and durable. Would highly recommend it to Amazon customers...particularly the really tall ones!"
3,Canvas Sags -,"I received with torn up box. Opened and all parts there, Assembled and thought it would be hard to pull canvastaught as others have indicated. In my case it was just plain sloppy. It did not look used. No way to makecanvas taught. Returned."
2,BE CAREFUL GETTING OUT,BOUGHT THIS STURDY COT FOR MY TRAILER UP NORTH. SEEM LIKE BUILT VERY STURDY WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED. I AM 220 LBS AND THE FIRST MORNING I GOT UP-SAT UP IN MIDDLE OF COT TO GET OUT AND MIDDLE LEG OF COT BENT OVER AND KINKED---GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A BRACE FOR IT NOW AND HOPE IT WORKS---THE CLOTH MAY BE STURDY BUT THE LEGS ARE NOT----
1,Total crap,"The support material sagged down so far that it touched the frame when I laid on it. The end pieces did not fit snugly and would fall off if the cot was bumped. Just a poorly put together item. With all the other positive reviews, I thought I made the right choice. Maybe this one just slipped past their quality control department somehow... Returning for a different manufacturer."
5,Sturdy cot,"We purchased two of these for camping and are very pleased. This cot is awesome! First of all it's HUGE! Larger than a twin mattress (in fact a twin fitted sheet is too small). Secondly it's very sturdy; I have three young boys and they couldn't wait to bounce/jump/crawl all over it. It appears as though it will take years of abuse (this is good) and won't buckle under pressure. Thirdly, it sets up in no time. Just be sure to secure alternate corners and the rest snaps into place. We are extremely satisfied and can't wait to use it camping..if New Hampshire ever thaws out!"
3,Teton Sports Outfitter XXL Cot,"Good cot. Bought it for the holidays when I don't have enough beds to accommodate all my guests. I have an issue with the legs on the one cot. It is a bit more difficult to close than it should be. I need to take a pliers and make a ""fix"". Very comfortable. The extra width gives the person room to ""toss"" around - not the case with standard-sized cots that I've slept in. The fact that I had to perform a field fix keeps this from attaining a higher rating. I would try LL Bean's XXL cot first next time. The only reason I didn't this time was I got free shipping through Amazon.About six months after I received this cot, the one cot's leg broke on me. I would not recommend this cot. In fact, I replaced the broken one with LL Bean's Maine Military Cot. The LL Bean cot is a MUCH BETTER product!"
5,Great Cot!!!,"I am a retired United States Marine. This cot was extremely easy to use. It assembled in 1 min. 33 sec. from bag. It disassembled in 1 min. 42 sec. back in the bag. I did these times the second time putting it together. The cot sleeps amazingly well. I am 6'4"", 285 lbs. and had room to spare. There is nothing I do not like about this cot. With a little cushion it sleeps better than a bed. I would deffinitely recommend this product to anyone!"
3,Problems with rubber bushings,Overall I really like the cot with the pad for it's comfort. I do not like the design of the rubber bushings at the end of each leg because the end of the leg is angled to match the floor but the rubber bushings are not so if placed on a hard suface the bushing splits. I had three out of six split and called Amazon who handled the complaint quickly. Although I wanted just new bushings they sent a new bed and I returned the original one. I slept on the new bed for one night and one of the bushings split which was predictable since this is a design problem and not a quality issue. If this bed is used in a tent there is a possibilty the legs would tear the tent bottom. The warranty that comes with the bed gives no place to contact at Teton. I will buy pads to put under each foot when I use the bed and use it but the design needs changed.
2,Not what I ordered,"Ordered this product for my home. The description doesn't go into detail about the size, I needed a 20x20x1, so I ordered a case. When I received a case of the product it was a 12x20x1. I contacted the company and they said it would be too much money for them to have the product shipped back to them, so just keep it, and we will refund your money! I HAVE STILL YET TO RECEIVE THE REFUND! I told them... well I am really needing a filter that is 20x20x1, so what am I supposed to do now... they said to reorder!Little skeptical to order and have the same thing happen!"
2,Price is right but sounds like a jet taking off.,I made the mistake of going just for cost when ordering these filters. They do seem to get the job done but are very loud
3,Murray no da esta vez en la diana.,"La gran mezzosoprano ANN MURRAY pasa con suficiencia mas bien ajustada por este recital de arias de operas de Haendel. El timbre es agradable, pero las coloraturas se le resisten por momentos, y recitales de este tipo ya se han grabado muchos y muy buenos, y en este caso, para cantar bien Haendel no basta con tener una voz bonita, hay que tener registro uniforme, y esto le falta aqui a la Murray. Aunque por momentos, en algunas arias, deja su sello de calidad, el resultado es suficiente, pero dentro de una correcta discreccion.Discurren mejor las cosas con el acompañamiento, con LA ORQUESTA DEL SIGLO DE LAS LUCES, eficazmente dirigida por CHARLES MACKERRAS, especialista en la materia, lo que da un sello de interes a este disco, que, insisto una vez mas, no pasa de lo correcto. Y esto, ante obras tan conocidas y grabadas como las aqui presentadas no llega por completo."
2,Scent overkill!,"For people with allergies and asthma, strong smells can trigger an attack. I used this stuff all over the house because ""company was coming."" I wanted everything to look and smell extra clean, and besides -- one of my guests had allergies and asthma.Big mistake! Unlike other sprays I have used, this stuff was outrageously scented, and it didn't seem to fade away to a tolerable level. (I did not go overboard with spraying it around, honestly.) When my guests came, I ended up having to re-wash the blankets and put the couch pillows in the closet.For someone else it might be great, but I'll never use it again."
5,good bit,"I bought these one by one to replace my bosch titanium bits that were slowly wearing out, especially on metals. These cobalts are much better for tough metal. Good stuff."
5,SURPRISING!!!!,"I thought we would try this just out of curiosity really. I actually bought two types of the Alpine Aire Chili to see which we liked best. I also purchased the Mountain Chili. Well I received my order today and the family had a bowl of each. The results were in....I am definately going back for more. We LOVED both of them but were partial to the Black Bart Chili for it had a little more ""kick"" to it. Not overly spicey but a good blend of spices. If you are a chile lover like we are you will not be disappointed! Handy, long shelf life and oh so delicious. I am now going to try some other flavors. Will be so handy to have on hand when you have one of those nights where you just can't face the stove. Try it!!"
2,How Disappointing,"this novel turned out to be.....after watching her work (via Netflicks marketing skill) ""Midsomer Murders"" I thought that she had talent...lets just say it....she is like a female Sidney Sheldon or a Harold Robbins....I will not buy another one of her novels...although I still enjoy the TV series which proves once and for all that between the two there exists some reprieve...."
5,Wonderful songs for family to listen to throughout the day.,"My baby son loves to hear ""Little Sheep"" as he goes to sleep. Of course he's too young to understand the words to the songs, but Diana Lynn's soft instrumentattion and soothing rythmes grab my son's attention every time he hears them played.Diana's website has several videos, as well as the lyrics to her songs. I enjoyed reading the insights that go along with each of the lyric pages. Go see for yourselves www.dianalynnmusic.com ."
2,not very pretty,"I was disappointed in this pitcher. The color of the crystal is bad, for one thing. It has a greyish cast to it that makes it look dirty. I have some of the goblets and wine glasses that match this pattern and they're much nicer than the pitcher."
3,Solid Background Music for Coffee & Coffee Lounging,"This is not really dance lounge but background tracks for lounging at a coffee house.These are all solid, professional tracks - cool jazz ballads or samba but this CD isn't really designed for sitting and listening ... and frankly, I don't think the tracks are distinctive enough even for a dinner party where you want cool music to reflect your great taste, this CD is for when you want the background music to set a faint mood but it's not noticeable enough for anyone to actually stop & ask you for track information.If you need pleasant and innocuous background music at a coffee bar or an appropriate boutique store, this CD will serve nicely but that pretty much sums it up - it's nice & pleasant but not dazzling or distinctive."
4,Genealogy of Some Descendants of Edward Fuller of the Mayflower,The book helped me in pursuing information about my Mayflower ancestor. Unfortunately it did not go far enough for me. I needed the complete genealogy.
2,Just Couldn't Give it the 1 Star it deserved,"I would like to read more by this author, despite the fact that I totally disliked this book. The storyline was just boring. I hated that Iantha went through such horror, too."
2,Just Not Interesting...,"This author is probably good, if the stars are any indication, but I found this story dull and Lord Duncan not manly enough."
2,Microscopic,"All I can say is this was the tiniest bear ever for how much they charged for it. For starters it is 6.5"" not 8"" which is just false advertising. It is a super cute toy but I would have never paid $40.00 this if I knew how small it was."
2,COULD HAVE GOTTEN IT CHEAPER IN TOWN,"NOT TOO IMPRESSED, I FOUND THE SAME ONE AT A LOCAL STORE FOR LESS MONEY AND NO SHIPPING AND HANDLEING,, WISH I WOULD HAVE NOT DONE AN IMPULSE BUY ON THIS ITEM!"
2,pop up assembly,THe pop up assembly that came with this faucet does not work at all.very dissapointed in danze for this.will think twice before purchasing any more danze products.!!!!!
2,Collecter's Only,"A pretty bland book from a historical perspective. A couple of nice interviews with an employee of Gilbert's and some interesting interoffice memos and advertising information, but the majority of the book covers the differences in sets throughout the years. The information, for the most part, has been covered elsewhere."
5,COOL COOL COOL !!!,A great album of soothing relaxing jazz standards!!....perfect for a quiet night in with a good bottle of wine with a friend!!
5,Darling!,This little turle is so cute. We were pleasantly surprised that it arrived in time for Christmas because we placed our order only a few days before the holiday rush.
4,These tracks define Earl Scruggs' career,The tracks on this two CD set include many well known Flatt & Scruggs tunes as well as collaborations with other artists. Many fond memories.
5,Earl Was A Master At His Craft,"Earl was the consummate bluegrass picker and this album does not disappoint. I was very sorry to learn Earl Scruggs had passed on and I wanted a remembrance - I could not have made a better choice. The Essential Earl Scruggs has 40 of Earl's best and it kind of follows the history of the man. Buy it...you'll love it. I'm now going through the book Earl Scruggs And The 5-String Banjo plus CD. I have my 5-string banjo purchased according to Earl's recommendations and I'm getting halfway decent. I'll never be in Earl's league, but this album keeps me movin' on. CCM"
5,Very nice !,"I have always loved the sound of Banjo. The singer's voice has an ""old-world"" charm about it. I am tired of the synthesized/robotized/tinny voices of current times."
1,One of the worst business books I have read,Don't even waste your time on this book...it's written in an oversimplistic way and offers nothing new!
5,Effective!,"Since I didn't know much about drilling holes in rocks, I researched other reviews on Amazon before making a choice. Because I'm not a contractor, there wasn't a reasonable justification to go for a SDS drill. I have a V-28 Milwaukee cordless hammer drill, and found that the DeWalt carbide hammer drills had numerous strong reviews. This bit was quite good - I drilled 6 holes, each about 3-4 inches deep in solid boulders. The bit performed well - using water for cooling and dust removal - granite clearly took more effort than softer stone, but the bit remained effective even after the granite holes. I'd easily buy a bit in this series again for other projects."
5,hygine bag,"great product, water proof, its perfect size, i highly recommend this for those surfers out there, even for the average joe shmoe, this piece of gear is great for traveling,"
5,just fantastic,"absolutely great material - incorporating the backbone of brit pop. ""life of riley"", the everlasting classic, ""sense"" - maybe their best cut at all, ""what you say"", ""you showed me"" & ""waiting for today to happen"". broudie et al. are genious. if you're into british pop music you gotta have this one in your collection."
5,Ray Brown - out with a bang.,"Superb. The famous, talented bassist Ray Brown has several different all-star lineups (check the CD info online) of amazing musicians backing him up in this 2-CD album. One of the best purchases I have made as far as jazz albums go."
5,Ray Brown Trio is the Best,"BASSICS: BEST OF RAY BROWN TRIO 1977-2000 is a treasure of jazz trio music, especially with jazz bass and amazing piano. I am happy to have discovered the Ray Brown Trio and have purchased all CD's I can get my hands on."
5,"Top of the world, Ma !!","This version of RTK is the best by far in my opinion. To do away with all the melodrama of other critics...this is one is the most versatile of all the series. The ""growing pains"" of your created character are directly impacted within the RTK world you play in. Lets be for real, what are the chances of a 90 rated free officer offering his services to a new jack?The concept of getting to know an free officer and building relations was great. The battle scenarios and help/ tutilage through the different characters is another plus. Lastly, the concept of 'observing' first to increase productivity is even greater.This is the collectors edition for the RTKer who wants to experience true and thorough gameplay."
4,Retired with Husband,"In ""Retired with Husband"" the reader is taken on a journey into uncharted territory for baby boomers who are settling into retirement. Rather than an ending, it is cited as a delightful adventure into second adulthood, with new guidelines. Humorous and Empowering!--Carolyn Porter, D. Div., author of ""The Realness of a Woman"" For more information and a free ebook entitled Stress Free Living visit drcarolynporter.com"
3,Retired With Husband,"Light-hearted, but not light-minded reading. Floyd gives much useful information about the life-changing event for couples who enter retirement age together.Dr. WaldaAtlanta, Ga"
1,waste of money,This book was a waste of money and time reading. No help with retirement for us.The book shows view point from one woman and not from her husband.There are other books on the market that are of more help with this topic.
3,a pleasant way to spend a few hours,"A rather unpopular FBI agent is found murdered on the FBI shooting range, much to the embarrassment of the bureau and even more embarrassing is that the body was found during a full visitors' tour. The less than choice assignment of investigating the murder sets the agents in charge on a trail that leads to corruption in high places.This is an adequate tale, cast with rather stock characters - the idealistic young FBI agent, her callous fellow FBI agent and lover, the mysterious writer, the merry widow etc. The action is predictible with few surprises along the way.This is one to pick up at the library or at most a resale shop for a way to spend a few hours then pass along rather than give shelf space."
4,Interesting,"Book has useful information. A lot relates to me. Easy to understand, but not sure it will solve my problem. It's very difficult to put into practice as it suggests."
2,"A good book, but there are better ones available.",This book provides a good overview of the problem of shyness. I found it limited in terms of how helpful it is to the shy person. I would supplement this book with others on the markert.
4,Clear and systematic approach,"If you want a well-organized, step-by-step, basic approach to therapy for social anxiety, you will find this book very helpful."
1,Junk not universal.,Wasn't till I took off my fan did I realize that it's wasn't as universal as advertised. Was kinda glad it didn't fit because it gave the appearance of a stamped out piece of junk.
1,WORST GAME EVER!!!!,"When I played Dynasty Warriors 4 I thought the game was great and one of the best I ever played.(On my friends X-box) So I thought I'd buy DW4XL and get the original an an extra feature while I am at it. So I go home and play it and get three crappy new features only. Some stupid xtreme mode where you start with a crappy character and get absolutely NO health in the level. You get a stupid legend mode which has ONE level for each weak character and your experience doesnt travel over to xtreme mode. And arena mode which was the same as the old game. Plus, you dont get musou mode or free mode which was EXTREMELY lazy of Koei. It is extremely deceiving when you buy it and makes you think that it has all the features of the old one and new features but instead it just has 3 useless, stupid games. This is easily one of the stupidest games I have ever wasted my money on. I am going to return this and get the original as soon as possible. Don't waste any money on this."
1,Wow this game sux!!!!,"In the midst of my farting in the isle of the video game store i came across dynasty warriors 4 xl. Ohh i thought to myself, this sounds cool. Well, ladies and gentlemen it isn't!!!! The graphics suck and i even look more like a chinese warrior than these stupid imposter samurai wannabes. I hate the weapons, the characters, and most of all the people who have dumbed the American public by producing this game. I wish every copy of this game made was burned. The end."
2,A fine game - if you're psychic and not easily bored.,"It's repetitive. I think that's been mentioned. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing; I played Tetris ad nauseum as a kid, I can hardly complain about doing the same thing faster every level. The biggest reason that I think the $2 my friend paid for this was overcharging: it's unplayable. Seriously. Unless you are psychic or have an amazing guessing ability, figuring out how to play this game is next to impossible. I finally found a video on Youtube - in Dutch, I think- that showed how to play it. I would NEVER have figured that out.Once you know that, it's not hard to do. The mini games get annoying; you get into a rhythm of tending pets and suddenly you're dragged into squishing fleas again.I enjoy monotonous sometimes, and I'll probably play this when I need something mindless to occupy me. But if I had bought this anywhere but the bargain bin, I'd be livid."
1,DS games don't get much worse than this...,"Ok, I own over 300 DS games, so you could say I know a great DS game when it comes along and this was not one of them...not even close! Like another reviewer said, after playing the first few levels, it gets real repetitious and very boring. I enjoy some of the pet care/vet type games so I thought I'd give it a go and now I wish I would've bought a different DS game altogether. Please save your money or buy one of the other pet care/vet games, Amazon has lots to choose from!"
2,Sharlene - age 10 - BORING !!!!!,"At first I was having fun but once you get to the third or fourth level, all you get to really do on any of the levels is play 3 mini games over and over again, and at the start you just put stations and rooms into the hotel. One more thing, all you get to do, other than the mini games, is put pets in houses.... After two days of playing with my new game, I got bored of it !!!! Don't waste your money on this boring game."
1,awful,im 21 years old and i could not figure out how to play this game. i dont know how a child is supposed to. unless there really was no point at all to the game. it was incredibly stupid
1,Worse ds game ever Im poor and wished I'd have given $ to Charity,All I can say is this is the worse DS game ever invented .There's no point to it >The graphics are terrible and if I was a rich person I would have donated it to toys for tots (but their dissappointment on X-Mas would have been too much)I am not rich however so I wish I would have had reviews to read so I would have bought something else.Between this and the Nancy Drew game i got that I finished in less then a day I couldn'y say which is worse
4,fiddle and percussion duets from Norway,"from CD Roots: Vägen in presents fiddler Mats Edén and percussionist Tina Quartey in a stunning duet debut. Mats' life-long Värmland traditions and his new interest in neighboring Norwegian melodies is a remarkably intuitive fit for Tina's explorations in Afro-Cuban and Brazilian percussion. With their backgrounds in groundbreaking ensembles like Frifot, Groupa and Filarfolket, it is no surprise that what they deliver is innovative music, challenging and yet deeply rooted in tradition."
3,Not Strong Enough for Stone?,"I got these primarily so I could mount some signs on my stone pillars--into the stone, not mortar. It did okay on the first two holes (same stone), but on the next, it just wasn't cutting it. I switched to the 1/4"" and it did a bit better, so I assume the bit just couldn't take it. Was a tad disappointed it couldn't manage more than two holes. It's possible I wasn't doing something right, so if you know better, then good for you. But for me it didn't quite work out. On the other hand, it does just fine in mortar, so your mileage may vary."
5,"Great product, as described!","This garnish tray looks great and works incredibly well, either with a simple ice bath underneath the individual fruit trays, or by the 3 chill-packs that come with the product. Feels built to last and has been hardy throughout!"
3,"A book of parables, but not up to the level of ""wisdom""","This is a book with average-level parables. I certainly would not call these stories the words of wisdom. They are not up to the level of Aesop's Fables. But then, this book is better than a lot of other so called non-Biblical parable books."
4,"Good pictures, design ideas. Good intro to building a gate","I purchased this book because I was building an outdoor gate for the first time, and I needed the ""how-to"" of designing a gate, both from a structural and an asthetic perspective. This book was perfect for this beginner gate designer - good examples, pictures and design ideas."
4,Very Useful,"I own a Victorian Cottage in Texas and purchased this book hoping for some ideas on building my own unique picket fence. The book has tons of pictures and drawings of fence designs. We actually used two different designs and came up with a ""one of a kind"" fence around our yard. It became the talk of the town for a while and now our house is known as ""the one with the fence""!The book is a little short on details of building the fences, but if you are skilled with tools, you will figure it out. We are starting our second fence with it this month, which we hope is a masterpiece. I recommend this book if you need Victorian fence ideas."
2,"If you don't have a Victorian, forget this book","It's a very nicely drawn & explained book but if you have any other style home other than Victorian, there are limited styles that would match. Also, you have to order patterns separately."
5,Finally a book to help me buy in bulk and store effectively!,This is a great book to learn to buy and store in bulk. An added bonus is the wonderful recipes.
5,Great,"As Mr D. is related to a lot of royal families in Europe, except maybe the Dutch one, there is lot to be learned here. It would be nice, now that a lot of things have changed, including, I suppose, his opinion about the faux Anastasia, to have an update.As his book is mentioned in the reference section of a lot of recent books about the Romanovs, it was a great pleasure for me to finally get hold of it.Wonderful, interesting reading, written by a very ""sympathique"" person."
1,CRAP... AMATUER TRANSFER... THIRD WORLD?,"I have never seen or heard such a crappy transfer. The best part of this is the cover art. I enjoyed the series years ago when it was on. The picture was better and the sound was clear. Even turned up way too loud, this transfer sounds like I'm listening through a wall! When I popped this into my DVD player I was hoping for a decent transfer but it looks like a pirated dvd the nice third world lady comes to all the local stores with. It might as well have been transferred using a cheap video camera in a popcorn box at the local itch! DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO TOTALLY WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Oh, yeah, the shipping was very fast. It may go back just as fast!"
2,"poor quality, especially audio","The picture quality is not great, but the audio is awful, very muddled. Someone likened the quality to a bootleg video in another review and I couldn't agree more."
5,Aaah Wordsworth you old lovely!,"Yes there are discrepancies, yes some scenes are cut, indeed there is no captioning, and yes it certainly deserves better but.................. this gem is priceless and for all the curmudgeons who so fractiously complain, this Aussie says get a life!!! Rumpole? ALL THE EPISODES? For THIS price? Well, chop me up and use me for suet pudding, complain about this and you either do not know, and love, Rumpole. Or you have no true sense of value. No point in reviewing the stories, you either know and love them, or you need to read the book, or buy this set. The price does cover for a multitude of sins true, but for the afficionados lets thank A & E for giving us this much. The comparative price in England is over 300 English pounds for the total set (if you can get them! and that is 2nd hand!!!!) or 25 English pounds for each individual disc. Work out you own exchange rate and then buy this!!!!!"
2,Very disappointing,"As someone who watched this show on PBS in the 1970s/1980s, I was really looking forward to having the DVD set of the whole show, but then after I received it and actually started watching it, I realized that there were a lot of problems. First of all there are no subtitles. This is a problem because the sound quality/transfer is mediocre, and thus it's difficult to tell what is being said: there's a lot of dialogue that's spoken in heavily-accented English with regional dialects, so for an American it's hard to keep track of the story. (Presumably I was better able to watch it 35 years ago due to better sound quality on PBS, and my hearing was a lot better).The picture quality is also not very good; this was obviously a cheap video transfer effort, so the visuals look washed-out to me.Having only ended up watching one episode, I'm now saddled with the entire DVD set that no one else around me is interested in even watching, much less buying from me."
2,"Great series, terrible video and sound","I loved this series when it first came out as did my mother. Trouble is she is now 86. Rumpole is known for mumbling a lot of derogatory comments under his breath and the sound quality and picture quality is so poor it makes it a chore to watch. If it had close captioning it would be worth it, but as it stands, this is one of the few items that I am sorry I bought"
5,She Who Must Be OBAYED,"Quick, Funny, Human and to the point. One of the great BBC programs.Horace is every mans hero."
2,Watch out!,"Don't buy this if you or someone watching it needs closed captioning. I bought it for my dad, but it is unwatchable because he can't tell what people are saying."
5,Rascally Rumpole Rules,"There isn't more fun tha re-visiting Rumpole of the Bailey, at the Bailey and in Chambers. The series is timeless: it holds up today, over 30 years since it was originally produced. No special effects; just special writing and acting. There are many memorable characters: Rumpole, himself; She, who must be obeyed; and RumpolesChambers-mates."
5,Rumpole rocks!,I remember watching this on the ABC growing up - I enjoyed it then and appreciate the acting/script even more so now. Leo McKern is perfect for the role and the support cast is excellent. Brilliantly written and such an insightful study of the legal and class systems in Britain. Rumpole the maverick battling the odds for the underdog - great stuff!
5,Love the British!,"My daughter lived in the UK for several years and became addicted to British TV - she now has me addicted. Love nearly all the PBS mystery series, Rumpole being one of the best. Thank you, Amazon, for consistently providing the best in complete series sets!"
1,Could not understand dialogue,"We watch tons of British film and TV, but could not understand at least half the dialogue in this. (We are 50 and our hearing is not QUITE as good as it used to be, but we're certainly not deaf -- and had no trouble recently with Foyle's War, Poldark or the Pallisers.) As others have said, there are a lot of working-class accents, Rumpole muttering under his breath or talking with a cigarette clenched between teeth, and just generally very fast speech. When the DVD froze about 10 minutes in, we couldn't be bothered to try again."
2,a bit of a disappointment,I bought these after hearing several good radio theater Rumpole shows. The video Rumpole character is little more than a hopless British WC Fields less the sense of humor. I'm not sure these are worth donating to the thrift store.
3,Rumpole Review,This is a typical British series. Not real fast moving but not bad for what it is. We watched these when there was nothing on TV and got to enjoying them more as each episode was viewed. If you enjoy British TV series you will probably like these.
3,rumole of the old bailey,"rumpole of the old baileyVery good acting although the British Speek is difficult to understand. Not just the accents, but dialog/words passed me by.Sorry I invested in the entire series.jaacquelyn"
3,sound quality awful,"watched this on tv as a kid and was looking forward to watching it again as adult. reviews warned this version had bad sound quality and indeed it does it like listening to someone down a well. I had another box set on my wish list with better reviews, but i was gifted this poor(lower priced) sound quality version instead :("
5,My husband says it's the best Christmas gift he's ever received!,For long driving trips we often listen to books on tape. After listening to the Rumpole tapes several times I bought the entire collection of DVD's for my husband for Christmas. We both thoroughly enjoy watching this series. We have long been fans of British comedy and would highly recommend this collection to like-minded people. Rumpole is a delightful character and the story lines are very entertaining. Such a welcome relief to all the horrible programing available on television today - VERY ENJOYABLE!!! Highly recommended.
4,Great shows but no captioning,"While the stories and the performances on these Rumpole disks are great, this set, like a significant number of A&E Video sets of British productions, lacks close-captioning. So whether you are are hearing impaired or would just like a little help with the British accents, these disks won't help you out."
4,Terrific series,"Well written, casted and acted. The only draw back for me was the lack of captioning."
3,Disappointed,"I spent a lot of time online looking for the perfect Aurora dress. This looked like it but for the money I spent, I don't think it was worth it. I didn't think it was a well made dress. I also was not aware that you couldn't return it except for size."
1,Not Worth The Money,The dress doesn't have a long enough opening in the back for a normal sized 4 year old to get on comfortably. The material is CHEAP. The collar isn't sewed properly so it doesn't sit right.The return policy from this company is not very good. 25% restocking fee or store credit. Why would I want store credit with a company that sells items with poor quality.
2,Kaze No Densetu,"Although i am a great fan of Himekami,I personally found this CD a bit of a disappointment.For me to many vocals but having said this i will still buy more as one good track from Himekami is worth the price of the whole CD."
2,ATT poor quality,"Good phone but poor quality, Just died after 1.5 years of use, The handset do not pick up charge any more, new battery replacement doesn't work either, what a waste."
2,Disappointed with AT&T Once a Quality Company,"Bought this AT&T E5655 5.8GHZ with answering machine just a year ago, went dead. First the quality of Hearing calls and Callers hearing voice does a descent job. Occasionally, there were drop outs and recording the outgoing messages were not always accurate sounding. Now the handset went dead, thus cannot access the features of base station. I would not recommend this AT&T, once quality phone company. PLUS OVERPRICED!"
2,"nice idea, but....","it sorta works, that is if I don't move around in the tub and make currents in the water that dislodge the device and I have it firmly wedged into place and slowly move into a more comfortable position, this thing will significantly slow the draining of the bathwater.It doesn't just 'float' into place on the overflow drain hole, if not held up at the overflow it sinks like a rock - I have to continue to hold it there as the water is rising to keep the water in while it it rising and keep it correctly aligned in order for it to stay there to be held in place by water pressure. Disappointing."
2,kinda works with tweaks,"This thing only stays on when the bathtub is already filled above the drain line, and you have to hold it in place while the tub is filling. I used a rubber band to hold it in place so I can lay back and relax while the tub is filling and that kinda works."
1,one star to many,this item ( bath topper) just plain doesn't work. i still have it bacausethe shipping costs to return it are more than the thing costs.i've tried gluing it. it doesn't work
1,Agreed...so doesn't work,I agree with the prior reviewers. I was excited when I first ordered this because it's much smaller than the cover type. Bottom line though....it doesn't work. It *barely* stays on with the suction created from the water above its level and if you move around...it dislodges. What a shame too because I like the design. Would be better if it had like a fitted rubber gromet that could be pushed into the overflow rectangular hole that it's trying to block.
1,Does not work! Don't waste your money.,"This seems like a great idea, but the design is flawed. This flimsy contraption does not stick in place, you have to hold it until the water is above and it still slides down when you move your hand. I took a bath, held it up with my foot and still heard the annoying drainage noise as the water slowly leaked into the overflow valve. I should have listened to the other reviews! To spend [...] + 6.00 shipping, this was a HUGE waste of money. I'm better off using packing tape to block the water."
1,meh,impossible to use correctly. just go buy the one that suction cups over the whole drain. don't waste your money on this.
5,The Untold Story,"A book for persons who love biblical wisdom but who can't quite make the stories mesh. This book will help you understand your frustration. Well-researched with pointers to many, many original works that almost got squeezed out of history. A tip: Do not give this book as a gift to a fundamentalist whose faith depends on every word of the New Testament being literally true. This book is for those who want to know the parts of the story that aren't in The Book."
5,Gospel of Jesus by Davidson,"Excellent piece of work! Take time reading each and every word, and digesting it slowly! Great references and written from a spiritual and scholarly perspective!"
5,Like a Reps & Amps Bible,"Twan Leenders has used his extraordinary knowledge and cool wit to create what is truly a revised Bible for the herpetological world. I recently ventured to Costa Rica on a field expedition in attempts to create an inventory of species in a certain area of rainforest, and had Twan's book with me 24/7. Not only is the information detailed and well-thought out; it is interesting to read and inspiring to the naturalist. I have had the pleasure of meeting Twan Leenders and can say with all honesty that he is one of the most respectable and knowledgable herpetologists in the field. Thank you Twan for your talent and depth of character, and for understanding and promoting the integrity of our living resources."
3,Disappointing field guide,"What I liked best about this book was the detailed descriptions offered in such a compact book. It is far more managable than Savage's book.However as a 'field guide' I found this book really lacking. The photographs are often dark and taken very nonprofessionally. Also has a poor index. Poor-lighting, not using polarizer filters on wet turtle shots, poor presentation of the specimens encountered all really hurt this guide.Further it seems very incomplete. It seems several of herps I saw on my trip through were not included in at least the photographic portions of this book making it rather weak for field work. I actually carried along a little foldout frog/toad panflet that seemed to be more generally useful.Still for the size and the text it certainly is worth including in your natural history guide books if you go to Costa Rica."
4,great at times,"every hubert selby jnr. book is an enjoyable read,and still completely different from what every one else is doing. he is compassionate and yet brutal in his prose. this is a collection of short stories, and as with all short story collections it is a mixed bag at times. the best here are the coat, about an alcoholic tramps love for his coat, so much so that he's willing to die to die for it and the title story seemingly a story of a depressed mans near death experience in the snow and his sudden realisation that he loves his life. read this book, it's easy to read but there are underlying meanings that some will and some won't quite understand.i'm not sure if i did but i thoroughly enjoyed guessing and will continue to."
4,Well made.,"This was a perfect fit in girth, but too short in length for my shih-tzu. I ended up purchasing a Small and altering it at the top seam."
5,Dog rain coat,I bought this same rain coat for my 2 other dogs at a pet store which cost a lot of money. They didn't have it in extra small so I went on Amazon and found it. I even paid a lot less. I should have ordered all 3 from them!!! This rain coat is great. It keeps them dry from head to toe except their feet :o)
5,Gaiking,"Gaiking was one of first japanamated cartoon series to be released in the United States, late 1970's to early 1980's, it has gone by different titles like ""Space Dragon Kargo"", which makes it hard for old fans to find copies. The series was well written, with good animation, for old fans Gaiking is a step back in time."
3,Ex baseball pitcher get offer to pilot Gaiking,"This 2 episode video starts out with a hot shot baseball pitcher who is injured by agents of a alien race out to take over the world. The ex-pitcher get a once in the life time offer to be the pilot of Gaiking.With the exception of the constant reminder about how his injury occured, the 2 part video moves along at a fast pace. Its a self contained show and can be viewed as a single video or part of a collection."
2,bought used,bought this movie used. was not told that the beginning of the movie audio and video are messed up .
3,"Want to go to ""The Town""?",Checked this one out based on a number of favorable reviews. Was it as good as promised? Yes and no. Good acting and some interesting characters - but the story moved along at a sluggish pace and predictable path. Not a bad movie - just not a memorable one...
3,"Ben Affleck, Just Ughhh","People are so easily pleased with movies these days because of the obvious lack in quality of films over the past few years. Now that doesn't mean this movie is terrible, but it's definitely NOT all it's cracked up to be. Yes it is reminiscent of Michael Mann's Heat but shorter, with a Boston backdrop (a great break from the typical LA) and not nearly as good. The film has some good action scenes but the other stream of the story, with Rebecca Hall's character, drags on. The most disappointing part of the film to me is how good it could have been if Mr. Affleck, having written and directed AND taken the starring role himself had *spoiler alert* encountered the same fate as his comrades. I personally can't stand Ben Affleck but if you can bare him it's a decent film. Jeremy Renner was incredible and incomparable to every other actor in the film."
3,A reminisce of the movie Heat,"I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt to see how it will resemblance with the movie Heat. After watching it, Heat is definitely better. In consolation, it wasn't a bad movie. I thought Ben Affleck did a great job on his directorial debut. Had Heat never existed, I would've given this a four star. Why not a five star you may ask? Because some of the actors are not that well known or I should say the least, suitable for the role (again, in comparison with Heat).Overall, the movie is okay with good action fighting sequence. Would I buy this bluray again had I known or seen this movie in the theatres first? Maybe."
4,Action and a little romance,"I enjoyed this movie. I didn't expect that much action, and it did keep my attention span through the entire movie as I am one to fall asleep easily in a boring minute. However, there is a lot of cussing and vulgar language."
2,an okay movie,this movie was okaky. the acting was good in the movie but the story line was kinda lame. i've seen better robber movies. all in all it was okay
4,Action packed,Lots of action and not a bad story either. Violent scenes were realistic but not gratuitous. A solid 4 stars.
3,"Be careful, there is no commentary on the DVD in this como pack!","This is a great movie, but I find it very annoying that the director's commentary is only included on the blu ray version in this combo pack. Just seems like a cheap shot. I had bought the single DVD version as a gift for Christmas, and it has some special features but no commentary. The person liked the movie so much I bought this combo thinking the DVD would allow him to listen to the commentary. The DVD/Blu Ray Combo makes is sound like the commentary would be on the DVD, too, but it's not. I don't get why they wouldn't include it, when it's on the blu ray anyway that you've had to buy to get the commentary!"
4,Great Movie!,This film is awesome. The Town is a must see action packed film.My Review: 8.5/10PROS:-Great Story-Great ActingCONS:-You can kind of predict the ending.
4,Solid action movie,"Solid action movie. Covers well worn ground, but it didn't feel derivative. Almost lost a star due to the ham-fisted Joline song edit at the end. Re-ordered the verses. I will NEVER understand why people making movies think people won't notice that kind of thing."
3,Good but Slow,"This movie is nice but very, very slow. I thought I missed it when I could not go to the movie theatre but don't it regret after watching it on Amazon VOD........."
5,"Fantastic film - excellent acting, writing, directing","I am a little biased being from MA/Boston - but this is up there with any drama and/or suspense movie. For me - the realism is key - the familiarity with accurate Boston sub-culture, etc. The acting - is really well-done - the directing by Ben Affleck is probably the best part of this movie outside the acting, as it frames the story and cinemetography.Highly recommend - this is in my top 20 movies of all time. As good as ""Heat"" or other Michael Mann flicks in terms of raw suspense - and as good as ""Good Will Hunting"" in terms of writing/directing."
2,DVD extended cut missing -The Town / unsatisfied,"I ordered this specific item, the movie disc, The Town, because it stated it was the extended cut version and had both the Blu-ray and DVD discs included.When I received the product, only the Blu-ray had the extended cut version. DVD is NOT extended cut. I feel deceived from the information I had when I placed the order with Amazon."
3,Nothing new or worth bragging about,"I heard some really rave reviews for this movie on Rottentomatoes.com and thought I would check it out on video. I've never cared much for Ben Affleck movies. I guess for Affleck this is a pretty good movie though. It seemed to me like he took the movie 'Heat' and 'The Departed', and rolled them into one. Only the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts."
2,foul language,"the story line was good, but it had so much foul language I could barely force myself to get through it just so I could see how it ended. sigh. had I known this ahead of time, I would have never started the movie!"
1,Damaged,"I had to return the DVD, because the disk was loose in the case, and had been cracked and scratched. I wasn't able to exchange it for a new DVD but had to return it and buy a new one. I hope the second one doesn't come in the same condition."
2,On the town....,"Entertaining enough for those who don't think too much.There, I said it - I'm sure I'll get the usual insulting posts.There is very little originality in the plot; the direction, though,was quite tight (mostly) but the action sequences were simplyaction sequences which did little to elevate this film intoanything more than an action film. Afleck was not believableunfortunately, and neither was the story line or, for that matter,the action sequences.Why would anyone choose a career as a security guard in that place?Answers on a postcard, please, to: Bloodnock c/o Amazon.com."
3,GOOD MOVIE,"AFFLECK AT HIS BEST, VERY GOOD MOVIE. HE ALWAYS ACTS WELL, AND WHEN HE DIRECTS HIS MOVIES ARE ALSO GOOD."
4,Great Movie...a little light on the ending,So breaking out of the childhood groove is not an easy task. A little light on the ending as he gets set up and heads to Florida to get away from it all
4,The Town dvd,"Entertaining for adults on an evening to relax. It is not a 'block-buster' , but keeps you interested. Plenty of action in my opinion."
4,"Good, thinking action film","I liked Town. It had good action sequences, and a decent story line. Sometimes the story line got a little slow, but thats okay because it's still an action movie at its core.I bought it because a friend of mine said if I liked the movie ""Heat"", I'd like this one. This movie didn't come close to the action in Heat. However, it's still decent, and worth at least one watching."
4,"BOSTON CRIME, BABY!",Another take on Boston crime with a focus on a bank robber who ends up dating one of the women he held captive. It's more about the relationships than the actual heists but don't worry you'll see some of those as well. It's in a similar flavor to THE DEPARTED but that's a better picture. DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; SETTING: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: February 2011; MY GRADE: B to B plus.
3,Good.,"It's too derivative of Heat, to the point of distraction.Nevertheless, The Town showcases some nailed performances - particularly the mentioned Jeremy Renner but also Affleck himself, the reliable Chris Cooper, Blake Lively, and Pete Postlethwaite - characters which anyone familiar with the neighborhoods depicted would recognize, certainly to a greater extent than, say, The Departed.It is impressively constructed, production-wise and narratively, if a bit less sweeping than some of the influences it echoes (the original Thomas Crown Affair, The Friends Of Eddie Coyle, Heat, Monument Ave, Boondock Saints, The Brinks Job, even Point Break), and perhaps we should take Mr. Affleck seriously as the actual brains behind the Affleck-Damon partnership."
4,Decent heist movie,"I went in to this not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I liked this movie a lot, and I'd feel confident recommending others watch it. It was also very cool to see Slaine in it, I'm a big fan and it's awesome to see someone be able to perform well in more than one medium. This edition is more of the definitive one as well, with another ending and a ton of bonus materials. If you're going to pick up The Town, this is the one to get."
4,Excellent crime-action-drama film by Ben Affleck,"Ben Affleck once again surprises as his career seems to be heading into Clint Eastwood territory. That is, act in a few good movies, including your own, but directing may be his real forte. This crime-action-drama is complete with some excellent acting especially Jeremy Renner of ""Hurt Locker"" fame. A big surprise for me was Blake Lively as well. Although I know who she is, I've never seen her act and she's very good here. This film has what you would want in a complete movie; an interesting premise and story (if nothing new) along with conflict, drama and a little sex. Even the car chases and shoot-outs are pretty well done, if unrealistic. The Blu ray transfer is well done complete with DTS-HD Master Audio."
4,Decent Movie,"I thought this movie was decent, not great or fantastic as the fanfare a couple years back would make you believe. The acting was great and writing was good, it just left me wanting a little more. Worth the rental if you'd like to see something different from the normal ""good guy"" point of view."
4,Simple story line executed exceptionally well,"I enjoyed this movie and you can find several movie reviews elsewhere. Since this is an Amazon.com product, here is my review of such.As part of ""Digital"" products being offered my Amazon.com, I would like to point out that the XBOX interface is better than netflix, its faster to load and navigate. However, there is no option for subtitles for this movie, which makes it difficult to watch when you have kids or other members of the house sleeping in adjacent rooms. The Amazon app on XBOX lacks the ability to purchase new content, I think thats partly due to the way purchase options are set up on XBOX. On PS3 app for Amazon, the interface is just as quick, however it adds the ability to purchase new content and add it to your video library."
5,Great movie,"Sit down and watch all the way through. It's kinda fast paced, and if you don't pay attention you will miss some stuff."
4,best ben affleck film,i think this is the best ben affleck film i have ever seen him play in. i know people talk smack about him but i have to say this film he does a great job. great movie different from your regular action movies.
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,SUCH A GOOD MOVIES I LOVE IT! AND IT WAS SUPER CHEAP! SEEN IT AT MOVIE'S AND I KNEW WHEN IT CAME OUT ON DVD I JUST HAD TO GET IT!!
4,Intriguing tale of crime and conflicting loyalties,"Better than your average caper movie, ""The Town"" focuses on a group of four career criminals (led by Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner, who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) from Charlestown in Boston. They're smart and good at what they do--until Ben Affleck's character falls for the bank manager they rob. Wanting to leave his criminal past behind him, he appeals to his cohorts, who refuse to let him get away before pulling off one last job. Commitment to friends becomes compromised with his developing love for the bank manager, and the authorities, in the form of Jon Hamm as an FBI agent and the always underappreciated Titus Welliver as a Boston PD detective, begin closing in. The story is smart and well-developed, and the action sequences are explosive and exciting. Not quite sure this movie is Oscar material, as some have argued, but it certainly affirms that Affleck has matured considerably as an actor and a director."
2,NOT UP TO THE HYPE BEN!,"Saw over X-Mas on DVD. Couldn't believe it wasn't as good as I had heard. A bank robbing movie that has more Drama than bank robbing is almost doomed to fail, unless it's in the hands of a great Director. Sorry Ben, not there yet. Gone Baby Gone was a great ride, but I believe that had more to do with acting and WHO wrote it than Ben. The Town is worth a watch, but ask anyone what they liked about it and you'll get the, ""not sure"" answer a lot. Not a good sign about a film when you can't remember what you liked about it, especially when you just finished it. That 1st act is really long winded and boring Ben! In Ben I trust, maybe next time, or not?"
2,Like Goodwill Hunting with Guns,"I found this movie dragged in parts. I was told it was alot like Heat with the exception that Heat had more heart to it - I actually felt something for those characters. These characters sold the ""scumbag"" theme a little too well. I didn't care about them and when they were killed off, it was more of a relief.Some of the themes from Goodwill Hunting returned in this movie. I was not impressed by the irony.This was really not worth the time. Maybe being shown on TV will breath new life into it."
3,A Decent Shoot-Em-Up!,"This was without a doubt the best action film Ben Affleck has done since Pearl Harbor. However, there was too much shooting and the script had somewhat poor editing, resulting in some irregularities in the plot. Pearl Harbor was much the same way. Both films had too much action and not enough plot to make them a sensible story. Ben Affleck was a great actor in this film and I liked the complex relationship his character had with his brother. Also, when they planned their biggest heist, I was nervous that they might get caught. Still, of all the masks they could have worn to rob a bank, why did they choose to wear nun masks? I mean those masks make them look too creepy. Overall, despite the apparent flaws this movie has, it is a very enjoyable film for anyone who enjoys good old-fashioned drama.Pearl Harbor [Blu-ray]The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell"
1,Should have been great and IS...unless you have a moral compass,"Has all the trappings of a very good action/adventure/drama: excellent director/actor in Ben Affleck...John Hamm, Jeremy Renner. Interesting plot. The whole thing is subverted by the absolute lack of a moral compass in the plot structure and characters. We are supposed somehow to identify with Doug, a career criminal who, with his co-conspirators, rob banks, destroy property, put lives in jeopardy, kidnaps and terrorizes an innocent witness. Then, after accumulating all this money decides to leave ""the town"" with Claire and leave his life of crime. Is it due to remorse over his antisocial, criminal life? Not hinted at. Just tired of it. I was actually angry as I left the theater, and cannot to this day understand how rational people think this film is so great. If you want great Ben Affleck, watch Gone Baby Gone. Big thumbs down to this one (sorry, Roger Ebert for stealing your copyrighted phrase)."
3,Too violent,It's an engaging movie but I'd rather not have seen it because of the violence. And the talk scenes are too slow and don't fix the holes in the plot. Otherwise a good movie.
1,Bad Movie with No Learning Content,"Here we have a movie attempting to make ""heroes"" out of criminals. It tries to make people feel pity and sorry for the choices criminals make and seems to justify their selfish behaviors. Everyone has sad stories though people who aren't criminals obviously have more integrity and honor than criminals and are more fit to make movies about. Glorifying and romanticizing criminals is not responsible to the culture and kids unless that's what you want kids to become.As a side note I have worked with adolescents in prison and they love this movie as well as others so I decided to watch it and understand it justifies their selfish bad behaviors instead of them making choices that better themselves and others."
1,Extended Cut Only on Blu-Ray,"I'm sure this is a fine film, but beware that the ""combo"" package only provides the ""extended cut"" on blu-ray, not dvd. This is not at all clear from either packaging or the listing on Amazon. Aggravates me as I don't have blu-ray, so I wasted my money on this version."
2,it was alright,"saw this film recently and i thought the directing was on point, but somehow you sorta knew how it might end up and there wasn't alot of counter pacing to make you not think otherwise.i've seen this kind of film countless times and nobody ever gets away and you just know that despite an occasional slip or get away how it is all going to end. it was an ok film."
5,Very well done,"4.5 stars.This was a very well-done movie, for the most part. It reminded me of ""The Departed"" in a lot of ways (but not quite as good) with the whole Irish mob-thing going on. The plot is fairly predictable and the ending is a little bit cliche. Still, Affleck does a great job and really makes the movie. Very enjoyable.Recommended."
4,Good movie,As a Bostonian I think they nailed the Boston feel. I thought the movie had a good pace and It was Ben's second best performance since goodwill hunting.
4,entertaining movie with good acting,This was a thoroughly entertaining movie with lots of action and good acting. I recommend it if you're looking for something entertaining to watch.
3,Very compelling film falters so bad and gets so rote in it's last 20 minutes that it pains me,"I really like the new Ben Affleck . I thought his directorial debut GONE BABY GONE was one of the very finest pictures of its year . I thought he was teriffic in STATE OF PLAY and that that film was quite a good picture . I'm old enough and film curious to have seen a lot of similar films to THE TOWN over the decades . My wife and i watched all but about a half an hour of the film and really dug it (then had to crash) . It was very successful in ratcheting up the tension during this period . The following day , ""Boom"" , it's HEAT (and a thousand others) and the career criminal with a heart-a-gold . Time to leave Beantown Ben . Solid effort undermined . It happens . No ill will . Brilliant cast . Three quarters of a very good film . 3 and 1/2 star out of five ."
4,PROBABLY BEN'S BEST SINCE GOOD WILL HUNTING!,"I have always thought that Ben Affleck has gotten a bad rap, I usually enjoy him in the films he has made...there could be a few exceptions, but I could say that about a lot of other good actors too. He's not going to win a best actor award, but he is someone I want to watch in a film. The Town returns to Affleck's roots of Boston and delivers a very good crime drama with some interesting sub plots. I found this film very engrossing, but not perfect. Some more detail to the characters would have paid off greatly, but it is still an impressive piece of work from Mr. Affleck who directed, co-wrote and stars in this little tale of love and honor among thieves."
4,Affleck proves he's here to stay with another great crime flick,"Ben Affleck returns to the crime genre that served him so well with Gone, Baby, Gone; the result is character-driven action film featuring a knockout cast led by Affleck himself and a superb Jeremy Renner as bank robbers run amok in Boston. The film reeks of authenticity (one character from the film would say it's very authenticious). While lacking the emotional resonance of his first film, The Town still manages to make you care for the characters while providing some of the best action sequences of the year. The film hits all the expected beats - there's really nothing new here; but damn, it's well done. One of the better films this year. With Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite all joining in the drama. 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Enjoyable ride but cliched.,"The good - chase and heist scenes are superbly done, acting is fine, the late Peter Posltethwaite is fantastic in basically a cameo role and the movie is the right length (I haven't seen the extended version)and it will hold your attention from beginning to end.The bad - there are far too many cliches and implausible moments.For example:1. Armed bank robber who really has a heart of gold and tries to control his ultra violent friend to whom he owes a favour.2. Guy wants to escape his life of crime but his friends and boss won't let him go.3. Girl falls for wrong guy, finds out and rejects him only to help him later when he is in need.4. Guy betrayed by girl he rejects for another.5. The ending is silly but predictable and leaves room for a sequel.See what I mean. If you've never seen ""Heat"" or ""Ronin"" I suggest you do so and see what can be done in this genre.That said if you like crime movies, car chases and heist scenes this will be a 90 minutes well spent."
5,Great movie,This movie was excellent and they don't cut all the swears like on tv great buy for such a cheap price
3,Town - language overkill,"The acting and the plot were pretty good. However, my wife and I quit watching it midway due to the language."
2,Town streaming review,"I like the movie ""Town"", I think it's one of Ben Affleck's best efforts. This review is about the streaming quality.1) Please Amazon create some software that allows streaming customers a practical search method for finding and storing titles they'd like to see. Please do this for Prime and nonPrime titles. Your're so far behind Netflix, it's not even funny.2) Streaming quality was pretty bad in spots with noticeable pixallation. True, this could be my less than adequate dsl, but then again, I never have this problem with Netflix.Amazon, you're so good at everything else that these streaming problems are really unbearable, you cannot act soon enough to clean up your act in this regard."
2,Unable to use code to redeem digital copy,"I was really looking forward to redeeming the code for the digital copy in order for me to have this great movie in my computer collection. When I tried reedeming the code it told me that it had expired since mid-December 2011. I believe this is unfair, because i bought right around that time, and usually we are allowed to redeem codes at least months after purchase.I am really dissapointed."
3,split decision,"This was a watchable, workmanlike movie. Some interesting acting & a few novel twists but the movie wants us to root for a guy who kills people quite easily & lies to their kidnap victim to make sure his buddy doesn;t need to kill her too -- & then.........falls in love with her?? What did he think was gonna happen?? I guess I'm an old fashioned girl but I'd like to root for somebody a little less violent no matter what his upbringing was like -- and after he tells his true love that he wants to change.....he actually kills even more people than he had before his revelation. Yikes. I gave it 3 stars because hey.........the guys are mostly good looking (and do bank robbers have the time to be so buff?!?!)the film moves at a good pace, and some of the acting is spot on."
3,"pretty good, but standard","Excellent Affleck in this, excellent Rebecca Hall, all the performances, actually. It's 15 minutess too long, though, and the Fenway Park sequence was where to cut. (Far too similar to same scene in The Heat.)But I hate films with shaky plot devices, and this film has one: so the young woman they fleetingly kidnap (Hall) lives in Charlestown? So what? She didn't see them, and it's doubtful they hang out at the same bars. So why would they all be so upset by discovering she might be a neighbor? But Affleck decides to keep an eye on her, see what she knows. Huh? Far better, I think, they bump into each other at same Laundromat -- in the Hollywood world, that's hardly a preposterous scenario -- and the relationship starts there. He is immediately taken by her (this time) and that element, kidnaper/victim, adds more, not detracts.Loved the line, Affleck to the late great Pete Postlewaite, ""You think you're the only guy in Charlestown with a gun?"""
4,Ben Like I Have Never Seen Him,In this movie he acted and directed roles he has definitely steadily grown into over the years. Admittedly I have never seen him as an action hero firstly but in this endeavor he has done job. Great plot and great acting. Lots of action and even some laughter go.
1,NO COMMENTARY,"This is not a review for the movie. The movie is spectacular.On the Special Features section Amazon says this DVD has a Director's Commentary. That is the reason I bought this. I wanted to listen to the commentary and I don't own a Blu-Ray player (otherwise I would have bought the BD).Still an awesome movie, but no commentary."
2,"Too much ""HEAT""on this one!","Even the music score(action scenes) is similar to Mann's masterpiece...but ""Heat"" remains matchless,well the masks look pretty weird for a change...and the director has completely ignored the idea to put up some fake wigs/beards or even to color the hair of the remaining suspect..& of cos shooting the guy on the head doesn't fit Ben's character + a whole lot more funny things..!"
1,The Town,"The title should be changed to the ""F"" word because that is all you hear from the beginning to the end. Almost every dialogue has cussing or profanity. The acting and the story line are below par. I cannot believe this was rated 4-stars by the reviewers. Don't waste your time and money on this movie. It is not worth it. Don't be fooled by a 4-star rating. One-star is more like it."
1,"Overrated, like Ben Affleck","This is one of those movies that is so derivative, you can literally start listing the films that Affleck lifted ideas from. Thief is one of them for sure, Heat is another, Ronin, so on and so forth. At least in those movies, the characters have personality and the audience can like them. The characters in The Town are absolutely unmemorable and unlikable. Even bad characters can be sentimental. Affleck just didn't try to make this film better. It's contrived, in every way imaginable. I can't believe so many people like it too. They must not have a Netflix account. Expand your tastes in film, people."
4,good but has major flaws,"The game has nice-looking graphics and good control. So why is is a piece of crap compared to the PS2 version?Pros:-Nice plot-Fun-Good controls-Dolby Digital sound in the actual game, not the cinematics (only thing better than PS2 version)Cons:-LOTS of slowdown-LOTS of pop-up-Distracting music-Easy mode is a joke (no kidding)Verdict:If you have played the previous 3 games, stay away! There's nothing new! Otherwise, if you are a newcomer to the XBOX or a new Dynasty Warriors fan, rent first.Final Verdict: 77%"
2,pretty bad,The graphics arent anything special. The customize your officer has no good features. a lot of it is ridiculously hard. annoying music and menus. ive only played the first parts and so far it seems bad. maybe it will get better but i doubt it. rent it dont buy it. short and sweet
4,Awsome Game,"This is such an awsome game! The graphics are awsome! I recommend this game to anyone hwo likes sword fighting! 5 Stars!!!!!!!!!!! I would give it 7, but I can't!"
1,It might be a good game.,"This might be a fun game, I honestly don't know and I will never find out. When my roomate rented this game I couldn't get passed the annoying sound track. What idiotic game developer decided that there was hard rock in Imperial China? And if there was, who decided that it was such stupid, glaringly bad hard rock? Every time that someone in the house played this game the music made me want to destroy the disk. I don't know if there's an option to turn down the music on this game, but I didn't want to find out, the music is so bad that the very thought of taking time to play the game made me ill. So, in short this game is cool in theory, but in practice I find it almost impossible to get past the banal ""Heavy Metal"" sound track. Shame on KOEI for expecting people to swallow such tripe!"
3,A good introduction...,"As an Aikido student I was looking for a reference guide for katas and exercises so that I could practise outside the dojo. This book does not provide complex single katas ( it only has two very basic ones )so I was disappointed in that respect, however I did find the various introductory articles very educational and certianly relevant to any martial art whether you are trainig with a sword, a staff, or are doing empty handed techniques. My advice is: buy the book ad keep in mind Mr. Lowry's advice at all times but don't expect a visual feast of amazing pictures ( they are just plain black and white ). If you take this book as an introduction you will like it and hopefully it will push you to train harder and find out more about Japanese swordsmanship."
4,A good book for fundamentals-and attitude.,"I was prepared to be disappointed-but was pleasantly surprised. I have studied the sword for years, and yet learned something from this book. For a beginner, too, its clear, concise explanations, coupled with well thought out photographs, will prove an excellent study guide or workbook. There are minor deficiencies, occasionally, but they will provide the student an incentive to put down the book and physically explore what Lowry is trying to demonstrate.There are few like Musashi, who need little personal instruction. This book is not a substitute for a good teacher, but an excellent adjunct to one. The Way is not a set of rules. It is only the Way."
2,Typical introductory fare,For those who don't know what to do with a sword. It covers the very preliminary basics (of the Yagyu style) in pictures.
1,One of the worst books on the sword I have ever seen.,This book was horrible. The photographs were of very low quality and the explanation of technique was dubious at best. I was shocked at seeing an average of 5 stars on amazon from other readers.
3,"If you've gotten this far, your a true Bjork fan.","Bjorks band, Tappi Tikarrass only appears in this double cd set twice. The two songs she appears in aren't bad. I couldn't stomach the rest of the songs on it but its definitly something true Bjork fans need. If you like KUKL, you'll like Tappi Tikarass. Finish off your collection with this album."
4,These work much better than the cheap ones,I used these on my shelving project and things went really well. You pay a bit more up front but then the bits last a lot longer and you have less interruptions like having to run up town and buy another cheap bit. You cant go wrong with these.
2,Hard work,"I used theses drills with a dewalt 970 hammer drill, and it was very difficult to drill through bricks"
3,Maybe it can not use with high speed drilling with PC650HD,"After first several minutes with this bit set with Porter-Cable PC650HD with high speed drilling, the 3/8 drill bit's tip broke. The rest of bit still works and drill another hold in concrete. Maybe it can not use with high speed."
4,Like it,I like most of the Items that i Purchased and use most of them have not used the drill set yet
5,High quality,"This is a mechanical metronome ... no batteries ... and does a geat job. The ""tick rock"" is very audible and seems to run forever on a couple of small key winds."
4,A good book for little fans of Blue and who like to open and close.,"I have a little guy that enjoys opening and closing just about everthing and who also likes Blue, so he really enjoys this book. I think that he is a little young for the content, he is 18 months, but it will be a book that he can grow with. For anyone with a little person at home that enjoys Blue's Clues, this is a good book at a good price!"
3,ok,"I'm not a big fan of these books, but my daughter really enjoyed this book, if not for the story, for the lift the flaps and my improvisation of the story. I don't think this will ever be a classic, nor a story that has any content. But it definitely has that 'Blue' appeal that infants and toddlers love."
3,A Little Disappointed,"First of all - it's a good product. I was a little disappointed to the fact that my son did not play with it very much. It wasn't because of the item itself - he has moved to ""Blue's Clues"" to everything has to be ""Thomas and Friends"". So if your child is really interested in Blue's Clues - then I would highly recommend getting it."
4,Cute book,I thought this was a cute book and my son seemed to like the pictures. My son is 2 and I am not sure he was able to get all the comcepts of the book but perhaps later on?
5,This is a kick-butt game,"Samurai Warriors is a game about a ancient war over land and control. You play as a variety of generals and commanders. My favorte a ninja named Hanzo. You can also use alot of weapons and earn some cool moves. What I'm trying to get at is this game is a KICK-BUTT war game. If you know what I mean.Pros: Many Weapons, Lots of Missions, A Variety of Characters To Pick From, Cool Movies, 2 Endings, Good Graphics, Best of All is You Can Ride Horses and good Multiplayer.Con: Horable Voices (Some girls sound like men), Have to share the special bar, Stupid AI and Not that many places to go to."
5,A Successful gift,"I got this ferret beanie baby for my boyfriend for our anniversary. He wants a pet ferret, and since I could not get him a live ferret, I thought this would be a cute substitute. He greatly enjoyed receiving it, we just haven't figured out a name for him yet. xD"
5,Perfect puff to use with the Indian earth. Makes application so easy,"Love this product, I have used it time and again, it's stood the test of time, always first class, always makes applying the Indian earth or blusher so effortless ."
2,ok book,"I thought this book would be very funny. It was in parts but I got bored with it very quickly. I liked the idea of a romance with a djinn(genie) but I just didn't think the characters were very interesting. I would have liked to have read more about the djinn Jim. About his past assignments, what life is like as a djinn when he's not granting wishes. It seemed to focus more on the heroine, Meredith and her career. I would have liked to see him do a bit more mischief that he seemed to imply was the way of the djinn. I just wish, sorry about the pun, that this story had had more substance and that I hadn't gotten bored with it so soon."
3,takes little getting use to,"for overall fun its ok, but its takes a little getting use to the game play but overall its entertaining"
4,its ok......,the first major problem with this game is that its cool that you can have spies and stuff like that but every time you send them somewhere they get caught like right away. and you can capture an officer and try to hire him its hard to capture him. you have to all these tactics and combos to get him. another thing is that for one of the campains the wu one all of there officers suck. they are all mostly bowmen. and you have to spend a lot of gold trying to make them better. overall its a fairly good game to buy for really big fans of the dynasty series.
1,BOO!!!!!!!!!,this game stnks! the graphics are horrible! All you do is walk around and do errands! It's sooooo boring. I wish I could rate it a 0 {zero}
3,OK game,I heard this game is OK. It is not neary as good as the books. I wouldnt get this game if i were you. All you do is make inventions to get away from Count Olaf. I dont even think this game has that good graphics. Read the books they are much better. I rated this game as a 3 stars because it is harible.
5,Fun game,This is one of the best games ever. You get to play as all the children and use all of them to do stuff. You mostly play as violet because she can shoot apples and invent stuff. You hve to go through the 3 books witch are filled with hard stuff witch is fun! Even if you don't read the books you fill like this game for the hard stuff and fun stuff. You meet different characters from the books and have to dodge the amimals and Count Olafs's work men you you will lose life points. I just got a sp and this is a great new game to play it also has easy contorls and you will use this game alot. I am still in the vent in Olfs's kitchen and my friend loves playing this game too! So if you are looking for some fun game choose this game!
3,exciting game but hard to figure out along the way,This game lacks alot of information on how to play each book of the game. You need background of the books or movie to follow along and know what you are doing. It's basically trial and error and figure out what you need to make inventions and such along the way. The booklet is not much help but once you have insight on the plot (thank you movie!!!) then you can do better in the game.
4,"great game, but frustrating end","I enjoyed the game, Its a little challanging, but not very much... That is untill the end... Theres a character, the hook handed man, thats more challanging to beat... and you have to beat him three times... Takes a lot of pataince... so if you dont like doing things over and over not the game for you... But over all it was great game, plus at then end you get to go back and collect all the butterflies you missed and the book pages for the challanges"
4,Excellent source for expressing gratitude creatively.,"The book was so helpful for volume 'thank you' writing. I especially liked the specific people it addressed, the advice on making each note personal, and the ediquette!! This makes a nice, inexpensive gift for any bride-to-be."
3,Just OK,"There is nothing in this book that isn't reviewed by a larger, all encompassing etiquette book. It seemed like the suggestions didn't acknowledge the widely popular use of bridal registries. ""Thank you for the crystal vase. It's just what we wanted."" ...well obviously, if that's what you had registered for initially, right? It does, however, address some unusual situations. Fair content. Nothing special."
4,This Book is a MUST Have,"When I bought this book I had no idea how much it was really going to come in handy. I couldn't have begun to write all of my thank you letters without the help of this book. I took a combination of each of the example letters to create my own. After just a few thank yous out of the way the rest became more and more easy to write. I can't recommend this book enough.Cons -There could have been more example letters and for more practical gifts as some of the examples where a little outdated, but overall this book is a very big help."
1,truth in advertising?,"Uh, it would be really nice if Amazon would show which artists are included on albums before you bought them."
2,..Whatever idiot named this..?,"..has no conception of the genre..cherry pick & burn to one cd..then put your favorites on a disc 2..don't forget a couple of Slim Harpo tracks..& Sonny Boy Williamson's Little Village..were he has heated argument with Phil Chess before recording starts..Phil says the song has nothing to do with a village..Sonny Boy snaps back..Well, Alright, gd it.. Call it what chu want..Call it your mammy if you want to..!..Rice Miller was a character..even that was'nt his real name."
2,bulky,Nice ideal but to small and bulky for me..used it to cook friedchicken breasts.Handle is to short needs to be a bit longer.That may make it a better rating for me. Maby someone else might like it.
2,excellent but...,"Excellently produced, it suffers from small print and inferior paper. Obviously this is why such a modest price point could be set, but for people without perfect eyesight, add the cost of a magnifying glass."
2,A survey of ancient Gaza,"This is a work by a distinguished authority on late antiquity, in particular the cities of the East, such as Antioch, but I found it rather disappointing. We do not really know much about Gaza, and he pads it out with extraneous material. He is also rather too sympathetic to the Christians for my liking, They really behaved pretty badly."
4,Does the job,"I bought this shock to replace the stock KYB Gas shocks on my 2006 Isuzu D-Max Crew Cab pickup. As this is a US made shock, hence no Monroe-Matic Plus application for the Thai-built Isuzu exists online, I had to select it using Monroe's Shock Fitment chart using extended and compressed dimensions and end-types. The shock works very well, providing good damping with decent control whilst reducing vibration noise from the bed. It's slightly shorter than the standard shock, but the slightly increased pressure compensates nicely, giving a nice ride along with slightly better handling especially with aftermarket wheels.So far I am quite happy with them as they seem perfectly suited as a replacement shock."
4,Breaking Legs = Breaking Hit,"The Family would like to express its most sincere thanks for depecting us in the favorable manner in which we are so highly regarded..... in utter words, nice job.The cast of charactors in this creation come to life as Professor Terrance comes to ask for funding for his newly written play. Everyone from Mike and Lou, Tino and Angie try their way with Terry's literary masterpiece - thank Goodness they leave out the fat acordian player.Tom Dulacks' work is a great comedy that can be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of humor.... Exactly the phrase I was lookin' for...Thumbs Up!"
5,"Great, Helpful Book!!! Reccomend to all","I thought this book was absoultly great! It was so helpful. Easy to read, gets right to the point. I read the book just before i started searching for a job. And it helped me Tremendusly in nailing the job i wanted. Great for people just entering the work force and great for people that are looking to brush up on there skills, and learn how to get the new job they are after. Before searching for a job this is a must read!..Enjoy"
2,A must NOT have.,"For a $13 paperback, you're not getting your money's worth. I read the book in just over an hour during a meeting. I found little of the information new and insightful. If you went to college, you already know all of this. Even high school grads who have taken business or interview prep courses already know all of this. If you have not taken an interview prep course or read an article on interview prep then this may be for you. Just ignore all the errors in grammar as apparently no one proof read this book."
3,A so-so game,Its a pretty good game. The grafics are good but the levels are short but some are levels are fun.I would not buy it if you are reading my reviw.
3,entertainment,"It is entertaining, but for some reason its hard to see - the cat is small some areas are more fun other areas are a pain. But just kept on to finish a level. Would I purchase this again, or had I rented this before purchase would I buy it? no"
1,Puss in Boots still has a LONG way to go....,"Okay, first thing's first. This game is EXTREMELY short. I was able to get to the final level in about an hour. An HOUR. Without collecting the coins, this game is ridiculous. Some of the levels are fun, most are annoying. Plus, Puss doesn't listem to you. If you were thinking about buying this, think again."
5,My daughter loves it,My daughter loves dogs and this little ones is her fav and always goes with her. She loves all the TY products.
2,Some of the episodes skip alot and I can't even watch a couple of them.,A lot of the episodes skip alot. I can't even watch a lot of them because it skips so bad.
1,Very poor quality,"When I ordered this series and received it , they seemed to be brand new in cases plastic wrapped. I think I got ripped off though because the quality is very fuzzy and seems to be something bootleg perhaps ?? Not sure where these came from but I am quite disappointed for the money I spent"
4,Awesome Show,"My son got me hooked on this show and now I can't get enough of it. I absolutely love watching it. I only gave this four stars instead of five because of the quality of the reproduction. As a couple of other reviewers have pointed out, it's like these are bootlegged DVDs. The video quality is very subpar - almost VHS like, if you can remember those days. The amazon streaming that I was doing prior to this purchase was actually much better quality."
5,Awesome!,"Dexter is one of my favorite shows of all time. Getting to buy them all in a set on blu-ray was something I could not pass up. The disks were all in perfect condition, and arrived on time and well packaged. The show is amazing, progressing steadily from season to season. It is well written, well paced, and brilliantly acted and directed. I would highly recommend it to anyone, as long as they do not have a problem with blood (it is about a serial killer after all)."
3,Dexter DVDs Season 1-6,"Some of the DVD's won't play at all. I've tried cleaning them, also tried seeing if they'd work in a different DVD player, but it doesn't help."
4,The most intense Star Wars game to date!,"Me and my friends have lost hours of sleep playing this incredible game. This is one of the most intense games I have played. Will YOU like it? Well, you first have to like the concept of Demolition Derby. If you do, you'll at least like it. You'll like it even more if you like Star Wars. This game makes some of the Star Wars dreams come true. Where else will you see Darth Maul (who is a hidden character that I've unlocked) and Boba Fett battle each other? As such, this game isn't very fun if you play alone. You MUST be playing against friends. Pick this one up if you're looking for a great party game and turn the sound up!!"
1,Major disappointment,"The creators of V8 and V8 2nd Offense could do so much better. Your primary laser weapon doesn't track targets well, surroundings don't react to being hit with serious firepower, and the bonus weapon selection is terrible. Most graphics are great, but battle action is hard to follow. Nothing will aim properly; every shot is a miss. The graphics for the weapon launches and explosions are beyond awful. Steer clear of this one."
3,good,"decent rip off of the Twisted Metal series....BUT, there are memorable characters!!say it with me.... WADE VOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Game Play is TERRIBLE - Disappointing,"This game has some of the worst game play action I have seen in a long time. Although the quality of Graphics and Sound are good, the quality of this game is not what you would expect to play on a new 128-bit system - more like back in the fist Nintendo 8-bit days. You will get sick of this one real quick. Don't listen to the hype of those pumping this one - there is no way you'll lose hours of sleep."
1,Did they send me the wrong game this is vigelanty 8,Gimme a break. This game was fun the first time I played it when it was called vigelanty 8. No imagination needed for these programers change a few lines in the code to replace the automobiles with Star Wars vehicles and send it out. Thanks for nothing.
2,strong smell,This stuff didn't work for me. I'm transitioning from relaxed to natural and was looking for something to smooth my edges down. maybe if my hair wasn't as thick it could have worked. DO NOT! rub this directly onto your hair because it will pull out your hair. I used a tooth brush or a hairbrush to apply it. It doesn't stink but has a strong smell.
4,Good hair Wax for Men,"Been using this for years, works well for shorter haircuts. Very little needed and 1 stick last a long time, check different versions of this on Amazon as Prices vary by vendor."
2,Tancho Tique Stick,"It works well on my hair, but something in it gives me a small alergic reaction..."
5,Nice quality bed.,"This bed is GREAT for the price. The wood quality is good, all items needed were in the box. Delivery was quick.Setting up was easy, instructions were easy to follow. I love this bed!!"
2,Poor quality item.,"I bought this bed for my 2 children. It ""looked"" great. It was beautiful actually. Within less than one year, the bottom wood beam split in two. From that point on, one thing after the other started to break off that bed. I had no choice but to throw the entire thing away. This can all be traced back to the quality of the wood. The wood was of very poor quality. Screws easily stripped it, and entire beams would crack under barely any weight/pressure."
4,An outstanding book . . .,". . . that suffers only in comparison to its predecessor, I Stink (about a garbage truck). Buy that one first, then try this one, which is rich in illustration and story line but not as engaging or complex in attitude as I Stink."
4,Great kids book,I'm Mighty and I Stink are great books. I have two girls and even they loved them.Nice product
4,Not quite as good as I Stink,"This book isn't as good as it's predecessor, I Stink, but it's hard to live up to that!I will note that people who dislike the attitude of the garbage truck in I Stink will prefer this book - the tugboat is proud but not boastful, and altogether sweet and charming. And there's no puppy poo!"
4,Goot!,I agree with the previous post. It gives a nice golden shade on pale blondies. We'll see how long it lasts. The best part is that it's very gentle on scalp. I'll be purchasing this product again:)
3,not as part one,"nice anime but not good as part one you'll get bored quickly ,plus it's very over priced ."
5,"it is wat it said it is, the best vampire anime ever",i love this series it comes with a hat that has the blood+ logo on it and a small preview of the manga
1,Do not buy this...........! -Jultwarfell,Between this and part 1 I lost over 600 + minutes of my life having to watch this crap. What a waste for dub talented actors. Jult Warfell
4,Good Buy,"The watch is great, but the band was too short and not sturdy. Purchased a band, and wear the watch every day."
1,skip it.,"You seen one episode you seen them all. Dog and crew chase small time criminals and get their friends and family to rat them out. Dog calls the criminal scum and claims that he is fighting the war on ice, but keeps bailing drug dealers out of jail even after they jumped bond on him. Anything for a buck I guess."
4,Looking Like the Enemy: My Story of Imprisonment in Japanese American Internment Camps,"What can I say? It's ""THE DOG"" if you love the family then you will love the DVD. Actually better than the first one."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Mary Trimble has hit the nail on the head with her insightful book, ""Rosemount"". I bought copies for all of my friends - with and without children. Trimble has a knack for knowing the thoughts of a teenager. This is a must read! Curl up with a cup of steaming cocoa and a nice fire, plan to stay a while as you won't be able to put the book down! Two thumbs up!"
1,Driftwood Valley is better.,"There is no joy in this book. Not a redeeming sentence. I lived in Fairbanks for two years and I am glad I never met this family. They critize others for doing the same thing they did to their land i.e. ""rape it"". There are a lot better books than this about living in the North. Driftwood Valley is one of the best."
3,Amazing they all survived!,"I have read many true story accounts of wilderness ""Alaska Bush"" living, but this one truly had me wondering how this family kept avoided being killed or dying from the unbelievable danger they continued to put themselves in. I found it interesting to read, but at the same time, almost painful. Living in Alaska, I see many, many adventure seekers who think they can make it in the bush without the necessary skills and knowledge it takes to survive on their own. It is truly a miracle that this family, although brave, all survived their experience."
4,I learned a lot about Homesteading in general...,"Enjoyed this book about homesteading in the back country of Alaska, and I learned what some of my own family members may have experienced in the past. It was more of a story of relationships rather than facts, but a good combo of both all in all. I didn't understand why some of the characters behaved as they did, but learning of the hardships and drama that was forced on them made me respect them. A fairly short read, a little monotonous in places, but overall I recommend anyone interested in what homesteading in the backwoods is like, to give it a read."
5,A True Alaskan Homesteader,"We also moved to Alaska shortly after the Cobbs. It was so exciting when we found out they lived here also, as my brother, Bob, went to High School with Les Cobb. This story reads like fiction, but I know it is real, and real exciting. READ THIS BOOK!"
5,the last of the pioneers,"if you thought that the last of the ""true pioneer"" tales had been told before the 1900's you should read this modern day story of a woman and her family who yearns for their own piece of land to call home. although it starts out more like the Joads in ""grapes of wrath"", this true story holds you with amazing adventure as well as the warmth of the family facing the harshness of poverty and severity of Alaska's wilderness. although a cautionary tale for anyone who has shared Norma Cobb's dreams, it is ultimately a tale of the triumph of the human spirit, and a testimony of her faith in God.i found their encounters with the ""hairy man"" to be convincing, you might too."
1,"""he is worthless as usual"" Norma Cobbs writes about her son","I did not enjoy this book as much as I had hoped. I found Norma Cobbs to be critical of those who have not lived this type of lifesyle or owned a certain type of dog or of those who are well educated. While being so judgemental of others she finds a way to twist and defend her husband for breaking the law. For someone who does all the right things in life she had no problem spending dirty money that her husband made illegally.One of her statements shocked me, while discribing her son, she wrote ""he is worthless as usuual"". Shocking! This was not a heartwarming story. I found it to be written by a selfish woman who dragged five very young children around to persue her dream and did nothing other than complain while telling her miserable story."
4,Enjoyable story.,I found the book a good read and interesting. This book gives you insight on how the pioneers endured life while homesteading.
4,Artic Tundra,"Good story that keep the reader interested, as there is always something new happening to this family. For those who thought getting land for free (homesteading) in Alaska by working the property and improving it, this book will open you eyes to the DARK truth of homesteading in Alaska..BIG FOOT LIVES.."
3,Enough god already,"Lots of interesting stories about life in Alaska, but the repetition of this kind of sentiment becomes annoying:""God tested us, found us worthy, and was now blessing us."" Norma is portrayed as the ""last woman pioneer,"" but note that she admits cheating (backdating the forms) to achieve this status. Although the journey starts in 1973, a time when hippies were trying to go back to the land all over the country, the Cobbs are rednecks, not hippies, which contributes to or detracts from the narrative, depending on your perspective."
3,Enjoyable read,"An enjoyable read on the plane back home...The elements of getting to Alaska, while important framework for the story, seemed to drag on! The homestead was the reading I wanted!Other parts seemed a little far fetched with the stories. It's always interesting to read some of the drama that people escaping to Alaska to build a new life bring. That drama also can get a little weird."
3,"Okay,",Not worth the price. It started out better than it ended. It Felt like the author didn't know how to end it
5,Great Book,"If you're looking for a well-written captivating book - look no further. This book will only last you a couple days or less. The flow of the book allows the reader to quickly get amerced in the personal voyage of the writer and when you come up for air, the book is over."
5,good bit,These are good quality roto bits. I use it for concrete and haven't had a problem yet. Won't work well in non-rotary hammers.
5,Urban Knights III,"I loved this CD! It has spirit and imagination! I own the Urban Knights trilogy and I must admit that this is their best effort yet! Their debut CD lured me in, this third CD will keep my attentions focused! If you like contemporary jazz, you'll love this CD!"
3,A pleasant surprise...,If you enjoyed the first two UK CD's you wont regret buying this one!CD highlights:You're The One For MeThe GypsyStrung OutI'm Not In Love
4,COLD IN THE EARTH - A very good read!,"This review is for ""Cold in the Earth."" Even though I suspected the killer, it didn't diminish my enjoyment in the reading. The characters are dimensional and so well drawn. The dialogue is excellent, even with the Scottish terms I didn't quite understand. She descriptions paint visual pictures of the people and the area which build tension and suspense in the plot. Her writing is described as atmospheric, and it is. This is the first book I've read by Templeton, but it only took a few pages to decide it won't be the last."
4,Kind of scary!,"I do scare quite easily and this one scared me quite a lot. A very skillfully written, intriguing mystery it is!"
3,So So...,Purchase the RotoZip as an additional tool in my arsenal of tools. It does a reasonable job but I have had problems with removing the tools and the batter life is not so good... but still reach for it when I am in a difficult place and need a cordless cutoff device
5,Great Movie!,"Great classic basketball flick...before SpaceJam....there was The Fish. Doc is the best! This movie shipped fast and with no basketball this season, you better stock up on your basketball movies."
4,Old School,This is an old school classic. Most older movies like this that come from tape are grainy and very poor quality but not this one. It is excellent quality kinda made me feel like I was in that movie theater once again. Worth buying for any movie collection.
4,"Great Movie, but...","This movie is a classic, and some of us do remember the original version. Although I loved the movie (now and back when it first came out), I was not too happy to find so many crucial scenes missing. I didn't see the need to remove the scenes, or how the editors thought no one would notice. The movie itself is inspiring and encourages one to dig deeper within themselves. It is also very entertaining and the music is great. Despite the editing flaws, I would still recommend."
3,Good nostalgic family film,"My mother took my brother and me to see this at the movies. In the 70's there were so few positive movies for African-American children. As an adult, I had searched and searched for it, and, fortunately my husband found it and purchased it for me for my birthday.To be sure, the plot isn't strong, but it doesn't have to be--it's got Dr. J (and a host of other 70's/80's basketball stars), Debbie Allen and the Sylvers! If you're at least 30, you can watch it and reminisce. If you have children they can watch it, too, since it doesn't have profanity or sex. And, its a story about the underdog overcoming adversity and the low expectations of others to succeed."
2,Stupid movie,"Even my little boy, the one we got this for, who loves basketball thought this was a very stupid movie."
3,"A very, very cheesy movie.","Once upon a time in 1979, there was a pittsburgh team that was not...so...good. But then, a boy (James Bond III, not to be confused with the fictional character) meets a female astrologer and turns those Phythons into the Pisces. Every time a home team scores, a sound effect is heard, very cheesy. Also, look for basketball players past and present when that year the movie came out. I saw it on ESPN Classic, but i liked it!"
2,Makes me nostalgic for my youth,"I remember seeing this on Thanksgiving Day, and sitting through three screenings. My mother had to come in the theater to get me and my cousin. We missed Thanksgiving dinner AND ""Welcome Back Kotter"".Oh, the movie itself. I loved it as a kid. Now...well, I have to say it's stupid. BUT I will put it in the VCR from time to time for kicks.Maybe they can remake this film with the cooperation of the NBA, and maybe put Shaq or (ugh) Michael in the role of Moses...Oh forget it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO UNLESS WARNER HAS FIXED IT!,"Please do not purchase any copies of Fish, unless Warner Bros. has fixed & re-released this video the right way, the original way it was released on video. Warner bought the video rights from Karl Lorimar video, kept the same box with Lorimar's name on it & released the video edited, the same version Turner puts on his station (Hmmm. Turner=Time Warner) This movie was not released by Lorimar like this, there are a couple of scenes missing and the language(trash talking) is gone. It was a harmless PG movie that unless aired for television, was harmless in its original version, This saddens me that Warner would do this, so if Warner has fixed this problem, then great, TRADE ME! (like Tucker says) I want a copy of the original version, I have recorded the Lorimar version on video and my store bought Warner copy collects dust, I refuse to watch it. So there you have it, I'll stop rambling now.."
1,Basketball fails again in Pittsburgh,"This movie could have been the true life story of the Pittsburgh Pipers of the ABA. The Pipers suffered at the gates due to the competition with the Phantoms of the NASL and the Penguins of the NHL, who both entered pro-sports the same year the Pipers entered the ABA. It's a testiment to the un-popular sport of Basketball in Pittsburgh. The movies only saving grace is that is has to do with Pittsburgh."
5,If You Love MUSIC and CATS This Is The Book For You.,"Wow! I was amazed how great and useful this book was. It includes 19 songs of Cats Classics. Most every song is written just like Andrew Lloyd Webber did himself. It also includes pictures from various Cats casts through out the years. If you are a theater buff, and enjoy being up on stage, then this is a great audition book. With songs like Memory, Skimbleshanks, Gus:The Theatre Cat, Mr. Mistoffeles, and many others. It will leave you at the piano for hours playing away. When of the best things about this is that it is the COMPLETE book of songs from the musical. I highly recommend this, and I hope you will enjoys this as much as I did."
2,Why?,"Why? ...Words, Lover's Prayer, To Love Somebody...why? I was pleased to hear Juliet again but resinging Barry's leads is a mistake. Would have loved to hear the brothers together doing a tribute album to Mo instead. When I look at this album, all I can say is ""Why?"""
1,Bee Gee Fan for life can't listen to this.,"I have been a fan of the Bee Gees for over 30 years and I was shocked to see this album released. I was even more shocked to listen to the vocals. They are dead and uninspired, no bee gee magic, just Robin in a monotone. Why Robin would ever release this is beyond me. The shawdows of the harmony and magic of the past is too large for Robin alone to fill. I would post highlights but there are none. Please Robin go back with Barry and return to the magic."
1,WHERE ARE YOU VOICE ROBIN????????,"THIS CD IS A PIECE OF SHEET ,, HEY ROBIN!!!,, YOU STOLEN MY MONING,,,,I'M FAN THE BEE GEES,,,BUT WHAT IS THAT!!!!,,,OOOHHHROBIN DON'T LOOSE YOUR MIND"
1,Pure Crap!,"I am a HUGE Bee Gees AND was a Robin Gibb fan until ""Magnet"" came out. Now this travesty of a recording makes me ill. Robin sounds terrible singing songs made famous by Barry and the rochestra could have used a little more practice and a really good sound engineer (you can barely hear Robin sometimes and when you do, it's several octaves lower). Where is ""I Started A Joke"" and ""And The Sun Will Shine""? I hope Mr. Gibb does something worthwhile again, because since our beloved Maurice left us, all we have is rehashed garbage."
1,What In God's Name???,"Robin Gibb preforming Barry Gibb vocals is ludicrous! Can you imagine Barry Gibb singing, ""I Started A Joke""? The orchestra is so loud and muddied that you can't even hear Gibb's vocals most of the time and they are weak at best. His last album, ""Magnet"" was a horrible disappointment and now this. I can't wait for Barry Gibb's Streisand album to come out. Robin should be producing others as well and not trying to continue the terrible loss of the Bee Gees."
5,I LOVE IT!,I GOT ROBIN LIVE CD TODAY AND I LOVE IT ROBIN HAS A WONDERFUL SINGING VOICE THE ONLY SONG I DIDN'T LIKE ROBIN SINGING IS HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE HIS VOICE IS TOO WEAK ON IT!ROBIN ROCKS!!!!!FROM A BIG ROBIN GIBB FAN FOR 15 YEARS NOW KIRSTEN
1,where is my wonderful BeeGees?,"ohhh what a terrible mess this cd is, it breaks my heart. My favorite group is the BeeGees and the orchestra is so beautiful but together it is not music. On his own, Robin doesn't do too well. He needs at least one brother to harmonize with. The orchestra here is sounding like it is trying to drown Robin out. All comes across sounding awful."
4,Psychologically interesting,"As I read this book, I felt that the author's fictionalized approach did yield an intersting psychological portrait."
4,"Fun, Tabloid-Style Read Lacks Editing","I found this book difficult to put down. I thought the author did a good job of getting inside Marilyn's head and interweaving known facts and conversations with what she may have been feeling and thinking. It is written like a diary, which may be bothersome to some readers, as it appears to jump around a bit in time.It is a fun and easy tabloid-style read. I found the misspelled words and lack of editing very annoying, however, thus my four star rating. Nevertheless, it was worth reading for me and I would recommend it to anyone interested in MM who wants a quick and interesting book to read. This is the first book I've read on Marilyn -- quite a fascinating woman, to say the least!"
1,if you really want to know the truth behind the image it's not here,truth is in here i am mother the real story of marilyn monroe by nancy miracle see www.marilynmonroefoundation.com it changes everything and reveals the real story for those who really want it
5,THE one to buy if looking for a Colonial War ancestor,"While the title sounds snooze provoking, the information within is hardly that. This supplement contains the most detailed listing of ancestors compiled by the society up to 1941. While they aren't full biographies of ancestors they do include years of birth and death and what their service (military or civilian) was. I expected to find a few ancestors in here and instead came up with several hundred throughout my various family lines. There's no little information regarding the society or its activities, but then again, that's not the point of this particular title. This is a MUST have for genealogists looking for an ancestor who provided colonial service!"
5,Scary double standard,"Amidst many informative and entertaining pages about Annapolis, Prof. Fleming reveals two very shocking facts. One: About 50% of midshipmen do not meet the USNA minimum academic requirements, but are let in anyway, because of perceived needs in athletics and affirmative action. Two, clearly unqualified midshipmen, even those with serious psychological disablities, are allowed to graduate and assume potentially disastrous command positions because to prevent their graduation would reflect badly on the decision to admit them in the first place. Sounds like Catch 22, but it is unfortunately not fiction. There may be some broader social value in weighing factors other than character and ability in civilian schools, but in the military, I would think we would want the very best making command decisions, and not someone there for any other reason. When war is upon us, and lives are at stake, does anything else really matter?"
5,Now I understand!,"I have a female mid at the Academy and this book has really opened my eyes and allowed me to see things from a totally different perspective. I think I understand her better now and what she is experiencing. Bruce Fleming is a tad cynical but so many of his thoughts are very thought provoking and important to read. Take the time to sit with it, don't pre-judge and just think about what is said. One can not forget that these are HIS thoughts and we need not agree with everything. Nonetheless, there are some things in the book that bear consideration but to do so, we must take off our blinders and step out of our 'comfort zone'...... I recommend you give it a try."
1,Awful Annapolis Autumn,"This is just a terrible book. Poorly written, and filled with mush. No wonder the USNA is producing a bunch of politically correct graduates who do everything they can to get out of actually serving as a warrior. Don't waste your money on this--and think twice about sending your child to a school that could employ this touchy-feely teacher of mumbo-jumbo.Jim Webb's ""A Sense of Honor"" is still the best book about what the Naval Academy USED to be. This things reads like it was written by a flower child from Woodstock."
3,Misleading Intro,"I expect this to be a very useful book...and I look forward to trying a few of the projects. However, right from the start I find some misleading disappointments.From the Intro chapter I quote: ""If you own a table saw and a few fundamental hand tools, you'll do just fine."" And then the very first project calls for a router, drill press, band or jig saw and a lathe. Sorry, but most medium-equipped work shops don't include a lathe.Also, the Intro chapter presents five examples of ""typical trestle tables"" yet only the last project is in the trestle style, and it appears rather difficult...again calling for a lathe.How about some honesty in the Intro section...as presented in the ""Search Inside"" found on the web page?"
4,It's for your kids,Saw this on cable. This doc effects my grand kids. I'm glad I won't be around for the holy crap they will face. Do yourself and the youth a favor and teach the lessons here. Maybe someone will step up and be counted.
3,Good compared to other bands...not so good for Altan.,"This is perhaps my least favorite Altan album -- the selections of ballads are a little weak, and don't play to what I see as the band's strengths. Of the instrumentals, the set of slip jigs is the best bit on the album, but it hardly compares to the worst parts of such gems as Harvest Storm, Island Angel, and Red Crow. Really, the main criticism is that there are only four instrumental tracks on the album, one a waltz and one a slow air; for those seeking stirring reels and jigs, you won't find that here."
1,Too Bad!,"This is the Third edition. In the Second edition someone made the decision to remove all ""outdated"" terms making the book worthless for historic and genealogical researchers."
5,Love em,"Bought the wax pot a while back so i was just re placing the wax strips I had used. They work great.Leave a little bit of string and lint behind after use, but nothing a little bit of wax remover or baby oil wont take right off!"
5,Best Concert DVD I own!,"This band is amazing! If you have never heard of Derek Trucks Band, buy this DVD! It is the perfect introduction to his music and incredible band. The musicianship of this group is beyond fantastic! No flash pods, lasers, or purple hair...just killer music being played by grownups. Recommend! Buy it! 6 stars out of 5!"
5,Excellent...,This band rocks no doubt. Excellent presentation - widescreen / dolby. Made for HDTV's.......
2,Not that great,I watched Derek Trucks on the Crossroads DVD and fell in love with the song; 'Midnight in Harlem'. After reading the reviews on here I figured this would be a great concert but it wasn't.I must agree that his lead singer is terrible! This guy does not have the sound I like nor does he blend in with this band. This band has talent but they will never go far with this guy having lead vocals! I have a large collection of DVD concerts but I don't see this one being played much.
4,no SKY,Its great stuff i love the band the only thing i dont understand is why they did not incoled the song Sky a wonderful tune but not on the DVD on the CDzbut not the DVD.
1,Singer gives me a headache,"Dereck Trucks plays a mean slide guitar but my g@d, he needs to get rid of his vocalist. The guy is a one note screech....its like the king with no clothes, no one will tell him that his singing is like violently scratching the chalk board. He sends shivers up my spine. Also most of Dereck's tunes are like a warm up to hopefully something better than its sum parts but it never goes anywhere. I am always waiting for some type of groove, it don't happen. Derck, go back to being a supporting player for better known groups. Please."
4,"The Part of Allman Brothers Band make music, yet.....","... but not sufficiently, not like other guitarists..."
4,it's cool to see Trucks roll,"hey what do i know ? bring the lights down,,yea,and get a different lead singer..you do what you can..gracias.rico"
5,Stop Male pattern baldness,"Saw Palmetto blocks testosterone from forming DHT, dihydro-testosterone,which causes male-patterned balness and BPH, benign prostate hypertrophy. It is something every adult male should take. I have been taken it for twenty years or so and I have all my own hair and no problems with BPH( BTW, I'm 60 years old). You'll find it in all vitamins formulated for adult men for a reason. There might not be enough to be effective in your multi-vitamin, however.Gunner May 2,007"
3,Saw Palmetto,"I am a female so I didn't take them for my (nonexistent) prostate. I took them to help with my hormones for my skin and hair loss and I didn't notice any difference from them, but they weren't terribly expensive, nor were there any ill side effects. I don't think this will help many people, considering the majority of humans who purchase these will be males."
1,Have not seen any difference.,I used the entire bottle and have not seen any difference yet.There are certain herbs that may take longer than 30 days to actually see the difference. I am giving it a one star based on the length of time I had it for which is 30 days only. I will purchase it again and continue using it for another month to see whether it will work or not.
4,GREAT OLD SONGS WITH LASTING VALUE,"I HAD HEARD A FEW OF THESE SONGS PLAYED ON PUBLIC RADIO AND REMEMBERED SOME FROM WHEN I WAS A BOY. I RECENTLY PLAYED THE DISC DURING A HISTORY DRIVING TOUR WITH MY 12 YEAR OLD GRANDSON. HE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED ""BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME"" AND ""ONE MEAT BALL'. IN FACT, HE ASKED ME TO REPLAY THE WHOLE DISC SEVERAL TIMES DURING OUR WEEKLONG TRIP. THOUGH THE SONGS DATE FROM 70 YEARS AGO, THEY ARE STILL PERTINENT TODAY. IN BETWEEN, WE LISTENED TO THE TEACHING COMPANY'S GREAT BOOK SERIES."
1,What the heck happened here?,"Although Mr. Jason's first book, The Ultimate Dragon, was a bit on the superficial side (no real depth to the characters), the story moved along well and the book was readable.I cannot say the same about this one. It lurches along in the present tense, which IMHO is totally unsuitable for an action/adventure/fantasy novel. The text is rife with grammatical and spelling errors and the dialogue is stilted and silly -- not to mention questionable in other ways. In an early scene, the hero & heroine's teenage daughter, observing her parents making out, sighs, ""Dad's caresses are so adept, so sensual..."" I'm sure the author did not mean to imply an incestuous relationship, but still...This book reads as if written by a completely different person than the first one. Perhaps dyslexia is not the author's only problem."
3,Does a fair job conditioning leather,"While this product does a fair job conditioning leather, I do not see its advantages over less-expensive conditioners."
3,"Ordered the cleaner, got the conditioner","I guess that is what happens when you have almost identical bottles for the same product. Used it on my boots and worked well, but obviously could not use to clean wife's purse which is what I was trying to accomplish."
1,This company is a scam. Don't purchase anything from them.,"I ordered a pair of Dark Copper Jane Tassels. I received a package labeled which said "" Pair of Burgundy and Gold Isabella Tassels. I bet they send the whatever the left over items that company has and hoping that customer won't return items since we don't want to spend money on return shipping on relatively cheap items like this. Don't deal with this company. I really hope Amazon will remove this company from this site."
2,Tedious beyond measure,"I took a course on comparative politics from Dr. Jacoby last year, in which sections of his book were required reading. Believe me, he does *not* lecture like he does in this book. His lectures and speeches are much, much better. The prose of his book is unimaginably dry and dense; I had to *force* myself to read it. No, truly--I would read a while, and then, I would have to put it down to keep my sanity.The subject of his book--the democratization of postwar Germany--is not at all dry or boring, but his presentation of it surely is. On the back cover is an accolade from some scholarly political science journal that I'd never heard of. Perhaps this book would be an enjoyable read for postdocs or Ph.Ds, but it was certainly madness for me and for and other undergraduates who had to read it."
4,"good metronome, bad color.","It's small and easy to move around. It works well with decent volume. A couple turns at a slower setting will more than last through a piece, even for a beginner such as myself, and it winds down quickly when dropped to the fastest setting. If you want an inexpensive metronome and prefer a mechanical clack to a digital beep, this is a good value.My only gripe is the actual color is much lighter than the picture and reminds me of the puke color of computer cases in the late '80s. I wish I'd chosen a different color, but it is a minor issue."
5,wittner 831 review,Bought it for my daughter for her piano lessons and it works great! I would recommend this product for beginners.
3,Okay read.,"Bought book, Wolf And Iron, for my son, one of his favorites. Story idea good, didn't care for writers style."
1,Don't judge Dickson by this work,"I have been a fan of Dickson's work for years. The Childe Cycle and the Dragon Knight series are both top notch. Wolf and Iron is slow paced and almost pointless. It is really a misplaced frontier adventure, with only a very thin veneer of ""SF.""I found myself skimming over whole chapters. How many pages of the hero nursing himself back to health after being attacked by a bear, then reinjuring his leg do you really need.If you want outdoor adventure, fine, read this book. If you want good science fiction steer clear."
2,Wake me when it's over,"YAAWWWNNNN!!!! Starts well enough, but slowly and methodically dribbles into a snooze fest. No action, no tension.... nothing. And the ending? I liked the way the author explained away the whole point of the book in the last pages. Dumb."
2,Fail,"I'm a big fan of post-apocalypse and the book started decently enough to get me interested, however after about midway it loses its sense of direction and lets down your expectations. The climax was just dull and the conclusion just pissed me off, because there was none. It seems like the author got tired and said ""alright thats good enough, the end""Pass on this."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A good old fashioned postapocalyptic United States of America type story.The place has collapsed for no real completely specified reasons, and a young man ends up on a trip across the middle.He picks up a lupine companion, and the detail of wolf life is definitely the most interesting part of the book.3 out of 5"
1,Not good at all,I have had to use this book and taken the class of one of the professors who wrote it. For the first few chapters the book is ok. It quickly goes downhill from there. Gives the feeling that they started out with a lot of enthusiasm for writing it but then got bored and just tried to get it done without any real thought on how to educate a reader.
5,Excellent buy from Farberware,"In my mind, nylon tools are definitely the way to go to preserve the life of your cookware. I worked at a department store in the Housewares department for several years and experienced first hand the destruction metal utensils can do to top of the line pots. Farberware is a name brand that is trusted and rightly so. This basting brush is well worth the money invested in it. It is made from a thick material that can resist high temperatures for a longer period of time without succumbing to the heat. Of course I don't recommend leaving any plastic or nylon utensil on a hot pot for any extended duration. But, if you dart off to answer the phone in the middle of preparing a meal, this utensil will not look like a spatula in a Dali painting. I've had mine for over a year now and it is holding up excellently. Bristles have yet to begin the gravitational plunge that occurs in many basting brushes when used and washed more than 10 times."
4,WWII at its best,"After beating Return to castle wolfenstein, it keft me wanting more hardcore WWII action. Call of Duty is the answer. Play from 3 point of views, the Russians, Americans, and English. The levels are filend with nonstop hardcore action. You get a great variety of guns and gameplay is excellent!"
4,A good combat video game,This is a very good combat video game. I share it with my family and all enjoy it.
2,This should not be called Call Of Duty,"This game should not be called call of duty. Instead, it shuold be called ""wait for the f**king tanks"". seriously you spend half of this game waiting for tanks to move ahead of you at 2mph. and then you get shot by a guy in a MG42 400 yards away that you cant even aim at. Then when you hide behind a rock or something, your tanks shoot you. Then you have to start all over and your 20 minutes of progress is shattered. Nice going tanks. I hate this game."
2,Junky,"I read some OK reviews about this game and played the PC demos, which were great, so I decided to try the xbox version. My mistake. It's a piece of junk! In most of the russian missions it's too dark to see anything! and i hate when you're in a tank because they are hard to control. plus the british missions are commando style while ppl seem to prefer big battles. i am so going for the pc version now"
2,One BIG flaw...,"Most of the complaints of this game are accurate but nitpicky... tanks are tough to control, AI isn't great, etc. The only thing that will keep you from enjoying this otherwise great game is the LACK OF CHECKPOINTS!!!!You will progress insanely far in a level only to be killed and start all over again! Every other aspect of the game is terrific - or at least forgivable, but playing the same sequence OVER and OVER again... it completely takes the fun out and is enough to keep this game on the shelf. If they don't change this in COD 2, don't buy either one."
2,Don't buy this game.,"This game is nothing like the Call of Duty for pc. There is no D-Day or running through Stalingrad. I remember trying to secure a building but I kept on getting killed by my own tanks. It has some of the worst A.I. that ive seen in a game. Every time the enemy shoots they seem to hit you even if you're crouching, running and sometimes even behind what seems to be perfectly safe cover. The Nazis charge at you like madmen. Shooting them in the stomach, legs, or other appendages should wound them but, oh yeah, they cant be wounded only killed. I gave the game two stars for the graphics and game designing. Its hard to believe that the best WWII FPS for pc would turn out to be one of the worst games for X-Box. This was by far my worst purchase ever.Get the PC version instead."
2,Your Call of Duty.... don't buy this x-box version,"Most of the reviews I've read sum it up. Something got lost in the transition from the PC to the X-Box. The A.I. is terrible, the multiplayer is terrible, various option selections are terrible, and the game itself is full of all sorts of wierd bugs and glitches. It's sad to see such an awsome PC game with such console potential wind up being the next sequel in the Medal of Honor series."
3,This game is very good,"This is a great game. The only thing that takes it down a little is that its dark all the time, not allowing you to explore the magnificient levels, taking some fun out of it.Otherwise, though, this game is very realistic, with great graphics, even if you can't appreciate them sometimes due to darkness. It is possibly the most realistic war game to come out with a lot of historical relevance. The good thing is that it is a good blend of the historical stuff and heroism barely possible to achieve in real life (you need a little of that in every war game). This game has an average selection of weapons, but you dont really need a huge variety of weapons to have fun with it.If your looking into it, buy this game, but if you are comparing it (or already have) call of duty 2, just get 2 and skip this one."
1,Too hard and slow,"I think that this Call of Duty was to hard and the gameplay was to slow. I didn't enjoy this game. I didn't have fun while playing this Call of Duty. I struggling to keep alive and make my objectives. Too hard for me atleast. Rent before buying this one, or play call of duty 2 big red one if you have just the original xbox and your looking for a call of duty."
1,Dont buy this game!,This game is the worst game I have ever played. The graphics look like yur playing on ps2 and the AI is really stupid. The commercials made this game look awsome but it is know where near awsome. [...]
1,Not worth the money,This game is not worth it! Frist of all this is not relistic. You have to shoot them so many times to kill them. Then its really hard. The game will ripe you off to like your in the coner then the guy comes through the wall and kills you.Then the tank controls are really bad and are confusing then when you are in war you are taking so much damage then you die later on. Do not get this game it is not worth the money.
2,"If you're comparing this to the PC version, stay away.","Call of Duty on the PC is one of my favorite MP games. I was extremely excited when it came out for xbox because I could finally play my friends at home. Wait...it only works for xbox live and not for 2-4 players unless you have a system link! This defeats the purpose of Call of Duty, the best feature is it's MP. First off, the single player mode is a sham, it sucks graphically and also controller wise. The controller is slow to respond and the levels are much more Counter-Strike (xbox) graphically than anything else, in other words outdated. You can't fully adjust your controller (such as halo) and did I mention the graphics suck? I am more than aware that Xbox can't really compete with a PC for graphics but activision has to live up to the expectations a PC game brings to another platform. The MP is absolutely horrible. The game play is just unnatural and sad. If you are expecting a real Call of Duty game, keep waiting."
2,unhappy with the game,"I was very unhappy with teh game. I bought it for my newphew and it took hi, a long time till he could play the game and he still had issue with teh game."
4,very fun for an xbox game,"very fun the missions are also fun, only campaign and online. i like the guns and choices. graphics are decent."
5,I like it.,"I listened to this CD, it's not bad at all. The first 5 or 6 songs are similar to upbeat ones on the Arupimac series w/ the lively beats and flutes which I like. The Crusade, the last song is slower. I actually liked more songs on this one better than the first Arupimac, in which the jovial Inca Dance is my favorite."
3,Good but not great.,"Ancient Journeys is good but not great. Don't expect it to blow you away. This set of music lacks alot of the characteristics of some of the previous CUSCO CDs. The melodies do not stand out nearly as much as songs from CUSCO's other recordings.Don't get me wrong, this is a good CD, but it's just not their best. For better CDs look to Apurimac I, CUSCO 2000, or THE BEST OF CUSCO."
5,Leather Therapy Restorer & Conditioner,"Leather Therapy Restorer & Conditioner from Unicorn Editions works. If you have soiled or hardened leather from water exposure, then this is the product you need. It has a heavy, honey-like consistency and feels oily; it should. Besides removing surface dirt, Leather Therapy penetrates the surface and lifts soaps, salt, and other contaminants and brings them to the surface. Meanwhile the special blend of oils replaces lost oils and provides lubrication (makes leather more flexible) and restores softness. Leather Therapy is great but I would not use it on leather car seats, upholstery, etc. because it may transfer to clothing. Also, rembember that this is not for suede or nubuck. So, where would I use it? Bridles and tack, leather boots and shoes, purses, etc. If you want a lighter in color/consistency product, try Leather CPR."
3,"At Peace With Honor: SOME Civil War Burials of Laurel Hill Cemetery Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","I enjoyed the book. The bios are not long but provide a reasonable amount of information about each veteran. The photographs are clear.But I have some negatives, I think the title should have been ""At Peace With Honor: Notable Civil War Burials of Laurel Hill Cemetery Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"". I was expecting to see a list of all the Civil War Veterans buried at that cemetery. I was also disappointed to see some veterans listed without noting their regiment, how did the author know they were veterans?BTW: Amazon should hire someone that knows how to spell ""Philadelphia"""
3,"Todos Mis Exitos 2 is okay, but","Here we have the yearly release of remixed and few new cutscompiled by Selena's father. While this CD is well worth the [money] for the live songs (Bidi Bidi Bom Bom and No Me Queda Mas) and a few oldies but goodies ( Munequito de Trapo, Aunque No Salga El Sol, Cien Anos) we also have a song that appeared on the last Todos Mis Exitos (El Chico del Aparamento 512) plus a terrible re-mixed version of Tu Robaste Mi Corazon (with Selena's original vocals and Pete Astudillo's new vocals). I love Selena, and this album rocks, but skip tracks 9, 11, 12 and 15 if you already have the albums Live, Todos Mis Exitos 1, and Anthology.PS The locket is cute if you are under 16 years of age."
1,I'm a Selena fan..,I am a fan of Selena's older music and I think it's too bad that none of these compilations that have been released in the last few years have any of her rancheras. Most of her fans only became fans after she died and probably think that all she sang were cumbias. Songs like Yo Te Amo and Amame are slammin'. It's also too bad that her father is using her name and fame to get rich. I wish he'd stop because she needs to rest in peace. (And were any of you people that have given 5 stars to this album her fans before she died?)
1,Not too good.,"I agree with the last reviewer, this CD is no good at all. I got it as a graduation present. Heard the whole thing a couple times and didn't like it. All the songs are played out. Some of the songs have a new twist but who cares? I liked Selena's ""Live"" and ""Entre a Mi Mundo"" CD's in which she displayed a great deal of talent but it's hard for any artist to stay on top for very long and I really think that by the time the ""Amor Prohibido"" CD was released she was pretty much out of ideas. Can't imagine this CD earning 5 stars from any honest and objective reviewer."
5,An excellent book with current information on the subject,"Thank God this book was written! Unfortunately due to confidentiality clauses victims are made to sign, others dealing with similar problems on the job do not have the benefit of their experiences. Thanks to Ms. O'shea and Ms. LaLonde for having the courage to explore this difficult subject."
3,very good except??,"I found this book very helpful yet did not see info on what is needed in my opinon that is,who's in legislation that is friendly on this subject.,who can we write,what specifics can we do to keep from getting screwed by a judge that is an oldtimer and a lawyer that is hesitant about confronting the judge that he will see in court every day"

2,Dates pretty badly,"Not a good version of mark Twain's tale at all. Rogers gags are badly dated and the ending with the modern tanks in the Middle ages war are a bit much. This is bad as it's (unacknowledged) 2001 remake ""Black Night."""
4,very soft toy,"Although a little costly for the size, this stuffed animal is very cute and extremely soft. My infant grandson loves to feel the fur. I'm also glad that the product is machine washable. I've already washed it a few times and it looks as good as new."
2,You get what you pay for,first off....if you are looking for surround sound...dont buy it...the wires to the satellites are about 30in max...if you want good sound quality...dont buy it...the speakers on my tv have better sound quality than these speakers do...this product is best for low budgets with smaller area usage...dont expect the sound to fill larger rooms...other than that...thats it for this one
3,"It 's nice, but....","It's nice , but only working with my computer, if you want to put this like a home theater don't buy it."
1,Poor sound quality,"I bought this 2 years ago. Have hooked it up a couple of times hoping for better results each time, but no luck. The sound quality is very poor."
1,Terrible....do not buy....,"This product is horrid.....one speaker does not work.....SUB hums loudly ALL THE TIME......surround does not work.....BAD, BAD, BAD!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!"
5,Good book,I bought this book because I lost the same one I borrowed from school library. It's for replacement.
3,not a kid just lazy,"everybody complains mainly of the graphics because their standards are to high, well graphics don't make a game quality makes a game. I'll admit that the graphics could do better and the framerate needs more work on but they got lighting effects right and you still get all the gadgets and extra game modes the console had. the sound does get repetetive so since they have the sound bar I just play it on mute (no big deal). I'd give it 7 out of 10 but since they only have 5 stars I'd give it a 3 so rent it see if you like it if you don't don't buy it. that is all I have to say."
4,Unfortunately Short and Easy,"Book Fans: Don't listen to ""Dude Supy,"" because he most likely hasn't read the books. This game is very fun, but doesn't last very long at all. If you like the books, you should rent it. You probably won't want to buy it, though. I rented it yesterday and beat it today. Very fun, but not for long."
1,Melissa,"""Dude Supy"" gave this game a bad review. ""Supy"" is likely 20-years old with an advanced palette for video games. It is best suited for children 6-12, like my two children who are big fans of the Lemony Snicket movie. The game follows the movie pretty closely, the graphics are pretty good, and if you're not a very skilled gamer (like my 6-year old) it's okay because if you ""die"" you just restart the task. I have a few technical complaints, but this game definitely lives up to my 5-star rating."
4,Great but Short!,Great game to rent! Fun inventions as well as mini games...only problem? I rented it monday morning and after about 4 1/2 hours of game play i had beat it. Rent...don't buy it.
1,what a stupid attempt to a stupid game,"This game is horrible. I rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it. I had wasted 5 bucks. Its patheticic. You cant do anything, graphics are horrble, cutscenes are as long as some commercials, and the characters are gay.Pros:Sunny can bite, yayCons:Horrbiel graphicsonly 3 playable charactersBad humorShort cutscenesu cant do anything1 path gamehardly 3d, (seriously, it doesnt look like it)"
2,It's Yanni-delic!,"So, yeah, everyone agrees that the cheap domestic version of The Fawn is a classic- it's as good as their first one; it's even better than Prekop's solo album- still, unless you're one of those obsessive geeks whose sense of personal fulfillment depends on the completeness of his record collection, there's no reason to shell out the extra twenty bucks for the import version...When I first checked out this page and read about the five bonus tracks, I was pretty excited, too- fortunately, I managed to find them all on Napster and listen to them before blindly sacrificing next week's weed fund. As it turns out, most of the ""bonus"" tracks are lame, gimmicky instrumentals- in fact, with one exception (""The Parlor""), they're even duller than the ""tone poem"" wank-haiku's at the end of the Two Gentlemen e.p.Buy a forty sack instead. (You can afford to buy both? Go for it! Just be careful- the trust fund won't last forever...)"
3,Sharp and sexy!,"Shoe is very nice, but it feels much higher than it looks. I will have to get the heel cut for it to be comfortable. Very high arch also."
4,"Jazz essentials, no ornamentation","This is Pat in a truly jazz setting. There are no overdubs, no thick productions (ala later Pat Metheny Group recordings), and no hooks--and no keyboards. (Lyle Mays, not a jazz improvisor, could not have survived this date.) Two of the players--Dewey Redman and Charlie Haden--were bandmates with Ornette Coleman. They know how to get ""outside"" while remaining in sync with the group. Pat's playing (circa 1981 is satisfying), but not as rich and energized as it can be today (such as on ""Pat Metheny Trio, 99-100""). Of course, a less mature Pat is better than 90% of the ""mature"" jazz guitarists out there. Jack D.'s drumming is always creative and apt."
3,Sporadically spectacular,"3 1/2A few misfires prevent the album from classic status, but often still serves as a prime example of early-career Metheny at his expansive best."
3,Typesetting errors of the Hebrew in the notes,"Spinoza's notes contain discussions of the meaning of some Hebrew words. If this will be of any importance to you, then forget this edition. Almost every word of Hebrew is butchered beyond recognition by typesetting errors. In some of these words, not a single character of the Hebrew is correct."
4,As important as ever,"Spinoza's monumental treatise on God, the Bible and the Society is one of the founderstones of modern thought, and does not need any new reviews. Many ideas expressed in the book can serve as models for standpoints also today in the intellectual debate about matters of religious freedom, critical analysis of texts and ideas, and political theory. The English translation in the Gebhardt Edition is clear and easily understood, and the book can be read without feeling the three centuries that have passed since the original was published in Latin. In the context of a new emerging wave of religious fundamentalism on one hand, and post-modernist denials of the importance of Reason on the other, the book is as important as ever to the intellectual heritage of modern Society."
4,heretical but genius quality work,"though baruch de spinoza was a heretic and a genius he was a great jewish scholar before he was excommunicated and possesses scriptual interpretations like no other. Although his arugements are very true, logical, pretty clear, and have ample scriptural evidence his passages can still be somewhat dry and boring. This work is a great attempt at trying to present an eloquent theory of religious freedom without philosophical theologogy and expose the falseness of the bible while retaining its beautiful prose and its basic almost universal truths.It is rather long 278 (pages with notes) of huge pages it is great but it can be verbose and excessive"
4,Another new twist on old favorites.,"The previous reviewer was correct. Being a Japanese import album, many of the performers on this album are from Japan and their lyrics are not as clear as the English-speaking performers. For me, though, that is part of this album's charm. I love how ""supercalifragilisticexpealidocious"" sounds like a bunch of drunk friends having a great time at karaoke. Sometimes the results are unintentionally laughable like the chorus of ""Go the Distance"" or the antics of ""Hakuna Matata."" As good and charming as the Japanese performers are, the English-speakers turn out some amazing performances with ""Chim-Chim Cheree"" and the ""Electrical Light Parade.""Sometimes amazing & sometimes hokey, but if you like an odd twist on well known songs, Dive into Disney is a lot of fun."
5,jjason blackwell urban experimentalist,"this cd is haunting, beautiful and new i felt like i was in a movie or something . i've also seen them live. Awesome. the cd is different from the live show ,but that's what i like about them there artist who are not limited.the singers are awesome the guys are legends the producer is a visionary and thomas bess is a god."
1,Reishi,"There were so many good things said about Reishi that I ordered 3 bottles. Then, when I read the label on the bottle, I found out that it is not for people who are taking a blood thinner. I have been on Plavix for years. So, I never opened a bottle. If I had known what the precautions were, I would not have ordered it."
2,Not sure about the quality,"I initially ordered a bottle since it was cheap, but then the more research I did the more I wondered why this product was so cheap. I can't verify the origin nor the kind of the Reishi which is dubious. Since then I have been buying Japanese made Red Reishi... more expensive but you get the real thing."
3,Capsules Are Fine But Has Gotten Too Expensive,The capsules are fine. Could not really tell a difference. I was willing to go along until the price doubled. I probably will not buy again.
1,Did not help knee osteoarthritis,These did nothing for me. I took them for about 3 weeks and didn't experience anything. I stopped for a week and began again and still nothing.
2,Worked Well Until It Broke in Half,"We used this Farberware ice cream scoop for six months; it came free with an ice cream machine I ordered[...]. It worked fine until last evening when my husband was scooping ice cream, and it broke clean in half. Today we bought [a different brand] scoop. I hope it lasts longer than six months."
4,Excellent buy (but not at original price!),"I purchased this for...at a Friday sale and it was well worth the price!...I would have been disappointed and would never spend that much on an ice scream scoop anyway!Again, get it on sale and it is a GREAT deal! Finish is great, looks clean cut and so modern....cuts through the ice cream well.....I really LOVE it, especially for the price I paid!"
1,"Fails to inspire, very disappointing!","I purchased this book through a book club, and i have to say I couldn't disagree more with the only other reviewer, who gave it five stars. I'd give zero if it were an option. This book sits on my shelf, with no chance of my referring to it for anything at all.The plans are poorly thought out, showing various generic examples of room additions (here's what a one story addition would look like, here's two stories, here's a bay window). Some of the elevations and roof lines of the examples presented are horrendous!Rather than give 400 plans, one third of which are worth exploring further, I'd have been better served by the author maybe developing the ones with potential a bit further."
2,FOR COMPLETISTS ONLY,"Not as bad as an obvious cash-in like the dreadful book ""The Wisdom of Jerry Garica,"" but not much better. As an audio documentary it's pretty poor. Phil Lesh's last name is pronounced ""Leash"", the author/reader claims that Keith and Donna Godchaux were replaced by Lowell George, etc., etc. A few good nuggets of information for the uninitiated, but a waste otherwise. The two stars are for the snippets of interviews with Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Paul McCartney who talks a bit about the Grateful Dead. Demerit points for a way-too-long interview from a barely coherent random Deadhead. Get this if you need everthing, otherwise don't waste your money."
5,DVI to HDMI,"Awesome little adapter allowed me to have dual screens with no hassle at all....just works, I love it!I'll certainly be ordering more"
1,This is very bad software!!,"Generally I have been pleased with Easy Media Creator but this latest version is just terrible. I would not install without doing a ""clean installation"" removing even the registry entries of other roxio products and then it still probably will not run after being installed. The support resources this company provides are pathetic. The email responses to questions are short and useless. The phone support is virtually impossible to access. If you buy this be prepared for hours of frustration and then ultimately be willing to work hard to try to get a refund because you will never be able to use it."
2,"Features, but hardly works","I've been a Roxio/ EZ CD Creator user for many years. This version and suite packs a lot of features - everything you need for multimedia it seems.Has a lot of programs that start in the background and run all the time - they use quite a bit of your memory. It also hangs, or just refuses to open components. I often have to reboot in order for it to do what I want to get done (and I have a decent PC, working in the IT business). I have not gotten a slideshow to complete - it always locks up using all the cpu and I have to kill it. The videowave version gives me so many problems I generally give up and open Videowave version 4.1 - can you believe it, so much better! I can still burn CDs great, but anything else it just raises my blood pressure. What a waste of money."
1,No good,"It would make my computer crash, and wouldn't even make a slide show. The item had to be returned. Amazon was great at giving me a full refund, but I wouldn't buy something from media creator probably ever again."
2,much promise little fulfilled,"I have to feel that the tech support, although competent, was not helpful and somewhat testy in the responses. I came away feeling that i was either bothersome or lacking in skills necessary.As a result, i am pretty sure that i would not want to deal with Roxio again."
1,Horrible,"The Dazzle can't convert analog video to digital video(so no VHS to DVD), takes forever to convert to MP4, can't copy DVD's that are copyright protected. I wasted my money and the least I can do is prevent others from making the same mistake."
3,Lacking Support,"It worked as advertised, however Roxio updates were not as they should have been.Instead of updates you get offers for new product upgrades (2010, 2011, etc.). Support for the product should be better or offer free upgrades."
1,"Disappointed, I had expected better from Roxio","I found out after purchase that this product has many bad reviews on Roxio's website forum. I had used previous versions of their software and liked it.It was supposed to be Vista certified but many people had a lot of problems. Some of the features turnd out to be not Vista compatible that Roxio finally put out a 9.1 upgrade, which just uninstalled the non-compatible parts leaving the user a bit short changed on the deal.Although I dont have the crashing problems that others do, possibly becasue I dont have Norton or McAfee which seem to mess up the install, I was not happy with its performance, which slowed down my 3mhz/2g PC cosnsiderably.I returned it in disgust to Amazon for refundNB:Amazon was selling this with no mention that there was already an EMC 10 available."
1,Roxio Easy Media Creator Deluxe Suite 9 [OLD VERSION],"Total waste of money! Had to uninstall the whole thing and I still find remnants hidden in there that cannot uninstall. It goes through the steps like it burns-records the CD-DVDs, but they will not work no matter what you do. Nor will it record-burn my digital camcorder videos. I paid 129.00 for this junk and it cost me nothing but headaches. Extremely frustrating and angry that they would rip their customers off like this. Do Not buy this product and I recommend that you not dare purchase Roxio Media Creator 10 if it is anything like version 9. I offer this advice to you if you do not want to go through the same hassle and rip-off that I went through. Get NERO and be smart; stay away from this product! That's my opinion."
1,SOOOOO Bad,"Unlike the poor folks who shelled out their hard-earned money for this waste of megabytes, mine came bundled with my new computer - a lightening fast, high voltage, very expensive desktop from a popular manufacturer based in Austin, Texas.Upon installation (if one could call it that) not only did the @$&*( thing lock up, but it also ate my RAM, thus causing every other program to slow to a crawl. Never got the stupid program to open, and, after reading all of the negative review on this site, I just gave up and uninstalled the @$#&*( thing. Which, by the way, took forever.Do note, while my software box is labeled ""Certified for Windows Vista"", upon further investigation I noted that the ""certification"" is just a sticker slapped over the ""Compatable with Windows 2000 and XP"".So, can anyone recommend some media software that works????"
2,Disable XP welcome screen,"Installation was straight forward and it worked very well. However, less than 1 week later, my computer froze and when I rebooted, I was asked for logon user name and password. After a bit of sleuthing I found out that the adapter software installs a certain Gtgina.dll which disables your welcome screen in Windows XP. It was then impossible to connect to my router even with an ethernet cable until I uninstalled the Linksys software. Not good. I'm taking it back."
4,Good acting piece...,"Orphans is a tight, well paced three-hander about two brothers and an older man. There is a clear and strong relationship between the two brothers, which would make playing each both fun and interesting. Their characters are drawn distinctly of each other enough to leave room for their similarities and dependecy and have it make sense. As a read I wanted to know where it would go, which is a good sign, and can imagine on stage the possibile dynamism of the text. I was moved by the play's conclusion and the evolution of the characters. In a way Orphans would make a good sibling/companion to True West, both featuring the trauma of brotherhood relationships coming to a head. Energetic, violent, subtle, poignant, frightened, hopeful."
1,When is a scoop a gouge?,"After three usings, the curved bail (one of the two moving parts!) that frees the ice cream from the hemispherical bowl popped out and could not be replaced. The only ""engineering"" that went into this product was to make a big, bulky, padded handle with non-slip nubbies. But what good is that if the ""business end"" of the thing isn't worth a nickle? It's now resting comfortably in the landfill where it belongs. Note that the ""pros"" down at the local ice cream store usually choose dippers without moving parts."
2,Ehhh...,I bought this game for my brother. I am pretty sure he liked it but it kept freezing and he would not be able to save the game. The game that we bought must have had problems on it before they sold it to us. Now I have to return it and possibly get a new one. I am not saying the game is bad but the one we got was messed up.
5,Great game,Love it. Item just as advertized. Even left some low levels to have unique starters. A truly recommended buy for Pokemon lovers.
4,Pokemon Pearl Version,"Pearl/Diamond makes for a really fun pokemon game on the DS. Its fun to train pokemon, trade, and try to catch em' all. Even though at its core it really is the same game as the others, it's still fun and I highly recommend it."
5,5 stars!,This game is so fun! It's not too challenging but it's not too easy either. There are tons of things to discover. Cheats are nice for this game but they are not absolutely necessary. You can get all kinds of things in this game and catch all different kinds of Pokemon and it's not hard to fill up your Pokedex.
5,excellent,El juego es demasiado completo pero tiene algunos detalles pero que a la final no le daras importancia
1,zz,Please be careful with this seller. My credit account was charged the day I put the order in. Now it has already been a month and my game have never come.
1,Game placed in misleading location,"This game is for Nintendo DS. However, in the Amazon site I searched for Pokeman Pearl for Gameboy Advanced and that is what came up. Assuming that since I search for a gameboy game I purchased the game. Come Christmas morning my children quickly informed me that Santa had gotten the wrong game. I will now try to return it for a refund."
4,Good times,"Looking for a keepsake from the 2003 Warped tour besides that Rancid t-shirt you bought? Look no further in the form of the official 2003 DVD, with performances from Glassjaw, Andrew W.K, Dropkick Murphy's, the Used, Avenged Sevenfold and Poison the Well. This well put together DVD shows what daily life on the Warped tour is like, showcases the artists involved and features a wide spectrum of music that stretches across the punk and hardcore worlds. Where else are you going to find a live version of Andrew W.K's `We Want Fun'? That alone is worth the price of admission."
2,Its Cheap for a Reason!,"Granted this DVD is average and has some good footage of Warped bands playing live and some good interviews but all the wrong songs from the bands. The Pennywise song was ""God Save the USA"" it should have been ""Bro Hymn Tribute"", The Suicide Machines song was ""Did You Ever Get a Feeling of Dread"" while it should have been "" New Girl"" or ""S.O.S."", Rancid should have been ""Radio"" or perhaps "" Olympia WA"" but instead it was ""Journey to the End of the East Bay"". Then there are songs from terrible bands on here like; Rufio, Mest, Something Corporate, Sum 41, S.T.U.N., Simple Plan, and Vaux. I guess there just on here to cash in on money since though bands are popular. Granted it was cheap for reason, but I suggest Punk Rock Summer Camp instead."
4,It's OK,"ConsIt gets boring after a wihle and you can earn neopoints, but it's like a pollypocket but neopets.ProsYou can take it anywhere on the go , and it's farieworld AWSOME"
4,Good,"Very good information but we were looking for information on ""mobile home/ trailer"" house manufactured homes. This is more on modular homes."
2,It must be hard to write a book about someone you detest...,"It must be hard to write a book about someone you detest. In fact this is just such a book. It gives little background, a few handpicked examples, and no general timeline for each of the 27000 forgeries. Yes 27000 forgeries (and while admittedly some are amateurish) the man still passed off 27000 forgeries. Certainly a little respect for his con man abilities if not for his forgery skill is due. The book is a total of 202 pages of which 50 pages are notes and appendixes."
2,Cheap and dirty with soil!,"I bought this for my girls in Dec 2012. When it came it was scratched and covered in dirt-actual dirt. Many of the plastic crystals were broken and all the replacement parts were all broken. My girls liked the look of the lamp, so I was willing to over look the lack of quality if I could get new replacemnet parts. I e-mailed the seller asking for them and never heard back. The only reason I gave it a 2, was that my girls think its a cute lamp."
4,Great Dance Album,"This is a great album. It's got an excellant mix of styles, from techno to trance and a couple styles whose name I'm not even sure of. Not only is it great for the bump and grind, but also for the sit down and listen. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that a couple songs are weak, but the mass of them are really strong and several are just incredible. Do yourself a favour and buy this record."
3,Fun when hatching and growing,"The ""sea monkeys"" hatched and grew as promised. However, in a single day while we were away at school and work, the water turned and all of the ""sea monkeys"" were dead. Obviously, my seven year old was disappointed, but it was an experience none the less. I simply wouldn't buy it a second time. Once is enough."
2,"Fun in theory, not in practice","This was an impulse, last minute holiday gift for my kids. I wasn't sure if they would like it but they loved it! It was their favorite gift. They were fascinated by the process of getting the water ready (day 1), putting the eggs in (day 2), then watching them hatch (for us happened on day 5). Easy to get started and a no stress pet!Update: they all died within a week of hatching. We followed all of the directions, so not such a perfect gift after all."
3,"Good start for introducing kids to ""pets"" and science","Just like they were when I was a kid. It was nice to walk the kids through the process. They were excited to see the Sea-Monkeys. After 2 months, they are still alive. However the plastic container started to leak on the seams. Put some packing tape on it and it's ok, but we'll see how long they hold up. It's a one shot deal, next pet will be something bigger than the monkeys."
5,Phantastic,"I have nothing new to add to the previous reviews. In general I avoid heavy metal and the like at any cost. I just don't like it. But Devin combines the obvious hardness with catchy poppy harmonys in such a way, that even I am fascinated. As if this would not be enough, there is his exceptional singing, the creative arrangements, the incredible guitars, and... and... and... In Biomech this all sums up to an incredible wall of sound which is inresistable. As Biomech is more mellow compared to Devins SYL project, nobody should be scared of his ""metal"" image. You even can look at Biomech from the traditional melodic guitardriven (hard) rock point of view first, give it a try, get hooked, realize what's going on on this CD, and explore what a genious Devin is."
5,Bets album I own,"Even a death metaller likie me can appreciate an album like this- that is, an album with absolutely godlike songwriting, searing melodies, amazing drumming, and Devin Townsend's voice (the best in modern music!). Songs like Life could be hits if given the proper promotion, but, alas, this is too good for the mainstream, as is usually the case with Devy. This album is perfect in every way. Do not hesitate to buy this."
5,igivethis10stars,"this is the best album in my entire collection, if i could review this album everyday it would only continue to receive an increasing number of stars. i recomend it to anyone who enjoys good listening. a stand out factor to me is how the whole album plays as one blending song from tack 4 onwards. if you like ""easy-listening"" metal buy this album. the use of synth is brilliant as is the varying vocal patterns. if you are looking for similar music try little known australian band alchemist (an interesting blend of mystical sitars and powerful drums), and devins other projects infinity and strapping young lad."
4,Can't beat it for the money,"The backpack is better quality than I thought it would be for the money. Four separate compartments of varying size with dedicated areas for an Ipod, wallet, keys or other similar items. It also holds a lot more stuff than I thought it would. We ended up buying a second for my wife."
2,Worked nice until it broke.,"I liked this bookbag and the suspension system was a good relief for carrying heavy books, but within a year, the top part teared and now there is a big hole. I'm disappointed since bookbags should last a while. I had a Jansport when I was in 7th grade (now a college student), and it worked forever. I bought a new bookbag last year for a change. Disappointed and a waste of money."
1,not worth it..,I read the +ve reviews here and bought this on late oct 09.4 and half months passed..I dont travel much..I just carry my dell vostro 1400 in it and few books..lately i found small tear at the edge of the bag.. and in a week it became a full hole.. and now u can see all the content of my bag through that hole..Its not as rough and tough as people told.. and its doesnt have any flap for the laptop.(which is not a problem for me.)I guess i should stick with swissgear which has solid build quality.
2,Good design but buy at your own risk,"the color is darker than what appears online. The shoulder straps didn't last a week. The upper handle broke on the 1st day. The bag seems ok, great number of pockets , can carry a lot of weight, the suspension system is really great, you can put a laptop in if you putit inside a sleeve 1st.But as I have already stated, the poor quality of the shoulder strap stitching is what makes an otherwise great product a really bad one.Maybe everybody got one that actually passed QC, but I got the bad one.I say buy at your own risk."
2,Uncomfortable Straps,"This bag does have a lot of compartments that seem very useful and it is pretty spacious for the price of the bag. However, when I put on the backpack it was so uncomfortable that I could not wear it empty for over a minute. The straps are so close to each other that they rubbed my neck in a most annoying manner. I have worn many backpacks that do not do this."
4,Yeah its a backpack,"It is a decent backpack. The suspension system helps when carrying heavy books. But I am not really carrying books to school every day... Since I am home-schooled.Lots of room. More than some of my past backpacks. But like when I went to Washington D.C. I hardly had enough room; for my notes and Campaign follow along sheets.All in all. It is a amazing backpack. Better than a lot of what I have seen. If you are looking for a backpack that will hold your books,notes or much else. This would be the one to get. It even makes it easier on your shoulders with the suspension system. So would I suggest this backpack? Absolutely."
2,Not as good as expected,"It's not as good as it looks on the screen.I am not totally satisfied with the product, but not worse"
1,That's so bad.,"That looks nice, but too weak.Already, handle and shoulder stripe were broken.I don't recommand it."
4,"Sturdy, solid, but maybe not for younger kids","I bought this bag for my nephew who is 10 and going into 5th grade this year. His mom said he needed a bag that was going to last at least the whole school year, if not through multiple years. This bag is definitely sturdy and well made. The added features like the multiple compartments and headphone port were a plus as well. The only complaint my nephew has is that while the straps are large and well-padded (to evenly distribute weight), they are a bit too wide for his shoulders, so they rub against his neck, which is uncomfortable. With a hoodie or a jacket in the fall/winter, it will be fine, and with its solid construction, I'm sure it will last him into high school where he will have broader shoulders and this won't be a problem. Just thought I'd write a warning to anyone who was considering this for smaller children - you might want to wrap the straps in some soft flannel until the kids are a bit bigger."
5,great bag,"The bag was shipped in two days and even though the color looks darker than the actual picture, the quality of the bag is great. I will be using this bag for college in the fall and it fits my 14"" laptop and case great. You could prob. fit a 16"" laptop in it too.=]There are many compartments for my notebooks, pencils, and anything else school related which is a definite plus. Its stylish and durable for college."
5,Sturdy for my nursing books!,"I have over $2,000 worth of nursing books that I lug around in this very sturdy bookbag. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase. It's very comfy, except for the straps tend to dig into my armpit a bit when I reach with it on (perhaps because I am a ""fluffy"" woman) but otherwise, a perfect bookbag! There are so many compartments in the front also! I didn't realize this until about a month after using the bag!"
3,"Attractive price, but quality...less so","As I'm typing out this review, I have my backpack in front of me. I got it in November of last year, so it's less than a year old. I'm a high school student, so I do lug around a lot of stuff around in it. It has not withstood said treatment as well as I had hoped, after reading the glowing reviews on Amazon. There are several tears in the canvas. Everything else seems to have held up okay, so far. The zippers are fine. The padding on the straps is very comfortable and comes in handy a lot. Overall, though, if you are looking for long-term quality, I would not suggest purchasing this backpack. I think its lifespan is a couple years, at most. I would suggest L.L. Bean backpacks. My sister (also high-school age) owns one of those, and after three years, it's in better shape than mine."
1,Cheaply Made,Bought the bag and within a month the zipper broke. The material is rough and it isn't user friendly. The front zipper is rarely used and it unaligned itself so now both directions keep the zipper opened. I would return it but I threw out the tags.
4,great,My son likes this bag but it tore up his larger folders and has had to downgrade to smaller ones. Not a biggie for me but he likes the bigger folders.
1,Want a pink bag?,"I have no idea of the quality of the bag, I didn't even get it out of the packaging! I ordered this RED bag for my 7 year son, when it arrived I opened the box to find a PINK bag in it! I checked the tag to make sure I had ordered the right colour, and sure enough, it said RED...I think the person who decided this was a red bag needs to have their eyes tested!!"
3,solid,solid book bag. It could use more room to carry books in it. My daughter cannot fit all of her materials for sixth grade in her bag. It was great for elementary school.
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE,Zipper track for one of the main pockets broke the first time I used it.Didnt put a crazy amount of stuff in the pocket either. 20 Bucks down the drain.DO NOT BUY.
3,Fine for the money,"Not a great backpack...kinda chintzy in its construction, but given that it was so cheap, it works pretty well"
4,Color is not exact same as it appears on website,Bag is good.But the color is a bit darker than it appears on website
5,?,Excellent backpack. large enough for everything a teenager can carry. straps on the sides keep everything inside even when teenager neglects to zip the pockets!stylish too!
4,Nice backpack for the price,"This backpack has a ton of space. Part of the material in one of the compartments has started to rip a bit, but overall it is well made and has plenty of room for everything."
3,cassie edwards,"Not going to give you spoilers. Being a writer myself I know Cassie Edwards would not appreciate what I'm about to write... In general her story plots are no worse or better than any I've read, but some of the drama in the story gets to a point where it seems silly. This book is fairly good, is easy to read, and I did enjoy it but felt it could have been written better. I've found there are less and less Native American romance novels being wrote these days, and the new ones I've read, especially hers, aren't very good. Don't know why. I have found some of her stories to be too realistic for my taste, such as this one. I would have to say overall, if your looking for a halfway decent romance this book is worth giving a shot."
5,Beautiful Christening Gift,I bought this for my 1-year-old nephew's Christening. It is almost exactly like the one I had as a child. Very nice keepsake.
5,comprehensive guide!,"As the author of a travel guide to Costa Rica (Explore Costa Rica, Fifth Edition), which covers flora and fauna (in detail), I can attest that this is a great book to take with you and makes a superb companion to Explore Costa Rica (which will be a great help with the rest of your trip)Explore Costa Rica, 5th Edition (Explore Costa Rica)"
2,"O.K. for general natural history, but there are better field guides","O.K. for general natural history of relatively few species, but there are better field guides. More highly recommended is ""A Field Guide to Neotropical Mammals""."
4,Great Product,"Pull apart and go back together cleanly and easily, dissolve pretty easily as well.Not to hard to swallow especially if you get them wet they slide down pretty well despite their size."
2,Do not work well with my capsule filler,The bag that I received was partially torn and the capsules were loose. These do not work well with my capsule filler - about half of the pills come out mangled or broken.
2,not great,All of the pill caps were smashed and looked like they had gotten wet. None of them separate and I ended up throwing them out.
3,Get Opaque Instead of Clear,"I bought these to go with the capsule machine (which is awesome!). These work just fine, but I would recommend getting opaque, colored capsules!"
4,exactly what you expect,i bought these for a craft project. product eactly what you see . true to size. large quantily for your money..prompt service from the company
1,How do I say ZERO Stars - AWFUL,"Comes from China, smells very strange, looks yellowish packaging, fully returnable but you pay shipping back and therefore it will cost you about $10 cheapest form to return a $9 item. READ carefully - if funky smelling gelatin pills from China would not be something you will put in your mouth, consider your money gone the moment they arrive. I have lost my money on this because returning them is far too expensive. From now on, ordering on line, BE SURE you read where it is coming from because there is no quality control coming from China. Isn't this a food or FDA controlled thing? Guess not - this is something I really would not put into my mouth."
1,pills arrived crushed in package,"they item arrived crushed. i know it was most likely not sent out to me that way and happened when in route to me, but either way i havent had a response back from anybody. i have only 28 out of 500 pills that are not broken."
2,gel caps,Capsules wont come out of the capsule machine and dont fit back together good when filled. I don't know if the problem is the capsule machine or capsules are a little different sizes
3,Adequate Spoeaker System,"This speaker system is quite adequate for the price. The only thing to be aware of is that if you place the bass ""woofer"" on the floor beneath your desk, the manual volume control is near the woofer and ends up on the floor beneath your desk also. This may or may not be convenient depending on how you adjust the volume. Being used to having the volume control on one of the desktop speakers, this location is not always optimum."
2,Disappointing,"Amazon web site says it's out of print, but I found it available at major book store chains. Usually a DK book is THE DEFINITIVE book on its topic. The problem with this book is that they tried to include far too much trivial detail. You probably won't find this level of detail to be interesting, unless the star in question happens to be your son or daughter, and then you wouldn't want it for anyone else in the book. As a result of this approach, the type used in the book is extremely small. Also, you would expect a DK book on this subject to have definitive photos of ALL of the well-known stars, another feature that is lacking. I would suggest the author and editor go back to the drawing board."
3,..,"it does what it's suppose to, love that. but it wants to come in on all the coners and not stay flat against the door."
5,"Great idea for storage, and teaches organization skills.","this is a great idea for storage hassles. It also teaches my daughter how to keep organized and where to find things. She loves it, and she loved labeling the compartments with the stickers that were included."
3,Barbie storage,"I purchased the item for my six year old daughter to keep the Barbies off the floor. She love the storage. I found the item to be a little ill-fitting depending on your door, but my daughter loves it. I am no longer stepping on Barbies."
4,Great organizer,"We refered to the numerous Barbies laying around the house as ""naked, matted hair"" Barbie. This organizer solves the problem-even in rooms with limited storage space. Now the dolls can be kept dressed neatly in one place and we don't waste time looking for them."
3,does not fit over door and is not adjustable.,"i think it would have been great if it fit our door, it doesn't. my husband is going to try and find a solution at home depot. i don't know if the product description stated how thick the door has to be, we have standard doors so i didn't think it would be a problem, but it is, a big one."
1,product was defective,"as i read in a previous review, the top straps were uneven so it would not hang straight on the door; honestly, the product should have been developed with adjustable straps on top. i had to return the product because for the price it was not worth it to have it not work properly."
2,Just clips?,"The content is funny, but it's incomplete. The snips are too short and you can tell there's more. I'm disappointed."
5,Must have for fans of British sketch show,"Besides Monty Python's Flying Circus, Not the Nine O'Clock proved to be one of the leading sketch shows of British television. This DVD is a great one to add to your collection, whether you are a fan of the show itself, a fan of British comedy, or a fan of Rowan Atkinson. This DVD does not disappoint. However, it has to be noted that the DVD is highly edited, compared to the original aired version of the episodes. But since there are no plans to release the full series any time soon, this is probably the only thing to have at the moment."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Rowan Atkinson for a long time, and I had heard about this show. I was very pleased when I learnt it was available, even in its abbreviated form, but the contents are really quite disappointing - vulgar, crude, toilet-style humour, muddled soundtracks, and as other reviewers have remarked, overly brief clips. What's most distressing is that this is THE BEST of Not the 9 o'clock News."
4,"Pump works, wrong size lids","Pump is easy to work and dependable, I use mine for Chocolate syrup/mocha's, hasn't gummed up, and the tip clears as pert of action. Syrup doesn't stick long to shaft, so stays clean.Though it had many lids, including 1 that should fit the big syrup can, none of the lids fit the (hershey) big jug, had to cut my own hole from the jugs own lid, installing the pump in the hole was easy, it sits securely.It could have used an extra extension straw, to bit fit for multiple containers.If you need one of the snap caps/lids this is the way to go. but if I were to do it again I would just buy the pump, it is available stand alone."

2,"Try again, Mr. Conner","Indeed, the research is very thin. It didn't teach me much more about Tuesday Weld than I could've got from reading movie fan magazines."
5,Not too scary,My 8 year old started reading this book and finished it in 2 days. Just enough suspense to keep her interested but not too scary.Overall it was a fun read. We look forward to more adventures with Mrs. Jeepers and her class.
3,"When I was a kid, this series was really disappointing.","Spoilers beware!!!She's not a vampire. Well, really it's not absolutely proven that she's not a vampire, so the one kid becomes convinced absolutely that she IS. In the first book, that's OK. Every book after that, however, follows the plot pretty much the same. Kids suspect some authority figure to be a monster of some sort, try to prove it, don't quite manage to get any proof aside from idle speculation, and the story ends unresolved.I guess it IS a kid's book, but when I read it as a kid, I found this incredibly frustrating. There were no monsters, there was no danger, there were just a bunch of idiot kids who THOUGHT they were in danger. The book is supposed to be scary, but the characters are so easily scared that it's really not scary at all.I don't think my time was wasted, exactly, I just think if you have a fiction book, write fiction. Go wild. You have a whole world you can build that doesn't have to match the real one."
5,It was a great read-aloud to introduce students to the serie,"My third graders are beginning to read more chapter books the first 9 weeks of school. I read ""Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots"" out loud to introduce them to the series. I already have 3-5 copies of the other titles waiting! This book was a very interesting book for them to listen to. They became interested in the characters right away. They bonded with the kids in the book and laughed at Eddie! They also liked how strange Mrs. Jeepers is. This is a great book for creating interest in the series and getting kids to read a chapter book. We have done summaries and story maps with the book."
4,BOYS WILL BE BOYS,I bought this awhile back for my 10 year old son. He got good use out of it and refuses to give it to charity when we give our annual donation -- he's now 13 and still occasionally puts it together when he's not on XBOX. All in all a good purchase.
4,Now we are learning the names of the bones!,"My son (now almost 6) has been a dinosaur fanantic since the age of 2. He knows the names, where they lived, what they ate...you name it, he knows it! Or so we thought, until he got this for Christmas! After having a great time making and painting the ""fossil"" he read in the manual that each bone has it's own name--so now we're learning those as well! The only problem we have with it is when the smaller pieces get dropped on a hard surface they tend to break pretty easily. They are, however, also fixed easily with a dab of super glue."
5,Learn while you Play,I got this for my dino crazy 5 yr old and we have been very pleased with it. I highly recommend this toy..Basically you cast the plaster of paris when it is set you paint it glue magnet on the back to make it kind of a puzzle. what is interesting is that the box comes with information about the bones.....and that is an added value in itself.
4,Beautiful Ragas,"I've been listening to Ravi Shankar's work for a long time. It's always nice to see when great songs are remastered, but I agree that this was not the best mastering job and therefore give it just 4 stars. The overall feeling of the CD is great and I still enjoy listening to Ravi's mastery!"
2,This game is ok,"I love Canasta and this set was ok, but not nearly as fun as Hand & Foot Canasta. Too bad..."
3,Soldier Boys,"""Soldier Boys"" is about two boys who wanted to go into the army. One of them is German and one is American. They are two boys who are on different sides of the war, fighting for the same thing- Survival.The two boys both want to go into the war. One lives on a farm in America, and one attends a Hitler youth group in Germany. The Americans name is Spence, and the Germans name is Dieter.When they get into boot camp they both start to regret going. They were surprised at how much they had to work and suffer. When they get into war they end up fighting each other. They were both sickened by all the blood and pain they had to watch others suffer through. They lost good friends to the war.I highly recommend this book to people who like action, suspense, and a little emotion. It's full of detail and excitement."
2,"Ah, just didn't cut it","I assume that most reading this are teenagers/pre-teens. For that age group, this book may be satisfactory, but I, as a teenager, found it dull and uninteresting. The story, as much as it tried, just couldn't grip me into genuinely commiserating with the characters and the situations. My advice is this: if you wish to read a book about the horrors of war, read Remarque's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". I'm beginning to doubt it's possible to believably capture the complexity of emotions and situations involved in war in a YA novel, as this author attempted to do. In this book it seemed that too many pivotal elements of the war experience were left out of the novel to render it believable, probably because of its terseness."
4,Great WWII Book!,"I have read many world war two books yet this one is very interesting because it shows both views of the war. Hitler was a horrible man yet somehow he brainwashed most of the German population. Because of this, people sometimes think that the entire German population is evil. You will relize this is not necessarily the case after reading this book. This book does not show any bigotry from the author; it tells what really happened. Great Book, I recommend it for ages 11 and up. Both boys and girls should read this book. PS: The middle of this book gets a little boring; just don't stop reading!"
4,Soldier Boys Review,"I thought Soldier Boys was an excellent book. I enjoy reading about World War II, and this book was an extremely realistic account of these two soldiers Spencer and Dieter. The book had started off slow because all the author had talked about was Spencer's school, and he also described what activities Dieter would do while in the Hitler Youth. After a couple of chapters, The American soldiers along with Spencer, had moved to Europe and then the real action in the book had begun. The author had moved Spencer all around Europe from Bastogne, France, to Berlin, Germany. The end was the best though, because it is one of those books that leaves you on the ""edge of your seat."" I would definatly reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about World War II because it is extremely realistic."
4,The Japs Are Attacking,"There is a kid named Spencer that wants to prove that he is not a wimp so he decides to go to the war and be a Paratrooper the first day was very harsh lots o people quit that day but he didn't. His friend Dieter went to the same place as him and he wanted to be a Para trooper also Dieter get sent to Hitler youth and they end up meeting and something happens read it and you will find out. What I thought about the book was it was always interesting, it also tells how it was during WWII. I think it was the best war book I ever read."
3,Average book,"I think ""Soldier Boys,"" by Dean Hughes, went from excellent, to good, to average. I think the book had a beginning, middle, but not a great ending. The story tells the tale of two young soldiers, one from Nazi Gremany, and the other a high school drop out from America. It tells a story about War World 2, and it shows the opinion of the war in two different perspectives. At the end of the story one of the soldiers make the ultimate sacrifice-in a very brave way-in a book that ends rather quickly. But, it will keep you wanting to read more and it is a very educational novel."
3,not for younger kids,"My 3rd grader (age 8) brought this book home from the school library for Accelerated Reading. He reads at a 5th or 6th grade level and the book was marked by the school as appropriate for grades 5-8. However, the book itself is categorized as appropriate for ages 12 and up on the inside cover. It is a rather graphic depiction of WW2 and the Battle of the Bulge. Good story with valuable lessons for an older grade school child. But too graphic and gloomy for kids less than 11 or 12 in my opinion. If you are leary of letting your child see a PG-13 movie or violence at age 8, then they should not read this book until they are 12 or older. I stopped him from reading after I read through it, so he did not get very far into it. He is too young to be exposed to the blood and guts, pain and suffering and anguish that war entails. Just my opinion. The library will likely re-categorize it."
1,Zach's sweetly awesome review,"""I'm sorry but I`ve made up my mind, I'm leaving. Why did I ever join the military?""In this excellent book there is two main characters. One character, Spence, is an American boy that drops out of his high school to join the paratroopers to prove to himself and all of his peers that he is brave and honorable. The other main character, Dieter, is a German boy that wants to be loyal to his country so he serves in the Hitler army. It brings out the story of young boys in war and that thought of it different then what is really is.This book is based in World War Two. The German army against the Americans. During my time of reading this book it made me want to learn more about war times and stories like this.This book is a wonderful historical fiction book. Over all I thought this book was marvelous. I recommend it to everyone of every type. Especially to everyone that likes to learn more about World War Two.-Zach"
3,Not a captivating read,"I had expected it to be a more interesting read and go straight to the treatment protocol.The book has too much background information and history of homeopathy which after reading 2 or 3 chapters, I lost the interest. Too dry for me."
5,Most intelligent and thorough overview of Homeopathy I've seen.,"When I first read this book I was impressed with the author's grasp of what homoepathy is. I suppose it isn't surprising that a NASA computer scientist would produce an excellent and insightful overview of an area of study that was brand new to her. Her treatment is thorough and intelligent. The powerful testimony of the amazing cure which she brings to her understanding of homeopathic medicine lends authority to what she says; she isn't simply listing beliefs. I am personally very satisfied that Ms. Lansky (unlike other writers up to now) has stated that homeopathy is not ""complementary"" to orthodox medicine. There is nothing like the truth! The two medicines are based on entirely opposing views of health and illness. Everyone interested in health should own this excellent work. There is a very useful reference seciton at the back."
5,This book might change your life.,"I strongly recommend this book for any one looking for well researched information about Homeopathy. This Book helps to understand this powerful medicine system and will for sure led you to give it a exclusive try... and that, might change your life for ever, as it is changing ours... I'm glad it was available thru Kindle, so I could have it and read it right away.I wish I could give it more stars... Thanks Amy !"
5,Discover the Magic of Homeopathy,"Amy Lansky, is a brilliant communicator-teacher. Her book about homeopathy is intertwined with the story of recovery of her son from autism. If you care about your loved-ones, if you care about yourself, your health, the quality of life, you must read this book. It will change your life forever."
5,Unique Insights,"I'm a midwife who has used homeopathy both personally and professionally for over eight years. There are many books that cover the ""how to"" of homeopathy, but this is the first book I've read that covers the ""how and why"". I was particularly struck by the depth of insight that Amy brings to her work - her science and engineering backgrounds combine with her personal experience to provide a uniquely convincing perspective. What an excellent contribution to modern healthcare!"
5,Perfect for Beginners,I loved how easy this book was to read. It covers everything from early history to resources in finding a homeopath and what to expect at the first visit. I have wanted to know more about homeopathy for a long time and this really pointed me in the right direction. Great resource.
1,the puzzler,"I loved Sit & Solve Cryptograms, but I was very disappointed with S&SC#2. The authors were more interested in finding quotes that didn't contain words like ""the"" than they were in finding interesting and meaningful quotes. Most were just a bunch of jibberish. Also, the font used is very small and close together, making it very difficult to read what you've solved."
5,An eclectic collection of traditional and contemporary tunes,"I purchased this after much review on Amazon, and it was exactly what I was looking for. It is a wonderfully varied collection of Irish jigs and reels with some other less traditional but still lovely tunes mixed in. The Amazon previews you can listen to adequately provide samples of the music.Kim Robertson does a lovely harp piece called Molly on the Shore which has White Coral Bells hummed in the beginning - may sound unusual or even weird, but it really works and it ends up going through my head all day it is so lovely. There are some pieces by John Whelan included as well that get my toes tapping each time I listen to them. What I like best is that none of the songs sound repetitive with one another since there are various artists and music styles presented.My daughter Irish dances to some, but there is enough variety mixed it that I enjoy just listening to it while making dinner when she takes a break from dancing."
3,"PERFECT CONTENT, DISAPPOINTING RECORDING (or rather SERVICE)","Let me get things straight from the beginning: the content of this CD is fabulous. Then, you might ask, why 3-stars only? Well, the primary reason for me buying this CD was that it has been recorded in HDCD format...To my great disappointment, after this was delivered to me here in Germany (which means extra tax paid on top of its price) I found out that it is not HDCD encoded. Pity and shame...Going back to the CD itself, fantastic dance music, really thrilling content. Wish I could say the same about the service..."
2,Buyer Beware,"Despite being well written this book did not deliver on the title. For a broad overview of how the industry works it is ok, but I failed to find one insight into professional writing secrets or much on the craft or approach to writing."
2,Like the Curates egg,"I haven't read it all in sequence just the chapters that appealed and like the curate's egg it's good in parts. It's filled with insider information and I get the feeling they are only telling us the bits they want to tell us, it's all a bit partial. There is very little uesable information in it.It was a fascinating if unhelpful read. You learn what certain people think about the business and how they started but a lot of it is irrelevant as it is too personal. There is very little you can take away and apply to yourself. It's an interesting but, strangely, uninformative read."
4,"Entertaining, Enjoyable Flick","This is a fun movie with a bit of a serious side. We really enjoyed watching a very young David Niven and an even younger Loretta Young. It even has a bit of stage magic thrown in, which was almost as fun as the rest of the movie."
5,Thomas & Friends - the Greatest Stories,Great entertainment for 2 year olds. My grandson loves Thomas and it keeps him entertained for awhile.He loves the stories and you can pause the DVD in between the stories when they get too distracted.
5,Great Thomas & Friends DVD,"I bought this for my 4 year old and he watches it every day.A great learning tool as the series teaches children how to get along with others,and to treat others the way you would wish to be treated."
2,Some Mean episodes,"My son loves thomas the train and I bought this because it had so many episodes on it. However, it includes several episodes where the trains are mean to one another. That is not the type of behavior I want my son learning from thomas the train! He is 2 years old and tells me to turn off those episodes. So for me, I have to pick and choose which episodes on this to play for him. I would not recommend this dvd."
3,Good Compilation. Hate the Commercials!,"Good compilation of the Thomas short stories! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is, ALL the COMMERCIALS for other video's prior, that I am not interested in!!... But MOSTLY, that the DVD will not allow you to forego them, and go straight to the Thomas stories! That pisses me off. When I BUY something, I should not be forced to watch commercials prior to what I purchased! They should at least place the commercials at the END of the Video, and give you the option to watch them, or not!!! I would not mind that. I would even be compelled to watch them, once the video was OVER! It's no fun to have an impatient 3 year old yelling for Thomas, while your trying to get past 20 commercials!"
3,Its ok,My son is obsessed with Thomas so I got this for Christmas. Ends up this is the clay mation type Thomas and not the more modern stories. He is ok with watching it but not as interested. I wish that Amazon could have listed what type of Thomas movie it was b/c I probably would have not bought it.
3,Old Thomas Videos,"A good collection, however it is the old, original films which seem to not hold my grandson's attention as well as the newer episodes."
4,Great for the Thomas Fan,I purchased Thomas and Friends Greatest stories for my nephew and my son. They are both big Thomas fans and really enjoy watching the dvd. This dvd is great for children who are just being introduced to Thomas as well. It contains several of the most popular episodes. I would recommend the dvd for any young train fan.
5,great video,perfect for our small conductor. it arrived when scheduled and was brand new. so it was exactly as described. I would buy this again and recommend to my friends.
1,Broke after one viewing,"My boys love Thomas and I thought that they would love this...well they did...but the dvd gets stuck during the previews and will not move forward anymore. you are not allowed to skip through the previews, so you have to watch them and when you get to the preview for Barney, the dvd stops working....scratch that...BOTH dvd's stop working at that point....what a waste!"
4,Great for the children,Thomas always captures the imagination on young ones and has very valuable lessons that all our children can learn from. I recommend any Thomas the train stories! His friends bring a big smile also.
2,Thomas the Train,It was my mistake that made me unhappy with this CD. It is one of the older ones and is narrated and the not the animation in the newer one. I will reorder another one but a newer version.
2,You Think These Are The GREATEST STORIES EVER?!!,"Well, I Rewatched The Episodes On This Dvd & After That, My Reaction Was That These Stories Are The NOT-SO Greatest Of All. I Mean What The Hell Are They Thinking?! Why Did They Reuse The Stories From Other dvds? Why Isn't The Engine Roll Call Used From Thomas Saves The Day(season 8) To Duncan Does It All? Why Is Molly On The Back Of The Case & Diesel 10 On The Image Of Disc 1 Those 2 Never Appeared On Those Stories. One Question To Every Thomas Fan On Amzon, What Are You 20 Of The Greatest Stories Instead Of The FALSE Advertising One? It Is One Of The WORST Thomas Dvds EVER!!!"
5,This CD ROCKS!,"My brother is the lead singer, so maybe I'm a little biased when I say that this is one of the greatest cds EVER! Still, the music is energetic and fun and although it was released by a Christian label, it isn't heavy handed or overly religious and is versatile enough to be a crossover rock cd. My only qualm with it is that there aren't enough songs. 12 is such a sad little number to stop at. :("
2,"Good, but I've heard ...","Yes, they are pretty good, but I've either heard better or I've heard more of the same. They are kind of like the ""hard"" Petra at times, but mostly they are like a lot of other ""cookie cutter"" rock groups.As for this particular album: first off, too many of the tracks that sound alike are placed one after the other. Example: Tracks 1 and 2 were so similar that I thought someone forgot to change the canned background. I liked #5 a lot (both music & lyrics) and liked #6 OK, but it was so similar to #5 it was ... well, boring.Also, I agree: that last track was a bit of a ""downer"" to end on ... they should have ended with ""Just Let Go"". Simple fix? Get the CD, rip it, burn it back out in your own order. That works. Amen."
3,Good gift,This was a gift for my Nephew and his family. They loved it and it benefited the devistated families after Hurricane Katrina.
2,I know what it means to miss New Orleans.,"We have for many years spent the week after Christmas and before the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. Our love affair with the city includes the people, the history, the food and most of all the music. I had hoped this CD would bring echoes of the spirit of New Orleans, it did but not in the sense I expected. It is a New Orleans funeral march with the slow reverence to loss but without the final up beat celebration of a life well lived New Orleans style."
4,the City that Care Forgot is sweetly remembered,"True New Orleans-area music is captured here on this benefit disc. If you've ever experienced this gem of the world, the CD puts you right back there. It doesn't stop throughout: you are cermoniously dropped right into the flavor and feel of New Orleans at the first note of Allen Toussaint's Mardi Gras-flavored version of ""Yes We Can Can"" and you stay there until Randy Newman and the accompanying orchestras hit the last note in ""Louisiana 1927"".Do you feel any melancholy? Yeah, you right! Do you wish you could do more for those who have suffered? Yeah, baby.This is a wonderful compilation of artists from the area, and even more than a year after Katrina - it's worth buying and supporting the Habitat and musicias who lost their homes.I DO know what it means to miss New Orleans..."
3,New Orleans isn't about dirges,"I give it three stars because anything by Allen Toussaint, Randy Newman, Buckwheat Zydeco, Irma Thomas and the Wild Magnolias (and many others) should get at least that many. But, man, is this a depressing CD. One funereal piece after another until the Magnolias kick it. And Newman's ""Louisiana 1927"" has always been gorgeous, sly and elegiac -- suitably ironic to include it here. Doubtless everyone was shocked and depressed when they cut this, but geez -- the New Orleans music I love, even the funeral songs, is infused with joy and an infectious second line beat that you just can't help moving to, even when you're down. I had to go back to the splendid 4-CD ""Big Ol' Box of New Orleans"" to recover."
1,Disappointed,I was diappointed with the CD I ordered as many of the songs skipped. This was suppose to be a new CD. I was lead to believe it was original as not a pirate. I would not order from this company again. BEWARE.
2,Goin' home to New Orleans,This was not of very good quality and the performers (?) did not do justice to the honoree.
1,New Orleans Rises Again,A great collection of tunes that highlight the resurgence of New Orleans as an irreplaceable American city. This CD provides music for every taste. This is really a timeless collection.
1,I am disappoint!,The second half of this album was unreadable. I tried both my computer and a CD player; neither could get past track 8.
5,A taste of home,"As a former New Orleanean, this CD brings tears to my eyes, a smile to my lips, and joy to my heart."
4,Best of the Unique to New Orleans,"The more I listen to this CD the better I like it - it grows on me a bit more with each playing. I love the variety of styles of music represented here and each style has its own New Orleans flavor - Dixieland Jazz, Jazz, Zydeco, blues, rock, et. al. It is amazing to me that this group of extremely talented musical artists put this CD together so soon after the tragedy of the levies breaking in the wake of Hurricane Katrina - this, too, speaks to their incredible talent and hearts. It is a ""SOUL HEALER"" for anyone in any circumstance."
1,Completely Despicable,"Completely agree with the other reviewer. The only reason I own this is because the artwork made it look like some ridiculous horror movie and it was $1. I had no idea what I was in for. Read the other review and you will understand how awful this thing is. I hesitate to call it a movie because I could make a better, more entertaining film by walking around my neighborhood, strike that, let's go smaller, MY BLOCK with a camera. More would happen! I ended up fast forwarding through until the last two minutes.Worst dialog ever. Worst lack-of-plot ever. Horrible acting. Awful camera work. Worst sound ever; move the boom closer! I can count on one hand how many things happened in this piece of trash. Stay away from the ominous red light and this VHS."
2,Not So Simple,"Epstein is a brilliant guy with a great idea - simple rules are better for society than complex rules. At least, that's what I think he says. This book is NOT for the masses. Here's a sample from page 30: ""Although I have from time to time been of different minds on this proposition, I have now made peace with myself and believe that these consequentialist theories--that is, those which look to human happiness--offer the best justificatory apparatus for demarcating the scope of state power from the area of individual choice."" Huh? Mr. Epstein, would you consider a comic book version for the rest of us?"
4,"Fun, but no durability","My son received this toy as a Christmas gift. While he loved to ride on it, it began to fall apart almost immediately. First one of the sides split in two. After glueing it, the shaft that controls the steering broke. We replaced that but the whole thing finally broke in two."
2,"The ""official"" view","I never cease to be amazed at the People's willingness to accept information at face value. This book avoids and does not even discuss other views of the Watergate break-in -- some of them quite credible or at least worthy of discussion. Read ""Secret Agenda"" by Jim Houghan and ""Silent Coup."" Whether you agree with these sources or not (""Secret Agenda,"" in particular, is thoroughly researched and totally credible) it is Fred Emery's job as author of a supposedly up-to-date treatise on Watergate to either concur with or refute these established sources. The bottom line is this: there is much more to the Watergate story than is presented in this book. John Dean has never come clean on a number of important details, and the reson for the break in is still shrouded in mystery -- a mystery that this book does absolutely nothing to dispel."
3,I did not get the item after one month,"I ordered the item one month ago, and so far I did not get it. Amazon told me that I can get it maybe in next 20 days. That means that waiting time is at least 50 days. When you buy it, you had better count waitting time in."
1,Be aware of the delay on delivery,"Same experience as the last reviewer...I ordered on June 20th and haven't received the item yet. I kept receiving the emails from Amazon which asked for approval the updated shipping date.On the product URL site, Amazon still claims that this item is in stock and can be shipped in 24 hours. It is all BS. I called the customer service number many times and got told their fullfillment center has difficulty to ship the item out.This is a good product...however 1 star review for Amazon."
3,Good For An Old Machine,"The Dell OptiPlex GX1 is a pretty good system. I think that Intel Pentium 3 processor is just as good as the new Pentium 4. I bought this about two years ago but in 2004 I bought the Dell Dimension XPS Generation 4 desktop computer. I love it but I still have this Dell set up in my office. One of the things I really hate that it only has 10 GB of hard drive space. I use so much more than that. Dell's customer support is not so good either. They might say that they have 24/7 support but they never call you back. 500MHz is REALLY slow! 128 MB RAM isn't so bad but you could do better. My XPS has a Intel Pentium Extreme Edition 4 3.4 GHz w/Hyper Threading Technology, 500 GB, 1 MB RAM and all the things that make it a great system. I might not really like this computer but it's a good second choice."
4,Holds everything I need,"Safely holds my holds my phone, ID and keys. Installation was relatively easy. Additionally, it's easy to remove when I leave the bike locked up at a bike rack. The only concern is with putting on a tail light for night time riding. The pack has a place to clip the light one but I find that it angles my light downward and lowers visibility. Thus the 4 star rating."
3,Nice but large and clunky!,"This is fine, but wastes too much space with the connection, get a Timbuk2 or other flush fitting bag to save this space!"
1,unsafe,"I'd avoid this product for now. I've gone through two of these in the last year. I love the idea and the ease with which you can slide it on and off, but therin lies the problem. The saddle attachment mechanism is made of very thin, weak plastic. I've had two bags break in exactly the same manner: the thin plastic on the locking mechanism attached to the bag breaks, the bag falls off the fixer attached to the saddle rail, and dangles precariously by the velco strap that wraps around the seat post, bouncing off your rear wheel. NOT what you want to have happen on a screaming descent in the Italian Alps, as happened to me.This bag may be fine for those who ride couple hundred miles a year on smooth pavement (good luck finding it). But for serious bikers who have to contend with the rough and tumble of pot-holed roads, as we have in New England, try something else.I do love the bag, but will not be buying a third one unless Topeak does some R&D; and strengthens the attachment."
1,Didn't feet on my bike seat,"Never used the product because it didn't fit on my bike seat. It wasn't obvious to me that it wouldn't fit, so make sure before purchasing."
3,Not Terrified Any Longer,"I got this book as the only book for my introductory statistics class and was relieved. Although there are errors in grammar and in some of the homework solutions, I found the book easy to read, easy to understand and very user friendly.I would recommend this book for any beginners at statistics, just be wary of the answers."
2,Horrible!,"This textbook is horrible! It makes relatively easy statistical concepts unbearably confusing and over-complicated. I used this textbook for a graduate-level class, yet found myself constantly referring to my statistics notes from undergraduate classes--which I think is pretty sad. The only reason this text got more than one star is due to the many tables and charts listed in the back. They were the one semi-decent portion of the book. Caveat Emptor--Buyer Beware!"
1,Meandering Martial Arts Mess,What a great disappointment! This is one of the those movies where the trailer is the best part of this movie. The story line is poor. The action scenes are poor. If this movie were FREE I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Great Concept - Fight Scenes Suck,The best part of this movie is when the True Martial Artist is coming down out of the mountains and he does His Forms! can't say much for the rest of this movie. That one scene alone was worth my $2.99 $3.99 rental.
1,Boring!!!!,"totally uninspired metal resembling Judas Priest. if you're buying this because singer Ralf Scheepers was in Gamma Ray, don't bother"
3,ok for the money...but not great,"This screen has a rather cheap look you will notice as soon as you take it from the box. I am using it in my 10 year old son's room, and for that it is fine. However, we have many flat screens in the house and this one has the worst picture quality. I find everything to be very bright and lacking any real depth of color. A few pixels were bad. My son on the other hand, being 10 years old, has no complaints."
1,GARBAGE,"I HAVE OWNED THIS MONITOR FOR A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR, AND IT STARTED PLAYING TRICKS ON ME, THEN IT FADED. IT IS PRETTY IF THAT IS WHAT YOU NEED, BUT IT DOES NOT LAST. MINE IS IN THE GARBAGE CAN NOW."
4,A little book full of prayerful practices and ideas!,"I originally bought this book hoping to find new styles, patterns, and detailed instructions to make the traditional Catholic style rosary.....however, what I ended up with was a wonderful tool explaining the meaning of rosaries and the spiritual significance and prayerful practice of making 'non-traditional' rosaries (Malas, Rosary Bracelets, Rosary Shawls, etc.).Recommended for anyone who loves working with beads and incorporating beadwork into their spiritual practices. Few photographs (black & white only) and some crudely drawn (but user friendly) diagrams scarttered throughout the book. A good book for beginners, but advanced and professional Rosary Artisans may find this reading dreadfully dull.Overall, I enjoyed the book. I paid full price, but would definately recommend buying it 2nd hand or when it is on sale!"
2,OK if you need a self help crutch or have never heard of prayer beads,"I was disappointed by this book and that takes a lot for me. It contains lots of stories on bead strings the authors have made for every cause you could think of. I found very little use for the tiny sections on color, numbers, amulets, and shapes. They contained little information of value--much less than a five minute romp on Google.Much, if not all the information seemed to be geared to troubled women and children. Great if you are one, and if you are this is the book for you.For the rest of the readers who have lives that pretty much function and are looking to make a tool to add to your spirituality and complement your meditative practices, look else where."
2,Out of date statistics,"Sure would have been nice if this book had been updated to current statistics. The concept of the book is very good, but the statistics are too old to be relevant. The book was published in 1995. For example, they were still referring to the USSR, East Germany, and West Germany in the statistics! Come on, time for a revision. If this book would have been up to date, it would have been a gold mine."
3,Seemed to be used,I have wanted this statue for years and I finally bought it new off Amazon. It was simply shipped in the actual box nothing protecting it so now it looks like I have had it for 20 years. The statue was miraculously not broken but the bottom looks like it has been repaired. Since it was on the bottom and I had waited so long to have this I did not return it even though I believe I have received a used item at full New price.
1,"If there's no image, you most likely are not getting what's advertised.","When amazon places a book and a video together you would think they belong together. Don't buy anything that states ""no image available"". I didn't receive what was advertised both times I ordered the product. The book Fish! does not go with the DVD Fish!, they are selling a video about fish, not about customer service pike fish market."
1,"Shipped wrong ""Fish"" to Australia","I also was under the impression this DVD went with the ""Fish!"" motivational book. $20 to have a stupid documentary about fish sent all the way to Australia. I eagerly waited 6 weeks for my exciting ""Fish"" DVD, to share with my workmates - I just hope they have forgotten and don't ask me where it is - HOW EMBARRASSING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Adequate,"I expected this to be a good, strong, reliable opener and it is. It is heavy and sturdy built, easy puncture, strong grip on the can and never slips. Unfortunately it is hard to turn (arthritic hands could never work it) and it leaves the lid attached by a thin piece of metal. The lid must be twisted once or twice to break it away from the can. Wouldn't purchase another one."
1,Poor Poor Quality,"Farberware makes the worst quality can openers than any others I have encountered. I bought two farberware can openers in the past two months and each one broke after about a one month of use. Even though they look sturdy and the grip is great, the mechanism itself quickly breaks. If you can, stay away from them. I promise you its a waste of money."
4,A Really Pretty Bratz Doll!!!,"This doll is really pretty and has excellent clothes and acessories. She is fun to play with, and she goes well with the Eitan Formal Funk doll.I love it!!"
5,Very cool!!! You would love this stuff!!!,My mom gave this to me last Christmas! OH MY GOSH!!! It was sooo cool! I have 4 dollz of Yasmin and i love them because i look like her (promise!) But there is a problem... WHY CANT I OPEN IT!!! My mom said that I am not allowed to open it... so how could i know how fun it is? Well... by staring at it I already know! This is great!P.S. My Scene are such copycats... no offense
4,Perfect,These sound great and are easy to install. I would recommend them to anyone that is looking for a good speaker at a great price.
4,Very good and easy to mount,The sounds are very good. The installation instruction is clear and accurate for easy mounting them on the ceiling. The price is also worth the quality.
5,WOW - What great sound !,"My wife and i recently had our porch redone. We had the ceiling wired for these speakers and the sound quality, highs and lows, is perfect. Highly recommend these to anyone looking for either great outdoor (that do not get wet) or indoor speakers."
3,Good speakers,Got these speakers because of the reviews and they seem to live up to what other customers say about them. They sound pretty good and the price was good. I didn't install them in the ceiling so i had to do some modifications to get them in the cabinets that i used. They come with plactic mounting hardware so i had to remove that so i could use them. Other than that i would recommend them.
4,Great Speakers,We have put these up in the hall of our College Radio Station for passers by to listen and may become listener to our station. They sound sensational.
5,"Yamaha 8"" Ceiling Speakers","Very good sound quality.Very easy to use and secure mounting system.Wire attachement works better and securer with plugs rather than just pushing wire into connectors. Without the use of plugs, the connections nuts are hard to grip and tighten and still do not hold speaker wire very securly."
5,Must Have For Great Sound,"I knew from my teens that Yamaha produced great stuff. And, it was confirmed with the installation and sound from these 2 Yamaha speakers. Very well made with some heft to them. The instructions were straight forward and direct. Of course the sound is the thing. The high and low was quite clear and really a pleasure to listen to. The price was right and the value the best ANY-WHERE!"
1,What a waste,This book seems more like a work of fiction or a docudrama than a biography.The author talks about her subjects emotions in a factual manner- emotions that theauthor couldn't possibly pretend to know or actually confirm.This is the worst kind of biography and the family is probably sick about their cooperation.They couldn't possibly have realized what a hatchet job this book would be.
1,worthless,so poorly made and hard to use it is worthless. i just attempted to use it for the first and last time. the spout depends on a small hook to open the valve to allow fuel to dribble into the tank.however it is difficult to keep the hook engaged on the filler rim. eventually the spout broke off and is now down inside the filler pipe. my wife found an old wire coat hanger and i am trying to fish it out.PS i gave it one star because amazon will not allow zero stars.
1,The spout causes spillage,This is the first new fuel can I've bought in a long time and I was shocked at the new nozzle design. It took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to work it. In the process I spilled a ton of fuel both on myself and on the ground. Whoever designed this nozzle must not have actually tried to use it. I don't suppose it's specific to this manufacturer but I think the nozzle is having the opposite effect of what was intended.
1,Horrible spout design.,"The spout on these is spring loaded and SLOW. You don't just tip these into the tank, you have to line up a hook on the spout with the side of your fill neck. They will not pour unless the hook is pressed up against the fill neck. And once you finally get it all lined up and flowing, you're gonna be there for the next 20 minutes tilting and aligning the neck and tilting again because these things flow EXTREMELY SLOWLY. I would not buy these again."
3,"good, but it leaks without the spout","This is a good fuel can, but for storing fuel you need to put the spout inside (upside down). Otherwise it leaks through a pinhole in the cap. That means the spout soaks in the fuel and when it comes out its covered with fuel. This can be fixed by making a rubber gasket for the cap."
2,"Good storage , bad pouring","To fill and store is great , no smell and doesn't leak.The problem is pouring . Tilted to pour it will start to drizzle, tilt some more and a small second stream will start from the can . The one i have has a funky handle with a pull lever and a store/pour button which must be pressed first before pulling lever .(Note this is the FIRST use and cap and hose snug tight) .To be honest, it did save me from and uncomfortable situation. But a gas can that leaks sorta defeats the purpose .I think if it had an ""old school"" simple cap there would be no or less problems . That "" improved "" button full cap is a joke ."
1,"Blitz closing for ever, forget that warranty","Be aware, Dan Rather is reporting that Blitz is closing their doors permanently at the end of July 2012. You can probably forget about any warranty or support after the end of July."
1,dont waste your money,"I bought this mic 3 months ago, it worked pretty good while it was working. But it just stopped one day, i tested it at guitar center and it wont work on their computer either. I bought a mic from radio shack for $60 that didnt sound as good but it lasted way longer than this one. my mxl mic didnt last a year."
3,Great unless you need a monitor,"The sound and clarity of this mic is brilliant. However, if you are a serious voice over actor, and you need to use headphones, this will not work for you. The nature of it being a USB mic causes a delay in the headset that so far I have not found an inexpensive fix for. I've now moved on to a condenser with preamp to solve the problem. If you don't need a head set or monitor, record away! The mic is great in that case and takes no steps other than plugging it in."
4,Best USB Mic thus Far!,An excellent mic for the price. Used it for a project and recorded excellent. Only drawback is configuring the sound like you want it. USB sometimes gives you changed levels. A must have for beginner recording or a small budget.
1,Not what I Expected,"I thought it was a cream when I ordered it, but when I received it, it was drops. All in all, it was good."
4,Roots Rock Remixed,"I have been a big fan of Bob Marley for quite awhile now and I am always skeptical of any ""remixes"" of his works. Marley's songs are so perfect and beautiful that I usually feel that they should never be touched.So while I've been burned in the past on previous reworkings of Marley's music, this ""Roots, Rock, Remixed"" is actually really good! The songs are basically left intact and are not cut up/sliced & diced to the point where they're unrecognizable. All of the songs have basically been updated with better beats.If you're a fan of dub, downtempo, chillout you should enjoy this. The remixers did a great job of not making the beats sound too modern/ futuristic to the point where they don't go well with the original songs. Overall a really great remix album that does justice to Bob's songs. It's good for hanging out/ chilling out/ relaxing/ de-stressing."
5,Yes! Yes! Yes!,"Not a die hard, but a long time fan of bob. I like chant down babylon, and I love this. I'm dancing outta my effing boots over here. I've known of this album for a long time but waited so long to buy it. Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,Great game; online play is poor compared to Warhawk,"I played a demo of this game several times and then immediately bought a copy when the price dropped. The concept is a lot of fun, but the online play lags big-time and there aren't nearly as many people playing as Warhawk. For the money, Warhawk is a much better (and faster-paced) game for mass online battles."
4,"good game, but no point to i t","I got the game since i play a online demo, and really enjoyed it. But now after having it for some time, there real was no point to getting it... the online is the same as the game play... it's just missions and there is really no point so far to this game. no story line, nothing to really achieve, just go in and shoot. don't get me wrong its fun and all but wow talk about lack of options... But onto the shipping and company i got this from, for the game, am glad i got it for this price, and the shipping was good to. Regular shipping only took 4 day to get to me. So I was happy with that, I would do business again with this company. But the game, that I question. I just think as time goes on this game will just be another one of those thing that is just there to pick up dust"
3,Not what I exspected!,"I thought it was suppose to be a mission game, not a territory games of get the flag, they make you you switch sides after every battle."
3,Great game (most of the time),"It's a great game but there are unbearable load times for every single time you enter a new map you can have a lot of fun offline but it's meant to be played online with other humans, problem is when you join a match there are usually only 4 or 5 other people and the rest are A.I. controlled players. When the game works the way it was meant to It's a 5 star game but that's not the case most of the time ESPECIALLY on PS3."
1,Hate at first sight.,"I bought this for like 8 bucks used at GameStop and I brought it home and played it. As soon as I started playing it I realized it sucks. It is no fun, do not buy this or rent this. I returned it and got Lair. Which is better."
2,below average game,"Oh boy where do i start. this game was terrible, i expected it to be alot better and which saying so i should have expected nothing out of this game and maybe i would have enjoyed this game more. the shooting was terrible and was definetly not your average combat game. the graphics were the worst part. just the entire gameplay in general was awful. this is game is a ok buy for the ps3 but dont expect very much from it."
1,Worst Game EVER!!,"I have played a lot of fps games in the past. Never have I encountered sucha weak and pathetic game like this before. I think this is the worst gameI have EVER played.The graphics are terrible!! This is what I would expect from a PS1 not forPS3. If the graphics aren't bad enough, the sounds are the most terrible andannoying ones I have ever heard in a game. The humans in the game have a high and nasty voice. I don't know what happened to Quake. I played Quake 4 and loved it. But this was just terrible. A lot of rooms were empty and looks like if the game developers put no effort into this game. I can't really go into gameplay because I only played it for like 10 minutes. It was that bad.So save yourself the 60 dollars and just rent it. You'll see I'm right (hopefully)So i just traded this game for GTA4 and I cant even put that game down!!"
3,Space Age Crystals,"Instructions are hard to follow, crystals break easily, and they do not grow 4 inches as expected, mine grew only 1 inch."
2,Did not like ?,Only one of the three crystals grew as described. What more do we need to say? no no no no
3,The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection,"These were the MGM moveis starring Ms. Rutherford, and although the prior reviews listed them as the quintissential protrayal of Miss Marple, I found them very lacking as an accurate protrayal of the Christie character, as well as in the abuses inflicted by the screen writers on the Christie stories. I was startled to see Ms. Hickson (my very, very, VERY favorite Miss Marple, probably for forever!!) in one of these movies as the housekeeper. It was delightful to see her as a young actress. She looked very much like a young version of the Miss Marple that I know and love. Ms. Rutherford is very far from the physical description of Miss Marple in Christie's books, and her acting style is really not representative of the Miss Marple personality and excentricities as described in her books, either. So, I found the movies, although delightful to watch on their own merits, a disappointment as an Agatha Christie lover."
5,"Miss Marple, Margaret Rutherford","I enjoy having Margaret Rutherford play Miss Marple. I just wished she had made more films as this character. Her fellow, Mr. Stringer,was her real-life husband. Theymade quite an enjoyable pair of detectives."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for Margaret Rutherford Fans","Margaret Rutherford's ""Miss Marple"" films are my favorite - especially ""Murder Ahoy"" (Lionel Jeffries is a joy to watch in this one). My sister and I have watched these movies over and over and have never become tired of them. Our only regret is that there are only four in the series. The casting, directing, wardrobe, musical score and locations are perfect. You can buy the CD set or you can buy VHS individually. If you love her - don't miss this."
4,The only genuine Miss Marple,"Margaret Rutherford is the best.All others pale in comparison. I remember these from when I watched them on television a thousand years ago. Eagerly I watch new versions as they appear, only to be disappointed. Margaret Rutherford and the entire crew have set the standard for Miss Marple. No one else has come close."
4,Not to be missed,What a treat. Margaret Rutherford puts all the joy and suspense and it all amounts to sheer pleasure. The wonderful expressions on her face and the frustrated chief inspector are just a hoot. I particularly like that she gets several marriage proposals. Hang in there Mr Stringer! There are so many Miss Marples but for my money Margaret Rutherford is the perfect sly as a fox addled Jane. I have watched these many times and each time discover something fresh.
5,Great gift for someone who has everything,"this was given as a gift, to someone who has a huge collectionof movies and tv shows...he loves the older movies and shows, so this was a definite hit with him..especially since it was on a list of things he would like to have!"
5,Silly but good!,"I like these movies. Margaret Rutherford can be a little hard to understand, but I like her. I would recommend this DVD boxed set of Miss Marple to others."
4,Sweet old lady,"These 4 films are a bit dated but still entertaining and amusing greatly due to the presence of the unbeatable Margaret Rutherford. It's also fun to see her acted with her real life husband, Stringer Davis, in each one of them. GQ"
4,Miss Marple - A set of classic 'Whodunits',"What a delight! Margaret Rutherford in full flight is a sight to see. I haven't seen a Miss Marple movie for many years, but I remembered them with a great deal of pleasure. When I saw this set finally released, I could not help myself; I had to buy them....I have not been disappointed! I'm not entirely sure what it is about Margaret Rutherford, but I would describe her as one of the all-time greatest of character actors. When she rolls up her sleaves and gets stuck-in-to the task at hand... she's very determined indeed. If you are into the older style of movie making and enjoy a real 'whodunit' with a splash of comedy, I highly commend these movies to you."
4,Product Description CORRECTION,These DVDs are presented in Black and White NOT color as the product description states. I was disappointed when receiving the product as I thought the versions being sold on Amazon had been colorized.
5,Wow!,"I couldn't put this book down. I agree with one reviewer, this is not a book for the faint of heart. If you like books that are wrapped up in a bow and made pretty, then this is not the book for you."
4,Only one word - wow,"This book is about as twisted and nailbiting as real life. This is the first book I've ever read from Anne Stuart. Her way of writing is a little confusing, but her story line definitely over looks it.I rate 4 stars because even though it was a little hard to understand at times, the plot was there and it definitely kept me reading. Her romantic scenes were enough to make my temperature rise. The book kept me in suspense, for the most part.. even though I had a gut feeling of who was better and who was worse.It would make a killer movie (no pun intended).If you like romance and suspense, I would recommend."
1,Ick,"I have liked Ms. Stuart's previous ""dark"" books, even those other readers didn't, but this latest is just dreadful and leaves the reader feeling slimy besides. The PUBLISHERS WEEKLY review is right on the money: The hero is a rapist as well as a coward, the heroine is so badly damaged that she thinks rape and verbal abuse are love and the nonsensical plot is obvious immediately. Every author has an off book once in a while, and I'm certain Ms. Stuart's next one will be up to her usual standard."
1,"Shape up, Stuart!","Anne Stuart is one of the few writers whose books I buy automatically...and I haven't been sorry until this one. This one is pretty much a mess, with unbelievable, unengaging characters (a sure sign for me: could never remember what they were supposed to look like) and a couple of holes in the plot that you could drive the hero's vintage Cadillac--plus a few of Elvis's--through."
2,No thanks.,"A year after learning of her beloved cousin's death in an apparent drug deal gone amiss, Jamie is sent to find answers by her aunt on a quest that will lead her face to face with the man who found Nate's body, Dillon Gaynor. The two have a highly charged history dating back twelve years to when she was an innocent, but he has always been a bad boy.The tension between them is charged with a sexual energy that is palpable, and though they fight and snipe at each other to avoid it, they can not ignore what is between them. Yet even as they hover around each other, a vengeful ""ghost"" watches, bent on revenge.** In a blend of Stephen King and Anne Rice, this novel attempts to widen Ms. Stuart's audience in a steamy tale with no redeeming characters or qualities. Instead of romantic, it comes off as smutty, overriding what could be a genuinely suspenseful story to become nothing more than a nearly pornographic semi-horror story. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
1,E for effort equals 1 star at best !!,"I used to be a fan of Anne Stuart that is to say until she started putting crap out like this trainwreck! Yuck, gag me with Kelly Rippa's silver spoon! I have not enjoyed Ms. Stuart's last few novels, I'm sorry to say. She is getting like a lot of the oldies but goodies...can someone besides me say the word retirement? Just a thought!"
1,Awful,This book was absolutly horrible. What a waste of my time. I could not relate in any way to the characters. The book was a disappointment.
3,INTO THE FIRE - OUCH!,"I read this at the pool and got sunburned!!!! :D Altho I thought Jaime was a dork for going after Nate's killer in the first place, the story got my attention. I love tension between the hero and the heroine!!! And Dillon was worth the attention.But underneath, I felt sorry for Jaime wanting love from an adopted mother who was cold and heartless. The story kept my interest for an afternoon and I did so enjoy Ms Stuart's Black Ice. This hot weather here in Florida seems to encourage me to read these types of books. Well, it's back to the pool!"
3,Hott but wanted more...,"I chose this as one of my erotic reading choices and as I was super busy this week it took me a little longer to read it than usual. I loved the male character, Dillon. He is the most explored character and fascinating character in the book.The heroine, Jamie left a lot to be desired. The character is twenty-eight and yet she seems to have the comprehension and thought processes of a twelve-year old. Granted she was stunted by an incident that occurred when she was sixteen, however while this does explain her sexual naivete it does not explain the remaining immaturity of the character.The story itself is interesting, but unfortunately, it never ventures beyond the surface of events. It literally never goes past the basic blurb of the novel. The erotic scenes are not what I would say hot, and are barely sensual. The sexual tension is forced, where it should have been natural. The entire eroticism of the plot, in my opinion, stalled the story and didn't coherently fit."
4,good read,it was a page turner. i liked the hero and the heroine. the hero could have been a little open about his feelings.
5,"I *heart* bad boys, especially one this bad!","Well it's clear the Dillon has issues. It is also clear that he is not as bad as he seems. I really just got into Anne Stuart and I really like that she slowly reveals a character a little at a time. But clearly, in the very beginning, Dillon is HOT and bad and really protective/crazy and tenderly in love with Jaime.I wouldn't say that he *forces* Jaime to have sex with him, he's just very very direct and he knows all of Jaime's buttons. The sex is HOT because it is so tortured.What can I say? I read this in a day and I still read parts of it just to experience the sizzle between the protagonists."
5,Truly mesmerising,"I am so impressed with this compilation of beautiful songs from some of Irelands finest artists. The tone of their music flows straight from their hearts through to yours. Truly joyous in spirit, it lifts you gently into the warmth and comfort of somewhere beautiful with a singing heart. I cannot recommend this CD more strongly. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
2,"I would give 3 starts, but I didn't like it.",My 2 year old pit tore it to pieces in less than 5 minutes. NOT for strong chewers. Otherwise have fun cleaning up the mess.
5,A Touching Tribute,"The Last Call is a wonderful book. It is a quick read that will have you laughing on one page and crying on the next. What a wonderful tribute to a mother and brother. I get tears in my eyes just thinking that the mother and brother never got to read this wonderful story. I recommend this book to everyone I know who lost someone close. Beautifully written, Darryl should be proud of this work."
5,What's not to love?,"This product is absolutely 'the berries,' from its design to its function, from its light weight to its adaptability / adjustability to hold something as small as an index card or a few sheets of paper up to a book of 3-400 pages. Contact Corporate Express Brands in Colorado 800-424-1011 to get yours today!"
2,Wrong Product,"I ordered this item thinking my customer would like it. He really wanted something heavier - like steel & not plastic! Rather than returning it, I will use it in my kitchen as a cookbook stand. So, it's not really a product review."
5,Durable Book Stand,"I am a law student and typically prop my 1500+ page books on top of this stand. I am surprised at how great it works. For under 10 bucks, if you're looking for quality, go no further."
4,A good sequel to Carlson's book on Horn,"After reading ""Killing Is My Specialty"" I had to get Carlson's sequel on my recent trip through Wyoming. I found it in a bookstore in West Yellowstone, MT, leaving plenty of Wyoming time to read it.Between the Horn book and the Lefors book, a mock trial had been held in Cheyenne wherein Horn was acquitted.Although both books appear to be very well documented, I couldn't help but feel that Carlson may have a bit of bias in favor of Horn and against Lefors. Not being part of the Wyoming culture, it may be unfair to make that characterization, but it's what I felt.An eminently readable book; not to be read without having read about Tom Horn first; preferably Carlson's account."
4,Truly Horrifying,"I read this book directly after reading ""Last Exit to Brooklyn,"" which I enjoyed greatly. ""Room"" is, as I said, truly horrifying--its descriptions of torture, rape, and murder are far more horrendous that any other Selby book."
1,Do not purchase Kindle version,"I couldn't get past the first 50 pages on the Kindle version. I can't speak for the paper version, but the Kindle version had no punctuation, no quotation marks to know who is speaking, no paragraphs, tons and tons of typos....it's distracting and frankly you spend more time trying to figure out who is saying what than what they're saying."
2,Writing is good therapy...,"but not always a good book. The room, has an interesting premise, maybe for a short story. But for a novel it gets tiring quick. It doesn't seem to have much of a point other than to offer up two different fantasies of an inmate: one very violent and disturbing, then other benevolent. Whatever, they both get old. Some of the writing is the most disturbing I've ever read, which is fine, if it has a point. I don't believe it does. I have read two other Selby books, Last Exit and Requiem.. both are far superior to Room, Requiem is a masterpiece! So if you haven't read any selby go to one of those two first."
3,A bit long-winded,"The book definitely got it's point across, although several points in the middle seemed to be ridiculously drawn out for no apparent reason other than to serve as filler."
1,What a disappointment,"This is the most disgusting, boring, and terriable book that I have ever read. I loved Requiem for a Dream, though that wasn't exactly about flowers and little pink bunny rabbits it carried a strong and interesting story as well as characters that you were able to identify with and care about. The Room is just awful. It has no plot, no character development (or characters at that), and is just an endless flow of rancid images. Fan or not of Selby's work, The Room is just simply horriable."
4,Bleak yet convincing,"This book is very depressing. It paints a picture nobody wants to view. Some of the prose in this book is poorly written, and there are some minor factual errors. It also makes a convincing case that an extinction level event is taking place around us. I don't feel that all of the reviews of this book are being fair.The supporting artwork for the book is stunning. Alexis Rockman uses delicate lines and bright colors to bring the prose to life. Oddly, the majority of the artwork is not illustrations of future species. Instead the pictures diagram and explore life history and human influence.Many parts of the book had me second-guessing the author's conclusions, or looking up things on the web. That's the sign of a great popular science book. This is not written for biologists, but it's significantly more scientifically grounded than most books on future evolution."
5,a daring and ingeniously visionary view...,"A daring and ingeniously visionary view of a difficult subject. Humans have irrevocably changed life on earth and Ward approaches the subject matter with wit and humor without trivializing it. Rockman's work is, shall we say, superb."
5,"Good, also read SB 1 or God by Maddox","From an evolutionary history Mr Ward imagines, with scientific support, our future. The Imagination is good, keeping this review simple, the book has about one in a billion chance at being prophetic. Too much can change and adapt in ways we havnt even begun to understand to predict future evolution, but Mr Ward is surprisingly good and we need such persons to keep on advancing us all. A Book that states our descendants will have to force evolution in their favor(to be able to survive and adapt to self inflicted environmental change) by existing technology actually intriged me much more is SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox."
4,"Good book, weird author.","Often at the beginning of the chapters, he includes information or stories which are inappropriate and unnecessary and that don't appear to further add to or explain the subject matter at hand. However, the same personality trait that encourages these types of overly imaginative passages also creates attention-catching descriptions about past geologic events or future predictions that require creativity to conceive. The author's explanations and descriptions are clever, vivid, original and captivating. They not only keep the reader curious enough to continue to the next page, but also leave one compelled to learn more about paleontology."
2,Blah....,"I give this book two stars, because the premiss is interesting. Unfortuantly, I did not feel that this was a good book. It gave me the same feeling that Carl Sagan's books did of a man with a certain nihilistic view of life. He seems utterly convinced that humanity is going to wander down the path of what basically amounts to biological damnation. He does not take into acount that there are people all over tbe world that are struggling to save the natural world, though they are sometimes few in number. I was throughly disapointed by this book. I am a realist at the core of my being, but this book seems to have a rather cynical bent to it, though I agree with the author that we as a species will most likely not go the way of the do do and the passanger pigieon. Anyway, there are my two cents."
1,The dude below was right,"Unfortuanately, I do not share his love/hate relationship. I simply hate it. Vehemently hate it. A few good ideas and a whole lotta depressing ones. Interesting scenarios for future evolution, though. Otherwhise a Whole lot of nothin'."

1,Save your money,"I just got one of these for Christmas. Today is January 7, 2010 and my Stylus is back in the box waiting to be returned after attempting to use it ONCE. The button to change bits won't work most of the time, and when I can manage to get it to open and put in a bit, the darn thing won't stay turned on for more than a minute. I charged it for 24 hours and it didn't help. At high speeds it won't work at all. I'm going for something different and with a cord . . ."
1,help please!!,i just purchased the dremel stylus and CANNOT get the collet to open to put in the accessories. nor can i remove it. it says to move the switch into the locked position and then turn it counter-clockwise. i cannot get the collet to turn AT ALL in either direction when it's in the locked position. can anyone please help? am i doing something wrong? did anyone else have the same problem?
5,He LOVES it!,I purchased this stylus for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it. He makes and paints resin figures and he said this stylus was the best tool on his work bench. He loves the way it feels in his hand and can do everything he needs it to do. When not in use it fits in a holder and takes up very little room on his work station. If you want to make a special person in your life buy this Stylus for him.
1,"Won't Stay On, Stops in seconds","I had the same issues as others reviewing here. At first, in high speeds, it would run for 30 seconds then automatically stop itself. Then even low speeds would do that. Had to pull out he hand carving tools to finish my pumpkin carving. So sad. I got the impression they built in some sort of out of balance safety circuit that was malfunctioning. Try a Zip tool instead."
2,short battery life,"Got it today because it was the best they had at the hardware store, taking it back in the morning. After 3 hours of waiting it only had enough charge to work on and off for 10 to 15 minutes. You also can't change the battery, so if it runs out on a job you can't have a spare ready. Was comfortable to use, though doesn't have a quality feel for what that's worth. When charged seemed to have all the power I need. If your willing to pay the money this might be a good choice for occasional hobby work. For more serious work get something else."
4,Formal Funk Dana,"With the new Bratzpack Dana doll, you can have lots of fun! She has two pretty changable outfits,*Long, pretty hair*A comb*Over 15 accesories*Shoes & a posterThe bad thing about this item is that Bratz look better and are funner in regular clothes than prom clothes. If you like this item also try looking at the Bratz Dana Girlz Nite Out! doll, and the Bratz Girlz Nite Out! Cloe."
5,Great Doll,"I just purchased this doll for my niece, but now that I have it i'm thinking about keeping it. The doll is packaged so perfectly! The clothes are great, and the doll's hair is done so pretty! This is a great piece for a collection, or for that special little girl in your life."
2,Condense it to one paragraph,"While I appreciate the contribution the Stones have made re our inner personalities, this book could have been one paragraph: ""When you want to write your resistance will think of millions of other things you should be doing. Don't do any of them.""That said, one idea that was worth the cost of the book for me was: if you never want to write a book, set out to write the most special book in history.You might want to buy this book just so you can try to figure out why the heck the Stones put all those poor quality, meaningless photos in there! Am I missing something?Two stars instead of one because of excellent work in the past.Eric WinterMelbourne, Australia"
5,a great book for all models,"i recommend this book, because it gave me all the information i needed to get started in a modeling career."
5,Delicious European Cookie,"These cookies are really delicious! You can't find them anywhere in the United States. The outside of the cookie is crispy and light. The inside filling is like a dry raspberry jam. IT IS SOOOOOO good! It is easy to eat the ENTIRE box in one sitting. La Paille D'Or just came out with a blueberry filling, but you can only get those in Europe or in Tahiti! Enjoy."
5,works as expected,connected nicely with my pump and works as expected. A nice addition to ensure I do not overheat my pump. having 2 power cords is clumsy but understood.
4,This goes to show never give up if you el it's not fair.,"This video Gideon's Trumpet was a true case that really happened. Clarence Earl Gideon was charged for breaking in to the town store and was giving an unfair trial. He was sentenced to jail and at his trial, he was not giving an attorney to represent him. This video was slow at the beginning, but as it went on it got better and better. Gideon, Then wrote a letter to the supreme court to see if he could be given a fair trial. Somehow, he was given a fair trail and was proven innocent. This video, in my case, was very good. This goes to show that never give up if you feel you were treated unfair."
4,Clarence Earl Gideon,"Wouldn't you want a lawyer to represent you in court? Well, a man named Clarence Earl Gideon made that possible for everyone. Clarence Earl Gideon was a poor old man who couldn't afford a lawyer to represent him in court. He was able to read and write, but didn't understand the court system's and did not know the write questions to ask the people. He wrote a letter to the Supreme Court asking them to review his case. They agreed with him and passed a law saying that if you can't afford a lawyer, read and write that a lawyer will be apointed to you. So, thanks to Mr. Gideon persuit to get a lawyer, it is possible for everyone to have a lawyer represent you for verious reasons. I feel tht if yu go to court nd a lawyer is apointed to you that not only should you thank the court, but Clarence Earl Gideon as while."
3,I thought it was all right.,Gideon Trumpet by Robert Collins was an alright movie. This movie shows how persistance pays off. It also shows how you have to work to get what you want in life. The thing I like most was about Clearence Earl Gideon was his ability to work hard and stand up for what he believe. He never gave up hope and kept studying up on the constitution. The reason why I gave it three stars was because it wasn't to date in our time and some of the thing looked fake. But I did like how they went into the court when Gideon and his lawyer won the case by proving that guy was the look out and said Gideon because he saw him get into a cab. The guys friends were the real burglers.
3,This movie shows the american public how are rights are used,"Gideon's Trumpet was an out standing movie about the lives and rights of ordinary poeple. It showed the way the laws in this country have changed to meet averyone's needs. The movie was also rather long, but it was still a learning experience. The actor's in the movie gave rather good rolls.Especally Henry Fonda, his performance was out of this world. I would have to recomend this move to every one who likes educational movies."
3,The drama in the coourt.,"Gideon's Trumpet was an interesting movie.The movie first started out with Gideon an innocent man who thought that going to the pool hall to use the phone would have been a better idea then using it at the motel and disturbing other people. After Gideon got to the pool hall he was accused of breaking in and stealing change out of the vending machines.While he was in trial he order that he wanted an lawyer, but the judge said if he was on trial for an capital offense he could not have a court appointed lawyer.Gideon was given a 5 year sentence and while he was in prison he started to read and study about court cases and it's process. While he was reading he realized his rights and appealed to the Supreme Court and they ruled that he needed another trial and he got it. In the other trial they found out that the guy who supposively had seen him at the pool hall was the one who had done it and Gideon was set free."
4,It was Excellent!,"I thought Gideon's trumpet was a great movie. It was very informative and easy to follow. It showed how one man's letter changed everyones right to have a lawyer. It also showed that if Gideon hadn't had another trial and a lawyer, then an innocent man would still be in jail. This was a very interesting movie and I think everyone should watch it and learn how we all got the right to have a lawyer."
4,One man's courage against the system,"Gideon's Trumpet starring Henry Fonda did a wonderful job interpreting the Gideon vs Wainright trial. This was an exeptional movie about a man seeking someone to represent him in a court of law.He was arrested for theft and the court was unable to provide him with a lawyer. This is a very educational movie that helps to explain this trial. Henry Fonda does a very good job acting as Clarence Gideon. Fonda is a spitting image of Gideon.Overall, this is a good movie. I gave it four stars. This movie really helps to explain this trial. I would recommend using this movie to teach about the trial."
3,Great Law Study Video,"My high school law teacher showed this film to show how the right to have a lawyer, even if you could not afford one, was made law. It does not make you feel he is innocent, like must law films do. You see the facts and decide as you go along. It's a very good film."
4,This movie was pretty good,"Gideon's trumpet made me think how the system works.Gideon got the Supreme Court to retry his case because he didn't have a lawyer.Then the black guy who didn't have a lawyer,and he didn't get retried,he was let free.I don't think that was far.That means the others would have been retried or let free.How can they honestly pick who gets retried or let free.Overall I think it was a good movie, because it really made me intreested in this class."
2,Gideon faught for his rights as an American.,"The rights of Americans should never be denied to anyone. In the movie,""Gideon's Trumpet"" dirrected by Robert Collins, these rights were not given to many people. But a man by the name of Clarence Earl Gideon turned his life and everyone elses around. Gideon an innocent man who was prosecuted for the crime of breaking and entering, and stealing money and alcohol,got him a five year sentence to be carried out at a Florida prison. But he knew that it was very unfair to him, because he was never appointed a lawyer. Gideon then appealed his sentence. The Supreme Court then came to realize that their system needed another change.Soon after the Supreme Courts decision, Gideon recieved a fair trial with a lawyer. In conclusion, the system is not perfect and the rights of one man are no different from the rights of another. Clarence Gideon is a hero to the American society and will be in the books forever."
2,Disappointed,"As a review or account of an important historical event it was O.K., but I was disappointed in the performance of an Academy Award-winning actor in the person of Henry Fonda. Overall the movie was lackluster and had no screenplay or music score to thoroughly engage the viewer as you would look for in a motion picture. It is more of something you would see on public television....Certainly, not a blockbuster."
1,Blow your trumpet somewhere else.,"Blow your trumpet somewhere else.Gideon's Trumpet was not at all what I was hoping for.It was missing parts I thought would have made it better.In short it was just to dry.When I watch a movie that is based on a true story I expect two things:not all the truth and the truths should be twisted a bit.Not the case in Gideon's Trumpet.It was played out exactly how it happened.I mean they could have made it much more interesting.Such as showing that they found the real theif after Gideon was free.In conclusion, I obviously disliked this movie.Its just not suited to my tastes.If you like movies that stay right on track by all means get this one.But,if you like them with a little more glitz and glamour look on."
5,Landmark Film on Land Mark Case,"Fonda's performance is perfect, and the film covers all the issues without missing a beat. I use it every year in my government class."
4,Amazing story!,"I highly recommend this video to all government teachers when discussing Constitutional Law and the Supreme Court. Clarence Earl Gideon's story is not only amazing and true, but it was a Landmark Case. Movies is a bit dated, but my seniors have always enjoyed it."
5,Gideoon's Trumpet,"Henry Fonda did a good job protraying Clarence Gideon's life . The message to exercise our rights by speaking out for what we think is justice should forever be practice, as this story proves that we are eventually heard. This story is slow and determined as reality would have been to get this law changed which made the movie better for me. No big egos or action here, just the simplisity of hope and belief in what one man knew to be his right. Inspiring."
3,not too bad for required viewing,"Gideon's Trumpet with Henry Fonda is a decent movie. It was required viewing for my high school government class, and it was definetly better than our required reading of The Federlist's Paper's! The acting is decent, but it more importantly shows how the U.S. legal system was changed forever by one man's faith in the Constitution. It truly shows that one lowly man can make a difference and change the lives of many."
3,but he didn't do this one,"An old felon is taken as the one who robbed the pool hallfor petty cash and beer and wine by breaking and entering.He is sent to prison for five years after asking the court to appoint a lawyerand being refused. In current terms he would have been confined for life as it was hisfifth felon conviction since he was 14 and broke into a store to get warm clothesin winter.This story is a strange one and it appears some young felons had named him patsyfor this crime. After two years in prison he was lucky enough to be chosen as a constitutionallaw test case.Even more lucky than that, his lawyer won.In the retrial his conviction was reversed,because it seems that he sometimes ran the pool halland had a set of keys.This movie was one of Henry Fonda's last roles and it showed his liberallife's work to a good light."
3,Gideon's Trumpet,"I thought that Gideon's Trumpet was a really great movie. It showed the Court Case and at the same time made it interesting. It's sometimes hard to learn about court cases because a lot of times it's not that interesting but this movie took the boredom out of the court case. I think that this movie gave hope to a lot of people who don't think they can make a difference. Mr. Gideon was from a smalll town, but he made a difference to all of those people who go to court and might not be able to afford a lawyer. I think this movie was great. I really recommend it to teachers who are teaching this case to their class."
3,This video shows one man's fight against the government.,"This video shows how one man fights for his rights in the constitution. The constitution gives the people many rights. Gideon was denied the right to an attorney after he asked the judge for one. He was tried at a trial without the proper representation. After he was sentenced to five years in prison, he then began his fight against the system. He looked up his rights and found out he was denied one of the many he was entitled to. He then had his case reviewed. The supreme court decided to hear his case. He was then appointed an attorney to represent him properly. This proved the point that Gideon could not present himself properly and was sentenced. When he was represented by an attorney he was found not guilty. This video shows how the constitution can work for the people in any situation."
2,The Clarence Earl GIdeon Trial,"Gideon V. Wainwright is a 1963 court case in the state of Florida. Gideon was charged for breaking and entering a poolroom and intent to commit a misdemenor. Gideon did not have any money to hire a lawyer, but in Florida a court appointed lawyer was only called in for capital punishment cases. Gideon was tried and convicted and sent to prison for five years. When Gideon went there he looked up his constitutionl rights. He found that the constitution shows that he has the right to have a court appointed lawyer. He then filed a habeas corpus petition to the Supreme Court. They reviewed his petition and agreed to hear his case. The Supreme Court ruled that Gideon had the right to have a court appointed lawyer and to be retried. He then was retried and had a fair trial. Gideon V. Wainwright is a good movie. This movie shows how the leal system was challenged and changed forever. No matter who you are where you come from everyone has rights."
1,Horrible,"The ink cartridges were leaking when they arrived. Neither would work with the printer that I have, despite me putting in the printer name and model beforehand and being told that they would work with my printer. Sending them back to get my money back."
2,Didn't work very well for me,"This device only sort of worked for me. Sometimes it would work fine, but on occasion it would freeze up the stereo head unit, which would require pulling the stereo out, disconnecting power, removing this dongle, powering it up, then turning it off again and reconnect the dongle. Then it would work again... for awhile...It also disables the built-in CD player, and when somebody not knowing any better would stick a CD in, not only would it not play, but there was no way to eject the CD without going through the above procedure.It's possible my problems were limited to the particular Sony head unit I had, but I'm not sure. I replaced the head with a Clarion unit that has external input as well as a USB port. This adapter went in the trash..."
2,Need to unplug occationally,"Occationallly need to unplug and reinsert the adapter to make it work, which is a major annoyance. Otherwise the sound is OK. I have a Sony CDX-MP40."
4,"A classic science fiction ""what if..."" story","It all begins with a simple invention -- ""slow glass"", an improved version of regular glass that's better and stronger. Plus, its refractive index is so high that light travels much more slowly through it, allowing thinner lenses.But, every improvement comes with unintended consequences. Windshields made of slow glass are incredibly stong; but images seen through them are slightly delayed, causing judgement errors and crashes. Efforts to improve or capitalize on effect this cause further surprises. In the end, this ""simple"" invention completely revolutionizes society!The story is told from the inventor's perspective, who sees technological advancements as fundamentally ""good"", even when they turn out to have huge consequences -- things that create a dystopian future that no one would consider good. The story is a thought provoking one; how can we balance the benefits of a new technology against its potential for harm?"
2,Lacks variety in content,"Disappointed with this text because of the single project through which this publication teaches After Effects. Compared to previous AE: Classroom in a Book books (earlier versions of After Effects) in which multiple creative projects unfolded as the learner used the tools, After Effects 5.0 teaches the program through one long project. The authors clearly guide the learner through important aspects of After Effects. However, if you are seeking a learn-and-do book that exposes you to a range of creative uses for After Effects, this book may be a disappointment."
4,a good teaser,"I just finished this book's tutorials. I really learned a lot but got confused a few times and I had to keep a very good track of the many steps involved. I didn't know sometimes what I was working on and toward the end of the project I felt like I was putting pieces together blindfolded. This is maybe due to the huge size of the overall project. I had to make sure I didn't miss any step and I spent maybe too much time cheking my work's progress. Except for that I learn a great deal, my knowledge of AE was very basic and I got a peek at a great deal of useful features. This is not a referance book and as they say ""refer to the Adobe online help for more informations"". It gave me a good grasp of what AE can do, and helped me a right away simplifying production and solving problems with my work."
2,AE Freakshow,"The authors of After Effects Classroom in a book edition 5.5. unfortunately have lost themselves in showing some nice stuff AE5 is capable of. Doing so they have forgotten about the principal goal of the book, teaching peopple how to use AE5. In comparisson to CIB 3.1 the new book is very meager in really explaning what is done every step. They simply tell you the steps, yes, but they don't help in understanding them all. Freaking in a Book would be a good alternative title."
4,Shank differences,"This Dewalt Model has a spline shank chuck. To use the accessories that are shown ie; sds plus bits, calls for an adapter that changes from spline to sds plus. This adapter does not come with hammer drill and must be purchased separately. Anyone buying the sds plus bits as shown will be quite upset when they can't use them right away. There are a number of adapters available: spline to max, & spline to a 1/4-20 threaded end to accept a hammer drill chuck for round type shanks. With these as part of the total kit, you have a very good hammer drill. You have a very good hammer drill if you choose to use only spline shank bits, also."
3,So-So Spoon,"There's a minimal amount which can be said about a spoon. With that noted:My only gripe is that the angle or curve of the spoon isn't quite right. It doesn't allow you to get into the corners of your dish correctly, and seems to make things come flying out of the dish on the rebound. It is a decent looking tool, and is fairly well made. The grip handle is an added bonus. It doesn't have the quality of some of the higher end brands, but it's not a bad tool for the price."
2,"Not really a 'best of"" album","Since the songs for this album are taken from only three albums, it is very misleading to call it a ""best of"" album. There are three songs on the CD unavailable anywhere else, two are live versions, and three songs from the European version of Joko but they are not enough to make this CD worth having. Buy a different album."
3,Amazing voice,"Angela McCluskey has a raw voice as if she's just finished a good cry. I could listen to her forever. The unrestrained accompaniments are so over the top as to be unintentionally funny. But the singer's artistry is so great, one forgives the instrumental excesses."
4,A great saddle bag. The Fixer doesn't fit my saddle.,"I have used and have been a huge fan of this saddle pack for years. I have one on every bike and when I get a new bike, I get this bag.I travel withtwo C02 cartrigesone inner tubetwo tire leversone adjustable flow co2 inflatorone mini combo allen wrenchAnd everything fits.Why only four stars. Well, the older model of this pack used a quick release plastic clip that never fit my saddles. So, I had to zip tie the release to my seat. That works, but it would have been nice to be able to use the included attachment.Well, this is the new model. And it would be nice if the company would appreciate that the attachment DOES NOT WORK for the Selle SMP saddle or many other types. If attached to the rear of the saddle, the saddle rails are wider than the attachment. So, once again, back to the zip ties. They work and the saddle with the bend and aero appearance is great.So, love the saddle, hate the fact that I need to use zip ties."
3,Would be a good pack if it were compatible with my bike,"This is a nice pack, but it doesn't hook onto my seat properly. I had to buy the one with velcro to fit correctly."
4,Bratz are not the slutz around here,"Bratz are the most kewlest things ever! They are beautiful in every way! (...) People say that bratz are icky and sluty and their child will not be reciciving one this christmas from fat old santa but barbies instead. People say bratz have attidudes and they are to under weight, but the balimic dolls here are they little skanky barbies kids play with these days. (...)My little 9 year old cousin plays with bratz, not barbies and has no bad ideas from their clothes or faces. She hates barbies! Buy bratz, they rock...take it from a kid that plays with them and dumpd barbies. They are the pits!-A bratz fan :)"
3,Definitively this should NOT be your first book on C++ .NET,"A bit dissapointing.This book is more about what not to do than about what to do or how to do it right. With the recently released new 2003 version of Visual Studio's the C++ compiler for the NET, it might, even, be a bit outdated.If what you're looking for is a kind of tutorial book on managed extensions( such as myself) this isn't the right book.Later, I got ""Microsoft Visual C++ NET professional projects"" and this is it. more than 1000 pages of practical advice, consistent and easy advice C++ and the .NET.Maybe, after i get to know C++ more deeply ""Programming with Managed Extensions for Microsoft Visual C++ .NET"" would become an interesting reading."
5,Great info on wrecks in the Northern Keys,"Great book. Includes a little bit of history of each ship. When it was built. Who owned it. How it came to be a shipwreck. Tom certainly did his research. Covers the most popular dive sites in the Key Largo area. Even covers some of the not so well known, including the Northern Light. Don't miss it."
3,"Entertaining, but.........","There are some good moments in this DVD. It's intresting watching the ""four horsemen"" of the sasquatch hunt (Rene Dahinden, John Green, Grover Krantz, Peter Byrne) in interviews and puzzling how none of them get along anymore. Mostly I was disapointed by the extra features on the DVD and the way the producers were subtly poking fun at the subject. All the DVD extras consisted of were opinions on the patterson footage by hollywood make-up artists, not educated scientists or anthropologists. Also, I had read somewhere this DVD contained the complete patterson film, enhanced and uncut. This is not the case. You will only find snippets of the footage throughout the feature as in many other bigfoot documentaries."
5,More engaging than anything you'll find on cable.,"If you have a few ""fringe science"" documentary books/videos/DVD's on your shelf, you'll want to add this to the library. 40% Bigfoot/Yeti/Giant Ape, 60% insight and history into the PEOPLE who've been driving the research for 50 odd years. A bit on the pricey side; but you'll be happy to add it to the collection."
1,Poor Quality Video & Audio - Not Produced Well At All!!!,"A 2-disk set of a hotel conference held on Bigfoot that features 4 well known researchers, but fails to produce the disks with good quality video and audio. Excellent material being presented, but absolutely the worst video co-ordination & audio production possible. A total waste of good money!!"
4,Bigfoot lore with a comical twist.,"It's always good to see the comedy side of mostly serious topics, bigfoot being a fringe subject with not alot of lighthearted humor surrounding it. We believers take this subject seriously in an enjoyable way that lets us believe that there is still mystery in the world and we are not complete masters of the universe just yet. This dvd is very entertaining if not to informative and gives insight into the four men who started serious investigation into the bigfoot phenomenom. Bigfoot songs, excerpts from d-movies{pretty campy stuff}, and a host of interviews from real reseachers are not well edited together but it adds to the fun of dvd. Overall I think it's a worthy addition to the bigfoot catalog but take it with a grain salt and sit back and enjoy."
1,Worst Bigfoot Documentary Ever!,"This is the worst Bigfoot documentary ever produced. If you have even a remote interest in Bigfoot don't think about purchasing this DVD. Productions like this will keep the public thinking that Bigfoot only exists in the minds of outcasts and screwed up people. The title of this production should be titled four men who need a life. And the price! What a waste of money. The people who write these great reviews I suspect have a financial interest in the DVD, I don't know how else you can explain it. I have loaned this DVD to many people and they have shared my sentiments."
4,Interesting DVD,"This DVD was enjoyable, because I was interested in personally viewing some of these long term bigfoot researchers, that I've only recently heard and read about. So for me it was entertaining, to hear what they each had to say in regards to their many years spent investigating so much of the reported bigfoot information, sightings, etc. I will have to watch it again, soon... The hunt for bigfoot continues..."
2,Disappointed,"We bought this product without ever seeing it first, what a mistake! Very disappointed at the quality and craftsmanship of this product. This wagon shakes and rattles when you pull it down the sidewalk, it is embarrasing. I really wish we would have splurged and gotten the higher priced one with the off-road wheels. Will likely dump this one on Craig's List next year and get a better product."
5,The Coolest Wagon,"My 2-year-old cousin got this wagon for Christmas and I was amazed at how fun it was. It is great for outdoors, and can easily go over all different types of terrain. It is safe because it is hard to tip over, even when you go over bumps. The high walls make it hard for children to fall out. It can teach your child to share because everyone will want a turn in the wagon and your child will have to learn to give other kids a chance. Also, like most other Radio Flyer wagons, it seems very durable if you take care of it properly."
1,Quality not up to Radio Flyer image,"I bought this wagon a year ago for my husband's birthday. To be used for hauling our grandson around the neighborhood and an occasional bag of garden soil. While the structure has held up, the finish on the wood slats has not. Within a month, and this was in July, the paint had started peeling. I have now sanded the sides down as I did not want to have my grandson sitting among paint chips."
5,great wagons,bought two of these wagons for our granchildren for christmas. these were easy to pull our grandkids in and they really enjoyed the ride.
5,A MUST READ!,"Ms. Jones has taken a tried-and-true romance plot and given it her own special magic. HOT ON HIS TRAIL is a must read and I can promise you that once you start, you won't be able to put it down. Then when you finish the book, you'll be asking for--make that demanding--stories for Shea's three intriguing brothers, Boone, Dean and Clint."
2,Not specific enough,"I found this book to be good for novices, but it lacks in-depth information about treatment. For instance, under parasite control it says ""talk to your veterinarian"" No list of common wormers, their activity, safety and recommended dosing schedule. At least here in Guatemala, the vet prefers for you to participate in the possible diagnoses and treatment options to make an informed decision. This book leaves me in the cold. I recommend you check out Dr. Giffin's manual for horse owners - much more detailed."
3,"good reference book, but...","Being a new horse owner, I found this book somewhat helpful. A multitude of horse illnesses, injuries and conditions are described in an easy to understand language making it a good reference book.However, this book would have been greatly improved if there were photos of each of the conditions described (there are none).It also would have been helpful if there were an index to look up conditions by their major or most common symptoms, something a horse owner can reference if their horse is ill or injured."
4,At Home Vet,"You can't go wrong with this book. Put your mind at ease knowing exactly what's wrong with your horse. I'm not a Vet, however, this manual helps me to understand what my Vet is telling me."
1,What the....?,This was one of the dumbest books I have ever read! I would have been more entertained by Dr. Seuss!
1,Horny is corny!,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read! It lacked depth and was plotless, confusing, and a lot of gibberish. Some of the situations were pointless and unreal. I would not recommend this bok to anyone. I can't believe that this author wrote for popular magazines!"
5,Please don't take them off the market,"I feel this picture paper and all the preforated printer sheets by Kodak are very useful. I am pretty pathetic at cutting a straight line, so I am sure I need not say anymore.I hope they never take them off the market."
3,better for bigger heads,"I have a medium sized-head for a woman (I'm 5'9"" medium build) and this moves around too much. I think if my head were bigger it would stay put better. Looks great and wide brim helps with lateral exposure."
1,OUCH!,"This is well made visor (except for the white piping it was very attractive). The bill is large but that is not it's problem. The problem is that it digs into your head SO HARD that it is impossible to wear. It hurts like heck! I have an average - 22"" - head and have worn visors for twenty something years. You used to be able to pick up the plastic ones for 99 cents and they worked just fine - those days are over! Unless you have a very small and very hard head this will not work for you. I wish they would re-size their forms and make this thing wearable for normal people!"
4,"Shorter than expected, but comfortable","The visor is shorter than I expected, but it is comfortable and fits snugly without inducing a headache. It arrived on schedule and intact without any smudges or tears. The black color pictured is true black, yay! I'll keep and use it... wishing it were about an inch longer."
1,poorly made,"we purchased this gate after reading many good reviews, however it is not made to hold up to every day use. it is easy to use once you learn how and convient to move for other locations. the plastic is not good quality, ours broke after 6 months in 2 places, the turning knob cracked at the screw and came right off, when i contacted the manufacturer they told me they could do nothing for me. we tried to still use it without the knob and then the plastic broke along the center peg on the plastic strip. we loved the concept of this gate, but really bummed we spent this kind of money on something with no duribility....bummed!"
1,Not happy with these retractable gates,"I bought 2 of these, within a week 1 of the metal ""pegs"" had loosened up and I had to take the whole thing apart to fix it and 1 month later, both of them broke where they will no longer lock in place. Luckily I just use them for my dogs because a child would have already fallen thru because they do not stay tight when expanded."
5,Easy way to create beautiful landscapes!,I love this book. The technique in fun and easy. Free form cutting and glueing makes this a great way to express your creativity and get great results. I am new to quilting and wanted to do something different. I am just finishing my second piece and can't believe the results! Easy directions to follow and great pictures. You will love this book!
5,Excellent step-by-step details,"The authors provide photographic examples of each step in creating various landscape quilts, including how to transfer your ideas or photographs onto paper, creating a variety of scenery, and the mechanics of doing so. Directions are clear and detailed."
5,Landscape Quilts,"I find this book to be a user friendly book for creating your own landscape quilt. It has all information you need from supplies, tools, suggested fabrics, ideas for your own theme, or using one of their landscape quilts. There are many pictures depicting the written instructions. I am looking forward to creating my own landscape quilt using this book as my guide."
3,Disappointed,"Read reviews of other landscape quilting books. There are better ones out there. I got impatient and purchased this one at a local store as it was the only landscape quilt book they had. I am now anxiously awaiting the arrival of a few books I'm hoping are better. These are pretty basic landscape quilts with decent instructions, but left me wanting more. Probably the most interesting aspect of this book is seeing Nancy's early attempts at landscape quilting along side Natalie's more masterful quilts."
1,library donation,The quilt guild that I belong to purchased 5 copies of Landscape Quilts to donate to area libraries. We enjoyed using this book at our guild class on making landscape quilts and wanted to share it with other quilters in our area.
2,Landscape Quilts by Nancy Zeiman..,"I ordered this book from 3 different vendors.the first sent me the wrong title, the second cancelled the order without informing me,the third informs me that the isbn code is wrong for this book, it does not match this title.If this book is not available it needs to be removed from Amazon.I really wanted the book and have been very frustrated. Faith Stone"
3,Disappointing,"This disappointing book, teaches you how to FUSE. I want to sew. However the portions on fabric choice, blocking, finishing, binding, and backing your work are well written and made the purchase almost worthwhile."
1,Stained band gave me the blues!,"This watch looked truly perfect in the picture! However, I had to send it back twice because the white part on the band, which is not made of ceramic or metal but a rubbery material, was stained with the ink from the felt from lining the blue box and pillow it sat on! The watch looks great, but both bands were dyed! Too bad, this watch was exactly what I was looking for!"
1,Not at all like Conan Doyle; try Sax Rohmer...,"There's a bit of atmosphere, hansom cabs & concerns with haberdashery -- but the stereotyped characters are way tired, the religious aspects--encompassing a good bit of so-called plot--(when not evangelical-Christian-preachy) are pretty much Intro. to Judaism 101, and the hero's skills violate Raymond Chandler so many times that I got that 'Fu Manchu' feeling that somewhere in Barker's utility belt would be just the thing to solve this horrible crime...Replete with sloppy plotting, slipshod repetitive scenes, awful characterizations--a touchy French chef! WOW! Where'd he come up with that one?--and the kind of cop-out ending that makes you wonder why you bothered to get to it.Save your money, save your time, read something else."
1,"All talk, no action","I gave up about half way through this novel.I just didn't care anymore. This novel is dull, dull, dull.Lots of historical references, but I had no feeling of being there,and no feeling of character reality."
4,Entertaining and educational,"This first book in a new series was an enjoyable read all around. The characters were likable and intriguing, and the plot moved quickly with some good twists. In addition, I learned a lot about Jewish history and culture, adding a depth the the typical murder mystery."
4,A very good debut!,"Thomas has created a marvelous cast of characters with Llewelyn, Barker, the manservant Mac, French chef Dummolard, and even the feisty Pekinese Harm. The sense of time and place of Victorian England, taking us from elegant drawing room to the Jewish ghetto and the back alleys of London add richness to the story. Because the story is told from Thomas' point of view, you share a bit of his frustration from being kept in the dark by Barker. This does make the ending seem rather abrupt. But that's a minor point when weighed against a very well written, enjoyable story. I eagerly await the next case."
4,An auspicious debut....,"""Some Danger Involved"" is the debut novel in Will Thomas' Cyrus Barker/Thomas Llewelyn Victorian mystery series. Set in the gritty streets of London, the story is told from the perspective of Thomas, who at the story's onset is contemplating suicide.Twenty-two, unemployed, recently released from prison, and mourning the recent death of his young wife, Thomas on first glance isn't the stuff of which heroes are made. However, he is an absolutely charming character - his basic honesty and integrity, his naivete, his modesty and unassuming style, and even his very Welshness - make him a delightful foil for the sophisticated and confident Barker. Barker hires Thomas as his assistant and the two set out to prevent a pogrom in the Jewish Quarter.Will Thomas knows his period, and Victorian London comes alive. The mystery element is carefully plotted and entirely satisfactory, but it is the characters that keep this novel alive. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."
3,"Impressively written, disappointing ending","I was hooked on ""Some Danger Involved"" from the very first page. It is a gripping story, very well written, with excellent characterizations, and was historically accurate. Overall, a very enjoyable read. So why the three star rating? Well, without spoiling the ending, it just didn't make any sense. A good detective story leaves hints for the clever reader as to whom the bad guy might be, but there were none. I don't mind if the antagonist is a complete surprise, which it was, but I objected to the fact that there was absolutely no reason for it to be this person over anyone else. Almost as if the auther finished the book, rolled a die and said ""ok, here's the bad guy, let's write a quick ending that pins it on him."" It's still worth the time to read this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained with a well written story."
2,It's not the original,I was hoping when I ordered this that it would be a version of the original but it's definitely not. It has clay characters in it which is not the original cartoon. I was disappointed and got rid of the movie.
5,Wind in the Willows.,"Exactly as I expected. The quality of VHS tape and packaging was great and was just as it was described. Super fast arrival, too!"
3,WRONG PICTURE,"OKAY, LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER, THE PICTURE SHOWING THE 133X MEMORY CARD IS NOT THE ONE YOU GET. YOU GET A 2 GB KINGSTON 100X MEMORY CARD. SO WHILE I AM NOT REVIEWING THE PICTURED ITEM, THE 100X MEMORY CARD WORKS FINE. 3 STARS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT I ORDERED. AMAZON GOT THE PICTURE WRONG."
5,Burst to your heart's content,"I cannot believe this card. I had PNY 60x and Lexar Platinum 80x. There is no comparison. In my Canon Digital Rebel XTi (EOS 400D), I was able to fire a 50 shot burst in Ultra-Fine JPEG format. Now, I could have kept going, but I stopped because I don't like to abuse my shutter.This card is insane in the Rebel XTi. I can't say what it will do for you, but I'm sold."
1,don't buy this,Kingston makes other cards which I suggest buying. This card is defective and has been discontinued by Kingston Tech. They were very nice and replaced the defective card for me no problem and in a short amount of time.
4,"Heavy, man, heavy","I'm reading this book because I'm maintaining an old CF app in VS 2003.Besides being a good source of information and reference material, I find it also handy when walking to lunch - due to its heft and weight, I almost feel like I'm getting away with carrying a weapon - it's as good as toting a billy club around with me!"
2,"If this book's so great, why won't the code run?","Chapter 17, UsingSQLCESample. First, the buttonAdd_Click() event wasn't added to the button, so you click away and nothing happens, until you figure it out yourself & fix it. Then, the section in the book dealing with parameters is missing from the sample code, and the DataGrid never does fill with data. This job is difficult enough without having to spend time debugging some ""expert's"" sample code!"
4,Radio Flyer Raves,As grandparents there are a few toys that make the list of toys you want to repeat by giving to the grandchildren. OUr sons adored their radio flyer wagon and played with it constantly and so we bought this one for our 3 year old grandson. The quality of the wagon is close to the original which was really awesome. Only possible improvement would be for the wheel caps to fit more secure. But our grandson rates it as his top toy he got for Christmas. I would always reccomend one of these for a gift. It will bring years of delight!!!
5,"Wow! Very little plastic used, mostly metal construction.","Wow, I haven't see a product built this well in a very long time. The wagon is all moderate guage steel - not paper thin like I would have expected. The only plastic on the whole wagon is the wheel rubber, the wheel end caps, and the pivot for the handle. I am really impressed! I'm sure my little one will get years and years of use out of this fantastic little Radio Flyer."
5,My Grandson's Wagon,"I wanted an ""Old School"" Christmas present for my Grandson...this Radio Flyer Classic Red Wagon fit the bill...he loves it."
5,Good old fashioned fun,"I had one of these when I was little, so I bought one for my kids to play with. I'm not old (33) and my kids aren't toddlers (ages 9 and 11) but they still enjoy riding down hills in the wagon and pulling things around. I think it's extending their childhood a little."
4,Slightly Damaged in Shipment,Mis-handled or not properly packaged; so slight damage in shipment; too late for me to return it for replacement (X-max present)
5,Very pleased with my purchase,It was exactly what I had in mind. Glad I didn't buy the cheaper ones.This is perfect for my 2 year old.
2,WHERE IS MADE IN AMERICA?,"When I ordered the radio flyer wagon for my grandson,I bekieved that it was made in america.But I was wrong.When the shipment came a week later,the words ""made in China""were printed in big letters on the front of the box.Also when I assembled the wagon,I noticecd that all four wheels wobbled when I pulled it along.I was very disappointed with the results.However,since my grandsons birthday was near,I decided to keep the wagon,and eventually buy some better wheels for it,Lesson for me.read the label next time. regrettably, Mark Johnson"
4,Classic Reg Wagon,We love the Radio Flyer classic wagon. We use it more than I thought we would. Our boys love going for rides in it.
4,Good wagon,"It is a good wagon but I wish the back could be higher. I did not pay attention to this issue before buying. But still a good product, my daughter likes it!"
5,LOVE THIS STUFF,"IF YOU ARE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT USING THIS LINE, DON'T! A FRIEND OF MINE SAID THAT SHE USES BARE ESCENTUALS. HER COMPLEXION LOOKS FLAWLESS. I GAVE IT A TRY, IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. I HAVE, OR HAD, CYSTIC ACNE ON MY CHIN, IT IS GONE. THE LIQUID MAKE UP ALWAYS MADE ME BREAKOUT. THIS IS THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE PRODUCT. I TRIED IT AND I AM HOOKED. I DO NOT LIKE THE MASCARA, BUT THE REST IF THE LINE IS FABULOUS. IT COVERS WELL, NOT CAKEY, OR HEAVY. IT STAYS ON, IT DOES NOT MELT OFF AFTER A FEW HOURS. I HAVE COMBINATION SKIN, WITH IT BEING MORE OILY NOW IN THE SUMMER, THE POWDER KEEPS THE SKIN SHINE FREE AND BEAUTIFUL. YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY IT TO UNDERSTAND THE WONDERS OF BARE ESCENTUALS."
5,Lawyer novel with a twist -- very entertaining,"Levy has blended the ""lawyer mystery"" with his medical knowledge and produced a really excellent suspense novel. He will undoubtedly be stuck with comparisons to Grisham, but he is a much, much better writer. The characters are believable, interesting, and varied; the story is credible and suspenseful; and the medical and legal background is thoroughly convincing."
3,Entertaining fodder to pass the time,"Legal-medico plot a la John Grisham and Robin Cook. Not the best gripping story I've read thus far, but good enough to pass the time if you've got a lot of it."
4,A Decent Suspense Story,"""Meet Dr. Michael Malone, Doctor, Lawyer, Suspect."" Someone is railroading Michael Malone - and in fighting back, the reader views substantial legal skills and astute forensic medicine. The doctor, writer Levy knows his stuff and his first novel is a decent suspense story."
1,USELESS - INSERVIBLE,"I BOUGHT IT FOR MY 5 YEARS-OLD DAUGHTER, AFTER SHE USED IT JUST 1 TIME SHE BEGGED ME ""PLEASE DAD DO NOT MAKE ME PLAY IT AGAIN, IT IS SO BORED"".!!NI LO PIENSES AMIGO¡¡ CON ESTO NUNCA VAS A APRENDER INGLÉS, ESTO NO SIRVE NI PARA COMENZAR, ES TAN POCO EL MATERIAL QUE TRAE QUE MI HIJA DE 5 AÑOS DESPUES DE USARLO UNA SOLA VEZ ME ROGÓ QUE NO SE LO PUSIERA DE NUEVO PORQUE ""ERA MUY ABURRIDO"" PARA ELLA."
4,You'll want more!!!,"I really enjoyed this book, and the fact that I know her via online made the story so much better.As I was reading, I was so anxious to know what was going to happen next, I skipped paragraphs to find out.I just couldn't wait.When you finish reading this book, I can promise you, you will want more. Like me, you will want a sequel!"
3,Knowing the author helped me enjoy this book more...,"Not the best literature I've read, but having known the author really made me enjoy the book. First print had many errors, but I believe that was fixed with the next printing."
1,Sucking C*ck For satan?,"I'll give the devil his due--the ""D-man"" alliteration in this book is an insult to Satan!THIS book seems the culmination of a trilogy that started with Internet bad-boy EminemsRevenge, was perfected for the masses by Koontzer T. Cooper, and has now been totally desecrated by newcomer Mel Hopkins, who has written a ""gripping"" New York City story with all the aplomb of a tourist from Schitzscreek Idaho who stumbled into Newark,THIS author sounds like ER's Darla Robinson, and her street ""cred"" is as compelling as a wannabe shemale on 'American Idon'...D-man makes me want to re-read T. Cooper's rip-off of the ER soon-to-be classic!"
5,Excellent Read,"I got this book about a week ago while I was ill, and read it in 5 hours. I just couldn't put it down. Anybody that likes fast paced plots that aren't tacky should get this."
5,adult page turner,"There many twists and turns in this well written adult fiction tale. An instant turn on, the story line is well thought out and moving. Lots of explicit sex and tension. Hamilton creates such strong images you can touch and be touched by all the sexual energy."
5,RATTRAPPED,"Sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll. RATTRAP doesn't have much in the way of rock 'n' roll, but there's sex and drugs in there. And murder, greed and envy. There's also friendship, families and a love story too. Something for everyone. Ms. Hamilton's acute eye for detail and ear for dialogue soon makes the reader feel like a silent witness to the events in the novel. And, like any witness, you want to find out what happened next. Its impossible to read this book slowly. RATTRAP had me rattrapped quickly, and kept me that way from beginning to ending.If it were possible to award 6 stars, this would get all 6! Highly recommended."
3,All photos but Little words,"An Excellent book for model kits builders,but if u want to know more about german tanks, this book talks too little as it meant to be photos album I think and therefore only has captions.But the quality and number of photos is really impressive."
4,Globalization's step children,"I had no idea of the extent of ""modern"" slavery. This book reveals some of globalization's losers: how people become slaves and what keeps them enslaved. Jesus wept . . .The book was delivered quickly and on time. Read it and find out how multi-national corporations, unregulated markets, and greed propigate the new slavery."
5,Telling untold stories for students,"I will use it for a supplemental reading option in a 10th grade English class. Students will have just read a pair of novels (And Then There Were None and Of Mice and Men). This is a nice addition to my library prior to assigning them a research paper on who our culture finds ""disposable."" I don't think it would be useful for younger high schoolers or middle school. Works nice for 10th ENGLISH and is written in sections - not entirely dependent on the previous section. Good stuff."
3,WHAT ABOUT MOLLY HOLLY,Why don't you people talk about how Molly Holly looks. She one hot woman. Thats why this DVD only got 3 stars. The Viva las Divas Dvd would be just 1 star becauce Molly was not there.
3,Women in bikinis. Nothing more.,"Wow. From what I'm reading of reviews about this item, you'd think they expect a company like the WWE to be making mass-circulation porn for the masses. I hardly think the WWE wants their female stars to be used in the same sentences as Aria Giovanni or Jenna Jameson (big-time porn stars, if you didn't know).This DVD is designed to show off the beautiful bodies of these athletes, and if you want hot women, this ain't a bad place to start. Have you seen Stacy Kiebler!?! DAMN!!!Lots of sultry poses, tight bods in bikinis, and sexy locations. This ain't about full sex or nudity, it's about teasing - cheap thrills, if you will. Don't take it as anything more than that, and you'll like this DVD."
2,"""Divas South Of The Border"" Review","All of the WWE's sexiest females head to Mexico for the 2004 photo shoot. It's eye candy galore as Trish Stratus, Stacy Keibler, Torrie Wilson, Sable, Lita, Dawn Marie, Victoria, Ivory, Nidia, Miss Jackie, Molly, Gail Kim, Jacqueline, and Jazz pose for provactive photographs while commenting on the importance of this magazine on their careers. If you're expecting anything more than a bunch of gorgeous ladies posing in bikinis on the beach then save your money."
2,not the best,"this dvd was good for the whole thing about the divas and the shoot. but i didnt really like the match selection i would take out the halloween fun with torrie and Dawn marie because that was gay, also i would take out the burbon street bikkini match cuz that was stupid it just showed highlights, the last thing i would take out is the sable invtational because that was also gay. i would replace them with these SmackDown: Shaniqua vs Nidia & Torrie Wilson, Raw: Fatal Four Way to Determine #1 Contender for WWE WOmens Championship at Survivor Series, Gail vs Lita vs Victoria vs Trish, the last is SmackDown: Torrie Wilson vs Nidia qith SAble as the specail Referre"
2,Why Written at All?,"This is a well-written tome. The style is witty, filled with quips and non-vampire-like skewerings. It is a light, quick read covering Le Fanu to The Exorcist and a few oddballs in between.Only problem is that the author has nothing to say. In fact, the reader is left wondering why on earth he wrote the book in the first place. He is almost completely negative in his assessment of the occult writers he has set himself to review (with the possible exception of Haggard). Bad writing, superficial plots, thin characterizations, silly philosophies, obscure metaphors, the list of criticisms goes on.Other than Bram Stoker, I am not familiar with the writers that St John Barclay reviews. Nevertheless, it is passing strange that he would wish to write a book about a subject that he detests concerning writers that he loathes.Recommendation: Don't bother."
2,I just didn't like it,"I tried. I swear I did, but I just did not like this book. I bought this book when it came out, and IMMEDIATELY traded it at the used bookstore. I skipped pages, I walked off for hours during the time I was reading it. I just could not get interested in it. Frankly, I was surprised to read the other reviews customers wrote about it. I didn't believe that the characters really cared for one another. It was all too strained for me. I like Gothic Romances, but this one I didn't. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I did at least try and finish the book. I doubt I will be reading any books by Ms. Rogers in the future. This will most likely be the first and the last book I'll read by her. Sorry, but I just didn't like it."
2,could have been better,"I was really exicted about this book at first because tomented heros and the caring heroines who save them like in ""Jane Ayre"" but I was very disappointed in this book. Yes the hero, Gideon is a tormented soul and the heroine, Lucinda is a very caring loving woman who wants to heal him and love him like he deserves, but the characters were blah. They didn't seem to be fully developed. Also the story was a bit rushed at the end. I would have liked the reason for Gideon's torment to be looked into more and maybe showed his feelings of torment and how Lucinda eased that torment more. I just didn't really enjoy this book very much. It had potential but fell short of it."
4,Will the real Mr. Rochester Please Stand up,The author admits that this book has it roots in the dark tortured Bronte romances. Her devil duke is as brooding as Heathcliff and as passionate as Mr Rochester. Misty moors and dangerous secrets weave an excellent back drop for the love story of a reluctant American heiress. I enjoyed the fact that the author wastes no time in bringing the lovers together. Neither denied their passions only events outside their control built barriers to keep them apart. While the duke's secret was easy to guess I found the knowledge enhanced the suspence. The reader who guesses will be left wondering who is who and when making the most passionate love scene a possible disaster. I highly recommend this book to all gothic fans.
5,A wonderful gothic book!,"If you love paranormal romance, especially gothics, this is the book for you. Gideon is the perfect gothic hero - dark, mysterious and hiding a secret. Ms. Rogers hides that secret until the very end of the book and kept me guessing. Lucinda is a strong heroine who is not afraid to love Gideon in spite of the fear and hatred the townspeople feel towards him. She has the strength he needs to face his demons and he is the man who can be her other half to make them both whole."
5,Great product,Quart size is $27 So gallon size is cheaper. Well worth the money. You want results spend the money. Don't be cheap. This stuff is not all chemicals. Great results with this product.Shipping was very slow.
1,does not match description,"I purposely spent more money to have a new book and this book is not new at all. Corners are worn, pages are folded, and the covers are faded and scratched. The only reason im being anal about this is because I spent the extra to have it new. Do not trust this seller's claimed conditions."
4,Good Book,"This was a good book. Jason wants to control everything and everyone. If they don't do, wear, or act as he expects them to, he basically dismisses them. Because of this, his daughter runs away at age 16 and they don't hear from her again. It isn't until her death that they find out where she had lived, had a daughter and was married. His wife can't cope with her loss and ends up in the hospital. He goes about looking for his granddaughter and each time he is a little too late. During this process, he learns more about himself and knows that he must change."
3,A Little Long In The Middle - Great Ending,"Wisdom Hunter is a book written along the same lines as The Shack. The biggest difference is Randall Arthur tells a much longer, drawn out story.Pastor Jason Faircloth is a legalistic pastor. He has driven his daugher away. Because of his rigidness, both women in his life die.The rest of the book deals with Faircloth's search of his granddaughter he's never met. He travels around the world, getting arrested and meeting interesting people while God works on his heart to break down his rigid religiousness.The ending is one for the movies, but the rest of the book is so long and boring, you'd wish you could just pick up The Shack again.I guess everything that happens to Jason Faircloth is for a purpose but, while reading it, you find yourself wishing he'd find this girl.I suppose it's built around real life: you wish you didn't have to go through the process to get to the end result.This book was provided for review by Watermouth Multnomah Publishing Group."
4,A Wise Choice,"I can not say enough good things about this absolutely wonderful book. Not only was it entertaining, it was also full of practical and profound wisdom. Along with Frank Peretti's The Visitation and Bill Myers' Blood Of Heaven, Wisdom Hunter was a page turner from begininng to end.Randall Arthur has written a book full of characters that one will come to care about and be moved by. I found myself in tears at one point in the book. I can not recall ever crying while reading a book. As I read I could hardly wait to see how everything turned out in the end, however at the same time I did not want the book to end. As I read the last few words I was almost sad that I was no longer sharing a journey with the book's main character.I am not one to reread a book once I have finished it, however along with The Visitation and The Blood Of Heaven, I do plan on rereading Wisdom Hunter. I would highly recommend this book!!!!!!"
