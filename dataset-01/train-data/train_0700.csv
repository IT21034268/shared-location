4,This soap produces great lather and doesn't dry ...,"This soap produces great lather and doesn't dry your skin out. It also has a pleasant smell. The bar is a good sized bar soap, and I've also found if you leave it in water for a while, it doesn't get too slimy like other soaps."
4,Patience needed to assemble,"The photo is deceiving as this cart is quite large once assembled and extremely sturdy. Word of caution: the cart comes with many nuts and bolts and took the better part of an evening for my husband to put together, so patience is called for."
5,"If you've never had this oatmeal, you are in for a surprise!","Just the best thing that ever happened to oatmeal! True, it takes time to cook, so it's a weekend breakfast for us, but oh, it is wonderful! We cook it with maple syrup.... Mmmmm. Stick to the ribs amazing!"
4,Merle Travis -- Folk Songs of the Hills,"The songs included on the MP3 download are only about half of the songs included on the original LP. Such favorites as Miner's Strawberries, and the Courtship of Second Cousin Claude are, sadly, missing from the MP3s. The rest of the ""Songs from the Coalmines"" that are on the MP3 are enjoyable, but are also available elsewhere."
1,heated dog bed,"i purchased this heated dog bed to take the chill off of my Lab who stays outside during the day. I cannot tell that it is even on after it has been plugged in for 8 hours. The cover is quite nice, i hope it washes well. But, as a 'heated' bed, I don't think so."
3,Works well,"I purchased two of these beds for my older, arthritic dogs. My dogs are enjoying the heat although one has problems maneuvering on it. When I took them out of the bags I noticed that one of the heating pads was a lot smaller than the other. I contacted the company and found out that they ""ran out"" of the correct size heaters so were substituting the smaller. The smaller is only 9 inches square and is not nearly big enough for the large bed. They promised to send me the correct pad as soon as their shipment arrived. If you purchase this bed, make sure they send you the large pad which measures about 10 by 16. I wouldn't have known they were sending me the wrong product if I hadn't of bought two."
2,Petmate,"Nice bed, but the heating element is VERY SMALL. Returned immediately! They need to revise the description on this item. The measurements are of the pad not the heating unit. MORE DETAILS!!"
2,Adequate but definitely not the best.,"I guess the saying 'you get what you pay for' is correct in this case. The bed itself is fairly large with a comfortable mattress and a slipcover with a very soft microfiber plush type feel. The heating unit included is about 12"" square and you just place it inside the slip cover, so do not expect it to warm the whole bed, it's not large enough to cover the whole mattress area. That said, we put it in a large dog house on our covered patio and our elderly German Shepherd mix loves it. He's been sleeping on it for about two weeks now and obviously he likes it. I am just concerned that it keeps him warm enough when it gets really cold outside."
1,Rip off,"Heating pad was a quarter of the size of the bed and broke after 7 weeks of use. Called to return/replace and they said the will send another after 14 business days. Meantime, my pets are freezing. #Furious"
3,"Cheaply made, but the dogs love it.","I purchased this bed for our lab mix and basset mix that love to lay in front of the space heater. Out of the package, my first impression was ""I can't believe I paid $50 for this!"" The outer cover, altough it looks very fuzzy, is so thin you can literally watch TV through the material. The egg crate padding is not the quality that you would put on your own bed, it seems more like the accoustic grade egg crate. The heating pad does warm the bed nicely and our dogs love that. I do not expect this bed to last long, however, we have only had it for a few hours so it is a bit early to say. I definately think for the price they could beef up the quality. Would I purchase this bed again? No."
3,I didn't like how they Bunched.,I felt they were more like tights. They showed the lines around the ankle and so I wasself conscious. And the color was lighter then I thought. thanks Roxy
3,"Good construction, somewhat uncomfortable","I almost always buy Clarks and will continue to do so. This is probably the only shoe I have ever bought by the company that just doesn't seem very comfortable. Not bad for days when I'm just sitting around the office, but not recommended for actually walking around a lot."
1,read the original!!,"Why in the world would anybody spend time reading this piece of garbage? Take a little more time and read the classic, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is NOT a hard read, it is exciting, and full of adventure, and my 9 year old sister understands it all. Why do you have to have a dog tell you the story to make it interesting?"
3,Soundtrack!,"We ordered this after hearing the ""s'wonderful, my baby"" song on the excellent German film ""Mostly Martha"". (Avoid the American knockoff film ""No Reservations"" at all costs). That's how infectious his music is. However, the other songs soon became repetitive and uncompelling. We felt that this was like buying an LP record or CD just to get the hit single. Buon Appetito!"
3,so so game,I bought this for my kids because they love the original frogger...they don`t think it`s great ...it`s alright. from a scale 1 to 100 we give it an 80.
5,Frankie Beverly and Maze,"I recently saw Frankie Beverly and Maze in concert and enjoyed every minute of it. I realized at that time that I only had one CD of theirs and that I wanted more. So I bought the Anthology and Greatest Hits. I remembered how much I like the group when I saw them. They haven't had a new CD/Album in about 20 years but they have a faithful following to support them. I love my CDs and have been listening to them regularly since they came in the mail. As one DJ said, Maze's music is for ""the grown and sexy"". That being said, it's not all mood music, much of it makes a statement that adults can relate to, some of it is dance music and some is for snuggling and telling that special someone that you love them."
5,"This CD is the best, I love it.",The CD was well put together. The music and melody sounds so wonderful until you are just so relaxed and into the groove.
4,It's over?,"I can't believe this series only went 7 volumes (and anyone who's reviewing the series as a whole here is mean because some of us haven't read vol 7 yet). As others have said, the artwork throughout has been amazing. Although there was some stylistic changes when the writers switched, I probably wouldn't have noticed if the intro hadn't highlighted it. What makes the short series even more of a disappointment is that I didn't think that the story warmed up until volumes 5 and 6 where the characters, especially Esclipse and Raenef showed tremendous growth...Very sad to see it end."
5,Brilliant work from Billy,"Whiplash smile may not rock like Rebel Yell, but it sure packs good kick. I cannot think of a track I don't like or I find dull. This is a classic Idol, nothing as fancy as Cyberpunk, but with wonderfully put together songs. Very good instrumental work as well, goes to prove Steve Stevens knew what he was doing, you can feel his style throughout the album. Idol did show on the next albums he can do without Steve, but I think true Idol fans missed him.If you like Billy Idol, even a little, get this album. Chances are you will like him more after you listened to this. Trust me, the money will be well spent. I bought it for about double the money a couple of years back from London, but I think it is worth every penny, so you have a bargain here."
2,Whiplash,"It wasn't the best Billy Idol album I've listened to, Nothing can beat White Wedding. I wouldn't suggest it as a good buy."
4,GREAT TRIBUTE TO ELVIS,"Whiplash Smile is infused with the spirit of Elvis Presley, best demonstrated by the delectable ""To Be A Lover"" with its moody riff, rousing buildup, girl chorus and addictive melody and ""Sweet Sixteen"", a lovely lilting ballad that recalls those dreamy pop songs from the sixties. None of the other tracks quite lives up to these two gems, but there's merit in the rocking ""World's Forgotten Boy"" and ""Don't Need a Gun"" with its great guitar work and swirling synths, which also namechecks Elvis, Johnny Ray and Gene Vincent. As a tribute to the King, this is an excellent piece of 80s poprock which has aged well."
2,A Miss For My Favorite Idol,"You might have bought this album because you saw the album cover as a shirt in Hot Topic and thought it looked cool. If that's the case, you should go buy Idol's Greatest Hits instead, because this album only has a few truly great songs on it. ""To Be a Lover"" was the big hit here, but the best track is the six minute long ""Don't Need a Gun"" (which was subsequently trimmed down for radio; this album version is better). Also, this was Idol's follow-up to his uber-successful ""Rebel Yell"" album; ""Whiplash Smile"" seems to go out of its way to be edgier in stark contrast to his previous album. All the songs are OK, but nothing there's not enough to make you say, ""That was AWESOME!"" once you're done with it. Good title, though."
5,One of Billy Idol's best,"I am a big fan of Billy Idol and feel that ""Whiplash Smile"" is his best work. I also think it is the best quality of sound also, especially on album. I highly recommend this album for those who love 80's music, rock, and Billy Idol."
4,No problems,"I'm not sure what self centering means. Yes there is a nickel sized, two nickel thick protrusion on the face, but you still have to place the velcro pad in the right spot. There is so much velcro that it will hold in any spot. There is no 'self' centering.Anyway, the part feels very high quality and the velcro is very secure."
3,It is OK,Not what I expected. and unable to mount it on my hand toolI gave up using it.May be I will try later
3,different than pictured,"Well, I haven't tried the backing plate out yet, and I'm sure it will be sufficient...but, I'm just really disappointed in the quality considering this thing cost darn near $20 with shipping. In the picture its red, white, and black with a steel threaded shaft. What I got was all 100% black-with no steel reinforced threads. Just a small hunk of plastic with some velcro glued on it. I was wondering what the whole ""patented self centering system"" was all about because there's no explanation about it. Well, their ""patented system"" is just a nub of plastic that sticks outta the velcro in the center about 3/16"". So this will probably only work with meguire's pads, or any others that have a hole in the center of the velcro. Seems like it sticks out way too far to me-an obstruction...I'm not saying the plate is junk and I'm sure it will work, just disappointed in the quality considering that meguire's usually puts out great products."
1,Gintaras,One of the best various artists compilations from nativestate records . I recommend to purchase all relaeases from them - they all are very good.
5,daily words of wisdom and encouragement,"I love this recovery meditation book. Everyday it speaks to my soul. It seems to magically address my needs and concerns about raising children. A great way to begin each day centered and with a gentle spiritual suggestion. The author starts each entry with a short quote and then expands on the spritual challenges of being a mother. the book is a lovely gift for any mother, but especially those in recovery."
4,Shipped quickly,"The DVD is for a gift, so I did not view it, but the merchandise came within just a few days, as advertised."
5,20 Month Old Loved It!,We have 2 videos from this collection and my son loves them both. I love them too - the music is wonderful! So it's a win-win all the way around!
5,We Love It,"Tried this DVD on our baby when she was under 1 year of age and she didn't like it. Around 18 months she really started liking it. Great music, calm video. We have recommended it to several friends."
5,My kids love this video,"My 5 month old and my 3 1/2 year old just love this series of videos. They find them very entertaining. My 3 1/2 year old asks to watch it quite often. He loves the music and has learned the words to each of the songs. This is important to me because of the Christian messages contained in the lyrics.I like the option of changing the narrators voice to adult or child.The video also shows children of different ethnicity and children with disabilities,this I feel is very important because it has prompted my 3 1/2 year old to ask many important questions.No, they are not as professionally made as the Baby Einstein videos, however I feel the message of the music and the visuals used are more important than the quality.I highly recommend this series of videos."
1,ugh!,"I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big ""thumbs down"". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!"
2,Disappointed in DVD,"I bought the Praise Baby DVD and was very disappointed in the content. I was expecting music that would keep my baby's attention, but the DVD was actually slow and boring. While some of the visuals were interesting, I dind't feel like the video was very educational although I liked the Christian aspect. However I have found some better Christian products in the market."
4,Good DVD for 6-18 month olds,"My little girl loves music, and I wanted her to be enriched spiritually so I bought this and it didn't disappoint. She still watches it, especially before nap and bed time as a way to wind her down. This DVD has many animals like a lion, and a monkeyish animal, and has emphasis on the alphabet and numbers. I would recommend this to any parent with children about 6 to 18 months old."
3,ok,"I like this movie, I thought it would have a little more interaction with the kids, like telling them about Jesus! But they sing songs and abc's flash across the screen."
4,Twins love it!!!,"I bought this for my twin grandsons about a month ago. They were six months old at the time. They LOVE IT!!! The music is soothing, the picutures enthrall them, and all the time their spirits are being nurtured and fed as well. Wonderful product!!!!"
3,scratched,"This collection is a great learning tool for young kids,but the seller said it was like new and it wasn't,it was full of scratches but it does play.The movie itself is awesome!"
5,Swinging baby. . .,You want classic Lounge music? This is the perfect item to have if you entertain. Great background music for the people you invite over. Setup the Martinis and appetizers. Set the sound low.
5,Great Album,This CD is one of the greatest ones I own. The owner of the Pasta House that I work at recommended it to me and I am now hooked. I couldn't get through the week without it. Everyone should own a CD that makes them feel this good!
3,More cool than Wild,"The old adage ""You get What you paid for"" applies. There a few good songs and few bad songs. This was listed in the dance category which I think is misleading. Especially for beginners. Very few of the songs are swing dance songs."
3,"WinStar's 'Collector's Edition', not 'The Complete', though.","The big selling point of this compilation is the enhanced AC3-5.1 Dolby digital surround sountrack. It's impressive but ultimately a gimmick that doesn't add to the cartoons. (I eventually turned the sound down, but that could be an indication of my age more than anything else.) The main detraction of this set, though, is that it only includes nine out of the seventeen cartoons. Bosko's DIAMOND ANNIVERSARY EDITION: THE COMPLETE SUPERMAN COLLECTION is the one to get. It doesn't have the enhanced sound; but its prints are from the best available negatives well mastered onto DVD, and the sound is no less than what you'd expect."
3,Went to far with remastered audio,"This is a collection of great cartoons. When Disney was having trouble animating the human form, Fleischer Studios used Superman to make masterful cartoons with anitomical motion that flows as well as anything computer generated today. The problem with the collection is with the re-mastered audio. The effects are amplified to the point that they're annoying. The music retains the ""tinny"" quality that recorded music of the period has. But, instead of given a more rounded sound, the music has been made sharper. The strings almost screeching. Lastly. I think some political correctness has reared it's ugly head. I believe that some dialogue has been changed. In the first cartoon, Clark says to Perry White ""Isn't that a dangerous assignment?"" (or something to that effect) speaking of Lois. I believe that the line should be ""Isn't that a dangerous assignment for a girl?"". I could be wrong, but the line has bothered me sence I first viewed the tape."
3,Great Animation from the 40's,"The original Superman cartoons are well restored (all but one). Sadly, this DVD was transferred from tape. About half way through, there is a slight ripple where the master tape was creased. Not otherwise bad for $14.00 END"
3,Great animation. Remastered audio overdone,"This is the most beautiful example of Superman animate, and is worth the price for the stunning visuals. The problem is with the remastered soundtrack and audio effects. Instead of bringing depth and realism to the audio. The remastering has amplified the tinny quality of recorded music of this era. The audio is distracting at best, annoying at worst."
4,A good restoration of some great cartoons,"Having owned this on VHS, I can say that the restoration of both sound and color (the color was so dark that I had to change the contrast on my TV to watch it) made this DVD worthwile. These cartoons are great, and if you are a cartoon fan, then you should own this DVD."
2,Delightful presentation but dubious content,"Starting with our 3-year-old son, we have become enthusiastic fans of Veggie Tales - especially the nearly-perfect ""Are You My Neighbor?"" This one is its equal in wit and production quality, but the explicit lessons are problematic: God's love does not, alas, guarantee children's safety (check Northern Ireland for an extreme counter-example), except in so far as it is implemented by us as ""God's hands;"" and (a more abstract point) it is not God's size, relative to that of putative monsters, that shelters us. END"
2,Short video,"My Grand daughters, aged 3 and 4, love the Veggie Tales videos. I have to admit that I find them quite entertaining myself. This video, however, seemed somewhat different than most of the others we have viewed. It is quite short and the storyline is very weak compared to the other Veggie Tale videos we have. I fine the Veggie Tales videos both educational as well as entertaining but would place this particular video near the bottom of their releases."
5,Kids love VeggieTales,I got this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. She absolutely loves it and sings the songs. She especially likes the song about God is Bigger Than the Boogie Man.
4,Can God Squirt Slime Out Of His Ears?,"This is the video that ducks the big question ""Can god squirt slime out of his ears?"". Since that never gets answered, I guess my curiosity will have to go unabaitedI find this to be one of the least enjoyable of the series; however, my toddler son absolutely lights up everytime here hears the ""God Is Bigger Than The Boogieman"" son- and it is his opinion that matters most I'm sure.An added bonus is the ""Water Buffalo Song"", which is also my son's favorite of the Silly Songs With Larry.The second half of the video is the retelling of Daniel in the Lion's Den. Though not as as funny as some of their episodes, the wise men's song in this is as good as anything written for a broadway musical comedy and makes the whole thing worthwhile."
5,Great Movie,"I love these videos, especially Where's God When I'm Scared? My little 4 year old sister loves them, and I can actually watch them with her, and she loves to sing along. I also like that they don't shove God in your face. They are christian, but not obnoxiously so. They parody stories from the bible, but also from pop culture (Gilligans Island, etc.) I would tell anyone that this is a series of videos you can't go wrong buying."
3,"just ok, nothing to write home about -- 2.5 stars","Most kids are scared of the ""monsters in the closet and under the bed"".I bought this as a gift for such a kid and I was hoping it wouldhelp greatly. The story stated a truth -- GOD is bigger than anything.That is a very good reminder to adults as it encompasses every kind ofscary thing in this world. The way the DVD presented the message though,I'm not sure most young kids would be able to appreciate it enough toget over their scary thoughts. So honestly, I would NOT buy it again."
5,love!,Could these videos get any better! They are fun; they are short and to the point; they are educational! Love them!
3,"Good, but newer VeggieTales videos are better","As my family's VeggieTales collection has grown, this video has come to seem crude in comparison to Big Idea's later work. The animation is a little rough and the pacing is a little off compared to later VeggieTales videos.Nevertheless, this video is still enjoyable. ""God Is Bigger Than the Boogieman"" remains a favorite VeggieTales song for my children."
5,VeggieTales is the best childrens' Christian video ever!!!,"I am 12 yrs. old and I love VeggieTales!!! It is so cool and cute!! I go to a Christian school and all my friends love it, too. My 3 and 7 yr. old cousins love it and know all the songs by heart! I am so glad that this video was created.Than You VeggieTales!"
2,Where is God when Im scared is too scary.,I ordered this video for my 4 year old grandson that is having trouble sleeping in his room cause he is scared. After viewing thisvideo he was even more scared. He now thinks there are monsters in his closet. He did'nt think that before. Overall I think thisvideo might be too scary for a young child maybe for school age it would be better.
5,Adorable,"I love veggie tales, and this one has a good lesson! (like they all do!) Bought this for my God-son after watching it many times with my girls."
5,"""VeggieTales"" are the best!","I'm a 36-year-old mom and I adore ""VeggieTales""! It's hard to pick a favorite video in the series, but ""Where's God When I'm S-Scared?"" is one of their most special videos, because it was the first in the series. The ""Daniel and the Lion's Den"" episode is especially well-made and has some beautiful music and narration. But I'd recommend ANY of the videos--you'll love 'em!"
5,Great Movie,Recently bought it for a birthday present. Was not disapointed and was a big hit. Fast shipping and no problems.
4,Great for Family Gatherings,I think all of the VeggieTale videos are great and this one ranks with the best. I purchased it to help a youngster overcome his fears.
5,very satisfied customer,This came here in excellent condition and was here way sooner than i ever expected. Will definitaley order from this place again! Plus veggie tales is just awesome no matter how old you are
5,Veggie Tales -- Always A Winner with Kids,This video is great to help kids realize that God is with them when they are afraid.
4,"Surender Cinema, surrendered because it was really good instead of awful","Charles Band's cheap horror studio, Full Moon Releasing, started a brand called Surrender Cinema. The movies each came in three versions, unedited for home video, R rated for late night cable, and almost PG for video stores. The PG videos were released first and got terrible reviews. They have since gone out of print. The R version we currently have is much better with inventive direction by Gary Graver and a lot of excitement from Julia Ann as an alien from the future persuing love in 1998 Hollywood as an underwear model and stripper."
4,Wonderful,"This notepad is great. It's a convenient size and the paper is a nice weight. At the bottom of each page, there is another Anne Taintor saying (eight total). I gave it 4 stars b/c it's a little pricey, but I like it."
1,"Nice outside, cheap plastic inside - BROKE","Used this for outside emergency acess for about two months. Worked great until I dropped it once and the plastic ""guts"" broke into pieces. Took it apart to see if I could realign something to fix it but the 5 numbers I was using as the combo had all broken internally. Bad design by my standards, I would think it should withstand a drop from 3 feet and survive."
4,Simple!,Easy to use. Hope it stands up to the winter!Our previous lock box was made with a plastic door opening latch that did not make it past the winter.
5,Good security option,"This type of lockbox fits our firm's needs to a ""T."" Easy to program and doesn't require electronic lockbox key to open. Very simple!"
1,Had to return the product to Amazon,"I bought this to use for putting our home up for sale. The first day realtors visited and couldn't get it to work. The last visit of the day, the realtor called me afterward and said it had been opened when he got there, and he couldn't close it!Amazon was good about taking a return, but the house is up for sale still tomorrow, and now I don't have a working lock box!!!!"
1,Not trustworthy - broke within 8 months - used three times,I bought this box to hide a spare key. It's been used exactly three times. I forgot a key. Tried it access the box in -12 degree weather and had to cut he small try to take the box off the tree in order to get to a warm place to get the release button to work while accessing the code.It took over an hour for the box to accept my code. The open button does not fit well.The release button broke off as did the small covers over the springs that activate the codes. THIS IS AN UNRELIABLE PRODUCT.I am definitely going to contact the company. I would not recommend this product to anybody who is using this product outside.
4,easy to use,Purchased this item to hold keys to our rental property. Found the instructions easy to follow. Holds 3 keys easily but the numbers on the front are the same color as the background making it hard to read for those of us who are sight challenged.
3,Fine,"I bought 2 of these and one is great the other one kinda sticks. I guess luck of the draw. Still works, but you have to do the code 2 or sometimes 3 times to close it. It's not because there are to many keys because it happens even when there is only 1 key in it. ???"
1,No car keys.,"How freak'n obvious is it to make this large enough for at least one car key? They say 3 keys, ya maybe keys for luggage locks. It won't even fit one car key. The spec says 6 inches long, but is not representative of the sorts of keys it can hold. I need a place to store my car key while I surf. This missed the point."
1,Code sticker was placed upside-down; company has no contact info,"I would consider this an OK product were it not for two things:1. The inner sticker that designates the number for each button was placed upside-down by whatever rocket scientist was hired to place the sticker. I cannot believe the level of incompetence that produced this outcome, but there you are.2. Good luck contacting the company. Go to ""gesecurity.com"", which is the only contact info listed on the product packaging and inserts, and you are directed to additional websites with product brands having nothing to do with the name of this product.A pox on GE for both #1 and #2. The frustration at not being able to contact the company has made me rate this especially low."
4,Does its job,"The keysafe seems to be doing its job perfectly. One caveat: one reason I chose this one was because I thought the 10-digit design would make it a more complex lock and therefore safer. However, I discovered that it is not any more secure than a standard 3-digit lock, since the order in which the numbers are entered into the lock is irrelevant. Overall, though, I am happy with the product."
4,Iconic music for an expat,"Stomping Tom is one of those truly Canadian icons for me. When I'm feeling a bit lost, away from home, I can crank up ""Bud the Spud"" or ""A Sudbury Saturday Night"" and find myself not just transported home to Canada but to a time and place where my ignorance of the greater world was the best protection money could buy. There was a long time in Canada where our transition into a country was felt by us all. The process isn't finished but you can relive the brilliant possibilities with the Stomping Tom collection."
5,The 1st is the Best,"During a difficult time in the early 80's this music was so inspiring.It took a while to find again in 2007 but it was worth the search!I especially like ""You Comfort Me""Very soothing!"
4,Valuable reference on Northwest Territory history,"Superb source of everyman's history, by a Hoosier who attended the Indianapolis School for the Blind in the 19th century."
4,A good book with an unsympathetic heroine,"The plot is simple and explained elsewhere. There's really no mystery after a bit, as the reader more-or-less knows, along with the heroine, what the basic truth is, but we just don't know the details.The prose is well crafted. But the explanation of how the English people on the train were part of the deception is weakly and unsatisfactorily explained. The heroine, who starts out as an unlikeable spoiled brat, continues that way through most of the book and at the end I felt sorry for her new boyfriend.I would like to see the Hitchcock movie, which I believe could be much better than the book."
4,Thank's,"I was worried at first order from Japan.When this item has arrived to Japan, but the case was cracked, no problems to play music, is pleased"
1,Wrong items,"I ordered this item, ignorning someone else's review that they got the wrong cable. Figured that was just a fluke. I ordered two of them, expecting a Male/Female connection, as described. Instead, I received two cables, both of which were Male/Male. Buyer beware."
3,Not an extension cable,"As another reviewer wrote, this 15' cable is not as described. It is not m/f, which is what it would have to be to be an extension cable, it is m/m. That works for my application, since it is long enough to reach the monitor in my recording booth either way, so I am not returning it. But be aware it is not as described."
2,Too Academic,"Not was I was looking for. The author seems to me to be in love with his own writing which is often arcane and old-fashioned. Very wordy, and not an easy read. I gave up after the first two chapters."
2,Useful but limitated,I think that this book is very usefull but I think it is limitated.It is a review of the history of swearing. It can be funny in some ways but sometimes it is hard to read because it is written as a text book.We can find many pictures a tables resuming the info that are very interesting.In general it is a good book.
4,it was great,"When i read the book i couldn't put the book down, it was so good i recomend it to anyone."
3,"Big, Not Real Robust","I thought this backpack would fit my needs, and it does - barely. It also barely holds my 15.2"" widescreen notebook - the zippers stretch around it. The main compartment is big enough to hold a lot of gear tho. It is thick enough to comfortably hold a full size DSLR (eg, or say a 20D with battery grip)Overall not as well constructed as my Canon backpack, but bigger, and holds my computer. It fits under an airline seat and barely in the overhead - you might have to pull the computer or empty the outside top pocket. One of the straps started coming apart after two months of light use (carry it to work daily). But for the price, I don't expect it to last forever."
1,Horrible,"I ordered the bag through Amazon and was really excited about getting a new camera bag. When I opened the box I had no idea that bag was going to be so large. It is huge, bulky, and unrealistic. If I would have known the bag was so misrepresented online I would not have gotten it.When I tried to return I noticed that there was no packing slip. I called Lowpro...no answer. I wrote emails to Lowpreo... no answer. Weeks later when I finally managed, through amazon, to find them they sent me their ""new adress"" to send the iteam back. I sent the bag over a week ago to the address that I was given. That address does not true and I have not been payed back for thrying to return the bag. All in all this is a horrible product with a horrible company."
5,Ausgezeichnet!,"I used to own a 33 LP record of this group, but that is ancient history. I finally bought this CD, and the music is as ""wunderbar"" as I remembered. Songs are a good blend of familiar and new and always performed with great skill. Worth your dollars!"
5,Is the film lost??,"Maybe this is a rumor, or maybe not. I have no facts to back this up... but I heard the reason this movie is not available on DVD, or new on VHS for that matter, is because the original film footage is lost or stolen.I purchased a VHS version ""used"" here before for a reasonable cost, and it was a dub copy, so I sent it back. Now I wish I kept it! I think most of the original VHS copies floating around are rental shop copies, which they charged the $80 price tag for."
5,Look at These Reviews!!!,"I have yet to meet a person who has even heard of this movie, even though Crispin made a famous appearance on Letterman pretty much in his ""Rubin"" persona. This is such a great movie for anyone who likes movies that are not massive blockbusters simply because they appeal to the ""America's Top 40"" crowd. For those of you who like movies because they are brilliantly written and directed, have a great story and some great acting, This is a winner. I know it will never make it to Blu-Ray, but if it did I would be first in line! When you see a little known movie getting these kinds of reviews, it is for a reason! Also, if you can get your hands on Crispin's Album ""The Big Problem Does Not Equal The Solution, The Solution Equals Let It Be"", there are photos taken of him as Rubin, as well as some songs that refer back to the movie. Crispin is one strange cat, but he is a great entertainer, and personally I think that this is his best movie."
4,Genius persuasion,"it seems as though every site I've seen where viewers whine about DVD availability, other similar reviews begin to pile up. A year or so later, Poof! At least, that's what happened with Pee-wee's Big Adventure. So, here goes... Why isn't this movie on DVD? Let's get some service!"
5,Hanro cotton rib boxer brief,"This is the most comfortable boxer brief around. It costs a lot, but is worth every penny. It never loses its shape and will still look and feel new for several years. A definite buy!"
5,Letter Perfect,"Segre` has written two excellect histories for the educated non-scientist. These are not ""light"" reads, but they are informative and entertaining. This is the second part of the pair (the first, ""From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves"") and is just exciting as the first. One could almost call this work, ""The Story Continues"". It tells of scientists working for years on end in attempts to understand the universe and its workings. Of course, we meet those geniuses that discovered a new aspect of reality or a long-sought explanation.What is remarkable is how these great men and women used the work of each other to further their own endeavors. The practice of documenting new find and publishing scientific journals began during this era. Exquisite writine with diagrams, photographs and illustrations."
5,Wondeful book!,"This is a wonderful book. I'm glad it's back in print again. Highly recommended, together with ""From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves""."
2,Not what I expected,"Look carefully at this picture. If you're expecting a chair with a lumbar support, an adjustable frame and adjustable arms, look elsewhere."
5,Complete review about creative embroidery,"If I have to keep only one book about embroidery, I'll choose this one !It supposes though that you know how to make the different stitches, it is not a dictionnary : it is about composition and color, how to prepare original backgrounds, the use of the stitches both hand and machine. Good review of fabrics and threads and how to marry them according to your goal.Very inspirationnal pictures and close-up.It opens you the doors of creativity."
3,a pretty good CD,I have three Deleruim cd's and this one is lower on scale but is still a good cd. This one is less eletra and more drums. I'd look at other Deleruim cd's before I buy. Listen to the samples. What you here is what you get.
4,A kids review,This game is pretty good. the pros are that you can play as all 4 turtles. You can face Zanramon the Triceraton leader and the Shredder. Overall this game is fairly easy and I reccomend you can buy it.
3,TRIED TOO HARD,The third instalment was a bad copy of the the first two. My kids lost interest by the halfway point.
4,Great effects!,Great having 3 discs. The movie lived up to its expectation and great in 3d. Very colourful and exciting to watch.
3,Funny,Wasn't let down. It was worth watching with the humor and of course the penguins. Great for kids and entertaining for us adults.
4,Madagascar 3,The movie is a hit! Lots of fun for the entire family. The wig addition isn't a great add. It would be if the wig was of better quality.
5,Our favorite of the Madagascars,Great movie - the kids loved playing with the wig. The combo disk sets are great for the car and house.
3,Better suited for a three year old,Same ole Madagascar. The end was a little to imaginary. More on the level of a three year old. Wasn't impressed.
4,Its a really good movie with full of entertainment,I gave it 4 completely because my children enjoyed it a lot and the quality was very good. It missed on 5 because I did not like the rewind and forward play with amazon player. Netflix is better it shows you the movie frame while scrolling.
5,great family movie,If you can get past Chris rock's annoying voice you will laugh through this whole movie. The movie is just plain funny. I love the bear's romance. We watched it twice. enjoy!
4,Nice movie for all the Family,"This movie it is very entertainment, it is great for all the family, not only for kids. I had seen the saga movies some time ago and it was very funny. This is not the exemption this is a nice movie to see.Thanks"
5,Loved it!,"Great movie!! Better than the second... perfect for an afternoon home with the kids. We thoroughly enjoyed it...and the soundtrack it good too. So easy to watch with Amazon Prime via Ruko, too. Thanks, Amazon for making it so easy."
4,Cute,Of course the story line and the plot were beyond the realm of any real belief. But the same characters (and some new ones) with their off-beat humor made it a fun afternoon.
3,Still haven't watched,Came in great condition but I haven't had a chance to watch the movie yet. I was disappointed that the wig won't fit an adult. I wanted to wear it as part of my Halloween costume
3,It's ok,It was cute like the other Madagascar movies but it wasn't as funny I would say as the others. Not as many punchlines or funny sayings just a movie about animals in the circus. It's still Disney's so it's good just not the best one
4,Madagascar 3,"Ordered this DVD as a gift for Christtmas for my great-great niece. Also,downloaded to my PC. Good movie for kids."
4,FUNNY,THIS WAS VERY ENJOYABLE!!! I RENTED IT FOR MY CLASSROOM AND ALL MY KIDDOS SEEMED TO ENJOY IT!!! GREAT SEQUEL!
5,Fun movie!,"We started out by renting this movie and my boys (2,4) loved it so much we ended up buying it."
3,Poor qualify pictures,"I like the movie even though I already saw it in the theater. However, the qualify is poor as it was copying from the internet. I would rent a DVD next time."
3,Cute show...,"Not AS great as the other Madagascar movies, but still very cute and had a decent story line. I just didn't think they followed the ""wild"" theme too much with this one. The movie quality in regular 2D was very disappointing! uzzy and blurry in spots like it was out of focus. It also froze up a couple times."
5,Love it,My kids love this movie. They watched it about ten times. Def one of their favorite movies. Cracks me up too.
2,The bonus wig won't even fit my child,"I bought this item because my kids saw the commercial and they wanted the rainbow afro wig. My youngest child was going to wear it for Halloween and I was going to make her a zebra costume. When the item arrived, I just knew this wasn't going to end well. For starters, the wig was in the same size box as the DVD combo. I was hoping it would fit them, but wasn't sure. After we opened the box, it became readily apparent that the wig was a joke. It is thin, poorly made and is not an afro, as much as it is a pale imitation of one. My child tried to wear it, but it only covers the top of her (9 year old) head like a sad toupee. She finally did figure out that it fits her one doll, but the disappointment over the bonus wig is the reason we haven't even watched the movie, yet. I know the review is mainly about the wig, but, the wig is the reason I bought the movie. It says its for ages 3 and up, but I would bet that the wig wouldn't fit a child much older than 3."
4,not as good as 2 and 3,"Even though my 5-year old daughter loved it in theaters, I thought it was not as good as #1 and #2 both of which grabbed attention of my whole family. But with addicts to kids movies I have to have it on DVD any way. Marty - the zebra voiced by Chris Rock - was exceptional!!"
2,Madagascar 3,"A pretty good movie for kids, I suggest for parents that want a good time with their children, watch this movie"
3,Well oiled machine,"In some ways, this is the best of the Madagascar movies, mainly because Alex isn't so hung up on himself through most of the movie. Yes, they are still trying to get back to New York and still find themselves in incredible situations. It still feels a bit formulaic, treading ground that is familiar to not only the previous Madagascar movies, but also feeling very similar to ""Puss-In-Boots"" and the Shrek franchise story lines. In other words, it is great for kids and has enough allusions to adult movies so that they don't regret spending time with their kids watching it. The only problem I REALLY have with the movie is that Alex and his friends lie at one point and when the lie is discovered, he brushes it off by basically saying that the ends justified the means. That argument would get the troublemaker in more hot water, not less, in my house. But it does give my family a discussion point."
3,Kids loved it...,"My children liked this movie but did not think it was the best of the Madagascar films. I usually like these movies but I found it to be a little boring, myself. I found the villain character to be rather annoying."
3,1 and 2 were better,It was cute and I did watch the whole movie but it was predictable and just not as fun as the last two movies.
3,"Good, Not Great!","The third installment of the Madagascar film was good... But will never match the first film. It was a little stupid as the character hunting the crew was practically super human, which makes it seem unfathomable as to why she fails at capturing them."
3,"Charming, But lacking a good story line.","Madagascar 3 was not really what I was hoping for, but it's still enjoyable. On the negative side, it lacked a good story line. It was very predictable and seemed like the directors were bored. I honestly felt like I was watching the trailer in a long version. Now, I don't want to be too harsh, so on to the positive side. The humor was quite funny, and it was still holding my attention. I think that kids would be laughing out loud several times at the jokes. This is what I would rate as a movie to rent a few times, but not buy for my own movie library. If one absolutely loves the Madagascar Trilogy, Madagascar 3 would be a fun edition to your collection."
2,Too Adult for the kids,"Nice story line and good plot, but too much ""adult humor"" for a kid's movie and a very noticeable euphamism for the BS term from the tiger at the end. So noticeable it seemed just as though he used the actual term."
4,Great family movie--FUNNY!,I love this movie. It is the best of the 3. The wig that came with it is cheap and falling apart but I got it for the movie itself. Adults will enjoy it more so than the kids. This is truely a funny movie to watchl
4,Madagascar Three,"Easily, the best of the three movies and one of the best animated movies ever. If you buy it, you will not be disappointed."
1,quite disappointing,Madagascars 1 and 2 were great movies with great visuals and a story that engages you from the get go.This one only has the visuals and no story whatsoever. Also it trys hard to make you laugh but fails hopelessly.I have seen this happening with other movies too were the first one or two episodes are great but they simply run out of ideas for the following chapters.
1,Rip off,$$$$5 bucks for this it's not even 5 minutes long! My wife should have read the fine print. The movie was good but this bonus feature seemed like a scam. Not happy with how amazon put this up when it first came out. My wife mistakes it for the movie... Who charges $4.99 for a 2 minute bonus feature? To make it worse now it's free!
1,don't buy this for the wig!!!,the wig that comes with this movie is the most worthless piece of c*** I have ever seen. The rows of curls are over an inch apart and when you put it on it looks like rows of short colored curls. The curls are only two inches long and it looks nothing like the wigs in the movie. I should have got the 3D movie and passed on the wig. I would recommend you do the same.
4,Simply stellar!,I am a father of 2 very picky girls (ages 8 and 5) when it comes to movies. We all absolutely loved Madagascar 3 - funny and a fun sound track to boot!
2,For sure worst of all three Madagascar movies,Of all three Madagascar movies this one is by far the most boring and overdone.Sorry the producers had to think of such an outrageous story to bring the animals backto NY. And those Russian accents.... oh boy! just horrible overall!!!
5,The kids LOVE it,This is my 5-year old niece and 2-year old nephew's favorite movie. I have the electronic version on my iPad and it is requested often.
3,Good movie but not the best one,"This is the third Madagascar movie in the series. While the movie has the same great characters, the story line is weak and lacks the action and humor of previous movies. The movie does get better near the end and is worth watching at least once."
4,Lots of fun!,"A bit too ridiculous and ""over the top"" at times. The story-line is simple and its plot is strategically written around making funny scenes. However, it is extremely funny and we laughed hard as a family. Very creative."
5,Madagascar 3,It is a fun movie for people of all ages. It was as enjoyable as Madagascar 1. Young kids will enjoy.
4,Super cute movie,"This was a great movie, we didn't get to see it at the theatres but really wanted to. So when this was on sale my mother in law got it for my son for Christmas. We watched it and it was super cute. We have all the Madagascar movies, its just a great addition."
3,Fun for the kids,It was fun for a family night night but I didn't think it was as good as 1 or 2. Kids will sTAY ENTERTAINED.
3,its okay,some funny parts like the other ones better. But if you have the other ones it goes with them too
4,Great,As with the others all fun to watch and a great family movie. This would be the perfect gift for any child for Christmas.
3,Great Movie - However the 3D DVD Disk was deffected. Amazon did respond quickly and replaced the original set.,"We enjoyed the movie, however after the first half of the movie it started stopping in the middle. We finally realized that the 3D DVD was defected, however we were able to finish watching the movie in blue ray. Amazon also acted very quickly and sent us a new 3D set and return label for the defected one. We have not had a chance to watch the new one, hopefully it will work properly. Please note, whereas the 3D DVD was defected Amazon took care of it in a timely manner. The only reason I rated it as 3 stars is that my family was very disappointed when we could not finish watching the movie in 3D and my niece was only there for the weekend. It is a very cute movie and I have always had excellent service with Amazon."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO.,The package may say funnier than the rest but I disagree. I enjoyed the first two much better. I just didn't get as many laughs out of this one as I did with the others.
2,Disappointed :(,"I loved the first Madagascar and couldnt wait for the second - as is common with sequels, I was let down a little bit. I though given the reviews this one was as awesome as the first but sadly no. It just was not very good. A bit disappointing to say the least. I had a lot of issues with various things in the story line and it just felt rushed and didnt flow well."
4,Fun movie.,Madagascar 3 was a cute movie. I think I liked it best out of the 3 in the series. Loved the end circus scene.
3,Ok movie for a Sunday afternoon.,I personally didn't like this movie that much. I was expecting more. I felt it was long. My nephews also lost interest. It is ok for a Sunday afternoon when your favorite shows are not showing.
2,skip the last 30 minutes,"not sure if they ran out of script but this movie just goes into utter nonsense at the beginning of the second circus scene as well as the grand finale. The opening chase sequence in Monte Carlo is first rate, but it goes down hill until the london circus, where it falls off the cliff"
2,Disappointed...Comparing with the first two,"The Madacasca 3 is the most well drawn among the three, the graphics are full of details and colourful, lots of action, you can tell they have spent twice the expense in creating the graphic animation. However the story plot is not as entertaining as the other two. There are scenes that I find boring and can be skipped. I think the movie suits adult aduiences better than kids, but as an adult, I find it not entertaining enough."
2,Boring,"Not very funny ...... ..... ..... ..... .... .... .... .... .... .... .,., ... ... .,, .,, ... . ."
2,Terrible,"I had extremely high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The first two were downright hilarious and I love them both. I had expected this to be just as funny, but I just found it to be more annoying. The movie started out great and there were a few laughs here and there. However, the antagonist seemed poorly thought out. If there would have been less human interaction, I probably would have liked it more. I completely understand that there has to be an antagonist somewhere in the plot, but I felt as though the woman from animal control was really overdone. She had an overly annoying personality and she felt a little forced. I've been a Dreamworks fan for a long time, and I can't wait to see what they come out with next. I just hope that I find it more pleasing than Madagascar 3. It definitely won't be making it into my collection."
1,"Well, that's $4.00 I will never get back. Horrible movie...","Against my better judgement, I rented this on Amazon Prime because of the reviews saying that ""this is the best of the three"" and complete lies like that. This movie, at best, had a few minutes of laughs surrounded by 2 hours of drudgery and inane plot lines, chase scenes and illogical villains. What is the point of this movie?I don't know if it's Ben Stiller's flat performance or the bad writing but the Lion is the least interesting character in the movie. Even the genius Chris Rock could only pull a few laughs out of this thing. The problem with Chris is that he has such an over-sized personality and voice (in a good way) that when it is paired with such tired and cliche scenes, he appears to be desperate for the laughs. As for the other characters, well, I can't even remember who they are.If you didn't care for (or were only mildly amused by) the first 2 movies, you definitely do not want to waste your time and brain cells on this one."
2,Not as good as I thought,I was expecting a better movie. The plot was a little thin and the movie was boring. The movie is definitely geared to an adult audience.
5,MADAGASCAR 3: Great Fun for KIDS up to age 10,"This is a very, very funny movie, as long as you are a kid and perhaps under age 10. Why? Because jokes are very, very silly. Animal control officer character goes thru certain events that it pushes your limits. Naturally, genius penguins and talking animals do push limits but in this movie, even those limitations are pushed further. If you have a daughter age between 2 and 10, or a boy under age 8 or 9 perhaps, you need to buy this movie. Original characters go thru extremely funny situations, learn about themselves. There is actually a character development there. Maintaining same actors for characters' voice was a great plus. This squeal was better than number 2 escape from Africa and almost on the same level as first movie. All three Madagascar movies are a must for any family with little kids. It is MUCH better fun than vulgar `kids' cartoons on TV."
3,they should have stopped at 2,"This movie made a lot of money, and it's still going but I found it to be the least entertaining of the 3 films. It had some funny moments, the Penguins continue to rock and steal every scene they're in but the rest was no good. I'd rather a film about the Penguins at this point."
3,Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"The movie was ok. Definitely not as good as the previous ones but good for children. I wish I would have just rented it, but it is good for my grandchildren to watch."
4,As good as the 2 first ones.....,If you like the first and second movie im sure you will like this one. Its notjust the story ...but the characters and the chemistry. Some reviewers justdid'nt like it....that's their problems.So grab your popcorn and get ready to enjoy this 3rd Madagascar adventure.And yes Chris rocks still rocks as the zebra...and also there is a little songin there bringing memories of the French singer Edith Piaf....Recommended
4,GOOD,i think even if your not a child you would still like it because it has a lot of comedy AND FOR THE CHILDREN THEY WOULD LOVE IT
4,Pretty funny,"Wasn't sure I would like it at the start, but I was laughing a lot by the end. A pretty funny movie"
5,"Polka dot, polka dot, afro circus!",I bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew. He loves it and especially the colorful wig that came along with it. It arrived in time for the holidays and it was a great buy and a great movie!
4,Cute!,I thoroughly enjoyed it! Very entertaining. Love the penguins! The story line was very inventive and I would watch it again
5,great for kids,"Of course the kids had already seen the movie and loved it, but still like to watch it and of course the wig was a big hit."
2,Draaaaags onnnn..,"The first film in the series was cute, and I loved the spin- off Penguins of Madagascar tv cartoon as much as my kids do. But this movie is torture. I hate fake accents, and these are the worst. Maybe kids think it's funny but it sets my teeth on edge. There are movies that parents love to watch as much as kids, but this one isn't one of them. This is a movie to put in for the kids in the other room while you do the dinner dishes."
5,Very funny and an amazing ending to their story,This movie captures all the things we love about these animals and brings them full circle. We have such fun laughing with these guys.Vendor shipped timely.
2,Don't recommand it.,We watched it with our 8 and 12 year old daughters and NONE of us cared for it. Total waste of time.
5,So loved this,"The actors,the story, the quality of the animation..where do I start? I thought this was my favorite Madagascar movie yet!"
4,Good movie!,Both my kids ages 4 and 7 enjoy this movie. They saw it several times in the theater and so I didn't hesitate to buy them the DVD which I will definatly get my money worth out of!
5,great movie,This movie is great for all ages. We sat down and watched it as a family and laughed from beginning to end.
3,eh,"not as funny as the originals and forced to meet words to submit a review, which is anti-user experience. thanks."
3,Some funny moments,"The movie is visually beautiful and has it's moments, just probably not enough moments. SEMI SPOILER: I found it odd that it opens up with Alex wanting desperately to get back to NY even though he was abck ""home"", No appearance from his father or mother.My 2 year old loves this movie and wants to watch it every night."
5,I can actually watch this movie and kids loved it.,The whole series has been decent enought for adults. Some kids movies are unwatchable for adults but this one is pretty good considering the aimed market.
2,Digital copy not available in Canada,"not said on the package, only in the very small print on the coupon where the code for the digital copy is written. Bought this in most part for the digital copy as we can take it with us when travelling. Very much a disappointment on that front."
5,The best one yet!,"Love, Love, Love it! I have to say this is the best of the 3 movies yet! A must see."
4,Good movie,"My favorite of the trilogy. I think this one was funnier, and had more heart than all the previous ones."
4,good funny movie,"kept my teens and mom laughing the whole time, we watched it more than twice.will probably buy it or rent again."
5,Funny movie,"This is a fun movie for young and old a like. We rented it twice, and decided to buy it."
4,Good family fun,"We really liked this one. The second movie was not all that great, but I will definitely buy this DVD. The kids are still singing the circus song three weeks later!"
1,screen quality with SD not HD is not money worth it,screen quality with SD not HD is not money worth itI don't recommend it with SD.there is no HD version available.
3,Da-Da-Da-CIRCUS-Da-Da-Da AFRO,"That was the best part. Thank you Chris Rock for about making me pee myself, but the rest was pretty boring. Alex's romance interest was nice, and a lovely cirque-du-soleil ending to Katy Perry's Firework, but otherwise pretty forgettable. I got more entertainment out of the YouTube circus/afro video loops."
1,Even our kids didn't like this movie.,"Our kids (almost 6 and 7) and us enjoyed the other 2 Madagascar movies, although I still think the first one was the best. Typically subsequent movies aren't as good and that was definitely the case with this one. We rented it from Redbox, but not too far into it our kids were complaining they didn't like it. We did however finish the movie but it never got bettter. It was too bright, too nonstop, and no real story. It wasn't enjoyable to watch unless you just want nonstop super bright eye candy and nothing else. Unfortunately that's what most kids seem to enjoy these days.... We were hoping for more of a story or atleast something that made sense. We wondered what people must have been on when dreaming up this movie. It was really crazy. The bad lady character in the movie was insane and really hard to watch. She made the movie even worse. We were thoroughly disappointed in it. Only a few small laughs (that only the parents caught) throughout the entire movie."
1,Hated it,They should have never made this movie. What a waste of time. Not very funny. Not very good. Not very well written.
1,Video did not work,"We put the 3d disc into our blue-ray player and it had a one inch blurry line running through it. Sent it back and the next disc had the same problem, sent it back and Amazon said they could not send a third due to the first two problems. Never got to see the film. FYI Did test blue-ray player and two other 3d movies worked just fine."
5,Madagascar 3 Europe's Most Wanted,Love this movie. Saw it in the theatre and bought it for the kids. Comes with a coupon for a free digital copy which I downloaded to my Kindle. Great deal.
5,madagascar 3,i think it's the best out of all of them!! i think it's got everything u could want in a movie!!! like i said i personnally luv it!!!
3,"Cute, but...",Not nearly the laughs as the second of the series. Cute and a few good laughs but hard to hold my attention. My 6 year old son really enjoyed it though so that's what counts.
5,Great fun movie,"Madagascar 3 is a great fun movie for both children and adults, the music was fun and upbeat. Definately a movie to add to your library."
4,Good movie,Good but like two previous ones more very good streaming quality hopefully we can keep it for more than 24 hours
4,great graphics during circus scenes.,Lots of subtle humor going on for those attuned and positive life's lessons supported . Lots of action for the kids.
5,Madagascar 3,"Love this combo set, perfect for anyone with busy kids and an ipad or iPhone, loaded like a dream & love it!"
3,A little short on laughs.,Way to many chase scenes. Not really for small children. Way too much drama.I can't remember one scene that made me LOL.
4,Great even for a third round,"Sometimes I get tired of a franchise movie, and it doesn't help that I hate Davis Schwimmer but my 5 year old and I love this movie. Martin Short as the seal is worth the rent alone!"
5,Good sequel.,Great movie for all ages. Had a good afternoon with the kids while it was raining. I would say a good purchase.
4,Good,Not as good as the first two movies in the series but still very entertaining for kids and adults alike.
2,Blue Ray Issue?,"Anyone else having an issue with the Blue Ray not working? The DVD works no problem, but I've tried two different copies (returned our first)of the blue ray in our blue ray player and it gets stuck after the initial load screen. It isn't our player because I've tried some other blue rays and they work fine.If it wasn't for this issue I'd rate this product 5 stars. The movie starts a little slow, but the middle and end are worth the wait.Update - Ok everyone having this issue I have figured out a way to fix it. I downloaded the lastest firmware for my blueray player (there was an update in July). Created an update CD, updated, and low and behold now the blue ray works."
5,Lot of fun,"I enjoyed this as much as the children did I think. It's a lot of fun to watch! Normally I don't like sequels, but this one is good."
5,Excellent Entertainment,"The birds love them. Since they have little or no flight capability they seem to identify with the flightless penguins. The colors and activities are well received, too."
5,Love this movie,I got so sick of renting this that I finally bought it. My kids watch it soooooo much! My 5 1/2 year old is always singing the songs from Madagascar 3. Moves along and keeps their attention. And mine too. :)
4,good family movie,Was looking for my 2 boys and for the kids of our frineds. It was a good choice and everyone liked it.
3,"Funny, but not as good as first.","Story was much more contrived and dumb'ed down for kids (most kids are smarter than this). That being said, it was cute and engaging but not much more than that."
2,Getting dumber the more they do of these movies,Looks like they seriously struggled to make a any kind of different storyline so much like the previous movies it was like watching the first one again. Terrible
3,Cute movie,"Madagascar 3 was pretty funny. My daughter loved it, and there were some good parts for adults, too. Good, clean, kids show."
2,This movie is not as good as the previous two!,"The movie was okay. I loved penguins & that is only reason this movie gets two stars! I just couldn't stand the bear in the movie. I am not sure why they had to chose characterless, speechless, sad, ugly bear!"
2,To crazy compared with 1 and 2,They tried to be super funny with this movie but the story become to crazy. 1st and 2nd movie are better.
3,Cute,I selected this product because my granddaughter wanted the wig. I was not impressed with wig as the size was too small even for my 4 year old grandaughter.
2,OK,didn't like this one as much as the previous films. Just didn't seem to capture our attention. Seemed a little disconnected.
5,Great service,I am very please on how fast I received my movie I was able to give it to my mom for her birthday
3,"Kids really enjoyed it, parents were bored","My kids (6 and 3) really enjoyed the movie. We saw reviews that stated this was the best of the three and would keep parents engaged. I didn't see it, as elements were added to the film that took it in more of a fantasy direction (yes I know there's talking animals) and less in the relationship direction of the first two."
3,it was good,i love the madagascar movies and this third one is no exception. but i really am sick of the premise again in this third movie that a woman is the enemy of the animals. and i especially don't like that this newest woman enemy gets down on all fours to sniff out out favorite zoo animals.
5,Fantastic,"This was fantastic, as are all of the Madagascar movies. I look forward to the next one. You are guaranteed a great movie watching experience."
4,great Christmas gift for kids and families,My grandkids all love the Madagascar series- and this one is as funny as all the others. I like the European settings as the group goes the distance once again escaping their demise.
4,Great Family flick,"This movie was great, my son liked it alot. Good story, good music, and good overall family fun. Recommend it to anyone."
4,Good DVD movie - too bad I did not see in3-D,"Did not want to see in theater as kids are older, but pleasantly surprised that I enjoyedit quite a bit on watching on DVD."
4,FUNNY,We enjoyed the show so much and clean entertainment. Hard to find movies that you can watch with children and this one was great!!
4,Surprisingly good,Usually sequels decrease in entertainment value as they progress but I'd say this one was as enjoyable as the second if not more so. The penguins and chimps make the movie.
4,Very fun,My husband and I enjoyed this one as much as the previous Madagascar movies. We laughed at so many spots and thoroughly enjoyed it.
3,Great,This installment is better than the last one! Same story line but better adventure! Great new characters added. Very fun and entertaining.
4,Best of the Three,"I have seen all three installments of Madagascar, and this is by far the best. It is a great choice for families and adults who want comedy with a sentimental component. My only criticism is that the conflict is too similar to the second film and too predictable."
3,I think they're running out of ideas,"This will keep the kids entertained for a bit, but it certainly doesn't match up wo the first two movies."
3,this franchise should take a break,This was a shameless attempt to pull a fast one on us. I was not as impressed with the plot and the jokes were lame. Please take a break and Everyone will win.
5,Good movie,"Good movie, but not the best of the Madagascars. I personally LOVE the second movie. This one is good, but the second one is still my favorite"
2,A movie for the kids,I liked the first Madagascar but dislike the subsequent movies and like this one the least of all. Maybe they should have stopped after the first one.
4,Madagascar 3 is great,"My grandkids love it (ages 7 and 6). Plenty of humor adults can appreciate as well. The French officer, who is part blood hound and part psycho, is hysterical."
1,Baaaad,This is so bad I couldn't stand to watch the entire movie. Do not waste your time or money to watch this movie.
5,The best Madagascar yet.,"The third installment of Madagascar is the best of the three in my opinion. It has amazing animation, great effects, the 3d is top notch and it made me laugh. It is a must buy."
1,STUPID,"One of the worst movies I have ever watched in my life. A complete waste of $4. I can't believe it was rated so well, I should have known better than to trust the american public. Look who they placed in office."
1,Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"I was misled by your ad! I had never heard of Madac----- before I read your review!Wow! what a great disappointment!I have learned a lesson from this experience,""Don't believe the ads, check out further before you invest time, money and anticipation!""You Should specify in cases such as this, Animated Garbage!That's my review!Jim McCullough["
3,"5-stars if you have ADD, otherwise stock up on Tylenol","Madagascar 1 was amazing. Madagascar 2 was a funny follow-up. Madagascar 3 is trying way, way too hard. I gave it 3 stars because I'm a 40+ year old, and I was nauseated by the colors and movements and would have given it 1 star. But my 10-year old loved it, so I'll combine his and my opinion. If you've seen 1 and 2, don't expect the same."
2,"Too many ""just accept it"" details!","How many times did you say ""oh yeah, right!"" even for an animated kids film? They suddenly decide after all this time to swim to Monte Carlo.... animals crash a Monte Carlo casino and get away with the money... monkeys pose as humans and fool everyone... really? a bit too much even for me and I love kids films! Way too many scenes that made me say ""OH COME ON ALREADY!"""
3,Each one seems to get worse.,"I don't like that female character.... what is she, French? Russian? Who knows. Looks like Gestapo. I don't think the role they have for that character is funny at all."
3,okay,This one did not hold my grandson's attention as well as the others. Third sequels are rarely as good.I would still recommend it as others older than my grandson (2.5 yrs.) might like it.
2,waste of time!,It was not as good as previous one. Not a funny story at all. don't waste your time with this movie!
2,Boring,It lacked interest and was just boring; I fell asleep. The character were just going through the motions without any real purpose.
5,Love it!,"This was something my daugther has been wanting, since it came out. It was for a great price too. I would tell everyone to buy this."
3,"Decent, but not horrible","Depending on what you're expecting to get from this movie is how you'll feel about it when you finish. There were a lot of aspects of this movie that I really hated, even though I expected them, but there was a few good qualities about this film. I thought Alex and the gang should have stayed in Africa with the second film, but apparently they were missing the ""good life"" in the New York Zoo. Without giving too many details, I will say that the movie takes an interesting turn with the circus, but it was visually indescribable. Definitely 3-D worthy. This was a fun movie for all ages. I gave this movie three stars because the movie was not great, but it wasn't bad. Just one of those movie franchises that may have over done it with this last one."
5,Great entertaining little movie!,We liked Madagascar 3 The best out of all the Madagascar movies. Kids were transfixed through whole thing didn't move! This in it's self was worth the price! LOL
4,love it!,my 5 year old loves all of the madagascar moies! this is a must for every kid especially 4-10 range!
4,Love the movie,The movie itself it great but the wig is a waste. It is so cheaply made that when we opened it it looked half bald already and the hair is constantly falling out so I'm always finding clumps of rainbow hair lying around after my kids wear it. Gross.
5,dvd,I love the movie it would buy again to give as a gift for my grandchildren and will watch many times
2,Soo..Sooo,"The movie was great, but the music and sound on the 3D DVD skiipped for the first 2 to 3 minutes; very annoying."
5,Great movie,"All the old friends were out to play, sharing stories of love and triumphant return to home! Love the penguins!!"
1,Defective out of the box,"This item is cheeply made , attempted to use it out of the box and the unit failed the attchments fell out during the first use they would not lock in place. The base is so lite that it needs the bottom suction cups to keep the unit from tilting over. If you don't have a smooth counter top it won't work. Returned to Amazon for a refund I would not recomend this product."
1,Returned new mixer,Mixer beats far too fast at lowest speed--would ruin many recipes. Mixer is exceptionally light for this type of mixer. It felt like it was all plastic.
1,Looks nice does not deliver,"After only using this mixer a few times, it failed. I do not know whether it is the switch or motor, but it sure is a disappointment. Kitchen Aid, here I come."
1,It lasted 10 seconds.,Bought this for the wife as a Christmas gift and it lasted about 10 seconds before it died.I saw a similar review so be careful. I don't know if this is a problem brand-wide or just with this lower-end mixer.Got (less than) what I paid for.
1,Mixed Comments!,"I bought this mixer on line to replace a 33 year old mixer that I lost in a fire. While it does do a great job mixing really heavy cookie dough, it is heavy, hard to operate, clumsy to fasten on stand, and worst of all, the eject button will not release both beaters without a struggle. My husband has a machine shop and with the aid of a plastic tap hammer was able to get the beaters out. It is a 'work horse' if that's what you need but I cannot recommend it for simplicity to use"
3,It is good for a short time,"It is about 2 years and half that I have this product and I used it this year more frequently. unfortunatelly I noticed that the beaters are getting corrosion at the welding points. Also, one of the beaters is not hooked to the head. Now I am thinking to buy a new one ."
4,Good for quick beats.. dough-not so much,"I must be one of the lucky ones.. My mixer is great. its so simple and clean looking. each of the speeds is, in fact, different. they range from ""knead"" to ""egg whites"". I have found the dough hooks to be a bit of a joke.. i tried to use them to make pizza dough... its easier just to do it by hand.. other than the dough issue, this little thing works great! I can use it for extended periods of time without motors burning up or beaters getting stuck. I was actually surprised to see all the bad reviews this machine got.pros:beats like the devil. egg whites and meringues in seconds!clean and counter worthy (aesthetically)simple to use. one dial for almost all your whipping or beating needs.cons:using for dough is a nono..would be nice to be able to lock bowl in place."
4,Quiet...it does its work....,It is a quiet stand mixer.... it does its work... i also have the west bend breadmaker so i am biased in favor of this one too...
3,"Worst mixer I've ever used, but it looks nice","The mixer looks nice and blends in well with the rest of my stainless steel kitchen decor, but does not do a good job of mixing. The beaters do not reach all the way to the bottom of the bowls, missing some dry ingredients down there each time. When making a buttercream frosting (tested many times), large chunks of (room temperature) butter remain. It's a cheap substitute for my 1950's vintage Sunbeam. I will not be purchasing West Bend appliances in the future."
4,Ideal for elderly-lightweight,I wanted to get my mother one like mine but I knew it would be much too heavy for her to lift or move. I searched for a lightweight one and found this one for her for a Christmas present. My mother likes it alot for making big batches of cookies but she doesn't use it too often. It was a great deal for about $70 when I bought it.
3,Waiting to hear from Westbend,"I received this mixer as a gift. The blades won't turn when it is turned on, so I've contacted Westbend. I will update this review based on the results (update here) when I see how they handle the issue. I don't want to return it, as no idea where the person bought it, and it is a nice looking mixer overall."
4,rusty mixer,good mixer for the price only proublum i found was you have to dry the betters as soon as you wash them or they will rust everything ealse is good!!!!!
3,"As always with Hamilton, wonderful ideas and a shoddy ending","The scope of Peter Hamilton's work is, as always, breathtaking. Even in the dying pages of the series, he finds room for a most intriguing new species. However:I think that Hamilton bit off more than he could chew with the various problems he gets the human race in, and sees no other way out than a rather simplistic, deux ex machina solution whereby a wand is figuratively waved and everything is made all better. It is sad, and as I looked at the pages of the book dwindling to the right, and realized that the characters were not coming up with anything on their own, I knew this would happen.Hamilton seems to have trouble with endings--Fallen Dragon is another example. Maybe he'd do better to stick to open ended series, where nothing need ever be truly shut down?"
4,The Naked God,"This section of the series, ""The Naked God"", is probably the best in the series next to the first two sections. The action moves fast and furious. Although it did have a ""poof"" magical ending, I enjoyed reading it. This combined with the first two sections of the book would have made an excellent series. The middle sections definitely dragged the series out longer than it had to be. A series that I read a bit at a time. A good time killer, but not a series that I absolutely couldn't have done without."
5,this dvd rules,"this dvd goes behind disturbeds meaning of life tour that supported their ""the sickness"" album. it has great special features and the original demo song ""perfect insanity"" this dvd is a must have for disturbed fans!"
3,Good DVD but...,"I lost a lot of respect for Disturbed after watching it. The treatment of one fan was especially reprehensible. David also seems to be quite a two-faced character. Overall, the DVD is of good quality and well worth the money but due to its content don't expect to view the band the same way after watching."
1,Boring!,"This DVD is horrible,not only are they bad musically but their not great to see live either."
5,The best Cuban CD I own,An incredible record. The Stars of Buena Vista may be better than the original Buena Vista Social Club recording. I own recordings of many Cuban performers - this one is my absolute favorite. Some of the tracks are also great for dancing.
1,Cheap,"this review is for the package,not the music.the disc's are housed in a cheap thin cardboard box,with no support.there is no booklet,just cd's and their artwork.this is for die-hard fans only."
1,What is the TRUE cost of these Briefs?,"Well, I would like to buy this but this page is very confusing. It lists 11.00 each and then it states SALE price of 7.50 each. Yet, when I place the items in my cart...the sale price does not appear. Very confusing to say the least.Bali is a very good name and I am sure I will be pleased BUT before I purchase..I want to know the TRUE COST!"
3,Good tummy control but not so comfortable,"I might wear these in a pinch (pardon the pun), but they are not the most comfortable tummy control panties. They dig into my legs @ the crotch when I walk (ouch!), so they'll get worn for weddings and funerals, or other times when there's more sitting than walking to be done. If you don't care @ comfort, these do have pretty good control for a light panty."
4,Good quality for the price,"Thinner fabric than I expected, but true to size. Good quality for the price, but there was a long time before it shipped."
4,Good read,"I am enjoying reading about John and Abigail Adams but I must say it can be a little dry, which is unlike David McCullough. I have not completely changed my opinion of John but I now find him more interesting."
5,More than a President,"Mr.McCullough write more. Give us more. Your work is complete, honorable and a must read for every American. The adventure starts from the very first word. A true treasure. Another patriot please, Mr.McCullough."
4,A Very Enjoyable Read,"The book might more aptly be titled, Adams In His Own Words. McCullouch does a fine job in presenting Adams as one of the more underrated of our founding fathers. His influence in declaring independence and designing our current system of government is a tribute to his historical importance. There is indeed something missing between the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial.The only problem I had with the biography was the manner in which it glossed over Adams' use of the Alien and Sedition Act, probably the most infamous action of Adams otherwise stellar life. The book also gave me pause in my appreciation of Jefferson, who now seems more like the petty, pretentious, slave owner I have long ignored."
2,"A ""good book"" but ""distracting"" in use of quotations as a storytelling ""device""","I found the excessive use of quotations so tedious and irritating that I had to put it down after reading the first hundred pages or so. It reminded me of a high school book report where all of the interspersed quotations are intended to show the teacher that the student really read the book and did the research to support their thesis.McCullough obviously did do a lot of research in writing this book and my guess is that he intended to use the characters' own words as a way to bring them and the time that they lived to life for modern readers. Unfortunately, he overdid it and all but destroyed the narrative in the process."
3,"Boring, Boring, Boring.","This book is heralded as a great book filled with the mysteries of the revolution and John Adams's part in them. I agree that I learned a lot about John Adams, but did it have to be so boring? Did the author have to quote almost every line from every letter written by the man? I love reading histories and biographies, but the author seemed to suck the life out of one that was very eventful."
5,One of the best biographies I have read.,"First of all this biography reads really well, its not dry. And it is about one of the greatest Americans. I was amazed at the contributions President Adams made to our country. I am inspired now to go on and read more about President Jefferson."
5,Secrets of the Secret Place,"An excellent resource for those desiring to know HOW to draw closer to God. Clear and honest, bite-size scriptural insights with relevant, practical application."
4,A Life Well Lived,"The book's biggest strength is that it uses many quotations of John Adams, Abigail, John Quincy Adams, and Jefferson to tell its tale. These people were intelligent and very good writers. I enjoyed the biography. I enjoyed McCullough's writing style and the leisurely pace he sets for himself. The biography clearly portrays a man who lived long, did many great things, and died at peace with himself. The book glosses over Adams' weaknesses and I thought spent way too much time on what Jefferson and Adams thought of each other, but these are minor flaws. I enjoyed Morris's biography of Roosevelt more, but this book was a good summer read and was far better than McCullough's 1776. I learned how this nation owes a great debt to this great, but flawed man."
2,Over-rated,"I am a big fan of David McCulloch's (I devoured The Great Bridge, Johnstown Flood, and Truman). I was so psyched to read John Adams but once I commenced reading it I was bored by the constant Abigale/John romance. The Revolutionary War and Adam's presidency were nearly afterthoughts. I was disappointed- I never learned anything useful from the book."
2,"David, where did the fascinating detail go","David McCullough can usually be expected to produce a monumental work which reads well as well as being historically accurate. This book reads poorly and is filled with details which are superfluous to an understanding of the man or the moment. As intriguing as ""Truman"" was, this biography is not......it fails to capture the reader and hold his interest, perhaps because the style is stilted or the persona are simply cardboard like in their depiction. It relies too little on a description of the times, and too much on platitudes which John Adams seems to b e surrounded with. David, where did that masterful presentation of history go??????"
1,"Sloppy, Lazy Work from a great author","We feel compelled to weigh in on this one since it was such a runaway best-seller during the summer of 2001. David McCullough (of Truman fame) is one of our favorite authors, and it pains us to see him on autopilot like this. A biography should be more than a convenient arrangement of the subject's personal correspondence. Yet McCullough relies almost entirely on President Adams (quite voluminous) diaries and letters to his wife. The only supporting material seems to left over from a book on Jefferson McCullough abandoned. Read this if you want to know what being John Adams was like. Don't read it if you have any interest in gaining insight into how his life fit into the great drama of the founding of America.[HistoryHouse.com]"
5,easy read,the book is an easy read and the author did a good job in his research this is an A+ book.
3,IT'S OK,AT TIMES A LITTLE TOO MUCH DETAIL FOR ME. HAVE READ A LOT OF McCULLOUGH & HAVE NOT NOTICED THIS IN HIS OTHER BOOKS? GIL MADDEN
5,Pulitzer quality...,Best book I've read this year. Worthy of another Pulitzer Prize for the author. It's as much a biography of John and Abigail Adams as it is a biography of Thomas Jefferson. The research done for this work is unparralled and this book deserves all the acclaim it is receiving and then some. The story of John Adams is the the story of America on so many different levels. History lovers and anyone who enjoys great prose should be attracted to this book. HIHGLY RECOMMENDED.
5,John Adams,Well written and deeply researched This book is all a biography can be.McCoullough is our best historian and he brings not only Adams and Jefferson and others to light but also the entire 50 years of our nations history.
2,An A&E Biography,"I thought the book was too much an A&E Biography. It was written by an admirer and failed to cover in much depth some very questionable aspects of the Adams story. The Alien and Sedition Acts, an attempt by federalist to silence the Republicans via imprisonment, got an apologetic paragraph. His midnight judicial appointments merited a paragraph. I don't remember anything from the book on how Adams mistrusted Washington during the War, how he wanted to control the war department, yet failed to muster funding for the army. And did Adams have a role in the Conway Cabal? If a pleasant reading of history is what you want, this book is it."
5,Detailed Adams family story,John Adams is a distant cousin of mine so this account is extremely interesting to me. It is a 700+ page book but every page has interesting tidbits of his thoughts and his life. If you like historical books this is definitely for you.
4,Review of Abridged Audio CD,"I received the hardcover of this book as a gift and read the first 200 pages, but put it down to read Ghost Soldiers and didn't pick it back up. I liked the detail, however, it wasn't exactly a page turner and I found it somewhat slow. I recently purchased the 9 audio CD collection and listened to it while traveling on business. I just finished the last CD and I am really glad I didn't give up on this title!I especially like the reciting of passages of letters to and from John Adams. These people had a wonderful command of language and conveyed their thoughts and emotions in beautiful detail. I also found it interesting that politicians 200 years ago had to face a scornful and vicious press, something I thought was a twentieth century phenomenon.John and Abigail Adams are wonderful role models. We can learn a lot from them by the way they handled hardship, separation, and duty. I know that I have."
5,Very Nice Work,"I was so impressed with this work and how extensively researched it was. I had just finished a kind of post modern presentation of extensively researched history and philosophy called ""West Point"" by Norman Thomas Remick (which was wonderful, by the way), so I was relishing getting back to the tradionally presented intellectual scholarship of David McCullough's ""John Adams"". I was not disappointed. It was a masterful job. He managed to make an impressive case for historians to bring John Adams into clearer focus in our American culture. Adams will now probably replace Jefferson as the currently most studied founding father. I have to wonder what new allegations will be spun about him. Will he be revisionist history's next whipping boy?"
5,John Adams brought to life,"This is a particularly vivid biography focusing not solely on the political achievements of another ""founding father""/""dead white male"", but rather on the quirks that made John Adams the person he was. McCollough pays attention to Adams' family life, his shortcomings, his talents, the things that made him human. With the Adams Papers at the Mass. Historical Archive as his main source, McCollough brings Adams to life, thoughtfully. I was thoroughly engrossed."
4,Good Biography on a Great Man,"I enjoyed reading this book emensly. It is one of those books that after you are done you feel better about yourself for reading. Although some of the reviews bring up some valid points about the downsides of this book (especially R.B. Bernstein's), I think there are many upsides to reading it as well. McCullough illustrates the time period very well. He is really able to reach down and develop a living picture of John Adams. This is not just a boring account of Adams' life, but a portrait of who he was. Another important feature of this book is that it brought up many other people who were instrumental in the US Revolution. McCullough brought up just enough information to breed even more curiosity on the issue than I already had. I think anyone interested in American history (and even those who are not) should read this book. Do not be discouraged by the size because it is written very well, and is an enjoyable read."
4,Great History,"This audio book provided a great glimpse of our founding fathers. The book goes beyond Adams to tell the story of his contemporaries as well. Although I grew a bit tired of the long quotes from letters, they did provide insight into who Adams was. My only other complaint was that at times it read like a defense of Adams. McCullough didn't seem eager to admit the warts of the man."
5,A New Light,"This book is a historical view bridged with parts of correspondents between the characters. It brings an amazingly bright softness to a President we really hardly new in deep detail. His outward hard appearance was softened in a new light. In summmary I thought that this was a phenomenal read. I loved it. Historical human insights to that era's time and philosophy accented with a deep love story between John and Abigail Adams. This is a permanent addition to my library, bravo David McCullough!"
5,Brings John (and Abigail) Adams to life.,"This is a delight. Like all of McCullough's writing, this is a well-researched, scholarly work. Also like his other books, it is a lively, fascinating story. Much of the story is based on letters between John and Abigail Adams. The biography is also a love story about this devoted couple.In April 1999, I attended a lecture given by McCullough at Michigan State University. He read from a work in progress that he called a joint biography of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. I don't know why Jefferson was dropped, but I suspect that McCullough simply liked Adams, and didn't like Jefferson. Whereas Adams is steadfast and true, Jefferson is conniving and petty. One thing is clear, no one, not Jefferson, not Washington, not Franklin, played a greater role in declaring and winning independence from England than John Adams.Like a good novelist, McCullough doesn't preach, but lets the characters do the talking. Both Abigail and John, have delightful voices."
5,Yes...,"...this is another absolutely fabulous biography, by David McCullough who wrote what remains my favorite biography, ""Truman"". As much as I enjoyed that book, I was completely thrilled to find this. Amazingly, his look at the life of our second President can stand on nearly equal ground as ""Truman"". It is just as deep and thoughtful but, honestly I think he could have done slightly better, with this one. Regardless, I highly recommend it!"
3,John Adams,"John Adams has long been one of my favorite historical figures. His life is interesting, important, and well documented. The author of this book apparently chose to write this book without reference to most of the scholarship that is available about Adams. Adams's own letters consitute the vast bulk of the reference work for this book. The thing that troubles me most about this book is its utter lack of chronological coherency. Adams's youth and young adulthood are practically skipped. The first chapter is incomprehensible in terms of chronology. Some chapters devote 40 pages to one year while in others a decade is flittered through in two or three sentences. It is very, very difficult to know what time frame is being discussed in the early chapters of the book. This is a good book, but with a little effort at placing the chapters into a chronological sequence, it could have been much better."
5,Our Founding Fathers Come To Life,"David McCollough brings John Adams to life in this long but fascinating review of our first vice president, second president and first of our nations first father and son presidents.John Adams was a one termer and from New England, but is where the similarities between The Adams and The Bushs end. Adams' son was schooled in France and was a Senator and Secretary Of State before he became President.Adams was a Lawyer and farmer in Massachusetts when he decide to take up the revolution. He embraces another farmer from down south, Thomas Jefferson. Will a friendship last through 50 years of regional and political differences?What was Benjamin Franklin like? Was Alexander Hamilton, an Adams allie?This book brings introduces us to John and Abagail Adams, their family as well as their allies and adversaries. When you think about how young our country was back then and how we have grown, you realize just how incredible this story is."
5,"It's history, it's a love story, and more","David McCullough is a remarkable writer as he has so ably demonstrated with Truman, Path Between the Seas, and The Great Bridge.It's when he get's the chance to tackle a subject as fascinating as the life of John Adams that he really shines.He tells the story of this remarkable individual and sheds light on the love story of John and Abigail. He provides insights into the founding of the country, the challenges faced in everday life at the time, and, most importantly, the power of character and integrity in true leadership.Simply put, one of the best books I've read."
4,A Tale Well Told,"This is the first David McCullough I have read, but it won't be the last! When I came to the end of it, I had the same sense of melancholy that a person feels when they've finished a good novel and just can't STAND to see it end. He did an excellent job of bringing this often-overlooked man to life and making him a more sympathetic and contributory member of the exclusive club we call the Founding Fathers. As of the time I'm writing this, the release of McCullough's ""1776"" is still a few weeks away. I CAN'T WAIT!!!"
3,John Adams review,Very well written and holds one's attention throughout the book. Loved it and will revisit the author in other writings.
5,Superb! Fascinating! Wonderful! Stupendous! Read it!,"I was curiuos about the influence of Samuel Adams on his cousin John Adams. Reading other accounts, it seems to me that Sam had a lot to do with John getting into ""politics."" In this book I didn't get the feeling that Sam was instrumental in getting John started in to American revolution and politics. Are there differing opinions on this? Can Mr. McCullogh or some reader expound on this? Thanks."
5,Great Insight,"Being related to Thomas Jefferson, I was interested in this book. Mr. McCullough offers great insight into John Adams, as politician and person. I learned things I did not know while enjoying a very good read. I believe this book brings new respect to a President who to me seemed overshadowed by Washington and Jefferson. Wonderful for history buffs. Thank you, Mr. McCullough!"
3,McCullough Becomes John Adams,"I got about 2/3 through the book before I put it down. I can understand why McCullough fills the book up with citations and references from the Adams' abundant correspondence; but when McCullough begins to use 18th century phraseology and terms in his own writing, then this is too much. This is a situation where David has ""done too much research and let his subject's writing style, in the end, influence his own."
3,"Doesn't Compare to ""Truman""","I did enjoy this book, however, it does not compare to McCullough's ""Truman"". When I finished ""Truman"" I felt like I had lost a friend. McCullough was not able to do the same with this book. I felt that too much time was devoted to Abigail. While she is key to the life of John Adams, I would rather have had more details of the political decisions John Adams made and why. This book is definitely worth the time spent reading it, and I learned much about the man and his times. If you are expecting another ""Truman"" you may be dissappointed. If you are expecting an every day biography - you will be pleased."
2,A Real Snooze,"I have been reading this book for four weeks, and I am only halfway through it. I try, but my eyes just won't stay open through the long, dreary passages that seem to go nowhere. Much of what I have read is old stuff that we learned in sixth grade; Lexington and Concord, Bunker Hill, the First Continental Congress. But this author seems to have squeezed to life out of the story and served up the empty husks."
2,"biased ,biased, biased, biased, biased, biased","Did you know John Adams could walk on water? (according to McCullough anyway) I have seldom read a more biased book from a historian of such note. Washington,Jefferson,Hamilton,Madison,Franklin,etc.,etc. Were all mean,unable,ambituous,vile men to varying degrees. Only Adams was pure. As a book on Adams it is fine but as a source on our colonial history, forget it. It could be 100% correct but I doubt it. I strongly doubt the honesty of this book. Again, it is a great book on Adams. However, I look upon it as ""The Alice Through the Looking Glass"" of history books. It is well worth the reading. But,is it likely he stood alone in character and ability?"
2,The Forgotten Founding Father -- rightfully so.,"Even David McCullough's brilliant insight and writing skills cannot elevate this competent and boring Ikon of American History beyond his deserved place as First Vice President. His life contained enough variety and excitement for a dozen men, yet he trod through it like a Civil Servant within sight of pensioned retirement. The only thing in the book more boring than the man himself are the quotations from his writings. I look forward to Mr. McCullough's next book, and hope it will concern someone more worthy of expending his time and energy."
2,Well-written but Flawed,"McCullough's obvious jealousy of Jefferson, Madison, and other Virginians who are responsible for the Declaration of Independence and Constitution makes this a flawed biography. His argument that Adams deserves the real credit for these documents is hollow and off the mark. Adams made contributions, but his role must be rated secondary."
1,DO WE REALLY NEED THIS BOOK,"The first 50 or so pages made me think that this had all be said before. Countless books have been written about Adams, now this one adds nothing new to the collection. Truman was a great book by McCullough with lots of new and interesting info, but this one is a dud, not worth the money and a absolute bore. Best used as a paperweight."
1,Dangerous President,A glib but superficial book overlooks Adam's horrible role in signing the Alien and Sedition Acts -- the most enduring threat to civil liberties in the history of the United States. This book is pleasant entertainment but not serious history.
5,A Great Read,This is one of the best books I have ever read. Itis the first book by David McCullough that I haveread and he makes the history so interesting.....like you are there. Historically I have never beeninterested too much in history but reading this ispure pleasure. I will most likely read more booksby this author.
4,John Adams- The reluctant Hero of the Constitution,"John Adams deserves more credit and praise as a signer, representative and President of the United States. This book is good-it gets a little boring in the middle, but a deserving read. I was not aware of the attitudes and hatefulness of Hamilton until I read this book. John Adams survived several major ordeals. Adams and Jefferson were the last 2 living signers of the Declaration of Independence, and both died on July 4. How ironic."
4,Great Read !!!,"I read this not knowing really anything about historical biographies or other materials related to history but I thought this book was an outstanding read. I knew the basics involving our history as a country before reading John Adams but the author included so many key points and figures that I felt I was being taught it all over again in better fashion. After the read, I thought how much ignored John Adam's is in our history as a nation. He appears stubborn at times but I like the way he kept his ground and ignored much criticism that was placed on him. He endured a lot in life and worked through much of it with the help of his wife, who also should be a prominant figure in history. Overall, if you are looking for a excellent read, pick this book up."
5,McCullough does it again!,"I thought that McCullough's Truman was about the best biography I have ever read. John Adams ranks right up there! I have read some rather harsh reviews of the book: they basically claim that McCullough falls in love with the focus of the book and that he is inaccurately biased by the infatuation. Well, I cannot comment on the accuracy as I have read little else about Adams; most of what I remember is that Adams was not entirely personable, and perhaps downright grumpy. McCullough refutes that and, most importantly, his writing is top-notch in pleasure and readability. For those that disagree with his characterization of Adams - WRITE A BETTER BOOK! (if you can!). Otherwise, accept that other interpretations of Adams may be accurate.Don't be fooled - this is a great and enjoyable book."
3,Excellent for what it says. Poor for what it leaves out.,"""John Adams"" was a pleasure to read. It is very engaging and personal. Adams was indeed a great American. However, it is largely hagiographic and simply ignores much of the evidence as to Adam's extreme failings. If you read it, I recommend ""Alexander Hamilton"" by Ron Chernow as a counterview, though I am sure there are others. I thank Mr. McCullough for making me an even more skeptical reader from now on. Overall, it is well worth reading but also very disapointing as a work of history."
5,A grear Historian,"What more can one add to the ""Cudos"" of author David McCullough. This book is a must read for all whohave an interest in early American history. As always it is well researched and written in an extremelygood style."
5,John Adams worked hard and sacrificed to make history,Reading well written biographies that carry you along like this book are the fun and easy way to learn history.
3,Ponderous,A great book if it had been edited down to a third the length. Hard slogging. Interesting subject. McCullough should have taken more care to put this book on a diet.
4,John Adams,"I'm not sure I'm qualified to review this book, especially where I'm only not even half-way thru it. It has, however, been a revelation for me due to my ignorance of US history. I find of very real interest the fact that he was born and lived in my state of Massachusetts, and that he has created the laws of the commonwealth, in addition to his other great accomplishments. I can appreciate the massive amount of research that Mr. McCullough must have done in order to write this book. It is very well done in my estimation. However, I find myself comparing this to ""Team of Leaders"" which I read fairly recently and which I found absolutely fantastic, so that will tell you where I'm coming from. It was like reading a novel. I think ""John Adams"" has a touch of the text book in it."
5,Absolutely Masterful,"As David McCullough has said, you can't ever know too much about these guys (our founders) and this presentation is a masterful way to tell us all more than we ever knew about them. There's no story in all of human history greater than the story that unfolded during the lifetime of John and Abigail Adams with all the events and people who surrounded their life. It is a must read for every American and should be required reading in history classes across the country that are taught by teachers and professors who have a passion to help young people understand the wonder of how the greatest nation on God's green earth was born."
2,Unreadable,"Obviously the author has put in countless hours of research, drafting, editing, sequencing, etc. He clearly has an unparalleled work ethic. However, in my opinion it is written in an exceptionally dry tone, making it hard to enjoy for the casual reader. I suppose that's why biographies are not as popular in general, but after reading Walter Isaacson, I know it can be done. So in the end, five stars for research and calories burned (rare in any field), 5 stars for subject matter, 2 stars for presenting it all in a way for a casual reader to stick to. I feel like I should be wearing a smoking jacket with a pipe in order to plug in."
2,Boring!,"I am amazed that more people have not commented on how extraordinarily boring this book is. I am an avid reader and a David McCullough fan, but this book is a chore to read. I rarely fail to finish any book I start, but I think this one will be going into the Goodwill bag before I get to page 300. I keep reading. I keep expecting it to get better, but it has been slow going - mostly because I invariably fall asleep after 30 - 40 pages."
2,"Good story, bad historian","This biography must be commended for taking into consideration the many aspects of a very complicated man. John Adams was not a president to be forgotten, nor a man to take for granted. Mr. McCullough has researched completely every aspect of Adams' life. But what the author fails to do is analysis the significant actions of this man's life. He is telling a story, not looking at history for its importance nor its meaning. Why did Adams think the way he did, and how was that important to the future. This book tells a nice story, but fails to challenge the mind of the reader or the misconceptions of history."
3,Disappointing,"I agree with several of the previous reviewers that this book was disappointing. After reading Truman and enjoying it tremendously, I was disappointed that this book does not live up to its predecessor. After finishing this book, I felt I had a thorough knowledge of what John Adams did and said, but this book left me with a very incomplete picture of the John Adams behind those words and actions. This is particularly evident in the motivations behind Adams' embracing the patriot cause as one reviewer previously pointed out. I also felt that this book could have been edited down a bit, that parts of it lagged. It is not a bad book and is probably worth reading. However, I had hoped for much more based on the author's previous works."
2,A bit thick,"Overrated.Boring. While 'Truman' was a masterpiece, this book does not represent McCulloughs finest hour."
2,McCullogh cheerleads for our 2nd President,"I enjoyed the book, but impartial it's not. From McCullogh's viewpoint, the reason that no one liked Adams was because everyone else was a jerk. It's a fairly blunt observation, but I don't know how else to put it.Adams was a man of integrity and history has given him short shrift, but this defense is too vigorous. According to McCullogh, Adams' failings in France and England and during his first term in office had nothing to do with Adams and all to do with Jefferson and Franklin.Never mind that Adams wasted much of his political capital in a fierce battle on what to call Washington (Mr. President).Adams was a man of integrity that kept us out of war and who was a keen architect of our form of government. But he was a lousy diplomat and an average politician."
4,Well Written History,"A common fault with most biographers is to either to polarize on the side of the subject or against the subject. McCullough tends to side with Adams in this case. For the most part this favoritism does not affect the story, Adams was undeniably a great man . However the `Alien and Sedition' acts of his period were a definite blot on his record, a blot that McCullough seems to gloss over.Aside from such minor lapses in favoritism the book still remains a excellent history. It has been well researched. McCullough has used wide use of primary source quotes to prove his points, a key indicator of a good historian. What's more McCullough also has a keen literary sense which is commonly missing in many history's."
4,A Walk into History,"This is a terrific book, providing much more information about Adams than I had ever known in the past. Clearly well researched, the real joy of the book is found in the descriptive letters exchanged by John and Abigail Adams. The love the two of them shared is powerful, and the mutual respect is obvious. The presentation of these letters allow the reader to feel a connection with the Adams that a regular history book would not allow. John Adams' love for his family and his country is clear as one reads this book. You share in his adventures and his defeats. The relationship between him and Jefferson also is interesting as the book shows the tension that exsisted between the two men, as well as the respect. I highly recommend this book."
3,A+ for Prose; C- for Scholarship and McCullough Understands,"First, this is a well written enjoyable read on one of our ""forgotten"" founding fathers ...but the scholarship, and in many respects, the cornerstone premise of the book is the Jefferson quote that McCullough uses to describe Adams ""as the colossus of independence"" ...problem is it appears Jefferson never said it and the flawed scholarship takes an important period of American history and proceeds to muddle it. Commercially, scholarship be damned, the books are selling and yet, a reader should expect more ...unfortunate."
5,"Buy it, borrow it, ...you must read this book.","Another fantastic McCullough book! I love history and this book was a joy to read. I felt as though I knew Adams as I read and wondered at the sacrifices he made for our country. The time away from family and political infighting were new things I learned about. Many of his views on party politics fit in today. If you love politics, history, or just a good biography get this book today!"
2,Not recommended,"I feel compelled to weigh in on this one since it was such a runaway best-seller during the summer of 2001. David McCullough (of Truman fame) is one of our favorite authors, and it pains us to see him on autopilot like this. A biography should be more than a convenient arrangement of the subject's personal correspondence. Yet McCullough relies almost entirely on President Adams (quite voluminous) diaries and letters to his wife. The only supporting material seems to left over from a book on Jefferson McCullough abandoned. Read this if you want to know what being John Adams was like. Don't read it if you have any interest in gaining insight into how his life fit into the great drama of the founding of America."
3,An over-rated book,"I'm sure scholars love the book, even if they quibble about points emphasized or not emphasized. For me, I'm sorry to say I got bored after the first 200 some pages. The problem is McCullough's tendency to go off on tangents: do we really need to know at length, for instance, that Ben Franklin was the darling of the French court when we're trying to focus on Adams? I liked Catherine Drinker Bowen's biography much better even if it did dwell a bit on John 's romance with Abigail. It was cogent and it moved along instead of getting bogged down."
3,Well written but made me dislike Adams,"I must say that the author is a powerful writer ans as an historian myself I appreciate his researched. But, the book bored me silly. It was tedious and his decriptions of Adams' reactions to various figures of his time showed a certain pomposity that made me dislike the man whose writings I admired. Perhaps the author made him real but I doubt the real Adams is in here."
4,The real John Adams,Very good biography of John Adams with information abaout the politics of the early days of the Republic.
5,Best Book Read in 25 Years,This is certainly one of the 10 best books I've ever read. I have recommended it to several friends and they unanimously concur. It magnificantly presents how a marriage can endure great adversity and hardship when the partners are both so dedicated to the same cause. I fell in love with Abigail!
3,The Best Boring Book I've Ever Read,"The dryness of the historical side of this had me pushing to finish the book, but it's more personal taste than a reflection on this work. Mr. McCullough indeed paints us a view of Adams that our history books did not, as well as a different perspective on Franklin and Jefferson. Who's to say one is more correct than the other. This work does leave you thinking on that matter and perhaps therein lies the strength of this book."
5,Men and Women will love this book.,"Rare is the book that appeals to both men and women and David McCullough has done this with this book that will become a part of learning in our schools and lives to come.It appealed to me because it showed a couple who were equals in a time of unequals and a deep devotion and respect that we in the year 2001 need the gentle reminder of.Have seen the author of Charlie Rose and C-SPAN which seem to be the last two places in television where books of substance are spoke of and loved. Non-fiction is my favorite. And I never get tired reading of the minds and lives of the Founding Fathers and being reminded of the virgor, and genius they shared.This book, by the way is a great book to get for reading aloud to others. We have been doing this at home, with me doing a chapter and then my husband and then our sons. PLEASE buy the book for your public library if they do not own a copy."
3,Good but Romantic Biography,"Overall this is a good book but there are times when the author's editorial comments make it clear this is a less than objective account. Some such comments contradict other books I have read and documentaries I have seen leaving me to wonder if the author here got it right. Also, the emphasis in this book is on the love story of John Adams and his wife which although touching is not something I care to read extensively about. The writing style is quite good which makes most of the book interesting."
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"This is without a doubt the worst book that I've ever read. It took me more than a month to read the book and I am the type of person to finish a book at this length in 2 weeks or less. The life of John Adams will be found boring, dry, and uninteresting to a person who takes no interest in history. However, if you are a history buff, then this is the book for you. In my opinion it's 651 pages of boredom."
4,Great piece of work,"Amazing, Fascinating, reads like a novel! If your not a big history fan, you will be after reading this book."
5,McCullough does it again!,"I bought ""John Adams"" simply because I enjoyed ""Truman."" I knew very little about John Adams and next-to-nothing about the book itself.It was a great read. McCullough skillfully weaves in correspondence between John and Abigail Adams and between Adams and Thomas Jefferson to make the story come alive.Can't wait for his next book!"
5,Entertaining and Informative AudioBook,"I really enjoyed this audiobook, listening to it while travelling to and from work. Edward Herrmann's voice combined with David McCullough's writing style made me want to keep driving just so I could keep listening.John Adams was a remarkable man and this book delves into his life in a relaxed and easy-to-follow way. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys biographies and historical works. I plan to look up more of David McCullough's works. Very enjoyable."
4,John adams,"This is what I call a slow reader. There are many names and places that you seem to remember but are not sure from where.It is interesting and well written. you can almost see the action and the places mentioned. It seems you are living in the period.Also has lots of factual information about how our country came to be --Declaration of Independence, Constitution, wars tofinally become free, and behind the scenes diplomacy. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,why not?,This is an awesome book. Why are they not teaching this John Adams to my grandchildren in public school? I highly recommend it.
5,On the Importance of Abigail Adams,"McCullough's work is first rate. It presents the American Revolution on personal terms that bring the tumult of the late 18th century to life. Its most significant contribution, however, may be the credit that McCullough necesarily gives to Adam's wife, Abigail. In a different era, she might have been a notable politician or philosopher in her own right. She was able to provide valuable counsel and much-needed comfort to a person whose influence on the architecture of the constitution has had salutory and lasting effects. We all owe her, as well as her husband, a large debt of gratitute for the stability of our government. We also owe Mr. McCullough thanks for bringing this personal and political love story to life in a very readable book."
2,"Questionable Objectivity, Good Writing","It's said that all biographers fall in love with their subjects, but McCullough is particularly guilty of this. The book is well-written and comprehensive, but McCullough skews the book too much in Adams' favor, lauding his accomplishments but minimizing some major flaws in his character and career (admiration for monarchy, distrust of popular democracy (including forcible suppression of his enemies), and his Alien and Sedition Acts that subverted the Bill of Rights).McCullough shows the same fawning admiration and lack of balance in his biography of Harry S. Truman."
4,A frank and funny adventures of a Flight Instructor.,I enjoyed this book. I am training for the initial CFI and found this book funny and a easy read. It brought back memories of my early days in aviation. I recommend this book to all pilots and to future CFIs. I thought it could have been a little longer. It is a quick day read.
1,Almost Useless,"I have one of these that I bought in a WalMart in Saint Louis, MO, in December of 2007. It doesn't work if you have more than about 2 inches of snow or if the snow at the bottom isn't dry and powdery. The way the blade is angled causes it to just glide over the top, pushing away the top layer, but leaving a packed layer at the bottom. To the three people below me who love it so much, try looking at WalMart, or better yet, come and get mine from me; you can have it."
3,A Textbook,"It is a predictable text for teacher credential students. At times, it is a bit of a struggle to stay focused, but it gets it's message across."
4,Expedition of the SEALS,"As I first picked up this book, I was expecting an exciting story about a Navy SEAL expedition and that is exactly what I got. Orr Kelly takes military action to a new level in Seals Eagle Force. If even mildly interested in the operations of the Navy SEALs, you must read this book. The plot is great and the only thing that takes away from the book is remembering all of the names of the characters and a number of misspelled words."
5,Right on target!,"Even though it is in the same genre as Keith Douglas'-'Seal Team'series it comes at it from a slightly different angle. And like a .50 cal sniper round it for sure hits the mark! The storyline, characters, and action all come together in a well written,fast paced book that is fun to read and hard to put down! I have read the previous book and look forward to the next one! This guy knows his stuff! I highly recommend this book!"
4,"A ""must have"" for the collector of American Antique silver","While not the definitive reference that Jackson's book is on English silver, the Kovels do provide an extensive listing of American silversmiths and manufacturers. A person cannot be a serious collector of American antique silver without this book."
1,"Three weeks, and no results","I been using this cream for three weeks now, and not seen any results. Your better off making it your self. All you need is Baling Soda and Castor Oil to make a paste. Thats all."
1,doesn't do what its supposed to!,"I have many moles (thanks to family genes) and i've always hated them...actually i've gotten quite a few removed for medical purposes but before that i wanted to see if i could get rid of some, so i purchased this. Plain and simple, like so many other products, it doesn't do anything than irritate your skin!"
5,It Works!,"This product does work, but I had to put a glob on the moles or warts and cover with a band aid. The instructions say massage a small amount into warts/moles but that took a lot longer to show improvement. This product does not work over night but if you can apply a liberal amount and leave a band aid on a couple of hours a day in 2 weeks you will see good results I tend to forget to put it on. so Some of my moles have gone down slowly over a few months try not to get this on too much of the surrounding skin because it will irritate it."
1,Does Not Work,I have applied the product for two months in accordance with the instructions but to no avail. Absolutely no results!
1,ADVERTISEMENT IS A BALD-FACED LIE!,"I bought two jars of this castorcream with high hopes because of the few positive reviews left. I was surprise to see how small the jars are realizing it was a good thing that I purchased two instead of one. Well, regardly of how much you buy it doesn't help the product to rid your skin of moles. AT ALL. This stuff sticks to the insideof the band aid and just lies there slowly drying up. Ahat a waste of money!!! I do not remmend anyone trying it for moles. Maybe it's better on warts."
2,Bassey is Better,"Shirley is fabulous and this recording does not do her justice. I wish there were some way to send this back. Such poor sound quality on most tracks. I read the other glowing reviews of this CD. Did I get a ""bad"" one? She deserves better."
4,Significantly Improved from 3rd Edition,"The 4th edition is much more current about methods and techniques than the 3rd edition. Materials covered span various types of tools and techniques that may be used to perform specific activities (i.e., ventilation). The description of understanding necessary for satisfactory completion of the certification exams is clearly written. Additionally, everyone who plans to pursue Fire Fighter certification in Pa. should use the 4th Ed. of ""Essentials"" because it has been selected as the reference for all testing."
5,Best training book!,"Even though the fifth edition is out, IFSTA's Essentials of Fire Fighting is the absolute best! We use this at our fire department, along with the companion DVD's for training.It is well written and easier to understand than the others.A must for every trainee, Explorer, or seasoned veteran!"
3,Shipping,"When I placed the order i placed an expedite on the order to get here sooner. However, it has been 6 days since order was placed and still no book. DO NOT PAY FOR THE EXPEDITE SERVICE....ITS A RIP OFF!!!"
4,"S.S, America U.S.S. West Point S.S. Australis: The Many Lives of a Great Ship by Lawrence Driscoll","An excellent book that brings together the three lives (and the demise) of such a great ship. Great detail, paintakingly put together. Would highly recommend it.Perhaps it could have had more photographs of the interior of the ship when she was the Australis; and should have referred to her as the R.H.M.S. Australis, not S.S Australis, otherwise a great book to have in the library."
2,"Great Ship, Great Disappointment","In the late 1950s,as a young boy of nine, I saw my aunt and uncle off for Europe on the ss America. It began my love affair with ocean liners and cruise ships. I looked forward greatly to receiving this book as a Christmas gift to add to my collection of over 150 books on liners, etc.On arrival, the book is a great disappointment. The writing style is quite amateurish. The author seems to have relied on the stories of the same few people throughout the book. The pictures are small, often unclear and never in color. The ss America deserves much better than this."
2,Not as good as I expected.,The picture was nice but the pieces were terrible to work with. I will not buy another Ravensburger puzzel.
3,Mixed,"The projects in this were less motivating, partly due to the complexity and partly due to irrelevance. Sewing skills will be improved by doing them, but perseverance is needed."
5,cute book,Very cute book. Lots of things to keep children interested and keep them wanting to learn to sew. I think older children would find the book 'dorky' and too 'childish' but for 6 - 9 year olds I don't think you could find anything better.
4,Sewing book,"Fun books to use for teaching young students to sew. A bit redundant on some lessons, but it is a teachers job to use what is needed according to the students learning levels. We did have fun with it though."
1,ENOUGH ALREADY!---(NOT A ROMANCE),"I like a titillating and juicy story, but this one borderlined on sick. There was rape on top of rape, even the attempted rape of a young girl who was already pregnant from a previous rape. Add to that women-haters, women-murderers, incest, parricide, and in-depth details on gyno exams and you have a MISERABLE combination.The characters were not likable--some were even almost unbearable. The main villain was obvious and the whole ending with the sword-in-the-stone thing was ludicrous. Top it off with a narrator (Monica Buckley) who was so bad that she sounded like a little kid trying to change her voice and you have a recipe for total disaster."
4,The Nightingale,I love this book the hero is not an ordinary romance novel hero the way she wrote this book was brillient. I love the mystery.
4,Good book,"2nd book in the ""Legacy"" triology. I enjoyed it. It didn't go down avenues that weren't relevant, it kept you guessing, good mystery thrown in, etc. IMO - I didn't like the romantic scenes, thought it got a little 'out there' at the end with the sword and I was somewhat confused at points with Caroline and North's interactions. But the overall story was good and kept me entertained."
4,great story but badly read,"The story is a typical Catherine Coulter Regency tale. However, it is very hard to follow as Monica Buckley's English Accent is atrocious. She not only can't speak with an English accent, she can't change her voice for the different characters, which makes it sometimes hard to follow as to who said what. Ms Coulter's humorous plots and scenes are lost in the reading. I'm greatly dissapointed. I listened to all the ""Bride"" novels read by Anne Flosnik, and expected the same level of quality in this production, which was not the case. It would have been better to not even attempt at the English accent, and concentrate more on changing the voices. The leading man's voice sometimes sounds like a screeching female's! I lived in England for some years, and loved it, and had hoped to be transported once again, as with Anne Flosnik, but no such luck. I'm still giving it a 4 star rating, because I like Ms Coulter's Regency tales."
2,Rape of the Sabine Women,"The Nightingale Legacy was way too heavy with the mistreatment of women for this review. Not one I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys romance, but not brutality.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS"
1,It is terrible,I dislike this book so much that I donated it to a use book sale. I bought it hardcover and I regret it so badly that I wasted my money on it. Catherine Coulter's books had been getting worse and worse. I would not bother reading anymore of her books.
4,A good rainy day read,"I am well-read on Russia, having lived there temporarily, and this book is tops. The author shows amazing insight and does not hesistate to let the reader in on her racy experiences. A steamy read for the bedroom, but not for research projects!"
2,Be Careful Here,"I would love to use this but my computer will not read the CD. Check your computer for compatibility and get the right version for your application. Until I replace my CD reader, I'll be e-mailing all of my pictures to myself and duplicating information manually on computer and on my phone. All the while this product collects dust in a drawer at my PC."
1,Yuck! Motorola Sucks... Period,"In two words ""pathetic software"". I cannot help but pity the users of this software.This was my experience. I lost my Motorola V 551, came back home and started this software. Surprise ! No backups found... my regular backups every month surprisingly could NOT be found.Luckily I did a system-wide search and located the .CDB files... So much for the $30 I spent on this @#$%@##!PRO's---------1. Uses up some of your Hard disk space (read ""Cannot think of any"")CON's-------1. Software does not work2. slow transfers via USB cable"
4,Cheaper than email,"This product has worked great thus far. I have used it to edit and download songs for ringtones, and I have used it to save/edit/sync my phone book. It has performed perfectly for these. I have not used it for photos or video. I would recommend this product for Cingular Motorola V551 phone. Much less expensive here than Cingular."
3,Variation on the King Arthur legend.,"Coney has put together an alternative perspective on the telling of the Arthur legend.Although comical at times, it does get a bit boorish at times.A good read for Arthurian fans looking for a new take on the old tale."
1,Very bad quality,"I was disappoointed when I receive this plane. Very poor quality, badly glue. It looks very cheap. I do not recommand this product, too expensive for the poor quality."
5,ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!!!!!,"As soon as I read the reviews for this video, I picked one up for not only my little sister, but also the kids I babysit. It was wonderful how much they all really enjoyed it-I must also admit I got real into it too!! I highly recommend this to everyone w/kids!"
1,Not The Best of Connick,"Aside ""It Had to be You"" and ""If I Could Write a Book,"" unfortunately the rest of the CD is not as memorable as other albums Connick has made. At times I found it lacking energy and sloppy. Connick needs to take a hint from Michael Bublé who gives crisp and understandable lyrics and originality in his songs."
5,Well produced and compelling!,"The contributing scientists to this video did a great job of explaining how they had come to a different conclusion on the matter of intelligent design vs. evolution than many of them had long held otherwise. I also appreciated the humility with which they presented their new conclusionsThey explained features of a very complex subject in a very understandable way for a non-scientist audience. Even so, I have viewed this video with visiting scholars from China. Likely as people would know, students and scholars from China grew up completely schooled in evolution as the only explanation of the origin of life. Not one single Chinese student or scholar who viewed this video with me indicated that the arguments set forth by the scientists in the video were faulty. Many indicated that they would have to re-think their positions.The graphics used in the video were remarkable too"
5,Excellent book!,"Being from Florida and actually living near Gainesville, I knew a lot about the things he talked about in this book. I found it very interesting and loved the case studies. I read it almost non-stop and did get a lot of strange looks from people around me."
5,"""Learning experience""","I've always been fascinated, as I am now with ""death"". Not psycho fascinated. More so as if I just want to find out all I can about the scientific explanation for the ""after"" so to speak. And this book did it for me. I have in my posession the older version of this book with the cover of Dr. Browning on the cover. It is by far the most interesting educational book I've ever read, and answers all my questions on forensics. It made me decide that it just may be what I want to go into as a career. Thanks!!"
5,Gripping!,"Fascinating case studies from a forensic anthropologist, including a detailed examination of his most famous cases - Pizarro, Zachary Taylor, Czar Nicholas II, and Joseph Merrick (""The Elephant Man""). A gripping read."
4,Review,"This book is pretty good, but I think I expected more science and figures. The way Dr Maples writes seems to me like he's trying to prove something, either about himself or about forensics, but he has a rather romantic style of writing, if that makes sense. In any case, a fascinating read."
2,Stilted writing style makes this a disappointment,"I have to say that I was quite disappointed with this book. The author has quite a strange style of writing, and it was so annoying that it detracted from the book to a great degree. I enjoy learning about forensic anthropology, but this book was not a good choice. 'Too many strange departures between the cases covered."
2,Ego and lack of depth gets in the way,I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money.
2,Where is the tale?,"His arrogant style makes the reading uncomfortable. I am surprised that a promising introduction followed by boring,nearly self satisfactory chapters. Most stories are just worthy of a campfire side chatter. Disappointed..."
4,Intriguing look into forensic anthropology,"This was a fascinating book. I teach with a forensic anthropologist, and she recommended it for an interesting look into the field. The book was an easy read and held my attention. It isn't for the squeamish, but if you can handle the material, it's a good choice."
4,Fascinating...,"Excellent memoir by Dr. William R. Maples, which includes details of his life, and the many fascinating cases (such as: did President Zachary Taylor die of poisoning?) that he has been called in to investigate.Interesting and informative, Dr. Maples' book makes for some interesting reading, on a subject matter (forensics) that's commonly discussed now, but wasn't at the time of publication of this book (1994)."
4,Started Slow But Picked Up Speed Rapidly,"Cautiously ordered, delayed starting but then found myself engrossed. Medical terminology a bit confusing but don't let it hold you back. I agree with the author's sentiments, we need more people in this profession."
3,It Should Have Been Better,"What should have been a very interesting page turner turned out to be a little tedious, slightly repetitive and a little vain. We had to be reminded sevewral times that Dr. Maples and his peers would never have become sick with the sites and smells of a forensic laboratory. Although I managed to learn a few valuable things from ""Dead Men,"" it wasn't written very well. This book fell short of my anticipations."
3,not as good as hoped,"This book follows a trend of many forensic anthropology books in that the author seems to spend more time on quoting literature and history then on cases. When Dr. Maples does get around to telling of a case, the details are few. If readers are interested in very good books of this subject they sould try Ubelaker's ""Bones"" and ""A Fly for the Prosecution"", I've forgotten the author to this one. Both of which deal with cases much more throughly than any I've read. This book by Dr. Maples is good for beginners. If you've read a few forensic anthropolgy books and are more advanced, you may find this selection boring and limited in useful information. Also, stay away from ""The Bone Lady""."
4,These intelligent and gripping tales are most amazing!,"Strange and Fascinating....this book definately lives up to its lengthy title. I was completely astonished by the intelligent writing and gruesome tales told in this collection of cases. You will laugh, cry, and more often than not grit your teeth at the witty tales that dead men tell in this book by William R. Maples and Michael Browning. This is a truly cunning book for people with the slightest interest in, well, death. Overwhelmingly educational and extremely well-written, ""Dead Men Do Tell Tales"" is extraordinary and brilliant in more ways than one. This is one of the most thought-provoking books you could ever read"
3,Average.,"It was interesting for the first half and became tiresome afterwards. I didnt find it difficult to read at all. And I learned a few things. But the self-promotion is poorly concealed, and I'm not sure why the reader needs to know Maples drives a Cadillac and makes major bucks. Another turn-off is his whining about others who are involved in his investigations. I have to cope with morons every day. It's part of the job. To correct and work around their blunders. But the book is a fair primer of the vocation."
5,So much precious informations for writing good designed SC,"Server control in ASP.Net is not so much documented. Each ""professional"" book have only 1 or 2 chapter on client control and server control. Client server are easy to create but are not versatile like server control. In this book, the author's take time to explain every aspect to create rich and smooth server control with OOP in mind. They explain Event and Delegate like real teacher. Not like professional programmer!!Style, validation, client script and much much more are explain in detail.But this book is not for beginner programmer. Intermediate programmer with some basic in ASP.Net and C#,Java, VB.Net or C++ will, with no problem be able to understand and appreciate this book.Good reading. Take in mind that in 2005, we will have to read another ten to twelve books to understand Vs.2005!!!!For no more money in the pocket..."
2,Cliff Notes Don't Always Work,"I admit that I tried to cheat when I bought this album. I wanted to get into Frank, and didn't really know where to start. I wasn't interested, however, in retracing his career to purchase his efforts chronologially in an attempt to obtain a complete section. I just wanted to have a few songs so I could pop them in and call myself a fan. This was not the disc that got the job done. While most of the songs are great and the artistry is clear, this collection of songs does not work together well. I understand the risk anytime I buy a ""greatest hits."" But this was terribly disappointing. I MAY feel inclined to listen to a song or two, but I am never inclined to put this in for the night. I am sure there are Frank collections that are wonderful, but this is not one of them."
3,It's Ok ...Twist at the end,"This society judges people far to much, if people were not so homophobic movies like this would not have to be be made. I say watch the movie for the message."
2,Save your money,"The acting was horrendous and the story didn't make much sense. Some of the parts had no relation to one another and seemed to be thrown in just to make the movie longer. Also, there were critical mistakes made like the relationship the boxer had with his side piece, mid movie there was an obvious change to the side jawn like the viewer wouldn't notice that it was clearly a different person. The story and the characters were underdeveloped."
2,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"From other reviews I thought it would be a good movie. They don't tell you the movie has sex, language, trashy, slutty. If you are a christian, you want to know these things, so you don't buy this trash and throw away your money.I'm angry that reviewers don't tell the truth about movies and don't say that there is drugs, sex, sex scenes, foul language, some indecent scenes, too much violence. Then we can read their reviews and make a intelligent decision NOT TO BUY.REVIEWERS... tell us the truth in your reviews so we can get a clear picture of whether the moview is decent enough to buy or not. If you are a christian, then tell us...you will not like this movie. It has D, S, L V."
5,Cable Works,"Local store bought cable (generic) was noisy, with horizontal interference lines. This one works perfect and a delivers a fine HD picture."
1,Broke first time trying to plug them in,My cable broke the first time I tried to connect it to my Computer and TV. Not only did the pins bend but the plastic tab inside near the pins broke off.
4,A great little mouse for the price..,"I was a little skeptical when buying this mouse.. I wasnt sure whether or not I would like the colors, or just be really annoyed, but I have to say, its a pretty cool little mouse. The colors are very vibrant (I'm going to post some pictures) but not too bright to where it will distract the user. It is a retractable mouse, and the cord is quite short, so desktop useage will be limited for many people, but its perefect for a laptop if you want something big enough to actually be able to use, but small enough to store easily in a carrying case. The mouse moves pretty fast across the screen without a great deal of movement. Some people like this, some dont. Personally, I like it better than my desktop mouse, which needs a great deal of movement to get it across the screen. Its good for laptop users with limited area to move the mouse. Overall, I would say this is a great mouse to buy, especially for a kid, but adults will enjoy it too."
3,Redesign not as nice as original,"I have a friend who uses an older model of this mouse (which looks like the item pictured on Amazon). I used it when I was using her computer one afternoon and found it to be the perfect size for my hand. It's very comfortable, just sensitive enough and the wheel on it spins easily, unlike the horrid Microsoft mouse I had been using. I ordered one thinking that I was getting what is pictured here. Nope- Targus has redesigned it to have a clear ""cut glass"" appearance on top; like those cheesy plastic platters that you find at the grocery store that are supposed to kinda sorta replicate the look of waterford crystal. The end effect is not a soft, pleasing color change like the original, but a harsh, painful blinding distraction. The laser can be seen through the clear plastic. Not good! It's so comfortable and easy to use that I don't want to give it up, so I guess I'll need to put some tape over it. Way to ruin a once cool design Targus!"
1,Why waste power?,"This mouse is just right except the silly changing light. Of what possible use is it? Why can't I turn it off? Surely the extra lighting and its timer suck power out of my netbook and reduce battery life. I didn't read the packaging before buying and opening it, never dreaming that a notebook/netbook mouse would be purposely designed to increase power consumption for no reason. Now I'm stuck with it. What a waste."
2,Maybe okay for laptop; awful for desktop,"The cord is 2.5 feet long. That sounds like a lot, but it is too short to be useful for a desktop. It's hard to find good corded mice these days, and I'm sorry to say, this one didn't fit the bill for me."
2,Nice until it died,"I got this mouse about about a year ago to go with my laptop. I enjoyed the retractable cord and the fact that that it is small, which makes it easy to carry around. I also have small hands so it fits nicely. Plus it lit up, which was just fun.When I was looking for a mouse this was just what I was looking for. It did not need to have a lot of fancy buttons, all it had to do was be a mouse. However it died yesterday. There was not much logic behind it, it just stopped functioning. I have tried to get it work again and have decided that is a fruitless task. I don't know what the average life span of a mouse is but I have had other mice for much longer periods of time.Basically, if you are looking for a fairly decent, inexpensive mouse that may not last you a long time, than this would be a good mouse for you."
3,"it is fancy, but won't last long (1 year)","It was cool to use when I first got it, but it went dead completely in less than one year. My friend also had this problem. I won't buy stuff from Targus anymore."
2,"After the coolness wears off, it's a big disappointment","The mouse wheel feels nice. The whole thing is a good size. I play with the retractable cable often and it is just fine after a year.However, it makes the cursor move on its own. And scroll too. And the cursor jumps too. Not constantly, but just enough to drive someone insane.It also can't handle small movements. It seems like it doesn't always register it. I am not using it for Counterstrike or any kind of image editing. Just day to day movements and it just gets stuck sometimes."
5,Love this mouse,"I got this just for fun but I love the smaller mouse and the changing colors are pretty cool. While that is a fun feature, the mouse works well and once you use a smaller mouse, a regular sized one feels like it is the size of a softball. Very affordable and ecnomical."
5,Small and entertaining,"This is a great laptop mouse. I find that the small size makes it easy to carry and easy to use. The color sequence feature is a total crowd pleaser. And, it's cheap! Buy 2!"
5,Groupin with Biohazard,"An excellent album! Madball's most famous being ""D.M.S"", I personally found this to be too primative! None the less, Madball is back with their new ""Look My Way"" a must for any Madball collection. Included in this is the Spanish version of ""My Family"" from the D.M.S album. This song is titled ""Nasta Familia"" (excuse the spelling).... soundz better then the original. They're sounding more & more like Biohazard every time I hear them. GET THIS ONE!!!"
1,Inaccurate,I bought a few of these. They all read a few degrees different. Avoid this brand if you need accuracy.
1,Doesn't fit 99 new beetle.,This item does NOT fit a 1999 Beetle with spoiler. The shipping was expensive. I waited to install until outside the return window. I am now stuck with a hatch strut that does not fit. I don't know what it fits and it cost twice as much as buying it from someone who knows what fit what. I'm not very happy.Hope you have better luck.
3,Solid Job by Author,"This book details the business career of Milken, the rise to the top and then the fall to prison. The book has a fair amount of rather interesting tabloid type information of his business operation, his life style and his take home pay - so much money it is almost sickening. The author also takes us through how he got caught, what the charges were, the trail and the prison time. We also get some information on Milken after jail. Overall you can tell the bias of the author in that he obviously views Milken in high regard and has not one nice thing to say about the government attorneys. The book is well written and interesting, if not bias. There is some new information here and if you are interested in the period or the man then this is a book you should read."
5,I love this movie. it's so cool,"Jigsaw is one of the coolest psychological thrillers ever. Most people will call it a horror movie, but it's more than that. It's not just a monster hacking away at horny teenagers. You get to know the characters very well and you actually care for most of them. I was at the world premeier and met all the actors. it was fun. I highly recomend you guys buy this movie. it rocks! Even though the horror and scary stuff dosn't happen until the last 35 minutes, it's still really good. The first half is also interesting. It explains the characters backrounds and such before they are set to slaughter, it's actually kind of intersting. My favorite character was Tawny, she was the cutest and the best. I hope she becomes famous one day."
1,horrendous,"who cares if the actors are ""fun""! the movie was absolutely horrible. and of course what do you come to expect from full moon pictures though? really not much! almost the whole movie takes place around a bar, eww how exciting, no its really not exciting. even though the concept seemed like it was going to be interesting the dialogue and story was poorly written so not much here except disappointment. very boring flick. wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy."
4,learning about our past puts life into perspective,"from Praying, no.81, p. 31: ""Peter Gilmour has written an important book. As we near the end of the twentieth century we look around us, and everywhere we see shattered institutions, families, communities and individual souls. Only contact with the sacred and holy can motivate us to go out into our neighborhoods, our society and our world and begin the necessary repairs and healing. When we find the holy breath and spirit of God in our own daily life and living then there is real hope for dynamism and transcendence."""
5,Very useful,"I've only had this book for a short time and I've already made two things from it and plan on making at least two more before Christmas. It will also come in handy for year-round gift giving. I learned how to do the three needle bind off from the book which I'll always use now. I purchased this book mostly because one of my favorite bloggers has it, but it has turned out to be the best book in my knitting library."
2,A little disappointed,"I should have checked this book out of the library before I bought it. There are some nice patterns, but for me they're not worth the price of the book. I don't need a pattern to make a simple triangle kerchief, basic scarves and blankets, 1x1 rib legwarmers, etc. etc. So many of these really aren't patterns, in my opinion. I could come up with these things on my own with a little imagination and my stitch dictionaries (or in many cases, even without my stitch dictionaries). However, I do like several of the patterns, including the angora booties, silk camisole, and stuffed toys, among others. It's a nicely designed book with lovely pictures, but most of the ""patterns"" left me uninspired. I am, however, pleased that the author's suggested yarns are all natural fibers. Good quality natural fiber yarn goes such a long way to making simple handknits into something special."
3,Enjoyable to browse through,"This book has lovely photography and is a pleasure to look through. Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect to find a book full of knitted gifts that one could make in a short time that aren't for babies.In any event, there are 33 patterns in the book, 27 of which fall into the ""8 hours or less category."" Of the 27 that are 8 hours or less, 25 are knitted. Of these 25, 7 (or 8 depending on interpretation) are for babies are children.Of the adult patterns, the short ones include things like a kerchief, Christmas ornaments, potholders, a tea cozy and legwarmers. I found these patterns less that inspiring or less than practical.However, there are also some patterns I found beautiful, such as the adult hat patterns, the scarf patterns, and some of the ""more than 8 hour"" patterns.Basically, it's a lovely book, with many patterns worth knitting, especially if you have a child or baby to knit for. The best adult knits will take a little longer."
4,"Generally a good, quick gift knitting book","I love the overall layout of this book. The author outlines color and knitting basics, then organizes patterns according to approximately how long they will talk. The author tried to have a nice variety of patterns, which I think was somewhat achieved. I don't know how great of gifts some of the things would make though, such as legwarmers, but to each their own. I feel like this book was directed more towards baby and children gifts, but those are also generally quick and easy to make. There is also a nice variety of adult/all age gifts such as scarves and sweaters."
1,too many mistakes,"I'm an experienced knitter, but the rabbit is definitely not a last minute project. There are some errors in the pattern, starting with the yardage in a skein of the suggested yarn, and none of them are listed in the errata. I intended to make the elephant,too, since I have twin grandchildren. The girl will get the rabbit when I finally finish it, but I'll buy the boy a truck. The book looks good, but I question the value of the contents."
3,disappointing patterns,"If you're looking for easy, this book will fit the bill, but I really felt stupid for buying it. Some of these patterns are so simple I could have just made the patterns up myself by looking at the picture. (e.g. the picture on the front cover -- a bag all stockinette knit, seriously?)"
4,Fun patterns and a beautiful book to enjoy,"I bought this before Christmas thinking I would make some quick items to give as gifts but this book's value extends way beyond ""holiday-cramming"" projects. It is a joy to read with lovely illustrations and paper. I just finished the early American baby bonnet. The pattern was correct and easy to follow and the project was unique and gratifying. I highly recommend this book."
2,"Exactly as the title states, but what fun is it to knit in a rush?","This book is very boring and I'm going to give it to someone ELSE as a last minute gift. The patterns are exactly as stated, very simple with barely any shaping or creativity at all. Probably good for beginning knitters, but it has no instruction section, only a 6 page special technique section. It has beautiful photos, but that doesn't make up for the lame patterns. Felted potholders? Please... I'd have more fun shopping for a gift than knitting one of those up. Plus, I don't believe the time frames given for the projects, i.e. 4-6 hours for the gusseted floor cushions. No way."
2,Bummed,I was hoping for alittle more substance. Please authors no more scarfs! Weekend Knitting by Melanie Falick has more bang for the money
1,Beware,"Knitters should beware that the first edition of this book contains many errors in many patterns. The corrections are on the Purl Soho website and I believe they are on the 4th edition of this book to correct the many, many errors. Also beware that the 2nd and 3rd editions, although they have some corrections do not contain all of them.Although many of the patterns are beautiful, they should have been tested/edited more closely. I spent a lot of money on this book and expect the patterns to correct. It's not unusual to have 1 or 2 errors in a book of this size but this one seems to contain an inordinate amount."
3,Cute ideas but mistakes galore!,"This book has some cute ideas for gifts but the patterns are full of mistakes!!! It's frustrating that they didn't ""proof"" the patterns before they went to the printer.Good news: purlsoho.com has the errata"
5,Inspirational and fun,"I LOVE this book. I am a beginning knitter (still...after 2 years) but I've made a number of beautiful, challenging projects from this book. It is my favorite resource...and I own just about every knitting book. The only fault: some of the yarns they use in their examples are pricey and rare....oh but I do love them."
5,Great Concepts,"This book is full of beautiful quick gifts. What I like the most about this book is how it is sorted (by the length of time it takes an average knitter to finish a project). I've found the patterns to be reasonable and easy to understand. I have yet to really get ""into"" the book and test out a bunch of patterns. But, from reading them it appears as if they are written well.The only real downer with this book is the lack of ""alternate"" patterns. I like a book to have patterns that are not just clothes or bags. This book is missing that, but still worth getting. I've actually given this book as a gift and it worked well for that too."
3,misleading title,"I'm not unhappy that I purchased this book. It's hardback and has great pictures. What it doesn't have is ""last-minute"" knitted gift ideas.I'd be more inclined to take a month or more on some of these projects. However, I understand that not everyone is at the same knitting skill level....so maybe I'm just not skilled enough yet. I'd love to read about someone who had a great experience with these knitting ideas.Either way, like I wrote, I'm not unhappy I purchased this book. Maybe someday, through lots of practice, I could manage a few of these challenges."
4,Great pattern book.,"One of the neatest thing about this book is how quick and easy the projects are. When you're down to hours before a baby shower, a birthday party or a holiday - this is the book I would turn to find that unique gift for someone special.I have several books by this author, and all of them have some of the most beautiful photos. Joelle's instructions are easy to follow, the patterns are fun, pretty and who wouldn't love a cashmere tea cozy! I love just flipping through and admiring the gorgeous projects and dreaming of what I could make."
5,"Great picture, easy to read instructions","I love this knitting book. The instructions are so easy to read, any tricky part is well defined and illustrated. I love that they give ""time"" references on the projects...yet i am a slow knitter so also double the time alotted."
4,Great book for knitters!,"This book is very detailed and explains all you need to do. This book is not for the BRAND NEW knitter, have some simple knitting projects under your belt. The pictures are beautiful and helpful to know what the end result should be. I loved it and will use it continually!"
3,Babies don't notice late gifts!,"There are a lot of patterns for things I already have patterns for, but that's my fault. I guess I'm to the individual pattern stage, or at least need to buy in bookstores where I can examine the whole book.But babies don't notice late gifts! I know some babies, they don't mind. It's my adult friends I wanted time-rated options for. There were an awful lot of baby gifts in there. Baby things are by nature fast to knit- they're small.My adult friends don't want baby booties. They won't fit."
5,Great book for knitters!,"What a great way to use up those left over skeins of yarn! This book is filled with thoughtful, delightful gifts that can be knitted in a few hours."
2,"Nice photographs, mediocre patterns","Okay, so does a tassel or pom-pom count as a gift? Probably not, unless the recipient is a cat.The nice thing about this book is that it's organized according to how many hours it would take to knit various gifts."
2,uninspiring,"I frequently watch out for any new knitting books so I can find any new idea. This book is disappointing because the projects are just plain. I don't like the author spent pages just to describe (worship) a simple scarf, and pages devoted for pom pom? This is a trend anyway that beautiful cover with a few simple projects can sell to some novices. I just go back to some classic knitting books I enjoyed for years."
3,Nice book but not what's promised,"The title of this book should be renamed ""Better Not Be the Last Minute Knitted Gifts"" because the projects take Way longer to knit than the suggested time. And I am not a slow knitter, either. Some of the projects are near impossiable, too, like Airy Scarf done in laceweight yarn- Oy! If you want to torture yourself than make this project. That said there are some very inspiring and good ideas in here, but I am not sure how practical this book is."
2,Not as good!,"This is a very expensive book with very few projects and very similar to any other knitting book. For your money, better buy ""Weekend Knitting"" it has 50 unique projects for everyone in your list and all of the patterns are very original."
1,Failure,"In Polanski's film Oliver Twist, he fails to bring out the real message and story of this young orphan. People who just see this movie and do not read the book will see the wrong message of Oliver Twist. They will see an adventure instead of an explanation of the workhouses. That was Dickens' reason for making Oliver Twist. I thought this movie was horrible. I knew Polanski would have to cut out some characters and scenes from the book, but he cut out all the important ones. The story did not show Twist's family history and characters. I also believe this movie gave a bad message to kids because it showed people how to pickpocket. Also, in the book there was plenty of humor but in the movie I did not laugh at all except when I first saw Fagin. The one bright spot of the film was Ben Kingsley's role as Fagin who acted with a sweet and old voice yet you knew by his sound that he was a thief. BUY THE BOOK AND DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE."
2,"Surprisingly--all atmosphere, no delivery","It begins and ends with little Barney Clark. If your Oliver can't act, then by-golly, there's nothing to look at for the next two hours besides the nice sets and the costuming.Honestly, I do have to admit to three good performances in the movie: Ben Kingsley was excellent as Fagin, Jamie Foreman was effective as Sykes, and Harry Eden as the Artful Dodger gave a great performance.But when the titular role is not compelling, or even interesting, then those other parts can not captivate nor horrify you the way they were written to be. If your audience doesn't care about Oliver, then there's a big, big problem with having an entire movie that revolves around him. It gets boring real fast.So sorry, Mr. Polanski!"
3,A great visual movie but that about it,A great visual movie from start to finish but other then that the movie is just good but not great. The story is about oliver twist and I think alomost everyone knows it. The story is good but at times drags on and will leave the viewer board. The acting is good but not great for a time piece movie. The direction is good. The movie fails becouse people do not really want to see a kovie like this and only certain people will like it. The film is great for being so visual and the costuems are great and the score. The movie is a good time peice movie but sadely will be forgoten fast.
4,OLIVER!,"It is certainly the definitive version of Dicken's classic story. Polanski's canvas of visual depth and human population is striking. The hellish orphanage looks like the hull of an unfortunate slave ship, and the City of London is a paradox of dangerous alleyways and sky kissing church steeples. If there is a weak link, it is the young actor who plays Oliver, who seems merely a director's product, although it may be Polanski's intent to use a novice in presenting the innocence of a child. The rest of the cast is remarkably indebted to their characters."
1,Why does Hollywood think they can improve the classics?,"I found this version to be very dark and depressing. Not at all entertaining. I've read the book as a kid and have seen all versions including the musical which was the best. This version is something i would not take children to see and yet Oliver is about a child. Has Hollywood gotten so distorted in their thinking with loose morals or is that Hollywood is no longer the creative capital of the world. Films that are made in other countries run circles around american films. Of course we no longer have the real talent that we had many years ago. Don't bother to view this film, get the original or get the musical. Don't even bother to rent this one unless you want your kids to have nightmares."
2,ZZZZZZ....,"This is going to be short...I found this movie to be very boring...I lost interest in this film right out of the shoot. I do not think that this is a film that children should see...it is very dark, and it would not keep the attention of any child that I know of....skip this film, read the book!!"
2,Just as I had expected,"In reading the published reviews wirtten for this movie thus far, I am not surprised that even with some contrasting opinions, they all seem to share the same common ground. No, I have not seen the production, but I anticipated that it would be yet another Hollywood, ""Letdown, Wetdown, and Putdown!""Here we are once again, running to the ""title"" of the movie rather than the quality of the film itself. I find these reviews to be extremely helpful; similar to the warnings on a prescription label. Having read them all, I am safely avoiding this movie just the way I did with another ""bomb"" - The Chocolate Factory.It becomes more obvious to me that Hollywood is only interested in increasing its wealth, while attacking American ethos; hence, lowering its standards even more."
2,I wished I had watched this one earlier...,"This review is not so much a rating for the movie, but the quality of the disc. I bought the DVD about 6 months ago and never had time to watch it. Until a few days ago. After 1h 41m the movie got stuck! Took it out of the player, carefully examined the DVD surface... not the slightest scratch or dust particle to be seen. Put it back in, jump to the scene and... stuck again. I have another player... guess what, it gets stuck already at the annoying SONY Pictures opening logo. Tried the disc in two different PCs, same problem: SONY Pictures logo and then... nothing. Ultimately tried to make a copy using DVDFab, a wonderful program that usually helps out, but nope: error reading disc. Of course it is too late now to send it back. I did like the movie though, so I'll spend another 10 bucks for a new copy. Hopefully I can then return here to add some more stars."
3,Great movie!,The only reason I gave this movie a three is because I have not had a chance yet to use it in my classroom. I am planning on using it to introduce a British Lit unit. I still plan to do this...just haven't had the time. The movie itself is great.
5,Wonderful Adaption!,"As a Dickens maniac and something of an Oliver Twist buff, I was a bit dubious about yet another screen adaption.As it happens, I was absolutely delighted by this movie! Although necessarily condensed, it truly captures the emotional power of the story in a captivating and haunting way. The acting and casting were truly superb- many of the characters are portrayed as vividly as I could ever picture them while reading the book. A definite salute to Ben Kingsley as a fascinatingly creepy-crawly Fagin and Barney Clark as a very sypathetic and innocent yet resilient Oliver. I also loved seeing Edward Hardwicke in a role other than Watson to Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes.Gritty, heart-wrenching and really exquisite, this adaption verily immerses you in the wonderful story of Oliver Twist in a manner that stands out from all of the other adaptions I have seen. Fantastic job, I think Dickens would approve very much.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go read the book all over again! :)"
3,Oliver Twisted,"While the story remains the same, Polanski has missed a few important elements, leaving me to wonder if he read the book before directing the movie.Granted that in any rendition of such a work the director must cut out a lot of the novel to compress it to fil the space of time he has, but I found it unforgiveable cutting the missing links to Oliver's past--the locket, the portrait, etc.Redeeming the film of course was the performance of Ben Kinsgley as Fagin--truly impressive acting; still it is yet another rendition of the classic tale and Polanski adds no novelty nor elightenment as he has in other classic tales (I will never forget the ending of Polanski's Macbeth, for example!)it's still the heartwarming tale, but I'm afraid nothing more than that."
5,Marshalls on 10,"First time I heard of this group was around 82 while in California employed by Uncle Sam. Catchy tunes with a sense of humor. Devil's Deck was the first tune I had ever heard by them which was receiving radio play back then. Steve Shelski's soloes have a hint of Kim Mitchell influence but I also hear a bit of Randy Rhoads vibe on Love Poison. Over the years I have turned a few friends onto this band. No hair or speed metal here dudes, just really good early 80's hard rock.This album is my favorite but the others have some great tunes on them as well."
3,Rejoice,"The sex scenes in this book are pretty good, if you are into that sort of thing. And most of the first half of the book is amusing, especially Emmanuelle's relationships with other women (sexual or not). But the second half of the book is dominated by Italian playboy Mario educating Emmanuelle about his philosophy of eroticism. This is pretty pretentious stuff, and rather dull. Mario almost makes sex seem boring. What a windbag! Also, the book ends rather abruptly. It feels like there was another chapter that got left out. But the book is worth a read, if only because it has become so iconic."
1,This book is unreadable!,"I was interested in the book and the movie because of the 70's feminist/female-empowerment angle. I am sorry to say that I purchased this book after reading the mixed reviews here and found that it was completely unreadable. Perhaps it's because it's translated from the French: I will give it the benefit of the doubt that the writing appears better in its original language. But In English, the writing is terrible and there is no attempt at any literary value (despite its claims). The ""erotica"" was so clumsily worded as to have no appeal at all. I stopped reading after a few chapters. At least the movie had Sylvia Kristel, who - no matter what you think of her acting skills - is kinda cool in her cult, campy, 70's way. But this book has no Sylvia Kristel or any kind of cult cool. If you think Danielle Steele and Shirley Conran is corny and unreadable, this is much, much worse. It was a waste of money."
3,A fun read - especially if you've seen the film(s),"The novel Emmanuelle is a little vapid, but fun to read after seeing the soft-core film that came out in 1975. Actually, that first film spawned 6 additional Emmanuelle films in the next 15 years. Imagine a hot-blooded young French girl, who's barely old to vote, coming to Bangkok to join her new husband, who works in the French embassy. All the players in this little story are quite libidinous. After arriving, Emmanuelle proceeds to meet 3-4 women, all of whom she falls in love with, and her husband wants to see her expand her sexual horizons and sleep with some male companions he introduces her to. And the story goes on. It's a quick read, a good page turner. I enjoyed it. Now I'd like to go back and try to find a couple more titles from the Emmanuelle film collection on DVD."
1,Pretentious Drivel,"A couple of scenes involving Emmanuelle and her catty, women friends are real and amusing. The rest of the novel is preposterous. The eighty pages of ranting by an artist named Mario might inadvertently constitute the most savage indictment of the ""examined life"" in the annals of literature."
1,No Title,"The author may have lived in the tropics and had wild times. She had no connection with the world around her beyond comments about the heat, which may have double meanings. The rant of Man's world over the natural world smacks of the college cafe. The sex in the aircraft is something else to seperate her from the world around her. Basically a few good sex scenes and early 70's pop philosophy.The Movie version provides better entertainment."
4,classic Monty,sick but so funny! Quoteable scenes that are still able to crack me up. Not for the staid or stodgey.
1,Not what I thought...,"Both cartridges were not shipped in original HP packaging as I thought. I tried to use both cartridges and both issues, a piece broke off of one and the other did not work. They have a 90-day return policy which I could find no record of when I ordered and it is not listed on the products page as of now. It has now been 106 days since I placed my order. This was $290 completely wasted. To replace these cartridges, I ordered original HP cartridges and they are working fine with no issues."
2,Have issues with this cartridge,"This s 2nd cartridge I have received in last year that is defective, not sure if HP is cutting corners on their production procedures but I have ordered dozens of these over the years and never had this many issues with HP product."
1,Don't Buy from this Company,"It took 20 days, 10 days after the latest date we were supposed to get it to arrive. Installed the first one, the print was so light could not read it. When we pulled it out of the machine it had leaked all over inside and made a huge mess. Thinking it was probably a fluke we tried the other one, same thing, had to clean the machine again and get a cartridge locally as we couldn't wait any longer which worked well. When contacted Midnight Merchant they could not or would not make a decision or own up to their responsibility."
1,Buyer beware,"This is a very outdated version. I purchased it thinking it was the latest model, but there really is no way to tell from the info provided."
5,This is a great book for pre-schoolers!,"I checked this book out of the library and it is wonderful! I am using it to teach my 3 year olds Spanish. There are colorful pictures by category, for example, animals, with the English and Spanish names for each word. It is too bad that this book is out of print!"
5,Excelente!,"Definitivamente una joya bibliográfica sobre todo para aquellos que somos originarios de Nogales, ya sea Arizona o Somora, contiene muchas fotografiad evocadoras y un texto interesante."
2,"Holiday Earworms, made even more annoying.","If my three year old were reviewing this, her review would go like this:""Put on the Dora CD please!""But my three year old is not reviewing this, I am. This CD has some of the catchiest, most likely to get stuck in your head holiday songs performed by some of the most annoying characters on television. There is not a single un-synthesized instrumental on the CD.If you like/can tolerate Dora and company plus holiday songs, it's not awful. If either one of those things is likely to make you insane, this CD makes the trip to crazy-town that much shorter."
5,NOW I KNOW,"Wow , what a great book....I saw a 'Modern Marvel' episode on the History Channel either about the Eiffel Tower or in a group with other structures , whatever , I then bought some posters of the tower and put them up in my living room and then searched for a book on the tower and saw this and got it....very good book , very informative and a good deal more than just the tower...It tells the story of the French society at the time of the construction and the pitfalls and highs of building it...the Eiffel Tower was the tallest structure built by man since the pyramids in Eygpt...did not know that...NOW I KNOW...."
4,Good Reading for the Casual History Reader,I love history books that are written for the casual reader yet thorough and interesting. This book was a pleasure to read and covering a very interesting and amazing feat.
3,great bio,The book was a great biography and I wished there was more of the copy that this man done. I did love the attention to detail and this was a well researched piece of work. I was surprised to find that the author was from a town next to mine.
1,misleading advertising,"I eargerly awaited this game,and when it came,put it into the drive ready to go. except it wouldnt work in my Mac! there were some very minute illegible instructions on the disk about a mac-but I couldnt read them-even with new glasses.Needless to say,I was very dissapointed. and to be charged $4.95 for delivery that cost them under a dollar is a gyp!!"
5,AFTER DARK GAMES,"SO MUCH FUN, MY 77 AND 79 YEAR OLD PARENTS GOT ME HOOKED ON THIS SEVERAL YEARS AGO. I FINALLY FOUND IT AT AMAZON. CANT GET ENOUGH OF ROOF RATS"
4,Great Fun,This gift was for a friends birthday. She is thoroughly enjoying the game. Although the game is probably aimed at players aged 7-10 she is well over those ages and she loves it.I received the game in great condition and very quickly. I will order from this seller again. Thanks again.
3,AFTER DARK GAMES,THIS IS A VERY NICE SET OF GAMES. MY 16 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LIKES TO PLAY THE VARIETIES OF GAMES. SOME OF THE GAMES ARE FROM WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND HE EVEN LOVES TO PLAY THOSE GAMES. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS COLLECTION OF GAMES TO OTHER PEOPLE AND CHILDREN. IT IS FUN FOR ALL AGES.
5,Fun Games,"I had these games on my old computer and couldn't wait to get one for my new computer. Most of the games are just for fun, but a couple make you think also. I enjoy playing these games every day."
5,Fanatastic computer game!,"Have had this game for probably 15 years! Easy, relaxing, good choices for all ages, and price sure is right! I play some of these games every day. I bought this product recently to give to friend as a gift."
5,Fun even after all these years!,"This may be an old set of games, but it's still great fun if you don't want to get too involved. A great quicky time killer."
4,SIMPLE SLOW GAME FOR YOUR COMPUTER,"THIS GAME IS PROBABLY 20 YEARS OLD. SLOW, ONE CLICK AT A TIME SO FOR THOSE OF US WHO WANT SOMETHING SIMPLE AND EASY, THIS ONE IS PERFECT -SMILE-..DOWNLOAD JUST TOOK A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN IT IS IN MY STARTUP MENU SO I CAN OPEN IT WITH ONE CLICK AND START PLAYING IN SECONDS. MOOSHO IS A MATCHING TILES GAME THAT I LIKE THE BEST..EVEN THOUGH I RARELY WIN -SMILE-"
5,favorite game ever,"This is a collection of some very fun games. Most are puzzle games and all are quick to play. I have this on my office machine and think it's a fun (and quick) break from my day to day stresses.I wish somebody would release an updated version of this!! So fun!If you like the humor of the old After Dark screensavers (like flying toasters) and games like Scrabble or Boggle, you'll love these games."
4,After Dark Games Review,Several quick and fun games. Not overly complex. My grandson and I enjoy playing the games together.
1,Not what we hoped it would be,"We were looking for a low-cost greenhouse that could help extend the life of our plants and allow for a longer growing season. It really turned into a growing disaster, and it's ugly to boot.All of our young seedlings were doing great when we put them in there around late March. They were healthy and 5 inches tall, or so. We had carefully nurtured them indoors for many weeks.Within a week, they had fried in the greenhouse. It was just too difficult to keep the air flow optimal on hot days. I'm also not convinced it was warm enough during cold nights.We did transplant one seedling into a big pot and it did much better in the greenhouse, eventually moving outdoors and even growing fruit on it.Given it's ugliness, though, and the fact that the plants were mostly killed, I would definitely not recommend it. Use an indoor window instead, and start your seeds a bit later.D. San"
1,Very disaporinted,"I ordered this greenhouse for my niece for Christmas. It did not get delivered for Christmas. In fact, It NEVER got delivered. I recieved a notice that my return had been recieved and I would be getting a credit.I DID NOT RETURN IT...IT WAS NEVER DELIVERED.When I contacted Bargain Outfitters I was informed it was returned as damaged by UPS.Only the purchase price was credited. I feel my shipping cost should also be refunded, since it was not delivered to my home at all!I am very disapointed, since I can not find another one anywhere else."
3,Misses the mark - could have been so much better,"I found this VeggieTales video the most disappointing. It doesn't contain the trademark items VeggieTales fans have come to expect. The story lacked creativity. The re-telling of the Christmas story lacks the originality it could have been given. All in all, I just wasn't as pleased with this VeggieTale product.It does send a good message, about the over-commercialization of Christmas, but the way it does so lacks the usual VeggieTales originality and fun."
1,Eh!,It was ok. But It was a little hard to clearly see the message while it concentrated more on other distracting parts of the story. Personaly I think it moved to fast and my son didn't seem to care much for it either.
3,Missing the Silly Song,"My sons and I love those vegetables! In this adventure, we learn the true meaning of Christmas and that making other people happy can be a wonderful thing. The humor is good, as always, but we were definitely missing Larry's silly song! Not one of the best but definitely something to keep you entertained."
1,TERRIBLE!,My fundamentalist christian mother bought this at her church bookstore last year for my daughter - the chain saw toy scared her and the vegetables are stupid looking. We didn't get past the chainsaw toy we tried a couple of times. I would never buy a veggie tales video for any child christian or otherwise. If you have to buy a christian video for your child try one by the donut man he knows something about the teachings of jesus the veggie tales do not. It is a shame that I had to give this video a star.
5,How a toy shows Dinkletown the true meaning of Christmas,This was our first VeggieTale video and when I heard it was a Christian video I thought it would be too preachy for kids. However I loved it and my three kids watch it all year long. It is a tale of how Buzzsaw Louie (with a working buzzsaw in his left hand) teaches the people of Dinkle town that the true meaning of Christmas is not more toys. Mr Nezzer is great as a greedy toy maker Silly Songs with Larry is the best one I've seen yet. This video inspired us to get more Veggie Tales
5,Great Christmas show for the kids!,"I bought this (on video) for my kids 3 years ago, and it remains a family favorite. It's a sweet story with a timely Christmas message that's not too preachy or heavy for little kids. My kids enjoy all the VeggieTales stories - the light-hearted, positive themes are great for reinforcing the values I want them to learn, and the silliness is the icing on the cake. I recommend this highly, though you may have to hide it after Christmas, or they'll watch it all year!"
5,My One Year Olds Love It,"We have about ten of the Veggie Tales videos, and my three one-year-olds seem to love this one second best (after Rack, Shack and Benny). The song ""I Can't Believe It's Christmas"" is a soon-to-be classic and the video has a great chase scene at the end.Addendum: Almost three years have gone by since I wrote this review. Our daughter is now four, and she still likes this video. Our twin boys are three. One twin likes it a very great deal. For the other, it is the Mona Lisa & the Hamlet of videos. If he has a bad day or is feeling under the weather, this video never fails to perk him up. HE LOVES IT. At this point ""The Toy that Saved Christmas"" is very easily my kids' #1 favorite Veggie Tales video of all time, and for the one son, his favorite video ever. Our family owns perhaps 200 kids' videos. If we had to go to a deserted island with just one, this would be it."
4,Enjoyable Christmas Movie,"I enjoyed this seasonal Veggietale video a great deal. It wasn't quite what I expected and didn't have all the cool elements of a normal Veggietale, but overall very worthwhile. The penguins are awesome!"
3,Book of the Damned,"This book is not nearly as satisfying as it's prequel ""Fragments."" The concept is interesting but it is fleshed out with cliches'. What could have been a fantastically unique story ended up close to a cheesy screenplay for one of John Carpenter's not-so-good movies. It was nice to see the old friends from ""Fragments"" return, but ultimately, what they got to do in this book wasn't very interesting."
2,Mediocre book,"I didn't read the apparent prequel to this book, but I don't think that should be a requirement.The book is a disjointed jumble of one-dimensional characters and ""action"" (repeated over and over) -- one improbable conspiracy theory piled on top of another."
2,More than just a bit lost at sea ...,"Being a bit of a closet afficianado (sp?) on the Philadelpha Experiment, I picked up SHIP OF THE DAMNED with high hopes ... and perhaps that was my undoing. Had I left my expectations at the door, I might've enjoyed the read a bit more than the 2-star rating, but, unfortunately, the author composes very short, almost terse chapters that do little to stimulate the imagination; rather, he just pushes the plot along. As his prose and storytelling style has been placed on par with Tom Clancy by some reviewer, I think it's a dramatic overstatement. Mr. David attacks his story with an almost ""look, ma, I can write"" mentality, giving very little depth to his characters or the events they fantastically find themselves caught up in. It's high on plot and low on facts and science, so leave the brain at the door if you want to enjoy this ride on the SHIP OF THE DAMNED."
4,Works for at least 8 hours for me,"I don't think it works the whole 12 hours. Still it's a nice product that delivers what it advertises. Much better than Therabreath, Listerine, Scopre, gums of all kinds, and other expensive stuff. I wish there was an easy way to combine both bottles, though. Perhaps a 2 chamber design for the bottle in the future???"
5,Best Mints in the World,"These are hands down the best mints in the world. They're all natural, great tasting, and work great!I don't use these for bad breath, I simply enjoy a good mint. They're sweetened with Xylitol so it is an excellent product compared to most others."
3,Smart Mouth mints,"I've used the mouthwash for a couple of years and think it's the best on the market for taste and longevity. Unfortunately, the mints are just average. Same wonderful taste as the mouthwash, but doesn't pack the same punch and staying power."
3,"Cartoonish, Yet Oddly Compelling","I wanted to like this book a lot less than I did. After all, it's got just about everything in it that bothers me about bad writing: gratuitous action (see INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DUMB for the ultimate gratuitous action cultural artifact), whirled views (New Age-ism on the half-shell: the Seven Churches of Revelation turn out to be--surprise!!--holy sites of the world's major religions), bad theology (Catholics spouting tired works-righteousness views), a dodgy premise combined with shaky metaphysics (a clone from DNA from Jesus' blood equals Superman), etc. But somehow the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I know it's probably a really stupid book, but I generally liked it anyhow. Maybe Monteleone is the Clive Cussler of theological thrillers. One could do worse."
2,A Secret Vatican Conspiracy.,"The Pope is dead! The replacement chosen unanimously by the Vatican was the illegitimate son of a nun who was raised in a Brooklyn orphanage. He became a parish priest who could perform miracles. Is he a savior or the anti-Christ? Everyone, even his mother, knows that things are not working according to scripture.Monteleone used John's Revelation as most of his substantiation that the search for seven signs and Pope Peter II's impending marriage are against the Catholic beliefs. It is predicted that he will be the ""last pope"" because he is from America, what they call the New World.He is certainly the unusual Vatican occupant in every way and just may turn the Mother Church upside down. Peter Carenza was defintely the wrong choice to replace the Polish pope. Lord, help us!"
1,Earlier stuff fresher less poppy,"I bought Dig your own hole a while ago and then Exit Planet Dust. Both are good; but if you listen to them you discover a formula for the Chemicals: tracks 1-3 punchy, bassy, dancy music, tracks 4-6 or 7 more experimental or poppy, tracks 7-9 groovier rock-techno, and then a nice coda with a female vocalist. I really liked the ""waking up, sunday morning"" song on dig your own hole, I hated the noel gallagher song (setting sun) in the middle of the cd. Well, this cd is pretty evenly divided between experimental stuff, which is fine but not too exciting, and things like setting sun. If you liked setting sun, get the cd. Otherwise don't. (Caveat: orange wedge is quite good.)"
1,How nasty.,"Wow. How nauseating. Hey B, Hey G would be ok if you took out the self indulgent lyrics where they refer to themselves as ""super star djs"". Out of control is okay. As in I only threw up my lunch. But the rest are even more so ineffectual and annoying and weak. I was so looking forward to this album as I was the new NIN album, NIn failed worse but the Chems failed pretty badly too. I was sickened to se 1000 copies (literally) of it for sale at my local Best Buy store when it came out, gee I bought one, but I didn't realize when a store has 1000 that must mean it is cheap. Oh my, and it was. Play with a $1500 keyboard at radio shack, you might some of the same effects, they left there old stlye whichi can respect coz change is cool, dont get stagnant, but they left it for somehting really, really bad.Bye Bros, Ill miss ya. I can only hope they don't make yet another embarrassing album that borders on self parody."
2,I'm sorry...,"Now, call me dumb if you like, but this release just does not drill it'sway into my consciousness. Maybe it'll kick out some trance jams in a discoteque, but it definetly is one of the worst albums I've ever heard considering homeplay. The only piece of melody that glued into my brain was the chorus of ""Let Forever Be"", which - surprise surprise! - was originally written by The Beatles! Ok, sure, there is something cachy about the simple yadding of 2Hey Boy, Hey Girl"", but it just ain't good enough! The rest of the album made me feel like I was listening to a repeated lines form the icecreamtruck's music..."
3,An Attempt to Redo The Magic of Dig Your Own Hole,"This album is good in that it tries to expand the big beat magic that made Dig Your Own Hole such a popular mainstream dance/electronica album, but it doesn't do it so well. The overall machine-like 1980s computer sounds on tracks like ""Music: Response"" and ""Hey Boys, Hey Girls"" decreases the worth of many of the tracks. There are some decent gems to be found here (""Out of Control"" happens to be a personal favorite), but Come With Us is a better example of the Chems expanding that magic that is big beats."
3,not their best...,"i know everybody is telling me that this album is da bomb, and that is is supposed to not have those block-rockin beats that made ""Dig Your Own Hole"" a masterpiece. But, I can't get over it! I need my block rockin beats! this album falls short in a couple manners. It won't fuel your fire but it may dose you off to a strange dimension, and if that's what you want, go ahead and buy it."
5,Surrender to This and Pray For It,"I personally loved this CD. Easily this is one of my favorite CD's. It had great taste with upbeat movement that never ends. This is a CD that won't bore you. My favorite songs on this CD is Sunshine Undergroud, and Hey Boy Hey Girl, Sunshine Undergroud being my personal favorite. Overall anyone who loves Fatboy Slim, Crystal Method, DJ Shadow, ect. will love this just as I did...."
5,Chem Bros pull out another winner,"From the very first song, starting with the huge bass rumble, moving into the high twangy beats, I was hooked on the CD. If you've got a system worth listening to in your car, this CD is gonna get a lot of play! Its still decent if you don't, but you won't get the full effect! FYI, they got a concert at the aragon ballroom (chicago) on the 19th of July with FBS!"
3,A mixed bag,"Surrender is an album which could have been so much better. It hints at being a great album with songs such as hey boy, hey girl, but it is let down by some songs which seem unfinished, and some which are just awful. HOWEVER, it is still worth listening to, and is a defenite buy for their fans"
5,It Keeps Getting Better,"Under the Influence is one of the best songs in Chemical Brothers history--no wait, in the history of techno/big beat. Most of the other songs are great as well, Orange Wedge and Out of Control in particular. Don't listen to anyone who tells you Surrender is not as good as Dig Your Own Hole. They keep improving as they go along, as all groups should."
5,Chem Bros keep doing it...,"Awsome disc, another great from the Chemical Brothers. Different from previous recordings, less drum & bass, more synthesized material. Nice vocals by Hope Sandoval (Mazzy Star) too. A must by for Chemical Brothers fans and new listeners as well..."
3,Nice Beginning,"When I first listened to this album, I wasn't that crazy about it. But after a few listens it really started to grow on me. The first 3 songs are absolutely incredible. Music-Response has these infectious, high-pitched synth sounds that build and meld into robotic rhythm. It's a great song, really unusual, spacey and disonant at times. The Chems merge then into Under the Influence which is great and bassy and estatic. Then the album culminates with Out of Control-- which is so sexy and danceable. The lyrics caress and then you hear this New Order guitar riff the builds orgasmically. Great stuff. Then the rest of the album is downhill from there. It's a bit more ambient and I find it a little boring. Not unlistenable, just slow and without the energy or inspiration of the beginning. Hey, Boy, Hey Girl is ok-- is just sounds like typical techno club music, nothing special."
3,Chemical Smiles All Round!,"If you are like me and enjoy dance music but cannot dance, then Surrender is for you. The Brothers seem to have brought together a delicious combination of trancey, poppy and singable dance tunes blended with the best in guest vocalling. It is an album that inspires a certain edge of pulse-racing rhythm in all of us, and certain tracks that will stick like glue include ""Let Forever Be"" and ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"". Both are catchy and employ a ""can't get it out of my head"" feeling, which easily markets the rest of the album. A bit damp compared to their rocky influence in the past, but still a remarkable achievement. Enjoy."
5,Surrender to the Brothers!!!,"First off i have to agree with a reviewer down the way, ""as you listen you start to realize that all other music is petty and unoriginal""!! THAT'S THE TRUTH! Never before has ANY other band moved me in the way the brothers can! It TRULY can't be categorized into a certain genre... it's just POWERFUL! Buy this cd... it will change your life."
5,absolutely brilliant,this is an amazing album. how is it that the chemical brothers consistently produce amazing music? are they just that down w/ the time? or do they set the time?
3,Top notch systems,"I liked there first and second albulms more but its still pretty good. This ones got lots of candy for people listening with top notch systems. In ""under the influence"" crazy stuff is happening with the subs and it nice to have. Allot of the beat is in the sub woofer range so if yours is less than ideal you wont enjoy it as much. There are some good tracks for sure but much fewer all right ones. I agree that they're changeing directions and I think they're trying to get more of a club feel rather than a rave vibe. Most if the time when a band changes people react funny and it takes awhile to grow on you. In sumnation its not there best CD but buy it anyway and hope they come out with a better one soon."
5,Brilliant,"Fans of old seem to be irked with the Chemical Brothers' foray into uncharted territory; but this latest album is tremendous. The Sunshine Underground and Under The Influence really (excuse the pun) shine; certainly a complex, layered romp through electronica."
2,What's all the fuss about ?,"I've never really been into The Chemical Brothers, but after reading generally favourable critical reviews, I thought I'd give Surrender a try, but I came away unimpressed. The first two tracks are OK, but from there it just seems to get dull ( Asleep From Day and Got Glint? spring to mind ). It feels as though the chemical brothers spent more time signing up guest singers for Surrender than they did in actually making the music. I'll stick to Autechre and Aphex Twin."
2,Kraftwerk????,Is it just me or does this CD sound a little too much like Kraftwerk. I think the bros could have made a more original CD.
3,A change of heart,Somewhat of a change in heart from dig your own hole. This album seems to dive into club music in places. It lacks some of the creativity that other songs by c.b. have produced. Please don't tell me that they are going main stream.
3,Worst Album,"The words worst album make it sound terrible, which it isn't. Half the songs on this album are good quality techno. But the first albums are much better, this sounds like a pop album in places. The energy is somewhat lost."
2,Brothers should've done what they do best !!,"Only a few tracks are danceable. I expected a much, much better album. There's quite some experimentation on this album but one buys Chem Bros to dance oneself mad. The Brothers usually Rrrrrrock but I'm sad to say, that in this one, they don't."
2,Where did they leave their ideas?!,"The Chemical Brothers experimented with sound-effects, voice boxes and ambient sounds. Some songs work (""Sunshine Underground"", ""Surrender"") but in the very end, they're just (unfinished) experiments. And not to forget very unmotivated ones.""Surrender"" would have worked if it was an EP with some of the best tracks, but for a whole album it's just too bleak, too simple, too much routine. And the way they worked sounds somewhat indifferent and discouraged. Let's wait for the next album when they finally know which way they want to go. The Brothers have to work it out!"
2,"Perhaps it needs to grown on me, but...","...I am currently disappointed with this release. For any other artist, this could be a four-star album, but for the Chemicals, this album lacks the excitement and audio-candy amazement of Dig Your Own Hole. It's not that the songs are bad, it's just that they are rather lackluster and repetitive compared to their other works (especially the whole second half of Hole). It's unfortunate that the Chemicals didn't include the two B-sides on the ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" 12""--those songs are more reminscent of the classic Chemical style and may even get some play next time I spin."
5,The Chemical Brothers Best Album! Vastly underrated.,"I don't understand why this album gets panned by critics and fans of the Chemical Brothers. In my opinion this is their best CD. So many styles of music were explored here with many having their roots in other genres (shoegaze, house, acid, trance). Overall this is a much more varied album than both Exit Planet Dust and Dig Your Own Hole combined. I was tired of those two albums years and years ago but this one still gets played while hundreds of albums I own don't.Favorite tracks: Asleep From Day, The Sunshine Underground, Surrender, Dream On"
4,It's really good... BUT not great...,the brothers new album is pretty sweet. there are a lot of good tracks.. but there are a few kinda boring tracks.. (sunshine underground/dream on)... like it's good music but it's just not the chemical brotherse. i'm not saying they should stick to one sort of music but just to stick to the music that they are good at... anyway i would recomend buying the album.. SUPERSTAR DJs ROCK ON
4,"stick with ""dig your own hole"".","the chemical brothers always create something new, but with this album they leave you to wonder ""what ever happened to the guys who made ""block rockin' beats"", and ""setting sun"""". don't get me wrong i'm a big chemical brothers fan, but this album after listening to it wants you to experience the freshness of ""dig your own hole"" with ""exit planet dust"". it has it's perks on ""let forever be"",and ""orange wedge"" but to advise you stick to the last album."
5,Clearly one of the better techno CDs this year.,"I bought this CD after hearing the band on Modern Rock Live a few weeks ago. I was extremely impressed with their talent and great personalities. After hearing a few samples from the disc, I was hooked. Plus with Noel Gallagher from Oasis and others, the unique sound of this album is truly a winner. If you like techno music, buy this CD."
2,A tiresome yawn with no real pulse,"There's something overblown about this record. The egos of Tom and Ed seem intent on fuelling their egos and being really 'clever'. They've also let themselves be inspired by tacky synth sounds rather than the ferocios techno leanings of Dig Your Own Hole. Having a whole clutch of guest vocalists in just leaves the record short of identity. Let Forever Be sums up the problems. It's just a lazy retreat of Setting Sun, Noel sounds disinterested, and the boys didn't even conjure up the song themselves. Out Of Control is possibly the only time where a guest singer really gets it right here. Overall there's too much ego and not enough class. Orange Wedge and Got Glint aren't bad but overall this doesn't cut the mustard.And is Hey Boy Hey Girl meant as a joke? It's so cheesy."
1,Don't waste your money on this CD.,"After hearing and reading all the hype about the Chemical Brothers, I thought I'd give them a try. And what not a better way to do that than with their brand new CD? Don't bother, every song sounds like elevator music. If you really like Techno stick to Fatboy Slim."
1,"brothers, chill back off these chemicals please.","Surrender cheapens other forms of music, mainly techno, house, and electro. There are no kick-backs to any era throughout this cd. It's as if the Brothers graduated the Big Beat sound with honors and decided to enroll in first grade tech-house, learning only to doodle with old rave crayons. And the result is a splattering of sounds that are impressionistic of the worst techno art, poorly crafted and unpleasant to the ear. Mazzy Star's contribution is the best track, mainly because it hints at none of the 'childish bouncing in dark rooms with glo sticks' phenomenon that people who enjoy this album seem prone to."
1,DULL DULL DULL,The Chemical Brothers have three things going for them; 1.They picked a cool name that the media likes 2.They are hyped by MTV 3.One Brother has funny glasses. That's it.This new CD is dull lifeless and boring it blazes no new ground nor is it inventive or fun in any manner. I got the impression that this was a soundtrack for a car commerical. DULL.
1,A total disapointment,"What happened? No big beats here. ""Surrender"" isn't going to help their reputation as innovators, that's for sure."
1,The Spice Girls of techno,"Popularity is not an indication of talent! These guys are crap, like most Astralwerks artists."
1,"Harmless, homely and boring","That's all I can say... Bye bye, Chemical Brothers! I'll really miss you"
2,The Brothers didn't work it out,"Now they sound completely different... Well, that's okay if they just haven't forgot to write good songs. ""Orange Wedge"", ""Surrender"" and some others are simply boring, ""Out of Control"" just bad. ""Got Glint?"" sounds like a cheap Daft Punk-copy and ""Asleep from Day"" is more Air than CB. Just the first two tracks (""Music: Response"", ""Under the Influence"") are really great. But that's too little for a complete album. And where was the Chemical Sister Beth Orton? Definately not a masterpiece like ""Dig your own Hole""!"
1,Surrender.. to mtv pop culture..,"*sigh* This cd.. is just awful.. I have a wide range of musical tastes, love the Chems.. but.. they've sold out.. Sure everyone overuses that term.. but honestly... this is horrible.. it's made for children... put 3 or 4 basic layers of music together badly.. overlay repeating annoying vocals for a few min.. and you have Surrender... Let Forever Be has the one nice little riff.. but is bad.. Orange Wedge and Surrender are the 2 best songs on here.. love them.. but you have to skip all over to find them.. ick.. if you like Backstreet Boys type techno.. or bad dance remixes of Titanic songs.. then you should like this.. it's childish horrible stuff.. the poor Chems.. *sigh*"
2,Surrender isn't the Chemical Brothers' Best Effort,"I received this as a gift and was excited because I really enjoyed Dig Your Own Hole. However, this CD disappointed me. Most of the tracks feel mediocre at best, and nothing really stands out. I wouldn't suggest this as a purchase unless you're a die-hard Chemical Brothers fan and already own Dig Your Own Hole. Otherwise, there's much better techno music to be had."
4,Chemical comeback for Simmons and Rowlands.,"The now present electronica scene is ever growing month by month. The so called X culture of Rave music has found a mainstream duo that can take the combination of block rocking beats and psychedelic imagery out of the sunshine underground to bring us a exxentric powerful third album. After the release of ""Dig your own hole"" the Chemical Brothers achieved what few electronica artists had done, brake open what the London ravers knew for quite a while, this is some trippy music.This album is even better. They captured in one album the spirit of acid fueled 60's, the DJ vibe of the 70's, the nonsence of the 80's and the ever needed step toward the future of the 90's.One word:Brilliant."
3,"It stars strong ,but I'm not sure what happens after that.","The first couple song are jammin',but as the CD progresses we slow as we go. I must describe this as a chick CD. My wife loves it and once she borrows it I will never see it again. I gave it a 3 star rating, but I can see why others may give it higher. It's all in taste."
5,CHEMICAL BROTHERS RULE!,If you like Block Rockin' Beats you'll definetley like Surrender. This is the BEST album I've listened to in a long time!! X-CELLENT!
5,"If you like the chemical bros, don't listen to the naysayers","This isn't block rockin' beats -it's better - taking what they know best while mixing it up with Hope Sandoval on Asleep from Day, Bernard Sumner on Out Of Control - it totally flows. The whole album takes you somewhere else, throws you in an acidic groove and leaves you there."
5,chemically enhanced,"I bought dig your own hole and loved it, but always felt that something was missing. This album fills in the missing gaps. Excellant."
4,hard-rocking and easy to listen to.,"when i first saw this album at a local record store i was very sceptical. but i decided to give it a listen and hold onto my receipt just in case. well now the receipt is in the trash and ""surrender"" is safe and sound in the front of my CD case where it will stay. this album starts off really strong with the first three cuts then seems to go into a different realm of techno that you really don't seem to here much. there are a couple of cuts i really don't care for but other than that this album kicks butt."
3,It's just okay. Nothing more.,"Songs like ""Under the Influence"" and ""Got Glint?"" are great. And ""Surrender"" sounds somewhat like Brain Eno. But then there are tracks like ""Asleep from Day"" which should have been better named ""Asleep from this song"". ""The Sunshine underground"" is good, too. But when you've heared it about two, three times, you have enough of it.""Surrender"" is not as cool-relaxed as ""Exit Planet Dust"" and not as complex and unforgettable as ""Dig your own Hole"". No innovative songs or sounds, no big moments, just plain Pop.It may be good but don't expect playing it forever!"
4,"Doesn't have typical Chem. Bros. sound, but still is good!","When I heard the first track on this album, I thought this was going to be cheesy, but as I listened to the other tracks, I started liking it. Some good tracks are: ""Under the Influence"", ""Out of Control"", ""Got Glint?"", ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"", and ""Surrender"". The others are fairly good to listen to as well."
5,Bravestarr - The Complete Series - 65 Episode Collection,"An old tv series set in the future on a planet called new texas about a sherriff with the powers of 4 animals, hawk, bear, puma and wolf, to protect the people of new texas from the bad guys. This is a very good series for kids as it has a good storyline and each episode ends with a lesson for kids to learned."
4,Bravestarr - The INcomplete series,"It has been good to see Bravestarr again after all these years but the product name is slightly deceptive.It says 'complete series', well I would say a 'complete' series should contain the original, feature length pilot. This doesn't, so it isn't complete.That is the only caveat to this box set, I would have given it 5 stars if not for that."
4,THE GREAT MARSHALL IS BACK!!,"Great color really great i watch the episodes in my full hd 40"" tv and looks really good.My only complain is the lack of special features. I love the show its amazing and have a very great episodes.Even more than He-man i think. This is the best show of filmation.The package is good and contains a little book with de name of episodes and a trivia with interesting details. Dont think twice this is a must have."
5,The Last Hurrah!!!!!,"Bravestarr was the last project Filmation released & I am pleased they released the entire series as opposed to volumes,The collectors such as myself who purchase these classics are fiends for nostalga & I wish for more classic late seventies,eighties & early nineties animation for my collecticn.If somebody knows whom to contact,ask for Filmation Mighty Mouse to be released next.But I am very satisfied with my purchase & it's timely delivery"
2,Inaccurate description,"I had been looking for a ONE peice tube pan to bake pound cakes in for quite some time. I think the last one I purchased was at KMart. I hadn't had any luck finding one locally, so I decided to try Amazon. From looking at this product description and the photos, it looked like a one peice pan to me, and it didn't say that it was a 2 peice. Well, I got the cake pan today, and as usual, Amazon is prompt with their delivery. But this was not what I wanted. I will most likely keep it, as the shipping to return it would not be worth returning it. If anyone knows of a non-stick large one peice tube pan (not a bundt pan) please let me know where I can find it. I'll continue to shop Amazon as I have for years, but this is the first time I have been disappointed with my purchase. Perhaps I should have asked the seller more questions about the product before purchasing. Thanks, Debbie James nursedld@hotmail.com"
1,"Take it back, please...","Ack, puh!That describes my view of the game. The graphics are nice, and there are some features not in previous versions of Civilization that were also cool, but after paying. . . for the game, I have still never finished a game.It takes too long, it is too complex in some areas, and units/technologies become out-dated too quickly.If you are considering purchasing this game, DON'T! CTP2 is supposedly in the works, but better yet Civ III will be appearing some time next year."
2,Sid Meyer's Civ 2 Sequel Was Better Than This One,"Activision dumped Civ creator Sid Meyer, then battled him in court for the Civilization name and, irrationally, won. They released this mediocre disimprovement of Civ 2. It's nothing more than the same game with a few extra types of each concept.Sid also lacks any serious creativity in his sequel, but at least his version, Alpha Centauri, has some big changes in it, like taking place on Alpha Centauri right after the Civ2 ship lands there, a natural sequel.What we really needed, of course, was the ability to manage a civilization which spanned multiple planets, both in maps on the surface and with trade/travel/war in the spaceways."
2,"Interesting, but not great","I got this game when it first came out, played it, and it was great. A few games later you start to notice that the all mighty AI, is all very much predictable. To a historical sence.... when my phalanx are able to fight along side my space marines.. it just kinda throws the game off. There is no option in the game to update units that have been deemed obsolete. So you can either send them off to battle to die or disband them. Either way, they will be marked up as a loss on the score card. If you are thinking of buying it, please have a system far beyond what they recommend. I have a P366 w/ 32 MB of RAM and when my civilization reaches about 20 billion people, it crawls. To give you an examble, I can end a turn and go take a shower. Overall, it is good for about 10 games."
5,awesome,This game is fun. pure and simple. control an empire to destroy your opponents. i haven't played the other civs. so i can't compare. but i like this game.
2,NOT a quality successor to the Civilization series,"I was very disappointed with this game. The graphics are a step up, but the new klunky interface detracts from playability, even once you get used to it. My biggest gripe is that the technology tree wasn't expanded, but rather completely replaced. While this contributes somewhat to a new, fresh game, the elimination of key technologies and their functional replacement by other, more esoteric ones detracts from the realism possessed by its predecessors. Those happy with the improvements in graphics, units, technologies, and user interface Civilization II boasted over the original will be seriously disappointed if you're looking for the same in this title. I've already stopped playing Call to Power, but I still play Civ II occasionally, for what that says."
1,Very Poorly Done,"This game is just CivII with a new coat of paint. The game is boring, the AI of the computer is weak. I don't recomend it to anyone. The tech support on the web didn'y solve any of my install problems that I had. When I called ech support I got the ""Is your computer pluged in?"" line of questions that got me no where."
2,Terrible Succesor,"With all the great reviews that this game recieved, and having a passion for the previous editions of Civilization, i decided this was a must have software.After the 50 years you spend trying to figure out how evrything works, you start to feel the passion for the game, but It is not like the other ones. It is too complicated and too complex, it takes the fun out of the game. The other versions, were simpler and more straight forward. They tried to make this one so good, that they ended up screwing up the game. Buy Civilization 2, it is cheaper and better than this one."
3,Call To Confused,"There is a misconception about this game. Civilization fans come to Call to Power and they are dissapointed. The game play is much different and they are left confused. There is a very good reason for that. It doesn't have much to do with the game itself but the misconception that it is supposed to be the third in the Civlization Series.As quoted from the web site for the upcoming True sequel: Activision is the developer of Call to Power and Call to Power II. There is no relationship between CivIII and Call to Power other than they originally shared Civilization in their title. Due to some legal wrangling between Hasbro and Activision, Call to Power will drop Civilization from its' title.Die Hard Civilization fans will want to take note that this is not a Civilization game at all, and wait for the true Civ. III later this year."
2,Activision's big mistake,"This is the worst CIV game out there. They changed the interface so drasticly that it is no longer any fun. They renamed all the wonders and lots of the technologies and worst of all, it doesn't feel like a civ game. This game may have good graphics, but thats it. It is way to complicated. My settelers can't even bulid roads. The AI ain't great and they always appear early. Get Civ 2 and pray Activision doesn't touch the CIV license agian"
3,Intriguing But Unsatisfying Patchwork,"This strange book is mostly bits and pieces of quirky California history (disjointed, but entertaining - clearly the best part of the book) with a tiring amount of abuse heaped on then-California governor Ronald Reagan, who, in Gentry's view, was unmitigated evil. These elements are wrapped inside a pedestrian sci-fi plot about California being destroyed by ""The Big One"" earthquake. The end product is an unsatisfying mixture of fact, fiction, and opinion. The bits of history were good, and the book should have ended with that. Like California at the end of the book, the rest of this opinion-essay-novel should disappear into the Pacific Ocean; but more quietly."
5,The Last Days of the Late Great State of California,This is a Sci fi story about a giant earthquake in California that sends part of California into the ocean. Starts by explaining the importance of California to America and to the world.
1,Skip to the end,"Found this book on a friend's bookshelf and it sounded like a good read. Unfortunately, not true...Even if you grew up in the Sixties (which I did), much of the first 300 pages or so are just a mish-mash of commentary and pseudo history. Do yourself a favor and skip to Part Four where you'll find a marginally-diverting scenario if California experienced ""the big one."" Worth 30 minutes, tops."
4,breathtaking in humor and scope,"Gentry's novel is the account of the events surrounding California's cataclysmic slide into the Pacific Ocean in the 1970s. In pseudo-documentary style, the daily lives of individuals among the multitude are sketched in brief vignettes that give the flavor of California living in the Seventies. Cultists, topless waitresses, Ronald Reagan and enviromentalists are depicted with an affectionate touch. Humor and pathos are mixed in generous parts as the disaster unfolds. I would recommend this book for anyone who ever laughed at the nuts out west while secretly wishing to be one"
5,GREAT Fiction/Fact About California!,"I bought this book after I came to CA in 1967 and man, was I ever ready for ""The Big One"" after reading this book. Many facts are in this book as well as a fictionalized account of the earthquake we WILL get one day!What is happening right today with the economy here in CA is covered as this state has today, 10% of the nation's population but 30% of the nation's welfare recipients. No wonder we are going broke!An excellent book for both the facts and yes, the fiction as well. HIGHLY recommended!"
5,KICKASS GUITARS!,"Great CD! These guys are NOT too old to rock...but their humor is refreshing! The songs are well crafted, thought out and interesting. These guys aren't the usual Yngwie clones. They don't do 1000 mph arppegio's...but they do shred...BIG time. Lots of feeling an emotion in their playing. If I had to make comparisons, I'd put em somewhere between Eddie Van Halen (the early years) Hendrix, Vai, Satch, Schenker.Much to choose from on this CD. Many styles are highlighted but the main focus is hard rock/metal. I'd like to ask them how they came up with the CD title...cracks me up.I strongly recommend this Cd for anyone into instrumental guitar music. These guys are onto something great-JS"
3,Habenaro? Not according to the label,"While the taste is good, the heat is not there. Unfortunately, I didn't read the label before I got it. I assumed that it was a habanero-based sauce going from their label. With the first taste, I grabbed the bottle and looked at the ingredients...NO habanero peppers. ""Ingredients: Red ripe Jalapeno peppers, distilled vinegar, salt, spices and Jack Daniel's Black Label Whiskey.""Really? REALLY? Change your label to ""Historic Lynchburg Tennessee Whiskey Jalapeno Hot Sauce.""Some people are looking for more heat. No reason to lie to people, Lynchburg Merchandise Company."
1,Misses the point,"the author is entirely focused on how he would like to worship that he forgets Whom he is there to worship. He also misses the point of the ""seeker sensitive"" service entirely."
5,CONEY HATCH - THE BEST OF THREE C.D. !,"GREAT ROCK-N-ROLL ! THEIR SINGERS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE FOREIGNER/BAD COMPANY ! THE GUITAR RIFFS IN MY OPINION ARE BETTER THAN BOTH BANDS ! CHECK IT OUT, YOU WILL LIKE !"
5,has dark tones with crisp suttle bass,this band created a sound of the new wave but with the same constant baet of rock and roll. It is unfortunate that this band is no longer around to pump out some of the finist music that is worthy of being purchase with money.
2,Very Disappointing!,"This CD is extremely disappointing! Not enough of Cher's voice on this audio biography, which seems to ramble on about Cher's life in a very boring way. If you want to find out more about Cher's life this is a must but I suggest you buy Cher's biography ""The First Time"" at Amazon for all the real facts. Give this one a miss!"
1,Doesn't Hold Charge,"This jumpstarter doesn't hold a charge. It only worked decent the first time, which I used to inflate some tires. I read not to over charge so I only charge a few hours. Checked the indicator and it was in the green zone. Only lasted 1 minute! I charge 8 hours, same result. I charge 24 hours, same result. Luckily I have not needed it to jumpstart my car!"
1,Can be used as a camping tool but don't expect to use it to jump your car!,"I used this on a cross country drive vacation across the US. It was used to keep the DC cooler with cold drinks and on occasion (twice to be exact), jump the car when the battery died. Both times, no luck even though the Wagan said it had full charge. Luckily, someone in the parking lot had jumper cables the first time. The second time though, I had to wait for a tow truck. Although, insurance covered the jump from the truck...the $20 tip came out of my pocket! Don't buy this thing as it is junk!!!!!"
4,Wagan 400 watt,"This has worked great for my truck, bike and boat.My only issue is the recharge cable input is under the plastic shield making it harder to charge."
2,Its Just OK,The Power Dome Was Not Made to last! The 1st Time I charged it I was able to jump 7 cars (it does not have the power to start a pickup) after that 5 jumps per charge. The Real Down Side To The Power Dome is the charging Cords. The Wall Charger Was Only Good For Two Charges (THE WIRES are to THIN so be careful when you are rolling it up to put it away) The Cigarette Lighter Cord Worked Once! Why It stop working I don't! And Yes My Cigarette Lighter Still Works and so Does my Car Charger Phone Cord.
5,Good for the drive in auto theatre,I bought this power source for running heated blankets at the drive in auto theatre. The power source works well and keeps me powered and the blankets from roadpro keep me warm. I wish the battery had a bigger storage unit but for what it's sold as i love it. I'm thinking about buying another at Pep Boys.
1,JUNK!!!,"I had to send this back three times, at my own expense of course. It will not hold a charge and never has. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. I bought a cheap one from Harbor Freight and it has never failed."
4,Always works great,"Never any issues with this product. Keep it charged and it works just fine. I use it for the car, truck, boats and farm equipment."
2,Faulty Switch,"I was pleased with the unit, using the air compressor several times to inflate low tires.Then the switch stuck. Won't go into the ON position. Went online but have found no solution.Looks to be a solid piece of equipment, but judging from other reviews, that is not the case."
2,What happened to quality & communication?,One of the reasons I purchased the power dome was the air compressor however after ten mintues of use the air compressor stopped working. I contacted Wagan thru the email to make them aware of my problem. They noted my email was received I am now waiting for a response. That was 2 wks. ago.
4,Power to spare,"I like the unit very much, great features, handy to carry.. Pumps up tires in seconds.I just wish it had a self regulating charger. I can't remember to plug it back in to keep it charged up,"
2,Unit looks good and makes sense but has problems,"Unit looks good and makes sense but has problems:1)The manual is unclear and says that before jumpstarting, all switches should be off. However, in fact the jump start safety switch needs to be on.2) It had only enough power to barely turn over, let alone start, my Mazda Millennium."
4,I'm sure glad I had it when I needed it!!,"We purchased this Wagan Power Dome to take on vacation, hoping we'd never need it. Turns out that we did, but we didn't yet know enough about how to use it to get the clips onto a side post battery, and needed help from someone else. Of course, this is not the Power Dome's fault. Later, our other car's battery died, and with the posts on top of that battery, it was a cinch to use and the Power Dome started the car right up. It gives me peace of mind to have this product in the trunk of my car."
1,"Tried it, but couldn't jump my car",I bought this jumper and fully charged it for a few days. When my car was dead I tried to jump it but apparently this Jumper didn't have enough juice. I then tried my older portable jumper and that was 2/3 charge and that was able to jump my car. I think this one didn't have enough amperage for my car since it was completely dead. This probably works well for most people because their cars aren't fully drained. However if your car is totally drained I would not completely rely on it.
1,not happy,This product did not live up to my expectations. The air compressor got too hot and melted internal hoses and the junpstart could not start a dead battery. I would not recommend this item.
2,"Bad as a power supply, good as a booster: and Good customer service!","My Wagan Powerdome was a disappointment as it only lasted just over a year before failing to hold a charge. Wagan Inc. made it right by replacing the out-of-warranty unit if I paid to ship the old unit. This is a booster unit, do not purchase it as a power source. A power source unit is a deep-cell battery. The Wagan Powerdome is not a deep-cell battery, it is a jumper battery. Jumper batteries aren't intended to be used as a power supply. This battery won't recover from repeated deep discharges. When you hear the alarm sound on the inverter, STOP USING THE POWERDOME UNTIL YOU RECHARGE IT! If you must have inverter power when the alarm sounds, attach the battery cables to a vehicle battery and turn the battery safety switch to ""on"" on the Powerdome. Otherwise, using the Powerdome after the alarm sounds will discharge the battery beyond recovery and you'll have an 18-pound boat anchor!"
1,NOT as useful as I had hoped,This will run a fan - good for power outage in hot weather. It will also run a 3-bulb ceiling fixture - but little else.it can NOT even power a TOASTER! Nor microwave. Not even the smallest space-heater.it MIGHT run a sump-pump (the reason I bought it) - have not had the opportunity to try that.I am VERY disappointed - uses are limited
2,"love it, but......","I loved this little machine. I kept it in my car to inflate my tires, charge things and jump my car. I must have left the jumper switch on because it discharged the entire battery, so now I cant use it unless I buy another one, or a new battery for the generator. Its under warranty but i live in the Virgin Islands and to ship it back would probably cost more than the generator."
1,Made to break.,"Yeah, I bought one to prepare for certain auto emergencies. WRONG! First, the jumper cables did not work - period. Maybe there was a disconnect inside the case, which cannot be opened. So what? The air compressor should make keeping it worthwhile. WRONG! The compressor began smoking heavily after 4 uses and subsequently quit. Thought about returning it but postage (it's pretty heavy) and iffy customer service discouraged me. It was finally donated to a thrift store."
5,Wagan Power Dome is a hit with my man,"I bought this as a gift for my guy who ""has everything"" in the way of tools since he is a mechanic and used to be in construction. At first he said it was nice but didn't think he'd find much use for it, but charged it up and tried it out, and within 2 weeks he found so many uses for it he became pretty excited about the flexibility of this portable tool. I'd say I hit a home run with this purchase! I recommend this for any man or woman who uses tools, goes camping,travels in an RV or any woman who does not want to get stuck on the road with a flat tire or dead battery."
5,it has never failed,"I rate the Wagan Dome 5 stars because it has never missed to work for me. If there is a better starter I don't know.I own a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe, which I keep in good conditions and the times that I needed a jump it worked with no problems.I also have used it to help other motorists, free of charge, with the same results.In my humble opinion it counts if one keeps his car well. I thinks that if your car has problems other than the battery you cannot blame the starter.I have been owning the Dome for a few years now and so far I have no complains."
1,"This Wagan is a no-go, just like how my car was.","I have had this power dome for a year now, and I tried thrice to jump start my small car, and it never worked. All that this device is to me is an heavy air pump and flash light (torch).Eventually I traded in my beloved vehicle, but I only wish that I could trade in this piece-of-crap for something better or at least get my money back."
1,Never worked,I bought this product one year ago. Did not use until recently. It did not charge and whatever power was left was not enough to fill my bycicle tires. Tried to charge again for two days: No luck.
4,Lowest Price: $64.95,"As of this post...Highest Price: $100.04Lowest Price: $64.95Average Price: $94.66Tracking Since: February 3, 2008 3:10:37 AM PST"
1,Wagan 400-Watt Power Dome,this looked so cool all in one but it sucked the fan went out the first week i owed it and the jumper cable could not jump a car if it want to....not a good tool .....bad bad bad
1,waste of money,I bought this item about 14 months ago.I am constantly in remote areas in the winter so I thought this would be a good idea.Well I was wrong I used it twice to put some air in my tires and it now doesn't charge on either mode of charging.I am glad I did not depend on this piece of crap to help me in the winter or I would still be stuck.I would never buy an item made by this so called tech company again.I wish I could give no stars.
1,Junk!,"This thing is junk! Will not hold a charge for more than an hour. I full charged this thing, went to jump my truck and NO CHARGE! I've charged it over night and it still will not hold a charge. Anyone looking to buy this, my advice, save your money! JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!"
2,Beware!,"I'm surprised people are still buying this product. I bought my unit about two years ago. Was able to start my weak car battery about 7 times. However, when I plugged it into an electric main to recharge it, it never got charged. The red light never changed to green to confirm that it has recharged. I wish I had read reviews on this product before I bought it."
2,Generic documentary for uneducated masses,"If you don't know anything about Afghanistan's history, culture, or people... Or that there's a war going on. This documentary might help you out, I've done enough reading about the history and culture of Afghanistan to find this docu. very dry and boring. Just my 2 cents."
5,every american should watch,This should be shown to every single American. It's nearly impossible to watch this and argue for this war. What are we fighting for? What are we winning? NOTHING.
2,Do not be fooled...,"Mario Del Monaco and Tito Gobbi do perform in this piece... However,this is a film for those who does not really like opera and out of curiosity, just to find out the story, would not mind to sit down and listen to one or two tiny little pieces of the opera along with it. All the beautiful music of Verdi stays in the background, and all the captivating arias, duettos, etc. are simply left out and even The Quartet! You can forget about it, THERE IS NO QUARTET! just a ""headline"" of it. My 2 stars are not intended to the opera performance, but to the director of the film."
2,Not an Opera,"This is not close to an opera. We are given only a few arias and snatches of orchestral passages. The story is nearly left to stand on its own as a movie--which it does not do very well. It falls flat. If you have ever--seeing Shakespeare's OTHELLO--felt the need of Verdi's OTELLO music, you will have a similar, but much stronger, feeling here. The voices are excellent--what little we hear of them. Was orchestral sound no better than this in 1946?"
2,The Collection-Paolo Conte,"Although I am not a regular listener of foreign music, I enjoyed Paolo Conte's Greatest Hits very much. However, my second attempt at this type of music has left me disappointed. The Collection contains songs with rather unusual tempos and rhythms which, I believe, require an acquired taste to enjoy. If you are not a regular listener of Paolo Conte, I would suggest trying his more popular works before purchasing this one."
5,Here's what Publishers Weekly had to say...,"In their August 2, 2004 issue Publishers Weekly had this to say about the 1-Hour Guidebooks:San Diego-based Bermond Press will debut its vividly designed 1-Hour Guidebooks line [in November] with Hamlet: The 1-Hour Guidebook. The look fo the series was a top priority: ""How can anyone learn from a study guide that looks like a repair manual? We wanted to present the plays with the respect and reverence they deserved."" In addition to graphic character charts and illustrated scene summaries, the books feature a CD of actors reading the play. Romeo & Juliet and Macbeth will join the line at the beginning of the year, with three more of Shakespeare's best due in 2005"
3,Disappointed,"This is definitely not a cd to buy young children or even young teens. I bought this cd for my 17 year old son and though it states that it is explicit, I did not realize how much bad language there actually is on this cd. The language on this cd, I feel is worse than hip-hop. I haven't listened to the whole cd, but my son said that all of the songs pretty much have a lot of cussing in them. I don't know why they had to use that language when the songs would have been better without it. A few bad words here and there aren't too bad, but this cd is riddled with them. It's really disappointing. I don't really care for this cd because of the language, but my son likes it (but then again he is a 17 year old boy!) so that's why I rated it like I did."
5,fun times,i got this along with season one and three all at the same time needless to say i didn't sleep for two days! I went on a binge watching this Classic anime from my childhood I recommend it for all those who haven't seen it!
3,Yu Yu Seasons!!,"I really enjoyed this season. but I wish that they had finished the tournament, instead of stopping before the finals were over because there were still three fights to go!"
5,The Dark Tournament on blu-ray,"After watching Season One on blu-ray, it was a no-brainer to revisist Season Two with another frame-by-frame remaster and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 English and 2.0 Japanese dubbing, both of which are excellent in their own rights. Speaking of dubbing, the English version has indeed been redubbed to address the characer Suzuki *ahem* sorry, the beautiful Suzuki, by the Japanese pronunciation. This time around the episodes are split as such:Disc 1: Episodes 29-38Disc 2: Episodes 39-47Disc 3: Episodes 48-56--(plus additional trailers and textless opening/closing music videos)The Dark Tournament is in full swing this season and Yusuke's team members all show amazing new abilities and powers. From the Dragon of the Darkness Flame to the resurfacing of Yoko Kurama, this season ups the ante and brings the heat."
5,YU YU Hakusho on Bluray!!!,I love how good this looks on bluray. Funimation really outdid themselves. I love YU YU Hakusho. It's such a good anime. This is Season Two. Contains 28 Episodes. All are from the Dark Tournament Saga.
5,AWESOME =),"the product was delivered on time and with great quality. Exactly what i ordered , thank you =)"
2,"Purchased for Class, Obvs","It's not likely you're buying this book to read for pleasure, neither did I.I find the subject matter interesting, but the presentation is terrible. Required reading for my Acoustics class, I found this book extremely dry - one of the more frustrating aspects though, is the way the book is organized. It seems that the editors haven't spent any time worrying about the readability of this book (for whatever reason.) The author refers to tables that are pages before and after text, leaving the reader constantly flipping back and forth in a chapter to refer to diagrams."
3,Took too long to get to me,"The book is great, especially for my class. The only problem I had was I ordered the book on December 12th and was supposed to receive it by December 20th, but did not get it until January 7th."
3,Dangerous Curves.,"Dangerous Curves is a mediocre movie it is worth watching for the moments Leslie Nielsen is in(a very dry performance but He was great),and for the PoorMan's Porsche(Don't care for Porsches or Ferraris)aka the wanna-be Corvette, as well the Mondial Ferrari,and some of the women.But the most beautiful girl in the movie is the Mexican one with Huge front bumpers.don't expect this however to be a skin-a-max with the obligatory shots as they say,it is hardly funny or entertaining and the plot is a rip-off of Corvette Summer and Stingray(the movie not the show 1978).Overall an Okay Movie."
5,BILLIE MAKES A GREAT COMEBACK.,"BILLIE MAKES A GREAT COMEBACK WITH THE NEW SONG ""DAY AND NIGHT"". THE STARGATE MIX IS GREAT.AND I LOVE THE B-SIDE SONG ""TINTED EYES"".THE FRIDAY HOPE REMIX IS COOL TOO. IF YOU THOUGH ""SHE WANTS YOU"" WAS GOOD,YOU GOTTA BUY THIS."
3,This is ok,"Ok, I'm not the biggest Billie fan, in fact I'm not really even a fan, but I liked this song when I heard it. Now I'm plain sick of it. Rundown:1. Day And Night Duhhhh! The main song which is ok. 3/52. Tinted Eyes Weird not my type of song 2/53. Friday Hope Mix Just a remix, very boring 2/5Actually, this single was disappointing. Except for the first song the whole single is not worth it. If you like Billie wait until her album comes out don't buy this!"
3,not as pictured,"The picture is not the product you receive. The lock that goes in the tongue of the trailer that I received is not the one shown in the picture, which is why I purchased this product. It is a cheaper version!!! I consider this picture misleading, and should be updated to show the correct items you will receive."
5,The perfect all in one kit!,"Bottom line up front: I've used this for four years now. It has survived the salt of German winters, the mud in which I routinely submerge my Jeep, and thousands of miles of towing. This works great, and it has a solution for all your trailering needs right there in the kit."
1,MASTER LOCK 3774DAT KEY ALIKE LOCK SET,"The best price I could find, in my city the lock set was about $70.00 and to try to buy each piece individually was close to 75.00. This was a great deal and free shipping to boot. I recieved the package in about four days.The only locking system to have if you own a Uility Trailer."
4,Useful set,I have found two of the three locks in this set useful. The hitch lock did not fit on my trailer. Thus this only gets four stars.
3,Doesn't fit Ford Explorer Factory Hitches for 2006 and Up.,"The product seems to be durably made, but the receiver hitch lock is too wide at the ends to fit in my factory installed hitch on the side where the electrical connections are made. What else can I say? It's useless to me. It's a bad design on the part of Ford, Master Lock or both.The other two parts seem well made, and they fit my trailer OK.I'm disappointed, but I've decided to return this set.1 star for the receiver hitch5 stars for each of the other pieces"
2,Coupler lock and coupler latch lock not for my trailer,Well this looks like a great idea... however.. it does NOT fit all trailers or coupler latches. (We have a Reese which it states it fits) The coupler lock (for the ball) was way toooo small for my trailer ball...says its fits a 2 5/16 ball... there is not way! The coupler latch lock did not fit at all. It was too large on the ends to fit snuggly. (hit up against the trailer tonge hitch sides) It could have been cut off in seconds! Did not even try the hitch lock... why spend all this money for only one piece that works. I had to send it back. We are still looking for that perfect keyed alike trailer coupler and hitch set. The search continues.....
2,Receiver lock not LONG enough,"The pin of the receiver lock is not long enough. It's about 1/4"" short. Th4, this receiver lock is useless for me."
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I liked the pretty descriptions. In some places it read like poetry or a very nice travelogue. I was hoping for more action but I read anyway.Got a chuckle on page 208 when Mattie is reading _Before Women Had Wings_. And Fowler refers to herself as a ""Florida author, a young woman...who actually lived nearby--I think on the barrier island to our east.""The cover was awfully pretty, like a painting."
1,Rembering Blue means to remember horrible writing!,"This book was the first one I tried to read by Fowler. It was also the last. Everytime I see a Fowler book all I can think of is how much I hated Blue. I hated it so much I had to get it out of my house. The author uses too many words to describe a scene. Clearly she doesn't understand that sometimes less is more. If I could give this book 0 stars, I would."
2,Remembering Blue,First time reader of a book from one of Oprah's authors. Found the book cumbersome; a real chore to read. Lacked continuity: sometimes Mattie's thoughts were in journal form:other times just incorporated in the general story. The two stars is warranted by: 1) the development of the family and 2) the primordial mythology. (will not be recommending at my book reveiw club).
4,A Different Kind of Florida,"This book has a beautiful cover, not that I ""judge a book by its' cover"", but it is a good start.This area of Florida is rarely known by outsiders and Connie May Fowler has captured the essence of the land, the ocean and the people. I could almost taste the salt on my lips and see the beauty of the ocean. People who live near and grow up near the ocean have a love for it that is hard to explain. It is well written, the story is believable and moves along at a good pace. I will suggest it to other readers for a change in the type of story they generally read."
4,The circle of life can be poetry.,This book is certainly filled with beautiful prose that rings out with a mythical quality. It is written as a memoir of Mattie Blue and her life on a small island off the coast of Florida. Her husband Nick and his family have always worked the sea and he brings his bride Mattie home to be a part of it. What follows is a beautiful tale of idyllic love that simply rolls like waves across the page.There are many enjoyable characters and the book is a pleasant one to read. There is a theme of dolphins and how they intermingle with the humans that live amongst them. Many of the Blue family members have succumbed to the sea with tragic endings. I enjoyed this book. It got a bit slow in the middle but I hung in and was not disappointed with the heartfelt ending. Kelsana 4/27/01
4,A Book with Heart,"This is a touching love story. A young widow, Mattie, recounts her husband, Nick's, life, their time together and the circumstances that stole him from her.We are able to watch Mattie grow from a frightened, shy young woman into a passionate, loving wife who finds strength from the ocean and from the women in Nick's family. Along the way Mattie finally discovers herself.Fowler's writing in this novel is beautiful and the images are incredible. I am looking forward to reading more books by this talented author."
4,Poignant storytelling,"As a few reviewers have noted, the book gains momentum with each chapter. Did Fowler plan that? or was it more a matter of the flow of the story grabbing her at about page 100? One wonders.Stay with this book. It is a gem of a story, and it will prompt you to remember that we are meant to live passionately; we are meant to surrender to ourselves and our yearnings; and that we are meant to care about and for others.The book gives us an experience that teems with life -- of the sea, of the island, of the forgotten coast along the Big Bend (Carrabelle, Eastpoint, Appalachicola), where most still struggle to make ends meet by fishing for oysters and shrimp.You will fall in love with all of the characters, and you will fall in love with the setting. This is fine writing and even finer storytelling. Fowler is a treat."
5,Fowler Triumphs!,"You can almost here the waves crashing and taste the oceans salty breeze in the love story set along Floridas Gulf Coast. In Connie May Fowlers forth novel, a young widow recounts her husbands life, their passionate affair and the tragedy that stole him from her after two short years. And though the outcome is revealed from the onset, the beauty of Fowler's prose is so compelling that you can't help read on. As much as it is a love story, REMEMBERING BLUE is also a tale of the battle between man and nature. Mostly it,s a book with heart and soul, that readers won't forget anytime soon."
5,I don't know how I traveled before without it!,"I thought I was a highly astute traveler; I'd read other guides before. Not until I read this marvelous tome did I realize how inept I was at negotiating through travel's often treacherous waters. I've been using many of these tips on recent trips and... lo and behold... now things go so much more smoothly! I've even gotten refunds from travel disasters which I didn't know were available before.I was visiting Broadway in NYC recently and, it turns out, this book has been turned into a Broadway show (of the same name)! The show is every bit as funny as the book."
5,The Plot Thickens....,"""With Child"" has been my constant companion for the past several hours: it went to lunch with me, and to dinner, and spent a quiet afternoon in between. What kept me going was not the apparent plot--as I read the book, I thought there were two separate plots, the search for Dio and the search for Jules, and I found them quite loosely tied together. Then I completed the last scene and realized that this wonderful book is a web of plots, based on the them of being 'with child', of finding children on many levels. There's Jules and Dio, both lost; Lee's need to have a child despite her lesbianism and her disability; and Rosa surrounded by children. There's the search for missing children at the center of this book, and the search for love at the emotional core. It's the search for partners and for family relationships which motivates all the characters, even the most villanous, and which holds the actions together in a tightly-knit whole cloth"
4,"Different, but I liked it","This book was a little different than the first two books, but I enjoyed reading it and finished it off rather quickly (a sure sign that it was good). I still have a hard time with the realities of Kate's job, but I can overlook some of that. I enjoyed this book a little more than the last, where I felt like I'd missed something. This book did a better job of filling in the ""while you were away"" time gap. Still think that more could be done with the intimacy in the relationship, but that's nitpicking."
4,"More Martinelli, less mystery in this book","Before I nitpick, let me say that I enjoyed reading this book. It's well written with interesting characters. It just isn't quite the masterpiece that the first two Martinelli books are.Much of this book focuses on Kate's personal life crises - Lee has left to recover with a long lost aunt and Kate doesn't know where she stands. She spends more and more time with Jules, the soon to be step-daughter of her partner, Al Hawkin. (Readers of the previous books will remember the child genius.) She spends some of the time tracking down a runaway friend of Jules. In the second half of the book, Jules disappears during a road trip to Seattle. Still, Kate isn't allowed to participate in the the active search and acts policelike only on the fringes.Bottom-line: Probably a worthwhile read for existing fans of the series but wouldn't be the best book for starting the Martinelli series (which is terrific overall)."
3,A liitle dull,"I found this novel a little slower and a little less suspensful than some of her other Kate novels and the ending drops a bit - I thought it needed wrapping up with a few more details, but then I won't spoil the ending for those who have not read it. It does develop more of the relationships between Kate and her lover as well as her partner in the police force as well as friends. This is important information for other novels.I think I like her Mary Russell novels better."
3,The Chicken Soup is Cold,"I was given this book by my grandmother a few months ago, and I was slightly disappointed. Every one of my friends have read this book and they have all said that it was inspirational and life-changing. It did not change my life in any way, yet it did offer some perspective on life itself. The stories in this book are extremely depressing, and some are to sappy to be true. Instead of inspiring me, I just got depressed. In fact, I could not help but cry at some of the situations these teenagers were in. I do not recommend this book to people who are not good listeners, but those who love a little inspiration (or depression) will love this book."
3,Have ABSOLUTELY nothing else to do? Read this book!,"Well, the book was um, fine. There was nothing really wrong with it but it doesn't even compare to the first two. Some of the stories in this are just way too sappy, over-dramatized(sorry- is that even a word?)or depressing. That, or unrealistic or hard to relate to. If you're still thinking about reading this book, I'd suggest you TRY to find an alternative way of passing time."
3,What can i say?,"This was, at its best, a sweet book. I certainly didn't find it as moving as the other two, and some of the stories were rather cheesy and i found it hard to relate to them....I love Chicken Soup, but my favourite sections (Love/Relationships and Friendship) were really dull in this one, and some of the stories weren't very well written.Try it anyway... if you're a chicken soup fan, it'll do you good."
5,Agreat book,"I thought this was a really good book. I'm thirteen now , but I read a Chicken Soup For the soul book for the first time when I was twelve. I have Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 2 and 3. And my younger brother recently got Chicken Soup for the Kid's Soul. Some of the stories I read didn't apply to me, but I still enjoyed reading them, and seeing how the different people overcame different situations. I was especially touched by one story entitled "" Tell Me Why You cry"" in Chicken Soup for the teenage Soul two. But I won't say what is was about. I'll let you find out for yourself. Because every teenage kid, or twelve and eleven year-olds should read these books. Because whether they make an impact on your life or not, they will show you that you can overcome anything if you try."
3,"Good, but not as moving",I was really happy when I found out that there was another Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul and rushed out to get it. The stories are not as good and I havn't felt connected to any of them. I love the stories of first love and relationships but I can't even remember one really happy one. I think everybody should read the first two but don't rush out to get the third.
1,This Book is a Load of ****!,"Okay, anyone who is interested in books.........don't read this! It is terrible! IF i could give it no stars, or even negative stars, i would say AMEN! I it so sappy that i couldn't go to work for a week-- I just stayed home and barfed, it was sooooo disgusting! NEVER ever read it! The only point of writing it is to suck you in to buying their merchandise, and then brainwash you so you can't escape.........DON'T fall for it! Be STRONG!"
3,"Thayers is great, but alcohol is not",I've tried Thayers witch hazel in peach and rose. Rose (alcohol free) was fantastic. Peach dried my skin out.Thayers witch hazel is great stuff and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I simply do wish the peach and lemon varieties were alcohol free.
1,Kings of Ayakulik,"This was a poorly made video. There is only about ten minutes of worth while content. The fishing appears to be concentrated on one day spent on two riffles. Most of the video covers how to get there, and the environment itself. Some of the film explains what type of camping equipment, rain gear to bring, and about the film's producers. Part of the video leaves Kokiak, and goes Tarpon fishing in S. America! Guessing from the narrator's hair this video was made in the early 80's. It does not take much to get me interested in watching fishing, but this video just plain sucked. Not worth the time or money."
1,Plastic shoe horns,Tried your product it bent and started to break at heal. Plastic does not make it.
5,Just love it!,"This is the ONLY scent I repeatedly wear! It's not overpowering or too floral, nor is it a wallet buster. Very happy with Neroli Jasmin!!"
4,book review,This book is good forthe starters asit gives all the basic neccesetices of the java prograrmming
1,what a disappointment,took product out of package and tried to open cover which was sticking and cover snapped right off the tiny plastic hinge prongs that the cover swings on. broke the prongs which made the whole unit garbage. plastic hinge is cheesy and is the weak link. never even got to install it. save your money and do not buy.
2,marine cover,"This cover has already broken. It does not open very much. It might have been user error, but now I have nothing, again."
2,Looks great. Poor quality.,Great looking product. Keeps radio dry. Poor construction. Mine only lasted a week. The cover breaks off when you open it.
4,Good general health book for high school,"This book doesn't have answers in the back, but can be used for general health lessons for grades 8 to 10 in homeschooling. The teacher will have to scan each chapter and figure out what questions to ask, or else assign a report over the chapters, but the book has good information."
3,"Glencoe Health, Student Edition","This is a very easy, informative book to use if you want your high school student to learn about how to live a healthy life-style in reagards to healthy living, keep up of hygiene and many other things that are important to healthy living."
1,NOT a textbook for people actually wanting to learn,"This book is only masquerading as a textbook -- it is a propaganda tool for those who want to stick their heads in the sand and not talk honestly about contraception. Check the index for yourself -- ""birth control"" and ""contraception"" are NOT EVEN LISTED. The section on AIDS does NOT MENTION condom use. It is appalling that in this day and age a textbook to be used in health class can leave out science, truth, and a well-rounded discussion of responsible use of contraceptives. This book deserves far less than 1 star."
4,Worthwhile book....just one complaint,"The book delivers many patterns and ideas for needlepoint belts as promised. While I know it's not possible to have ALL of the patterns illustrated with actual needlepoint, it would have been nice to have more than just what is on the front cover."
5,No problem for newbies!,"There is one thing for sure Ann Scott knows her needlepoint. Whether you are new to needlepointing or not this book is incredibly helpful. It's easy to follow, understand, and has a great format. I am eager to start my next belt!"
3,a bit expensive for what you get,"As an avid needlepointer, i was excited to get this book but disappointed when it arrived.The designs are very dated ,early 80's needlepoint designs and are not very attractive.The one good think about the book was the charted alphabets for monograms and international belts are nice.I think ANYONE that is not a beginner will be disappointed with the high price tag and extremely simple designs.Better off spending the money at your local needlepoint store on that belt that would cost the same as this overpriced book."
2,Poor representative of Kantian theoretical philosophy,"Though J. Sallis has proven himself to be an excellent interpreter of the Greeks, the same cannot be said of him with respect to Kant. While this book might be of interest to those curious about Sallis' general philosophical concerns, students of Kant should likely avoid it. The book is completely ignores the tradition of Kant commentary, leaves untouched incredibly important arguments in the Trans. Aesthetic and Analytic, and is written in a flowerly prose that is difficult to take seriously. In short, it is a weak and stereotypical ""continental"" philosophy book. Students should instead read Allison's KTI or Longuenesse's ""Kant and the Capacity to Judge."""
5,Love it,"This DVD is fabulous!! I bought it when I had my first baby and she was using some of the simple signs by the time she was 6 months old - like eat, more, milk.... SO exciting! I think that it is meant more as an instructional for parents, to teach them how to teach babies the signs, as opposed to being made to sit the kids in front of and have them learn directly from the video. It does take time and effort but I really think it is the coolest thing when babies sign back to you - cuts down on crying too!!! Definitely would recommend."
2,Boring!!!,"I was excited when I read babies and toddlers can ""learn over 200 words"". However, my one year old and four year old will not sit through this video long enough to learn anything. It is boring as can be. It is basically one woman standing there in front of the camera teaching sign. Occasionally, she will explain a reason for the sign (mostly for adults), but there is no repeating or recap, which makes it difficult for children to learn. There are no pictures that go with the sign so my one year old loses interest immediately. My four year old will watch for a few minutes, but gets frustrated because by the time she figures out how to do one sign, the instructor has moved on to four more. While it is a very instructional video, it is not at all entertaining, nor geared for children.I was very disappointed with this video."
3,Not suitable for younger children,"We own several Veggie Tales that our children really enjoy. But this particular one is not suitable for small children at all. We thoroughly read the description and reviews for Rack, Shack & Benny and felt comfortable ordering it, but it turned out to be frightening to our young children (Rack, Shack & Benny were threatened to be thrown into a firey furnace if they didn't sing the bunny song). A warning was added to the description after we purchased it."
4,"Early Animation, Still Better on DVD","This being one of the earlier VeggieTales, one should not expect eye popping animation. In fact, even the creators admit that many of the scenes were done in primative fashion and in some places it is very obvious, even without the commentary.The real fun with this show is the music. The ""Bunny Song"" is a very infectious tune (lyrics modified for Veggie Karaoke)and the Silly Song is one of the classics.The DVD extras, although not quite as good as ""Josh and the Big Wall"" are still fun - and the voice flip-flop is fun for kids and adults.Although not the best VeggieTales out there, it still inspires me to keep looking for that elusive all red/face only Bob the Tomato necktie!Most poigniant moment: Jr. Asparagus' mother singing to him in the crib. Funniest moment: ""I think the dwarfs have your mother confused with someone else!"""
5,Brilliant and Entertaining,"My 4 1/2 and 2 1/2 yr olds love this, and I must admit so do I! The songs are great, it's funny and teaches a great lesson. Honestly, it could not have been written better! Brilliant adaptation of the Bible story so that children in our era will understand God's message. So so good."
5,Funny Even Without the Bunny Song,"Veggie Tales star in the story of the Fiery Furnace. Rack, Shack and Benny are faced with a challenge to their faith - bow down to a god other than the God they believe in or die. Our three heroes bravely, albeit a bit hesitantly at first, stand up for what they believe in and get sent to the Fiery Furnace. But their God remembers them just as they remembered Him and intercedes in a majestic way, amid plenty of light and awestruck bystanders. The songs in this movie are catchy and the message is solid - stand up for what is right, no matter the cost. The Silly Songs segment features Larry performaing ""The Dance of the Cucumber"" which is the most hilarious Silly Song ever!!! The translation by Bob the Tomato is guaranteed to leave you laughing as you watch Bob's gradual slide from mildly miffed to all out aggravated at his friend Larry the Cucumber! See this movie - you'll finish it cheered and smiling."
4,"Good, but for older children","This is an excellent re-telling of the Biblical story, but I would recommend it for older children.My four-year-old was terrified of Mr. Nezzer, especially when Rack, Shack, and Benny were thrown into the fiery furnace.As usual, it's an enjoyable Veggie Tale, with some catchy songs, such as ""The Bunny Song."" The song sung by Bob the Tomato's mother is a particularly beautiful song - one of the most beautiful songs on all of the Veggie Tales videos. Kudos to the talented singer!"
3,A weak link in the food chain...mostly annoying,"I appreciate any attempt to get Bible stories out there for public view, but its hard to recognize the original story through the contrived context. Instead of a king, this story uses a boss of a chocolate factory. His underlings (our protagonists) won't bow to his chocolate bunny because they remember what their mom told them. No real mention of God. I had hoped for more from this, because I know the creators can do (and have done) better. Check out ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"" or ""Josh and the Big Wall"" before you get this one. I will admit, the Argentinian ""Song of the Cucumber"" is a stitch."
2,very saccharine,"I think the message here is, no matter what happens God will save you! and it's kinda creepy! I mean, I don't want my kid jumping into a furnace!Some of the songs are funny, but I found it annoying overall. I don't like being bludgeoned with Biblical messages. In fact if I hadn't read the review here I wouldn't have known WHAT Biblical story was being told!!"
1,yuck!,"I can't believe people like these. The animation is awful, the voices and songs are annoying. I couldn't stand my son even watching it and threw it in the garbage. Sesame Street, Teletubbies, Wallace and Gromit, Pee Wee's Playhouse are infinitely better - and at least that way you are exposing your child to good production values."
4,A Veggie Classic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this VeggieTales movie and can understand why it is a favorite for some of my Veggie-loving friends. The plot was good, the characters were lovable (except for Nezzer who of course isn't generally liked, though his singing is fun to imitate). I saw the video version, so I'm not aware of this line-changing business but it does seem kind of sad. I liked the story, liked the characters, liked the silly song too (Larry doing folk dance in spanish is pretty laughable). Highly recommended to any VeggieTales fan that hasn't seen it yet, and actually for those who have. It's one that you can rewatch again and again and still enjoy it."
4,5 Yr Old Loves It,Bought this and the another purse during an Amazon sale. My daughter (5) loves them! They are so easy to take along to play with. Very sturdy with a nice spring mechanism that glides the purse open when she pushes a button.The pieces are very small and easy to lose but it has not been a problem yet. I think the retail price is high on these but my daughter loves them so much I have bought her another lipstick/compact version at full price.
3,"great, but *not* for 4 year olds or under","Once again, a great Veggietales video. At first the ""fib"" is cute, but then GROWS and talks in a pretty ""scary"" voice. This is not for little ones, especially if their little minds have not even been corrupt with the idea of lying yet. My three year old found it at the library, so that's how we ended up seeing it. Luckily his fascination is with ""LarryBoy and his super suction ears and his wings that pop out and he turns into a car and he flys in to outer space."" (exact quote.) Also, the fib's voice (when it's scary), and some others, are very hard to understand. This does not help with the message of the video. I'm returning it, and won't be buying it for a few years."
4,Entertaining and memorable.,"Big Idea Productions, which creates the Veggie Tales videos, has a catchy marketing slogan that goes, ""Sunday morning values with Saturday morning fun,"" and this video embodies that slogan. In LARRY BOY AND THE FIB FROM OUTER SPACE the world is introduced to the 1960's Batman knockoff in the form of crimefighting, well, cucumber. This entertaining video continues the Big Idea trend of increasing production values through more sophistcated textured animation as well as witty, hip dialogue, and memorable tunes. Of especially important note is the Larry Boy theme song. This is a Billboard Top 40 quality song all about, you guessed it, Larry Boy. The video is morally nurishing and fun for kids and adults. Very recommended."
5,I AM THAT HERO,"This is a great video along with the rest of the Veggie Tales videos, I own them all. I think it could be a little scary but our close friend 3 year old loves this and all of them and knows the words to the movies and the songs. There can not be any better of a movie for any kid than one that teaches Christian morals and values! <><"
4,"""Scared Straight"" for the young 'uns","Although it is too intense for most kids under five, ""Larry Boy"" is a valuable moral lesson for kids about the importance of telling the truth. It depicts lying and the consequences of lying in a very creative and effective way. It also has lots of clever and amusing asides for the grownups"
2,Disappointing,"Having seen ""Lyle the Friendly Viking"" and ""King George and the Ducky"", as well as a friend's son's Larry-Mobile toy, I was looking forward to this.Sadly, it wasn't nearly of the caliber of the other videos. Though my four-year-old loved it, my husband and I found it predictable and slow, which we DID not feel about the other Veggie-Tale videos. There are clever moments, but I have no urge to watch Larry-Boy and the Fib from Outer Space again, and, since I don't like my daughter to watch TV alone, she won't be seeing much of it either."
4,drswhittaker,"I love this video! It teaches some very grown-up truths about lying vs. telling the truth at a level that kids can understand and connect with. Entertaining and fun, but with a message that I can relate back to my kids and students over and over again."
4,"Not bad, but not her best.","Having read all of Kat Martin's books that are in print I was very exited when I found this at a used book store. I bought it thinking it would be just as good as her newer ones. I was sort of dissapointed the herion was lacking in some quality I can't quite name, but it's in all her other books. Instead of liking the heroine I found myself getting rather anoyed with her. But it's not a bad book. And anyone who reads this book should not base her writing on it. I just don't know what she was thinking when she wrote this book."
4,Enjoyable read,I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to reading more of this series. I am a Kat Martin fan.
5,The best of his best!,"I fell in love with Paolo through this CD. The best among his albums! The more you listen, the more intersting it gets."
2,Very little of value,"The title and even the author suggest that there is value contained that I did not find. Her main recommendations were to teach children about the thought process, and transcendental meditation. I also thought that the following comments about formal schooling were dissapointing at best:""My view is that we, as a nation, lose out by not beginning public elementary school education in the early childhood years. We lose too many minds, waste too many intelligences. We drain, or fail to develop, the intelligence of our society and of our species.""I read the entire book hoping to find something, but in the end find it hard to even write a review."
4,Great! but has the same design as the 2005 planner ;(,"I love ME's calendars and planners and I buy them every year for everyone in my family and all my friends. But I will say, and this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, the 2006 planner is the SAME EXACT DESIGN as the 2005 planner! I look forward every year for the wide array of drawings and cute images, so I was disappointed this year."
4,Fascinating Glimpse of the Fifties,"In its day, this film was a daring expose of the lives and loves of the white collar ""working girl,"" then still a relative novelty, consigned to the bottom of the professional pecking order. Today, it stands as one of the most telling commentaries of mid-century social relations ever made. A guaranteed eye-opener for those who romanticize the '50s as a time of placid, happy prosperity. I also imagine it will be truly shocking to some of today's feminists, providing the kind of perspective that cannot be learned from a world in which opportunities are much closer to equal."
3,"Great Slice of Nostalgia, but NOT campy!!!","After reading the reviews posted here, I ordered ""The Best of Everything"" with eager anticipation as so many reviewers mentioned the archaic dialogue, gorgeous scenery, and retro sets and costumes. The biggest influenece on my buying this however, was the constant comparison to my all-time favorite movie, ""Valley of the Dolls"". If you purchase this looking for the same campy, kitschy experience you get from VOTD, you will, like me, be very disappointed. This movie was indeed charming and a great look back at how it used to be, but not a camp delight by any means. Just don't expect something else like I did!"
2,"""Valley of the Dolls"" -- without the pills","Despite my comparison, there's nothing campy about this film. But that doesn't make it a particularly /good/ film.Though ""The Best of Everything"" starts off well, as a passable drama, it gradually descends into clichéd melodrama, with foolish women getting involved with men who have only one thing on their minds. (It's surprisingly blunt for a 1959 film.) When the pregnant Diane Baker jumps out of a car to escape her rotten boyfriend, you'll be smiling. Then you'll be laughing at her hospital scene in which she wears the obligatory head bandage to indicate Serious Injuries. And when Suzy Parker falls off a fire escape to her death -- well, there won't be a wet eye in the house. (I was laughing my head off.)Pointless, sentimental tripe. You have been warned."
2,Don't be fooled.,"from an audience point of viewTo the point - Don't be fooled by the cover, Joan's part in this film is only that of a supporting role. The film was ok and so were the three other girls. (Diane Baker had made another film with Joan in 1964 called Strait Jacket in which she had a better part ).Privately Joan lost her husband during this period so she was still in recovery, but that didn't affect her acting, after all she was a real pro."
1,"Trashy, trite","""The Best of Everything"", made in 1959 is just a overly long soap box opera with top notch Hollywood fashions and hairstyles - Suzy Parker, a top model at the time, just cannot act. Her portrayal of a obsessive stalker was pathetic. Louis Jordan played her love interest, and he just did not play the part well either. Joan Crawford was the strong-willed Editor of a publishing company and you felt sorry she had to play such a pathetic part.Overall this is a chick flick gone bad. Three young women's lives (Suzy Parker, Hope Lange, Diane Baxter) are followed as they run in and out of bad relationships in a bad movie.Not the best."
3,The Best of Everything,"I believe this movie ""tries too hard"" by stuffing as many stars as it can into it. Joan Crawford was ""over the top"" in her role. Actually, I was rather disappointed."
2,A little corny..acting poor...but very likable movie,"The characters are very likable in this movie, Stephen Boyd and Hope Lange were excellent. Watching the movie now is almost laughable unless your of an age to remember that women were really like that in the fifties. Very gullible, and excepted sexual harassment as part of the job. There are so many things in this movie that are almost unheard of now...It has a great storyline but reminds you constantly of how far women have come in the working world. The ending when Caroline removes her hat for Mike Rice still makes me feel glad I watched the movie."
5,"A pre-feminist ""Working Girl""","""The Best of Everything"" is a pre-feminist ""Working Girl"". Like the melodramas of Douglas Sirk it's a surprisingly enjoyable piece about women trying to play by the rules, which they don't make, and finding the guys keep breaking them! All the women find themselves having to watch out for the traps set by the men who are invariably married and/or predatory. The closest to a ""hero"" is the office lush, who obviously needs a good upright woman to take him in hand. Joan Crawford looks on sadly, with the bitterness of an ageing Mildred Pierce. Try watching this in a double bill with one of those Doris Day career girl comedies. Hard to believe they were made at the same time!"
5,Classic,"I love this movie even though Joan Crawford overacts. It's definitely been one of my favorites, one I saw as a teenager."
5,Hope Springs Eternal,"A fun picture to watch. I love old films showing big cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco) in the 1950's. I love the sights and the sounds. Anyway, the storyline is ""logical"" (unlike like alot of films shown today) and quite easy to follow. I call it a ""sucker"" film because you will be ""sucked"" in no time and be glad you did. All the ladies were attractive, but of special note for me is Hope Lange. I though she was VERY beautiful and looked outstanding in her outfits (especially the gray/white dress). Sorry to learn that she is no longer with us but if she were I would tell her I thought she was a very beautiful young woman. A perfect film for a Sunday afternoon, a viewer with a heart is required."
1,"""Not That Kinda Girl""",She is not that kind of girl who can sing.This album is so not worth 10 bucks!!!Spent more money on something more better.Suggest:Aly & ajPlay
4,over all good game.,This game is pretty cool. I am 39 years old and have always liked the classic frogger game. still trying to figure out some of the extra games that are on there but I have not had a lot of time to play. All in all a good game and definently worth the money just to get the classic frogger.
2,Uninspired - A total let-down for this fan.,"I wish when bands decide to so completely change their makup and/or style, they would change their name. So many misunderstandings would have been avoided Metallica had renamed themselves to ""Popica"" sometime before their Load album. The same is true of Sepultura and this most recent album.The style of the music is completely different than any other of Sepultura's music. Much lower energy, much less intense, much more meaningless lyrics done by a much less skilled lyricist. More like a few metal fans with a new synthesizer than one of the great metal bands of all time.I think perhaps these guys have promise (but it doesn't show in this album). Get this if you want to check out a new band, but don't expect Sepultura - you won't get it. While many blatant attempts were made to sound like Sepultura, each failed horribly. I can safely say that the true band Sepultura ended on a great note - Sepultura: Roots."
4,please come back max,still really good. I only gave it four stars because I gave roots 5 and roots is better. max left big shoes to fill and derricks gonna have a hard time filling them. honestly I think the band should beg max for forgivness especially igor his own brother.
3,Against is nice but can't compete with other SEP albums,"The new album against is a little bit of a dissapointment for me. There are a few songs that can reach the old SEP's level (against/rezar and hatred aside) but the other songs are a bit dull. The majority of the songs are more Beneath-like than ROOTS. The lyrics are a bit simple, the cd is to short, and the new singer is good but no Max. I should say it is ranked just above Schizophrenia but far below Beneath and the great Arise,Chaos A.D. and Roots. At least they tried something different, but I hope the next CD will be better. Maybe Max will be back by then, I hope so cause Soulfly's Soulfly is great stuff, but would have been even better with the SEP's. Though if you are a real SEP fan, you just have to buy Against, you might like some of the songs."
1,I hate to say it- This Sepulatura CD sucks!,"This Cd says Sepulatura on the cover, but it NOT Sepulatura! Max is gone on this one, but it is not the same, the guy who does the singing needs to learn to play the lead guitar and vocals, I play better!"
2,"Doesn't Sepultura translate as ""dead?""","If so, then it's okay for them to keep the name even though Max is gone. It seems they're flailing for an identity. Come on, Andreas has been doing this for quite some time, where's his songwriting skill? As for the new singer, his vocal presentation is decent, but the lyrics are rather drab. While I think this is a clear display of independence and perseverance at all costs, I am simply not impressed by this work. The instrumental pieces are creative, but the variety of styles, especially the punk/hardcore direction, startled me a little bit. But give them time. I'm very interested in seeing what they do on the next release... then we can better determine what they're working towards. In the meantime, this one will sit on the shelf while my Soulfly CD will be played again and again and again and again... Yes it's true, MAX IS KING!!!!!"
2,The new singer doesn't fit,"Wiht MAx gone, all was gone. But SEPULTURA showed they are brave and goes on with a new singer, Derrick, and tried to find new gorund for their metal, without adding to old formulas or trying to copy Max. The result was not good..."
3,Ehh... okay.,"Decient album, good seplatura style.Except its not really seplatura without Maxx.Its like having a pantera without Phil, or a guns n roses without axel.just doesnt work for me.Of course, thats only my opinion.If you want good seplatura go for Roots, Chaos AD, or Arise."
1,THIS [is terrible] BRING BACK MAX.,This was the first Sepultura cd I got and when I first heard it I thought it was [worthless]. I thought that Sepultra would be a lot cooler.Until one day my friend had some older Sepultura and I didn't think I would like it but when I heard Max's voice it was awesome.So now all the Sepultra music is going down hill without Max but I am still a fan of them.As long as Max is the singer.SO IF THE WAS THE FIRST ALBUM YOU HEAR FROM SEPULTURA YOU WILL THINK THEY [are no good] BUT THEY REALLY DON'T SO GO LOOK FOR THE SEPULTURA CDS CALLED ARISE or BENEATH THE REMAINS.THOSE ARE THE BEST SEPULTURA CDS I HAVE EVER HEARD.ROOTS IS PRETTY COOL TO.
5,Their second-best release,"This is extreme, hardcore metal Sepultura. Next to Chaos A.D., this is their best album, and a nice departure from ""Roots"", which was all sludgy and Korn-sounding and had few standout tracks. The first eight songs on this album are excellent; after that, the band start to lose some focus in the running order but the songs are still all good, especially the combo of ""Drowned Out"" and ""Hatred Aside"". An excellent overall album, I hope their next one comes soon!"
3,Decent...but just not the same...Max was wayyyyy better...,"This album was 'ok'...any metal fan looking into Sepultura shouldn't even THINK of buying this album first...the older sepultura was much better...Chaos A.D. being the best album, in my opinion. I don't like Derrick's vocals...they don't have the same south american growls that Max has. I can't say I'm disappointed, because I really wasn't expecting much more than this with Max gone."
1,please bring max back,"I have been a sepultura fan since morbid visions. I can not believe what happened to this album. there previous album roots was so good. I do not like derrick green. The lyrics are not so good, and the drums and the bass and everything is not great at all. It has seem that the music has turned into pop metal."
2,The worst effort from Sepultura,"Sepultura's first album after the departure of vocalist/founder Max Cavalera, ""Against"" debuts the band with new frontman Derrick Green, and sadly this is an album which suffers from uneven songwriting from an unfocused band. ""Roots"" was where Max seemed to probably be heading the band for a more mainstream appeal, and ""Against"" spits back at him and his Soulfly outfit in every which way, and while it does have a few great moments here and there (""Choke"", ""Tribus""), the rest of ""Against"" is practically uninspired sounding and just sounds so generic. Green was, and is, a good fit for the band; lending some ferocious roars here and there, and thankfully Sepultura molded together better on the following albums ""Nation"" (which was the last studio album for Roadrunner) and the recent ""Roorback"". All in all, ""Against"" is the worst album to bear the Sepultura name, but thankfully things would get better."
2,Disappointing,"After listening to this CD I feel that Sepultura should get on their knees and beg Max's forgiveness. Perhaps for a regular band this CD is OK, but compared to previous Sepultura albums this one is a disappointment. The music is OK, but reading the lyrics really ruined it for me. This new singer just doesn't have anything to say. If you're considering this CD, I would strongly recommend Soulfly or Sepultura: Roots instead. Also, it is worth mentioning that Max did not quit Sepultura, he was kicked out."
2,"NO CHANCE, PAL !","No chance, pal, that you'll like this Cd if you're a Sepultura fan. The new singer, Derrick, is worst than Max ( if this is possible!) and the band suffered a reverse they may never completely recover from. I hope they do, because metal in BRAZIL is almost forgotten forever (in terms of shows and bands making their living on it - there is market only to buy import records). In this CD, they tried something new, maybe for the sakeof fans not say that the new singer is trying to copy Max. Long Live Sepultura!"
1,this is just sad,I lost all hope in Sepultura when this album came out. They lost Max thanks to Andreas Kisser and replaced him with Derrick Green who is just a laughable replacement. There's nothing good about this album. And every album since then SUCKS. Its now 2011 and they still suck. Why would you ever replace Max with someone who sounds like this. Just SAD....
3,"3,5 STARS",This album continues where roots finishes. It has some good song (i liked very much against) bust most of them are very average. i can say that its just ok - there is no relation with the previous masterpieces like chaos ad and arise- beneath the remains. if you likes roots there is a big chance that you will probably like this alum .
2,Against,"Against being Sepultura's 7th studio album and their 1998 release and is their first release with their lead singer Derrick Green. The sound is a mix between alternative metal, groove metal and hardcore punk. There are several problems with this release. The new singer is not nearly as good as their prior singer Max Cavalera. The original sound that was Sepultura is pretty much gone and this is more an alternative punk rock release then the trash metal sound that dominated Sepultura's earlier releases. I have nothing against a band experimenting with their sound. However poor vocal skills on behalf Derrick Green kills this album. Allmusic gave the album 3/5 which is tad to high in my opinion. Since I can not give it 2.5 it gets 2/5. 2/5."
2,Another one bites the dust.....,"It was never 'trendy' to be metal, and everyone seems to be jumping ship, but how did the 'Beneath The Remains' lads end up doing this? Roots was a fine and successful experiment, but this continuation of that sound, without Max, is just plain boring. Get the aforementioned plus Arise and Choas.I'd rather listen to Motley...no scrub that!"
5,HEAVY & AGGRESSIVE AS HELL,"THIS CD F***ING RULES!! I DON'T CARE WHAT ANY OF THE MAX DIEHARDS SAY ABOUT IT BEING JUST AN ORDINARY BAND WITHOUT HIM. SEPULTURA STILL KICKS MAJOR ASS. JUST LISTEN TO THE FIRST F-ING SONG AND YOU WILL HEAR HOW BAD-ASS THEY STILL ARE. THE SONG ""HATRED ASIDE"" WITH JASON N. FROM METALLICA ON VOX IS THE BEST SONG OF THE YEAR, PERIOD."
1,BAD Sepultura! BAD! Now go sit in the corner and think about what you've done!,"Are they even trying anymore? Come on, even the cover art is bad Photoshop.I don't mind Derrick Green's vocals as much as everyone else seems to, they are just as angry and aggressive as Max's. It's the music that just isn't resonating with me the way it used to. The opening track kicks, but after that, it's flat out boring.The only remotely interesting parts of this album, aside from the first track, are when they break out the tribal drums and rhythms. I wouldn't call this a total loss, but it's pretty close. Definitely not worth full price. Buy the song Against, and do like I do and pretend the rest doesn't exist."
5,One of the Year's Best,"What an amazing CD! From the full attack of ""Against"",""Foe"" and ""Floaters in mud"" this CD is a lesson of how well a band can perform with their backs Against (pun intended) the wall. The cd also features amazing instrumentals like the moving ""Kamaitachi"" and ""Tribus"" showing off Igor's talents. Derrick brings alot of new styles to Seps assualt check out the middle of ""Rumors"" and Boycott! The man can sing throw in a ""Hatred Aside"" featuring Jason Newstead on vocals and the haunting ""T3rcermillennium"" and you can't go wrong. By the way why did the Top Reviewer mention Derrick Green's being black Who Cares the man can sing that's all that matters! The two best new bands have black singers Sevendust and Stuck Mojo."
3,What's the difference?,"The guitar on these albums by Sep are really great, I love the intesity...but the yelling aka singing sucks. I don't see why everyone is so mad that Max left, the new yeller is no different from him..."
2,Oh boy..this is what happens without Max.,"I rushed out and got this CD the minute the store got it in. About 2 hours later I wished I could take it back. Max was the true creative force in Sepultura , any of you fans wanting to hear real good music should get Soufly's album."
2,Uhmmmm.....this is Sepultura?,"Dude, this isn't the same. Max WAS Sepultura. This new dude is not crunchy enough. Besides, it doesn't seem quite the same that the Cavalera brothers are broken up now."
4,Good - but Soulfly is better,"I bought the new Album about ten days ago and had to listen to the CD at once - and was a little confused, because Sepultura doesn't continue the Roots-way I loved, but instead return (sometimes) to faster playing of the old days (I don't like the fast style). But then I realized that it is still Sepultura I'm listening to. Songs like Joke or Kamaitachi (my favourite) are ""unforgetable"". ""Against"" is a good album, but Soulfly's Soulfly is still Nr.1 for me."
4,"D. Green is no Max, because he's not","For those who complain that Derrick Green is no Max Cavalera, you're right. Derrick Green is Derrick Green. I feel he does an excellent vocal job on Against. If Igor, Andreas, and Paulo had gone out and found a guy who could sing like Max, it'd be disappointing to say the least. The idea of surviving without Max Cavalera is to replace him with someone who is NOT Max Cavalera"
5,SEPULTURA IS BACK,"Sepultura was not just Max , IGOR , PAULO AND ANDREAS WERE ALSO PART OF IT , so all the die hard Max fans should buy soulfly , which is him doing his own thing , and the REAL sepultura fans can buy AGAINST , which in my humble opinion , is the real deal . Rolling stone voted Soulfly one of the best metal bands , but they also included Metallica , and that just sucks , I mean Load and Reload were huge disappointments . SEPULTURA RULES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VIVA O BRASIL CAMBADA DE VIADO , PAU NO CÚ DA CBF !"
1,if you are looking for sepultura this is not them,I HAVE BEEN A SEPULTURA FAN NOW FOR 3 YEARS AND ONLY OWN 4 OF THEIR ALBUMS I HAVE TO SAY AS A FAN OF SEPULTURA I WAS DISAPOINTED WHEN MAX LEFT AS I WAS DISAPOINTED WHEN I HEARD SEPULTURA'S NEW ALBUM AGAINST. IF YOU JUST STARTED LISTENING TO THEM OR HAVE BEEN A FAN YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO BUY THIS ALBUM AT ALL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FOR A GREAT ALBUM GET ROOTS OR CHAOS A.D.TRUST ME YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED.
1,I MISS MAX!!!,"I bought this album because Sepultura has never made a horrible album and i said how much can one person make a difference. Max made a huge difference, the lyrics on this album stink, the vocals sound like sh*t. This new singer is a let down, not to mention the whole album. They shouldn't even be called Sepultura anymore."
3,Not the Sepultura I used to like so much,"Ever since Max left, this band has become just a mess. The new singer has no passion in his voice and just can't sing. It is definetly not the same. I'll admit, Against and Choke are good songs, but the rest lacks anything creative. If you are new to Sepultura, don't buy this, buy Roots or Arise. Or buy Max's new band, Soulfly."
1,ABC's are for Kindergarteners,"Unfortunately, this book is little more than a glossary of writing terms. Under ""S"" you'll find ""scene"" and ""subplot"" and ""setting"". Not exciting, not inspiring.A much better bet is Josip Novakovich's ""Writing Fiction Step by Step""."
1,Shallow,"After reading the tile, on would think that the entire video would be about this subject. It is not. It starts out okay but after 20 minutes or it wanders off on other subjets, then wanders back. A pretty amateurish job for the most part."
3,"Turn these into films for ""Masterpiece.""","I have read the first three stories and they are excellent.Truly. This is true writing, true storytelling.The House of Cobwebs and The Capitalist shouldbe adated by the BBC right away,they would win awards, they are that good."
2,Sloppy packing ruined book jacket,"I was hoping to have a nice ""coffee table"" book when I choose this book. I was very disappointed when it arrived and the packing was done so poorly that the book jacket was extensively torn. The book is in good shape and I can still use it but it will have to stay on the shelf."
4,Still on my ``A'' list . . .,". . . after two years, not bad. The hooks and the dreamy nature of the music keep it up on the top shelf. Perfect West Coast pop."
2,Style over substance,"...and the Dandies would be the first to tell you. They know deep down they're not very good. But I'll give 'em credit, they've got lots of style. All riffs, no songs."
2,"Aww, Im going to feel bad for this..","I bought this CD because my friend told me to. Call it peer pressure I guess.. I like the CD especially, ""Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth"" but the rest of the CD just isn't.. as good. That song is the reason I bought it, and the CD just doesn't live up to it's potential."
4,Pretty Good CD,"While lacking the musical depth and lyrical expansiveness of 13 Tales, it's still a darn good listen..."
4,A Great Debut Album From A Band With Great Potential,"The Dandy Warhols are one of the best bands ever to emerge from the Portland area. Being a native, I've noticed that the local hype about the awesome group is phenomenal. Being a neighbor of the former drummer, Erik Hedford, I've also had the opportunity to meet the band members while shooting the video for ""Boys Better,"" a truly fabulous song. Overall, I suggest this album, or at least the single CD ""Not if you were the last junkie on Earth."""
5,Amazing Quality Work,"A great performance, specially te alto and chorus. Perhaps the best DVD of the B mass available. Also superb technical quality of the recording."
5,uplifting and serene,"an uplifting work, setting,sound and video all combine to make this a totally delicious musical ofering"
3,Unfortunate copy of a good book,"Yes, this is an excellent book full of useful information on Ephesians but the copy I received is old with yellow pages that are practically falling out."
5,great for small group study,This guide was great for a small group bible study on the book of Ephesians. Provided insight on history and reference to other scripture.
3,not very durable,bought 2 of these for offshore boat. careful installing them because if you place too much stress on the straps they may rip the anchoring points at the bag. adequate design but could be built better.
1,Tore at the seam the second time out!!! What a waste of money!!,After having this on my boat for only 2 trips out the rear seam tore and almost lost my life vest. I would not recommend this to anyone due to how poorly made it is. I only wish I would have paid attention to other reviews!!!! What a waste of money!!!!!!
4,nice bag,"Great bag, I recommend it, I do have one suggestion for the manufacture the extra Velcro straps are not long enough for a 2 inch t top and there should be 4 of them instead of two...however great product for the money..."
2,Didnt fit right,"this designed for a t-top w canvas roof where there is framework at the ""ceiling""with my fiberglass top it did not fit well"
4,Tbag,"Great space saver! Could be about 3 inches bigger, but managed to squeeze 6 life jackets in the main compartment and lots of other items in the smaller compartments."
3,The end of an era.,"""Back it Up"" is an overlooked item in the rich catalog of Robin Trower-The last recordings of the dynamic duo of the Stratomaster and his foil, the late James Dewar. The Scottish-born singer's vocal style, equal parts growl and purr, is as much a part of the Trower sound as the vibrato and liquid tone of the guitarist, one of the few artists from that era still creating worthwhile and vibrant music. Despite the perky (not a word associated with RT) title track, the remarkable ""Benny Dancer"" and the fine instrumental ""Islands,"" there is a feeling that it was indeed time to move on with this record. It isn't a bad listen,and is one that the faithful should have in their collection. We would never hear from Dewar again, and had to wait more than a decade for Trower to struggle through the 80s and early 90s factory of processed cheese to come out the other end, only to create his best work since the golden age with his last three recordings. And he still slays in concert."
2,This Is Not Remastered .....,"For those of you used to ""downloading"" onto an ""I-pod"" you probably won't notice the poor audio quality. If you are used to audiophile CD remastering (A Tale Untold - remastered set) the sound on this recording is awful. It sounds distant and muffled. I bought Jeff' Beck's Japanese remaster of ""Rough and Ready"" - a brilliant remastering job. This CD sounded like I was listening to it with my ears stuffed with cotton. I believe the other BGO Trower recordings have been remastered. I advise all of you to buy only those .........."
5,Another Masterpiece!,"This disc is well overdue! Robin Trower is one of the best guitarists in the past 30 years. But the real un-sung hero on most of his recordings is vocalist and sometimes bassist James Dewar. His final album with Trower is another gem. He ranks with some of the more well known vocalists such as Paul Rodgers, Ian Gillan and Jack Bruce. He's surely missed in the music world to this day."
5,10 Stars for Benny Dancer,"I have listened to Benny Dancer many times now to make sure it is as amazing as I thought it was the first time I heard it. IT IS! To put it simply, the guitar solos Robin plays on this song are some of the best I have heard in my 40 years of listening to rock! The solo he plays at the end of the song is over 4 minutes of amazing brilliance!There aren't enough supertatives in the English language to describe how good this song is. Very tasty bass and drum playing on it as well.For anyone that loves great guitar playing this CD isn't highly recommended - IT IS A MUST!!"
1,Disappointing,"This DVD is an amateurish slide show of a small collection of images without even a soundtrack. A very poor way to view the work of Bob Carlos Clarke. Even the extras are silent slides, his biography is but a few slides with text on screen. No audio at all. There is no video, no interviews, no insights into the man's work. I could have done better with scans from a book knocked out of quicktime on my Mac. His books might be rare and expensive at the moment but you are better off putting you r money into his work in print."
5,We use this toy daily!,"I was really unsure about this toy when we received it as a gift for my 6 month old son, but he loves it. The push thing on top is too hard for him to push himself but that does not stop him from loving this toy. He kicks it, rolls it on the ground and shakes it to get the balls to move on the inside. He also has another toy that is similar that he can push down and he still prefers this one. It is great when we were teaching him to sit up because we could put it between his legs and it gave him motivation to continue to sit. It's durable and can go anyway which is a big plus. Overall it's a great toy!"
4,Fun top for an 8 month old,"This is a fun toy for our daughter. At 8 months she struggles to push down on the top, but she loves to watch it go. She also likes to try to push it. The duration of the spin is perfect. Long enough to hold her attention, but not so long to be annoying. The colors are also wonderful. They have this toy at our library and it's a HIT."
4,Butterfly Spinner,I got this for my daughter at 3 months. I worked out great with tummy time. She is 7 months now and still enjoys it. She can't do it on her own yet but she likes watching/helping Mommy do it.
5,This is...,A very fun and sturdy toy! It reminds me of the olds spinning tops of yesteryear I used to play with :)
2,Attractive but hard to play with,"My 10-month-old always wants to play with this toy as soon as I pull it out of the toybox, but she has a hard time actually getting it to do anything that interests her. She's figured out that you have to depress the plunger to get the little balls to roll, but the plunger is too stiff for her so they barely move. It's almost as good to just shake it and make the balls roll that way. But we have better rattling toys, so she usually lets this one roll away and plays with something else. Like another reviewer, I love that it's a self-contained toy. Unfortunately, it's also loud and bulky, so even though I had hoped it would be a good toy to take on outings, it's just not practical. I still have hope that she might enjoy it more in a few months. If not, it's going on the donation pile."
1,Not sized right,"I ordered an xtra large for my boxer mix to be on the safe side. I even took the measuring tape to my dog to insure that it would fit. I got it and could barely get the legs on, the velcro wouldn't reach to fasten, and I couldn't even attempt to get the hood on. They should make these in XXL and XXXL. I didn't think my dog was necessarily HUGE so I thought for sure the XL would fit. These costumes run EXTREMELY small :/"
3,Bosch 13108 Oxygen Sensor,"[ASIN:B000BZI13C Bosch 13108 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment]]Received with broken box and connection of the sensor. Spend extra money to replace the connection. Final prise cost a double price of the sensor. Package must be properly secured from damages."
3,"As with the previous novel, engrossing-in a world of its","Having read Cooper's first novel, I find he quickly ensnares us in his dream-like world. While the telling of at least four sub-plots at once is interesting, it is also slightly tiring to follow, and not all the stories are equally engrossing. He always manages to tie up the pieces at the end and it is like a balancing act to try to guess how it will happen. I like his style immensely but wish he would stick to one story with more focus. Both AMNESIA and DELIRIUM are deeply, and uniquely felt and one feels like the reading of them is like submerging into a highly intelligent, if somewhat depressed state of mind. Looking forward to the next in the series."
1,Really disappointing,"Feel compelled to comment on the bloody-mindedness of the misguided poser who wrote this book. Amnesia was exceptional, beautiful, profound, original...I mean, there is no other exploration to my knowledge of the ""incorporation,"" in the sense of taking into the body, of an understanding of the Holocaust. Delirium on the other hand, is about trendy lauding of architecture. And about rape (as opposed to desire). A girl's wispy body is the terrain for masculinist puffery or, as I've heard elsewhere about the phenomenon in general, the EDIFICE COMPLEX. Poor Dennis. Had made such a good start. Waylaid by perfpoets,perhaps."
1,Drivel,"I was unable to finish. The author let loose a storm of words and abandoned them. Before I put the book down, at page 77, I felt myself becoming ill. To what purpose Cooper was striving, I haven't a clue, nor am I the least bit curious. Where his previous book, Amnesia, triumphed, Delerium has failed. A huge disapointment."
1,Very old techniques,"Unfortunately Mr. Gould is teaching tennis methods on this DVD that have been completely debunked over the past 5 years. All the top tennis academies now teach the Oscar Wegner method of an open stance, not running with the racquet back, and moving naturally to the ball. All professional tennis players also use the Wegner method and not the Gould method. I strongly discourage any parent from using this DVD to teach their children the modern game of tennis."
4,ok trucker game,from the images i saw it looked great and fun but the first mission is hard and i still got to find how to get passed it but other than that trucker game
1,Worst Racing Game Ever!,"Not only is this game severely limited and restricted in terms of gameplay but the huge clumsly trucks are hardly the best kind of vehicles to be racing in.King Of Route 66 is one of the most linear, non-interactive games I have ever played. The racing locations are lifeless, the trucks are cumbersome and hard to control, you only get to choose between 3 different trucks to begin with, there's way too much repetition and zero excitement.Racing games, by their very nature, are kind of limited in what is possible but this is the worst. Get GTA: Vice City and play that. It's everything a game about cars/trucks/vehicles of any kind should be. Leave this drek alone."
4,This is one Bad ... Trucker.,"It looks to be like 18 Wheeler, which was one of the [worst] racing games I had ever played. So if someone says to me do you want to play The King of Route 66, I'll smile and say ... no."
4,A Riveting Account,"As with most Ken Burns works, The Dust Bowl did not disappoint. The photographs are astonishing, and people who lived through this as children recall the terrible time as if it was yesterday. Educational and dramatic, Dust Bowl is also a cautionary tale for our times. A must-see."
5,"""The Dust Bowl""","""The Dust Bowl"" is yet another teriffic film by Ken Burns! We sat mesmerized through the first two hours and than watched the remaining two hours the next evening."
4,The Dust Bowl,Very informative! The content of the documentary was compact and engrossing. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in The Dust Bowl years.
1,WTF amazon you cheapskate jerks,"This is a 5 minute trailer for the show that amazon charges $2 for ($3 if in HD) - total jerk move, don't get fooled. My own mistake for not checking more closely but still, please!"
1,Boring and ugly,"This documentary consists mostly of contemporary interviews with historians and people who lived through the Dust Bowl. While informative, this film was poorly made and very boring."
4,Dust Bowl Video Brings Back Early Memories,"Born in Kansas and married a Pampa TX girl. Now in our late 70's. We were very young in the late 30's but do have memories and the film brought it all back. Very well done, especially about the Woody Guthrie area. To bad Pampa TX refuses to acknowledge this talented man."
5,Excellent history lesson,Excellent footage and accurate coverage of the trials and hardship these poor people endured. I think Ken did a wonderful job with this film. I would recommend this to anyone that would like to learn about this particular era.
4,The Dust Bowl by Ken Burns,The Dust Bowl by Ken Burns is a factualpart of our national history. It should be required in high school American History.
5,Ken Burns At His Best,"Archival footage, compelling narrative, and interviews with survivors----not reenactors as with most of the History Channel offerings. Popular history at its best. If you are wondering how to make a four hour documentary about dust storms, it is not about the storms, but the people who lived on the southern plains in the 1930s, and the people who live there today."
4,DUST BOWL HD,Hd THE DUST BOWLvery good narating pictures were great. The lord had to have mercy on those people !!!
3,Dust Bowl Revisited,"I feel this treatise on the dust bowl was drawn out. It did accomplish making me feel I was in the dust bowl...thank goodness it was only 4 hours. The repetition of photos, people's comments, and footage was unnecessary--I feel this presentation could be tightened up to two hours given the footage and photos available. Shorter good make it a great film; as it is, I found I became quite bored."
2,Bad DVD,The DVD hangs up between segments. I'll have to return it. Sorry! I tried on three different players. Can you help me?BuynakGRB@aol.com
2,You'll be sorry,"First, I present my credentials: I've seen and enjoyed a lot of Ken Burns's work, probably more than you have. Have you seen, e.g., his Huey Long? The Congress? Brooklyn Bridge? OK, now you know I'm a Ken Burns fan. This production, however, isso repetitive you wonder if he's paid by the length. If it was edited down to 30 minutes or so it would be first rate. As it is, unless you're choking on your own political correctness you'll have to admit to yourself and your friendsthat you were squirming through most of it."
4,A mighty change,"I am almost 60 years old and I have been overweight for almost half my life. I gave up on diets because I would struggle through a diet and then gain back my weight plus more after the dieting. I also suffer from pain in my knees due to arthritis. A friend let me borrow her copy of the book and as I read it, it just spoke to me. It wasn't about dieting. It wasn't about not eating or eating things I didn't like. It was about making educated choices while shopping, while cooking, and while eating. I found the book easy to understand and apply to my life. Within one week of eliminating white flour and sugar from my diet, my pain was reduced and my energy and attitude were on the positive side of the scale. I believe I will lose weight as I continue to eat healthier but as for now, I am glad to feel better. Because of the things I have learned from this book my eating lifestyle will never be the same."
5,Dee's Mighty Muffins is good golfing snack.,"Instead of a power bar try Dee's Mighty Muffins as a golfing snack and also take them as travel food. Store in hotel refrigerator. No mystery ingredients, lots of variations, and it's fresh. Love all the turkey recipes. Even was amazed at the pumpkin pie with tofu as a good no-sugar substitute for my favorite Thanksgiving treat. Used the nut paste for the pastry which turned out a bit crunchy so use the top rack. The yogurt frozen fruit bars are a favorite with my daughter. Stevia took some searching to find and is a good natural sugar substitute without being a carcinogen. Substituted soy milk and found it worked well. There are some staple recipes in this book that made it worth the price. Next I'm trying the chocolate desert. Vicki"
5,Great recipes,"This cookbook has wonderful and easy recipes to try. The ones that I've tried so far have been very tasty and easy to prepare. The nice thing is that you are not giving up sugar and flour totally, just using healthier substitutes. The beginning of the book has Dee's history of her journey through weight loss. You won't be disappointed with this cookbook!"
4,Hits and Rare recordings from the Capitol vaults,"The versatile Ferlin Husky has recorded since the late 40's. This cd has some early sides from when ferlin was known as ""Terry Preston"" which includes an early recording of ""Gone"". The 1956 hit version is also included here. As a collector I enjoy the mix of hits and album cuts and early rarities. This collection is a must for Husky fans. Ferlin Husky deserves to be in the Country Music Hall of Fame."
5,5 Stars Because It's Ferlin,"Ferlin Husky always seemed unique to me when it came to country music. And he had a way about him that said he wasn't just some unsophisticated hillbilly. I think that comes through on his album filler here,""Stormy Weather"", not your average country song. This package also has ""A Fallen Star"" that is absolutely as good as ""Gone"" but did not click as well, perhaps because Grand Ole Opry star Jimmy Newman had his own version out at the same time. Ferlin also does a good turn on the old country standard ""Detour"". I recommend this one highly."
2,Waste of Money: Get the Llewellyn Complete,"Don't waste $25 on a partial edition --- spend $30 for Llewellyn's complete ""Three Books of Occult Philosophy,"" which is also a much better edition, with good annotations. This edition, like just about everything from Kessinger, is essentially a xerox copy bound in thin cardstock. Agrippa's book is the great masterpiece of its kind from the early 16th century; modern practitioners as well as intellectual historians may find it somewhat impenetrable. As an historical resource and compendium of magical material, the work is unparalleled. I suspect that many modern practitioners will find it annoying that Agrippa gives essentially no practical examples. For the linguistically adept, there is an excellent Latin critical edition from E.J. Brill, edited by V. Perrone Compagni. If you want to understand the book from a non-practical perspective, my _The Language of Demons and Angels_ is now out."
3,A treasure - lore of old,"This heavy volume gives an amazing insight into the role of pre-modern-era science, or occult concepts. Much praise must go to the editor who must have a personal library the size of ancient Alexandria to have compiled the much needed notes throughout the work. The appendices are excellent and have great value in themselves. An essential reference book for all who are captivated by magical lore, but if anyone reads this all the way through without suffering one headache or case of eye strain, they have my sincere respect."
4,Interesting,"I found this book to be interesting but a little difficult to comprehend. It being difficult is natural, considering when it was written and then later translated into English. Overall I enjoyed the book. But I think that the book is not for everyone. You have to be really interested in this type of subject matter."
2,Not what was expected,It seems a lot of different editions of this book were published with varying tables of contents or I only have one book and not three. Not very practical and vaguely despriptive. However it has lots of information on astrology.
4,"Sennheiser MX 90 - Good sound, stays put, great price","I wanted good-sounding earbuds that would stay in my ear without constant adjusting, so I picked the MX 90.The price/performance of these earbuds is really great: about $25 for very good sound. They stay locked in your ear too, even when jogging or mowing the lawn. Good external noise reduction as well, with several fitments to suit different ear types. The volume is just loud enough, though it's nice to have an in-line volume control too.On the negative side, the sound response is a bit flat in the upper end. Bass is good, midrange is neutral and clear, though not as clear as more expensive in-ear units (like the Shure E3). The rather long cord gets tangled quite easily, and after multiple uses it gets twisted up.Bottom line: if you're looking for good quality sound that will stay fixed in your ear while walking about, you can't go wrong with these headphones."
5,Delightful story for all ages,"Only one adjective can describe ""Josh and the Big Wall"" - DELIGHTFUL! This video delighted everyone from my junior in high school to my 5th and 6th grade students. What a wonderful way to get the message that we must follow God's word even though we may not understand why at first."
5,Great!,"I can't say anything bad about Veggietales, all episodes are funny, loaded with educational values, what more can you ask for? I own thirteen tapes and I can't wait to get the Jonah movie, great movie! If you've seen the movie and have NOT seem this episode, buy it! You wont be sorry! IT'S SOOO FUNNY!!!"
4,Josh and the Big Wall,"This was given as a Christmas present and the children thoroughly enjoyed it, along with some of the other veggie tales DVD's that were given to theme. Highly recommend it."
4,everyone likes it,"The whole family enjoys watching it. The kids (5 & 7 year old boys) don't ask to watch it over and over, but when I pull it out after awhile has passed, they are excited to see it. I'm not sure they are learning any spiritual truths from the video, but it is good clean fun."
1,How much can violence be sanitized?,I worry so that religious people are living a Veggie Tales version of faith rather than knowing the truly violent and bloody and arbitrarily vicious account in the bible...would a loving father want babies slaughtered? What a cost for obedience!
2,Very entertaining but leaves me confused,"I have to admit that this video is very entertaining and well done... but there is one thing that bothers me. Is it OK to make such a serious and bloody event into something this light-hearted? I mean after the walls fall, there is nobody in the town and the Isrealites just walk through it. In real life there was a violent and bloody raid! Everybody behind the wall was slaughtered! This came about because of following God's intructions?! Were the people (including children) living there not part of the creation that God supposedly loves? Obviously it would be innappropriate to show the truth to children, but then why bother showing a watered-down version that supposedly teaches morals? Somehow something seems very wrong with this. But perhaps that is what's wrong with war-mongering western christians these days."
2,Not so much...,"I have very thick African American, natural hair. This did NOTHING to straighten my hair. I ended up with a big poufy mess."
2,It actually TANGLED my hair more,Oh how I wanted to love this product. Instead the rotating combs manage to tangle my hair more than normal. It works a bit better without it. It also get's good heat although not too hot. I was not too impress with it's overall performance.
5,Hpd47,Love it !!! It works great doesn't break my hair but straightens it . It does a great job. I will buy this product again.
2,Didn't work for me,"Read good reviews, but I have thick curly hair that I blow dry and flat iron. This product did not work at all at straightening my hair, its not even a good blow dryer."
3,Hard to use,The concept is a good one. The dryer is cumbersome. The cord is long but somewhat heavy. I have curly hair. It takes a lot of work and time to straighten the hair without it getting big. Women with curly hair will understand what I mean.
5,Love love love this hair dryer,"It's very convenient to dry your hair while straighten it too. This hair dryer is very easy to use, and makes a better result than hair straightener alone.The only flaw is y hair is little fuzzy after using it,I guess I have to use some leave-on conditioner or some other hair product with it."
1,Not for me,"The product does its job of straightening and shine, but I am thinking of returning this product. I lost lot of hair in the first use and am scared of using it any more. I have thin, long wavy-curly hair, May be its just my hair type, but just wanted to let you all know."
2,not that great,"I really wanted to like this product. I found it very cumbersome to work with. I think it is much easier to use a regular blow dryer and a round brush. Besides that, you still do not get that sleek look with out running a flat iron through your hair. The blow dryer is very heavy and if you have thick or long hair, your arms will get tired before you are done. Nice concept, but does not live up to the hype."
4,A better blow dryer,"I love this dryer - I have long, fine, wavy hair that becomes extremely frizzy in the summer. Using this dryer, my hair has the bounce I get after getting a professional blowout, it's amazing! The only drawback is that it is difficult to use on the ends of my hair, and I haven't gotten the hang of doing my bangs like it shows in the book. The dryer works quickly and really does leave my color treated hair shiny and healthy looking."
3,Better results with a round brush & dryer,My hair is extra curly (corkscrew curls) and coarse. I tried this product and it left my hair pretty frizzy. I still had to flat iron my hair afterwards. I get better results with a round brush and my regular 1875 watt dryer - flat ironing is usually optional when I use these.
1,Major Disappointment,"I couldn't wait for this dryer to arrive. However, when it did, I not only found it cumbersome to use, but it burnt my hair. I have thick, color treated hair which tends to frizz, and after using this dryer just once, I noticed my hair broke off. I shipped the appliance back to Conair promptly. If you decide to try it, proceed with caution."
1,Not as Advertised,"The commercial makes this product look easy to use, but it wasn't. It was extremely awkward. The barrel is too short, and it's difficult to pull your hair through the comb attachment and hold it there - there's only high and low heat and the high will burn your fingers. I'm happy for those of you who like it - but I returned mine for a full refund."
1,Not as accommadating as I thought,"I do not have use of one hand, so I thought this product was the miracle product I was looking for. Unfortunately, it cannot be used with only one hand. Hair must be held in one hand while the other works the dryer. Damn!"
2,Unnecessary for straight hair,"If you have slightly wavy or straight hair, the cost and complexity of this hair dryer are not necessary. I did a test and my hair looked the exact same when I turned my head upside down and blew it dry in less than five minutes and when I painstakingly used the comb attachment and blew it dry in sections for an hour. Guess I'm lucky, so I'm returning this for a cheaper, simpler dryer."
5,Love this hairdryer!,"I have naturally curly hair that has gotten curlier as I have gotten older. I prefer to wear it straight, and this dryer does the trick. It's easy to use and my hair looks great when I'm done. There's no need to use a brush. You hold out a section of hair with one hand, and run the dryer down it from root to tip (repeat a few times). What's left is straighter, shinier hair. It's fast, too. I've cut down my drying time in half since I got this dryer. I also like the fact that it's small, travels well, and fits nicely in my bathroom drawer. It's hot enough and powerful enough to give you the results you are looking for. I definitely recommend this dryer to anyone with naturally curly hair who wants to wear it straight. Great product!"
3,blow dryer,"the dryer was hard to use and I still needed to use flat iron, but my hair dried a lot faster than usual. Mal"
4,Awesome Hair Dryer,I bought this blow dryer right after Christmas this year and I have yet to be disappointed. I have curly hair and it does a nice drop blow drying without making it too frizzy. If you are wanting a completely straight look then you might want to use a hair straightner like a chi.
3,"""Not as straight as I thought""","The straightening attachment was a little disappointing. However, the heat produced by the dryer is phenomenal, so much so, that it makes it difficult to hold the hair in place so that it can be straightened properly. The dryer in conjunction with the concentrator attachment works wonderfully. So I rated it 3 stars because I hoping for better results from the straightener."
2,Not good.,"Good for straightening, but the curling did not work. all it did was fry my hair. It only curls short hair, and I have long hair. Dissapointing."
4,Wonderful Break through,The hair dryer was what I expected and more. I enjoy the end result and happy I found something for my thick hair that works with detangling.
2,Not what I expected...,"When I purchased this product, I thought I would get a lot more for my money. I was disappointed because the results weren't like the ones on the infomercials. I have thick wavy hair, and it wasn't a good straigtener. I still had to run my cheap iron through it and that worked even better! DON""T EXPECT MIRACLES!! Plus, its kinda loud and it gets very hot against my neck. Trust a flat iron instead!!!"
1,Not worth it.,"I have short/medium length curly hair. I thought this device would save me time and energy. It turned out that the prongs on this device didn't even catch in my hair, no matter what setting/level I put it on. In the end, after trying to futz with it for over an hour, I ended up having to still use my older hair dryer to blow dry my hair and flat iron. I returned this item right away for a full refund."
2,This stinks!,This hair dryer is the worst. I'm not a fan of ionic dryers but I thought I would give this a try. It looked great on tv. The piece on the end that's supposed to grab your hair doesn't. It's the most important feature and it doesn't work properly. It left my hair frizzy and overdry. My Wet 2 Straight flat iron by Remington does a much better job and leaves my hair soft and silky. Not the case here. Don't waste your money! I'm giving it a 2 because you can still use it as a regular dryer without the attachment.
2,Waste of money!!!,Still have to use your straighten iron...doubles the time it takes to straightn your hair.left my hair frizzy.Don't waste your money!
3,it does the job.,"I bought thisone like four years ago, the attachment would constantly fall out. But i solved that problem by supergluing it on. It works great it does, but after a while since i put some product on my hair, this yucky gunk would stay on the white part of the brush and was stuck deep inside. And it was really hard to clean out. I also think it made my hair frizzier. I tried the Vidal Sassoon one with the brush attatchment, and while it overheats it left my hair way smoother. The REALLY great thing about this one, is that it doesnt overheat. at all, after four years."
5,It really works!,"I have worn my hair curly for many years because I am inept with a blowdryer and round brush and didn't want to damage my hair with a flat iron. I was ready for a change and decided to try this. I am amazed at how easy it is. One pass through the hair and it is dry and straight, but not limp. I need a little practice to get the ends to flip out, but I'm sure I'll get there. The dryer is pretty light and easy to manage."
3,"good dryer, not a straightener","As a hair dryer, this works great. The diffuser dries my hair really fast. The straightening attachment gets my hair straighter than it is (it is naturally very wavy) but I still definately need to use a straight iron. It cuts down my overall time for doing my hair, but not the amount of gadgets needed. I blow dry, straighten, then curl under the ends. Used to take an hour, this dryer did it in half an hour. However, the issue of heat is real. The air gets REALLY hot & since you're using your free hand to guide your hair, it can burn your fingers or neck & your hair gets really hot. I guess that's why it works so fast, but it hurts so be careful."
1,"Product is good, but the support is terrible!",I bought this product for a friend who lives in Malaysia. I didn't know that this product would not have the support for 220V/240V sockets (like their other products do). I contacted their support and asked if there is anything that could be done (change to a new product or anything). They NEVER responded! Some companies just want to sell and make money. They don't care about their customers at all.
2,OK But don't expect miracles!,"I have long, thick, wavy hair and am always looking for ways to tame it as quickly and effectively as possible. I was hoping this would help but I sent it back within a week. The temp. of this dryer is EXTREMELY hot and it is very cumbersome to use. After ""straightening/drying"" my hair for 30 minutes I ended up with a burned neck, a sore hand and wrist, and fuzzy hair. I tried again over the next few days but I never found a way to achieve silky straight hair. So, for now I am back to using my regular hair dryer and my large barrel round brush. 20 minutes later my arms are sore but at least my hair looks great! This product is simply not a miracle worker."
2,Not what I was expecting,There is no difference between this product and a regular hair dryer.It didn't straighten my hair at all.
2,Not for me!,"I purchase this product thinking that it would work for me since I have normal hair, not curly, or straight, but somewhat wavy, my point is that my hair is manageable. The air is not as hot as other dryers on the same price range. If you are looking for something that would help you finish your style faster, this is the product for you, but bury in mind that the results would be disappointing unless you have naturally straight hair. My suggestion is to go for a normal dryer. But if you decide to go ahead and buy it, I wish you good luck."
1,save your money....,"Its not really that fantastic, actually its faster and easy to dry your hair with a conventional driyer. It burns your hair."
1,Worthless. Stick with the flat iron.,I do not like this product AT ALL. It is too bulky and awkward to use. A regular flat iron works much faster.
4,My hair is moderately wavy,"My hair does not easily straighten, but is not the most difficult. This dryer is much better than using a regular dryer and hairbrush to straighten the hair. It drys the hair fast. However, for a more sleek look after drying, I need to spray on some shine and then use a flat iron. I'm glad I bought this dryer."
2,Difficult to use,"While I enjoy the benefits of having a diffuser-type of blow dryer, I was disappointed in the ease of operation of the straightening/anti-frizz attachment. It's pretty cumbersome and I'm not sure it is any better than just using a round, alumnimum-based brush. In fact, if you are already using a round brush to take the frizz out of your hair I would recommend that you stick to that method. This type of attachment was just too difficult and ineffective for me to use.I still enjoy the quality of Conair's products but I am sorry I spent the extra bucks for this one. I could have purchased a much-cheaper Conair dryer with a simple diffuser."
1,dissapointed,"This hair dryer is not easy to use. The directions are not clear or helpful. I have shoulder length hair and have not been able to insert my hair properly in the tooth brush attachment. My hair is medium to fine which should make it very easy to use with this gadget. It simply does not work. It looks easy on TV commercial, but is not in reality. This was a waste of money"
1,Good for long hair only,"If the length of your hair is medium or short, this blow dryer is useless. Do not buy it thinking that you have the option of returning it if you do not like it. Unfortunately the only way to get the blow dryer out of its packaging is by breaking the plastic casing."
2,Conair disappointment,"I love Conair and is the only product I buy when it comes to hair products. Blowdryers, brushes etc, but the Conair 208 Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer is a true disappointment . Not easy to use and I have more frizz in my hair than ever. I still have to use my flat iron after I use the dryer. I am sorry I threw the box out otherwise I would have return it."
5,love this hair dryer!,"I bought this hair dryer originally at a department store. When my sister entered college she decided to steal my hair dryer. I basically purchased another one off amazon for myself. It doesn't damage my hair, is within a decent price range, and my sister and I both love it."
5,Love this blow dryer!,"I have pretty long hair, and bought this for my sister who has shorter hair now, thinking it was better for her. Silly me, this blow dryer is great for all hair lengths and types! My family is a great mixer and our hair comes in every beautifully full type, to thinnnn thin baby type. But it makes blow drying a breeeeze for us all, with the built in brush, which i also initially under estimated, it makes the process so much quicker and easier! And the price was reasonable."
2,Not As Good As I Thought,"I purchased this item as a replacement to 3 other blow dryers I own. My hair is medium to coarse and very curly. I tried straightening a small strand of my hair for about 3 minutes and it did what it promised, however I felt that it took too long and it was not as straight as I wanted."
4,Wonderful,"This does work wonders... It cuts drying time in half and leaves your hair shiny and soft. However, you might still need to use a flat iron to touch up some spots."
4,good dryer,"This product is a good dryer, but the staightening function is not as good as I expected. It does not work well with my hair type. I think it should be good for thicker and wavier hair, mine is very thin."
2,Not Good for Everyone,"I have medium length somewhat curly hair, layered on the top and sides, and I bought this item after seeing it on TV and looking at it on this site. Unfortunately, I'm less than impressed. I think it might work better if you have long hair, or hair that's pretty much all the same length, but it doesn't really work for me the way it's intended. The hair dryer itself is good, I like it, but when I put the attachment on it, it doesn't cut it. I watched the DVD several times, but I'm still not able to get it to do what it shows in the DVD. If it wasn't such a pain to box it up and send it back, not to mention costly with the return shipping, I'd do just that. Instead I'll keep it for the hair dryer or find a friend with longer hair."
5,Fantastic product....like magic!,"I bought this product yesterday and am thrilled. I have very wavy, thick hair that tends to frizz and get big by the end of the day. It's the end of the day and my hair is as smooth and shiny as after I dried it this morning. I'm looking forward to using it again! It dried my hair much faster than any dryer I've ever used and totally pulled out the wave. I'm sure as I work with it it'll only get easier to use. It is a bit bulky, but once you get a hang of how to angle it there's no problem using it. For anyone who gets frustrated with a straightener and just wants to dry and go, this is great. It also came with a short DVD explaining how to use it. Worth every penny!"
5,Really Cool Product,"I have very thick, very curly hair and nothing has really helped straighten it except for a permanent straightener. This hair dryer is now my best friend! I have Multiple Sclerosis which causes my one hand to act up so trying to have a dryer in one hand and a brush in another can be quite the pain - this helps for this as well."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!!!,"I have never written an online review before, but I was so disgusted by this product I would love to save someone else the headache.What it is: just another hair dryer with a stupid attachment that doesn't even go thru your hair, let alone straighten it.What it isn't: an easy way to achieve salon straight blown out hair style.Bottom line: I guess if people who do not have naturally straight hair (like me -- thick and wavy/frizzy) want straight hair, we will have to get it the old fashioned way...hair salon blow-out, or home blow out with a good hot iron to finish it.Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with this piece of junk."
3,one length hair verses razor cut layers,the hair dryer is not as easy as you think to use especially when you have different layers I think it is better meant for long layers or one length hair
3,Arrived very fast,"If you are like me & can't seem to hold a brush while blow drying you're hair without making a big frizzy mess b4 ur arms get tired & u just give up, these kinds of blowers are for you. I only gave it 3 stars bc the picture leads you to believe that it comes with more parts than it actually does. I recived a bower, 1 attachment that looks like the comd, 1 concentrator & 1 DVD that I didn't even know was in the box bc it's hidden with instructional pamphlets. The venders pic shows a brush, two comb like attachments, the concentrator, DVD & blower, that's why I picked this one over another vender that sold this blower cheaper. This blower says it was made in 2007, I say that bc, I'd like to know what year things are made b4 I get them."
1,Disappointed,"I've tried many different hair dryers (I have thin, curly hair) and some work well, but this one was very disappointing. It looks cute and modern, but it does not straighten the hair as it ""promises"". Not at all. One more time I read great reviews and was expecting a nice product, and...not again. I don't know if I should not trust the reviews or if I am just not very lucky. If your hair is wavy, curly and you want to straighten it with a hair dryer, this is definetely NOT the one."
1,Too Heavy,I found this dryer to be so heavy and bulky that it was very difficult to use. I definately wouldn't buy it again.
2,Not good for Black peoples hair,"I am a Black woman and I bought this thinking it would help me get my daughters natural hair a little straighter and more manageable. It did NOT!!! it took much longer to dry her thick natural hair and her hair did not flow smoothly through the attachments. It doesnt get hot at all, more like high warm at it's highest setting. Those of us with natural hair know that when we are drying higher heat helps make the hair more manageable, even though your hair looses moisture with high heat Black people have to moisturize our hair so vigorously either way that it's worth it since the moisture get replaced daily through cremes and treatments. I even used this to dry me hair weave and it didn't work well on that either. And that was Indian hair! lol. I dont think this product well unless you have fine hair. I ended up getting an anndis blow dryer with a comb attachment"
2,Waste of time and money,"It works just as well as a hairdryer and round brush so its not worth getting. It didn't save me any time, it was awkward, heavy and expensive. I watched the instructional DVD and read the instructions to make sure I was using it properly. I was still dissatisfied. I returned it and invested in a good quality straightening iron instead (the Conair Infiniti straightening iron works great!)"
1,Very disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. I have very curly hair. This product pulled out my curls but DID NOT straighten them. My hair was poofy and frizzy. A brush and a blow dryer or a straightening iron do a much, much better job. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. They need to go back to the drawing board and improve the design of this machine."
3,Don't expect miracles,"I have really straight, fine hair that sometimes flips under and so I thought this blow dryer would be the best. It works for tough flips and makes them more manageable, but the strength of the blow dryer blows my hair out of the holding mechanism even when it's at it's highest tension. This makes it really hard to use the attachment in your hair.Even when having my sister try and use the attachment in my hair, it doesn't seem to work as well as it could. The angles are sometimes awkward - and the attachments can rotate - but they are so hot during use that you can't touch them.Regardless, the attachment is a nice feature to try and use when you really have a bad hair day, and the blow dryer itself (without the attachment) is of a very high quality and drys my hair faster than a regular blow dryer."
5,Great Book!,I loved this book. I think it was really good. I just got caught up in the story with the Baby-Sitters Club.
1,Disapointed,"Very Disapointing, this is 55 minutes re hashed from their previous dvd! Fine if you dont have the first one"
3,"Correct Position, but Not a Good Presentation","This author has written a great book on the same topic, ""The Kingdom of the Beast,"" which I would highly recommend. This book was a dissapointment.Although the author takes a correct position on the rapture: post trib and pre wrath, the book fails to live up to its claim to be a simplified presentation of the second coming. The author jumps around from topic to topic, assuming that the reader understands all the assumptions that the author is basing his comments on. Unless the reader is thorougly familiar with the issues surrounding a discussion of echatology, he is likely to become confused trying to follow the discussion.I would recommend this book only to people who have already read dozens of other books on the rapture and second coming, and who have first read ""Kingdom of the Beast"" first. This book is definitely NOT the only book one needs on the topic!"
3,A change that wasn't really a change,"In retrospect, we now know that Alice and the band were having musical differences around this time. Alice wanted to be more theatrical. The band wanted to be a rock band again. Seems the band won out on this album, but ended up proving Alice was right. Muscle of Love is really a return to more of the straightforward rock of albums like Love It To Death and School's Out. If you think Crazy Little Child is an ""experiment,"" go listen to Blue Turk on School's Out. This is not a BAD album, but it's not a GREAT one, and suffers most from just having to follow Billion Dollar Babies. If you just want the highlights of The Coop's catalog you can skip this one, but you might be missing something reasonably good in the process."
2,"The weakest of the classic ""Alice Cooper"" period","When I was a kid, I loved Alice Cooper. This was my least favorite album (I am not even addressing post ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" since, by then, the whole dynamic for the artist had changed).Now, when looking at this from a historical vantage point, it is very easy to see why this the weakest album. The group strayed away from what made them great...playing stripped down, hard rock and they varied their music too much. This was a talented band but they were no Beatles and did not qualify to venture out too far from what made them successful.The best songs ""Muscle of Love"" and ""Big Apple Dreamin"" work because it sounds like the ""Alice Cooper"" band. These are hard hitting, gritty rock songs. ""Teenage Lament"" was okay (interesting singers doing back up) and the rest just sound too far removed from what made the band good.Experimentation and creativity may be positive but, you shouldn't mess with success."
2,All GREAT Things Come to an End,"Not counting the first two Coop albums Pretties For You and Easy Action, this is by far the weakest release from the original AC Band. With that being said, it does contain one of the BEST AC's SONG OF ALL TIME: Teenage Lament '74, so go figure.There is one main reason why this album is a letdown as compared to all the previous ones: BOB EZRIN IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. If Bob Ezrin worked with the AC Group on this album, it would have no doubt been much better. Just look at Alice's next release for proof."
5,IIF ROCK could only be HALF AS GOOD AS THIS now!!!!!!!,This CD ROCKS! VERY UNDER RATED and a VERY FUN RELEASE.I guess you had to be there when it came out.PLAY IT LOUD! I'm sorry...but ALICE pretty much bit the dust(in my eyes anyway) when the ORIGINAL Band broke up.Except for the SPECIAL FORCES LP/CD...No other (Alice) band could ever capture that early magic.
3,NEVER SOLD BERORE... MAY NEVER BE HEARD AGAIN,"After six incredible albums, and years as one of the biggest touring acts in the world as rock superstars, the original Alice Cooper lineup begins to show signs of wear and tear. This album is fair, but does not stand up to anything released prior to it (including the obscure psychedelic freak music on Bizarre/Straight records.) The massive success of BILLION $ BABIES, with its not-so- heavy sound, could not be duplicated by a band who simply wanted to rock as a band-- not as a backup for a solo act-- so the rift between leader and followers resulted in the band members getting canned and the release of the leader's ""solo"" project WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE, which was a far better album."
3,Average Cooper Album but some gems on it,"Probably the most underrated Cooper album and he still is with the original band. 4 of the 9 custs:""Never Been Sold Before"", ""Hard Hearted Alice(just for the cool intro)"", ""Working Up A Sweat"", and the title cut all work because they are let loose rockers. I don't know what it is but I like the opener ""Big Apple Dreaming(Hippo)"" for its steady gove and let loose chorus. The other 4 well, 3 but I never really cared for ""Teenage Lament '74"" fall flat with a thud but at least you get those 5 other tracks. ""Crazy Little Child"" has a jazzy feel to it but just goes on for far too long and it not that good to begin with. Its no where near Alice's worst and its worth it for Cooper fans but don't expect another Killer or Love It To Death."
5,Under Rated!,"This is a brilliant album. Right up there with all the best ACB albums. Ignore the nay sayers, it is great!"
3,Some good stuff and some mediocrity as well,"The last album by the original Alice Cooper-band is a mixed bag of affairs.The hits ""Teenage Lament"" and ""Muscle Of Love"" are great, as is the underrated rock n' roll gem ""Workin' Up A Sweat"", and ""Hard Hearted Alice"" and the slightly Zeppelin-like ""Big Apple Dreamin'"" work pretty well also, but to be honest, the rest is filler. Not horrible filler, just regular filler. But filler all the same.That goes for hundreds of highly praised rock records, obviously, and many bands would have been proud to call this album their finest work, but it doesn't live up to the brilliance of ""Killer"" or ""Billion Dollar Babies"", although it certainly does have its moments. And serious fans should buy it just for ""Workin' Up A Sweat"", actually. That one doesn't show up on any of Alice Cooper's many compilations (with the exception of the Rhino box set ""The Life And Crimes Of Alice Cooper""), and it is most definitely worth a listen."
3,not bad,A friend of mine bought this years ago when it first cames out. Not bad... it takes me back to the good old days again.
3,This is an acoustic set - 3.5 stars,This is basicly acoustic material from the Jamaica born Detroit bluesman. I've heard more electric material from this artist but the unplugged style suits him well. It may not make one forget Robert Johnson but it's a pretty good disc and fans of acoustic blues will want to search this one out.
2,Broke after using for 1 week.,"Gave 1 star for working as it should. When i was able to use it, it was great! Easily my favorite stapler in the world because of how easy it staples. I work in accounting so i'm having to staple papers all day and night. My only gripe about this product (and reason i gave it a low score) was after only a week of using this stapler and feeling like Milton from Office Space, the spring that holds the staples in place somehow came off and i couldn't figure out how to re-connect it. I could not find any information on their website, instruction manual, nor was i able to get any assistance from their customer service about this issue or a replacement. Oh well... it was good while it lasted, but i don't think i will try again because it was kind of expensive to start with and only lasted me 1 week without me doing anything but try to load more staples. :("
5,Doesn't create cactus needles,"This stapler shapes the staple to fold smoothly without poking through like a cactus needle for a wide variety of paper stack sizes. Sometimes when I use my other heavy duty stapler with fewer sheets than the correct stack size for the loaded staples, the staple pokes through the other side creating a sharp needle. The designers of this stapler got the folding dynamics right!"
5,Very easy to staple stacks of paper,"It does what it says it does...staple 65 +- sheets of paper. The upper arm is easily pressed down and when it reaches a certain point, an internal spring drives the staple through the paper. The stapler body is made out of metal and it feels like it'll last for years.It may not drive the heavy-duty staples or handle as many pages as myStanley Bostitch Extra Heavy Duty Stapler, but I rarely need to staple more than the 65 sheet capacity of this one. And it's a lot easier to use.Highly Recommended"
3,"Works, but Awkward","The instructions (yes, I read instructions) advise to turn the stapler away from yourself as a safety measure. In other words, turn it away in case staples shoot out of it and impale you.The stapler works well, and I haven't had problems with it popping or shooting any staples, but turning it away makes it harder to use. Two fingers? Ouch is all I can say. It's a little wobbly, too.I must say, I approach the electric stapler in the office with a skeptical eye, because it's even more powerful, and I don't want to be disabled by staples. This stapler works very well, but not with ease as described. That is, if you turn it away from you like you should. If you're shopping for a heavy-duty-ish stapler, shop for price."
5,This is a great heavy-duty stapler,"Particularly if it's coming out of the office budget, I highly recommend this stapler for anyone who does a lot of stapling or who regularly needs to staple large documents. While I use the palm of my hand, the stapler does most of the work.The package does include 1000 high-capacity staples, but it should be noted that only half are 65-sheet capacity. The other half are for up to 30 sheets, according to the box.This stapler does also accommodate ""standard"" staples, but since they're shorter will not hold a big document securely.Because of the power of this stapler, someone who isn't very strong could hurt themselves playing with this, and I would not keep it around a home office if children--even those not so small--are around. It is dangerous."
1,owner,This was the worst product we ever ordered. The staples stuck together or jammed up. A total mess. We had to return the product.
5,WORST STAPLER,"It does not live to the advertised claim of stapling up to 65 pages...the staples frequently jams up...very dissapointed ,,,felt cheated"
5,It works like it says!,"Can you ask for any more than that? It is advertised to staple 65 sheets at once, and it does. It's easy. It's durable. I've had no problems with it - no jams. Amazon has a great product at a competitive price. Can you ask for anything than a product that works as advertised at a good price? I think not. You won't be disappointed."
5,This is one fine stapler,"For years, I have been frustrated using the same, run of the mill stapler. Every time I would staple something thicker than 10 sheets, I would get bent staples that wouldn't completely make it through. When I got this stapler, the first thing I did was 50 sheets together and it worked perfectly. It needs very little effort to press it down and none of the stacks I have had to staple together have had bent staples yet. My only problem with this stapler, and it is not much of a problem, is that you need non-standard staples to get through the 65 sheets. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this stapler to anyone."
5,Light touch is all you need,This is by far the best desk stapler I have ever had. It's easy to load and easy to use. You just have to give it the lightest of touches and it staples multiple pages easily. I haven't had to test the 65 page promise on any heavy paper but I did manage to staple well over 300 glossy magazine pages together with no more effort than 2 sheets would of been. Great size too so it shouldn't need refilling often.I really would consider this more like a piece of office equipment than the usual off the shelf staplers I have had before and yet for a home stapler this is going to get a lot of use!
1,Not what I expected,"Just so you know, this is NOT The Job TV series with Denis Leary. It's an urban comedy movie with the same name"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"I was looking forward to Dennis Leary in TV series ""The JOB"" but what I got was some Urban Comedy with the same title.I am VERY DISAPPINTED. A total waste of my money!"
1,The Job,"Like other Amazon customers, I was 'steered' to this purchase as a 'related item'...related to DENIS LEARY. And of course, it has nothing to do with Leary. I hope the people who made this movie are not stroking themselves for any sales they have made; I am sure every sale occurred the same way- someone like me said, geez, they finally put out a DVD of that great Denis Leary show! I loved that show! I want this DVD..........NOT!!!!!!!I also hope someone tells Denis Leary he better hurry up and put out a DVD and title it: ""The Job: THE REAL THING""."
5,truthful words in music,"I think this cd is wonderful. I feel it had a lot to offer young people, as an insight into real life. I especially liked song 9. I would recommend this cd to anyone."
4,Empowering!,"Though this is a true story, it reads like fiction. In Ruby's Wish, Shirin Yim Bridges tells the story of a bright and independent little girl growing up in a house of 100 children. But, this little girl stands out in a crowd and writes a poem about how hard it is to grow up as a girl where boys are privileged. When questioned by her grandfather, the patriarch, she makes her case. And, years later, instead of a little cash in her red envelope on Chinese New Year, she receives a university invitation in her red envelope and becomes one of the first female students to attend. The combination of great watercolor illustrations and the true story of a Chinese woman whose wish came true makes this one a treasure. As you read with a daughter from China, be prepared for some hard conversations about their preference for boys.If you want to read reviews of 35 children's books having to do with China, visit the 7/2/2012 post on myoverthinking(dot)com"
2,Wrong for my computer,"Cannit make it work on any of our computers, even parents couldn't figure it out. Major disappointment where it states it is for our sytem."
4,"Great game, if you can get it to work (Hint, good on Mac)","My 3-now4-yr old daughter loves all these ""Bear and Penguin"" games, but we have gotten thisseries of games to work only on a Mac, NOT on an XP machine as one would thinkfrom the descriptions. If you've got a Mac and can get this cheap, it is a steal. Thegames themselves are very well made."
2,"Mediocre book, TERRIBLE ending.","I've read Grisham's Testament, Firm, Runaway Jury. This one was my fourth book by Grisham and definitely, my last. The character is annoying and empty. The plot is unrealistic. But the ENDING ruined it all. Was Eva killed? Did she run off with the money? Who could have killed her and why would she run with the money after this hard work? Terribly disappointing. I am going back to the store today and I'll get my money back."
3,John Grisham writes a better ending.,"I must say that there are no heroes here. Grisham's earlier books featured clean-cut individuals placed in awkward positions that required difficult decisions and great effort to resolve. By contrast, in this story everyone around has an ethical blindness regards theft and covetousness. Somehow, none of the main characters seems to think that taking fraudulently obtained money is wrong.That said, Grisham has finally begun to write novels that end as well as they begin. Many of his earlier books featured heroes and heroines predictably flying off to a fabulous future with vast sums of money at their disposal. This one has a much better-crafted ending that makes it worthwhile reading it to the end."
2,Not up to Grisham's snuff,"John Grisham knows how to write a mystery. His books _The Client_, _The Runaway Jury_, and _The Street Lawyer_ demonstrate a skill of plot, particularly, throughout his career. His work is a shrine to ""Show, don't tell.""_The Partner_ is an exception. Nearly every detail of the plot is revealed through monologues, the intrigue occuring after the fact. On the upshot, this would translate into a drama with a comfortably low budget and demanding memorization for the actors."
3,Good read some of the time,"I listened to the book on audio because I love Frank Muller's voice and he brings out the best in Grisham's novels. However, even the excellent audio version could not make up for the lousy ending. There were many interesting angles in the novel but I realized that the poor ending was simply a result of an unevenly crafted plot. I like the endings to make sense and this one didn't on many levels. But I'm not giving up on Grisham as I've loved many of his other novels."
4,Fantastic Book,"This is a fantastic book - one of Grisham's best in my opinion.It has all the typical lawyerly stuff, with a twist that the main character has effectively made himself disappear!My only complaint is that the ending left a little to be desired - I am finding that true with many Grisham books - they are excellent, fast paced reads - but often the ending seems like it was abrupt and incomplete.Anyway, if you love Grisham, you will love this book."
3,Grisham cannot write a good ending!!,"Awesome book. One question:Why didn't he tear out the last chapter and throw it away?It had nothing to do with the book, nor was there anything in the book that would indicate an ending like this.This is not a twist, its simply a stupid ending. Grisham reminds me of a salesman who can never close the deal. I was buying through out the whole book. But at the end I walked away from the sale.Runaway Jury - sappy ending Brethren - stupid ending..No more Grisham for this lad!!"
2,Worst. ending. ever.,"99% of the book was a fun page-turner. The ending came out of left field, with nothing in the preceding 362 pages of plot and character development suggesting it could end that way. Just a jarring, grating, train wreck of an ending that spoiled what was otherwise an enjoyable read."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"The Partner, where should i begin, i cant describe what this book is about in 1,000 words but I'll do my best at summarizing it for you. It is about a guy (Patrick) who steals 95 million dollars from his firm and runs for his life. After 5 years of evading the government he is finally caught, however that is just the beginning of the book, This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will not want to stop reading until you have finished. It will keep you guessing from Cover to Cover. It has so many twists and turns and if anyone could predict the ending to this book without someone telling them or reading ahead they are a genius. It is spellbounding and is definetely worth 7 dollars. I hope you found this review useful."
3,"Typical John Grishman, starts strong, ends weak","I don't know why I started reading another John Grishman novel.After the last one I read I vowed not to read another.The book starts of well. The end however is NOT credible. How could a man who planned every detail, anticipate how people would react and circumstances likely to occur, be (1) caught unaware and (2) not have a backup plan.Eva's defection in the end, just dropped out of nowhere.I saw no hints of this."
2,I should have stopped at page 465,"The majority of the reviews are pretty accurate. You do feel like your reading one LONG ending. But I chalk that up to style. It was just different. I don't want to criticize Grisham as this is the first book I have read of his (I'm not a big fiction reader), but something is missing. However, overall it is an okay read....unitl the end that is. The last three pages of the book absolutely ruined it for me. A man (Patrick) who has thought this far ahead and executed as he did throughout would NEVER have been in a position to let something like that happen. It left just too sour a taste in my mouth. All that reading......and 3 pages ruined it!"
1,Not Impressed,"Having read a number of John Grisham books I found that they were all getting a bit samey and I don't even know why I started to read this one.Now that I have read this book I wish I hadn't bothered and actually feel that I wasted the first few days of my holiday in reading it. This book is really quite dire. Whereas all good stories have a beginning, a middle and an end, this story is just a four hundred page long ending. This makes the book quite tiring to read! I only finished reading 'The Partner' because I always finish what I start and I have given it 1 star out of five as I can't give it none."
2,"Bad writing, but I keep on reading","Grisham has now written the same book several times - a woman and man virtually alone against a world (including the FBI) out to get them. Here they are in The Partner. The writing is, as ever, utterly pedestrian. And how many times do we need to be told that someone is drinking coffee? A change this time is the ending, a splendid piece of irony but so out of character with the rest of the book that it can only seem utterly contrived, a dea ex machina (albeit going in a direction opposite to the usual). All of the above notwithstanding, I continue to read just about everything Grisham writes. When I have time to kill, or am ensconced in my chamber, or away from my firm, or with no clients to see, or lacking a partner, then Grisham does have a certain analgesic effect."
4,Good with a bad ending,It was a good book and kept me wanting to read it but the ending was really stupid. John I like your books but why did you do this stupid ending?
3,The Firm II,"Poor John Grisham. He pretty much single-handedly creates agenre, achieves blockbuster status with only his second novel, andevery further effort flies off the bookstore shelves and onto the movie screen. And then, when he writes yet another of his books, everyone bashes him for being boring.^M ^MLike The Firm, this is a novel about a man who is preternaturaly clever at figuring out the details. The protagonist is the same, although the name has been changed. I imagine this is Grisham's response to all those people who must have asked: ""But didn't they come looking?"" There are no surprises if you've read Grisham's other books, and plenty if you haven't. The most distinguishing factor for this book is a strong moral sensibility that hasn't been expressed since A Time To Kill. It isn't art, but it is fast-paced and cleverly plotted, which is why you pick up a Grisham after all."
2,Yet another dissapointing 'blockbuster',"THE PARTNER, in the grand tradition of Danielle Steel, is, yet,another 'cranked out by popular demand' book. I had hoped for a farbetter story than this. The characters seem weak and familiar ( perhaps they are related to RUNAWAY...? ) Although Grisham weaves a semi-clever web and continues in his tradition of killing us with intricate details, he managed to take a marginally interesting idea and turn it into 'just another predictable book'. THE PARTNER was not riveting and I found it so easy to put down to clean the bathroom and wash the windows. I do enjoy the author's descriptive narratives and feel compelled to share that, for the most part, the places his characters visit on the Mississippi Gulf Coast do, indeed, exist. Let's hope the next one won't hit the stands for quite a while."
5,One of Grisham's Best!,"The Partner ranks up there with The Pelican Brief.<I havebeen disappointed in the past couple< of Grisham books, but thisone made me a fan again!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It is Not His Best Book,"It's nost his best book. Runaway Jury is better, but I live inBrazil and he made a great job describing the cities hereperfectly. This book was a little bit predictable, except the end...."
2,A below par effort by Grisham,"Just when I thought Grisham was doing something a bit differentwith The Runaway Jury (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I read The Partnerand was very disappointed. The story lacked the hold that Grisham usually has over his readers."
4,Great airplane book!,Excellent as always. A well thought out plot with an obvious ending. But only obvious once you get to it.
4,Very good!,"I thought this book was very good. Everyone seems to hate the ending but I liked the ending and thought it was VERY creative. The reason I gave it an 8 is because it started out slow. But around 350, I stayed up till 12:30 in the morning and finished it."
3,A burger without the onions!,"A mouthful to be sure. But alas, nary a kick to the palate. John Grisham has forsaken tension for cleverness. This book is actually in reverse, with the climactic scenes at the beginning. But then again, perhaps this is the first draft of the sreenplay for the hit movie starring.....oh I don't know.....maybe....John Grisham? By the way, the two pages outlining the story of Clovis are by far the most entertaining part of the book."
3,Hope for a part 2 to find Eva,When did a cheesy lawyer in a firm become a perfectionist in the art of spying? Where did he get all of the money to run all of the surveliance that he did. Maybe Eva left because her father could have been killed over money.
1,Skip it.,"This may be the weakest of Grisham's books in terms of plot,character development and realism. You never understand theprotagonist. Perhaps that is because this character, like all the others are so flat.For a man who is so meticulous in his planning, plotting and triple checking everything, Grisham reveals that he tells the girl all within two days of meeting her. Why? This relationship is grossly underdeveloped. Grisham mentions several times the ""partner's"" fondest desire is to spend the rest of his life ""reproducing like rabbits"" with the girl. What was the point of those repeated references?Anyway, I haven't read any of the other reviews yet. I didn't want it to influence my own. I've read everything Grisham's written and this is, in my opinion, by far the worst."
2,Evil Triumphs Over Evil: Who Cares?,"An entertaining enough potboiler, but the characters are all sodespicable I found myself hoping they all lost. This book makes oneappreciate how much better the legal suspense genre is currently being written by others, especially Scott Turow."
4,"A page-turner, but not Grisham's best work.","Keeps you interested with the plot twists and legal subtleties, somewhat like The Runaway Jury, but not as exciting. The ending is a bummer"
1,A dismal book saved only by the last page,"I am very disappointed by Grisham's effort here. His writing has become completely droll and predictable. Am I the only person getting tired of the same downtrodden Mississippi lawyers fighting the same corrupt agencies while being completely perfect and omnipotent at the same time. His writing has become a complete bore. The only saving grace in this overly melodramatic sob story was the intriguing ending. My suggestion is that you read the dust jacket and the last ten pages, then go find a classic to convince yourself that good literature is still out there somewhere. Maybe even in Grisham's world"
4,"good, but unsupported ending","As usual, Grisham's book was suspenseful and interesting. Thelegalities were covered niceley and all the subplots ended neatly.However, I felt that the ending was completely unjustified. The twist seemed completely implausible based on the Grisham's narrative throughout the novel. While a plot twist can be surprising, it must be supported. This one was completely unbelievable."
4,John Grisham - The Partner,This was a page turner. I don't read very many books written by men. The ending to this book was very disapointing. You could tell it was written by a man - no romance
2,Grisham should take a break,"I think it's time for Grisham to take a break from writing anddo something else to get recharged. His best work was his first book.The next two were fairly good and different from the first, A Time to Kill. Perhaps if he took a few years off he would come up with an original storyline again. I have read all of his books but I would gladly wait several years for a quality novel."
4,"Good, but not John's best","the Partner, a new John Grisham novel, is about, you guessed it, a young lawyer who steals some money and fakes his own death. But now they put him up for murder along with robbery since they found a hip bone in his car crash rubble. Good book, but not as good as The Firm. Read this one anyway."
2,Good book except the last 2 chapters,"This book had the potential to be one of Grisham's best. After reading the conclusion, however, I had such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't read Grisham again. I won't spoil this for anyone who still wants to read it by explaining why, but let me just say it was a brilliant story with a stupid ending."
3,"Good book, lousy ending!","This is a typical Grisham opus, fast-moving, readable, with many a twist and turn. It held my interest all the way, but I have two fairly major gripes. First, as is common with Grisham (with the notable exception of ""The Rainmaker""), the character development is not all it could be. You don't feel that you really know these folks, and you want to understand their motivations better. But the real drag is the ending, which is incomprehensible, doesn't fit, and leaves you with the firm conviction that you just wasted a day or two. What was he thinking?"
3,i love this book,but the ending is really really bad! I thought eva really love patrick how could she left him just like that it doesnt make sense!
1,The Partner (A novel,I have not received this book. It has been over A month and have not received any word from sender.James Williams
5,Grisham finally gave us something new .,"Another of his book ?? no not just another, this book has a refreshing outlook to what new can grisham get in his writing, probably chamber was his first experiment with something new which did'nt to very well so after a few more of the trash he's come up with this. A masterpiece on it's own i would say, the plots better than all i read so far and i've read all of his works, this book is very well presented as the plot being so confusing could have dissolved in it's own complexity, but this one does'nt . It's very enthralling and gets you hooked on to his writing again, well in my opinion it's a book every grisham fan should read, this time re-reading would not only be interesting but also enlightening. This book restores my faith in Grisham's writing again and i wait for The Street Lawyer with optimism"
4,Hard to put down!,"The Partner is one of Grisham's better novels. It was so unpredictable and compelling .... until the last Chapter. Either Grisham had writer's block or the publisher dictated the length of the book. I spent 3 hours reading up to the end because I needed to see how Lanigan worked his way out of his ordeal. I spent the next 3 hours repeating ""What a dumb ending."" Do yourself a favor and read the book, just skip the last chapter."
3,Good...but,"I love Grisham books, and this one keeps the stile, but it's predictable after the first half and the end sucks."
2,Huge let down!,"Whoa, what happened to the normal fast-paced Grisham fluff? This was one of the most depressing novels I've read in years. I won't be reading any more Grisham, there are too many other authors out there who can entertain more consistently without leaving you in a ditch at the end. The book did have potential, which saves it from getting only one star."
3,Its an okay read when you are bored and dont have any other books around,I finished this book a while ago. The story is interesting but its just streched out too long. How did this guy make all this time to spend so much time with this old person and then to work day and night to set everything up etc?. He must have had 48 hr. days.I did like the ending because i sorta did expected it but on the other side I didnt think this would seriously end like this. So it's okay to read but its not one of my favorite books.
5,Awsome,It was my first John Grisham Novel and now he is my favorite author...I think that says it all about this novel! The only thing I didn't like about this story was the ending. I felt it just didn't reflect the character he portrayed all through the story. But I would still give it a 5 Star because it deserves it! Grisham I just wish you keep coming up with your appealing novels!
1,I want a refund!,"I see that used hardcover versions of this book are being sold for one penny. Save your money! Who wants to read a book without one likable character? Once the story is established, it is a predictable march to the finish line. Oh, I forgot the stupid ironic ending thrown in for good measure. Skip this one and get one of Grisham's better books."
3,"Entertaining but carelessly written, not Grisham's best","Perhaps I am missing something, but it seems to me that aspects of the plot were not well thought through. As we learn early on, Patrick has faked his own death and his wife Trudy has received a large insurance settlement. One of the subplots consists in the idea that Trudy and her boyfriend, Lance, now have a motive for killing Patrick because then Trudy will not have to repay the money to the insurance company. But I don't see how that makes any sense, because everyone knows now that Patrick is alive and, after all, no one has been paying the premiums on the insurance policy.There is also a scene where the father of one of the main characters is described as jogging ""three hundred kilometers"" in what is presumably several minutes (p. 279, hardcover ed.), a further sign that the author was asleep at the switch.This is a fun read while it lasts, but when you get to the end you feel it wasn't really worth it."
5,The most well written mystery I've read so far,"I quite enjoyed reading The Partner; 1) It involved revenge on a law firm for being corrupt, 2) Details were described in full rather than half fast, and 3) there are still question unaswered leaving the reader to use his/her imagination. A definate 5+ and one I'm proud I bought and not have to return to the library!"
3,"Interesting plot,but very predictable","Not the John Grisham of ""Hard To Kill"" and ""Pelican Brief"", never the less a very interesting plot. The ending is given away much too early. I would like to see Mr. Grisham spin a plot around Leah on the run hiding from Michael and/or Sandy"
2,Grisham is now writing only for the money!,"Like Tom Clancy and Harold Robbins before him, there comes a point in some authors life when there is nothing left--Except the calls from the publisher/editor to churn out another book. Grisham obliged with a very mediocre ""The Partner"" in 1996.In 1997, Grisham will do it again. That is to say, write a novel in 6 months and take 6 months off. I really can't say as I blame him. It's the system at fault.""The Partner"" is an okay, easy weekend read and nothing else. The book is okay, but there is not much there.Grisham is destined to be known as just another unimportant 20th century author, in my opinion. A pity after such a strong start with ""The Client."""
3,Tiramisu.,"This book is like dessert for dieters. Anticipated. Sweet. Longed for, even. And then...tiramisu. Yum. Tastes good. But wait -- there's nothing to chew on. No chunks. Some flavor, but mostly air. I had hoped for a nice, dense chocolate cake with layers of flavor, a variety of texture. And a lingering sense of fulfillment. There's nothing wrong with tiramisu -- it just doesn't really count as dessert. Worth eating. And there is nothing wrong with this book, except it just doesn't fill you up. Better have some cookies hanging around"
3,different from any of his other books,"The ""Partner"" left me wondering who was the hero until the the last pages. I was not quite sure I was supposed to want Patrick to get away with everything but found myself on his side even though I didn't know why he had committed this theft. Knowing he had stolen the money from a law firm was in itself a reason to beleive in him.I'll recommend it"
3,I didnt like the ending....,"I read this book with the usual anticipation I have for this author. The ending, however, threw me for a loop. I was quite disappointed in this ""artsy"" ending."
1,The last Grisham book I will ever read,"This is the first Grisham book I have read since The Client. Grisham has definitely not gotten better with age.The plot was initially interesting, but he goes nowhere with it. There are no surprises, the bad guys just give up, and the justice system gladly goes along with whatever Patrick plans.Patrick's relationship with Eva is never explained in detail, and the ending is simply an attempt to put a small measure of surprise and negativity in an otherwise bland and formula driven book."
2,boring!!!,"my first Grisham novel, and probably my last. I read it because it was the no.1 New york Times bestseller. Well, that cannot mask its absurdity of plot, and flimsy charaterization.Why would Patrick lead his hunters to his lovely town four years after he stole 90 million dollars? Is he nuts"
4,Very interesting and readable but...,"it seems that Grisham was aiming this book for the big screen again since he twisted the scenario and plot to the extreme and so evasively by not letting Lanigan clarify the murder case every time when he was asked by whosoever; his old judge friend, his lawyer Sandy...until the final chapters came but just by using a corpse as an easy way out for Lanigan and the writer himself. The final chapter of ultimate betrayal turned out to be very sad yet very illogically put... The dramatic ending was just one of the overdone twists of the plots. Quite fun for trying so hard to grap readers' attention but not a good mean to do so repeatedly often."
5,Here's to a True Grisham !,This book is absolutely the best of Grisham. And I've read them all! The ending has a twist like no other !
3,A usual bestseller,"This book is the typical Grisham book. I usually take about a month to read such a book, but this time it took me 4 days. It's a great page turner, and the suspense is always there. However, the plot isn't that interesting, and the end is kind of weird. Seems to me he finished it quickly 'cause he was behind a deadline..."
3,Hated the ending but loved the story,"Grisham kept you roped in until the final pages when you were left fully disappointed. I wonder if he was planning a sequel to this nove or possibly a movie deal. Those of you who have read the book may agree that the ending was a bit unbelievable. Nonetheless it was a great story, Ijust didn't care for the ending."
2,A great read spoiled by a contrived and illogical ending,"The story was un put-downable, but the ending was so illogical that it completely spoiled the overall enjoyment of the book. I re-read the book looking for clues about the end but there weren't any."
3,Not a bad piece but something just ain't right,"With $90m, wouldn't it be easier to hide in some remote paradise or even hire a small army to protect you ? Besides, would you trust $90m to anyone you met in Brazil ? And, the way it ends, though predictable, is an obvious tail left for a sequel. I read it in a 20 hour plan ride. Not bad but I got that feeling that it's just not all that logical."
4,90 million dollars and nowhere to run!,"One gets the impression from his books that mr Grisham has little respect for the legal profession.Being a qualified member of the ABA perhaps this is no surprise. His latest tale is the story of Patrick Lannigan a junior partner in an unscrupulous Mississippi law firm who runs of with a not insubstantial amount of his company's receipts.During the four years he is on the run Patrick is fully aware a search is out for him and find him they do.Patrick is happy to return and face the music but only under his terms.The rest of the book regales us with the ensuing courtroom drama and legal battles from his ex-wife,the US government and his previous employers hopefully to retrieve the missing money.The author captures our attention from the beginning and never lets go.One of his better efforts I think.The twist at the end was unexpected but inevitable."
2,"A great work, only to be undermined by its ending","I discovered John Grisham about 6 months ago and to date I have read about 8 of his novels. ""The Partner"" was my most recent, and also my last. (""The Appeal"" was almost my last). I never really cared for Grisham's endings, but I put up with them because he's so good. But this book was the last straw. After I finished reading it I felt like I had wasted my time. I felt cheated because of the crappy ending. The only way Grisham can redeem himself in my eyes is if he write a sequel and therefore rights a terrible wrong."
4,"Relax, get a beer and read this one","Picked this one purely cause of the great reviews on Amazon. Like always, Grisham gives you a beautiful break from everyday life.Fast paced, realistic portrayals and seriously cool !A fantastic read for someone who justs wants to put their feet up, relax and savor some great entertainment.Read it!"
5,An excellent novel,"Many people who have written reviews for this book complained about the book's ending. I believe that throughout the novel, Grisham hinted... I found the the end very well done. I also believe us Americans have too much of a tendency to believe life is a fairy tale, and that everything ALWAYS works out fine in the end. It simply isn't that way. So much for the Disney-like endings."
3,"good read, but the ending left a lot to be desired","typical grisham. took a while before you knew what was going on, but he keepsyou wanting more. without spoiling it, the ending was like a patricia cornwellstory - the writer has no idea how to end the book, and pulls a conclusion fromout of left field - leaves you wondering if spending the time to read the bookwas worth it..."
3,Speechless!!!,"If I could rate this book on the first 363 pages it would without a doubt be a 5 star novel. However, the u-turn that Grisham pulls on the last two pages simply ruined it all for me. It was a twist in its worst sense, even lacking sense. With a chapter left I was already planning which Grisham novel I would dive into next. Being finished, I'm not sure if I'll read any more of his novels, the Partner being my fifth. A very unfortunate end to a very promising novel IMO."
4,Another Good Grisham,"This one was very good. My expectations were low for some reason, but I really enjoyed this. I liked the character in the story, but thought that he should have come clean with one of the main events early on in the plot. Overall, a good one."
5,Awsome,"A huge fan of Grisham, I have read many of his books and this one definately caught my eye. It was far from a typical mystery; it kept me interested and made me finish it in two settings. Read this book! You'll get hooked!"
3,"Great story, but the ending left a lot to be desired","John, you're the greatest . . . I just hope there will be a sequel. Eva and Patrick really need to find one another."
4,"A good 460 page story, too bad he made it 467.","If your really into Grisham you may consider this a ho-hum effert. However, the story is intresting and does take some unusual twists. Lanigan is a genius in legal matters but a fool in reading people. I thought Grisham was brilliant in writing such an elabrate scheme. Nonetheless, the ending left something to be desired."
4,Good book!,"This is pretty standard Grisham, but if you like him generally, you'll get a kick out of this book."
1,Lousy ending to a pretty decent read,"Not only did I not like the ending, it just did not fit the character development which preceeded it.Up to that point, the book was quite engaging and a page-turner. But the very last twist was too much - and left me unhappy, wishing that the very unlikely ending had never been pasted into the manuscript."
2,Give me a break,"When an author writes a cop out ending like this they should refund your money for a waste of time. I read a book a week from a variety of authors and have read many of Grisham's books. I've enjoyed all the rest of his books and found them highly intelligent and thought out. In The Partner he makes every indication that the main character's friend Eva is madly in love with him and gives no indication or reason why she leaves him except that he wants that one last shock to the readers/audience. If you are going to end a story like this there should be some clue(s) even if they are so subtle that you have to reread some of the story to find them. Sorry if this ruins the book for anyone, but spend your money on one of his other books."
5,Fantastic!,John Grisham has done it again....capturing his readers heart with 'The Partner'. It was very interesting and quite amusing to me as how Patrick managed to get his way in the end. Get your copy today.....you won't be dissapointed. ; )
4,Not Too Bad..Really,"The book started off great but faltered towards the end. And the incredible...almost genius way Patrick pulled his stunt was quite simply a bit too unbelievable for me.It relied too much on coincidence and good luck. Nevertheless, it was a good read."
2,A very disappointing read.,The author should not assume his readers are not paying attention. He slapped together a silly ending in order to make sure the main character did not get off scott free. This resulted in his not being true to his characters. Tsk tsk Mr. Grisham that was not very nice.
4,"A bit predictable, but still a great Grisham","John Grisham's reputation for a great thriller has not been damaged. This is a great, fast-paced read with a little deception and romance tossed in to give it a well-rounded appeal. I felt the ending was a bit predictable, the foreshadowing was too obvious to leave much question as to how it would end, but still a great story.Patrick is on the run after four years and millions of dollars and is captured and tortured to reveal the location of the money. Once the FBI takes over, Patrick reveals his plan to work his way out of almost everything that comes his way and gets a surprised in the end."
3,"intricate tale, overly clever","Grisham enjoys playing around with the reader's perspective in most of his books. In The Partner, he manipulates to the extreme. At first glance, Patrick is presented as a con-man extrodinaire having bilked $90 million away from his former law firm. As the plot unwinds the reader learns that there were justifications for Patrick's actions. The ending is just another manipulative plot twist that causes the reader to feel he has never really had control of the story. But in a way it is appropriate, after all, the ulltimate con-man has himself been conned. And besides...it was only money he lost, he still has the small brick abode, the shiny red Beetle, and the quiet Brazilian streets. I enjoyed this book but it wasn't as good as some of Grisham's others--The Runaway Jury and Testament. Still, it was lots better than The Chamber."
3,"Great novel, but others are better","I loved this book, it's definitely in my top ten, However this is not Grisham's best work. I personally think that some of Grisham's other novels like the Firm or the Client. Although this novel is great but there are a lot of others out there."
2,Decent. Story line is unrealisticaly perfect. BAD ending,"I've read about 5 John Grisham books in last 2 weeks and I am disappointed with many of them. The plots/stories are quite similar among them. As a result, this book was pretty predictable. Overall it was a relatively good read until the last few pages where Grisham left you high and dry with a bad ending which made you feel like you just wasted 10 hours of your time. Many others will agree."
4,Action packed,A good book that I've read in just 2 days since the story kept moving. There's not one page that was boring. If you like action and suspense this book will keep you in your seat until the end.
5,"Surprizing, Outstanding, Magnificent, Kept me wanting more!!","This was an excellent book I would recomend it to anyone. John Grisham is a very, very good author. He keeps you wanting more, he describes very vividly. Love, Decite, Lies, Lawyers, Cover-Ups, Money, Greed, Dissapearing, Death, Torture. Trust me you wont want to put it down."
4,it was intense reading for a teenage but it was outgtstandin,If read his book in thew past but they were nothing compared to the partner.
2,The Firm revisited,"I have read many of Grisham's books and found this the worst. It was the same general plot as the Firm but with a terrible ending. If his character was smart why didn't he place part of the money in a joint account. He wouldn't have to know where it was and if this girl was so in love with him, why the ending. I wouldn't pay the money to watch it as a movie."
3,"OK book, with a lousy ending","I liked this book better than I thought I would, considering the limited scope of the plot. After all, most of the story takes place with Patrick, the runaway lawyer, in custody. The story takes many unpredictable turns and is, for the most part, plausible. But the ending is disappointing, and somewhat unbelievable given Eva's risk-taking behavior throughout the book. Still worth a look and one of Grisham's better efforts."
2,The First Thirty Pages,"The Partner by John Grisham is non-stop action, for the first thirty pages. The next three hundred pages or so that follow, is nothing more than a man sitting in a hospital bed telling his lawyer how he made it all happen. You see, Patrick Lanigan, the main character was a lawyer at a prominant lawfirm before he stole 90 million dollars from them, faked his own death and was on the run for four years until he was caught. That was the exciting part of this book, the first thirty pages. After you read the first thirty pages put the book down or go on the run for four years yourself because that is how long this book seemed to read."
2,Grisham is laughing all the way to the bank,"The book is predictable, and the ending only serves to acknowledge the failure of Grisham to establish a sensible and believable plot. Once you realize the entire premise of this book hangs by a thread you are forced to contemplate the alternatives, and in doing so reveal the ""twist"" ending to yourself half-way through the book. Grisham wrote one or two decent books early on in his career and his continued success is a tribute to his ability to recycle formulaic plots into stories just original enough for most literate adults. Next time someone tells me to read the ""new"" Grishman book, I'll just say ""No thanks.. I've already read the Firm."""
2,Awful Ending,Great book from start to almost finish. It was such an entertaining read with lots of twists but the ending ruined it. Made it all a waste of time. Grisham's books are usually a lot more satisfying.
2,Bad Ending - says it all...,"For me, a good book/movie has to have a good ending, and by saying a good ending, I don't necessarily mean a lovely ending but I mean an interesting ending, a surprising one or something just purely nice. The ending of this book left me with a very empty feeling that I even have a hard time explaining why. I feel deceived and I feel as if I wasted my time. Therefore, I advise on reading other John Grishm books and not this one."
3,Hated the ending,"I liked the book all the way until the last 5-10 pages. The ending left me totally disappointed..I wanted to yell at Grisham for ruining an otherwise good book with his ending..It took an enjoyable read and soured it quite a bit. The other parts of the book are well thought out and keeps your attention so that was entertaining, but it was ruined for me by the end. and after all the end is your lasting impression of any book. so my lasting impression is one of disappointment.I still think his earlier stuff (A Time to Kill, The Pelican Brief, The Firm and The Client) are his best stuff. If you haven't read any of those (and there are not alot of people who haven't) I highly recommend you purchase those first.And books by Ken Follet are also very good especially (A Dangerous Fortune & Pillars of the Earth)"
4,Easy reading and fun,Standard Grisham fun read while on vacation. Fun to read while sitting on the beach....but it is the Gisham formula.
4,Ending,"the book is very good, i enjoyed reading it. It is one you can not put down. I was hoping for a different ending."
1,Lousy ending.,Not what I expected from John. What a wasted evening that culminated in a 2am disappointment. If you're romantically inclined than please pass on this one. Although I don't want to know the ending I'll be sure to check the ratings on Amazon before I buy another Grisham book.
3,John Grisham's The partner,Not one of his best but still very readable. My wife and I have enjoyed most the John Grisham's writings and will continue buying them.
4,More story would have been nice...,"It's become a fashionable thing to read everything John Grisham puts out; and in that line; the story is not bad. But for a person who has never read Grisham; disappointment with this novel may set in. If we could have had more story; life on the run, how the law firm was swindled, etc., the read would have been a great ride. But for tried and true Grisham fans, the story ranks right up there with ""The Client"" and ""The Firm."" This book was not as memorable as ""A Time To Kill,"" but still thoroughly enjoyable"
2,Where was the climax?,"Where was the climax of the book? Can anyone tell me? It just kind of putt-putted along and then it drops off the chart at the end. Was Grisham trying to put a ""moral to the story"" at the end or what? While my wife and I are sick of the ""guy and girl run off to the Cayman islands"" at the end of most Grisham novels, this ending stunk. In no way did Grisham ever prepare us for the end. If he was going to end it that way, he should have made the ""Pluto Group"" something that Patrick had never heard of. That's what I expected and it had by heart beating a bit harder. But when it didn't happen, he had not laid the groundwork necessary to end the book like he did, in my opinion. Overall, this was the worst Grisham book. ""A Time to Kill"" is my favorite by the way."
4,"Good, but not great Grisham","An enjoyable thriller from Grisham, but very familiar stuff. My personal favcrite of his is The Rainmaker, and this is nowhere near that good. But if you need a good page-turner with some enjoyable twists and turns, this is a good bet. In some ways, this is the flip side of the characters from Runaway Jury, and their clever plot."
2,Grisham needs a new schtick,"Is it just me, or are all Grisham works the same book withdifferent characters? I admit I have not read all of them, howeverthe ones I have read are so similiar that I cannot keep track of which book it is. The female leads of ""The Partner"" and ""The Runaway Jury"" may as well be the same person. Both mysterious, beautiful and holding all the cards. The lead lawyer characters of ""The Firm"" and ""The Partner"" may as well be interchangeable. Grisham needs to lose his ""submit new character name here"" style of writing and prove he can move beyond ""The Firm"" genre with something intelligent, well written and totally original."
3,Disappointing,"I love John Grisham and was very excited to read his newestbook. Unlike his other books, this one didn't grab me from thebeginning. I kept reading it thinking that it would get better. It did, but only a little. The ending was a bitter disappointment. I will read his next book because I know it will have to be better than The Partner. This was not the John Grisham I know and love."
5,VERY Entertaining!!,"I was very entertained throughout this book, though the endingleft a little to be desired (which is true of several other Grishambooks). I was reminded of the Runaway Jury all through this book as his plot revolves around a person who has taken great pains to hide his true identity with the help of a female love interest. I read books to be entertained and this book fit the bill to a ""T""."
2,Longest Grisham book ever!,"Or maybe it only seemed like the longest. In general, I likeGrisham's writing, even loved a few of his earlier works. But Icouldn't help feeling that in this one, he was just trying to meet a deadline. I found I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. They were undeveloped and you just couldn't work up any sympathy for even the main character. I got so bored in the middle that I did something I rarely do - read the last few pages early. Then I scanned through most of the rest. Just didn't care anymore. Sorry Mr. Grisham, maybe you ought to concentrate not on quantity of books but quality!"
2,Nothing special,"I was excited when Grisham put on a new book as he is one of myfavorite authors, but this book did not live up to his usualexpectations. It had no interesting plot turns, and Grisham's usual knack for character development and an interesting plot failed him."
2,Downhill for The Partner,"I was really dissapointed by The Partner. No twist and turns,no surprises and a unlogical ending. To bad. I really liked, TheRainmaker, The Jury and The Firm. But this one was not at all up to his usual standard. By: Peter Carlsson, Sweden"
3,Grisham's books are begining to sound the same!,"Grisham is now, ""beating his horse to death"" bywriting the same topic over and over, if you've read one of his booksyou've read them all. I can only compare his writings to other great's such as Danille Steele, who have hit on a good format and can turn out their books as if they were popcorn. Of course these author's are making a great deal of money making popcorn. As long as the public buys, go for it!"
4,"Great story, magnificent detail. Who is Patrick Lanigan?",I enjoyed this book very much and find I would like to read more about Patrick Lanigan's shinanigans. A good friend at work swears that she read a story of this characters' graduation from law school and starting with this law firm. I can't find anyone else who knows anything about a previous story. Help!
3,"Great book, bad ending","I loved the book untill the ending. It seemed as if JG needed to end the book in a hury. Other than that, it was great."
4,Someone draws the line; then it's time to pay the tab!,"To be so shrewd and yet so niaive, makes the ending predictable. However, one always sides with the underdog even tho a thief is a thief is a theif!!!"
2,This book has a terrible ending.,This is a good example of a great author writing books to meet the deadline of his publisher. I don't think he had the time to put in a good effort for this book as his earlier ones.
2,Great Begining - Lousy Ending,This book started out as the best John Grisham novel I have ever read with great character development and story line. Grisham had to ruin the whole book by having an ending that was so unlike the character of Patrick that he had developed..
1,"A poor substitute for ""Body Heat""","Instead of reading this book I should have rented ""Body Heat"", the great movie starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner since Grisham owes most of his plot to that movie. An obvious and poorly done rip off."
1,Yikes stay away from this one,"The partner is one of those books where the author must of been on some sort of deadline and the last 20 pages were written showing to that deadline. Although I have read most of Grishams books and have enjoyed most of them, I read the ending 3 times and still didn't understand it.I knew that the twist is they didn't connect but I couldn't decipher what the writer was trying to say. Its probably a best seller because of the brand. The first 90% of the book is a setup to the conclusion of the planners plan being completed.The last one percent is confusing and poorly written. I couldn't figure out which country they were in or when or the timeline."
1,pure junk,"I can't believe that any self-respecting publisher would allow this to be printed. It's obviously meant to be turned into a movie. The writing is insipid - Grishom has a habit of not using full sentences and writing like he talks, which is bad writing technique. The characters are flat, and all the loose ends are too conveniently taken care of. I can't believe I wasted a few precious hours on this, and I am warning others who read this review not to make the same mistake."
1,The big 'J' is back,"It's nice getting up in the morning knowing that my most favourite author is at his peak, did I say peak, I meant rock bottom."
2,His Worst Book,"What can I say? This book had absolutely no drama, no surprises, and it was so bad that I didn't even finish the last 50 pages, because I didn't care how it ended. Time and time again, a plan was made by the bed ridden lawyer, and then it was followed through exactly that way. The characters were also drab, making a very boring tale. I can't believe I read so much of this book. Maybe because the words were big and their were just a few lines per page, making you read a page in about ten seconds. I don't know if I'll ever read another of Mr. Grisham's books again."
1,Literary vomit,"I can't believe that I read this book! I feel like I chopped a few hours off of my life. Its not that Grisham can't write, he has a definite knack for story-telling, but it seems he's more interested in trying to be clever. I was so unhappy that I took the time to read this book that I would honestly call it the worst book I've ever read. Yuck! The only reason that I kept reading it was because I always ""hoped"" it would start to pick up. Its like watching a bad movie on a rainy day just because you can't believe it won't get better. This not only doesn't get better, it falls into an abyss at the end. Instead of buying this book, tear up seven dollars and bang your head with a hammer - its the same effect and at least it will save you time."
2,Grisham Lobotomy,"Reading this book was like a day at the beach, fun while you're there, but too much sunburn and sand in your bathing suit on the hot car ride home. If you decide to read this book, stop before the end and imagine what you will. I guarantee you'll be much happier."
1,Grisham you wasted my time!!,"I can't believ that I read this book! I feel so cheap, so dirty. Its not that Grisham can't write, he has a definite knack for story-telling, but it seems he's more interested in surprising readers than in just letting his gift work for him. I was so unhappy that I took the time to read this book that I would honestly put it in my all-time bottom five. I agree with another review here that it is like a TV movie in book form. Yuck! The only reason that I kept reading it was because it always ""felt"" like something interesting might be about to happen. Its like watching a bad movie on a rainy day just because you can't believe it won't get better. This not only doesn't get better, it falls into an abyss at the end. Instead of buying this book, tear up seven dollars and bang your head with a hammer - its the same effect and at least it will save you time."
1,"An ending so bad, you'll wish you stopped reading early.","So-so plot, never really gets going though. To say that it was poorly constructed would be an understatement. No real action, a good deal of the book was past tense - story within a story type of thing. Ending makes you feel like Grisham stole the hours that it took you to read the book right out of your life. I see mixed reviews here, but you gotta remember, people voted for Clinton, too."
4,What a ride! Ending screams for a sequel.,"Thank you John Grisham for making my daily commute a lot easier with your wonderful adventures - including ""The Partner"" which I enjoyed very much. However, the ending, which was probably meant to be a ""twist,"" seemed weak and illogical to me. A sequel is in order - please."
4,intricate novel,It held me from the start and realized how it can easily manipulate the reader to find out how it will end. It had one of the most beautoful ending I have read from him. Very intelligent.
1,What a let-down!,I literally flung the book across the room after I read it. It was a great read up until the end. I LIKE happy endings. If I wanted to be depressed I would watch the news. Hopefully his next book will not disappoint.
3,I kept waiting for the big disaster; predictable ending,"As I was reading this book, I kept thinking that something else was going to happen. Although the story, and especially the main character Patrick, were interesting, it just left me wanting for something juicier. And, about 100 pages in I knew how it was going to end. Oh well, better luck next time. Normally Grisham keeps me intensely reading (except for A Time to Kill, ugh) but this one left me a little disappointed."
2,"Great start, bad finish!","I've read many Grisham books and generally like his style. He's obviously comfortable in the courtroom setting and I loved the detailed legal twists and turns in The Partner. The sign of a good work of fiction is we come to believe it's a true story about real people. Unfortunately, at the very end I felt the author threw away credibility for the sake of another ""twist"" - unbelievable and very disappointing after such a great ride. If they ever make a movie of this they better have the sense to end it the obvious way that does not betray what has gone before. Five Stars for great writing and plot, minus three stars for ripoff ending = two stars."
4,Legal twist and turns make this a super read,"At first, in the book The Partner I wasn't a big fan of the main character, Patrick. I was not quite sure if I was supposed to want Patrick to get away with everything but found myself on his side even though I didn't know why he had committed this theft. I did admire the way he had every angle thought out. The book was hard to put down. The constant legal twists and turns in the story kept me riveted. Mr. Grisham kept me interested with the number of players in the plot and then he planted this hidden thought of what would it be like to start life over?I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would recommend it highly. Beware; the ending is not expected and rather disheartening."
1,The Partner,"I can't say I hate it...I am a big John Grisham fan but after reading the first chapter, I was not drawn in so I sent it back and exchanged it for another book. Still a Grisham fan. Maybe it just didn't suit my mood at that time."
3,Unbiased Report,"I was intrigued by the novel as have been by all of Grisham's books. It was intense and I had trouble putting it down. It was absolutely great but I didn't like the ending of this one as I didn't like the ending of ""The Client""."
2,"explosive opening, 400 pages of boredom, terrible ending","After the setup - a lawyer fakes his death, steals $90M, escapes to Brazil, only to be caught, tortured, and returned to the US for prosecution - I expected a dynamite book. Then I settled into approximately 400 pages of yawn-yawn lack of action as our hero sits in a hospital, scheming with his lawyer on his legal strategy while recovering from his torture-related wounds. The ending was pathetic. I was expecting some sort of stunning conclusion, perhaps an unexpected confession from left field. Instead, I got the impression Mr Grisham got tired and simply quit writing. It was a very unsatisfying conclusion, which leaves the reader hanging.Score this one as one star for plot. I do bump it up to two stars overall, only because Mr Grisham's style of prose flows well, even if he doesn't really have anything to say."
2,Big disappointment!,"I will let anyone who wants to read this book make up his or her mind as to its quality. However, after reading it, I felt like I had wasted a lot of time. The ending was very disappointing and very illogical to me. Perhaps that was the effect Mr. Grisham was aiming for, I don't know. It seemed to me, though, that the ending was poorly developed and completely inconsistent with prior internal character dialogue."
1,I'm very glad I got this from the library.,This book was almost nothing but backstory filled in via conversations and testemony by various characters. Almost nothing actually happens in this book. you can read the first quarter and the last quarter and really miss nothing. There was no suspence and the protagonist was so flat I kept wishing he had died during the torture in Brazil. Skip this book even if you get it for free.
1,Grisham at his worst.,"Predicable plot, unrealistic treatment of characters, ending created for shock value and not at all tuned into character development.If one more person oggled the legs of Patrick's beautiful friend, I thought I'd gag.There is so much better stuff out there, I'm amazed that people keep buying this swill.Try any of Joe Nesbo's wonderful mysteries with outstanding translation quality - even better than the Girl trilogy."
3,Not Grisham's Best,"This book was disappointing. It is based on a rather complex story line about a law partner who hides millions of settlement dollars from his firm, stages his own death,takes on a new identity to live a new life and then gets caught. The book starts with his capture in Brazil. There a number of different parties tring to learn what he has been doing for the four years on the run and what happened to the money. The book is an intertwining of descriptions of his past activities and of his current tangles with the legal system and those who lost their money. You soon start to realize the author's approach and the questionable plausibility of some events, and that deadens the suspense."
2,Entertaining but unbelievable and lazy,"The Partner is initially entertaining and action packed - I was unable to put it down for the first half of the book. But soon, I got tired of the protagonist's unbelievable, superhuman feats of foresight, planning and executing everything flawlessly, down to his own faked death and then (almost fatal) real torture. Then, I thought the ending to the book was remarkably lazy - it was as if Grisham realized that the pattern of Patrick's superhuman-ness had pretty much guaranteed a certain ending for the last 100 or so pages, and so he was determined to thrown in an unexpected twist in the end. A twist that had no basis, based on his development of characters etc. I found that irritating and lazy."
5,Entertaining,"Grisham dishes out the details the way a good fisherman uses worms for bait--sparingly. He keeps the reader hooked, wanting more. This book's pacing is slower than some other Grisham novels, but it's certainly good entertainment.If you like Grisham's more fast-paced thrillers, you might want to try reading The Golden Catch.--Roger Weston, author ofThe Golden Catch"
3,An entertaining read,"Well, the ending was unexpected and somewhat disappointing. The book overall was a very fun read because it moved at a fast pace and the action kept me interested. But some of the legal aspects weren't very realistic. I love John Grisham as a writer and he definitely does this genre of book better than most. I enjoyed this book for what it was, a quick, entertaining read."
4,The Partner,Really likes the novel. Kept me reading well into the night. I look forward to more from John Grisham. Four Stars!
4,Engaging!,This was a great read. Very inforamtive. It gave you a insight on the workings of the upper legal system.
5,Very intricate,"This novel by Grisham is one of his earlier works with many twists and turns. This is vintage and classic mystery/thriller. Very entertaining and just a great book with a plot that's not easy to figured out.Review by Rahiem Brooks, author of Murder in Germantown"
5,Good book,Once again John Grisham proves to be a master of surprises. The book keeps you engaged as to what the main charater motives and thoughts are and how he implements his brillant plan. I would recommend to this book for all to read.
3,Don't Read the last 5 pages!,"I really enjoyed this book. In fact, if I hadn't read the last 5 pages, I would have given it 5 stars. But, the way that Grisham ends the novel almost negates the entire story. Why have Patrick go through all that he does if the story is just going to end the way it does? Absolutely not worth it! Aside from the ending, the book was absolutely amazing. Totally enthralling. A real page-turner."
2,"Fantastic beginning,horrible ending","I liked this book when I started reading it. It got better and better, Patrick Lanigan had always one more surprise. And they were so clever and so logical that I couldn't believe it. I thought then that Mr.Grisham wrote his best book. I read it and read it and I changed my mind.There are two big mistakes. Why runs Eva away when she sees the FBI people? She learned how to rescue. Patrick must have teached her that. And in the end : if a book has got its own logic in the first 460 pages why must we throw that logic away in the last 7 pages? I still don't understand why John Grisham had to end his book like this. He wanted something amazing? He did it, but that wasn't enough.I'm waiting for his next and better book."
4,The Partner,"I liked it alot all the way to the end. I did not like that he was left hanging and she left him. It seemed totally out of character for her. I could have seen her being angry because her father was dragged into the mess, but given the level of devotion we witnessed in her up to the end I found her abandoning him not plausable."
2,SO disappointed in the ending!,"I have always been a big fan of John Grisham. Obviously some books are better than others, but I can't remember being this disappointed in an ending as much as I was this time."
2,Utterly predictable,"Anybody who claims to not have forseen the final events of this novel must be in denial. On the plus side, the torture sequences were disturbingly well written. Made me uncomfortable, it was quite real. Overall, though, a pretty poor, predicatable, formulaic effort."
3,Yet One More,"Another one in the Grisham burn and churn machine of legal thrillers. All of his stories are about the same so I will not add to the other reviews full of the story details. I just could not believe the main story line, and for me that spelled the death of the book. I kept saying to my self - ""yea right"". Overall, the author continues in his long chain of McBooks and gives us something that holds your interest over TV commercials, but really does not offer a sink your teeth into story. This book is a light, easy to read and complete legal novel that will be forgotten in a few years."
3,Thrilling but Not Worth Coming Back,"This is a well-crafted suspenseful legal thriller, tempting you to devour it in one sitting. Each page turned reveals unexpected twists. But would this novel live up to the test of time? There is the inevitable question of what is left after the suspense is over? Once you finish the novel and know the ending, would you go back to it again and again and savor it like a bottle of fine wine?"
