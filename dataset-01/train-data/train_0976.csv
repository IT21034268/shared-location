1,PERFECT RECIPE FOR A THROBBING HEADACHE!,"I couldn't believe how the people behind the promotions of this trash could claim this is such a good film. I have made video-documentaries myself and based from the footages they've made, the only so-so significant part are the interviews, nothing else and there is not one good video documentary you can make out of those other footages. I have to admit that I was foolish enough to be lured to watch this film, it's worst than the films we have locally. Also, I would like to tell anyone who plans to watch this garbage, this is not even a horror movie, it didn't scare me a bit. What I got at the end of the movie were 1) a throbbing headache 2) an insignificant nightmare for thinking all those times after watching it how bad the movie was and 3) endless disappointments for having to spend on that worthless movie...hear me and deprive yourself of what I felt...!"
1,Okay...Did I Miss Something?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I fall asleep? Guess so. 'Blair Witch' was on TV.Quite honestly, maybe I'm just dull, but I found BW to be completely annoying and not the least bit frightening. Maybe a fan should just explain it to me, then I'll be scared."
1,"I counted 144 usages of the F word, and 0 usages of talent","Out of 1300 reviews, I doubt what I say matters, but oh well.This was BORING, LONG, and STUPID. All the characters do is act poorly and cuss a lot. Most scenes sound something like:Person 1: ""Haha, I kicked the f---ing map into the f---ing creek with my f---ing foot."" Person 2: ""WHAT THE F---? WHAT THE F--- DID YOU DO THAT FOR YOU F---ING MOTHERF---ER? ""Etc.Oh, I forgot to mention: I was not scared for a split second of this movie. Whoever thinks this is ""original"" should try filming themselves running around the woods swearing for seven days and try making 50 million off of it, cuz it worked for the BWP makers!"
1,What?,"I have never been so disappointed! I should have known that with all the hype surrounding this film, it was certainly going to be a stinker. I seen cartoons scarier than this! If people considered this to be scary, they must be afraid of people arguing, since that's all the film amounted to. Save your dough and buy some really scary movies. There's plenty out there better than this!"
1,Worst Movie,"This was a terrible movie. It was not at all scary, and the acting was horrible. Actually, it wasn't even acting. Those kids were just filmed running around in the woods."
1,The Blair Witch Project,DON'T BUY IT! Complete waste of time and money. It took me three days to complete watching this video because I kept falling asleep. A one star rating is definitely too high. Why did they bother making this movie? This is the same producer who made PI another equally BAD film.
3,What if you can't go home again?,"People who have watched The Blair Witch Project and think that the film students were just screw ups because they stayed lost for days, have missed the point. The evil, unseen spirit of the witch, continously prevented them from leaving her neck of the woods. Yes the F- word was too omnipresent. Yes the plot could have been developed a bit better but don't let piles of stones trip you up about that. I must ask you this : How would you feel if an evil witch really wouldn't let you go home? This movie had plenty of drawbacks and was over hyped. However, it pushed that primal, primitive fear button, that resides way down inside the heart of many viewers rather well. Have you seen a stick doll today?"
3,Blair Witch - Had Its Moments,"Regardless of what you think of the movie, it had its moments.The scene when the lady is running through the woods after seeing something, the part when the lady unwraps some sort of bloody thing-a-ma-jig from the bundle of sticks, the climactic part when there is some sort of struggle, all those were good.The ending should not have been so abrupt, though, there should have been more."
1,more like -5 stars,"don't understand what people see in this. without a doubt one of the stupidest movies of all time. scary? you gotta be kidding (well, maybe for a preschooler)."
2,See THE LAST BROADCAST instead,"Blair Witch was a fair spin on the whole ""mockumentary horror"" idea, but it is hardly original. A few years earlier, a better movie came along, but through some tragedy, isn't getting the kudos it really deserves.Blair Witch is rambling, the cameras are so shaky that some audience members would get nauseated during a viewing, and the scares, although bona fide creepy, come few and far between. If you want to see a superior movie with a very similar concept that is much better constructed, less shaky and ultimately more creepy, pick up a copy of THE LAST BROADCAST. It may be hard to find, but it's worth it if you can."
2,Great?more like grazing on the fields of mediocrity.,"Starting off, the only reason why everyone thinks and thought this movie was so great is because it was the first movie of its kind.The movie only had one scary part which i wont ruin for you.Little background on characters(so how sorry for them do you feel).Oh, and like the x files, they scare you by showing you what you arent afraid of.Works for the first 30 minutes, then you get used to a bunch of kids running and screaming..and you dont even hear whats chasing them?WTF.Its stupid like that.But in its defense it does have some cool parts in it."
3,Can You Say Headache?,"The Blair Witch Project was a very well thought out movie. I liked it but at times it really gave me a headache. The camera's moving around all the time really got me mad. I think that the plot and the story were very good and clever. Who in the world wuld have thought of ever making something like this? You should watch it, it is one of those really cool interesting films."
1,The Blair Witch Waste of Time,"I thought this movie was an absolute piece of crap. I have seen scarier images watching various nature docuemntaries. I waited until it was released on video then bought it. Unfortunately I was not able to retrun it after I watched it. The idea that the various critics though this movie was ""Scary as Hell"", Rolling Stone, really upsets me that these are the people who millions of movie patrons listen to on movie recommendations. I though it was an overhyped piece of crap with 3 mediocre performers, with great footage of the ground. Unfortunately I cannot rate this movie less then 1 star, but if I could I would."
1,was I fooled,"I read all of the hype, I heard all of the hype, I was unable to go see it at the movies, but everyone said it was so great, so I bought it before I saw it! I should have my hand cut off! Boy did I get screwed! This is the dumbest, most worthless excuse of a movie I have ever seen. Anyone who even gives this movie anykind of recognition, should be shot, disenboweled, dragged through the streets, and their head put on a stick in town square for display of their STUPIDITY!"
1,ugh,"I rarely feeled compelled to write a review about a movie, but in this case, I had to.As someone that loves a good horror movie (and there hasn't been one in a while!), I was anxious to see this film. What a disappointment! How anyone could be ""terrified"" by this embarrassment is beyond me. I was close to actually stopping this movie half-way through, and I always finish a movie, no matter how bad it is. All I could do was grit my teeth and listen to the non-stop bickering and the god-awful screaming. And please don't give me the ""originality"" argument! ""Original"" does not necessarily equal ""Good"".....The only ""Scary"" thing about this movie, is how many people gave it good reviews!"
1,TOO MUCH HYPE FOR A BAD MOVIE,"I was really excited to see this movie. I love scary movies, and I really wanted to see it, thinking it would be scary. It was far from scary and a bore. I almost fell asleep. I don't understand why the critics liked this movie so much. The whole movie was just 3 people yelling at eachother...WOW. Not. Bottom line: don't bother"
2,They made one big mistake that ruined the movie...,"Why didn't they show the witch at the end or something? Or a noise of it, or blood, or at least some kind of hint to show that the Blair Witch was there, and the students would meet their doom. That would have made the movie scary at the end (at least for me). It would also leave you with a haunting nag as if to ask: what happened to them. They should have showed something shocking in the house at the end, to make the movie more complete, instead of that ending that just left you confused. That's what I think"
3,Could have been..!,"A rumor was spread that this movie was made of real footage found out side a forest! This made me live the THRILL and SHOCKING SUSPENSE..!After removing the reality from the story and knowing that it was fiction... the movie turned into a cheap budget myth!If only the rumor was real, this would have been something very powerful, very emotional, very thrilling, but now..!To enjoy it, live the experience as if it was made of genuine footage!"
2,Maybe in the cinema...,"Alright...I watched this video at home and in the middle of the day, maybe that has something to do with what I think of the movie, I don't know. I totally do not get why people are so exited about it, because I thought it totally sucked!! Nothing happens, they just keep arguing through the entire movie and while I was watching I was like, When are they going to start the movie??? I'm sure that it'd be a little better in the evening or something, but I can't imagine ever liking this movie"
1,why cant i give it a zero,"this movie put me to sleep the first time i wasted six bucks on it in a theater, and it had the very same effect when my girlfriend made me rent it. i don't know how i can say it any clearer: THIS MOVIE WAS NOT SCARY, IT WAS BORING! RESIST THE HYPE! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!"
1,The Blair Witch Project,"Soooo Baaad. . .What a complete and total waste of time! If your rating system allowed it, I would have given it ZERO STARS ! Totally boring, and completely devoid of any redeeming qualities. Do you want to know what is really scary? The mere thought that there are people amongst us who have seen BWP, and actually rated it good. Those of us with any common sense left should all be afraid.....BE VERY A-F-R-A-I-D ! !"
1,Much ado about nothing,"For a no-budget horror movie this one got lots of reviews and this one is a huge disappointment with no budget,no blood,no special effects, and no villian/monster. Three foul-mouthed filmmakers go the woods and do a documentary to find a legend about a witch. This isn't a even a horror movie or much of anything. Please don't believe the hype and waste time on this overrated movie. If you want a good no-budget horror-comedy with gore,blood,demons,and special effects rent Evil Dead, If you want completly boring movie rent this or House of the Dead. The only good part of this is the end when they all die."
4,A Shockumentary for sure!,"Filmed in a documentary type fashion, this film creates a tension from start to finish which creates a very effective scare tactic.Probably overhyped on it's release, this film still manages a chill or so after repeated viewings.A group of students set out to investigate the Blair Witch in Maryland and learn more about her and her activities and manage to get caught up in them as well.The ending is a bit mysterious if not totally creepy, and you really need to pay attention during the movie to understand exactly what is going on.At times convoluted and otherwise confusing, the movie does end up wrapping up itself to some explainable conclusion. The fact that this was made up a documentary only adds flavour to this eerie little film. A must for horror fans."
5,Great horror in a fine tradition,"This movie is not so much a ground breaker as it is a return to the basics of good horror, reminiscent of the original The Haunting from the 1960's. There are no special effects, very little blood and no gore. The menace is never directly shown, just hinted at with increasing intensity as the film unfolds. There is good reliance on proper setting (dark, gray days in the fall/winter, deep in the woods), sympathetic characters (tho they could have been more likeable), and, above all, a fine progression in the minds of the characters from casual enthusiasm for the project to absolute dread. The climactic scene in the old house was chilling, esp. the final few seconds. This is a thinking person's horror movie, unlike the abysmal sequel. Watch it often."
1,Blair Witch On Blu-Ray??,"Blair Witch on Blu-Ray. A movie shot mostly with a VHS camcorder is now available on Blu-Ray.....uh...Anyone who buys this is the very definition of the word ""sucker"""
5,so many don't understand,"I've talked to at least 5 people who saw this movie and didn't care for it. When I asked if they understood it they said not really. Once I explained the movie to them and what the ending with the camera just dropping means, they've all said ""Oh I get it, that makes it pretty good. I guess the movie was just too smart for some people. That makes one thing apparent. As I read a lot of reviews not only on this film but many others, I'm convined there are a lot of very slow minded people out there. That's ok, I have no problem with that. I have just one request. Could you people stop writing bad reviews on movies simply because ""YOU"" don't understand the movie. You're lack of intelligence does not mean it's a bad movie."
1,Horrible!,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was bad, the plot was bad and the ending was horrible. Don't listen to all the hype, this movie is a waste of your time and money. Don't even rent it!"
1,"Boring, Pointless, Waste of Time","I waited through this entire piece of trash for something to happen. Nothing ever did. Just a bunch of vulgar-mouthed teens thrashing around in the woods after dark and never really finding much of anything. The most boring movie I ever watched. It could have been so much more. Might have been a good 1/2 hour Twilight Zone episode, but Rod Serling would have done a much better job in a half hour than this did in a full length movie. Nothing scary here at all and such a disappointment at the end."
1,Big hype Big bore,This movie really got scores with all the trailers and tidbits shown on tv.... I went and watched this thinking it would scare the wits out of me. Much to my surprise it actually put me to sleep...... I have seen better than this Much better if you don't get bored easily see it for yourself more hype than anything.
1,what a piece of crap,"I live in Panama, so the blair witch project was released over here like 4 months after it had been released in the US. I had heard so many good things about this movie, wow so many people making lines and lines outside the theatres to see this ""masterpiece"". This has already been done, and in much better, realistic ways, I can't believe it, thank god the sixth sense came to rescue the year, because if not who know how much more money this huge piece of $h¡t would have made, sure the creators are multimillionares by now, thanks to all of those stupid people that threw their money away. It runs at like 1hr40mins, it seemed longer that Titanic!"
2,Blare Boring Witch Project,"Yes, it has a new way of filming things, from the actors perspective. Yes, it relies on suspense and the unkown to drive your fear. Yes, critics love it. Does that make it something you should buy? Nope.The characters are unbelievable, getting lost in the woods in Maryland? And next to a river no less? It is insane that someone could be that stupid. The suspense created through the filming is nice, and a good break from the teen-age horror flick, but it is ruined by the horrible acting, bad dialogue and ridiculous precept. Do not waste your time and money, it just isn't worth it... you find yourself wishing it were over... and then it is and you say THANK YOU!"
1,What Happens When Producers Go Broke,This movie was horrible. The filming was amateur and the plot was shot. It never should have gone to theatres. I'd give it a 0 any day.
1,Wanna see something real scary?,"If you want to see something real scary, then this is not the film for you. The fact that we now know that it is not ""real"" basically killed the atmosphere of an otherwise okay film. I personally liked the film - but only because it was different. If you want a scary film, with a twist in the tale, go see the Sixth Sense."
3,"Not Really Good, But Original!!!","I must say I thought this movie was kind of dumb and the only reason I even like it is because of the originality. There has never really been a movie released like this before. I think one of the reasons this movie gets so many good reviews is because of the hype of this movie during it's release. I would recommend that if you want to see this movie you should rent it, save your money. After watching this movie I did have a headache from all the cameras moving constantly(so if you get dizzy easily watch out). I must say the director of this movie must have a creative mind."
4,Creative yet slightly overrated,I caught this film when it was first released in Philadelphia. It's very creative yet I've seen much better as far as the horror movie is concerned. The film does have a realism that I enjoyed. The begining was real slow but after they go into the woods everyone watching is in for a treat. I like the Sixth Sense better but that doesn't mean I didn't like this. Check it out.
3,Just A Little Over Hyped,"The film that has spawned countless spoofs is available on video and I advise you buy it. It may have been hyped beyond belief but it is still worth the purchase. It may not be the classic that was promised but it certainly beats certain Hollywood trash that is around at the moment. A little slow to get going but the final hour will have a chill running all round your body, the final scene in particular is pure genious. Plenty of flaws but is still a great night time film."
1,Where's Dorothy When You Need her to melt this film?,"I was terribly dissapointed with this movie. Despite the shaky film and the over all unhinged feeling of the movie, I was lost due to the lack of a good story set up. All I saw was three frightened college students screaming into the night. I thought blairwitch.com was scarier. By the time they got to the house at the end, I was rooting for the witch to put me out of my misery. Where was Dorthy Gale to land a house on this thing? For more fun, check out the Scooby-Doo Project on Cartoon network! Loads of fun !"
3,Realistic -- to a fault,"Well, the film makers certainly succeeded in doing what they were out to do -- create the illusion that you were watching raw footage. And that illusion does make the last third of this movie especially frightening. However, the illusion was so well done that until things started getting really nasty for Heather, Josh, and Mike, this film made me feel the way everyone feels about that friend or relative who insists on dragging out his home movies/videos every time you go to visit him -- that maybe you don't want to go visit him after all."
1,Ridiculous,"Yesterday I saw the film in our local cinema. Yes, it takes some time before a movie makes it to Austria. I could not believe it. This was the famous Blair Witch Project, which seems to have caused so many sleepless nights and even made it on the covers of TIME amd NEWSWEEK. I just can't see why. There was not one creepy moment in the whole movie. The whole thing was so dull that you could only laugh about it. Okay, 3 people are lost in the woods. They are frightened, they fear for their lifes. What are they doing? They are filming each other! They hear sombody scream, they come to a mysterious house. What are they doing? Are they looking for some kind of weapon? Maybe a stone or a branch? No, they are still filming! One of the filmers gets lost. What is the other doing? You got it, he is still filming! This so called film is a joke. There is only one mystery about the Blair Witch. Why did it make so much money?"
4,An interesting change...,"It's easy to be influenced by the hype that surrounds 'The Blair Witch Project' but if you disregard the media's tendency to over exaggerate the impact of a film , you can still enjoy this movie. I was initially sceptical about the effectiveness of the film's format, and the ordinary nature of the story for the first half of the film. However, the atmosphere grows on you and the impact of the build up to the last few scenes is well worth waiting eighty minutes for. The horror is cleverly dealt with in this film, which makes 'The Blair Witch' a welcome change from the big budget Hollywood horror flicks. It presents suspense and fear in real terms and doesn't give you a scare simply because of a cleverly timed soundtrack noise. All in all, this film is worth a look, the fear stays with you long after you switch it off."
1,Really bad movie,"I am glad that I paid just only $4 for pay per view--not VHS or DVD. I never seen movie like this in my life--really sick because of motion sickness and headeache. Don't waste your money if you are not wierd. I don't understand why some people think this is a good movie.I am really sick because of seeing the camera shaken all the time. This kind of movie, your child can make it with camcorder(just shake it! )"
1,The longest 80 minutes in my life,This was probably the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life. I could have had more fun if I had taken my 80 skr (10$) and grinded it to dust. A tip to you all who are going to see this movie... Don't.
3,Only good to watch one time.,"If you want to see this movie, just let me tell you. Rent the movie instead of buying it because when you watch it the first time, you will like it. But it doesn't want you to watch it a second time. Its a good scary movie to watch, but watch the movie only once. It's more scarier that way"
1,Gives the word BAD a whole new meaning,"Scary? I must have missed that part. They sure seemed scared, it would have been nice it we could have seen why. Seems like they ran out of film half way through. I would rather go visit my dentist than watch this one again. The only thing good about this movie was the marketing."
1,Nothing but hype,"I agree that the unknown can be scary, but The Blair Witch Project is about nothing, and nothing is boring. Frankly, I believe that people who say they like this film are most afraid of admitting they were suckered in by the hype."
5,If Any Film Can Truly Scare You....This Is The One!,"If some of the scenes in this landmark film didn't scare the heck out of you....then you're incapable of being scared! This is truly one of the most frightening motion pictures I've ever watched.We never see a witch, or a wild-eyed maniac with a chainsaw, or any ghost-like figures. These images that we never see, but THINK we might run into at any moment, are precisely what make this film so effectively chilling.The viewer begins to put himself into the shoes of the characters....and we begin to wonder, just like the frightened people in the movie -- What the heck is making those strange noises!? We never see what it is, and neither do the characters. But we do get some exceptionally eerie clues along the way. Clues that only increase our anxiety.So hang onto something and experience ""The Blair Witch Project""! It's a highly memorable movie experience."
2,I've never been less scared my entire life,"This idea had potential, but ended up just being drawn out and repetitive. It would have been better if ""whoever"" was stalking the kids was taking home videos for their own sadistic pleasure... that would have been scary... this was just uninteresting. Watching gave me more a feeling ""if I was there I'd be freaked out"", but watching it on a screen didn't quite make it.It get's 1 star for originality and 1 star for the scene when the guy tells the other two what happened to the map, the only scene in the whole movie that illicited a response from me, laughter."
5,A Chill that Lingers.....,"Remember the classic line from Poltergeist: ""It knows what scares you""? The writers and producers of this film know what REALLY frightens us....not the slash-and-burn gore or hiding-behind-the-door frights of most modern horror films. No, the fear you will feel welling up in you while watching this movie (and for days afterward) is more basic and primal; the fear of being lost, alone, hungry, and hunted; of the monster that lurks just out of sight. It reawakens and brutally exploits those basic childhood fears that most of us have buried. This movie isn't designed to make you jump in your seat, but it will chill you to the bone. It is claustrophobic, harrowing, tortuous....and wonderful."
5,You will remember your first view for a lifetime.,"If you ever sat around a campfire terrified as a child listening to ghost stories and want to revisit that feeling then this movie is for you. If you let yourself believe in the ""rumours"" at the beginning of the movie then you are i for a very entertaining time. I enjoyed this movie very much."
3,YOU MEAN NO ONE HAD A CELLPHONE?? C'MON!,"yeah it was cheesy and badly acted in spots, and the arguing was annoying, but it was still pretty creepy and worth at least one viewing...better than the laughably bad Scream...oh, p.s. go rent RUSHMORE! it rocks."
4,Scared the **** out of me.,"I had heard very little about this movie before I rented it, only that it was pretty scary. I didn't know what to expect, maybe a Friday the 13th kind of scary, but this is totally different. The documentary style of the movie is what really terrified me -- it seemed so real."
2,Hype scores again,"I just watched this so-called horror flick. More like MTV ""Real World"" meets ""Deliverance."" Very disappointed with it. The implied horror wasn't very well implied and it wasn't that scary, either. It was simply really boring. However, it was original and creatively made. It's worth watching once for that. Just don't get your hopes set too high."
1,The Blair Rip=Off Project,Good Concept but a very stupid story line. What was all the hype about? The movie makers are laughing all the way to the bank.
1,blair witch project,good thing i did not have to pay for to see this piece of garbage by the way i did not want to give it a star but its required
1,This was the most awful movie ever made...,This movie was awful.There is no other way to say it. It had the potential to be good but they went NOWHERE with it. I guess because of their limited budget but that doesn't change the outcome.It's a totally predictable movie that leaves you wondering why it was made when you leave the theatre. Nothing is explained about half of the things mentioned on the movie.This is a DO NOT BUY.
2,"Where's the ""thriller""?","Having experienced the master of psychological thrillers, Alfred Hitchkock, in my youth, I find nothing eerie, or scary, about The Blair Witch Project. The two moments in the film worth watching were left unexplained...therefore meaningless. Script was poor, camera technique juvenile, plot sophomoric at best. The only thing that kept me awake after seeing the movie was the screeching of the female lead...truly annoying. If you are tempted to purchase the movie based on the lure of previously undiscovered footage, be advised that they are only trailers used for advertising. $130 million dollars...boy, weren't we all duped by the studio hype."
5,It was the scariest movie I've ever seen!,This was the scariest movie I've ever seen. It will really make you think about going camping for quite a while! It also makes you think about witches and witch craft.
3,The Blair Witch Project - It's great movie,I have seen this movie and I loved it. I say if you've seen it you would understand but for the fact I thought it was awesome. You are either going to hate it or love it but I would tell anyone who has doubt in there head wether to see it or not to go and watch it. It is a classic horror movie.
1,Horrible Movie...not Horror Movie,"Someone had the audacity to compare this movie to ""The Exorcist."" This comparison applies only if you are as afraid of the devil as you are afraid of fallen leaves in the forest...which is all ""The Blair Witch Project"" manages to show us. This movie was not the least bit scary...not the least bit horrifying...just plain horrible...the worst release of the year. If you want to experience a horrifying chronicle of getting lost in the woods, read Stephen King's ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"" which really taps into what is psychologically and physically frightening about being lost. ""The Blair Witch Project,"" on the other hand, robs the emotions and the intellect...how long are we expected to watch Heather scream at her companions for losing the map? Rent ""The Exorcist."" There really is NO comparison."
1,Garbage at an all time LOW!,"To put it simply, this was a waste of money, time, and hope. I would have rather have my eyeballs burned from my head than sit through this horrendous excuse for entertainment. The only thing which scared me was the fact I wasted money to watch it..."
5,It's soooooooo good!!!,"The movie i rate it would have to be the scarest out there. not only do people wonder if all of this is real, but thats the whole thing behind it. it truly will ""scare the hell out of u"""
2,All I have to say is that this movie was very creepy.,"It's very creepy and I just loved the ending. It was not the best movie of the MIllenium. I wont ever see it again. I heard that there is a second part coming. I'll have to see that,I just hope it's nothing like the first one. I'm hoping for something very different and more scary."
1,This movie is not worth it.,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is incredibly boring and stupid. The last five minutes are the only part worth watching, to avoid the motion sickness that some people experience when watching this film. I appreciate the how the lack of special effects make this movie even more creepy, but it's not all it is hyped up to be."
2,"nice concept, overall a little boring","Rent this movie before you buy it. The first two thirds I found pretty boring, with some more exciting sections in between. The end of the film was probably worth the wait, but then I'm not all too impressed. The documentary that comes with DVD version was a nice add-on. Beware, severe camera-shake can cause motion sickness."
2,"Very amateurish, camera work made me dizzy, boring not scary","I was bored, never scared and couldn't believe the wonderful advance billing the movie received. The film makers must have paid off a lot of people. I felt like an idiot during the film thinking how stupid I was to have wasted time and money on that dreadful film."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz,"What a waste of time. Poor acting, no music, and no ending. About as scary as a Barney movie."
1,Wonderful movie if.....,"you need a good nights rest. A friend and I watched it in the bedroom, in separate beds, in the dark. We kept waiting for the scary parts. Was it here? Now was it going to happen? Uh-oh, maybe we missed it! Rewind time......Nope, still not scary. Not knowing if it was real or not was the ""scariest"" part of the story. HAD those wandering souls been real people who disappeared many moons ago, THAT would have been scary.It amazes me that it made as much as it did. Maybe with the profits, the cameramen can go take a course in photography. The girl can go to etiquette class. The guys can get a real map. I've had a scarier experience in my bathroom. Did you know that you can predict your death by turning off the lights and placing a candle by your face. Now that, fellow video lovers, is scary."
2,A really really really overhyped movie that DOES NOT deliver,"I saw this movie over the summer, and thought it was lousy. Not scary at all, just a brilliant marketing job driving people toward a product that simply didn't deliver the goods. Well, I just watched it again this afternoon on video and I am more confident than ever in my opinion that THIS REALLY IS NOT A VERY GOOD MOVIE.Some of the things Josh and Mike say are funny, and the ending is kind of cool, but overall the movie just dragged on and seemed pointless. Stick figures hanging in trees and piles of rocks are NOT SCARY. There just wasn't enough tension or a sense of claustrophobia to make the movie interesting. Frankly, until the final 2 minutes, I was pretty bored. Apparently, a lot of you were.In summary, a great marketing job for a pretty lame flick."
3,Clever Idea But Over-Hyped,"By now everybody, except those living in caves knows about Blair Witch Project, how it was filmed (shaky camcorder documentary style), what the plot is, how cheap it was to make and how much money it made. This was a very clever idea, very cheaply shot and if you happened to be one of the lucky ones to see this movie before all the hype (about it being the scariest film ever) then you were probably thrilled but sadly it was over-hyped and for everybody who subsequently sees it, it is usually a let-down. It's just not a very scary movie but it is original and it does have a spooky ending which stays with you for days and nights afterwards. All in all though this is a triumph mostly for the internet marketing campaign that made it such a hit, rather than for it's originality, which is a pity. However, it's a pretty good buy at a bargain price (...)."
3,Mixed feelings.,"First of all this is not exactly ""horrific"". It is not exactly suspenseful, however I do find it a little captivating and creative. I totally disagree with that guy that said that teens were warped with gory special affects. ???? . Well my favorite horror movie is the Classic American John Carpenter film ""Halloween"". Gory gags weren't needed in that movie. It was scarier without seeing a person getting killed in unrealistic, bloody ways. I'll tell you another thing, ""The Blair Witch Project"" needed to throw in ""the F word"" a million times, because without it, the movie would probably be a half an hour long. In conclusion watch it once, leave it on the shelf untill next year."
2,Good premise for a low-budget film...that is all,"The movie is about three college students who disappeared while filming a documentary about a legendary witch. By showing only this ""documentary"", we have a clever way to employ cheap cinematography in a potentially good movie.While the actors put forth a good effort, the acting was still at a level that was distracting. Suspension of disbelief was therefore impossible. The three main characters were not distinct, having similar speech patterns and temperament. They could not evoke sympathy.A more refined plot could have also helped."
4,It was pretty spooky.,This movie was pretty spooky and pretty good on top of that. I thought it was one of the most scariest movies i've seen in a long while.cool.
1,Plan 9 contender,"Hey, who are they kidding? When they produced this film, they must have thought they were vying with Ed Woods for producing the Worst Picture Ever Made.... I think they won. I would love to see the script for this rotten egg: 60 pages of screaming or one line: ""Where are we? Where are we?"" with film direction: Pan camera through trees. Oh! And that ending is SOooooo scarey! (Not as scarey as the back of my refrigerator.) They owe us a couple of rating stars for producing this mindless drivel."
1,This movie ain't that great.,"I thought this movie was going to be cool, but it wasn't. I went to see it in the theater, and I completely wasted my money. This is supposed to be some teens doing their own video-taping. The camera was all over the place; it made me seasick. Don't rent this movie, don't watch this movie, don't even bother with this movie. All the stupid scenes with the girl whining about how scared she is get really, really old really, really fast."
1,Putrescent Overhyped Garbage!!,"This is arguably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I took my fiance to see the movie at a beautiful old theatre around the corner (you know the kind -- perfect place to see a scary movie).This was truly a ""student movie"" -- obvious from the lack of a grey-cell to share between the actors (if you can call them that).Suffice it to say, when the movie finished -- as one, the whole theatre burst into laughter. But don't buy this thinking there was any comedy -- I think we were laughing at ourselves for wasting money -- and two hours we will never get back....."
1,"Sophmoric, vulgar, dull and stupid.","Who in the world is hyping this movie? It is amateurish, irritating to watch, worse than a home movie on telephoto without jitter control. A trial to watch, the script consists almost entirely of f__k, s__t and variations and combinations. Very wearing. The story is non-existent unless you are afraid of the dark in the forest. And even then it's a stretch.A cult movie to be loved only by those who emulate the actors. An embarrassment to the school that produced these dropouts.A waste of time and resources."
2,I Am SO Bored! ...,"Three film-makers trek into the deep woods of Maryland in order to uncover the mystery of the Blair Witch. Nothing is ever discovered, other than the fact that I'll never get back the time I wasted on this toilet raft! I spent the entire length of the movie waiting desperately for something, anything remotely frightening to happen. The true terror hit me when I realized it was over, and I could have spent the time clipping my toenails or cleaning the fridge! If horrible ""acting"", dorky dialogue, and ridiculous ""effects"" (EEK! They're shaking the tent!) are your bag, then TBWP is a masterpiece! If you've ever been scared by ghost stories while on a campout, you've already experienced far more serious chills than are to be found here. Silly and dull to the point of inducing a state of suspended animation. Ignore the false hype. Stay away! For God's sake, stay away! ..."
1,Waste of time,I saw this movie when it was in the theatres. After listening to all the hype about this movie it was such a let down.
1,Cinematic Tripe!,"To those who feel that this a fantastic example of how low budget horror should be, I have this to suggest: GO WATCH NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD! Blair Witch Project is an irritating and laughable attempt, using the title ""independent film"" to mask and excuse the rotten acting and tortureous camera work. Whatever sense of fear and suspense that Blair Witch struggles to raise is rapidly struck down by the out of control wailings of an actress who should really keep her mouth shut. As well, where grainy black and white could have been utilized to enhance the mood of the film, the makers of Blair Witch choose instead to slap the viewer with shakey camera work. So much could have been done to make this movie good, starting with better script development and ending with aesthetic sensibility."
3,Black & White (mostly dark scenes).,"Got talked into renting this movie --- tedious, but interesting dialogues --- strange ending will leave you guessing.Not really scary."
1,This movie is absurd!,I must have been living under a rock when this film was first released because I knew very little about it when I rented it. BIG MISTAKE! I was under the illusion that the film was a real documentary that had been discovered. Not only is it not real it is not even good as a fake documentary. I was so dizzy from the camera going up and down and round and round that I could barely keep up. Also the language is filthy. The female explorer should have her mouth sewn shut. It was trashy and vulgar. When the film ended (thank goodness) my husband and I just looked at each other with dumbfounded stares and debated on whether we should ask that our money be refunded. Don't bother with this one. The movie is certainly not frightening but knowing how receptive and excited the entire country was about this film is extraordinarly frightening.
2,uh oh...,"OK---I didn't see this at the cinema and maybe I should've done. I was expecting something amazing but this was just lame. As other reviewers have said, it was just boring. The characters (especially the girl) are so intensely annoying that you just cannot wait for them to go down. I didn't think it had any real atmosphere at all and the joggling camera REALLY started to bug me after 20 minutes. And as for that last scene, with the guy against the wall? I thought he was there emptying his bladder. I gave this one star for the audacity of the hype and another star for the actor with the goatee (Josh) as he is quite fit and the only reason for a repeated viewing."
4,The Blair Witch 10 years later 8.5/10 Part 2 is on The Blair Witch Experience reviews,"The Blair Witch Project was a 1999 film starring Heather Donahue, Micheal Willams & Joshua Leonard all as themselves the story is 3 collage students are making a documentary in the woods of Burkittsville Maryland & as the title says a year later there footage was found. They get lost in the woods & lots of freeky creepy s**t happens.I'll admit it I saw it when I was 13 & I didn't like it but after repeated viewings & being a little older & a little wiser I like it for what it is a well done independent movie. Back when I was 13 it did 1 thing right scare the h**l out of me. If your in your teens or have the intelligence of a teen this film ain't for you go see your Saw movie & it's half a dozen sequels. The acting is bad but Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard & Micheal Willams came off as real people. They just weren't characters they were Josh, Heather & Micheal"
1,Headache!,"Probably one of the worst horror movies ever! I heard of people getting headaches and I was one of them. This movie is pure garbage. Not scarry, not interesting, not original and not worth a DIME! I will try to forget the fact that I actually payed for this."
1,horrifying,"this movie is horrifying. horrifyingly hyped up. this movie is not scary at all. i had heard it was like the scariest movie ever. pleas, the scariest part of the movie was just when a camera drops. a camera dropping. if that is the scariest scene in a horror movie then this movie shouldnt of even made it to the theater. it should have been a straight to video realease. take my advice dont but or rent this movie its all hype."
1,Not EVEN Entertaining,"This movie lacks everything, from good acting to a well developed script. The plot is by now very well known, however this moview is neither scary nor entertaining. It is impossible to feel what is on screen is actually occurring (or did occur) hence making it jsut as impossible to be scared by the movie. As a horror movie it failed me. The script and acting are so bad, that watching BWP is worse than having to read a dreadful novel for your high school english class....the first 20 minutes or so of the movie are unbearable, worse than bad documentary. Well, I for one did not appreaciate this movie, but I can only speak for myself."
1,Save Your Money and Watch Scooby Doo Instead!,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is tied with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" for the most overrated and downright silly movie of 1999.The plot is really pretty simple - a bunch of Gen X'ers get lost in the woods, say the ""F"" word a lot, and get picked off one by one. Nothing you can't get from your average episode of ""Scooby Doo"", except for the language and violence. But even if foul language and wanton violence are what you want in a movie, there are still better choices than this."
3,YOU NEED IMAGINATION,"I find that if you don't have imagination and you just can't see getting scared with out witnessing the big slimmy monster and you would rather have lots of blood, gore, and death then you will hate this movie with a passion. But if you tend to let your imagination run away with you and you are able to picture this happening to you then you will love it. This film portrays it as if you are there with them and you only see and know what they know. There are now super brave heroes and there are no slimmy creatures. Only the dark, strange noises, and something constantly watching you. I liked it because it is very realistic. The characters panic, cry, and blame one another just like any normal human would do in real life. But i still prefer the blood and gore as well so i am in between. So you make the choice."
1,This movie reeks!,"I would have assigned this movie minus stars if that option had been available. If you are afraid of your own shadow and your IQ matches your shoe size then this is the movie for you. However, if you have any gray matter in your head you will avoid this movie like the plague. It is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should have a subtitle, ""I'm Gonna Make A Cheap, Boring, Waste of Time, Idiotic Movie and Hype It To The Rafters So I Can Rip People Off and Laugh All The Way To The Bank!"" Being from the Capitol Hill area of DC I can tell you that listening to the bologna espoused by our elected (and wannabe elected) officials is infinitely scarier than anything this movie has to offer"
1,Better to call it the Blair Witch Bomb,"Amid all the hype about this movie I saw a ""documentary"" about it on TV and thought it might be real. My sister, daughter and I had to go to a city 130 miles away to see it. What a waste! Turns out the documentary was scarier than the movie. My daughter, who is 19, really was unnerved. My sister and I kept looking at each other thinking ""We paid money for this?"" My thought was that if I was lost in the woods, to heck with the cameras, let's get our attention on getting unlost. I think you would have to be in your teens or early twenties to be able to identify with these foul mouthed college students. I just couldn't make the stretch."
1,You cannot be serious?,"I cannot believe that such a strongly fancied film can actually have been such unadulterated garbage! I was totally convinced that this was going to be a fantastic movie; The reviewers were convinced, some friends saw it in the USA and said it was good and the newspaper reviewers said it was good - It couldn't possible be anything other than good? Oh boy was I angry when I saw it. A bunch of American students running around swearing at each other for 80 minutes and getting scared about absolutely nothing! The girl narrator was appalling. We got to the end and a friend broke the silence with ""I feel like I just wasted an hour of life waiting for it to get better"" DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS RUBBISH!"
1,"Disappointing, scary as a mud puddle.","I had high hopes for this movie, and it let me down completely. Bad acting, unneeded and constant use of the F word. Undeveloped story... The main characters totally unlikeable. I personally couldn't wait until they were killed off. It could have been a great movie, but the producer/director/actors would all have to be changed and a writer who knows how to develop a story would have to be hired. I gave it one star only because zero wasn't in the menu."
2,Outdoor Marriage Counseling,"My title is taken from another reviewer. That's how he described this movie and he is spot on. A lot of screaming, crying, gnashing teeth, whining, bitch-slapping, bed wetting. Oh and about 250 F-words. Such a piss-poor movie. I'm all for making horror movies that don't show too much, but this piece of turd doesn't show ANYTHING. Nothing. I'm sorry, but lame. Low budget is not the problem. Overacting, no script, and no idea what the hell you are doing, is. I have been more scared by the spiders in my basement than this jelly.If your expecting a story, look elsewhere. If you are looking to be scared, look elsewhere. If you are looking to find a cure for your insomnia, enjoy."
2,Boring Ripoff,"This was one of those totally 90s things that has already dated pretty bad. Basically a boring ripoff of Cannibal Holocaust about student film makers who go into a woods investigating a legend about a witch and never returned but their footage was found. Pretty good voodoo vibe in it, but the cast is so bland it's just not scary not even the ending any more. It doesn't suck, it just has dated really bad from its 1999 release. Anything 90s wasn't cool this decade."
2,Like watching a stinky piece of cheese.,"Having heard so much about how scary The Blair Witch Project was, I thought it'd be a great film to watch on a Friday night. Unfortunately, it ended up being a waste of five dollars. I don't see what's so scary about it; all you really see is three kids running around in the woods and getting lost, which is frightening, but only if you're one of them! Stick figures popping practically out of nowhere is mysterious from the audience's point of view, but doesn't exactly send chills down one's spine, unless, again, you're one of those kids. There really is nothing scary about the film, with the exception of the fact that it was based on a true story and if there is one area the film succeeded in, it was making you apprehensive about venturing out into the woods of Burkittsville, MD."
5,On the edge of your seat horror flick.,"I know many people were disappointed in the film because it wasn't scary enough or the ending was rather dumb. If you actually follow the story deeply and understand it, then you would see that it isn't all about making you pee your pants. This film is definitely a great one and it was made to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The whole movie was excellent because it leaves you thinking -- and thinking is good, because you wouldn't want everyting explained to you. It's fun to try figuring things out on your own."
1,Worthless,"The Blair Witch Project proves that you can have no budget, zero production value, no script, terrible actors, hopelessly incompetent photography...and still make a lousy film. This is that film."
1,Good marketing can sell anything...even this drek!,"This isn't even a good student film! How anyone can claim to have been frightened by this movie is beyond me. There's no story flow, no real character development--just bad acting, bad dialogue, cheesy camera work--and all hype. It's amazing that a horror film this short gets boring real fast and nearly puts you to sleep before the non-ending. I see lots of movies, and this is about the worst thing I've seen in many years. Save you money; don't buy it."
1,The scariest movie of the 90's??,"I will be the first to accept this movie is innovative. But it wasn't scary at all. Just a lot of screaming, wailing and running around with a camera.It's a must see for people who like something different, and you will never see something like this again.For me, the scary part is that people say the sequel is worst. Well, but that's another review."
1,Goofball Producers Seduce Gullible Public.,"This exercise in futility has to rank below Attack of The Killer Tomatoes! How this film cost 40k to make is beyond me, not just how everyone followed the blind man over the cliff to the tune of 100 plus million!! It only resembles some stupid city kids getting lost in their back yard, running around in circles , talking about nothing, and using the f word in excess of several thousand times.....what a script! Anyone who shelled out good money to see this at the theater and ALSO BOUGHT POPCORN...well,if you had all put a dollar into the kitty, you might have been able to make a movie just as good or better."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie sucks; plain and simple. Granted, the producers do a decent job of building suspension throughout the movie, but You call that an ending? Hell, I've coughed up scarier things than that. I simply don't understand how any one can give this movie more than one star - and even that's being generous. I am not kidding; When I saw this movie, followed by it's abrupt, enormously disappointing conclusion, there was a collective groan among the entire audience - and that's no exaggeration. ""That's it?"" ""That's the ending??"" ""You have got to be kidding me!"" Please, don't waste your money on this excuse of a horror film, whether it's in the cinema, on VHS, or on DVD. Spend your time watching a classic like ""The Exorcist,"" or something more current AND creative such as ""Stir of Echos."""
1,hype 1 cinema 0,"there's already 1000+ reviews so really just wanted to add my 1 star to the total. the whole found footage thang was done much better in, ""cannibal holocaust."" i was quickly moved to extreme boredom and remained in that state for the duration. 5 stars for the hype though. could make a good entry in an updated, ""popular delusions and the madness of crowds"" though."
2,"Creative, But Not The Least Bit Scary","I saw this movie with my 12-year-old daughter - a certified fan of horror flicks - and we both came away non-plussed, only slightly amused, but not shocked or scared in any manner.We'd heard great things about this movie and came in with high expectations. Words cannot express the disappointment in this film. There is nothing in this film that could possibly be considered scary. As another reviewer put it, it's better as a comedy than as a horror flick."
2,What?!,"""There was no beer on the island, man. If they had beer they would have had, like, big-ass orgies.""You had beer and there were no orgies. This movie blew (unlike orgies)."
1,Scary? How?,The first movie I ever walked out on was The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This was the second. What a joke.
1,incredibly bad,There are not adequate words to describe how badly this movie sucks.It is not even bad enugh to be good.There is nothing legal you can do for 90 minutes that is as bad as watching this dreck...
1,Nevidjeno glup film!,"Nevidjeno glup film! Prvo, nije uopste scary movie: postoji jedna jedina umereno strasna scena. Would you know it was a scary movie if the media and the ads did not tell you so? Zao mi je bacenih para..."
1,The most boring movie to ever exist.,Please do not wast your money on this movie. It was completely boring. I can't even believe I watched the whole thing. What a dud. Definately the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't believe all the hype about it.
1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"A one star rating is too good for this piece of [junk.] Scary??? When exactly was it even remotely frightening. Boring, yes. Stupid, definitely. Waste of time and money, absolutely!!!!"
2,If you like this movie stop now,"This movie was vaguely frightening which is I suppose the only thing that saves it at all. However once you get over the hype and the motion sickness it all boils down to one thing. Three people ... in the woods. I will make a few allowances for it being a visionary film as far as how it was made, etc. However, If i wanna spend hours listening to people complain. I will go to work. Frankly, after listening to these three whiners for 90 minutes, I was kind of glad when they all bought it in the end."
1,Piece,"Actually, I wish I could give this movie 0 stars, but the Amazon rating scale won't let me! This was suppose to be scary? I simply became sick from all that damn camera shaking. The characters were annoying and the ending was terrible. Anyone could have made this movie. What really makes me angry are the people that acually liked this movie or were scared by it. Are you kidding me? This was about as scary as the Teletubies and less entertaining then watching my families summer picnic video. What a waste of a couple of hours!"
3,Still decent....,"For what it is it still needs to be appreciated. This was a very low budget movie shot documentary style that still serves it purpose today. Since CGI was not used the movie doesn't look as dated, however it is supposed to be dated as it is found footage. Not the best movie ever made but there have been big budget movies that are 100% worse than this little independent gem."
3,Good movie to watch one time,"It's a movie you'll enjoy watching the first time. Although once you've seen it, you won't enjoy it as much the second time around."
3,"Good, but not THAT good!","Not generally a fan of horror films -- especially not ""supernatural"" horror films -- I finally rented both ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""St. Francisville Experiment"" at the same time. The hype over this one is way, WAY over the top, but I was interested in seeing how these films handled their offbeat ""documentary"" approach, and I was satisifed. It takes an awful lot of talent to make even a BAD movie, so I have to give these filmmakers their due -- but not one iota more than they deserve. And to paraphrase Lewis Black: If you saw either one of these movies and, for even one moment, thought that they were ""based on a true story,"" etc. then I want you to wear tinfoil so the rest of us know who you are...."
4,Gripping!,"The homemade feel of this movie is what is needed for a realistic effect, the acting was very good and overall I found the film to be intense, misterious and gripping. Overall: VERY GOOD!"
2,It's not as bad as I thought,"Like most of you, I had been hearing about ""the scariest movie of all time"" when I went to see BWP in the theatres and like most of you, I was extremely dissappointed. But, after seeing it on television a few times, I realized it's not really that bad. There are some truly suspenseful moments. I am a big horror fan and love movies that come up with new and creative ideas, however I would take Freddy Krueger over BWP any day."
2,Way over-rated,"Maybe in a darkened theatre this movie was frightening, but on the home screen it left a lot to be desired. The ending however was done rather well. The guy standing in the corner was a neat flash back to the research they had done before they went and got themselves lost. It gave the movie a sufficiently spooky ending. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
1,The Blair -Yawn- Witch Project,"I had already seen this at the cinema and wasn't really interested in the DVD. I sat down, turned the lights off, hoping to recreate the cinema atmosphere and try to catch the horror i must have missed the first time... something i now regret. Whatever effect (however minimal it was in the first place) this had at the cinema was completely lost on the DVD. It was not scary, it did not seem real at all and the acting was simply ludicrous now that i think about it. I strongly urge any potential buyers to direct their well-earned money towards a better quality movie than this."
1,POSITIVELY THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"I am SOOOO tired of reading all these reviews by people who loved this movie. Not because I wish to deny them of their right to an opinion, but because I take offense to the constant insults to those of us that HATED the movie. Get off your high horses people, if you actually enjoyed this movie then maybe a reality check is in order of YOUR ""intellect and imagination"". I am not a violent person but I wanted the characters to be brutally killed, not because I'm a ""brain-dead suburbanite that was raised to expect blood, gore, and explosions"", I just wanted to shut the VCR off and stop waiting for something remotely interesting to happen. What a complete waste of money. I dont care if its low budget or high budget, amatuer or professional, it simply stunk. Even if I had seen the movie thinking it was a true story, I would have been disgusted."
1,Get lost?,"Three college film students taping a documentary get lost in the woods and record themselves getting picked off one by one by something unknown to the viewer. Massively overhyped film is nothing more than the description above and painful to watch. If you can handle being bored, you're ready for this movie."
4,"Didn't scare me at all in the theater, but later...","Couldn't sleep. Had nightmares when I did. Drove way out of my way to avoid the only woods in this city. Didn't even want to look at my sleeping bag, let alone a flashlight. Terrified of going anywhere in Maryland, which is hard if you live in DC. I'm just glad I saw this AFTER going on my big camping trip for the summer.In the theater I was distracted by the shaky camerawork and the endless bickering. Even the last 10 minutes didn't really scare me -- just seemed a little silly. But afterward, in thinking about it (the great thing is there are a lot of different ways to interpret what happened) and putting it all together? I was scared. The bottom line: it doesn't look great, and there's no slick editing or anything, but if you have half a brain in your head you will be scared."
1,Cliche,"Ok this was bad really bad. I mean first it made me sick watching the damn camera moving around but I would've been able to deal with it if it had an original and scary idea. Jesus Chrimanie how many times have we seen this in horror movies? Three kids get lost in the woods. WHOA call the oscars we have something never seen before!!! They find three stones by there tent. Come on how many people didn't know what that meant? and then how many people didn't see 2 stones popping up after that one guy died???? Those are just 2 of the Cliches. Now about the movie being ""scary"" it wasn't, not in the least. First off the nights were way too frickn' short to be scary, a movie as triveal as Friday the 13th could stretch one single nite into one long movie that had some scares. When this movie gets remotlie interesting they say ""turn off the camera"". that is so retarded and annoying.In short this is not only horrible but it is also a bad horror Cliche that isn't good for ONE fun cheap scare."
1,"Sucks! All marketing fizz, but no goosebumps!","An original marketing plan makes millions, but in relation to the actual film it's not worth buying the video until it's two bucks. It should be rated M, for all marketing but no substance. For people who like horror flicks or even to be scared at movies, you even wait until the end to give the movie a chance, but when you see the closing credits, you get mad at yourself for not leaving sooner."
1,Worst movie ever made,Whats the great sucking noise... its your will to live as you try to stay awake through one of the worst movies ever made. Its only too bad 1 star is as low as it can be rated.
5,Creepy!! I couldn't stop thinking about it!,"It was great to see a horror movie that left a little bit to the imagination. I saw it with three friends, and afterwards, we all came to different conclusions about what the ""Blair Witch"" actually was. I am sure that anyone who's been on a camping trip out in the middle of no-where can relate to the feelings the three characters were experiencing through the course of the movie. This is definitely one to buy and watch over and over again."
1,Surprisingly Overrated.,"While many critics hailed this movie as refreshing and innovative, I had quite the opposite reaction. For me, low budget and independent do not have to be synonymous with complete lack of filmmaking technique, which is what I saw in this grossly overrated film. Examples of films done on a shoestring budget that show dazzingly skillful and inventive technique include ""pi"", Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"", and Michael Almerayda's vampire flick, ""Nadja"". ""Blair Witch"" on the other hand, looked like it could have been made by any minimally competent group of college film students or cable access producers, once given the original premise."
5,Loved it!!,"Here's the bottom line to seeing this movie and enjoying it: use your imagination. People who need their hands held every step of the way and need everything explained to them shouldn't see this movie. For those of us fortunate enough to be open minded and who have thought about the possibilities about what actually goes bump in the night, this is the movie for you. For those critics who have nothing but bad things to say about this movie, keep in mind that you aren't the ones who only spent $30,000 on making this movie and have grossed over a gazillon dollars so far. Money talks...you know what walks... Gotta be something good in the movie if the producers and company have made that much money so far."
2,Not what I expected,"I was a ok movie, it started off rather slow. I was not as scarry as I expected and I was dissapointed. I wll not see this movie again."
1,Far too much hype for far too little of a movie,"I thought the concept was brilliant, and so simple for a Hollywood hit. However, I tired quickly of watching the ground in a truly non-frightening sort of way. I have to admit that at the end I was getting ready to be scared, but ultimately it was just a false alarm. I think that although everyone thinks it's the sacriest movie ""ever,"" there are far more horror flics worth owning."
1,I thought that it was stupid,All can say is that i was very dissappointed with this movie. I really thought that it would make me sit on the edge of my seat and all i could think was that i wanted it to be over.
3,"Sorry, but I just wasn't scared...","I don't usually watch ""scary"" movies because they don't scare me. Given the hype of the BWP I decided to give it a try. But I was never scared, never felt a moment of suspense at all.It was *very* realistic. If I didn't know that the cast was carrying GPS units with them, I would say that there was no doubt they were actually lost. You do feel for these three lost fools, but the movie is not about any Blair Witch; most of the film is about three kids lost in the woods. Yes, the movie gets pretty creepy after Josh disappears, but its never really scary.Actually, the best parts of the movie for me were the funny ones: Heather pushing the camera into the marshmallows (""soft...soft...""); Heather's wet shoes; Mike singing ""God Bless America""...or was it ""America the Beautiful""?This movie was totally over-hyped, though it legitimately breaks new ground in film-making. Sorry, I know you all loved it, but I wasn't very impressed."
5,Scared me sleepless,"I had been following BWP for a few months on the web at their official websites, and I was completely hooked on the brilliant concept that Haxan films came up with. The entire last scene when Mike and Heather go into the house is what completely drew me in and scared me out of my mind. You will either love BWP or hate it.. Skeptics and people who didn't appreciate this movie obviously didn't keep in mind that the whole basis of BWP is psychological suspense, what goes bump in the night and the entire scenario can actually happen in real life (even if it isn't a witch who hunts you down in the woods while on a camping trip). Besides, the film has made over $100 million to date..regardless if you liked the movie or not, the filmmakers have to be doing something right to make that much money!!"
1,A Totally Disappointing Movie.,"I just recently saw this movie and can't believe how overrated it is. The idea behind this movie wasn't bad--it's just that The Blair Witch Project went nowhere and fell flat. I feel that this movie could have been a whole lot better, but my impression is that it was made too quickly or something. Another thing--this picture is not a horror movie, but it tries to be a psychological thriller. I can't say the acting was bad, it's just that The Blair Witch Project has been horribly hyped and overrated. I can honestly say that I didn't get scared even once. The ending to this film was poor also. I felt really cheated. The idea behind this movie wasn't completely bad, it's just that it didn't come off well at all and was a complete waste of time. Not recommended."
1,Boredom Witch Project,"What an overrated peice of trash. The acting was terrible, and the 5 min. of ''pure terror'' were actually quite funny."
4,good?,"It seems that the majority of the people who go to see this movie are in love with it's premise. It is a pretty cool premise, but if anyone out there reading this has not seen the movie yet, do not get your hopes up too high. The acting is exagerated to the point of being hard to watch and the middle of the film drags like a turtle pulling a semi. It was really cool to see and indie movie make it this big, but once again the hype machine that is our society blew this film way our of the scope in which I think it was intended. With that said, the end of this movie is in fact really cool and truly scary. The last ten minutes will make you wonder why the rest of the film couldn't have been that good. Cause the end was really good. The closing images will stay with you for days, but unfortuntaly so will the naseau-inducing acting of Heather Donahue"
2,dissappointed,"I knew this movie, and I use that term losely, was not that long, but when I first watched it, I kept waiting for it to get scary. The wait was in vain. I have to give it credit for its originality in the style that it was filmed, and the improptu dialogue, though I thought Eddie Murphy might have had a hand in the writting since only his movie seem to have the f-word as much as this did. Scary...not in the least bit. A good movie....not very. But for those looking for something, though not exactly sure what that something is, this is an ok watch."
1,Save your time and your money,"Unfortunately I succumbed to the hype and paid good money for the DVD version.....what a waste! The only thing that should have died was the batteries for their cameras. How did they manage to last so long, anyway? My VCR camera only last about half an hour...and that would have been too long to endure watching this rubbish! If they were finding it hard to sleep at night out in the woods, they could have just watched this and it would certainly have done the trick."
4,Scary And Disturbing,"Three filmstudents go out into the woods near Burkittsville to film a documentary on the urban legend of the Blair Witch. The deeper they venture into the woods, the more they encounter which gives evidence that the Blair Witch may be real. This independent film did very well in theatres considering that it had a budget of $35,000 and made $50,000,000 on the first week of release. This movie goes from the typical stage of surprise scary to chilling scary. A movie that everybody should have a look at."
4,Scary as hell....,"Wow! This movie was a scary one. This shows another power of Indy movies. The way the directors show the footage was so real. That was scary..... Some people say that this movie was a sick movie, but I understand it. I was dizzy, but it was so scary I almost pissed on my pants! The real horror is after you see it. Flix like Scream or other slasher films make some instant thrills, but it gives you nothing after. Just an entertaining film. But movies like The Exorcist or The Blair Witch Project will leave the horror in your memories.I personally think that it was the scariest film since The Exorcist. On top of that, look at the budget! The movie director who made a movie which starts with the letter 'T' and ends with a 'C', should look and learn. This film proves that movies require more skills than a famous director, actor, or a high budget."
1,Over-hyped; not worth the admisson price.,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, however, it just did not live up to the hype. It was not scary, and the 3 students were so annoying that it was hard to care about what happened to them. At the end of the film, I just sat in my seat and said to myself, ""This CAN'T be the end."" A big disappointment."
4,One of its kind,"As many would say, the less you know about the movie, the better. And it certainly lives up to its reputation and tagline. The directors have done a pretty good job of ""editing"" the footages together. It would have been a better effort if the ending was improved."
1,awful insult,This is an awful insult to any viewer's intelligence. All the numb-skulls had to do was follow the stream. I can't believe anyone with an IQ above a rabid baboon could like this. They must not have had anything to do in the day or two it must have taken to film this thing.
1,A VERY Sorry Movie....,"Extremely anticlamactic... I expected so much more from this movie. Especially with all the additional information provided with the DVD, the final scene is dissapointing... watch a real mind numbing movie like THE MATRIX..."
3,"Eeek. Steady cam, please!","I put off seeing this for months because of the hype--and I'm not a fan of horror flicks. But--! If the purpose of scarey movies is to freak a person out, this did the job on me. Didn't sleep at night for two nights running. One question...Who or WHAT the heck was running the camera at the very end? H'm? That is what absolutely chilled me to my marrow. Check it out--or be the last person on the face of the planet besides my husband who hasn't seen it."
1,Don't my time,"The only good part about this movie, was the ending...you knew it was finally over PLEASE...three people freaking in the woods....pick up a stick and start hitting people, how hard is that, end of story, never let a girl lead the way :)"
5,a masterwork,"The most un nerving film i have ever saw..No one in a ski mask,no slashers placing an icepick thru someones forehead,just pure unimplied terror.The night scenes where you can hear the dead children giggling is creepy as all get out.The final scene with Heather screaming like a banshee is all i needed.I didnt feel the need to see a ""witch""...A truly masterful film"
1,"Hype, Not Horror","Well, the movie is...okay. It really isn't scary, but the acting is incredible. Be warned, the constant camera shaking can make you sick. I would rent it, but I wouldn't buy it."
5,One of the scariest films i have ever seen,"This is without a doubt one of the scariest films i have ever seen, i am scared even to go walking in the woods at day time, and won't even set foot in them at night, and when it is night time and i think about the ending of this movie i still get shivers"
2,Novelty,"How Hip! Having seen the movie in its limited run before it went nationwide, before the media latched on, I was neither disappointed or impressed. What leaved a dry taste in my mouth is the ""Gee, aren't we clever!"" aspect of the whole production. It isn't revolutionary, I could point a video camera into the darkness and shout""OH MY GOD THERE IT IS THERE IT IS!!!!"" But then again maybe I would get caught up in plot. I do credit this film for returning its viewers to an age old idea: Your brain is scarier than what your eyes. How cute. I also credit the filmmakers (One of which ran off with about $39,000) for a very savvy marketing effort. The bottom line, while not revolutionary, it was a good ride. I just resent the endless self crongratulation of cleverness. C'MON IT WASN""T THAT ORIGINAL OF AN IDEA. Savvy marketing, Gen-Y Appeal."
3,Okay,"First of all, I didn't think that the movie was that great...slightly scary, but very predictable. The other reason I gave it 3 stars is that, unlike 'The Matrix' or 'The Sixth Sense', there is no reason that you need to see it more than once (unless you really love it). The extra features aren't great. It has audio commentary by the directors, a few minutes of extra film, and a TV documentary. I'd say save your money and watch it on Showtime/HBO/Cinemax."
2,"Sorry, I just wasn't impressed!","There really isn't much for me to say about this movie. Three college students go into the woods investigating the Blair Witch. Unfortunately the audience isn't given enough information on the Blair Witch to understand what makes the legend so intriguing.I can appreciate the way it was filmed. There were times when it seemed like you were watching an actual documentary rather than a movie. I can also appreciate that, unlike most films, you are not readily presented with what you are supposed to fear. A good job was done of presenting an atmosphere. There was no ""horror movie formula"" being followed, which made the outcome unpredictable.I guess my problem was that I didn't enough of a connection with the characters to care whether they lived or died. All I saw was two male brats led by an arrogant female brat. Their favorite word is the ""F"" word. They have no idea how to navigate through the woods. They scream, they yell, they die. End of story!"
1,Why wasn't the witch ever seen?,I thought the movie was a little boring. The which was never seen through the whole movie. You never saw anyone die. Plus I got sick because the camera was shaking to much.
2,What was the hype about??,"I heard all the hype about this movie, how scary it was. The REAL movie was a real letdown.....i didn't think it was scary at all. Yeah, it was definately creepy, but i wouldn't consider it a horror movie. Plus, it got kinda boring just watching them wander around for an hour. And the ending kinda sucked, i wish they would've filled it in somehow. Overally, this movie really isn't worth spending the money on. Rent it, before you spend $ on it."
4,A film that puts many high budget films to shame,This was a very well edited picture and I believe that it is due to the editing that made this picture so realistic. I am more delighted that this picture put many of the high budget horror films to shame. It just goes to show that with a little ingenuity and imagination filmakers can still strike a cord with the audience. To many filmakers are out for the big dollar and lose the artistic quality that makes movies memorable.
2,Big disappointment after all the hype,"If I were 10 years old I'm sure this would make me afraid to go to sleep with the light off. But I'm not, and even though I have quite a good imagination I don't think I should have to imagine myself scared! Now, if one could really believe these were authentic videos found after three people disappeared.... that'd be a whole 'nother story!"
1,Francis Bacon,Gave up on this one. Didn't understand the vernacular of the writer. Maybe I will try again in the future.
5,*****,"I'ma keep this short and sweet. This album is incredible, from start to finish, mindblowing lyrics, and bugged out beats. Standout tracks are ""super pretzel diplomacy"", and ""brave new world"". DO NOT SLEEP, if you appreciate quality underground hip hop pick this up ASAP"
4,Item is grossly overpriced,"The scope works fine. No problems sighting in, or with maintaining accuracy. However, Bass Pro Shops sells the IDENTICAL scope under the ""Redhead"" brand name for $39.99. I purchased the Redhead scope for another weapon. The scopes, when held side by side, are identical, except for the brand name."
5,real country music,"from a bygone era. I can't stop listening to this cd. Todays country music is pale and shameful when compared to true artistry such as showcased on this collection. The first ten songs alone are worth the cost, buy it before its gone!!! Masterful."
5,Cute penguin,"I bought this penguin for a 3 year old. It was much bigger then I thought it was when it arrived. BUT...it made for a wonderfully big surprise! My niece that loves penguins just loved it. It became the ""mommy penguin"" of the little one she also recieved for her birthday."
3,#11 Xacto blades,"Standard Xacto #11 blades now apparently manufactured in China, but appear to be quality and maintain sharpness. Time will tell if product quality holds true."
1,Forced to Watch Commercials!,"After you pay for this DVD you are FORCED (no way to bypass them) about 1.5 minutes of commercials for things like OXO, All-Clad and so on. Ridiculous! If you paid for it you paid for it.The rest of it is tiny clips from her old shows interspersed with fairly obvious comments from people of today like Martha ""Jailbird"" Stewart, Alice Waters, and so on.Save your money. Get the book version instead."
2,mistake,"This book is a good book,but I bought the wrong book for my class.In my opinion ,This book has a lot of useful practice in order to help you learn more about statistic."
1,Not for me,"I used this last night and it hurt my face, this morning my face was very itchy and I used it again tonight and it just burned my face, I look horrible, my face is so red and swollen it hurts, burns and itches so bad.I only use organic product for everything and I had no problem with beauty juice so I won't use this again.And I don't have sensitive skin besides there were some ingredient in it that just don't convince me at all.The shipping was horrible it took forever and the gel was open and the gel was all over the package, horrible shipping someone just put in bag and send it."
4,awsome gun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is an awsome gun. it is my first marker, but dont take me wrong because im a beginner. it is very accurate, POWERFUL! it chops from time to time though. it also doesnt have anti double feed. but it is quickly backed up when my friends scream when they've been hit in the back. buy this gun!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,An internal battle against drugs...,"Quitting (Zuotian) is a film about Hongshen and his addiction to drugs. Hongshen, a former actor, lives in an apartment complex which he seldom leaves. The family finds out about his drug addiction and decides to move to where he lives and try to help him. However, this seems to tear the family apart and there seems to be no way out other than to institutionalize Hongshen for his drug addiction. Quitting is a narrative of Hongshen's life that grabs the audience with a serious undertone, but occasionally is playful through the characters that Hongshen meets through his habit. The film is an interesting contemporary Chinese film that entertains while offering a lot of food for the mind."
1,Another One Of Those Movies That End Up Collecting Dust In Peoples Attics...,"Quitting.... hmmm doesent seem to ring a bell but now that you mention it.... Ah yes the movie about some crappy chinese actor who smokes herion and listened to one beatles album for a year.... Uhhhh exact reason why he listens to one album for a whole year is beyond me and what the heck was his point of doing heroin anyways i mean he was an actor so why was he depressed. I watched about a minute of it an hated it, so yeah this dvd is crap and will never be good"
3,It's not John Lennon's Fault,"This is a good movie (not a great movie). My main complaint is that it feels like typical Chinese propaganda that all their problems (like drug addition) is the fault of Western influences. I felt the movie repeatedly implicated the western rock and roll influence with causing the drug addition of the main character. On the other hand, another Chinese offer him drugs the first time. So my accusation is debatable -- but I definitely felt it. There was probably something lost in the translation, too. For example, the chorsu line from ""Let it be"" by the Beatles was translated to ""Be natural."" This slightly off translation made following the subtitles a little more difficult than subtitles in French or Spanish movies....I don't see how the Beatles (""peace, love, and understanding"") can be blamed. Do you?"
3,"The Christopher Lee story, or, ""I am not Dracula""","Christopher Lee tells about his career in motion pictures, but of course the interesting parts are where he talks about playing Dracula and the problems he had with Hammer Studios. Having seen all of the Hammer Dracula movies it is easy for me to understand why Lee felt frustrated in the role. The character was reduced to being so animalistic; in some films he never even speaks. This autobiography makes it clear Lee could have done much more with the role (and actually got the chance to do so, but in a film made after this book was published). Certainly an interesting book for Lee's fans, but hopefully they will end up with more of an appreciation for the man's entire career in acting."
5,Wow,"Just read Blazing Fury and can't wait to read the first, Absolute Fury! I read Blazing Fury in two nights. I was so scared I woke my husband up to go to the bathroom with me! I am hoping this is an A through Z series."
4,"Great pictures from 1819 to 1969, not so great 1970 to 2000",This is a thick picture book of Singapore gone by. The pictures are organised chronologically. There are some great aerial maps from the 1950s.The key weakness is 1970 to 2000. Pictures are not very good. Especially for newcomers to Singapore it is fun to see how Singapore has changed in the last couple of decades as well.I can recommend this book to people who move to Singapore and would like to get a visual history of how this island looked in years gone by.
5,A childhood favorite,"My siblings and I grew up with this book! My nephew's nickname to this day (and he's 24!!) is Boodleheimer! I love this book, and have searched for a copy for years - my mother even called Stoo Hample to see if he had an old copy sitting around! (He didn't) The recipe for spaghetti, the poems, the outright silliness of it will make anyone smile! As a teacher, a collector of children's literature, and as an adult with many happy memories of hours spent reading and re-reading this book, I highly recommend this silly book!"
5,It's back! It's back!,"Woo hoo! What a classic. The Silly Book is good clean fun, and of course very silly. So... where's the old Silly Record? Or will it be reissued as a Silly CD?"
2,Didn't quite make it's potential.,"This is a book where the main characters rent apartments in the same house, and over the first half of the book they get to know each other. It is a little dragged out and slow. I think this could have been done in a couple of chapters, then the daughter comes on the secene. After the little girl comes into the picture is when the book actually becomes very good, but it doesn't leave much time till the end of the book, which leaves a lot of questions unanswered.This is the first in a series of three books about three college roommates, which was not elaborated upon in this book. I just hope the next two books will stick more to their titles than this one did."
3,and on and on...,"Casanova's life was amazing, with enough adventure and intrigue to fill... well... volumes and volumes of text. Unfortunately, that's exactly what he decided to do, and while much of it is interesting and involving, after a while I just kept saying 'how much longer does this go on?' Certainly worth reading, but pace yourself or your head will go numb."
3,"nice sweet, but kind of dull","I love time travel, but the story is kind of dull in this book. Author David Williams has a hard time getting into the true psyche of what a woman thinks and feels. Still a fun read, and not very long.. if you can afford the out of print prices for the book, or find it at the library!"
5,A great sell for Sellers alone,"Cheesy title, I know, but the aforementioned poor audio quality and lack of special features simply don't take away from the biggest selling feature of this DVD: Peter Sellers. I love John Cleese, and Dudley Moore is also talented man, but of the 3 episodes on here, Peter Sellers simply shines. Must be seen."
4,So many memories!,"I bought this as a gift for my four year old nephew. I didn't know who would like it more, him or his mom. As it turns out the whole family has enjoyed it, especially my 8 year old nephew. Some reviews mentioned that the kids don't enjoy it because they don't know who the guest hosts are but I have to say in our case that wasn't an issue. Actually I'm pretty sure I had no idea who Peter Sellers was when the show originally aired. It is a classic for the whole family to enjoy."
3,"Great shows, poor quality DVD","Since Childhood I have loved the Muppet Show (never missed one!) so I was very excited to start my daughter on the show. The material of Jim Henson can't be matched but I was SO dissappointed with the Quality of the DVD. I can barely get the thing to play, and when it does play there are several skips and digital ""mess ups"" throughout the DVD. I thought it was just a bad copy so I bought another brand new one only to experience the same problems, next time I'll go back to good ole video!"
3,Trying Too Hard,I was disappointed in Milk. I did not find any of the three main characters believable or likeable. I felt that the author was trying way too hard to shock readers with her prose and wasn't too successful at that. She was trying to created something that wasn't there. A big disappointment.
4,Great Xmas Gift for the Cook,Was nicely made - good size and great for the guy who cooks everything spicy hot.
2,Poor writing,"The plot is actually rather interesting, but then the writing is rather poor. Jennifer Cloud does not have a huge future, though she did have a interesting plot in this one. The characters though don't make very much sense at all. Craig is very poorly written. He's suppossed to be insane I guess, but he's too reasonable for that throughout, and he's too stupid to have any feelings for. The protagonist, James, is rather poorly written himself. Julie is probably the only mildly interesting character in the novel, but she doesn't fill as many pages as the other two. Overall, good premise, bad book."
5,2nd to last expansion comin witha grand BANG!,"As you all know, the sims makin magic is the 2nd to last expasion pack until the sims 2. (the last is the sims bustin' out expasion pack look it up!) From what ive read it seems like a five star to me! of course none of us have played it yet but us simaholics, masters and luvers of this addictive startegy game, have a feeling this ones gonna go poof on the racks at wal*mart! I cannot wait for this one to come out! Ive already planned a family and bulit a hous efor them, But i didnt do anything but just make walls cuz this is agains upposed to bring alot of dungeon/cellar like floors and walls and landscaping will be themed as autum. well taihts! We will never know until we play cya!"
2,BE PATIENT AND WAIT A BIT LONGER!!!!!!!!,EA has made alot of expansion packs for the Sims this one doesent seem to much fun. the main turn off is that there coming out with a game called the sims 2 in febuary and it suppost to be much better than all the other sim games. So y buy another expnsion pack for $30 when your just going to unistall it to make room for the Sims 2 in Febuary.
4,As Fun As in Harry Potter,"I read and watched Harry Potter series. One day this expansion pack is available on the game shop. I bought this expansion pack and installed it. It is just as fun as I tought before!I can learn spells, cast it to objects or even myself. :D I can go to secret shops in a Mystery Town and buy odd ingredients needed in my mixture. When I have time, I went to the Mystery Town via special hole in my backyard and I played some games there. I can also meet other wizards and have some battles with them.New clothes, furnitures, objects, and some other stuff are included in this expansion pack, making it possible for me to create my own Castile. :D I use stonewall wallpaper to wrap all my walls, plant some old-abandoned-well and dead oak tree, use antigue doors and windows, and select 'magic and ancient' furnitures instead the ordinary. I just love it! XD"
4,AWESOME!!!!!,This expansion pack was what I needed to get my Sims' on!!!! Thanks again for the awesome price on this game too!! Keep up the good work!
5,My favorite Sims Expansion Pack.,"As you can guess from the title, this EP gives your Sims the ability to practice magic. It's pretty harmless stuff like turning a Sim temporarily into a frog or making a mood enhancing charm or an invisible friend for a Sim chid. It's not anything too scary. No devil worship or the occult here. It is rated Teen, after all.If you still have the original Sims game, I highly recommend this EP. If you don't, a far better choice is the Sims Complete Collection which is compatible with Windows XP (not sure about Vista) and comes with every Sims expansion pack. I play the Sims 2 on my desktop which has a much larger hard drive and faster processor. I play the Sims Complete Collection on my laptop and it works really well for me."
2,One too many,"I trust EA with making excellent games, but even I can't help but wonder if this was a high-concept attempt at a Harry Potter cash-in. If you're a die-hard Potter fanatic, this expansion might appeal to you, but a lot of people don't like the fact that the series has gone in the opposite direction of an everyday-life simulator.After Unleashed (the best expansion IMO) the game takes a solid five minutes to start up and will take up multiple gigs of hard drive space. And that's assuming you haven't downloaded any fan-created content from the web.Makin' Magic is not an great expansion, but it's decent for adding a couple more hours onto a franchise well past its prime. With The Sims 2 on its way, there's not much reason to spend money on Makin' Magic. I'm an unabashed Sims fan, but after seven expansions it's time to stop."
3,It alright.,"My cousin has this one. Its really really really fun for a while, but like most games it gets boring after that. Each expansion pack adds more fun to the game, but if you have all of them and/or you cheat on the game and/or you have just had it for a [LONG] time, then it gets boring. I'm not saying anything against this game, I love it, but 1-Its hard to get the right potions to be able to make kool spells. 2-If you have been a complete simslover ever since it came out or even later and have gotten every expansion or close to every one then by the time you get makin magic(...).the game gets(...).well(...).BORING! But still i can see how it would be fun if you just started playing sims. Its a cool game and I admire the Sims Creators for their Creativity."
3,Not the best Sims expansion...,"I found magic to be very inconvenient and expensive to use. As in all other Sim games, it is hard to keep your Sim happy for more than a few days, and also make enough money to live off of. It is only fun to go to a premade house and play with the premade sims, but that's not the point of the game..."
3,listen up,this game is pure evil.for those christians this would not be a game to buy.you can raise people from the dead and everything.mixing up magic too.but magic town is alwesome!!!!!!!!!!!
1,THIS GAME SUKS,"I have,nt had a chance to play this game because it keeps quiting before it gets to the neighborhood.I have been dying to get this game but when i do it keeps quiting on me i,ve heard that this is a good game but EA GAMES U COULD HAVE DONE BETTER!!!!!"
4,Fun but advertising was misleading,"If the television commercials for this expansion pack are to be believed, then my Sims should now be able to get some double penetration action in Makin' Magic. Unfortunately, this was not implemented in the actual game. I feel cheated."
4,Best EP yet but its kinda conufusing,"This is the 3rd EP i've gotten and it's the best! who needs unleashed when you van get a pet dragon? who needs Vaction or Hot Date when you can go to magic town instead? the spells are a bit hard to find so it takes a while but, apart from that it rocks!"
5,feedforward amplifier for imt2000,adative feedforward control circuit & feedforwrd linear power amplifier for IMT2000
1,The worst I've heard in a long time...,"Because I am a merciful man, I am giving this release 1 star.This is the worst garbage I've heard in a very long time. Jess Cox could never, and will never be able to sing."
2,Get 45/45 not 90/90,I love everything Pole does.. except this one. It's like a bad Massive Attack single. The other album 45/45 is very cool though.
1,misleading,"i doubt proof reading was done. poor grammar, poor spelling, conflicting calculationone chapter for example say aids is more a chronic sickness because 0% aids patient live 8 to 10 yrs. how can it be 0%. one section says inr is 2 to 3 another section says it is 2 to 4.5, one section says normal platelet count is 1400000 to 440000 next section says it 130000 to 330000 the list of conflicting info goes on and on. i have done medical studies before and this book will let you kill patient. IT IS MISLEADING DUMB BOOK. PLEASE SPENT TIME and GET the FACT STRAIGHT AND PROOFREAD.THIS BOOK IS TOTAL TRASH AND SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKED AND REVISED ."
1,conflictions,"This book is horrible, It states in chapter 3 pg 43 Edema is caused by body's ability to pass water and sodium to excrete has failed, which would be noticed for hypernatremia, but on pg 45 hyponatremia, the book basically says hyponatremia is the cause of edema. it says next paragraph on pg 46 that hypernatremia is results of dehydration, mentions nothing edema. i confirmed from google, hypernatremia is the cause of edema, limit salt intake and fluids, but the book says hypo and you limit fluids and sodium.the instructors said there is lots of conflicts with this book, they are right.It doesnt even mention Hyperkalemia tx kalexate causes stool to change color.also, it mentions pancrease po but not mentioned you have to take with your food in Cystic fibrosis.if your school uses this book, just know, they are setting you up to fail, you will notice your instructors using other sources if information, because Evolve sucks! i dont know anyone who passed nclex by using evolve text materials."
1,You'll have a tough time aiming...,"I bought this game for a relative this xmas and it was very disappointing. The xbox and playstation 2 versions are very intuitive and easy to pick up, but the pc version makes it very tough to aim. It is so tough that if I could, I would return it."
2,Great Game,"I say its a great game, if you like golf. Great price and always good doing business with amazon.."
4,Tiger Woods rocks!!,I have not played any earlier versions of this game and keep kicking myself as to why not!!!Its an absolutely wonderful game ... its very realistic especially in the most advanced level. Loved the number of different courses that are on offer especially St. Andrews and Pinehurst #2
2,Not like the Picture here,The Kettle in the picture here is not the one that is sent. I bought this for the low pitched train-like whistle (note the multiple holes on the spout cover). The Kettle shipped was a single holed cover and the handle set up was also different.
1,"Disgusting, cruel, unfunny book","I guess the author thought his subjects were funny--disabled people, sick people, people dying. If so, he's the only one. I finished the book only to see if it could get even worse, the writing so sloppy, the characters tinny, and the situations entirely cruel in their exaggeration. I couldn't find one single insight into gay life (or any life) that makes this book worth keeping, and I didn't."
5,Great Fun!,"I do not really believe in re-incarnation, but I heard good things about this book, so I read it. It was fun reading all those wonderful adventure stories, and maybe, I should believe in it. Bryan obviously has lots of knowledge in this field. I am glad I read it. It was very enjoyable."
3,False Impressions,"The editorial review of this book wrote:""Bryan also shares a proven technique his readers can use to turn their past-life curses into present-life blessings.""The title 'Healing The Soul Through NON-HYPNOTIC REGRESSION' along with the editorial promise, is a blatant lie. The only thing proven in this book was that the 'hypnotic technique' was not proven, which was the reason I had bought the book. What was shared was countless accounts of how past life regression helps solve personal problems faced by some today, which in itself is interesting, but not what the book promised. The technique shared in this book was to 'let the pain, anger etc.', be discarded into the 'light'. And that was the extent of it.I was very disappointed that I had to be tricked into buying a book that promised 'shared technique', there was NO sharing involved here."
2,How do I do non-hypnotic regression? You won't find out here,"Like many, many other books about past-life regression, this book has fascinating stories and anecdotes on reincarnation. It also offers a spiritual outlook on understanding reincanation and or karma. However, there is not one word on techniques or how non-hypnotic regression is actually experienced. (if you are interested in this approach more experientially look for the writings of Morris Netherton). I find this the only major lack in this generally well written book."
5,I love Agatha Christie,This book is another great book from Agatha...several different stories all of them capture your attention with suspense and interest
4,Great recipes,"These recipes really are quick and easy---and healthy on top of it. I mentioned some of the recipes I had tried to one of my friends, and she has ordered the cookbook. Since I recently was diagnosed with high cholesterol, I decided it was time healthier, and this cookbook is really helping!"
4,"quick, easy & healthy cooking",The book was very helpful I used it for a healthy cooking class and we used several recipes for the cooking class.
5,Amazing recipes,"Contains amazing recipes that are healthy and delicious, and also fit in with some well-known diets (e.g. South Beach)."
4,Delicious,The recipes in this book are so delicious that it is hard to believe that they are healthier for you.
4,Yep it's Easy,It is simple a good heart healty recipes. It is defintaly a good one to add with your other cookbooks.
3,no pictures,Book needs pictures for high school students to see what the recipe will look like when made.
4,This is a great book,"I have to give it 4 stars because it doesn't have any pictures. I am basically a picture person - I like to see what the end result should look like.I have tried other low fat cook books before and have been alittle disappointed with them all. I found only a few recipes that I ended up liking and still occasionally use. I tried have tried 5 recipes from this book so far, and so far they have been very good.The recipes have plenty of seasoning in them so they don't taste bland. And some of the recipes are common sense ones that use the old rule of substitution ie - instead of oil use apple sauce, instead of sour cream use fat free yogurt etc.In any case this book is definately a good buy at a good price. I would definately recommend it."
3,good recipes but no pictures,"These recipes are great and healthful. The lack of pictures is a negative. It would be nice to see how the finished dish is supposed to look.In addition, the nutritional breakdown is nice, but the book does not tell you what constitutes a serving size so that makes knowing the number of calories/fat/carbs useless."
1,Maby in Europe but not here,"I bought this cd reading all the reviews below and there is some talent but not much. Ilonas cd is full of bloop. The tracks are boaring and overswept with simple keyboard sweeps and scapes and already heard beats. The vocals are well crafted with an excellent range but not my cup of tea. Lacking in music production talent! My suggestion for you, Ilona, is to use better producers for your next production and let them take you were you need to go just while you simply stick with the singing."
5,Facinating fun,"I really enjoyed the tales in this book about Bhutan, which although starting to have dealings with the outside world is still a very different society.The most interesting aspect was how corrupt some of the small time burocrats in the main city of Thimpu were. I will never complain about the DMV again. In some stories you read about civil servants who are fairly high up in the society and how they are dealing with office polotics such as being followed and spied on to ensure that they aren't saying anything against the King. In another story you will read about a nomadic family living high up in the mountains that will come dowon once in a season to buy necessities by trading butter made of Yaks milk, stored in a Yak Bladder. The conflict between the two societis can be seen in that when one of the nomads goes into the city everybody opens windows when they enter a room or tries to sit far away. a FACINATING and entertaining read."
4,Sensitive stories about Buddhist culture,"These six short stories by Thomas Slocum provide a thoughtful window into the lives of ordinary Bhutanese people, their tolerance of each other and their acceptance of life's trials. I found the stories moving and revealing of a culture very different from my own. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who would like to be introduced to a different world view."
2,Confusing,"Property is a difficult subject, therefore, any casebook on the matter should be clear. This casebook, on the other hand, did more harm than good. Every case was followed up by questions with a list of cases to ""see."" Most first year law students have hundreds of pages to read every week and will never refer to these other cases. Thus, these questions (which are worded rather obscurely, I might add. The notes seem to be in another language: Latin) are never answered by the student. With a subject like property, it would be more helpful for the casebook to have more straightforward explanations to accompany the cases, as in Singer's casebook"
4,Lee Harvey Oswald,I liked this book. It was very informative. I especially like the pictures that helped to tell the story of his life and the places that he had gone.
4,"Raw, Powerful Chicago-Style Blues from Detroit","Tough Harp, singing and Guitar work throught this fine disc. Rough and tumble Blues of the type you might hear at a neighborhood joint on a Saturday night. Flat Down On My Back and Don't Kick Me To The Curb are personal favorites. Recommended."
4,The Shah !!,"I don't remember who told me about Harmonica Shah, or when.....but I am glad they did. This is a strong CD, in the Chicago style. Great vocals, a lot of harmonica, and a good backing band. This is my favorite CD by Harmonica Shah, particularly the track 'Flat Down On My Back'."
5,Best shoes I ever bought from the Web!,I was a little skeptical about buying shoes off of the Internet (when I couldnt try them on first. But these shoes fit like a glove the moment I put them on. They are so comfortable even after 12 hours on my feet (for my job). And they so stylish too. But these now!
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I purchased a pair of these Adidas men's size 8 1/2. They fit fine and I like the way they look. However when I first put them on, both shoes, but particularly the right foot was very uncomfortable. The problem was that they hurt the arch of my foot. I know that some shoes need a break in period, so I've been wearing them as much as I can. Now after about 3 weeks, they are better but the right foot is still uncomfortable. It feels like it is pressing up against the arch of my foot, and it really is kind of painful. I really like Adidas, but unfortunately I can not recommend these sneakers, because they remain uncomfortable."
2,Comfortable enough but not even worth the cheap price,"I should have known better when I bought these. I guess part of the blame lies with me because I was looking for a cheap tennis shoe and I got what I paid for. They're comfortable enough, I guess, but I couldn't play tennis in them more than once because they soles were almost completely smooth after playing in them. I was sliding all over the court. Not good and I haven't worn them since.If you're just looking for a shoe to wear around casually, these would be fine. If you're looking for a shoe to actually play tennis in, definitely look elsewhere."
1,Low Quality Shoes,"I don't expect that these shoes made by Adidas are such low quality. They didn't last for a month. After wearing a few times for playing tennis, a hole has already developed in the left toe's area, cheap rubber bottom."
1,Low quality shoes,"I had the same problem as several people before me - after 10-12 matches the front part of the right shoe worn out and the hole in the sole started developing. This is definitely below my expectations since my previous Adidas tennis shoes lasted for almost two years.The shoes were on a heavier side, but size was not a problem, I got the shoes 1/2 size bigger than I normally buy.My advice - don't buy these shoes!"
1,Terrible durability,"These shoes are absolutely awful and would never get them again. I play doubles and was only able to use them in three matches before my foot ripped through the front. Absolute garbage, do not get"
3,Nick hornby writes about different things,"When I read About a Boy and High Fidelity I felt that Nick Hornby was writing to people in thier 20's and 30's who are single. In how to be good I found him to be writing to a different audience, as he has aged so have his topics. Instead of writing about single life and the drama that occurs there, he writes about the problems of family life.While not necessarily targetted at me this book was very funny. At times I laughed outloud at some of the absurdity that took place.I would reccomend this book for it is very good. It is different than both High Fidelity and about a boy."
4,"Good, but not his best.","I'm a big fan of Nick Hornby, but this book is a little bit of a downer. It's a decent book and it's well written, like his others, but the subject matter is a little depressing. It's worth reading, but don't expect to feel warm fuzzies afterwards."
1,yawn. snore. How to be Bored.,"Nick Hornby has shown that once you get famous, you can get anything published and favorably reviewed by the media mafia. This book was truly boring, hard to believe it was written by the author of High Fidelity. Reminded me of having to sit through a two hour sermon."
1,How to be dull,"There should be a general rule among book shoppers that whenever the publisher puts the single word ""Hilarious!"" as a testimonial on the front cover, keep shopping.In ""How to be Good,"" I made it through about 100 pages of the kind of writing that I imagine is produced by an author with no real ideas but a bagful of antidepressants. No hilarity. A main character who is tedious, dishonest and selfish, and not in a funny sort of way.No reason to turn the page."
1,Waste of a read.,"Oh, dear. One of the world's best writers, perhaps believing his own publicity and infallibility, puts out an absolute stinker that would not be published if it was by anyone else. Don't bother, you'd be wasting your time. I highly recommend any book by this author BUT this one..."
2,Sitcoms do it better,"Really deserves one star. The kind of ""perverse"" reversal that occurs in this piece of nonsense has been done before--namely all or most at least of the Britcoms that I have seen over the years. Problem is they do it so much better. If anyone recalls ""The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin"" I'm sure you'll understand what I am talking about. In fact I believe the author of those books was someone named David Nobb. But after the Monty Pythons and some of the others --in fact even Americans are doing it better, eg. The Simpsons and Larry David. . . how can anyone think this book so funny?"
2,Indulgent,"This was an interesting premise, and in some cases very funny. But it raved on too much. I understand that Hornby was trying to get across some deep ideas, but a good storyteller will do that though the story. There was too much inner monologue here. However, the description of a long marriage was good, if a bit depressing."
2,A letdown,"I've had bad luck with Hornby. I became familiar with him through movie adaptions of his earlier work. They were excellent movies with characters I liked and related to, so I can only assume they are based on very fine novels. This led me to pick up the next Hornby book that came along. The premise appealed to me and I was entertained by this book's opening pages, but as it moved along it seemed Hornby had less and less to say and nowhere else to go with the plot. His breezy writing style made this book easy enough to read so I did make it through to the end. But I was sad to have been introduced to the prose of such an obviously talented writer by such a forgettable novel. No doubt he has more top notch books left in him, but this one certainly won't be the novel to base his eventual legacy on."
1,"deathly dull, thin as paper","What a disappointment. Reads like Nick Hornby wrote this over a weekend. Paper thin and very uninvolving. It isn't funny, or particularly knowing. Don't waste your money."
3,"The Modern, Over-observed Life","Hornby shows us what's rushed in to fill the spiritual vacuum left by waning Christianity: careerism, ""new age-ism,"" nihilism, and, more than anything, an ineffable yearning for meaning and connection.There are plenty of laughs along the way, and ideas that rate consideration, but the unbelievable characters undermine the effort."
2,Who are you and what did you do with Nick Hornby,"I adored High Fidelity and About a Boy. Hornby is a genius at drawing characters who are lovable despite their flaws--because, let's face it, most of us are flawed and hope to be loved anyway. Yet with Katie Carr, Hornby has managed to paint a character completely devoid of feeling and totally self-absorbed. She hates her husband, yet won't leave him and continues to belittle him every chance she gets. Does she stay with him for the sake of the children? I wonder, since she seems to dislike her children as well. While funny in parts (parts that are few and far between), How to Be Good left me depressed and wishing for the old Nick Hornby, author of books that are seriously funny, hopeful, and believable."
3,Not Nick's Best,"This one is better than the average novel, but pales in comparison to Nick Hornby's other fare. I can't really imagine this one being made into a movie, although it likely will be. Starts out funny, but becomes somewhat preachy and misses its mark. The characters aren't quite as believeable as Hornby's other ones, likely because he is trying to write from a woman's viewpoint and is out of his element. Read this one after you have loved all of Hornby's other novels and be mildly entertained but somewhat disappointed."
2,Dissapointment,I have truly enjoyed Nick Hornby's other tales but this one killed me. It would have been a lot better if it were about 100 pages shorter. By the end I lost track of the characters and storyline and just felt like I was being preached to. Too bad - my recommendation is to read About A Boy and High Fidelity.
1,Terrible book!,"A very talented author strays out of his comfort zone, and the results are lousy. Paper-thin characters, implausible plot - in short, a waste of time. All his books before this one, however, I'd highly recommend."
2,It's as lame as the title,"Compared to Hornby's other books, which I really liked, it's not very good, or very funny or really ANYTHING. It just sort of blends in with the other books I've read. It doesn't stand out in any way. It has no edge. In HOW TO BE GOOD, Hornby's voice and characters lack their regular wickedness.Eh, if I had to do it over, I wouldn't read it."
3,From a Hornby virgin,"Brilliant writing. This book pulled me in completely. Then, in the end, it dropped me. Humorous and insightful, but ultimately disappointing due, not to style, but content.On the other hand, if you take a Sartrian view of life, you just might love this book (assuming a sense of humor is not incompatible having a Sartrian view of life)."
4,Not the best I've read.,"Overall this book starts off great but I felt towards the middle of the story the book begain to slow down and just repeat the same story over and over just in a new situation.Katie I felt was at times just whining woman who wanted things to go her way and got upset when her husband tried to change his life and she couldn't feel like she was part of it. David, well he changed a lot and there was a lot I didn't like about what he changed. There is extreme point where he got annoying. Sure it was nice to give some of the stuff they had to people who didn't have any and sure give some money to the homeless, but when he started spending all his time with Goodnews and changing the views of his children is where I got annoyed.Overall this book had sort of a poor ending with much more said about what had happen and what was going to happen."
2,disappointing,"I bought this book because I was in the mood to read a good book. The reviews made me think this was a ""hilarious romp"" and a ""powerfully sympathetic...."" yadda yadda. I must say I was extremely dissapointed. The main character is apathetic, self centered and I could not identify with her nor sympathize with her. If you are in the mood to read something that leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth, then go ahead. But I cannot say that this book was worth the money I spent on it."
2,"not very good, ... really!","'How To Be Good' by Nick Hornby is a disappointing read. Actually, the book is a mess. The plot, such as it is, involves a dysfunctional London family who brings aboard a vagrant, Mr GoodNews, who has mysterious powers to make things ... good. Yes, total rubbish. Mercifully the author does have a sense of humor. But unfortunately midway through 'How To Be Good' most of the humor fades and it becomes burdensome to read.Bottom line: it reads like the author made it up as he went along. Bad."
4,Not Hornby's best but still good,"I loved About a Boy and really, really loved the sardonic wit of High Fidelity. About a Boy is much deeper but just as cynical. Maybe even more so. The characters are richly drawn and just complex enough to keep the reader wanting more. Good read, but best to take some time with this one. Not recommended for a summer beach read."
1,A shallow gimmick.,"I'd have a hard time categorizing this as a novel. It's a cartoon gimmick idea, which Hornby has then tried to stretch into novel length. The trouble is, the gimmick is underdeveloped and not half as clever and funny as the author thinks it is. The entire book is, in short, an insult to any reader's intelligence."
3,"Good book, disappointing ending","I can't knock this book too much - I couldn't put it down and flew through it in two days. However, all that time I was looking forward to a meaningful ending that would tie everything together and encapsulate the moral of the book. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. The ending just kind of tapered off, without much denouement. I look forward to reading Hornby's better-reviewed novels, because I liked the quirky writing style and insightful character studies. I hope they have better endings."
3,"Good, but not Hornby's best","I am a fan of Nick Horby's books. I had read 'High Fidelity' and 'About a Boy' before reading 'How to Be Good'. I had heard that it wasn't great, but I wanted to judge for myself since I enjoyed his other books so much. I liked this book, but it was a lot different than his previous works. I have to give him credit for tackling the task of writing from a female point of view. I found myself at times forgetting that I was reading something a man had written. If you're a Hornby fan and haven't read this yet, you should. Just don't expect it to be along the lines of his other books.For those of you that HAVE read it - did anyone else notice the reference to Dick from High Fidelity when he is describing characters in Janet's building? I thought that was clever."
4,Both thought-provoking and laugh out loud,"I loved this book. I wont go into a synopsis of the plot, others have said it so much better, but it gave me so much to think about. The book centres on what being good means. Where does charity start - in the home or should we be looking outwards more? Or are we all just far too selfish to ever be good so all we can do is just do what we can and accept our limitations? Is being a little bit good enough or does it just end up being self-serving and hypocritical? How do we balance all the demands on us including our own?The book doesnt really answer these questions - I am not sure there is an answer and in the end the characters struggle to come to terms with their immediate problems with few resolutions but maybe more of a clear idea of where to start trying."
3,"Nick Hornby Knows How To be good, But.......","It starts out great. It gets better. Sure, it's a stretch of a plot, the kids speak like adults, cynical, jaded, world-weary adults at that. Ok, granted. However,I really liked Katie, and wanted to continue reading to know more about her and her angry man-turned do-gooder husband, and to find out how GoodNews would get his-plus chuckle at a bunch of really witty dialogue and observations. The real problem was, the ending. It didn't really end. It was like Hornby just said, OK, enough, let's end it here, closed his eyes and pointed. Or maybe i just didn't get it. I loved and ""got"" his other two books, though, so I don't think it's just me. I was rating this a 4 star, up to the last paragraph."
2,Very Disappointing!,"The only reason why I am rating this book a two, is because I am a fan of Nick Horny. However I was not a fan of this book, it lacked the humor and the originality as the other novels I read by him. About a Boy was an excellent read, as well as High Infidelity, this book just fell flat on so many areas. The main character was just weak and whiny, she complained about her horrible marriage but yet she stayed with him. I just wished that the story was told in a different character, Katie was too whiny."
4,hilarious but addresses important issues,"I thoroughly enjoyed How to be Good, and assigned it for a class I teach. The internal dialogue is hilarious but only ""too true."" Even if briefly drawn, the other than main characters serve as a foil to develop the musings and struggles of the main character."
5,"Brisk, fearless, and pointed","A great book to escape into for laughs and thoughts. Hornby beautifully weaves humor with paradox. The book made me think about things in new ways, and asked some simple questions that proved unanswerable. I would recommend ""How to be Good"" to anyone who: (1) is a bleeding heart liberal, (2) isn't a bleeding heart liberal, and/or (3) doesn't mind having their middle-class sensibilities tugged at a bit. While I was somewhat dissatisfied with the ending, it couldn't have credibly ended any other way. I look forward to seeing it as a movie."
2,Hmmmm.....,"While I loved Hornby's ABOUT A BOY. I have to say I found HOW TO BE GOOD much too tedious. GOOD is the story of a family in crisis as told in the mother, Kate's point of view. We spend waaaaay to much time in Kate's head as she agonizes over being a good doctor, and whether she should divorce her husband or not. Her husband, David is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and things take off from there.Although I liked the snappy writing style, I thought that parts of the book just drug on endlessly."
1,Get the pulping mills ready...,"... because, honestly, this is all that this book deserves. Nick Hornby is one of England's best novelists by far, but it seems that fame has its price. Every other book he has written is engaging, absorbing and masterfully written. This one must have been something he wrote decades ago and left in a drawer somewhere, or he wrote it as a dare to see if anything with his name on would sell. The question of ""how to be good,"" a very interesting premise, is totally wasted by using the most hackneyed and implausible stereotypes, the characters are paper-thin cartoons, and the result both irritates and insults the reader. What a shame - a once great author just threw it all away."
1,Disapointing...,"I loved High Fidelity and especially About A Boy, but this one was just no good. Neither characters nor plot ring true at all, and Hornby never really arrives at any conclusions. Hornby has shown that he can do much, much better, so save your time and money and pass on this one."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,This is one of the worst novels I have ever read. The contrived plot meandered in pointless circles while the stereotyped characters did nothing but annoy. Buy it only for the satisfaction of burning it and putting it out of its misery.
2,"Some fun bits, and an ending like a dull thud","Good fun with some of the characters, but please, please, can somebody explain this lame ending? Like, ""for an instant, all was wonderful! Then it sucked again."" The ending was incomprehensible, and left a foul taste. I understand Katie's retreat into books and music, but as a salve for all that is wrong with her life?It seems like most modern novelists can't write endings. It's as if they have such fun with a story, then realize they have to wrap it up, quick. Franzen's ""Corrections"" struck me the same way. Sinclair Lewis never had this trouble."
1,By one of world's best authors...,"... yet sadly one of the worst novels I have ever read. Unbelievable (in all the wrong ways), shallow and, untimately, pointless. Read anything else by him instead."
1,Nick Hornsby failure,"The very idea of the main characters is so very repulsive to the reader, it never got me to do anything except hate them thoroughly by the end of this short story about fiddling about nothing. Where 'About a boy' had interesting characters from all walks of life, this objectionable work only expresses the characters in a shallow fashion, jerking to a halt to explain unbelieveable stories about less than interesting people. The only juicy parts of the book were cut short, as confrontations came to a head only to be rigidly cut off to be explained later, as if the writer wanted to convey the story in the fashion of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", but then never coming back to the original issue. Horrid novel. Can't waste any more of my time with it, but I did warn you."
2,Snorefest.,"Boring boring boring. This book was terrible. I'm not sure why anyone would decide that these characters and plot were worth writing about, much less why anyone would want to read about them. On the whole I like Nick Hornby, I'm not sure what happened here. I paid half price for this book and I still feel gypped."
2,Too Much Reality?,"I didn't much enjoy Nick Hornby's ""How to be Good."" However, unlike some of the other reviewers, my issue with the book isn't that Hornby's characters are unrealistic--I thought his characters were believable and the situations entirely poissible. David's deelings with Goodnews are just a slightly more extreme form of a midlife crisis, but that doesn't mean that it's preposterous. I simply found the book to be very depressing, something I would not condemn a work for except that the reviews plastered on the back cover praise the work for its humor. There are funny moments, particualarly in Kate's attempts to handle her husband and daughter as they gang up on her, but overall the work is a rather upsetting look at a modern marriage. Although I didn't enjoy the book, I think the problem doesn't lie in Hornby's writing, but rather in what I felt was misrepresentation of the book's content by the publishing company."
3,Hornby just lost me,"I liked this book a lot less than his previous two, High Fidelity and About a Boy. Reading this book was like I was an involuntary tourist being dragged around the unfamiliar town, in several places that I wasn't quite convinced the best places to visit. Just a mismatch of the mindset, I guess. So long Mr. Hornby. You've just lost me."
2,it could have been so much better,"THe first 75 pages of this book are really excellent: a marriage in crisis is portrayed with humor and pain, the characterisations of the family bitingly realistic.THen, like way too many contemporary novels, it suddens adds this ridiculously lite surrealistic tone, and completely loses credibility. Badness get ""[taken] out"" of people and personalities miraculously change, etc. The novel then turns onto a strange and rather too general question of how to become a ""good"" person, which bored me, but that is a matter of taste. From a very good start, it lost for me.This is a talented writer. Perhaps my wish for more realism, which he can clearly accomplish with wit and style, is outdated. But I did not like the way the book degenerated into a kind of sit com.Alas, I am so often disappointed by the new ""happening"" novels."
3,A Disappointment,"I discovered Nick Hornby just a few months ago, and quickly absorbed all of his books. His work seemed to improve with each novel, and so I was excited to learn of the release of How To Be Good. Unfortunately, I found the novel very disappointing. While the central question -- what does it mean to be a ""good person,"" and should one really have to struggle to do it -- is interesting, the book lapses too often into caricature. That's the point, Hornby might say, since the man ""being good"" in the book has a quasi-religious conversion from petty nastiness into sickening do-gooder self-righteousness. But too many of the other characters -- a strange masseuse cum guru, a ne-er-do-well brother, a lumpish mediocre Anglican minister -- wander into the book and are not given much to do. Hornby, a ""guy writer"" with a strong masculinity in his writing, deserves credit for creating a female narrator and protagonist, and he is actually quite successful. But she deserves a better book to live in."
2,Thumbs down from a Hornby fan,"Among my favorite reads are ""About a Boy"" and ""High Fidelty."" And, truthfully, Hornby writes just as well in ""How to Be Good."" His characterizations provoke reaction, the depth of Katie's thoughts are very real, and the wry, sarcastic humor is on target.Even so, I did not enjoy this book. Finishing it was just a hair less than a struggle. I don't necessarily read to feel good all the time (though that is among the reasons), but this book _really_ doesn't make the reader feel good. It's downright depressing and frustrating. I wanted to shake Katie so many times; admonish her for not standing up for herself more.Then again, I also wanted to shake her for relying so heavily on her profession to make her ""good."" It is highly annoying. But I suspect that is part of Hornby's point, so I won't go any further down that road.A talented writer, yes. An interesting, though somewhat dubious storyline. Worth your time? Perhaps. Unfortunately only you can answer that question."
2,A disappointment,"I love High Fidelity and have read it 3 times; Fever Pitch, even though it's about soccer, is one of the best sports books written, in terms of trying to explain a personal and ultimately trivial mania to the world. I think Hornby began to lose it a little with About a Boy; I found that book to be without any edge and just a little bit too precious. But with How to Be Good, Hornby loses much credulity. Without giving away any of the plot I'll just say that the plot is not believable. Hornby does a great job with his female narrator and when he/she is explaining the rotten state of her marriage, nothing rings false. But when the ""motor"" of the book begins, the bottom falls out; after this, the book is a tough read -- why go on reading what will happen when none of what is happening seems remotely true? It's a shame; this could have been a much, much better book had not Hornby stretched us to the limits of reason. However, he is discerning, clever and unpretentious enough to rebound."
3,How to be Average,"It's difficult to call a book with so much good material ""average"", but that's what I'm doing here. Hornby has written a nebulous book which flirts with some very interesting themes while never quite acheiving any breakthroughs. Consider this a warning that ""How To Be Good"" will leave you unfulfilled.Told in the first person, through the eyes of a woman named Katie, the story is basically the whining examinations of herself and family, none of whom the reader is given to care anything about. Amazingly enough, moments in the text are downright pithy and beautiful, they just don't add up to a ""well-crafted"" story. Read it if you are a huge fan of Hornby but stick to better fare if you are just introducing yourself to him."
4,I liked it,"I've read High Fidelity and About A Boy, and they are both two of my favorite books. Therefore, I was surprised by the serious tone of How To Be Good. Yet, after I got over the initial shock, I found that I was enjoying this novel. It's not as funny as High Fidelity or About A Boy (I can't imagine a movie based on this novel), but as a study in marriage, and in what it truly means to be charitable, it's highly entertaining. Actually, I can see this book as Rob and Laura (the main characters of High Fidelity), 10 years into their marriage, if Rob were to spontaneously decide to stop being cynical take up spirituality.My one gripe with the book is that Hornby's casual, slightly detached tone is better suited towards a male rather than a female. I didn't quite believe that the person telling this story was a woman. But that's my only issue; otherwise, the book was rather good."
3,Hmm....maybe some more internal dialogue would help,"No, no it wouldn't. This book suffers from wayyyyy too much introspection on the part of the fallible protagonist, otherwise known as mom. At points, as I was slogging through certain stretches of this internal narration, I felt the utter torment that Sisyphus must have experienced as he continually rolled his stone up the hill. Not one for being totally melodramatic, I have to admit that this book, during the pages that contained actual conversation, was, at times, quite funny. Funny, as in ""Ha-Ha"", not ""Huh..."" So, all in all, it's a good read if you're stuck in Houston on a four hour lay-over becuase you got drunk the night before your flight, resulting in you missing your connection. El fin."
1,...,"This is terrible. Hopeless plot, ridiculous characters, badly written with 10s of errors of spelling and grammar (even includes 'pacific' for 'specific'!). I threw in on the floor in disgust, as did several of my friends. If you want to know just how bad it is, read any of the dialogue between son and parent and try to guess how old the son is meant to be. (Clue - he's not 36.)I like Nick Hornby but this is ...."
2,what a let down...,"sigh...after reading Nick Hornby's High Fidelity and About A Boy my expectations were that he incorporate the same brilliant wit diplayed into How to Be Good. I really gave the book a chance, hoping that with each new chapter I would become totally engrossed. It didn't happen. What did happen was a far-fetched 360 degree character twist and an unbelievable story. I stuck with it and read the WHOLE book, shaking my head and wondering why I wasted my time."
4,Katie is a real woman?,"How To Be Good is great, I enjoyed Hornby's language as usual, but the novel doesn't excite me as HF did. In my opinion Nick is sort of weak in creating a female psicology... Sometimes Katie is not as real as Rob, she kind of thinks as a man. Of course this is the only shortcoming in an otherwise great book. Nick is one of my... ""top 5"" writers ever, but this time I cannot give him a full score."
2,Pretty Boring... Annoying Characters,A friend of mine recomended this book for my book club to read. 6 of us read the book and all 6 of us complained the whole time we were reading it and hated the whole thing. The common consensus of our group was that it was impossible to make a connection and to care what happened characters because they were so annoying.
1,Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed Hornby's previous books; however, this book was a huge disappointment. As one reviewer mentioned, he has changed his tone in this novel, that wasn't the problem. The book was simply uninteresting, the main character was unappealing, the plot/dilemma is revealed within a few chapters and from there the book doesn't move, the same problem is reviewed over and over, the same character traits are displayed repeatedly with no forward plot movement. I am an avid reader and cannot remember the last time I did not finish a story regardless of how bad it was. This book did me in, I ended up skimming through the last two chapters and wishing I hadn't bothered."
3,Frustrating Novel from Nick Hornby,"Moderate enjoyment. I do like Nick Hornby quite a bit, so this isn't a total waste, but I felt very frustrated as I read this book.First of all, Hornby doesn't do a great job of writing a book from a woman's point of view. There wasn't anything that made this any different from the male narratives of his other books.Also, there is no character arc in this book, and that is what I disliked the most. Katie (the main character) never, ever changes or sees things in a new perspective. As you read the book, you wonder where things are going, because as people around her become increasingly annoying and freakish, she never changes her monotone voice.I loved ""About a Boy"" and would say if you are looking for your first or second Nick Hornby novel, read that instead.Only true fans will get anything out of this, and its not a lot."
2,Not His Best,"Somewhere in Nick Hornby's wandering meditation of just what constitutes good and bad I got lost along the way. I loved both ""High Fidelity"" and ""About A Boy"", but found alot of this book hard to even like let alone love.His narrator Katie Carr is a married doctor who's having an affair. Her husband David is a bitter syndicated columnist who undergoes a spiritual transformation which has resounding effects on Katie and her two children. The book never bored me, more just left me baffled. The characters were not particulary likable and the ending seemed too pat and neat.I came through the book not rooting for Katie or believing the novels outcome, just with a vague notion that I should be doing more for the homeless."
2,It inspired me to do something for charity...,"... by giving the book away to the nearest charity store. I received this novel as a Christmas present. It was a short read, at least, but a cringingly bad one. At least it is only a few hours from New Year now, so I can say that the extreme displeasure of wading through this pointless novel will soon be relegated to 'last year'. This book was so badly done I wouldn't know where to begin describing it. Let's just summarize by saying novels usually benefit from having a plot, and slightly credible characters (not women protagonists speaking like 40-year-old men... or little boys speaking like 40-year-old men either). I hope someone at the thrift store can find a use for it. Toilet paper, perhaps?"
1,A marginally better read than the phone book.,"An intriguing central idea, explored by a very talented author (his previous, books, anyway). Here, he does nothing with the idea except bat it around like a bored cat with a worn-out cat toy, before abandoning the novel in a limp conclusion. The characters are all bad stereotypes which only cheapen the points he occasionally tries to make in the murky swill of aimless text. It is one of the most utterly pointless books I have ever read, and a complete waste of time. His other books, however, are brilliant, so read one of those instead."
1,Wish I could give a no-star rating!,"Extremely depressing. I kept thinking it HAD to get better but, sadly, no. By the end, I was hoping something cataclysmic would happen to these extraordinarily unlikeable characters."
2,How to be good,"I have to agree with some of the posts that I see below. This was a very odd book. I purchased it thinking it was going to be one of those British-like ""Bridget Jones"" books. How far from the truth.The characters were wimpy and boring. Good News should have been kicked out of the house along with the husband and the coniving daughter.This was a waste of a read."
1,Not only depressing but chauvinistic as well...,"Extremely disappointing read about a woman in a hateful marriage to a hateful man who at times is pretty hateful herself. None of the characters are likeable, and the humor used to try to make it all palatable falls flat. Suddenly he wakes up and turns into a model of goodness while she struggles with the decision to stay or go, a decision which is made in such a way that makes me hate her even more, not because of WHAT she decides, but HOW and WHY. She is WEAK. I think Hornby actually hates her too. The underlying message of how to be good (concerning her character, not his- of course it'd be great if we could all be overflowing with good will toward men) is certainly not one I'd let any other woman OR man bother to read if given the chance."
1,Shallow Pop Drivel,"I read and enjoyed ""High Fidelity,"" but this book is junk. I feel as though Hornby is pulling one over on us, dashing this book off in the time he could scrounge between New Yorker articles and conference calls with his publisher. I would be more forgiving of the flat plot, dull characters, and failed thematics if I felt that he was giving it his all. We know from High Fidelity that he is capable of storytelling that uses pop culture references and flip Britishisms as texture but ultimately hits on something more meaningful. In ""How to Be Good,"" he asks an interesting question (the title) but does nothing with it.If you don't care about any of this and would be satisfied reading Nick Hornby's grocery list in a pretty binding, click ""Add to Cart."" If you're interested in exploring a character's ethical crisis, skip this book. Try Dostoyevsky."
4,"Not your normal Hornby book, but really good nonetheless...","If you're expecting Fever Pitch or High Fidelity, this isn't it. To start with, the main character is a woman, and Hornby tells the story from her perspective. I always think it's interesting when an author tries to tell the story from a different gender's point of view, and while this book did pander to some stereotypes, I think Hornby mostly nailed this one. The story of a woman going through a midlife crisis and a crazy family life and unfulfilling work life, questioning her existence and purpose is not an unusual story. Just like he does with his other books, he breaks down the story to show the essential humanity in all of us, regardless of gender. And it was a fun read, too."
3,"Decent read, but not comparable to other Hornby work","I was looking forward to reading a Hornby tale from the female perspective, but was somewhat disappointed in that ""How to be Good"" doesn't grab as quickly or powerfully as ""About a Boy,"" or ""High Fidelity"". While the original premise is certainly believable and easy to relate to, the book loses momentum and eventually credibility as her husband transforms himself into someone completely invented and surreal. By the end of the book, the most heartwarming and memorable passages involve the two very different, but touching, children."
3,A philosophical novel,"The reason I said this is a phil'l novel is that it asks us to examine a question Susan Wolf raised in a widely remarked article in the Journal of Philosophy (1982) called ""Moral Saints."" In that piece the author asked if she or anyone she knew should be a moral saint, and her answer was no. This novel involves someone who is a real s.o.b. being transformed by an eccentric healer named DJ GoodNews into a perfect, albeit sanctimonious, do-gooder. And the result is mixed. I don't think this is the best portrayal of the rich variety and humanness of saints; for that I'd recommend the stunningly brilliant work of Austin Farrer (1904-68), the celebrated English theologian who was C. S. Lewis's confessor."
3,A Question to Ponder,"How to Be Good, a question for all to ponder. What makes a person good ~ are you good when you are a dedicated doctor, like the main character Katie? Or are you good when you transform yourself from an angry, miserable person, to one who feeds and gives to the homeless, among other things, such as Katie's husband, David. What happens when GoodNews, a self-proclaimed healer and guru of good enters into the equation?Through the use of humor and everyday situations, Hornby has challenged the reader to evaluate the concept of good. The characters were very interesting and their process of change was compelling.'How to Be Good' was a satisfying read; it was not life changing nor will be memorable for life. There have been mixed reviews on this novel so I will try 'High Fidelity' and reserve my judgement until then."
3,Not Hornby's Best,"After having read and thoroughly enjoyed Hornby's two previous works, ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"", I had expectations that ""How to be Good"" would be of a similar standard. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case.""About a Boy"" is simply too far fetched to be funny. It is hard to imagine someone going through a road to Damascus conversion and changing from an embittered person to a person who only does ""good"". While the style is perhaps classic Hornby, the subject matter just simply doesn't work.My advice to readers new to Hornby is to read his other works before this one. If this one is chosen as your introduction to the author, my fear is that your introduction will have no follow up. And that would be a shame as Hornby has much to offer."
3,Not so good...,"I love Nick Hornby and I've read all his novels. There is something about this last one that I just couldn't connect with. Dr. Katie Carr is not all that sympathetic. There were times I wanted to shake her and send to see Dr. Phil. Of course, she lives in England. Nevertheless, I applaud Hornby for the risks he took in this book...and there are some interesting ruminations. In the end, I found myself not connected to Katie (Or David or Goodnews or Molly or Brian...etc) they way I was connected to Will and Rob of his other novels. My favorite part was seeing Dick from High Fidelity make a cameo here. Not a homerun, but I will be reading whatever he has cooking up next."
2,Not quite entertaining,"I've been dragging myself to finish this book in the past 3 weeks and finally I'm close to the end but not feeling exciting at all. There are funny and hilarious moments, with outstanding observation and descriptions of characters and scenes but overall not quite witty and the flow is not smooth. Difficult to grasp the main points that it intends to deliver. Better watch Hugh Grant in "" About a boy"" instead."
2,Not worth the little time it takes to read,"I was drawn to this as a fan of Hornby's ""High Fidelity"" and ""A Long Way Down"", but was sorely disappointed. The charming social wit that made his works popular was almost entirely absent in this one and, though I made it to the end, all that came of it was the ability to warn others away. My apologies to an otherwise enjoyable author, but... after reading this, you will probably want those few hours of your life back."
2,Some good parts but weak overall,"I really enjoyed High Fidelity and About A Boy so I thought this would be just as good. Not so. Only read it if you are a completist, anybody else should pass."
1,It's like pulling teeth.,"I am going to have to stop listening to recommendations from friends.I purchased this book ONLY because my good friend raved about it.Well I am also raving about it. Raving mad.What a load of ...... I tried to get into this story, and just could not get over the hump that someone would want to live with someone like that.That goes for both characters.I kept plowing away at it, cause MY FRIEND SAID SHE LOVED IT...............and you know what, the premise is so non believable, that I finally got to the 8th chapter and gave up.I was surprised that I gave it that much.First time I've read anything by this author, and I do not think I will read him again.There are just too many good books out there."
3,I enjoyed it...I think,"Well, I loved ""About a Boy"" and I enjoyed the film of ""High Fidelity"" (I've yet to read it) so I was excited to find this novel by Nick Hornby. As always, he is surprising and dark, bitter at times, cutting, funny...it's a novel that is difficult to pigeon-hole. I really enjoyed it, I think. It's one of those books that one keeps rolling over their tongue and around their brain for days afterwards. It definitely made an impact and had some very interesting insights into society. Perhaps I get upset too easily but I often wanted to shout some sense into the lead character (whose observations are teribbly funny, but often fatally short-sighted) but I believe that's the point. I have to let this one percolate in my brain for a bit. Parts were wonderful, but as a whole I wasn't crazy about this novel."
3,How to be Almost Good,"What a promising beginning, a delightful middle, and a disappointing ending! Loved the first 90% of the book, but then it took a nose-dive. Nearing the end, I remember thinking ""How is Hornby going to pull off a great ending with only 20 pages to go?"" Well, the answer is that he couldn't. Truly had a good time reading it, but it just fell flat at the end."
1,Unfortunate overstretch by an otherwise competent author.,"What a shame. Nick Hornby does so well when writing about subjects he knows about. Here, however, he tries to break the formula and write about something different - and it all goes horribly, horribly wrong. The story... well, just isn't a story, simply one idea stretched beyond breaking point. The characters are cartoon-like, and in the end it just doesn't work. Read anything else by this brilliant author, but avoid this stinker."
2,Not that Great,"Didn't like this one much, for many of the same reasons that others have said below. In the first few chapters I really didn't feel Katie thought and acted as a woman, which really irritated me, but this did get better. It was well written, as in readable, and thought provoking in places, but far too much went unexplained, and there was no satisfactory resolution. Too much just seemed to be allowed to happen without context or justification. I was glad to finish it!"
2,should have been better,i'll keep this review short and to the point (unlike the book itself)... 'how to be good' drags on and on with characters you could not care less about.
1,Nick Nornby is a great writer but not with this one,"Buy High Fidelity or about a boy, but stay away fom this junk. Unfortunately, the only way you'll confirm that I'm right is to read it. And that's too bad."
2,I'm so relieved to see the other bad reviews!,"Usually a Nick Hornby fan, but not this time. Besides being meandering, plotless, bizarre and implausible the characters are all quite dislikable, most notably the narrator. While the other characters seem to have a character arc, no matter how unrealistic it may be, the narrator remains hateful, unhappy and stuck, with little kindness for anyone nor any self reflection. That she has an epiphany about the pleasure of reading is just further torture to this reader since this book seems to bring little joy to anyone."
3,"Being good, blah blah blah...","This was a half-hearted effort. Hornby wrote it as if he had no experience whatsoever at being married, separated, a parent, etc. He gets it half-right and writes it mostly well, but it is still off the mark somehow. It is an entertaining read, but it doesn't seem TRUE at all. Nobody with kids is that far-fetched. Still, it was a fun read and probably people with no kids would buy the goofy characters. (Real parents know it's not like that.)"
1,Lousy!!!,"A great writer totally loses the plot on this novel. Probably one of the worst novels ever written. Pointless, meandering, annoying and amateur. Read the brilliant novels he wrote before this one to see just how far Hornby fell here."
4,How to be good,Interesting view of marriage. Different way of understanding the wat people interact. Funny & a bit sad. Kept my interst.
4,Hornby Asks The Big Question,"Hornby moves ever closer to ""literature"" with his third novel. It's not as funny as his earlier two, but it's easy and enjoyable to read. Hornby sets up a situation in which he can look straight at the issue of ""being good"" in a culture that doesn't seem to value more than an imitation of it. While the situation he creates, the transformation of an ""Angry Man"" into a ""good person"", is unlikely, the mayhem that ensues seems totally believable. Unfortunately, in an age where martyrdom is (hopefully) passe, Hornby leaves us with no guidance, beyond the sage advice to keep on learning, and keep on asking the big questions. It's a good book that takes on some deep issues in an enjoyably readable fashion. I hope Hornby has many more books in him!"
3,It's Alright.,"This book had me cracking up through the first several chapters, but overall, it seems very drawn out... Nothing that 'kept me on the edge of my seat' the whole time. I will say, Nick Hornby is brilliant. -This was just not my favorite book. Might be yours though! It was worth the read."
4,"How to Be Good is Good, Really Good!","This is a story about a family trying to come to terms with a spiritual change that takes place in the husband/father. The protagonist, the unhappy wife, finds that her husband has gone thru a metamorphosis from a cynical, sophisticated but hateful creature to an, in my opinion, equally hateful, milque-toast pseudo-saint... The story had me analysing what IS good in the true sense of the word. Is being good so important? The book is funny and sad and sophisticated, wise and paradoxical. It is a great read."
3,An entertaining read with many levels,"This book will keep you in stitches for a few hours (it's on the short-side) -- your airplane rowmates will wonder what you are sniggering at. The book can go much deeper than a couple laughs if you allow yourself to muse over the difficulties of actually ""being good."" I found the narrator, Katie Carr, to be a completely unsympathetic character - at one point she tells her daughter that her parents will not get divorced if she is good. However, because I did not like or relate to Katie or her husband, David, I was not on ""Katie's side"" or ""David's side"" throughout their quarrels. I think I put a lot more thought into the read as an unbiased observer. My boyfriend is reading the book now, and he is enjoying it as much as I did. A bunch of my friends would really enjoy this book, and I would recommend this book as a present for anyone except the devoutly religious."
4,Historical Insights,"I LOVE this book! It is an odd little tomb but one that we would ALL do well to read. Though the book is a little bit hard to read, as it leans towards the scholarly tomb format, it is still well worth it if you are looking to have an open and educated knowledge base.This little gem explores the historical roots of sexism and shows the paths many women throughout history have had to resort to in order to be heard and validated, especially in the male dominated world of Math and Science.Read it, knowledge is ALL-WAYS a good thing and any knowledge that deviates from the accepted sociatal norms is worth exploring. Remember the old addage 'history is written by the winner' here too we see the injustices of history."
1,A pretty crummy book ....,"I rated this book at one star only because amazon.com doesn't allow a reviewer the option of zero stars. The author of this book is a biochemist -- not a trained historian -- and her amateurism certainly shows, particulary in the early chapters where a competent historian would be careful in the assessment of the historicity of sources. So Alic retails a tradition -- presented as though it has a factual basis -- about Moses and his wife operating a medical school in Egypt. Never mind that there is virtually no evidence independent of the Bible that Moses even existed. Perhaps needless to say that the Bible contains no mention of said medical school. Shortly thereafter readers are told that Cleopatra studied human anatomy and physiology by dissecting condemned prisoners alive. The source for this horror story turns out to be a rabbinical tradition -- scarcely an unbiased source when dealing with Greeks or Greek culture. The rest of the book is at best naive hagiography."
5,Amazing!,"I was hooked right from the first page. Claire Delacroix has an amazing writing style. This is my first book of hers and I can't wait to start the next in the trilogy. The chemistry between the H/h was perfect and the dialogue was quick and witty. Talk about a strong heroine! Merlyn was dark, mysterious and wonderful. I absolutely loved the way this book flowed. Wonderful!"
1,YukkY!,This product is overloaded with lavender. Why not just buy a bottle of lavender and put it on my face? lol
1,New Formula is no good,"The moisturizer pictured here is the old formula, but what I got was thew new ""Lavender Luminosity"" daily mositurizer forumla and it is no good. It's drying and not moisturizing at all. Too bad because I've loved this stuff and used it for years."
1,This is a new formula,"The high rated reviews refer to the old moisturizer, which I also used. It was great, and deserved a five star review. The ""New, More Sustained"" cream is nothing like the old formula. It does not moisturize at all, instead, it dries on the skin very quickly, feels like a mask and very heavy. I wish they would not have messed with the formula, and left it alone. Now I will never buy it again, until they make a decision to return to previous formula. The picture of the product is still the old one, but the jar that arrives is the new, more sustained product, and it is not good at all. I do not recommend it."
4,Pretty Good,"While I do like this product, it hasn't seemed to lessen my acne at all. Also, the granules in the scrub are not fine (as in small) at all so if you have very sensitive skin this might not be for you. I like how my skin does feel more soft after using it and it does not dry it out at all."
5,The Perfect Face Scrub,"This is the best face scrub I've bought in a long time, and I normally get Origins or Clinique ($$$). After a decision to try more organic face care, I picked this up and have never been sorry. It brightens your face and slogs off dead skin cells without disrupting sensitive skin's balance AND without chemicals or animal testing. Definitely a worthwhile buy!! My roommate liked it so much she finally just bought her own..."
2,not for all skin types,"Dissapointed, misled by all the good reviews! def. Not for all skin types. The exfoliate is coarse, not suitable for sensitive or if your skin is dry/combination. I felt it was scratching my face. The enzyme was probably what stripped the little oil I have (+winter time right now). After washing my face was flaky white from my dead? Or dry? Skin, around the cheeks and t-zone. The texture is probably like the normal st.ives apricot scrub...but this one w.the 'enzyme' makes it worse in my opinion."
3,New and Improved?,"Okay, fans of single file are probably going to be a little dissapointed with Rise and Run. its a) ALOT more mathy, b) mixed much differently with alot less gain on the guitars, c) not quite as catchy.however, i could have seen this coming and i do beleive that this is a logical next step in their evolution. its a little harder to listen to than their other stuff, and frankly, doesnt really compare to Single File.i still gave it 3 stars because the songs that are good, and the parts that are catchy, are really really good and really really catchy. if only they had this guitar sound on the other records.id give it a listen first, but its still not a bad buy. however, if youre just getting into them, id start with Single File."
4,Full of hard facts,"An interesting book that is written by a weapons expert who was the only expert called in to test Oswalds gun that was able to recreate Oswald's feat of firing the bullets fast enough. He actually comes to the conclusion that is was a secret service office who accidently fired the shot when he stumbled with his rifle. Pretty implausible I think but interesting if you extend the trajectory of the bullet back past the secret service officer and it lines up with the winodw of w building across the street from the book depository. The Author tends to put on blinkers once he decides that the secret service guy fired the shot and discount anything else, but his facts on the bullet trajectories seem pretty solid."
5,"To the reader from Alton, IL","For the same reason that so many other people that were close to the investigation, ended up passing away from ""natural cause's"" as in the goverenment cover up of the events . . ."
2,Good presentation of a flawed theory,"This thesis by American Howard Donahue has been in the public domain since 1992 but has received little support. In brief, he claims that Secret Service agent Hickey, riding in the car behind JFK in the motorcade, stumbled upon hearing shots and had a Negligent Discharge of the AR15 rifle he was holding, and that this shot accidentally hit JFK in the back of the head. This claim is not substantiated by the book, which is heavily padded with extraneous commentary. The author weakens his credibility by assuming Oswald's guilt, accepting the 'single bullet theory' and by claiming to have discovered the AR15 when the presence of this weapon has been known since the Warren Report. Overall, an entertaining theory but not a serious contribution to the assassination debate."
2,"Just a theory, but an interesting one","What if one of the Secret Service agents in JFK's backup car stumbled and inadvertently shot the President? An unlikely thesis, but one which is quite convincingly tabled here as author Menninger relates the long and painstaking research of an American ballistics expert. Fine as a magazine article, but the concept is thin and the book is mostly padding. Menninger too readily accepts Lee Harver Oswald's involvement in the assassination and his account of the angles of fire is flawed. An interesting contribution to the assassination archives and well illustrated, but not to be taken too seriously."
3,"Plausible, but not probable","This is a really well written book with a very unique slant on the assassination of JFK. The authors theory is interesting and he has some proof, but it was not convincing, at least not to me. He does an excellent job defending the single-bullet theory. THere are minor factual errors, but it is worth a read. For the best book on the subject however, read Posner's Case Closed"
4,"Too Much Money for ""New"" and is Better Suited with Kids","This game is one of those expensive-and-for-kids-only games that you find lurking near by here. I find Harry Potter Quidditch World Cup okay just not amazingly fun. I'd play it from time to time but playing it often... not a chance! I'm suggesting noncritical Harry Potter fans to play this rather than deep-down lovers of Quidditch that'll overcriticize the whole scenario. FYI: throughout the Harry Potter movie series, there's only 5 Quidditch-like movies and the rest are just romance or action-packed. Heads up, if you've bought all of the Harry Potter books then Quidditch is a whole different story."
3,Made a wonderful gift.,"My nephew was looking for this in a PC release, and I found a new/sealed one here on Amazon:) He says its very fun and he is a tad older than the target age. His only complaints are the menu system."
3,Easy!!!,"When I started to play this game it seemed like a lot of fun. But after the same repetetive gameplay over and over, It started to get very boring. The game idea is good, but there is no altitude control,and it is just way too easy. It isn't worth playing the World Cup over again with the different team because it will just be the exact same thing.I have never considered myself very good at sports games, but at this game, i can easily cream the other team 500 to 0."
2,Eh...,"When I viewed a preview of this game I was thoroughly surprised with the graphics et cetera. When I received the game as a gift, I was most excited. About twenty minutes into the game I was bored stiff. The game is either too simple at times (I won every single one of my matches just by doing the same moves over and over again) or too confusing (there was way too many tricks to learn and comprehend whilst playing multiple positions.) I loved the whole idea of the game as well as the graphics, I just found the game too easy at times and got bored of it quite fast."
2,For the wee ones,"I agree with most of the other reviewers here: This game was clearly designed for younger kids, with the fun, eye-candy set high and any possible frustration kept to a minimum. It's clear that EA Games just adapted a soccer-game engine, trying to minimize the three-dimensional nature of Quidditch. That, combined with the utterly predictable AI system, makes it possible for an adult player to WIPE THE FLOOR with any and all comers.It's aggravating, really: It's not likely that there will be another version of this game made for adults with, say, an AI system worthy of the name. And EA games could have so easily created a workable 3D flying system--just use the usual WASD/three-button mouse controls from any first-person shooting game or else the independent-gravity flight engine from ""Freelancer"" or similar."
2,Harry Potter Quiditch Easy World Cup,This game is kinda fun; in multiplayer. But the inadjustable AI level makes it to EASY. In perspective just unlock everything and then just play multiplayer.BOTTOM LINEOnly buy this if you have relatives willing to play.
5,It's All About the Quidditch,"This game could have a lot of potential, I know very little about it but I do know that it will be a sports game all about quidditch, you can play at Hogwarts on one of the house teams but you can also play in the Quidditch world cup. Also, you can play any position on the team. In earlier Harry Potter games, the quiditch was not very fun, you could only be seeker and you would just fly through hoops until you got the oppurtunity to catch the snitch. I hope that EA will not turn this idea that has huge potential into a big hunk of poo."
4,Solid Experience - Buying the DVD upon release,"OK, some folks reviewing here didn't like the basic Bible story. That's their own issue to deal with. I grew up with it and am raising my kids that way so it didn't bring it down for me.We (my wife, two young girls, and me) saw it right after it opened in our area. This was the first time I've had my girls (then 3 & 5) in a theater, so I wasn't sure they would sit through the whole thing. They did great and loved the movie. When I told my oldest it was on DVD next Tuesday, she wanted to be sure we were going to buy it and watch it that night.I was very pleased with the quality and animation. I've got multiple VeggieTales and 3-2-1 Penquins videos/DVD's and find them to be of very high quality. I wasn't sure Phil & Mike could pull off the ""big screen"" bit, but they did very well, made money, and now know where they can improve.8 big thumbs up from this family. Keep them coming on the big and small screen alike."
4,Good Stuff!,"I am baffled by the reviewer below who is baffled that this movie of Jonah does not tell the story of Job. (Also her complaints that the Veggies in VeggieTales have no limbs. I'd say they make the best of what they have!)This is not a perfect movie -- the 1/2 hour short is still, probably, the ideal length for the messages and humor of the VT creators. But there is some solid animation, some good (if not classic) songs, and the message is value-laden without being heavy-handed. Indeed, the movie ends with Jonah still ""not getting it,"" the idea that he must accept others as being worthy of God's word. A message that all sides in the current travails might ponder."
4,Jonah movie,"A bit too grown-up and long for my 2 and a half year old, but it's pretty good. Veggie Tales is a known product, so you know what to expect."
1,DVD was very bad quality.,"I ordered this DVD as a gift for my nephew and it came promptly but didn't work at all past the menu screen on their DVD player. It worked on our player, but has lines on the screen throughout the movie. Very disappointing for a brand new DVD. We kept it because I didn't want to deal with sending it back, and I just bought him another Veggie Tales DVD locally. Really a bummer since it was a gift."
2,At times...very difficult to watch,"Ok, I'm not Christian, and that's the big problem. If you aren't a Christian, or at least God believing, you are not going to like this movie, and I didn't. The whole movie felt like a long sermon, where I was at times being bombarded with the Bible.If that kind of a movie would be appealing to you, then you should go watch this Veggie movie. If, like me, you find this painful to endure, then I'd stay away."
2,disappointed and surprised,This movie may be okay for some very young children. My eleven year old was miserable most of the time and my five year old was moderately entertained. The music and the songs were ordinary and simple; nothing to hum home afterward. My husband and I were disturbed and bored and we found it overly religious and preachy. The dialog and song lyrics of the talking vegetables really gave me the creeps. The intended lessons were too forced and overstated. This is something that would be appropriately aired on one of the religious television channels...
1,Propaganda For Kids?,"Cartoons with agenda. It is more like relegious advertisament. Doesnt serve the religion well, and using corporate propaganda style to sell ideas to kid not only is immorla but also can have a backlash."
1,Not the type of movie I want my child to watch,"Slick animation & catchy tunes (thus the 1 star) but historically inaccurate Christian propaganda. In theory the message of mercy & compassion seem like positive messages but unfortunately the message is twisted. Are they teaching children to have mercy for hmmmm... say privileged drug addict politicians, but not for incarcerated people of color on death row? Was not Jesus on death row?Also, for a show that would sound to parents like it would promote vegetables & healthy eating, they sure do glamourize cheese puffs!Furthermore, for a movie that is historically inaccurate; cheese puffs, a pirate ship, with motor etc., they decide to include text about ""your wives & sheep"". So it is sexist to boot!This is not the type of movie I want my child to watch."
2,It is not that i dont like it is a cd music no the Movie,I order the movie but i got a cd music. It is nice but it wasnt what i order. It says Jonah: A Veggietales MOVIE!
4,Jonah; Veggie tales,This movie is about the prophet Jonah who ran away from his assignment from God. Lots of lessons for parents and children. To have mercy & compassion for others. I recommend it for kids of all ages. I purchased this for my grandchildren.
1,Dvd was really scratched.,"The dvd was really scratched, making the beginning choppy. It still seems to play, but we did not pay for a scratched dvd and that is what we received."
5,A lesson to remember,My three children and I loved the movie.It was very inspirational.The children are still humming the tones.I hope the movie is welll recieved so that they can make other Biblically based movies.Good job Big Idea.
5,Great Family Entertainment!,My three year old and I both loved this film. I will echo the comments of others that this is a great film for old and young alike and has plenty to keep both entertained. My wife was so jealous that she had to stay home with the baby that she is going this weekend and taking the three year old back! It is wonderful to have some good G-Rated entertainment out there for the family to enjoy together.
3,The movie was OK -- not as good as we hoped.,"This review is in regards to the movie. We saw it with our son. The movie was ok but just not quite as good as some of the other Veggie Tale movies. ""The Star of Christmas"" that just came out on DVD last month is considerably better. The ultimate critic was our small son who is normally mesmerized by the Veggie Tales. He grew restless watching this movie. Bob the Tomato has just a minor roll in the movie while Larry the Cucumber has a slightly larger part but is still not the main character. I think that is why my son grew bored. I give it the movie an average rating at best. My personal recommendation is ""The Star of Christmas""."
3,"Not a bad movie, but I hate their ending","As much as I love veggietales, I do not like the ending of this film. It is the biblical story of the prophet Jonah. If you check your Bibles, the story of Jonah ends with God explaining to Jonah why the city of Ninevah was not destroyed (Our God is a God of second chances: when the people of Nineveh repented, God forgave them). Veggietales added a whole musical number about Jonah not understanding. The Bible does *not* say anything about Jonah ""never getting the point"" of the story after God explained it to him.I believe that Jonah understood after God explained it to him. After all, he was accustomed to talking to God as you or I would talk to a friend, so why not wait for an explanation. I have a child named Jonah, which makes it worse. I want my son to believe that he is capable of learning to forgive, and I don't appreciate him or his sister singing ""Jonah never got the point"".I much prefer Lyle the kindly viking ...!"
3,Pretty good not bad.,"Its an okay movie........I guess its okay. When I saw the commercails I really wanted to see it but never got the chance. heres the basic idea. They hit a seafood restraunt, the pirates talk about jonah, they sing, its over. I saw it at a friends huse who said it was his or one of his favorite movies. I like the fat that it christain based. but i think it was aimed for younger audinces, but i liked it all the same. i think its a good stroy but they should have done noah or something people are more familer with. not that i dont know jonah. its okay. i"
2,Boring,"The animation was not bad, the sound track OK, but it was outright boring from the start, and save for a few brief moments here and there, it never took off.A Christian friend of mine recommened Veggie Tales videos a few years back. They were, well, boring. When a feature film came to DVD, and we were looking for something for our son to watch, I picked this one up. What a mistake!..."
1,My kids were bored.,The movie that my kids saw before this was Ice Age. That one they enjoyed immensely. Jonah kept them interested for less than an hour of its running time.
2,Too hard,I am trying to do some simple projects for church and the book is so much and over my head. I am now trying to learn it with the Help but it is slow going.
5,wonderful autobiographical reading,"This lovely book concerns the life of one of the most distinguished Egyptologist: I. E. S. Edwards (1906-1996). His most unusual 'affair' with Egyptology started, as a young man, when he learned of Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb. His life was made of passion and his energy seemed to touch everyone around him. His life was one that could surely touch many of those interested in studying Egyptology and a lesson in sharing, internationally, the discoveries and in propagating a vision of the past."
3,"A Mighty Good Listen...but includes ""Long Train SKIPPING""","I have a buddy who plays on the road with MSM, so I purchased this as a starting point. The CD is well produced the band sounds tight and up front. My beef is with the re-recording. Who ever used the original master grabbed a copy that had a SCRAAAAAAAATCH right in the middle of MSMs cover of the Doobie's ""LONG TRAIN RUNNING"". You know the kind you used to have on a turn table? This is a shame, as a novice to his music, that song was one I could relate to, and wanted to show case to sell others on Sam's mighty voice..I don't enjoy folks that write how the CD did not play and all that when they received their disc but in this case I have to warn you MSM's engineer missed the boat here..It is a 4 star performance, intimate and exciting. I wish they had put as much time into mastering the tape as they did in performing."
3,It is ok.,"I bought three bottles and used up two bottles so far. I don't see much of difference. I am not particularlly fond of the texture of it as it is sticky. I am giving it a three star as it did no harm either. I will finish up the third bottle, but I don't think that I will buy another one."
5,Great Friends Collection to posses,"This is my first of the Friends DVD which I ordered from Amazon and I'm really pleased to own this. Even though it has only the best 5 episodes, it is really a worth for any Friends Fan. I also ordered Best of Friends Seson 3 and Best of Friends Season 4."
4,Country gospel great,"This is a very interesting mix of gospel songs from Dan Roberts. Some of the songs are just simply great like swing low sweet chariot, Jesus loves Me and the unforgetable battle hymn of the republic. Nothing but the blood is great too, this album is a great family album who like the gospel on the more traditional country style. With nice soft vocal harmonies from Dan and brothers. There a few patchy parts in production but all in all a great piece of country gospel."
1,27 mg,"The pills in this item are 27 milligrams of ferrous gluconate each.Now you know, because it certainly doesn't say this anywhere in the product description."
5,Great product,I just started using Fergon because of low iron and noticed an immediate change in my energy level. Definitely would recommend this supplement to others.
5,Good for sensitive stomachs,I have a sensitive stomach and this is the only iron that doesn't make me nauseous. I take one pill a day to help with my low iron levels. I take it with Vitamin C to increase absorption. My iron levels are slowly increasing. It's hard to find in stores so I'm glad amazon carries it.
5,Need iron? This is the one to use.,"Better than Ferrous Sulfate which can casue ""stomach"" problems. However: Need 2 of these to equal 1 of Ferrous Sulfate free iron content."
3,Three bits of story make this feel a bit of an odd package.,"#58: An odd man out story that sees Prof. X in a hostage situation where he must contend with a two-headed mutant named Syndicate. Interesting but not really compelling. And the art is minimalist, lackluster.#59-60: Storm goes after Wolverine up in the great white north. Wolverine is out to find more info on his mysterious past. Seems Storm and Wolvie have a bit of a thing going (and that doesn't really gel, doesn't feel right). Deathstrike is introduced and she isn't after whom you'd think she'd be after. Better art than #58 though penciler Stuart Immonen draws Wolverine looking like a 50-year-old man (maybe that's part of the reason why he and Storm don't really feel like they seem right together). More backstory for Storm than Wolverine.Annual #1: Rogue makes off with Gambit. A lovesick Juggernaut catches up with them. There's a big fight. Someone dies and someone is reborn, kinda. This was a slugfest and was fun."
2,meh,"Pretty mediocre stories. I am used to the ultimate universe changing a couple of established facts but this one with deathstrike being storms enemy seemed way off to me. Annual issue its worth while, we get a nice fight between gambit and juggy."
3,1/3 good for me,"if you like Storm and Lady Deathstrike and Wolverine, in that order, good.If you like Prof.X's powers, are interested in everyday uses for telepathy and bank thiefs, good.If you like Rogue and Gambit's coupling, their adventures and Juggernaut, his powers and his magic crystal thing, good for you.These are the three stories, and they are okay. The Storm one was especially catching, but overall you look back and say hey that wasnt very productive. So be prepared for those storiees"
3,More work than it's worth - sometimes,"For anything other than straight lines, it's great and very helpful. If you just need straight line pieces, get a ruler and an exacto knife. it's faster and easier to clean."
1,falls apart!,"This review page made me give it a star, but it should have none!This rolling cutter is not useful at all! I roll it and it comes undone at the screw and falls apart. I now have the newer version from Wilton called the Fondant Ribbon Cutter (the new purple packaging) [...] and while it's more expensive, it's much better, the cutter roll snaps tightly in place and rolls fine, cutting good straight lines."
1,another disappointing Wilton product,"As other reviews have stated, this does not cut straight, pulls the fondants, unscrews, etc. Much easier to use a ruler and pastry cutter."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have purchased a lot of Wilton products in the past, and I must say that this is the most dissapointed that I have ever been with one of their products. My daughter used it and feels the same way about it...you are better off with a pizza cutter and a ruler! It was just not designed very well. When you roll it, the nut unscrews that holds the hole thing together and it doesn't cut a very clean line either. It's too bad because it looks like it should work and I believe with a little tweaking from Wilton, they could come up with one that does. But for now I would suggest that others not waste their money like I did...big dissapointment!"
5,Best cresent wrench,"Between quality and perfect sizing, this is the most ideal adjustable wrench i own. I purchased a 24"" of the same type, but it wasn't much bigger...just a longer handle and a slightly larger jaw opening."
2,One picture per set of batteries,"We have owned this camera for almost two years now. While it was a great little camera for the first 15 months, it now runs through batteries faster than I can take a picture - literally. Customer service recommends using rechargeable batteries (which I have been using), but otherwise repair was their only solution. Friends with the same camera are also having the same problem. While other manufacturers might charge a little bit more, I think a different brand (i.e. Nikon) is well worth the investment."
1,"Has inherent ""Battery Depleted"" problem. Effectively useless.","My friend let me borrow her Pentax S40. I used it for about 10 minutes on a fresh set of alkaline AA batteries. Then upon starting it up I got a ""Battery Depleted"" message on the LCD and then it shut off after about 1-2 seconds. I tried switching to other brand new batteries with the same results. I got on the net and researched ""Pentax S40 Battery Depleted"" and found many other people encountered the same problem, only no one found a solution and apparently there is no support from the company. One person said that it is a mechanical problem. Furthermore, there is no option for ""factory reset"" in the owner's manual.I have to conclude that this product is defective and the company needs to do a recall on it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Very poor image quality,"I bought this camera last week and was so disappointed by the poor picture quality. It NEVER produces a good and clear picture. I have owned a Canon 4MP camera, the picture quality is so much better than this Pentax camera. Also, the LCD screen is of low-resolution and very noisy in low-light level. Go buy a Canon camera!"
3,"Nice camera,but battery does not Last!",This is a nice camera and it takes great pictures! I have had it for over a year. I don't know what these other people are talking about. The pictures are beautiful! i just wish the batteries would last longer.This was my first digital camera.I think I am going to get a 10 MP so i can get a better zoom. I also would have liked a bigger LCD screen.UPDATE:I just found out that you have to buy special batteries for this camera-not AA batteries but CRV batteries. NOW THIS CAMERA WORKS PERFECTO!
3,Pentax Optio S40,"This camera was purchased because of its low price, low weight and small size. It was going to be installed in a radio controled airplane. While this camera has many interesting bells and whistles, its ability to control contrast and to capture colors is poor, compared to Nikon and Canon of similar megapixel ratings. I could see little difference in contrast when the in-camera contrast was adjusted, and reducing the ASA/sensitivity did not help. The shadows and blacks always had a strong blue cast, even when cloudy/sunny settings were manipulated. The quality of the images were even beyond the help of Photoshop CS. I recommend it only for beginners."
2,Nice size but very slow and broke easily,"I bought this last year and liked the look and the size, as well as the aa batteries, but discovered to work well you had to buy special aa batteries, and even with these the camera was very slow. Not just slow btwn pics, but slow in capturing images after you press the trigger. So, it took nice pictures if my subject was a mountain or something that stood still, but many pics turned out blurry from the fact that the flash went off a number of times and people moved before the camera captured the photo. Additionally, I dropped the camera from a few feet and the lens stuck open, so i felt it wasn't very durable."
1,DO NOT BUY PENTAX PRODUCTS,"I recently bought a Pentax camera. At the start of my vacation the LCD screen burst while I was riding in the car. I was very frustrated because I could not change camera settings for the rest of my trip. The real kicker came when I sent it back under warranty. I was told, ""It is not possible for there to be a defect in manufacturing. If there is no defect in manufacturing, we don't pay for repairs."" In other words, there products have problems and there warranty is useless because they don't actually uphold it ever since nothing could be there fault according to their representatives."
1,**WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP CAM**,A friend of mine gave me this cam as a gift and as soon as i took one picture.I got the infamous battery depleted error popping up.I recommend anyone considering to buy this cam google pentax optio s40 battery depleted.So far there is no fix.They should do a recall and the sellers up here should quit trying sell it to pple that are not aware of the malfunction it has.O well in the garbage it gos.
4,It was so good movie like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.,"Roy Rogers and Dale Evans is good song of Nevada, this is black and white film. That's so beautiful place.Jerry"
3,"Lots of good info, but a little hard to keep straight.","I found a lot of the information about miedieval combat sport in this book most enlightening. It is a good read if you are into medievalrecreation or history.I had one major problem in following Mr. Crouch, though. He often blurred the distinction between medieval historical sourses and medieval fictional sources. I found many paragraphs where he would quote an exant period decree text and _Morte' de Arthur_ back-to-back without taking a breath. If you arern't already familiar with the nature of the texts, you might become confused as to what part of his description is historical fact and what part has been colored through the eyes of storytelling.Probably not a good first text on the medieval history, but if you're already up on medieval studies, anad want some specific info on this particular aspect, it's a good addition to your collection."
4,Good buy.,"I was impressed with this machine. I read the reviews here and cross-referenced with Consumer reports. The CR bit was more about electric vs Gas. Essentially the plus for electric: easier cleanup of machine when finished, saves on long term maintenance (no tune-ups or gas) and ease of portability. The downside is that if it will take longer to do the same job with a gas one and the PSI is not as high.With that in mind...it still did the job. It will clean algae off bricks, oil spots, dirt and etc. This little guy is a good investment IMHO. I was pleased with its performance and the price is spot on. I would recommend it. Now if I decide to clean the entire driveway that will be a long project.So, for big projects allot for a fair amount of time, but for short term maintenance ones, this will do the trick."
1,Extremely fragile,"The construction of the parts is of very poor quality. My nozzle broke in shipping. I ordered a replacement, but that was 8 weeks ago. Ask them on status and I get ""Its on back order""."
4,Bang for the buck,"The instructions are a little iffy, but once you get this thing all connected, it does a hell of a job. We've used it to clean siding, bricks, sidewalks, driveways, etc.It seems well built and very sturdy. No reason to spend hundreds of dollars on a pressure washer. For around the house, yard or garden, this thing is perfect."
4,Works great with good water pressure,"This is a quality item and works very well IF you have good water pressure. In our house, the water pressure is low and in order to compensate, we bought a very thin hose. Otherwise, pressure is sporadic. This is not to fault the item because it performs as it should. Just a caution."
3,Works great if the cheap plastic parts doesn't break on you!,"I was happy that the product was light enough for me to carry onto the roof for cleaning off the tiles. However, the cheaply made plastic part that connects the unit to the water hose broke after a few hours of usage. I have been trying to find a copper replacement part at hardware stores like Lowes and Home Depot but have not been able to.This product would have gotten a 1 star from me since it only worked for a few hours, and broke when I was barely pulling the gun as I was cleaning and didn't notice that the length was not far enough. But it is light and was exactly what I was looking for so it gets 3 stars. There is no way that you can prevent the plastic part that connects the hose from breaking, so be forewarned."
1,Good value until it breaks......and it will,"The unit worked fine for about three hours then the nozzle would no longer adjust to full power stream. Could not replace just the tip - had to buy the entire wand so I ended up spending a few hours to build tools necessary to free up the nozzle adjust mechanism. Second season the ""plastic"" hose coupler broke. This is a poorly designed part and you have to be extremely careful not to stress it - good luck. This part is $10 + shipping from McCulloch except they no longer make it and nobody has it in stock. I went to [...] and ask where I might find a similar part. It turns out that this is a fee service and for $37 a technician would tell me how to solve my problem.Forget McCulloch, there are better options when you need power tools"
2,Tedium par excellence!,"The study of history has it's fascination for the modern reader to understand what happened in these far flung places of the past. Certainly history has it's dull moments, but if you enjoy reading about political intrigue or war, history can be a better read than any fiction. One would think the rise and fall of the Ottoman Empire would give an author/historian the ability to produce a masterful work giving the material content, sadly, that is lacking. Finkel can't even make war and intrigue interesting. This is one of the most tedious history books I have ever read. Sure, it is loaded with facts, but with an incoherent writing style that jumps from place to place and concerns the reader with every non-important minute detail, it makes for a difficult read. I would not recommend this book."
2,Very Disappointed,I was expecting a literary and historical masterwork. I fell for the cover and the hyperbole of critics who I just can't believe actually waded through this disappointing chronology of Sultans... names without character... lists that leave us listless. It is a book I just couldn't help but put down; constantly returning to it with renewed hope that somehow a narrative would break through. Osman must have had a better dream. I'm still amazed at the undeserved praise this book received.
2,Osman's Dream: History of the Ottoman Empire by Caroline Finkel,"I began this book with great anticipation but was very disappointed. It was difficult to follow the author's stream of thought and the historical lines, i.e., date, years, decades were repetitive to the point of confusion. The characters moved in and out of the pages, seemingly without rhyme or reason. There was obviously an effort by the author to remove or dilute much of the historical evidence of violence associated with the Ottoman Empire. I completed this book only because I refuse not to finish a book once started."
2,Shallow political history,"I was quite disappointed by this book - its like a 19th century history with a shallow retelling of the names of Sultans, dates and major battles. I would have expected a greater analysis of the socio-cultural milieu in which the Ottoman empire arose and the institutions it spawned. I kept reading on hoping that this would follow but its really just a chronological listing of sultans, the major battles fought - if you want a political history of the empire, this may work for you. But when, why not just read the Wikipedia entry if you have no interest in the socio-political institutions."
3,Osman's Dream,"The relentless use of multiple dependent clauses in practically every sentence, makes this book twice as long as it needed to have been, and the superfluous details crammed into each sentence through dependent clauses, detracts greatly from main thrust of history."
3,Osman's Dream,"Comprehensive, but not always comprehensible. Irrelevant details cloud up unnecessarily dense paragraphs. Very weak on narrative, and little information about daily life in the Ottoman Empire."
2,Boring!!!!!,"I normally love thick history books but the author is a very boring writer. Nothing like David S. Landes, Jacques Barzun and Henry Commager Steel! Also, she has a linear narrative, starting with the supposed founding of the Ottoman Empire and ending with its fall. Boring!!The book would benefit from a discussion of the economic and religious reasons for the failure to modernize of an empire that threatened Vienna as late as 1683. Otherwise, the book is informative but again, boring!!!"
1,"I love Seibold and his music, but Ditch has to go","This is quite possibly the worst album Seibold has ever put out. Before releasing this album he did go on tour with Pigface. Maybe that tour took up all his time and he had nothing left for his new album, but in any case, Ditch down right stinks. I am probably one of the biggest Hate Dept fans and lovers of industrial music, so in writing this review do not think that I just don't understand industrial and can't appreciate it. If you do want to buy a Hate Dept album, I strongly recommend you get ""Omnipresent."""
3,Marty and Doc rule!,"Marty Mc Fly and Doc Brown are so much like their characters in the movie in this cartoon series that it's uncanny. The voices, the actions, all seem true to the 3 ""Back to the Future"" flicks. The movies were absolutely spectacular. Michael J. Fox also had a cartoon of his ""Teen Wolf"" flick. He's such a likable and popular star. Go to Universal Studies in Florida and ride the ""Back to the Future Ride"" ASAP!"
3,It's okay,"The ring isn't the right size. Although I love this ring, it doesn't fit. I had one before and one of the stones fell off, loved it so much ordered another one."
4,Fun but with errors in Bionicle Facts,"This game is fun but has horrible saving abilities, like, you beat a hard level, and save the game. Next time you get on the game, its not saved anymore. If you are a Bionicles fan, and know lots about the saga of Bionicle, you will find that this game has barely 20 facts about Bionicle correct. What is IN the game besides the facts and the saving is the environment and what you have to do in the game. This is what makes it worth getting. One of the incorrect facts is the names of some of the Bionicles."
2,Not fun at all,"This game was purchased for my 10-year-old brother who loves Bionicle, but even he got sick of the game in less than 10 minutes. The control of the character is horrible; you can never get the character to go in the direction you want him to. It took us five minutes just to make him face forward.I am an avid adventure gamer, and enjoy and have mastered many previous games, (Like The Mummy, Nancy Drew, etc) but I have yet to encounter a ""problem-solving"" situation in the Bionicle game. It's enough just to get your character over the first pit of lava. It's frustrating, and no one wants to even attempt to play anymore."
5,Bionicle,"This is a great game the people who say the controls are difficult are total liars! It's a fun game which follows the ""Bionicle The Movie"" story line the graphics are great and they have pop up bubbles to help you with some hard stuff in the game and they only pop-up a few times GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Admirable Work!,"P. Craig Russell has created a masterpiece of comic book out of a materpiece of Opera. A absolute delight in every opera fan's colelctions! (BTW, I love P. Craig Russell's other opera adaptions, but Ring of the Nibelung is the best by a mile)"
5,Smooth Jazz is just the Hits to sooth the soul,This seller deserves high praise for thisCD because it met specified descriptions as advertised.The CD is one I have not grown tired of over the many month since I purchased it.(Sorry for the delayed review)I highly recommend this seller. -Thanks!
1,Nice camera until you need service,"I enjoyed this camera for several weeks. Photos are good and it is small. However, it stopped working suddenly and I sent it in for service. After four weeks, it was returned to me with a handwritten note simply stating ""battery needs charging"". Of course, the camera still did not work. Stick with Sony or some other more reliable manufacturer. Also one of the downsides of dealing with an internet retailer----no one to talk to about the problem."
1,My S4i Failed right out of the box.,"I wish I could contact ""A customer from Miami"", because maybe his problem is the same as mine. I put in a fully charged battery, turned on the camera, took a couple of Pix, just to try it out and turned it off. Came back 2 hours later and the battery was dead, and the camera was warm. Recharged the battery, tried again and the same thing happened. Looks like something inside the camera is discharging the battery--Factory Defect. Now the good news is that I am returning it to the Internet seller and they've sent me a new one."
1,Terribly dissappointed,This camera was not inexpensive and takes mediocre photos. The flash doesn't reach most of my subjects and I get a lot of black photos back. Half the photos are blurry and I cannot get it to focus. You have to wait what seems like eternity between shots as it won't let you take a photo within 5-10 sec of each other. So sad :-( Taking a loss on this one and looking for something more consistent and reliable.Don't waste your money here.
5,one strong arm.,great space-saving option for your desk. very solid construction. easy installation but must follow instruction when adjusting / balancing the arm & monitor assembly. can handle my 20-inch monitor (check the specs of the arm of your interests as some may not support large monitors).
2,Too flimsy...,"After drilling a hole in my desk since the clamp would not fit, I found the monitor on the arm to be rather shaky. It seems the problem is a poor stabilization throughout the arm so any bump on the desk causes the monitor to shake like it is on Jello. I really can't recommend this product and suggest you keep looking for something else..."
5,delicious downtempo,"Solid Doctor is Steve Cobby - half of Fila Brazillia, the masters of Pork Recordings. These tracks are very phat, way large beats and some amazingly soulful samples. The 2 discs break down into very atmospheric downtempo and more dancefloor (though not your usual thumpathump techno by a long shot). Very highly recommended."
5,Pork does it again!!,"One of my all time favourite electronic downtempo cds!!! Check out anything on Pork recordings... Fila Brazillia especially... though this double cd pack is a must get for anyone who enjoys electronic music... lush, sexy and gorgeous soundscapes..."
3,Thought-Provoking But Not Necessarily the Answer For All,"I enjoyed reading Quest for Love and I think I would recommend it to a discerning reader looking for different perspectives about dating. I appreciated her words on opposite sex friendships, but I find it diffucult to agree with all she has to say. I would have liked to have seen more direct scriptural evidence for the point of view expressed in the book. At times, she seems to be stretching the scriptures she chooses to fit her beliefs. I know a number of wonderful Christian couples who did not follow Mrs. Eliot's advice and yet have healthy strong marriages. And I think that although the advice and ideas presented in the book are interesting and worth chewing over, they are not the answer for every Christian out there. Not a must read, but it is a quick read and worth the time."
5,Simply pleased :-),"I was very pleased with the speed of delivery and even more so with the book as a whole! It was very enlightening, even to the point of life-changing. I have since taken some of the things that I learned and applied them to my life. There were even a few tear jerking moments for me. If I didn't have to work and take care of the house I would've been done in a day or two. Worth every single penny! If you're trying to court/date in a Godly manner and need a faith energizer, these real life stories will definitely take you from faith to faith, and glory to glory! Best wishes to all those who read :-)"
3,"Great concept, poor engineering","I love the concept of the UFO. It is bright and can be seen from almost anywhere. However, the bracket that holds the UFO to the bike is poorly designed in my opinion. It is some what flimsy. I wish that the light (which is awesome) came with an improved bracket."
1,I am dissapointed enough...,"This light, was cool at first. I mean, it looks cool and works cool. But, the problem is, the water can easily leak into the light and cause it works in a weird way, which means the waterproof was bad with this light. It will flash itself when the water goes in especially during the rainy day until the battery dead out. Or, the push button on the top of the light can't work well.Conclusion, unless you have lot of money, don't buy this one and waste your time...I am one of the victim..."
2,"Small, and almost worthless during a bright day.","This tail light was not nearly as bright as I thought it would be. The size at night will make people misjudge the distance. During the day? Forget about it, it's almost invisible. The mounting bracket is a joke, loose as a goose on fiber. Uses odd sized batteries, might have a problem getting them just anywhere. Look for Cateye products, much better. More pricey, but can you put a pice on safety?"
1,Terrible Product Quality,"Dont trust this seller. THe product arrived with damaged packaging, missing instructions, and missing parts. Im surprised Amazon lets this seller continue representing their brand"
1,Don't bother,This light won't stay clipped on to the back of a Topeak rack (one of the major reasons I got the light and the rack). Everytime you hit a bump if the light doesn't fly off the batteries bounce and the light is turned off. Took off my Topeak rack and went back to my little seat bag and my Planet Bike flashing red light. What a waste of time and money.
1,It fell off the clip on second ride and is lost forever...,It fell off the clip on second ride and is lost forever... Can't return it without the light!!! Do not buy this.
4,Compatible rear light,I bought a Topeak bag a while back and it obscures a rear light I had on my seat stem. This clips in to the bag and it seems to be a bright light. All I can hope is that I'll be seen.
3,Thoroughly dry,"I checked this book out as destination reading before my trip to Belize. Peter Thomson was British High Commissioner for a time, so is well qualified to speak on his subject. Yet perhaps it is because he was a politician that his account is such a dry read. It's quite thorough but the language didn't have enough liveliness to prompt me to finish the book. It reads as if he is writing in an official capacity, and so cannot put more personality into it. It's also rather academic, something suggested in the forward."
3,Easy set up but not so easy printing,"Shipping and communication was great. The actual program was a little odd to use compared to others I've used in the past. The primary things that made it difficult was printing bout sheets and updated brackets. Each weight class bracket must be printed individually instead of being able to print an entire set of all weight classes at once. Also, the numbering of bouts was odd as each weight classes was numbered separately instead of the numbers running through all of the weight classes. This meant that an entire round for all weight classes cannot be printed all at once. Instead you must open up each weight class individually and print the round for that weight class only and then do this again for each weight class (14 for the tounament we ran). The other thing that needs improvement is the bye matches are not automatically ""scored."" Instead you must manually award a win to the wrestler with a bye instead of it being automatically awarded."
2,They Shouldn't Have to Try This Hard,"I'll make this review as simple as possible. The secret to Erasure's success has been simple. Simple lyrics, sweet melodies, and a syntho-pop sound that has yet to be duplicated. Erasure has had the knack of incapsulating a sweet as sugar harmony into a rythmic blend of greatness. That being said, this Erasure offering is way off base. They've exchanged the charm and happiness apparent on ""Cowboy"" and ""I say, I say, I say"", and turned out a dreary, depressingly melodic, bore, and that's not what makes Erasure great. There are a few that may catch your attention. Freedom was a logic choice for the first single, its the only track with a hook chorus. Moon and the Sky is also a nice track, but the rest of this offering is so un-Erasure it's truely disheartening."
2,Don't board this boat,"Concur with the reviewer who was very disappointed with the sound quality of Penchant to Dream. That was the only song where Andy Bell's amazing voice could potentially be utilized, but the mix came out like a bad load of laundry: static-y and murky.For some reason critics like this album. However, its abysmal chart performance in the UK and US reflects its true nature. It is extremely mediocre and put me to sleep. Sounded like Clay Aiken droning to over-produced drivel.The best Erasure album is I Say, I Say, I Say."
4,a book for all ecologists,"This is a well written and well researched book. We may feel that Francis and Clare of Asissi, who lived in the 13th century, are irrelevant to the present time. However, as shown in this book, the values they espoused, of equality, peace and partnership in all relationships are equally important in the ""Dot.com"" age. The book is not just for Religious but is a valuable starting block for self development. The section on self knowledge is thought provoking. ""Who am I"" is quite often a difficult question to answer frankly. We now acknowledge that Francis was the first ecologist, with a profound respect for all created things, in which he saw God the Creator. This book shows us very clearly that we do not inherit the earth from our forebears, we do in fact borrow it from our children. It is a very good read. I enjoyed it. It is also very competitivly priced and would make a nice Christmas gift."
3,She was a fiesty woman of the 1960's.,"They don't make them like Malvina Reynolds anymore. She had something to say and she found a way to say it. Malvina was such an acerbic writer of social commentary songs, and then concurrently probably one of the best children's songs writer. She was only commercially known for ""Little boxes"" and ""Morningtown Ride,"" yet I think that her songs in the children's ablum ""Rabbits Dance"" sung by Marcia Berman (beautiful voice) of the ""Magic Penny"" award fame (also a Malvina song) is my favorite childrens album. Malvina's voice is a little harsh for easy listening. That's the main reason it only got 3 stars. The other reason is that some of these songs are pure protest songs, and unless you are a supporter of her cause(s), you probably wouldn't like the album at all."
1,Sick!,My son saw this video & I am appalled! This is sick stuff! Broken arms & unconscious skaters! Where is the world going?
4,Snail Mail No More,"I read the book Snail Mail No More. This book is a sequel to P.S. Longer Letter Later. I really liked this book because there were many unexpected events that happened throughout the story. I also really liked how it was written in diary form.This book was about two girls who moved away a while back and continue to write letters to each other until they get e-mail. Then they e-mail back and forth telling each other what's happening in their lives with their friends and family. There are many twists and turns that the girls must face. With the help of each other, will they get through it? You'll find out if you read this book."
3,A bit weak but a good read,"I read ps longer letter later (i found it on my bookshelf) and I really liked it. It moved me quite emotionally. This book goes on to tell the 8th grade yr of the two correspondents Elizabeth and Tara*Starr. Elizabeth visits Tara and the two catch up each other on old news. When Elizabeth's visit is over, she continues to correspond with Tara through email. The girls relationship strengthens as Elizabeth's father has worse drinking problems and keeps harrassing his family. Elizabeth is constanly emailing Tara about her life with her friends, family, and school. They even talk about topics normal girls would talk about: unfair parents, boys, dances, clothes etc. Unfortunately something horrible happens to Elizabeth who turns to Tara for help. The girls need each other more then ever. Will Elizabeth break away from the good life she has managed to build in the following months of her father's departure or will she remain to emailing Tara?"
4,Differences,"Snail Mail no More is about two young teens, Tara Starr Lane and Elizabeth who are separated when one of them moves to Ohio. They were the best of friends and it was terribly sad for the both of them. In Danziger's first book in this series, P.S Longer Letter Later, the two friends must keep contact with each other by using snail mail(regular mail). But in this book their families purchase computers so they can keep contact in e-mails! Tara Starr Lane is incredibly outgoing and energetic, and loves sparkly clothes and jewels and Elizabeth likes to keep to herself and pays no attention to clothes. They are so totally different, but somehow they manage to remain friends. Read a book full of funny e'mails sad e's and regular e's. I think you'll enjoy this book!"
4,Great book but NOT for elementary school age,"While I really liked this book and appreciated the opportunities it opens to discuss big topics including underage drinking and alcoholism, I highly question the suggested age range of 8-12. My 8 year old is certainly not ready to be reading about 8th graders trying out alcohol (and throwing up) and not ready to handle processing that one girl's dad dies in a drunk driving crash at the end. Not to mention that it blows the whole Santa thing out of the water - a revelation I don't think many parents of 3rd graders want to come out in a book from their school library, as it did for me.I am sure this would be a fabulous book for a middle school-age child, I just don't think it belongs in materials my third-grader can check out."
5,snail mail no more,"The book is about friends and family e-mailing each other. There are two girls, Tara and Elizabeth. They e-mail each other about what's going on thier life. The part I liked most in the book was when Elizabeth and Tara e-mailed each other because e-mailing someone is fun.I like the part when Elizabeth wants to go visit Tara and her family. Page #4 is my favorite because Elizabeth's mom says that July is a good time for Elizabeth to go to visit Tara. Tara wants to make a party for Elizabeth and have fun with her family. The book was ....so....so fun and a cool book. I don't have any questions about it. I recommend this book because is cool and fun. Some pages are sad, but I liked it so much anyway."
3,Well...,"I'd have to say this was a good book, and I really love the series, but I think P.S. Longer Letter Later was better. I didn't like the e-mailing as much as the actual letters, and I think it got kind of boring when they would e-mail each other from the same house. However, I personally like writing actual letters- but i do like e-mail. THere is a big surprise at the end. Also, I think it drags in some parts. All in all, I would recommend this book but I think that PS Longer Letter Later is better."
1,Book may be great-voices of readers AWFUL!!!,"I bought this audiobook on the recommendation of a friend. I have no idea if the book is any good at all, because the voices of the readers, who happen to be the authors, are HORRIBLE. Their attempts to imitate the voices of teenagers are painful to listen to. I didn't even make it through the first tape. The publisher should have sprung for professional readers instead of these two-who not only sound 40-plus years old, but also as though they have never set foot off of Long Island, their accents are THAT thick. HORRIBLE. Read the book, don't try to listen to these annoying voices."
1,READ THIS,"Elizabeth's dad dies in the end! Drunk driving - who'd have thunk it? They spent hundreds of pages leading up to it. Lots of foreshadowing.Some cat advice snuck in by Ann Martin.Lazy Paula thinks her character is still in the 7th grade, although this the second book of what will surely be a series of 125, was meant to take place during the girls' 8th grade year.I'm sure the duo will pump out one more book before shelling out outlines to some poor hapless authors to actually write.On the plus side, I couldn't put it down - then again it's not mind expanding literature."
1,YAWN,"This book was aweful! My title just means that it makes you want to yawn! I hated this book and although the girls in the book seemed realistic, I hate listening to ""are you still going to be my best friend?"" and ""I'm grounded! OH MY GOSH!"" This book is not for people over 10 years old."
4,A Journey From Girl to Woman,"I loved the book Up A Road Slowly by Irene Hunt. I thought the story of Julie Trelling growing from a spoiled child to a gentle and kind young woman was very beautiful and touching. When Julie is first sent to live with her Aunt Cordellia after her mother died, she is a tomboy with a mind of her own. As the book progresses, Julie begins to grow up and view her world in a different way.This book is great because it shows growing into womanhood the way it is: hard. Irene Hunt didn't make Julie seem like she always was perfect like some books make their main charactors. I would recomend this book to anybody over the age of ten."
3,my name is BIG rv and i think this book was alright,We had to read this book in school and i thought it was a so-so book.i liked the begining but not really the end.i probly wouldn't recommend this because my friends have already read it.Skateboarding rules
3,I didn't really understand the book,"I didn't really understand the book. I think that Irene Hunt should make more books. I think you should read it if she has a baby boy or girl. If you like realistic fiction books you should read, ""A Road Up Slowly."""
1,up a road slowly,the book was really long and stupid. we were forced to read it our reading teacher mrs.K has every class ervery year read this borring snoozathon.
1,this book suxs,this book was really bad i didnt like it at all. we read it for school and it was boring
2,Ok,Ok I honestly don't think that the book was that good really it was not the best book I've read but it was ok
4,A Novel To Remember,"If I must decide, I think this book, Up A Road Slowly, deserves four stars. Each new chapter seemed as if it was opening a new chapter of my life. This novel was about a young girl names Julie; this story tells about her heartache and happiness. I rene Hunt trluy enchants a reader with her writing. I would recommend this wonderfully written book to all readers who want to be amazed, along with many others Hunt has beautifully constructed."
5,Irene Hunt makes life beautiful,"I lent this book to my (former) best friend and never got it back! If that isn't a testament to how great this book is, what is? Since then I hunted down a copy of Up A Road Slowly again because it is a book you never forget. It is full of grace, beauty and a sense of timelessness. Even if your years of growing up were (are) a mess best left forgotten, you will love sharing Julie's years with her. All those things you noticed in life that no one ever caught the true essence of before, Irene Hunt does. If you like the depth and lovely characterization of shoujo manga (I know you are out there, right?) you will love this book! One of my three all time favorites."
5,A great book for young aspiring literary minds!,"As a college English major struggling with my own writing process and writing about memories from my childhood, I still go back to this book for what Julie learns from her Uncle Haskell about writing--write what you know. This is just a great book about growing up and finding one's own voice, moral views, and inner worth. I have read books by many great writers, but it is books like this that I will always cherish."
4,"This book is a gentle, wise portrait of growing up.","I'm sorry Up A Road Slowly is out of print. I had wanted to purchase it for my niece's bat mitzvah. The book is a lovely, wise, gentle portrait of growing up, the complexities of love, and the goodness of people - as well as being a compelling story. Up A Road Slowly is the kind of book you can read more than once - that is high praise."
4,This is a great book!!,Hello my name is Julie and I am a student at West Virginia State University. I am taking a Children's Literature course where I had to read a Newbery Novel and this is the novel that I read. This story was very touching. I loved reading about Julie's growth and development. I would recommend this book to anyone but I am not sure if I would have my classroom read this book because it really would not reach every child in the room. Probably mostly the girls would relate. I would buy a copy of this book and have it on my book shelf.
4,An Outstanding Recording! - WE WANT MORE!,"""In The Wilde"" by The Roadbirds is a CD that belongs in the collection of every folk/rock/blues/roots music lover in the world. Since they put on such a dynamic show in person, I thought The Roadbirds were a band that is best experienced live until I heard this recording. One take, no overdubs or electronic wizardry, one of the absolute best-sounding CDs I own. And the songs are very enjoyable, with my favorites being ""18 Summers"" and ""A Thousand Times""- both penned by Patrick McGinley, long considered one of the best of the new breed of singer/songwriter. Only 4 stars due to the six-song length, ""In The Wilde"" leaves us all wanting more!"
2,"Good information, but not very thrilling.","I bought this for use in my classroom, and only the most dedicated science lovers bother to play with it more than once. The information is good, but it just isn't very exciting. Oh well."
2,not as good as it looks,"Bought for my 8 year old, not much to do as far as activities, a lot of information only."
5,"Love Tim Hockenberry, this is the second CD I have","Love it, Love it, Love it! I love the way the music is rearranged. I like this version and Tim's voice so much more than the origina artist. What a great idea to redo the songs. Love the raspy, sexy voice!"
1,I fear my least favourite set of Dylan covers,"I bought this item with several other Dylan cover compendiums - given the other reviews posted I was expecting something special I must admit.Having now listened several times I find this to be one of the worst set of Dylan covers I have purchased. The sparse and laid back arrangements might just pass muster but I fear what I cannot get to enjoy despite numerous listening is Tim Hockenberry's voice, which is what I can only best describe as someone sounding like Joe Cocker with a sore throat.I fear the whole CD ended up grating with me every time I played it and so I have now donated my copy to my local charity shop for resale."
4,This thermometer is simple to use for anyone ...,"This thermometer is simple to use for anyone (young, old, or in-between). It's battery operated (comes ready to use) and has auditory signals to tell you when your temperature has been taken. It beeps until it's finished testing, which is really good for kids. Kids will be able to use this and know when they can remove it from their mouths. The only bad thing is that if you don't hold it exactly in the right place in your mouth, the test doesn't work as well, but it does tell you when you don't have it placed correctly. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a simple to use thermometer."
5,Baby King Shampoo Shield,"This has been life changing for us! My son likes baths again! We couldn't live without his ""magic hat"" as he calls it!"
5,I hope they release all of The Muppet Show episodes!,"If you are my age (33) and watched The Muppet show as a kid, I am sure you are going to love it just as much or maybe even more! When you realize the work and artistry that went into each episode and the Muppets, you appreciate the show even more! It is touching how Brian Henson gives introductions for the episodes, there are 3 on this disc, plus some bonus clips.I am a John Denver fan as well and hope that Brian Henson brings all of The Muppet Show episodes to VHS and DVD for this generation and our children. My son loves the Muppets and I am so glad to be able to share with him something I loved as a child with him. Thanks Jim in Heaven! Thanks to Brian Henson for continuing your dads legacy for all kids and for me! Thanks to all of the Muppets!"
5,Truly deserving of this title!,"This set truly deserves this title. The segment where Harry Belafonte sings ""Turn the World Around"" with all the Muppets- including the grumpy old men(!) singing along has to be the greatest moment in Muppet history! I think most Muppet fans will agree. The John Denver segment has it's moments too, and while the Linda Ronstadt segment is not up to the other two, there is really no such thing as a completely bad Muppet Show.It would be nice if the Alice Cooper episode, with the stuffy eagle having a fit over the freakish one, and the Milton Berle episode, where the heckling old men go toe to toe with Uncle Miltie, would also see the light of day.The genius of the Muppets and Jim Henson was their ability to appeal to both kids and adults at the same time, unlike much of the Sid and Marty Kroft stuff and the New Zoo Revue and their descendant Barney who will make anyone over three years old run to the Pepto-Bismol! This DVD is a fine example of what I mean."
4,2 out of three ain't bad,"This disk is worth having just for the Harry Belafonte episode. It's FABULOUS, and includes music worth introducing to children.The Linda Ronstadt episode is very flat. I love The Cat Came Back- but that's about it. Linda's numbers are downright boring, and not very Muppet-y.The John Denver episode is lovely, but not like the Belafonte episode. Even if they don't put out all the Muppet episodes- and I wish they would- I would at least like a collection of teh John Denver Episodes. This is the one with Grandma's Featherbed and Inch By Inch. It also has a rendition of the Happy Wanderer done by Muppets that I adore."
3,What We Expect of Him,"The title is perhaps misleading. If you read only one book about Shakespeare, perhaps it should not be this one. There are others that give a better introduction to his peculiar appeal. But if you want to know about cultural icons - how they are born, how they mature and die - then you could hardly do better. Shakespeare is, after all, among literary figures the icon of icons (perhaps only Homer can compare). And Bates does a delightful job of sketching just how it all came to be - what we have come to expect of Shakespeare, what sort of dreams and visions we map onto him. And he does it without losing sight of the fact that Shakespeare may indeed deserve all our admiration, even if not always in the form or for the reasons that we suppose."
2,Nothing original here,"I guess there's not much NEW to say about William Shakespeare, the Stratford man. The case for his being the author of the works we know and love was presented so much more interestingly in Will in the World. I suggest you read that. If you really want to have fun, read the case for the Earl of Oxford in Shakespeare By Another Name."
4,Very helpful,I found the book to be very thorough and comprehensive. The author obviously has been in the business a long time and knows how to share the information she has learned.
1,REQUIRES ASSEMBLY,"Not a big deal, but the product features are inaccurate. I contacted Amazon and they refuse to change the wording. It says ""no assembly required."" It requires two tools to assemble this table. Amazon makes no sense when I contact them and they say their description is correct even though I emailed them a photo with the tools on the table. What is wrong with Amazon customer support these days?"
2,Same problem as some problems,"One of the nuts used to attach the table top to the legs was defective. Fortunately, I was able to get the bolt to catch enough to hold securely. Should it fail, a fix isn't that difficult. Still, there is a definite lack of quality control. I notice the price has tanked - perhaps Amazon is tired of returns and is selling off inventory.A shame because it's otherwise a quality product.For what i paid, two stars."
1,Some Problems,"I also experienced a defect issue. One of the nuts required for assembly was stripped. The nuts are pressed intro the wood so impossible to just run over to the hardware store for a new one. Had to return it, am hoping the replacement unit does not exhibit the same problemStrathwood Kapur Wood Folding Bistro Table"
4,Nice little table.,"The table arrived in 2 days. I really like the looks and it seems to be well made. Easy assembly. A couple of bolts, washers and 4 screws. Faster to put together than to remove the packaging. Looks really good with the folding Kaput wood chairs."
5,An amazing price for this quality table,"I can not believe what a good-looking solid table this is for the price. I was lucky to catch it a special price of $29.99. It is very easy to assemble and looks great with the 2 wooden chairs I have. Its a perfect size for 2 people seated around it. I have it partially under cover outside and it gets full sun in the morning. So far, it has weathered extremely well in the Florida Keys."
4,pretty table,Very nice table- is solid and pretty. Arrived in great condition. I also have the matching chairs. The only thing I would change is that the table is a little tall. Seems that it would coordinate better with the chairs if it were a little lower.
5,Very nice,"Great, well made little table. Easy to put together and very stable. The whole set is very nice. Perfect for our outdoor patio. Can be easily folded away."
4,Good Value,"I purchased this bistro table with the coffee table to complete my set of Strathwood Kapur wood outdoor furniture. It's not teak, but it's a good value."
1,No Assemby Instructions,"The product looks well made. However, the insert directs you to go to Strathwoodfurniture.com for assembly instructions. Assembly does not look easy. The website has no such instructions nor contact information. I am a widow that was looking forward to these tables, now I have to pack them up and send them back to Amazon. All because the company was too cheap to insert one piece of paper!"
3,Good introduction to Windows 2000 but no meat,"A good, well written introduction to Windows 2000 but no meat. Windows 2000 beta from Microsoft press in combination with Mastering Active Directory (Mastering),"" Robert R. King is a better choice for LAN Admins and tech people."
2,Avoid in most cases,"Based on the contents of this book, Microsoft should be giving it away rather than selling it. We don't mean that comment to be an extreme criticism but it just doesn't make sense to charge so much for something that is essentially a glorified sales manual.It's definitely easy to read but also probably too easy. You'll finish reading this book and find yourself asking, ""Is that all?"" Don't even attempt to bring this book along as a resource when you go to deploy Windows 2000.If does serve a purpose of preparing people in sales roles for product. If used for that, it does the job quite well. However for most other uses, you'll definitely find better books."
3,Easy to read intro but too expensive,"I read this book in a day. It's a good overview of what's new in Windows 2000 Server but not terribly deep. However, it is overpriced for what it is -- MS Press should just have combined this book with the one on 2000 Workstation and knocked ten bucks off. Also, it's kinda clear there isn't much revolutionary in 2000 Server anyway. Windows is finally catching up with things Netware has done for years and mainframes for decades."
3,later vintage,I was disapointed to discover that these were not recordings from the period of Zarah's prime.I simply wish this could be more clearly stated when one cannot hear audio samples.It is still an entertaining collection however.
3,too simplistic,"This book is just too simplistic on the archetypes of the Majors and leaves you wanting more. It does tend to have a pagan slant but the real problem is 4 archetypes are rather obvious; they are basic reverses of each other and not really built on the astrological aspects of the cards but how Kate feels about them. Probably the worst part is she really gives few exercises, spreads, on how to release their power or overcome their negativity. She just rambles on. Mary Greer's Court Book is really much better."
4,The Tarot Court Cards - Book,I just received this in the mail today & like verymuch what I see. I believe it will help me a lotwith the Court Cards which I have a lot of troublewith... I really like the way the book is laid outand find it very easy to find the card I want...Would recommend to anyone having trouble like I dowith the Court Cards...
3,nice but not what i was expecting...,"well maybe i looked at the product name wrong because i was expecting 16 - 1/2"" hangerSSSSSSS. still don't get it? this is just ONE really NICE chrome hanger. that is 16 and a half inches in length. oops."
2,Only one hanger,"Just in case anyone makes the same mistake I did, this listing is for one hanger, not sixteen. Seems a bit pricey for ONE hanger."
3,I agree with LizziePoo,"I too was duped into the thought of sixteen 1/2"" hangers. I was a little surprised to find a 16.5 inch wide hanger. While this was a good product, the title needs to be adjusted. If the title is not adjusted, the price needs to be. A good product, but not worth nearly ten dollars."
3,LizzieLoo,"I made the same mistake LizziePoo! I think the name (hangers - plural!!) is misleading and the picture looks like it is two hangers as well.As for quality - they are ok. The clips don't open very wide, however, so it is difficult getting thick items in the clip."
5,New to Rebounding,"I first used this video back in February when I went to Hallelujah Acres to learn how to get healthy!I think this is a workout I can actually stick to - I just wish I'd bought the DVD in February.It took a couple of sessions before I felt like I could keep up with Carol. This DVD is meant to be used over and over, so you'll eventually learn the moves.Once I got the moves down, I started noticing the lyrics to the music. They are rather cheesy and I about fell off my rebounder, I was laughing so hard.As for rebounding itself, it really helped with my migraines/headaches. I was in a lot of pain one afternoon and after following Carol's workout, I was completely better."
2,No Bounce No Play,"Carol means well. These exercises are meant for people with health problems, which she claims rebounding will greatly help. Perhaps it will help people with arthritis, etc., but it doesn't do much for me. I bought the wrong video. That having been said, the video has a home made quality to it. For example, when we should be seeing her feet as she describes a certain move, we're looking at her smiling face. Not good. Also, I resent her sales pitch for her own (vastly) superior rebounder."
3,Transition is sloppy,"I enjoy Carol's fresh, positive attitude and the routine is excellent for a beginner. The transition from one exercise to another is basically non-existant and you're constantly trying to catch up. The aerobics portion is fast footwork and I find myself trying to catch up or just doing it at my own pace."
2,Disappointed,"Carol puts a plug in the beginning to sell her own rebounder. Tacky.This dvd was a chore to get through instead of fun. Actually, I did not even finish it. There are so few rebound videos to choose from and I still have not found one that is inspiring or fulfilling."
1,Not what I expected,"Quality of this video was pretty lame, sound was not great. I would not consider this a beginners bouncing video, would not recommend."
5,This was a great way to learn to make sushi at home!,"Terrific DVD for learning to make sushi at home. This was a good alternative to the confusing and frustrating sushi book I bought. I thought this video did an excellent job of clearly explaining the entire process - from describing all of the Asian products to use, to selecting fish, to how to cut the fish, to the proper way to make the rice and walking you through each step for making a good varitey of sushi. This was a lot of fun to do - an awesome date or party activity!Also, having a DVD made it really easy to go back and review steps because there's a good detailed menu you can select from."
5,Great Gift and Fun at Home!!!,"I originally bought the complete kit from the SushiPartyBox website, which included the DVD. I thought it was a terrific deal for all that I received and it definitely feeds a group of six and then some. My fiancee bought another video as a gift for a friend of ours from Amazon - oddly Amazon's price is cheaper for the DVD than direct. The video is meant for sushibeginners - it is not for advanced sushi experts by any means. In about 30 minutes we learned everything there is to know about rolling your typical sushi rolls. I recommend it if you are getting started and don't have immediate aspirations to become a sushi chef. Good fun!"
5,Some say this is THE BEST hot sauce!,"This line of hot sauces was found on every table, during our trip to Belize, and I have looked at every supermarket I visit at home for Marie Sharp's brand, to no avail. Finally, found it on Amazon and ordered 4 different types. They came well packaged, in a timely fashion and those in my household who use hot sauce at almost every meal are thrilled! We live in an area with lots of Hispanic markets and a sea of spicy sauces and foods available, but not Marie Sharp's. It's wonderful: ""heat with a little sweet"". Made in and exported by the tiny country of Belize, I recommend you give it a try. Amazon usually has special deals when ordering several bottles at a time."
3,Oh no! It's different!,"I've used this Wrinkle Defense Creme for years and have always loved it. But it seems Avalon has changed their formula and I don't think I'll be using it anymore. It's nowhere near as creamy - it doesn't glide on nicely anymore and it seems you need more than usual to spread it around on your face & neck. Sorry Avalon, in this case, ""new & improved"" just doesn't cut it."
4,"Coq10 wrinkle defense creme, Perfect for my light sensitive skin",I am happy I found this product. Most creams are heavy and irritant. I usually use Clinique products for my sensitive skin. This is much lighter and absorbent.The pump shape and size are my only negatives. It constanly falls over and looses its cap if you are not careful. Plus the amount is minimal. Unsure if a tube would be better.
1,False Advertising,"I ordered what was described on this webpage, but unfortunately the description neglects to mention the SPF component of this product. I was sent this product, but it actually has titanium dioxide in it for SPF purposes and if you want the Creme without that you need to get the nighttime version. The nano particles of titanium dioxide are not without dangers, so I suggest buying the other version and get a titanium dioxide-free sunscreen (1,2). Or, since this brand does not have an accurate product description, go with a more responsible company. I do not have much time to shop for cremes like this and was a little displeased I had to go through returning this product and finding a replacement when the product description could have been more accurate.I am now using 100% Pure Coffee Cherry Sun Damage Corrective Cream or 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream, AAA Shea Butter's Cocoa-Nut Creme, and Reviva's Ten Percent Glycolic Acid Night Creme."
1,Has SPF!!,"I ordered this product without checking the ingredients and label on the company's website. When I recieved this product, it had a label that also mentioned SPF, but the amazon page does not mention it at all! You can see that it has SPF on this webpage:[...]While I do not mind certain kinds of SPF products, this one has titanium dioxide on the updated label, which is not a good bet as far as SPF goes! I am surprised this page has not been updated and was not happy about having to shop for a new product and go through return shipping hassles and finding a different product that might include the nighttime version of this product.Webpages describing titanium dioxide health dangers:1. [...]2. [...]"
1,it turns your face white,"The face cream turns your face white. You cant use it unless you want to look ill. I have used this face lotion without the SPF and love it, too bad this formula just is not attractive."
2,Want the version WITHOUT the SPF!!,I loved loved loved the old version (without the SPF). I've been buying the old version for years - it was the lightest and best moisterizer I've ever used! Because of the added ingredients - the new version is much heavier and has a bad consistency :-(. I wish I could still find the old version...
2,caused dry red splotches...,Maybe it's because I used it without the other Avalon Organics products but the Wrinkle Defense Creme gave me dry red splotches. I have sensitive skin so I want to warn others with the same. The redness disappeared as soon as I stopped using the product and I was unable to determine what effect it might have on lines and wrinkles...
1,jen,I really loved this product before they added the spfI am very sensitive to ingredientsand am sad I can no longer get the stuff I love
2,Pumps no good without a straw/tube,"I've used Avalon products before and been pretty pleased. I've seen other reviews about the formula changing, and yes, it is a bit thicker and seems stronger smelling. Those things I am not too concerned about but its really annoying to pay for a product with a pump on it that has no interior straw/tube for the pump, and trying to get it out by just pounding on container is like trying to get Heinz ketchup to come out of the bottom of a bottle. Will think twice before ordering again."
1,Would give 0 stars if I could.,"I purchased a pump bottle of this, nothing comes out no matter how much you pump it, and there is no way to get the top off. I don't even know if there is any creme in there at all. Will never purchase anything from Avalon again. Don't know if they are a scam or just don't know how to make pump bottles but it is really frustrating."
4,Riviting and entertaining,"First of all, this book is deceptively thin (note 128 pages in publisher's description). However, it is set in more traditional smaller type without empty filler spaces, so my impression after reading is one of a full and satisfying novel. Having read many Holmes re-creations, I find the most unique aspect here is Dr. Watson's active participation and even excitement at joining the ""game afoot""; we often wonder about the relationship between Holmes and Watson, and why Watson would care to pursue it if he were treated as an eternal ingénue in the shadow of Holmes' genius. None of that here.There are a few flaws. Without creating spoilers, I find a few of the introductory deductions obvious. And, later, both Holmes and Watson completely miss a conclusion they should have guessed. But the basic premise of the story is most enjoyable and makes one wonder about the truth of ""history."""
2,"Okay, but not more than okay","When I bought my lawn tractor, my two preschool-aged boys seized upon its instructional video. Two years later, they both still watch that silly thing regularly. They just love it. They sit still and quiet to learn once more about starting the mower, getting an even cut, and unclogging the bagging chute. The tractor video made them notice farm tractors and even construction equipment more and more. So I figured they'd enjoy a video about construction equipment.Given that the boys put this video into the VCR about once a day, it's clear that they like the *idea* of this video. But they invariably lose interest in it after ten minutes or so. It could be that the distant shots of these large machines don't grab their attention. Also, it could be that the character voices given each machine sometimes seem disconnected from the machine."
2,Ruined by tripod,"This telescope's potential is ruined by the tripod. With a decent tripod my kids could enjoy the product. The tripod is so shoddy it fell apart during the first use. Unfotunately, it doesn't look like you can remount the telescope on a standard tripod.What a waste."
1,Vega Telescope,"This was a terrible purchase. We took it out of the boxand the weak point is the tripod. You couldn't get ittight enough to be stable for a child to look through it.The other thing to note, even though it was purchasedthrough Amazon, the vendor Fat Brain will only give youstore credit if the box is opened.They are very nice and polite, but still beware that thetypical Amazon 30 day deal does not work with all outsidevendors."
2,Sorry tripod,"The telescope itself is OK, although a bit distorted viewing images. But that tripod is a piece of crap. Instead of My granddaughter having a happy time at her birthday, she ended up crying because the tripod broke almost immediately. I looked at the internal parts of the leg adjustment where it broke and could not believe the cheap flimsy plastic locking mechanism. I paid 100$ for this instrument. I could have bought an Orion for 129$ . And it would have been built right.Please build a better product. Don't let the kids cry."
4,Venus And Other Hits,Hi I'm glad I bought this album because it has all my favorite songs on it that I remember from the 80's.
2,Low Quality,"Very low quality. Stitching was loose, leather was thin. Doesn't feel like it would hold up longer than a month."
4,Great lightweight clip! One minor complaint.,"Great quality clip. Everything looks sleek and fancy. Could hold six (6) cards really tightly, two in each pocket. But I prefer using 5 cards so there's more room for everything to breathe. My only minor complaint is the magnet clip, it could be a little bit stronger. It could firmly hold around 3 or 4 bills and under. Once you go over that, the magnet becomes weaker. So if you're someone who likes to hold many singles, twenties, etc, don't buy this clip."
4,DOPP Magnetic Money Clip & Card Holder,Nice look and good construction. I am concerned about how well the magnetic money clip will hold bills. Time will tell.
4,Compact currency carrier,"The money clip works great. I was looking for a clip that wasn't metal or might tear up the inside of my pocket. This product works great. It holds the two cards I use on a regular basis. I'm past the point in life where I want to carry around the ""Costanza"" wallet. So this little guy did the trick. Yes the clip doesn't hold a fat wad of cash. But one probably shouldn't be carrying around a fat wad of cash on a regular basis."
5,Gift for Husband,"After purchasing several money clips, I finally got it right with this one. He loves it!"
5,Great quality - completely pleased.,This is exactly what I had been looking for & couldn't ever seem to find in stores. Quality is great. Item is exactly as described & my husband loves it!
4,"He says he's ""happily pleased""","I purchased this money clip for my fiance. He says he loves it! When I asked him for suggestions for the title for the review his response was he is ""happily pleased"". He says he only wishes it had more slots for his cards. The money clip only has two slots so he only can put two credit cards and ID. He says the magnet clip will hold about 6cash bills folded over. We are well pleased with this purchase."
3,"Fairly good, looks better in picture though.","Don't get me wrong, it is not that bad, but looks better in the picture. On the bright side it is really compact, magnets work very well. Time will say how sturdy it is. Maybe should be $5 cheaper :-) After I bought it I found cheaper and better in department store."
2,Weak Magnet,"It does not hold many bills in the magnetic clip, which is a bummer. Otherwise, it is a well made little wallet and attractive."
2,Average,"It arrived with a loose thread hanging out that I had to cut off. I don't have much faith in the stitching holding out for very long, although I'm capable of restitching it myself-but I shouldn't have to. My main beef is the price, something like 15-20$. This is a cheap piece of junk that should cost $5. At $5, I could live with them lasting 2 months and I would buy a couple of them as replacements. There aren't many low profile wallets like this listed and the magnet is sturdy enough to keep the bills in place. My main issue is really the durability, which doesn't seem to be there, although I've only had it a couple of days."
2,Demagnetizer,"I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific Vacation Cruise. It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed: One, It will only hold about six bills and Two, it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days. Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards, I removed them from the Card Holder. I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again."
2,Doesn't hold bills....,"Magnetic clip simply does not hold bills as is intended. It is too weak and . . . wallet should be redesigned. The leather is very nice, size is great. But BOTTOM LINE: if it doesn't hold bills securely, it is not useable as a wallet."
1,"Poor quality, coming apart",This was suppose to be a gift and was not able to give it because tree was a tear in it. Stitching loose. Very disappointed.
2,The magnet is too week more like for one bill.,The design is cool and it looks great. Very neat but it does not hold many bills is place. Hold a bill or two perfectly if fold one time. If you carry 5 or bills its a waste of time. The magnet does not hold and your money might fall out if you don't hold it is place when you pull out your wallet
5,Excellent gun!,The gun works perfectly. Exactly how you would expect it to work. Very fast Prime and greasing.
5,"Item was canceled, never received",I'll give it a 5 star even though I never received it. We have one here at work and it is awesome.
5,A classic of legal analysis -- and a joy to read.,"This is a classic of legal analysis, and a joy to read. Leff has a lucid prose style and a very interesting idea: that the line between ""fraud"" and ""sales"" is much less clear than either lawyers or consumers might think. Leff explains how the art of the deal consists of convincing buyers of exactly the same kinds of things that the art of fraud often involves. He leaves you with a new appreciation for the complexities, and sometimes incoherence, of much consumer regulation. This is not in any way a libertarian rant, or an argument against rules but rather a recognition that life is very complicated and a reminder of problems that won't go away"
5,Excellent!!!,Fast Delivery!! Excellent cologne!! I just wish it was a bigger bottle so it would last longer!! Love the smell!! Thank you!!
3,"Good selection, poor commentary","As an admirer of this form and of Zen, I am delighted by the selection but not impressed by the commentary. Since Buddhism and Zen both have influenced death poetry so strongly, one would have hoped that the editor would have shown some appreciation of the subtleties of both. Unfortunately, the view of Buddhism is sadly out-dated and fundamentally mistaken. Hoffman misses the essence of emptiness and talks fatuously and anachronistically of ""the void"". The meaning of death poems written by Zen monks, but also by Japanese poets then becomes distorted by this nihilistic interpretation of Buddhism. So, delight in the poems themselves but skip the introduction and commentary. For a better collection including some Chinese death poems, see the excellent collection ""Penguin Book of Zen Poetry"" by Lucien Stryk, Takashi Ikemoto."
2,Could have been better,"I think that this book had the potential to be better than it is. Many of the poems are amazing. Of particular interest were the poems of the Zen masters. Their death poems show a lifelong dedication to searching for enlightenment and the final fruition of a philosophy where the difference between life and death is meaningless. The summaries of the lives and deaths of many of the poets provide an interesting illustration of the culture of the Japanese poets. However, I was less impressed by the work of the so called ""haiku poets"" many of these men were not masters of their craft and it is obvious in their death poems. Also the introduction is full of interesting information, but is quite dry considering the unusual subject matter of the book would seem to offer endless possibilities for an interesting commentary."
1,"If you buy, buy new.",This is a great anthology of poems. I consider it a must have for anyone who has even a passing interest in eastern poetry. My one complaint is that the copy I received was listed as Very Good and was barely passable as Poor. Disappointing.
3,Poor communication of size,"I ordered a 7"" oval pipe for a 7"" oval stove. When this arrived it was way to big, even to modify. It must have started as a 7"" round that got shaped into an oval that just wouldn't fit. Probably a misunderstanding. I kept it instead of paying return shipping cost, and will just cut it down if I need it in the future."
4,Watch out when you Zip Off,"These pants are quite nice. I bought them for my fiance and he liked them quite a bit (once we got the right size), but the zipper on one leg is a bit tough to work and only zips correctly when you get the teeth lined up very carefully and zip cautiously. The peat moss color is nice, since you tend to get dirty hiking and camping, and this color doesn't show the dirt like the lighter khaki color does. We've bought another pair of the Columbia pants (that have 30+ SPF) in a lighter weight fabric and are quite pleased with those as well. They wash up nicely and are quite handy for outdoor activities."
2,They could do a lot better...,"I read the reviews that said the graphics were horrible, but I didn't care as long as I had a good rugby game to play in the off-season. I bought Rugby 2004 and Madden 2004 and they arrived on the same day. Talk about a huge difference. Madden's graphics are extraordinary, the level of gameplay is extensive, nearly everything about it is top notch. Rugby, even though it is the same year-edition as Madden, is atrocious by comparison. The graphics really are terrible, the gameplay is choppy and hard to get a handle on, the sound and music sucks, and it's just not very fun to play. This game seems more like Rugby 1998 compared to other EA games. I agree with the other review that said EA probably spent most of their budget on licensing rights, and little on the game itself. Even if you love rugby, save your money. It's not worth it."
5,Wonderful Reference,"This book should be part of any botanical medicine lovers library. What a practical preventative and holistic guide to common conditions. I really like that a few herbs are thuroughly covered rather than a many herbs just touched on. The botanical issues section is awsome, it was like histroy, botany, medicine, and creativity all tossed in the mix. There are great reference charts that are easy to read and interpert. A definate must have. :-)"
3,Cheap but workable camera mount,Cheap parts but item does work. Don't expect it to last too long outside or under heave use. Would not buy again.
1,Not as shown,"Not adjustable, only received half of the parts shown in the web image.No wall mount base, only one 2"" shaft & item appeared to have been a returneditem that was reshipped."
1,Does not tighten,"If it worked, this would be perfectly adequate for $7. Unfortunately no matter how much I tighten the screw it still moves. I.e. the camera wobbles around all over the place. Now, I tested the item when I received it a few months ago. It seemed to be fine. But today when I go to install it, it is broken. Summary. If it works great, but don't expect it to last long."
4,Used it for my Foscam Cameras,My indoor foscam cameras come with a plastic mount that has only a few mounting configurations.This gizmo is made out of metal so it would do better outdoors than the plastic I think.Second with all the adapters it comes with it has many mounting configurations.
3,Camera mount,"Mounts with camera, didnt use it to much since the camera was neverready to be mounted. It would have worked for what we needed it for."
1,Swivel can't hold their own weight,Extremely disappointed in this product. This will swivel head can't even hold its own weight. Port construction and poor quality.
1,"Cheap, Beware!","This broke the first time I used it. It appears to be made of cheap pot metal and the welds are very poor quality. Mine broke where the screw stud comes out of the round base. The weld that holds that stud on there broke, so the stud just spins now. Totally useless, now, for my wall application."
1,not recommended,"amazing price, not so amazing quality. The price sounded too good to be true and it was.The ball head would not hold camera securely. Very hard to adjust in proper position, and lock in place. The mount would shift when locked, making the adjustment pointless. The ceiling clip is not correctly designed as there is no way to secure it closed except by gluing or taping it in place.Best part of it is the little 1/4-20 stud mounted on the round plate. If the ball head was better made it would have been useful."
3,"Quality is not good, but does the job","I have this mounted on my filing cabinet so I can record daily videos that I put on YouTube. It does the job, but the build quality is close to terrible."
3,It was NO NEED!,"The product I guess is good, but as suggested to buy it together, it was a waste of money, as I did not need it, since the camera itself comes with what you need for installation, either ceiling or wall!"
2,"Poor Construction, Not easy to set","This mount seemed promising until I tried to use it. The main problem is that it is very hard to get the camera attached to remain in the position you placed it in. To lock it down you have to push down hard on the swivel cap and quickly tighten the screw. Hopefully the tension will be enough to keep the camera from flopping down due to gravity. This causes another problem, as while you tighten the screw to hold the camera in place, if you tighten it a tad to much it strips the teeth on screw hole and makes the whole thing useless. You might get some use out of it if you are extremely careful with it, but don't do a lot of adjustment or you WILL strip the screw."
1,Theft prone -,"I bought this along with Loftek CXS3200 Wireless Camera. But I found that this assembly is all threaded type. You basically keep adding the different combination to get the right fit for the camera.But this threading is the weakest part as the camera itself can be unscrewed from the rod & taken away.So If you are looking for an outdoor mounting soln, this is not for you.Also I found that my CXS3200 has a 340degree view angle so the stand which came with camera is good enough.I hope I can get a refund on this..."
1,One word....JUNK!!!,"I ordered 3 of these brackets to hold my new outdoor cameras. This item is complete junk! They fell apart when hand-tightening! Also, they fail to mention that you need a hex wrench to tighten the other side of the bracket! 2 of the 3 brackets are broken! In my opinion, this is another reason why we should avoid imported junk from you-know-where!"
3,not expensive,"A 360 degree ball nut doen't tight enough to hold a possition , Foscam FI8918W is not hold on that"
1,A Cheap Piece of Junk,"I didn't expect much, but I did expect it to function. It arrived in a crushed box inside a padded envelope. Not terribly important, given that nothing inside was fragile, but still not a good sign. Then, it became apparent that the only real piece of this I wanted, the ball joint, was not functional.The thumb screw that tightens the ball joint in place is cross-threaded in the body, and cannot be completely tightened. The ball joint, therefore, is still wobbly and unstable no matter how tight you manage to get the set screw. If any weight is attached to it at all, like my iPad, it just falls over. It's a flaky design to start with, so I'm not sure it would be much better if the screw threads weren't messed up.I'd send it back for a replacement or refund, but at the price it's just not worth my time. I'll find something better locally. Save your money. This is a cheap piece of crap."
2,Make sure you really need these,I ordered many of these as suggested with Foscam cameras. Turns out the cams came with their own mounts and Amazon should not have suggested to buy these to me AND should have listed that those cameras came with mounts. These mounts are a little better than the included ones but not much and I found that 1 out of 3 screws didn't have a fully imprinted screw heads which means there was no way to screw them in through the mount in to a base and you'd have to improvise with your own screws to install the mount. In the Foscam case you can not simply use their screws with this mount because they are too small for the mount's holes.
4,Good quality,Turns out I didn't need this kit for my Foscam but I can say that it is of good quality. Seems sturdy Nd I will probably use this to install a camera outside under my eve.
1,Very poor ball head construction - no tension,"Purchsed 5 of these for an installation, only to find that the swivel ball heads wouldn't hold no matter how tight you make it. The cameras started to droop within minutes and couldn't get the tension to go back again after that. It was a one shot deal, as soon as they slipped they were no good after that. Very poor quality construction. Comes with lots of extensions and accessories though, so it seemed good from the picture."
3,"it does the job, but it came broken","the cheap ballhead didn't lock, no matter how hard the tighten the screw. I got a defective ballhead mount. Didn't want to spend the money to send it back (purchase was under $5). Luckily, I had an extra mini tripod ballhead and used it instead. I like the option to change the height of the camera mount."
2,Fail On the Ball Head Grip,"Good overall concept, but the ball head screw only partially grips, which rendered it useless for my application, which is supporting a new iPad mount with no play. They need a rock-solid ball head grip like the one on this mini tripod: http://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Tripod-Digital-Cameras-Camcorders/dp/B004OAFO0I/ref=sr_1_11"
1,Ball swivel a dud,As others have mentioned the ball swivel is a major problem. Impossible to tighten enough to hold an outdoor camera. The flimsy Foscam factory mount worked better than this thing.
2,the material is very cheap,"The main issue with this product is that the material is very cheap. Mine did not hold my camera for more than 3 hours (started to get loose). Also, there is no information about the correct way to use it or even a simple user guide. The information in the web is very poor. I returned for a complete refund. You receive what you pay."
1,"Junk, don't buy this",The locking mechanism doesn't work properly so the camera cannot be positioned and locked down. It looks like a basic design flaw. Don't waste your time trying to fix it or make it work.
1,Ball head doesn't hold IPad in place,"Just received the VideoSecu Universal Camera Mount and I have to say I'm very disappointed due to the ball head. The ball head is poorly designed and will not adequately hold my IPad in place, even after using an Allen Wrench to tighten it down. If the IPad is bumped the ball head will loosen and fail to hold the proper angle. Also, I didn't expect to have to use an Allen Wrench every time I want to take photos using the IPad on a tripod. I regret purchasing and will be returning it ASAP."
1,Useless.,"I would only get this as a last option. The mounts that come with most cameras are way better, this one is only good if you dont have any other choice."
1,Irresponsible and Unconvincing,"Although getting a book published is an admirable feat for the average Joe, I must say that such is the only thing admirable about this author's endeavor.Without really any scientific or mathematical backing, the author talks circles around some of the most groundbreaking work in the area of physics in modern times. Rather than dispute such work with logic, however, this author uses doublespeak and ""common-sense"" analogies to dissuade the reader from believing what the greatest minds on the planet have asserted using mathematics, physics, logic, and the scientific process... to dissuade the reader, often, from believing much-proven fact.Whatever the motivation, this author's irresponsible work makes for an interesting read if one wishes to see what not to do when making an argument.If one is looking for an intelligent, persuasive, or piqueing new look at theories often taken for granted, one shuold definately look elsewhere."
1,New thinking? Think again. This book is technobabble.,"This book is unfortunately worthless. Not because its viewpoint contradicts scientific knowledge of the day, but because its reasoning is so shaky and flawed. Technobabble: that is all you need as summary."
1,"A load of pre Newtonian, pre flat-earth rubbish","There are only two positive things I can think to say about this book.Firstly, good on the author for standing up for his beliefs, even if they have severely erred from the conventionalSecondly, given its dismal contents, I'm glad I only borrowed it from my local library instead of buying it"
4,A needed book from the other side.,"Excellent book. Easy reading, yet so true with interesting arguments. It can give you the first insight from dissidents against Einstein's special relativity. I'm surprised and also suspicious when first read it, but find it sound very convincing at the end. Has Hawking erred?"
3,Churchill was the right man,"I read this book , in a translation to the portuguese, here in Ceara, a state of Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.In eleven chapters, this book has Churchill, as the subject. Mainly the Churchill during the World War II.This book isn't long or false, but this book is biased.In 1940, Churchill was a very weak military leader.In fact, Hitler had less and low quality tanks than Churchill and France in 1940.Even so, Hitler win clearly, in 1940.That dictator took France, without no problems.The Churchill's failures in Asia, aren't also covered correctly in this book.Even being another Churchill's fan, even recognizing that he was the right man, I must tell you that this book has only regular quality about this subject."
4,Great Read,This book was an easy read and very entertaining. I am looking forward to the author's next book.
3,Good info spoiled by too many errors,"This would have been a really good book if it hadn't had so many errors. Some were not too difficult to figure out, but not being a really experienced VB programmer, there were some examples that I just couldn't get to work and never did figure out why. It's too bad because otherwise it seems like a pretty good book, giving good information on the new features in VB6 but without assuming much prior knowledge of databases."
1,Good information but terrible examples,"This book has some good information but assumes the reader knows what the author wants him/her to do. After about the third chapter I was lost, and I am majoring in Information Systems. After about chapter 10 I wanted to burn the book. It has no good examples to step you through the coding."
2,Fire the Editor,"The concept of this book is good and the writing is clear. However, it seems to have been published without any editing. There are numerous errors that should have been caught by an editor, or by someone trying the sample programs. To make the code in the hour by hour lessons work requires prior expertise in VB programming. Not a good book for beginners."
3,A good book if you're new to VB6,"I'd recommend this book if you're familiar with database programming on VB5, but want to get up to speed on the new features of VB6. I think the lack of depth will leave beginners disappointed, though.Focuses on ADO & the Data Environment, with only minimal coverage of DAO/RDO and working with the database through code."
1,"If You Have Half A Brain, Don't Buy This Book","Even with my very limited background in client side web scripting and Flash ActionScript, I thought this book was slow and stupid. Its coverage of VB is very superficial. I don't see why they produce books like this. If you have to read a book this dumb then you will probably never be able to write a usueful program in VB of any kind because you're not smart enough to write code.If you have no idea about programing I suggest starting by learning JavaScript."
4,Ideal VB intro for Java and C/C++ programmers,"I think this book is very good for those people who have some experience of programming in other languages (i can say so for java or C/C++ programmers at least). Book is quick I mean you can learn a lot in very short time (say thanks to your experience in other languages). Book is well compiled but examples could be made more interesting. Some buggy codes in there too, so keep your MSDN CD handy. People who are new to programming should consider other titles like Mastering Visual Basic 6. I must say in this price its no harm to add this book to your collection if you don't already have any VB book."
2,"Nice outline, but numerous mistakes","Overall, the book has a nice step by step outline that helps guide the novice vb programer through database programing. But, with the numerous mistakes, I spent more time trying to figure out what the author really meant to write then the time I spent on learning the material."
1,The Unforgiveable Sin,"The author has committed the unforgiveable sin of using buggy code samples. Shame on Sam's publishing for not revising the text. Keep looking, this isn't the book you want - especially if you're a beginner."
1,Beware!,"A money waste! Why? 1. you can NOT learn how to program databases in 24 hours, no matter how much of a VB wiz you are. 2. This book is poorly written. 3. The examples are misleading and infested with bugs. If that's not enough, then I guess this book is for you. :)"
2,Poor Quality,"I was soo excited about these pens, as soon as I received them I shared them around. But boy, talk about poor quality. I was hoping to see the shimmer in the ink as I did with some bic pens in the past, I was also expecting a nice smell from them. But instead, some pens were not writing and those that did, life span was too short."
2,"Alright, but not really glittery","These write just like any other regular BIC pen, just okay. The colors are vibrant and pretty, but are not at all glittery in my opinion."
4,Great colors,"Love these pens, love the colors! Great for drawing, or note taking. Pens will dry out after a year, but thats to be expected with pens!"
5,Bic Shimmers Ball Pens,"Smooth writing pens in a variety of colors. These are my favorites to use when I write notes, checks, or journal."
3,there are better tools out there,"This tool kit does the job i suppose. But beware, the base does not accommodate all bracelet sizes. My citizen eco-drive watch was such a tight fit, it left scuff marks on the bracelet.One of the .08 pin snapped already after 3 uses. Finding the right angle and amount of pressure gets tricky when you cant fasten the bracelet securely to the base. I would venture to guess the pin removal tool with the turn knob is a better buy regarding this issue, as well as replacement of bracelet pin."
2,Pin removal spring bar tool set,"Poor quality, thicker watch bands won't fit and the push pins break very easy due to the fact that perhaps they were hardened too much !!"
4,Just right for my needs,"This is a small cabasa, but it has a good sound and is just what I needed. I'm gradually adding percussion to songs performed by the small chorus in my senior community. I'm working it in gradually!"
2,Another group with limited talent - no originality,A lot of promotion hype. Very mediocre. Saw in concert as a warm up...not impressed. Puffy trying hard to sell this group.
5,Dream=Album of the Year,"This CD will be close to impossible to top! From track 1 to track 17, its off the hook. Ashley,Melissa,Diana, and Holly have the most amazing voices I've heard in a long time. If you don't buy this CD then you are missing out on what will definitly be nominated for Best New Comers at every music award show this year. Best songs on the album are ""When I Get There"" and ""How Long"" but not one song lacks the ability to become a single."
1,Dream of Genie!!!,"All of these girls sound like Christina Aguilera! I'll give them a shout out for there song ""He Loves You Not""!!"
5,Dream's Awesome CD,"Dream is definately a great band! The CD ""It Was All A Dream"" rocked my stereo! Excellent sound, great songs, who could ask for more? All I ask is that they make another, even awesomer CD for me to listen to!"
3,It's alright....,"This CD is alright...it doesn't completely suck, but it's not like ""wow!"", either. I really like the songs he loves u not, in my dreams, this is me, i don't like anyone, miss you, our prayer, how long, and the remix of he loves u not. I know mr. telephone man sounds cheesy when you first listen to it, but somehow, it's grown on me!=0) I think what would make this album completely wonderful is if they didn't put all those interludes and other filler tracks. Altogether there are seventeen tracks on the whole CD. And only nine of them are good in my opinion. The rest of the tracks all sound like I'm listening to one huge song. They don't really stand out at all. Hope this helps you out!=0)"
5,Dream's It Was All a Dream,Dream's It Was All a Dream is the best cd ever! It rocks! These girls have so much talent and the world is fortunate that p diddy discovered them. The vocals and girl power lyrics on this cd are amazing. Don't let there short career fool you cuz they will be around for sooo much longer. They are the best girl pop group around. There is no one else like them.
2,Disapointing...,"We all know ""He loves you not,"" and it's a good song, but not great. And the rest on this album is just filler."
2,Unfortunate,"When their first Single ""He loves u not"" came out, I loved it and thought for sure their album would be amazing. I bought it and was shocked, amazed and finally too bored to go on. I was shocked when I heard the cheesy and corny interludes they had, something like a Britney Spears rip off. I was amazed that ever other song on their album sounded exactly alike. They had one good song, and then they tried to make a whole album based off of that.Don't buy this, see if you can just buy that one single."
4,"delicious pop music, but obviously short-lived","all of their songs are very catchy, the girls have talent; But the only worthy song is not He loves U not, but When I get there. because this is the ONLY song that is not complete girly fluff crap. But Dream is obviously short-lived, because after a while it gets old and all the girly fluff thing really gets you. ironically though, they do represent those girls who have nothing to do but talk about boys all day. this is like THE perfect example."
5,FUN POP MUSIC!,"I won't try to make ""It Was All a Dream"" out to be some deep musical experience - it's pure, fun pop - but I love it!I only have two problems with the CD, and both are ""P. Diddy"" related!1. The ""He Loves You Not"" remix is TERRIBLE! It's basically the single with a harder beat and annoying words from P. Diddy breaking into the singing. Ugh.2. The interludes. They're pointless! They work well on rap CDs (sometimes), but there's really no point on a pop CD. The songs are self-explanatory already!But, enough complaints! I LOVE THIS CD!Standout Tracks: ""He Loves You Not,"" ""I Don't Like Anyone,"" and ""When I Get There."""
4,buy it!,This is a great cd for anyone who likes pop music. The songs are catchy and make you want to dance. There is only 1 ballad on this cd and it is beautiful. The girls have amazing voices considering their youth. With 17 tracks you definitely get your money's worth with this cd. Buy It!
2,More of a nightmare,"The first hit single, ""He Loves U Not"" was great but unfortuneatly the Dream girls couldn't produce anymore hits like that. ""This is Me"" is also a pretty good song. The rest of he album however is repetitive and bubble gum pop. The rest of the stongs lack originality and steady beats. There are a lot of random interludes where the the girls are just talking boy crazy with no sense. One of the worst songs is ""Mr. Telephone Man"". The song is senseless talking about a hung up phone call. Most of the songs are like that with senseless lyrics and random tunes. These one-hit wonders need to produce more than just a single on a 17 track album. Try again P. Diddy"
4,OK,If you are looking for inbetween a Briteny and Christina I think this will be your best pick. Songs like HE LOVES YOU NOT and THIS IS ME are awesome. So check the c.d. out.
3,okay?but worth buying,this cd is okay its not that good if you loved the song heloves u not your in for a real suprise the songs are tottally different than he love u not its has like a couple good dancing songs but it is still worth getting if you like them because if you would get imports they would cost all most triple the cost hope you think my advice was usefull peace :) *mikey*
5,Am I dreaming?,"Okay, I MUST be dreaming. This album is AWESOME. Except for a rather corny intro, and some (in my opinion) boring interludes, this album is great. There's only ONE song that I don't like, and that is ANGEL INSIDE. I'm just not feelin' that track. The beginning of that song is sooooo boring I just skip that song. But that is the only song on that whole album that I skip, so yeah, that says a lot. All of the other tracks are awesome, and my favorites include In My Dreams, This Is Me, and When I Get There, although those are just 3 of the awesome tracks. I would strongly recommend getting this album."
4,Buy this cd!,"This is an awesome cd! If you're a pop fan and love good music you can dance to, this is a must have. The girls have great voices and it's so fun to listen to and to relate to! Buy this!"
5,I found this album enjoyable.,"This was such a great CD. I don't know what happened to them. For those who don't remember Dream were the first all female white pop group on P. Diddy's Bad Boy Records. They hit it big too. Their first single, ""He Loves You Not,"" was a big hit on TRL and the girls became MTV staples but to date this was their only album. The album had some great songs and the girls even remade the New Edition hit ""Mr. Telephone Man."" I found this album enjoyable."
4,They got a look and songs too!!,"This new girl pop group that Puff had discovered with their new hit single ""he loves me not"" is a pretty big success. In their songs, I can tell that Puff had add some R&B style to it,so it's more than just few pop songs. In this album they have some pretty good dance songs with some slow songs to show that they can sing too. It surprised me that with all these problemssurrounding Puff, but he still got time to try to get back on his feet with this new girl group. I have to say although this isn't the best pop album, but it's worth to listen to."
4,Neat Sound from Hot Girls,"Everyone has heard their first single, ""He Loves You Not"", and has loved it. Well, now it is time for you to fall head over heels with this new cd. This CD is an awesome compilation of pop and r&b. This Cd is a must have for any pop fan. I like all the songs. Get this CD."
4,Sick of Girlgroups?,"Hmmm, when I first heard he loves you not, I thought it was a little too much ""Hi we are gonna make this a big hit"". But later I really liked the hook and so I decided to get the cd - and it is such a positive surprise! It is not as girl-poppy as expected, but more rnb-like especially ""in my dreams"" and ""angel inside"". although they are younger they sound much more mature than, let's say britney?"
4,New pop at its best,"While the music IS pop, with producer Puffy, the music becomes edgier, with a more hip-hop flavor. This suits the CD and its singers, injecting Dream with lots of catchy beats and tunes (something Bad Boy is known for). Although the skits between songs are somewhat annoying, this CD is easy to sit down and listen to (or get up and dance to!)"
2,Let's Try A little harder,"Ok P Diddy and the Family might have hit big with this pop group straight out of the junior high but their success has no future. Listening to this album reminds me of just how successful B*withced became.... One hit white girl wonders... But I likely will not wonder. With songs like ""What we gon' Do About Us"" it is obvious these girls should finish grammar school before pursuing their musical careers. I am glad to see Bad Boy wanted to find some good girls and try to make them bad... at English that is."
5,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...,"""Staring at the ceiling thinkin' 'bout..."" DREAM!! This totally hip-hop infused pop has me boppin' and singin' along, and I love it! The interludes add a perfect touch to these rockin' songs with fabulous vocals and real, genuine character. Dream has edge, attitude, sweetness, and the makings of a hit. 2001 is ALL about DREAM, BABY! Good luck to Diana, Ashley, Holly, and Melissa! Shouts to the Dream Team =) <3 LiZ"
4,"if i was a teen, i'd be Dreaming too!","I'm 24, and I'm perfectly surprised with the level of maturity this album presents. This is probably the best teen group album I've heard in years! The music is unmissable, despite the lead vocalist's lack of 'umph' in the songs when needed. Noticeable tracks: He Loves U Not, When I Get There, Mr. Telephone (""...there's something wrong with my line...""), Miss You and best of all tracks, Do You Wanna Dance. I have only one dislike in the album, which is there's the same lead singer in all tracks."
2,don't waste your money,"Don't get me wrong...i LOVE the whole teenie-bopper pop scene. With goups like N*Sync how could you not. I got this album because i love ""He Loves You Not"" and I just figured that all of the songs would be good....but I was wrong. The girls have good voices but the songs suck! The only good songs on it are ""He Loves You Not,"" ""He Loves You Not (Bad Boy Remix),"" and ""In My Dreams."" So don't waste your money. If you don't believe me, go dowload some of the songs and see for yourself. If you want to get a good CD get J.Lo or O Town. I'm very disappointed in Puffy...I thought for sure he'd of done better."
3,"Okay, But I Expected More","Since these girls are under the Bad Boy label and are managed by Sean ""P Diddy"" Combs, I expected more from this quartet. While some of the songs are rather catchy, like Dream's cover of New Edition's ""Mr. Telephone Man,"" many are corny and too much like the teen pop that people have been sick of for so long. I won't say that the entire CD is bad, because it's not, but I can't say that I was totally enthralled by it either. Once the girls find their niche in the music industry and their own sound, I'm sure they'll do well."
1,Terrible,"This cd is extemely boring for the average girl older than 9. I am 14 and this is quite possibly the worst cd i have ever heard. The lyrics are VERY babyish and the target audience for this cd if 8 year olds. These singers are older than me but sing for 8 year olds. This cd is overall, extremely disapointing."
1,How old are they?,"this group of girls have underdeveloped voices, and i feel are not adequate singers. maybe if they waited a few years they wouldnt have gone out as ""One Hit"" wonders. after their 2nd single did we see them again? No, because the quality of this cd is very poor. Dont waste your time or money buying this cd"
2,This is so generic...,"Why must me we pelted with teen band crap? These songs have no progression! It's just the same repetitive choruses, typical dance beats, and sappy ballads. VARY THINGS UP DAMNIT! I have no idea why people who just might have some singing talent go to such lengths to make their music so typical. If these girls threw in lots more harmonies, longer songs (can any pop band write a song above 4:30?) and less repetition it will be much better."
1,NOT GOOD,"WOW, P DIDDY PLEASE STOP THE MADNESS. WHO Told these women that they had talent. P.DIDDY I SUPPOSE......WHO himself has NO I MEAN NO TALENT AT all. DREAM KEEP DREAMING....ITS NOT HAPPENING.Greg Lassiterwww.misguidedproduction.com"
1,TRASH,"Dream is just another pop group that doesn't play their own instruments, doesn't write their own songs and can't sing. They are just another Britney Spears and 'N SYNC ext. group my advice do not waste your money on this CD."
5,Pop at it's best...,"I definately consider this a ""Must-have"" album. Commercially speaking, ""P-Diddy"" (the artist formerly known as Puff Daddy) did an excellent production job. Almost every one of the songs is a potential top-ten hit. The album is a great blend of pop with a slight R&B edge. Whenever I listen to ""It was All a Dream"" I feel energized. These girls have great voices too! The melodies of the songs are catchy and there are a variety of songs on the album. There are a lot of dance numbers and some great ballads. If you like Pop or R&B, you will most likely love this album; just like I do!"
3,It's just ok..,"When I first got this album I didn't really enjoy it, but as I got listening to it I got to like it a little bit more, their not the best girl group ever but their not the worst ethier. Some of them have stronger vocal cords then the others and I find they should of let Ashley be in alot more of the lead vocals because she does have the best voice. They are still very young and their voices will grow as they produce more albums, but I believe they made it this far only because of Puff Daddy. I found the Interludes ruineded alot of the album and they should of focussed more on the music instead."
1,dream on to another artist,"this is an extremely unoriginal group. the quality of the songs such as their debut ""he loves u not"" is not very good. i have nothing more to add."
3,Cool CD,"Dream -- ""It Was All A Dream""CD was released in 2001Songs:1. It Was All A Dream (Intro)2. He Loves U Not3. In My Dreams4. This Is Me5. I Don't Like Anyone6. Reality (Interlude)7. Pain8. When I Get There9. What We Gonna Do About Us10. Jordan (Interlude)11. Mr. Telephone Man12. Angel Inside13. Do You Wanna Dance14. Miss You15. Our Prayer (Interlude)16. How Long17. He Loves U Not (Remix)"
3,Dissapionted,"I got this CD after I heard the awesome song, ""He loves me he loves you not"". I was so mad to hear sissy, wishy washy songs and the interludes are SO lame! I think this is less than bubble gum pop! This is like, kindergarden music. If you like sweet, dumb, pop get it, if not do NOT!"
2,Nice girls with good intentions but....,They can't sing to me. So far there's about 3 or 4 of these new hot groups that really can't sing. I'm on to Eden's Crush. At least I know they can actually sing from watching their special. Nice idea to get this groups going but please let at least 2 of them know how to sing or at least know how to harmonize together. This is too bad.
2,People like this stuff?,"Wow,this cd is pretty bad.I bought it for my girl,because shes into this kind of music.And i was listening to it with her and was thinking to myself how can anyone like this stuff.I was grinding my teeth as each track played and wanted to get the hell out the room.After about halfway through the cd i couldnt take it anymore and told her to please turn it off.This isnt as bad as some of that other teen pop garbage.the track ""he loves you not"" has a catchy beat to it and i was kinda embarassed when i caught myself bobbing my head to it.And the girls are cute(theyre young,but,cute)and i can tell that they have some talent, but if they keep making songs like the ones on this album they wont be around long enough to fully achive the little pontential they have to be a serious music group."
5,A Great CD,Let me tell you about why this album is so great...because first of all these girls can sing second i like because there a bunch of white girls singing r&b and you dont see that to often...thats cool cause it goes to show there is no color line in music. There also just a group of 4 talented girls that puffy made there dreams come true and doing what they love to do.
2,Not too crazy about it...,"I would recommend spending a little extra and get the Iwata High performance C (HB-C), now that is will worth the expense!"
1,Not what I ordered/expected,"The Pilot Drill bit that came in the mail is nothing like what I ordered. I received a black oxide, extra long Pilot Drill Bit. Not polished steel with indentations for where it seats in the chuck like shown/stated in the picture. I can buy the same drill bit that I received at Home Depot for $3 and I do not have to wait over 3 weeks for the item. What a rip off. This is the second time that I have ordered something from an Amazon outside vender and received a totally different Item. I have never had an issue when dealing with Amazon Directly, only when dealing with certain outside vendors that sell through Amazon. If this happens one more time then that's 3 strikes and I am out. It is not worth my time over a $6 item to return it and wait 3 weeks for another one. I guess I will write it off as a bad experience. The pilot drill bit is not worth the $6 it cost me."
2,Cropped on all sides.,"Love the movie, however the video plays as a tiny rectangle in the middle of your screen, not an error on my end, it's just cropped that way."
3,I was very disapointed,I didn't like this movie. It is equivalent to the 'B' movies from the 50s and 60s.
3,Space Truckers,"I had no desire to see this movie when it hit the screens but should have. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. While the plot is not a good as it could have been it is pretty decent entertainment. Really great graphics and set layout. Of course, Dennis Hopper is always great on screen. And what about those square pigs? LoL! If you are a fan of Dennis I recommend you check out 'My Science Project' and 'Riders of the Storm' as these are some of his lesser known films which are fun to watch."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"In the quest for bad Sci-Fi's, we found this. By far, hands down this is the worst movie you could possibly see. If they had negative star ratings, this movie would qualify. I'd rather watch my arm being severed off by a butter knife. I just can't wait for the sequel...it's sure to be sooooo much better."
4,"This is a fun movie says me, a harsh critic","Hey the reviews below are irrelevent. I should know. I say a lot of the same thing about most movies I was in this genre, but his movie is effective if you don't automatically assume that it is silly. In fact, I found the robot killing machine quite creepy and the light humor purposeful. It is not supposed to be an all out serious movie so don't expect one. Ahhh, what am I saying. What do you care anyway?"
3,A Diabolical Dire Piece of Dung: BUT the girl is STUNNING !!,"I thought to myself, "" `Space Truckers;' that sounds a bit different, I think I'll watch that."" A minute into the movie, it dawned on me that this was no ordinary movie; it started to emerge that it was going to be a diabolical dire piece of dung.Then, just as I was going to put the movie out of its misery, the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life appeared in it - Debi Mazar. I found myself watching the movie a few more times, to say the least..."
4,A very kinky movie,I saw this on HBO. It's been reviewed so many times that I really don't know what I can add. I guess I agree with the other reviewers in essence. I was particularly grossed out at the image of cute little Debi Mazar having sex with the genetically remanufactured space pirate with the pull-start crotch engine. Thank God that didn't happen.
3,pretty good,"Satrship troopers it's not but a nice and an enjoyable movie. effects are good but under no circumstances would I buy this video at that price but still when the price lowers closer to normal, if you like space movies this is worth looking."
4,"Main Stars are Dennis Hopper, Stephen Dorff, Charles Dance, Debbi Mazar","It makes me crazy to see the stars listed for a movie or TV series are NOT the main characters. Amazon, apparently, has copied the actor list from www.imdb.com and so the main characters, who appear further on down the list, do not even appear after the title of the movie. A potential buyer of this DVD would be looking for the main characters not the bit players.I have tried to move up the stars in a DVD's list of actors before but have been rejected. Sometimes, but not always, someone actually looks at what I am trying to do and fixes the problem. Example: On Tour of Duty, a female actress was in a few episodes of ONE season but she was the only name Amazon put for all 3 seasons instead of Terrence Knox, et al. Doesn't make sense. It was finally fixed.By the way, I really like this movie and would recommend it to those who like sci-fi action movies with good actors (characters!)."
4,Bad Discs Permanent Storyboards!,"We think this movie is a great sci-fi spoof & bought it on DVD over a year ago -- the disc we were shipped froze constantly & we had difficulty with the set up options, so returned it. We've bought it again more than a year later thinking they'd surely corrected this problem, but no -- still screen jamming requiring shutoff of DVD player & worst of all -- permanent storyboards! Anybody figured out how to actually turn the storyboards off?"
3,OK film,"Space Truckers is a lot of fun to watch, but it is very dumb. Maybe that is part of its charm. This movie is fun to watch and is very funny in spots. Most of the reviewers of this film are correct in giving Space Truckers 3 stars."
4,A Hilarious Little Classic,"I stumbled across this film on VHS in the used bin of a Blockbuster. I thought, Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance, why not? Truckers in space, why not?Why not? Indeed. This hilarious little gem is full of pleasant surprises. Yes, it sorta runs out of steam by the end, but who cares?It's a classic direct to video film, low budget, but it makes the most of what it has. I could describe the plot, but hey, just like ""Snakes on a Plane"": ""Space Truckers"", what else do you need to know?It's rare to get something with this sense of humour in outer space."
2,"Too campy, too lame, too boring, and two stars","Hopper, Dorrif, ""Norm"" hey, they are all great actors, but they must have been paying off bills when doing this film. The first five minutes of this film are the only five minutes worth watching, it builds suspense but doesnt deliver. The sets are corny, the costumes are lame, and the writing subpar. The only other thing remotely interesting is the filmakers view of trucking lines in the future, with all of the flashy neon signs and advertisements, it will probably be very acurate when we eventually get interstellar highways."
4,Equal to Tank Girl,"This is another cult classic. The cast agrees. A combination swashbuckler,space pirate, trucker love story."
1,Very Poor Effort For Great Cast,"I thought the cast alone would make this one worth seeing, but I was wrong. Predictable cliché plot with huge holes. Even the special effects were pretty poor, especially in the first scene. This has to rank as one of the biggest disappointments I've had in awhile. Is there a ranking of less than 1 star?"
2,Great Visuals - Bad Story Line,"I found that this movie had good special effects that were engaging to watch, but the story line was choppy at best. The story line seemed very disjointed. I would get up to do something and come back to find that the three main characters were in a different plot twist than when I got up! The plot was several mini adventures that were just thrown together. I would get up during the overheating in the cabin to fighting space pirates....then get up and come back to them fighting killer robots. I will say that I like the pirate captain, but the concept of his character isn't enough for me to pay nearly ... for this movie!"
4,"Nice earrings, but didn't like backings.","These are nice earrings in their design and size, but the backs were difficult to remove."
4,Pretty earrings,"Purchased these as a Christmas gift for a daughter-in-law who loves hummingbirds. I like the three colors, and although they are a bit smaller than I expected, they are very pretty. They arrived promptly, and I'm sure she will like her gift."
4,bough as a gift,"Bought as a gift. They look nice. Personally, I wouldn't wear them but I have a grandmother who loved hummingbirds and these are right up her alley."
4,solid good times music,"this is really a delightful album. if you like hammond organs, you'll love this. it's not just some dumb rehash of a bunch of standards, but rather a very interesting approach to some tremendously interesting tunes. highly recommended."
4,5 stars for Buddy ..miss a star for ...,"I could not help noticing that on disc 2 Track 8 is not the 'Peggy Sue Got Married',that i'm used to; nor track 9- Crying Waiting Hoping,nor Track 11 'Learning The Game' , and finally Track 12 'What To Do' .. the backing tracks must have come from somewhere else..sad really , as the sound and mastering is the best i've heard on Buddy yet .I have burned my own copy without these tracks , and i'm trading this in .It is a Dutch release ..so someone in Holland screwed up .Had to drop a star for this mess up; Where these tracks were dubbed i do not know .buyer and Holly fans beware .Track selection is what drew me to this release on paper; a great compilation ...the search continues for compilations featuring ALL original tracks ."
3,Begonias,"Beautiful book for tuberous begonia growers. Unfortunately, I did not realize that it was focused on mainly tuberous begonias when I ordered it, I would have preferred to have had more information about angel wing and other types of begonias."
1,unconciously limited perspective,"If you deal with gold every day, you may eventually think gold is the most important matter in the world: not because that is a truth, but because you are 'unconciously limited' to that topic. Mr. Smith is a precious metal and coin dealer, that makes him think that way."
5,At Long Last!,"All of the books I have ever read about Darwin either extoll him a a perfect, God-like creature, or vilify him as a demon. This book provides a comprehensive view of Darwin as he was, that is, as he saw himself and as others saw him. I was surprised to read that Darwin had many predecessors in the development of his theory, and that the flaws of the theory (which are significant) were generally recognized long before the challenges of modern science pointed them out. If you want your fancies about Darwin tickled, read others. If you want the facts, read Himmelfarb. I strongly recommend this book."
5,A Great Gift,This is a great gift for yourself or someone you love. My daugter gave it to me & I bought one for several of my girlfriends.
4,very well done,I read this daily and have bought it for presents for several family members and friends.
4,Why are you overworked?,"This little day-to-day book may help explain to us why as women we often make life choices that leave us over-worked and feeling bitter and unfulfilled. Using a combination of quotes, questions, and tough-love talk, Anne Wilson Schaef's book sheds some 12-step spiritual-style and common-sense light into the dark corners of the busy-rushaholics- work-aholics life. Give this book to a woman you love or admire who ""does too much"" and then buy a copy for yourself."
5,Make this book a habit!,I've been reading this book daily for 15 years; have purchased several recently and passed them on to younger women. Good way to start each day.
3,Worth a few bucks,I found the book not as full of wisdom as the first edition but was glad to see some of the old material. I expected it to be better and it wasn't
4,Great gift for any woman,I have given a copy of this book to every woman I've ever worked with. I stumbled upon it in my OB's office because there was an excerpt framed on the wall that really spoke to me when I was feeling the pressure of being a working new mom. It's got great daily 1-page accounts of how to put things in perspective and reduce the pressure we put on ourselves.
3,Meditations for Women Who Do Too Much,I liked the earlier version better. This one seems to have a somewhat harsh 'edge' to the meditations. It's good - but not as good as the last version from my perspective.
4,Read this every night,"I'm a new mom, a PhD student, a full-time worker (though I work from home 3 days a week), and the primary caretaker of our home. I try to read this at least once a day and have found it's really helped with keeping things in perspective. Worth the investment - both time to read and money to purchase the book!"
5,great book,i would recommend it to anyone .....it help me everyday to simply read this ......my mom is getting it next
3,A Great Way to Get Connected to the Spirit,"Ms. Weir's book is very interesting and informative. The knowledge she gained from communicating with Jerry's oversoul is very powerful for us as humans in this day. Weir explores the importance of love and compassion for us as humans to practice, feel, and share. I think it is a great book to read because it explains important, yet sometimes complex concepts."
1,Indulgent indulgent indulgent,"A good question to ask while reading this book would be: So what? After all, my five-year-old nephew also has an invisible friend. It's good to grieve and let your imagination go to places both dark and light, however, we must be careful not to fall too much in love with our own reflections to the point where we arrogantly publish it as fact. Thank you for sharing. By the way, I collect stamps!"
5,Inspiring and From the Heart,"I found this book to be not only inspiring, but also a true lesson from writer to reader. Even if the reader didn't know of Jerry Garcia, you will go away with important life lessons. This book has not only helped myself, but many friends too. If you have ever lost a loved one to spirit, this book not only comforts, but gives hope in life beyond this worldly plane. It took Miss Weir alot of courage to put this book in the hands of the public, and for that I applaud her. She has helped a countless number of people, and has inspired me to further my knowledge about spirit. Thank you Wendy!"
2,Estimated Prophet?,"First off, I think the author is sincere, and had some genuine experiences but got carried away with the glamor of her subject and pushed it into an unintentional parody of everything that's new age and deadhead. As a ""new age deadhead"" I was sympathetic with the book at first, but her self-seriousness, the kitschy drawings and prose, and the deification of Garcia just about did me in. My guess is Jerry would have hated it. I wonder what Bob really thinks... At the end of the book, she solicits readers' spiritual experiences, dreams, etc. with Jerry and other band members. It sounds like she is planning a sequel and is heading for a career as the spiritual teacher for Jerry-worshipping deadheads. This is the kind of stuff her brother sang about in ""Estimated Prophet."""
1,So Who's Gonna Channel Pigpen?,"The one thing that Jerry Garcia hated the most was the tendency of some of his fans to elevate him into some kind of guru. With the publication of Ms. Weir's book Ol' Jer's ashes must be spinning in the Ganges.This book has nothing to do with the life of Jerry Garcia. It's about Wendy Weir, whose life as a hard-core newager/occultist/whatever isn't anywhere near as interesting."
4,"Cool music, great DVD!!!","I am not a big fan of Canadian music to be honest, so I wanted to give it a try... The music CD of the 2004 Junos is kinda cool with great songs by Michael Buble and Shania Twain. But the true reward is the DVD included within... It is the performances of the 2003 Junos hosted by Shania Twain. But the only regret, is that they should've put the awards too (it's only the songs)"
4,"Jazzy, Yet Eclectic","Walking into an underground record store in the East Village (NYC) and hearing ""The Big Dipper"" on Fila Brazillia's Black Market Gardening CD, instantly made me a fan of their music. While I don't consider Fila Brazillia's music to be limited to Acid Jazz, all of the tracks on this CD have a jazzy, yet eclectic sound that is almost indescribable. ""The Big Dipper"" has got to be one of the best Acid Jazz tracks that I have ever heard. I purchased the Black Market Gardening CD in 1997 - a time when Fila Brazillia wasn't as ""mainstream"", since then, I have bought a few more of their CDs, but in my opinion this CD is one of their best works."
2,ugly washed out color,This comforter is not the rich chocolate shown in the picture and is much mor ea washed out looking brown. Only redeeeming factor is it's a comfortable product but of course I can't put it anywhere guests might see it given the ugly color.
4,Feather Comforter,As some have said it is a little noisy but so nice and cozy I am not awake to long to bother me.
2,Warm but noisy...,"The comforter looks attractive from afar in the bedroom, but it is NOISY - yes NOISY....There is a distinct crinkle/ crunch noise when you sit on the comforter, and make the bed. The fabric is also a bit shiny for my linking. Our primary purpose though was met, it is WARM especially with flannel sheets. I don't know that we'll use it year round though."
1,DO NOT BUY OR YOU WILL REGRET IT,"Anyone who gave this rating more then one star is crazy. The only thing I like is the color so that is why it gets one star.I was really excited to order the comforter. Everyone gave it good reviews and said how nice and soft it was. When we received it we knew from reviews that it would be flat but after letting it set for awhile that the feathers would expand and that hasn't happened yet. The fabric is so rough. It feels like paper. We have washed it hoping that it would help and it didn't. It is still so uncomfortable. It also doesn't fit like a queen comforter should. I read about this in another review and wish I would have listened.This was a complete waste of money. I plan on replacing it with something else, but until then I am going to just use it for decoration on my bed until I go to sleep then it get thrown to the floor because thats where it belongs."
1,Do not buy,Read reviews before I bought this item and they were on point. Item had bad smell to it. Very uncomfortable and makes alot of noise. Color was nice would only use for decorative purposes. Did not like.
3,thin but warm king size too small,The title of this review basically says it all. The comforter is warmer than you'd expect for something so thin. And the king size stretches from edge to edge of my king size bed with little to no room to hang over the sizes.I wouldn't buy it again but I also won't toss it in the trash.
1,CHEAP!!!!,"I would hope that no one buys this blanket. I regret it!! It was a gift for x mas but it was so thin and rough feeling, that I ended up putting in the closet. I wouldnt give it as a gift because I would be embarrassed. I doubt if I will even use it. Maybe I will give it to GoodWill!!"
2,It does smell,It does smell and is mostly feathers. I guess you get what you pay for. I worry that the item is sterile?
4,The best thing...,The best thing about this comforter besides price is that it's grid stitching. It keeps the feathers from collecting in just one place and absolutely makes it easier when you wash it.
4,"nice comfortor, great value","The comfortor is very fluffy and comfortable, but a little stiff. Since it is 95% feather and only 5% down it is not as soft as others. But the price is right and you get used to the quality."
2,WOW ?,"After reading the (glowing) reviews for this book, I purchased a copy. I would say that this book is pretty weak. He presents a lot of shallow arguments, but doesn't go into the details that one would expect. His coverage of the Internet protocols is not at all in depth. I had hoped to get a more detailed analysis of the protocols of the Internet. I also find his presentation for describing the ""Abstract Protocol"" language as vague and confusing, and the syntax is needlessly convoluted. Why does he need to use a 'box' symbol to separate different actions? Perhaps another symbol which actually appears on most keyboards would have been a better choice."
4,HDMI Cable,HDMI cable shipped as promised. This being a standard HDMI cable - except a bit longer than most - it works fine.
4,"""Fighting Frank"" Carvell: Partisan and Patriot","A must for anyone interested in 20th century Canadian History! Lucidly written it details the political career of Frank Broadstreet Carvell, a country lawyer from Woodstock, New Brunswick who led the Liberal hunt for Tory scandals from 1911 -1917. He uncovered the Southampton Railway Scandal, formulated bribery charges against J. Kidd Flemming (NB's popular premier) and prosecuted him out of office and then accused the federal Government of Robert Borden of patronage in handing out shell contracts during the early years of the Great War.By 1917, this caustic partisan critic had risen to the second most powerful Liberal in Canada and was destined to succeed Sir Wilfred Laurier when he parted with his leader over the issue of conscription, thereby sacrificing his political career by voting in favor of the Military Service Act.A very good story told in the backdrop of Federal and Provincial politics during the Great War."
2,i hate george mair!,"i love bette midler so much, and was so looking forward to reading an awesome bio of her. but ol' george had to go screw that all up! he's a dreadful writer - this book sounded like a 3rd grader's report on abe lincoln.i can't imagine his bios on rosie or oprah being much better."
5,"Bette Midler is someone Special,George Mair showed that.","As i Said before,Bette Midler is a special person,and the way George Mair showed this was a Unique (?)and Interesting way. It was Easy to follow,and was not hard to read,even I , A 12 Year old can read it,though it is Well Expressed and use's Discriptive words.I enjoyed this book,and for all those Bette Followers out there, you will too."
3,What kind of book is this?,"I am a HUGE fan of Bette, but some of the things Mr. Mair put in here, makes it sound trashy, and dirty. If you are going to write a biography, about someone like Bette Midler, the good things would be first on the list. Ok, the thing with Geraldo Riveara, or however you spell it, it happened. You don't need to tell every detail! And the massuer thing, it happened too, but the details! Hey, this is just my opinion, but if I were Bette, and I had a choice, I would'nt want my personal, and I mean PERSONAL things in there, like the masseur thing. I would be embarassed if my friends read that. No offence to Bette, because I am a big fan and would never mean that as an insult."
5,"Fascinating History, Excellent Info","Murder In Jackson HoleWhile I was researching the fourth in my Jackson Hole Mysteries series, which is about horse stealing in the 19th century and present-day quarter horse racing, I needed a back story. I decided to give a main character a family history that went back to the early King ranch and was lucky enough to find this book. It proved to be perfect for my designs but, more than that, gave me some very enjoyable hours reading it for its merits as both a history and a rousing tale of a man who got off a boat broke and built an empire. Buy it."
4,Great Cast,"Cast is amazing: Karl Malden, Eva Marie Saint, Warren Beatty, Angela Lansbury and handsome looking Brandon De Wilde (who died sadly very young at a car accident).I can't say lot things because the most reviewers wrote about or read please the wikipeadia entry.The DVD release:Its a shame that the movie don't get a better official really than just on DVD-R and not restored/remastered.I'm always dissapointed not to have any english subtitles on those Warner Brothers Archive Collection-Release.PICTURE QUALITY: is very good (no damages or something).SOUND: original MONO."
3,"some fine performances,","but they get lost in the morass of the film. IMHO, both Beatty and DeWilde are both just OK here; in spots, they both manage to overact, and quite a bit. I doubt either actor puts this one on their Top 10 list. Lansbury and Malden, on the other hand, are real standouts, but as I said, the mediocre script and stilted dialogue almost completely eclipses them. Worth seeing, but with a fast-forward botton at hand."
4,"Call Me Madam, a rare find","This original cast album (with one exception) is an excellent example of the Broadway musical ca. 1950, and the score by Irving Berlin is far better than anything you'd hear today. The exception, of course, is no Ethel Merman. Because of wrangling between rival record companies, she was unable to record with her Broadway colleagues. The surprise of this album is how good Dinah Shore is as her substitute. She shows verve without being brassy, she has purity of tone, and she doesn't belt, all features I found annoying with Madame Mermen, particular in her later career.This album, which has been out of circulation for decades, is a real find."
1,Faulty CD,"The cd I purchased looked like a copy (cd-r) and not an original. Each song ""hicuped"" trought out. I tried playing the cd on many players."
4,Good show-good recording,"I don't have the CD, but I do have the original LP release. I have always liked it and wondered when it would be released on CD (if ever). It's a very enjoyable show and it's good to have the original orchestrations and cast. The sound on the LP is good mono but rather boxy. I like Dinah Shore in the lead, but she slows down the tempo of some of the songs and can be rather stiff. Still, I like this better than the Decca/Merman recording as the Shore recording is more complete. If you can find it, get the soundtrack recording with Merman and Donald O'Connor. I have an LP version of it on UK/Ace of Hearts, and though it contains some cuts is by far the best recording."
4,This cd is great!,"This new cd by Rufio is definitly one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time! The guitar is melodious yet heavy and there is so much emotion. I dig this album, but I gave it a 4/5because the lead singers recording sound isn't so great, I mean really, in this day and age they can't make his voice a little louder on the CD."
5,Rufio is awesome,"Rufio are the gods of pop-punk. Just when I thought they couldn't get any better they did, with their sophmore album 1985. This cd is awesome. They have a more mature sound compared to their first Cd Perhaps I suppose. The songs are amazing. They're beautifully written and you can't help but just want to sing along. ""Follow Me"" is probably the most beautiful song you will ever hear. I highly recommend this cd to anyone willing to listen to an awsome band. So check it out for yourself."
3,The 80's rule,I love the 80's.Nice cd. Lead singer has an original voice.Cd ends in a wimper though. Last tracks should rock.hey i got a question: For how many albums can emo bands be heart-broken? lol!Or do their girls keep leavin em? pathetic.
4,RUFIO- 1985,"About 4 months ago, i got PERHAPS I SUPPOSE, i loved the lyrics the fast paced drums, the awsome vocals, and the catchy melodic guitars. Everysong was awsome, and it seemed like i could relate or put something thats happened in my life and it be just lke one of there songs. I put in 1985, and i think, whats with the vocals? It seems an effect was taken off his voice, because it is scratchy, and sort of seems sore. The whole cd has a vocal change, and i loved his vocals before, but these i got used to after awhile. The songs lyric wise are very good on the cd, but diffrent from p.I.s, The guitar work is very good on some songs, but some it seems boring. Unlike the last cd i give this a 4, because of minnor flaws, but this is just progression for the rufio team, and obviously this cd is differnt from the last..."
5,Better Than The First,Rufio really scores on this one. Having great songs like science fiction and whitelights its a keeper. Probably the best punk cd since Taking Back Sunday. And San Dimas High School Football rules because the Atris said so.
4,I Love Rufio,"A few of the tracks are really good; these tracks alone are worth more than the cost of the CD. A few of them suck and most of them are pretty good. This is their best CD in my opinion, although the others are good also. The only thing I don't like about them is that I heard from people who have met them that they're a bunch of snobs; this kinda turns me off to them, although I'm not sure how relevant that is. If you're into EMO / Punk & like NFG then you'll most likely want this CD."
3,"OK album, seems a bit more Emo this time","This album has a few great tracks, but it seems like this band is headin a bit towards Emotional. More like Dashboard Confessional, and its not bad, just dont expect the same from their last album ""Perhaps, i suppose""This album has 3 must have tracks, ""Follow me"", ""Countdown"", ""Goodbye"". The others are good as well but feels like they were fillers. Good, just not Great."
4,A band on the rise.,"Basically Rufio is one of the best bands around in the moment, steadily growing in popularity. This album is great and really shows the improvement the band has undergone. There is no way that this band will not make it big in both the states and England."
5,Whats with the roman numerals,"This CD rocks. This is the same general formula as GC, Simple Plan, and all of those bands. The difference here is that the formula is done extremely well. And I mean EXTREMELY well. It almost pains me to use Simple Plan in the same sentence as Rufio. They have some incredibly memorable riffs. See Pirate, Science Fiction, and White Lights. Rufio can master an insanely fast track such as We Exist and then shift to a slow song like Over It. Scott's voice is also infinitely better to an other singer from a comparable band. The drummer drums fast too. The best songs are um... all of them. Buy this CD now. Also buy CDs from Brand New, Thursday, Yellowcard, and Coheed and Cambria."
4,good stuff,"this album has some of the best guitar riffs i have ever heard and powerful lead singing. they are definitley one of the most talented bands out there. the only problem was that every song sounded similar. if they mixed up the speed and style a bit, they would be amazing. the standout track on this cd i would say is ""countdown."" it is a great and powerful opening track(cool drums too). though not as good an opener as above me, ""countdown"" is a strong showing of what the album is all about. although i cant compare 1985 to their other album because i havent heard all of perhaps, i suppose, i would defintley recommend it. this bands got the stuff and deserve to be big"
3,a bit disapointed...but still good.,"well wat can i say....i was a bit dispionted wid this album 1985....i was expected bigger and better things after there first album ""perhaps.....i suppose.i have been a fan for over a year.....i havent been lucky enough to c them live as they havent visited australia yet.But this album will grow on u.If ur a big fan BUY IT"
3,"Rufio ""1985""","Rufio's sound can be described as signature pop-punk. Their vocals remind me of the Ataris and their guitars remind me of blink-182. I am a fan of this style of music, but this album doesn't really do anything for me. Honestly, I don't know why, I just know I don't enjoy listening to it. This may sound pretty cliche, but a lot of the songs sound the same to me. There are some pretty good tunes, like ""White Lights"" and ""Science Fiction,"" but the rest are just average in my opinion.Rating: Three stars."
1,terrible mix - unbearable...,"i really liked perhaps i suppose, so i figured i'd pick this up. the music is good enough, not quite up to snuf against the first album though. but the mix is HORRENDOUS! you can barely hear the vocals! i can't even listen to it. don't waste your money; get perhaps i suppose, and stick with it."
1,AHHHH,"If you like such great bands such as Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Yellowcard, or Simple Plan...Then this band is for you!!! This is watered down pop-punk trash, just like almost every band in this genre. Where is the originality? Oh wait, there isnt any. Triumph the Comic dog would poop on this awful band."
2,Their album sucks and their live sucks too.,"All the songs on this album are mediocre and you can enjoy the same type of music on other albums from other better bands. The songs are just not that catchy and the singer's voice is whiny. On top of that, they wasted a whole lot of my time in concert because they sucked and i did not enjoy any of it. If u have the money to buy this, buy sumthing else instead."
5,Rufio has done it Again!,"What can I say? Rufio has done it once again. Their debut album (Perhaps, I Suppose) was a success, and this album the same. Many say their first album is way better than this one, what I say is they are very similar, and of course its Rufio quality. This band is just amazing. Just bought this CD and I cant get tired of it! All the song, and I mean it, are great! Same happened with their first album. They are in my opinion the best Punk rock band out there. Great lyrics, with awesome music. I would recommend you if you havent heard them yet to get their first album, since its a classic and you will understand why we are Rufio fans. A total success, worth the bucks."
2,i was dissapointed,"i dont know i liked it at first but got really bored of it, one song that they should have had on the cd was ""please dont hate me"" it was on their ep, songs that stand out-why wait-pirate-science fiction-set it offthats it, even though this cd is a wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better qualty sounding cd it doesnt even half way beat its freshman release ""perhaps.....i suppose""if you want a really good cd get****** thrice - artist in the ambulance *******"
2,More of the Same,"So. I've been listening to Rufio since way before anyone knew who they were, and hell I even hang out with the guys occasionally. This is not a big departure from any of their old stuff, which is a big disappointment. :/. The only difference is a that the drum riffs are more complicated, and the guitar work is awesome as always. If you're one of those kids who has just heard about Rufio, please do yourself a favor and buy ""Perhaps, I Suppose."" It's a better album in my opinion, even if it is a bit old.I'm just hoping that Rufio will allow themselves to grow and change musically. This CD sounds like a repeat of everything else they've done, but with less heart and soul put into it."
3,Overall the Album is Fair,"RUFIO is a good band but this is not a very good album for the band. I discovered RUFIO around a year and half ago when I purchased the Nitro Compilation Punkzilla which featured their song ""still"". Amazing song, soon after I bought their album ""Perhaps, I suppose"". Well I was excited to hear that they were having a new CD come out (1985); however, I was disappointed after hearing it.First off, the instrumentals aren't as good on this record as the previous. Listen to the main riff to ""Above Me"" on their last record and you'll be amazed. On this new album there is nothing unique or special about it. The lyrics aren't as good as the last. The CD isn't horrible but if you just heard about RUFIO DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! Buy their first release instead."
5,Freakin Awesome!,The new Rufio album is awesome! But without a doubt i love both of their albums equally! If you like punk rock then you will love Rufio! I can't wait till they have another concert in Jacksonville! Oh yeah and if ya don't get the album i'll hunt ya down and beat you with a very large stick!
1,What the Hell were they thinking?,"This is the worst Rufio cd ever. I was soo dissapointed. Rufio used to be one of my favorite bands, but after their new CD came out, that all changed. I don't know what they were thinking. If you're a true Rufio fan, don't buy this CD. Stick to the old stuff."
1,listen to something else,"... For me, I dont see what is so spectacular about this band. All of the songs become superfluous. ... For all of you guys who said that they loved those lyrics from ""Perhaps"" <i feel a quote coming> ""Lyrically, Rufio does try to sound poetic but fails on so many levels. ""I sit and hear you sleep, I don't want to go. You're there beside me, but you're so far away. I talk to you, while you're asleep. You can't hear a word, you can hear everything."" I would like to say that ""you can't hear a word"" and ""you can hear everything"" is a nice dichotomy but it is simply [not common sense]. And how exactly do you hear someone sleep? Does the line ""I talk to you"" mean that you are telling this girl to stop the ... snoring?."" If this album is supposedly not up to par with ""Perhaps"", as other reviewers have said, then this album is truly weak, and one should definitely keep away from it."
5,Awesome but.... one complaint,"The music on the cd is amazing. If any of you read the last issue of Alternative Press, they gave it a 4 only because the producer buried the vocals, and their review is right on. The music is great just like all Rufio albums but you can hardly hear him in some parts. Buy it though, its awesome."
1,I think I've heard this album before...,"It is indeed strange that on the day of this release, an album entitled ""Deja Entendu"" was released. Unlike that album (released by the band Brand New), which really was a complete recreation of the band, we do have something released that everyone has heard before. ""1985"" is almost an exact recreation of ""Perhaps...I suppose"", and it really was rather bland and terrible the first time around. The guys are pretty skillful musicians, but the rhythm/lyrics/delivery is almost exactly the same on every song. Unless you are 14 and enjoy song after immature song about girls/heart ache, then I highly recommend passing this one up."
3,Still sounding fine!,"I really enjoyed this collection from Russell Smith, circa 2002. All of the new songs are solid efforts, and I really liked ""Walk These Hills' up there with the best stuff that he's ever done. Good versions of two Aces songs and one from his first solo effort. I enjoy this collection more with each listen. I count myself among those who wonder why he isn't a bigger name that he is. Quality stuff!Ramblin' Rusty"
5,the end is not in sight,"Vintage Russell Smith! Awesome, wonderful, and exciting. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys The Amazing Rhythm Aces."
2,I would go local in the future to see what I'm getting,I bought this netting to replace one over my Koi pond. We have blue heron and racoons so the netting is really necessary. I have a very nice looking pond and do not want a net that takes away from that anymore than necessary. Imagine my surprise when I unroll the net and find a splice from one side to the other. The netting is black and the splice is sewed with white thread and has a lip that hangs down 3 inches. It's a real eyesore. If it is going to have a splice I think this is something they should tell you. As I said I will go local in the future to see what I am getting. I have bought this size before without any splices and was quite happy with it. Maybe it was a different company.
3,Great product..for a while,"Even though I am only giving this product 3 stars, I would continue to buy it again (and have). The problem with the product, and they don't say it is supposed to do this, but after a typically extremely hot Houston summer, this net will get weaker, and start to tear. I guess my word of warning would be,be aware that in extreme heat and humidity this product will struggle to maintain it's structure. It's cheap enough and easy enough through amazon, just plan on changing the net in the fall, and once in the spring and it will do fine"
5,Keeps the leaves out!,"We recently enlarged our pond and needed a larger net. Because of the shape of the pond, we ordered two of these nets and joined them by weaving them together with nylon twine. We made a tent above the pond so that the birds would still have access to the water on each end. Even with the weight of wet leaves on the sides of the ""tent"", the net has held together and kept our pond entirely clear of leaves and debris. Very sturdy. Good product. I would highly recomend."
5,Pool Cover Cover!,I purchased this to go over my solid winter pool cover. Now as the leaves fall I can simply removed the netting and dump the leaves! No more trying to get the leaves off the water as it fills with water. Should make the spring time draining process much easier as I won't have leaves clogging the drain hose.
4,Perfect fit for 1999 Accord,"No problem replacing motor, very easy. The shop wanted to charge me $320 to replace this motor. It cost me $39 for the motor took me 15 minutes to replace(I am not a mechanic either)."
3,Not what I expected...,"I am a nursing student, and I was hoping for more information on interviewing and finding the ""right"" kind of hospital. Although it was a very quick read, I did not find this book incredibly useful in my job search as a new grad!!"
2,Disappointed in Samsung DVD3650 combo unit,I am disappointed in the unit. It was advertised to have VCD playback ability. It will not even recognize any VCD's at all. I give it 2 stars only because the progressive component output is a feature I was after too. It is a very quirky unit though. When using the progressive DVD output you are only able to program or view the VCR menu from the DVD component output even though the VCR is only output on composite or RF modulated outputs. Big dissapointment for a Samsung product. Had counted on it playing back VCD's so now it is only good for a guest bedroom.
1,On Second Thought!,"I gave my review too quickly! It seemed okay at first. Then I hooked it up, it the trouble began.The auto setup would not run. I could not do the setup manually because the unit thought there was a DVD in the tray. However, the DVD tray would NOT open! Also, the buttons on the unit responded intermittently, I had to use the remote. The product manual was useless, with no info on how to troubleshoot a stuck tray.The real surprise is that the VCR deck had a tape in it...obviously from quality control. It appears this unit failed quality control and still made it off the prodution line. The problem is Samsung, not Amazon.I returned the unit to Amazon and bought a Panasonic combo (PV-D4743S Progressive-Scan) for $10 more from Best Buy. It works like a dream. and, the instruction manual has info on how to handle a stuck tray. The features are awesome, both DVD and VCR. Remote is easy to use."
1,Did not work,"The DVD player froze after playing a disc for an hour. The problem occurred with every disc played. The VCR player is also loud. There is a buzz that is distinctly audible while the tape is playing. The unit was returned and a SONY was purchased. After two weeks, there have no problems with the SONY."
1,Defective,"I've had several DVD players in the last 8 years, and this was the first that failed to work. The VCR played, however setting it up to communicate with the cable system repeatedly recieved an error message. Before I had a chance to sort out if it was the unit or the cable company, I realized that the DVD player would't work. After an hour wait with Samsung helpdesk, they quickly determined that the unit was defective.I've decided that the convenience of a combo DVD/VCR is not worth the complications, so this unit was quickly boxed up and sent back for refund.The only good news is that Amazon has a great return policy ... get on the web, note the problem, print out a UPS packing slip and drop it off at the UPS store at no cost."
3,OK product,"I bought this as Christmas present for my wife. It works fine, nice sleek slim design. Has universal remote, can operate my existing RCA TV. However the remote controls is a big drawback, has cumbersome buttons, its Fast Forward, Rewind and slow motion buttons are confusing. When the DVD is still inside the player, it will turn on itself when turned off manually while watching TV. Also forcing me to press TV/VCR button every time I press the TV. After two weeks, decided to take back to store for a different product, Toshiba. Will review on it shortly."
1,DVD tray wouldn't open right out of the box.,I bought this primarily because of it's small foot print. Other DVD/VCR combo units are much larger. As soon as I got it home and connected it up I tried to open the DVD tray to play a DVD. The tray wouldn't open. It's going straight back to Best Buy first thing in the morning. What a piece of junk!!!!
3,Fell short of expectations,"I wanted to love this stuff, I really did, but it's just not living up to it's hype. I bought the natural coconut, because I love the smell of coconut and didn't want any other scents added. The smell is okay, but a bit too sweet and heavy for my taste, not as light as I had hoped. Also, I'm not terribly impressed with it's skin softening abilities either...again, it's okay, but nothing extraordinary. It does soak right in, and leaves absolutely no oily residue. I haven't used it on my hair yet, so the verdict is still out on that. All in all I'd have to say it's been fairly mediocre and under-whelming so far."
3,Smells Nice But Hardens in the Cold,"This oil smells lovely but it can be difficult if you use it in colder weather - in my bathroom it hardened even with the heat on. I had to thaw it in the shower, which took quite some time. I suspect this will be something I use during the summer only."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I read the reviews and was hopeful when I ordered this oil. I was extremely disappointed, however, when it arrived. The oil isn't moisturizing at all - I get better results from St. Ives lotion. The smell is a bit bizarre for ""vanilla"" - it smells more like a muted vanilla plant than the vanilla smell I am used to. I will stick with my St. Ives moisturizer, as this did nothing for me. I threw it in the trash."
5,Smells great and makes skin feel super silky!,I have used this product for over 5 years and love it! I also mix it with several of my other body lotions to create custom fragrances and give it a less oily feel. But it smells great by itself and adds a nice sheen to skin when used alone or with other products.
4,Awesome,"Awesome product. I love it. it does make you smell sweet though, just in case you're not into strong sweet smells."
4,This is a very good book covering Distributed Powerbuilder,This book is very helpful in covering all of the details of building an Distributed PB Application. I recommend it for others to read for it is very helpful and informative.
4,Quit stalling and see Bums,"I came to learn about the Butler Brothers through my excellent girlfriend Karen, who appears in Bums. Her performance was a shocker and fits perfectly into the world Butlers have created with seemingly effortless skill. The film is an engaging, hilarious, offbeat day in the life comedy that holds a skewed mirror up to your circle of friends and mine. Anyone who sees this is going to know someone like the people in this film, and its this familiarity that makes the characters and the story work. A really good piece of work from a very unique production company whose DIY attitude is a real inspiration for anyone out there interested in making movies. Or getting laid."
5,Witty sages,"Bums was one of those films that I had to show to all of my friends. Bizarre, familiar, troubled life philosophies; great homage to pop culture that formed our generation; and plenty of wit. The characters are very real and some of the lines are classics on their own. A great way to prime up before playing the modern courting game. Much truth in the film."
1,Poor Quality Control,"What a nifty idea! Too bad their quality control stinks.The first one was defective, and so was the second (replacement). Never did get to charge my laptop... It looks like the device sets the voltage based on the tip you use, and certain tips require more volts. With both iGo Juice adapters I tried they were unable to properly power certain tips -- presumably the higher voltage ones, such as the one my laptop (a Toshiba) requires. When I called iGo, Customer support promptly declared them ""defective"" and said to return them. At least they acknowledge the problem...Amazon.com's support when returning them has been great."
5,Great Tool for Road Warrior,"I've been using the juice iGo system for about 8 months. It is a real space and weight saver for the frequent traveler. I have used is successfully with my Toshiba Portege 3505, my Sony Clie, and Sony T68i cell phone including the bluetooth headset. I can travel with one charger instead of three and it easily plugs in to the adapter outlets on airplanes as well as in automobiles.I can keep my laptop and cell phone or PDA charged at the same which is especially helpful in hotels with limited power outlets.It has held up well on countless trips and I have had no issues to date (no breakage like some other reviewers for example). If you are looking for a second power adapter for your notebook I would highly recommend this for its flexibility and convenience."
1,Juice 70 review,"I bought one of these handy little items for about a hundred bucks at Radio Shack during an emergency when I had to have a recharger for my Toshiba. It lasted about 6 mos. If you want a really neat charger that lasts 6 mo for about a hundred dollars go ahead a buy one. What a piece of junk. Plan ahead, order a replacement charger for your computer right now so when it goes down you won't get taken by this made in China piece of junk."
3,Not reliable enough,My second IGO died. I replaced my first one after the connector to the power unit broke. My second was of moody character and would go on strike every few hours. However I took it along around the world but ultimately the blue light died for good. This is a great concept but the quality of the manufacture is not what heavy users need.
3,i don't go juice,I have/had been using the juice since October of last year. Worked great until the AC portion stopped working a couple weeks ago. DC portion still works. I noticed Targus makes a similar unit and user feedback for that unit indicates a similar problem. Contacted Mobility customer service for assistance and they were very helpful. Can't do an exchange though since they need a receipt and I got the unit from work (no receipt).
2,Doesn't Charge Dell Batteries,"One thing that one needs to be aware of is that this does NOT charge Dell batteries, and therefore can't really be used as a replacement for a Dell adapter. I suggest you skip this overpriced item and just purchase a Dell charger (1/3 the price as well). Also, it seems to run quite hot--I've been warned that too much use might fry my motherboard."
2,Good idea - poor design,"While the iGo Juice is a great idea and potentially useful for travellers, after 4 uses the end that connects to the PC adapter snapped right off. The design of the tip is far too flimsy especially for travel. (Two of the four uses were at home, two on the road)Calling technical support didn't help either - no return call after two attempts.Good idea - poor design, not great customer service. If Mobility improve their design, I'd certainly consider trying again. But until then - back to one plug per gadget!"
3,Make sure it fits your laptop,"I picked up a Juice at Radio Shack in Nehsaminy Mall, PA. The salesguy assured me it'd fit my Inspiron 5150..since the 5000 is listed. It seems well designed, elegant and I like the idea of getting juice no matter where I am.. the whole bag with cords isn't much bigger than the brick from Dell.Wish I'd tried it before leaving the store..it doesn't fit.The preceeding review says ""If, for some reason the Juice does not come with a tip that is compatible with your laptop, they will send you one free of charge"" -- this is WRONG.. they can't support every wacky laptop.If if they don't have tip you're -out of luck-. Tech support got back to me quickly to confirm this. So..do your homework, and don't believe everything salespeople tell you!"
1,"Next Time, iGo To Another Brand","At eighteen months old, my iGo Juice adapter has developed the 'blinking diode' symptom that other iGo Juice owners report on the Internet. It will not power my laptop now, unless warmed up for about two hours, and unless I keep pressing the laptop's power switch. Eventually, it 'catches' and the laptop will come on.For an adapter that is so costly and is advertised as an all-in-one solution to one's travel power needs, eighteen months does not feel like an acceptable lifespan. It is certainly not acceptable to have a two-hour warmup before the device will work. I'm disappointed, and I'm going back to a dedicated, 'factory' adapter for my laptop."
1,Not Compatible with Dell Lattitude D600,"The iGo websitre is wrong, and these people do not have a compatible tip for the dell latitude series notebooks. Customer service was horrible. I pitty people that have to deal with this company. At least I got out early."
5,jim thorpe all american,I WAS VERY HAPPY TO RECEIVE MY DVD AND THE QUALITY AND SERVICE WAS FIRST CLASS AND I HAVE TOLD MY FRIENDS ABOUT YOUR MARVELOUS SERVICE AND PRODUCTKIND REGARDS RICHARD WOODINGS.
5,JIM THORPE ALL AMERICAN,"Jim thorpe-all american released in 1951 is one of the best of the bios. great performances of burt lancaster,charles bickford and phyllis thaxter,the story of jim thorpe an indian from oklahoma began his rise to fame in all professional sports to his downfall much a do to predjudice to him and to himself as an alcoholic.The greatest athlete in the world was stripped of his gold medals from the 1912 olympics due to him playing some professional sports for cash during his time off from college.This film does not do justice to tell the full story of thorpe in 105 minutes,but this movie does give us a glance of what thorpe went through during his life.Burt lancaster does an outstanding job of thorpe's portrayal of a man trying to cope with life and its predjudice.This warner release is a nice copy the picture is clear and the sound is vibrant.Jim thorpe all american is an outstanding gem of a movie about a man who is definetley the greatest athlete in the world....."
4,Wonderful Book,"The Jim Thorpe dvd is quite wonderful because it seems to be produced factually, i.e., without too much undue embellishment (that is, not too much ""Hollywood"") but simply a vivid portrayal of Jim Thorpe's life and accomplishments. Another quality it has has to do with its subject matter: Jim Thorpe as a Native American, a heroic role model. Excellent treatment of the subject!Simon J. Ortiz"
5,"Great story, well-told","_Jim Thorpe_ is nominally a story about a great athlete; it is more a complex, bittersweet portrayal of a man whose frustrated ambition threatens to tear him and his family apart. This movie underlines in bold strokes the damaging effects of racism, both external and internalized, and the fact that material success is no compensation for dignity and self-respect."
4,Interesting Story Of An Amazing Athlete,"This was an enjoyable, interesting biography and another instance of Burt Lancaster giving an intense acting performance.Sure, this is revisionist history here but it did show both the good and bad sides of Thorpe, one of America's all-time greatest athletes who excelled almost a century ago. Some still think he is the best athlete ever in the history of the United States.Lancaster was in great shape to play Thorpe which helped make him look convincing as a top athlete. Charles Bickford was very good as ""Pop Warner,"" Thorpe's dedicated coach and a famous sports figure in his own right. Phyllis Thaxter was wholesomely attractive as Jim's wife.None of the leading actors who were Native Americans, as Thorpe was, are played by actual Indians but that's classic-era Hollywood. It takes away from some of the realism of the film.The movie features a good mix of melodrama and sports and interesting characters. It's good entertainment."
4,Jaws of Africa!,"This is an underrated classic though I am happy to see here on the amazon that it is rated rather high by this netshops' reviewers. Well earned stars!You've probably already heard the essential of the story, but let me just add that this movie is perhaps the best Beast-above-water-movies ever made (compared of course to Jaws, Brotherhood of the Wolf and similar movies about beasts out of animals that do exist, unlike Kong and Godzilla and the dinosaurs of Jurrasic Park -yes, well, you get my meaning...).More than once during The Ghost and The Darkness you'll hold your breath, and sit paralyzed to your chair, because it is so impressive filmed, edited and (of course) directed and acted. Kilmer and Douglas are a great theme! And the movie has quite a lot remembarable scenes, and the story (though perhaps not as true as it claims to be..?) is solid, and well worth making a movie of.And the film-makers here did well!The lions look real!"
4,Oldie but goodie,"I gave this four stars because of the part Michael Douglas totally made up for himself, ha ha. But we forgive him. The story is interesting and really happened in Tsavo. But mostly this is eye candy for me - Michael and Val at their best! Don't get me wrong, very good acting from everyone involved. As they mention in the movie, lions do not act like that - something else was going on there. If one is not able to figure out what that is, then it is probably hopeless anyway and I don't want to get all preachy. You will want to read the book for background on this strange incident. Incredible story. The scenery is beautiful. There is proper suspense. Several characters that we liked are knocked off, but that was the way it was, unfortunately. Note: If you order the book from Amazon, make sure they record what you actually order and don't try to slip something different in there - watch your orders."
1,it sucked,it sucked because this movie is based on real events that happened and 55 minutes into the movie the sound started messing up and the picture started skiping
3,Movie GREAT dvd BAD BAD BAD,the movie is great but the dvd is empty...THE RATE FOR THE MOVIE IS 4.5...THE RATE FOR THE DVD IS 2THE ALL RATE IS 3
3,too dark,most of this movie is filmed in the dark & you can't see half of what is going on. Plot was good but it needed to be a lot lighter.
4,Ghost and the Darkness,"Great cinematography! Lots of excitement and drama. Michael Douglas is great in his character. Not a big Val Kilmer fan, but he does a good job in this one. These lions are stuffed and in the Field Museum in Chicago."
4,excellent DVD transfer to a good film,"Loosely based off of a true story, this is an intriguing film that does actually get you on the edge of your seat in some of the sequences. Excellent editing and some solid camera work depicting the lion's point of view keep things fresh and original.This film looks magnificent on DVD, with the image quality truly beautiful. The blades of grass in the African fields are crisp and sharp and the countryside mastershots are superb. The sound is exceptional and Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic score make this film all the more watchable. Too bad you only get the trailer and no other goodies. An isolated score would have been excellent."
2,Entertaining but bad dialogue,"This film tells a fictionalised account of two lions that attacked and killed railroad workers in Tsavo, Kenya during the building of the British-operated Uganda-Mombasa Railway in 1898.Some of the characters in this movie are sort of endearing and I admit I did find myself caring about who did or didn't get eaten by the man-eating lions (Michael Douglas, Val Kilmer, John Kani, Henry Cele, etc.). But that's about all I can say for this movie. The dialogue made me cringe, and there was almost no character development. The movie's attempt to portray cross-cultural friendship was pretty embarrassing as well. There was just no subtlety, anywhere."
1,still waiting for this item,its has being four weeks and still waiting for the item. Not sure if this is a good vendor to work with....
2,Ghost Does not Deliver,"Film of this sort had great potential, but the lions just were not scary enough. Great location filming, but Douglas and Kilmer were not given enough on-screen time together for any chemistry to develop. Douglas character does not enter movie until an hour into the plot. Story is about Kilmer accepting job to build bridge in Africa in 1898 until lions start messing up the works. If you want to see a good bridge movie minus the lions then rent Bridge on the River Kwai which is excellent."
1,"Movie was great, DVD very poor.","I actually had two copies of this DVD, ""The Ghost and The Darkness"". I tried playing them on three different DVD players. Both copies on all 3 DVD drives the picture shacks and shimmers through out the movie. I would have liked not having to return it, as I did enjoy the movie. But Paramount needs to control quality. I did buy both copies in different retail outlets."
3,a good watch if you dont take it as anything more than a glorified ramar of the jungle,"as long as nobody tries to overlay this adventure tale with philosophical metaphors and such, im cool with this movie. sadly, it lends itself to that sorta tretment. i dont usually like val kilmer but he manages not to emote here, and though i think michael douglas is miscast as the great white hunter, he manages to turn in a professional job. suspenseful & exciting."
5,Great Movie!,I had been looking for this movie for awhile. It is very suspenseful and shows thatt things are not always the way we think they should be. There is always room for something a little different because nothing in this world is set in stone.
5,Exciting true story!,"One of my all time favorites. Scary because it is a true story of the Man Eaters of Tsavo. The real lions are in Chicago and have shorter mains, but other than that--awesome."
5,"After Out of Africa, this is one of the best!","What a great story. Mostly true. The Remington character never existed, but most of the other stuff did. An amazing tale, beautifully photographed, and very accurate as to costumes, firearms, etc. If you don't like hunting, you still may like this one....from the lion's point of view :-) Widescreen edition is very good quality. Would love to see it on blue-ray."
5,great hunting movie,"""The Ghost and the Darkness"" is an entertaining film about Patterson's huntfor the maneating lions of Tsavo, a pair of lions that killed many native workerson the African railroad and stopped work on a bridge. The film takes some libertieswith the reality of the hunt, but is an exciting adventure that big game hunters willenjoy. Well worth the purchase."
1,"Great movie, terrible quality","I purchased this movie thinking I would receive high quality. The movie is in a small format that didn't come close to filling my 46"" HD TV. Very disappointed. It was not very clear either."
2,Great Movie,"This is one of the best movies ever. However the picture quality was poor and the movie was in letterbox, which I hate. I was expecting better. I have a VHS tape that shows better on my LCD HD Television than this DVD did. DISAPPOINTED!!!"
5,Awesome!! Loved this movie and have watched it over and over!!,Ok the first thing that is great about this movie is that I am a huge Val Kilmer fan and the second I love Africa!! The lions were wonderful and I love Remington to!! Just all in all a great movie and everyone who doesn't know the true story you have to at least see the movie!!
4,Good movie,"What's freaky about this movie is that it's based on a true story and you can still see the lions stuffed in some museum in Chicago. What's great about this movie, is it's one of the first of it's kind. There have since been several ""evil animal"" movies that are ridiculous, but this one was true and original. Some pretty intense scenes in this!"
5,Simply amazing,"Allright a couple weeks ago I found this movie in my parents shelf and I asked my mom if I've ever seen it. She said I had when I was really young (about 3) and I didn't remember any of it. So I put it in the old tape player and was shocked at how great it was. I'm so surprised I didn't remember it. The movie is great, and the story that actually happened is just plain shocking. The movie is about engineers working on a bridge in Tsavo Africa. And at night two man-eating lions murdered and gruesomly mauled many workers. The movie defiantly has it's ammount of gore but more amount of drama in a way you wouldn't think. The drama for me is thinking what it was like for those actual workers during that time. Just shocking. Great movie and I highly reccomend it."
2,"Product presented great, but not suitable for the Australian region 4 DVD format.","The DVD was an excellently presented product.I have however given it a low score as I live in Australia, which is rated as region 4 for DVD's and as the above DVD sent ot me was formatted for Region1 ( USA).Therefore I cannot play the DVD on my player and feedback from Amazon has indicated, that you cannot supply a region 4 DVD to me, consequently I cannot rate the product to my satisifaction."
4,A Great Adventure Film,"BASED on a true story. The key word is ""BASED.""Not quite a historically accurate portrayal of the real events surrounding the lions of Tsavo, but one whale of a story and tightly suspenseful movie. In my opinion, it deserves to be considered a classic alongside such films as ""High Noon"" and ""The Professionals."""
5,The Gost and The Darkness,This Movie ROCKS!!! I loved it from start to finnish... on another note the Book was also very good (The Lions of Tsavo)
5,A thriller,"Ghost and the Darkness........ keeps you on the edge of your seat... I read an article on rogue lions, and this film is very authentic and actually could be based on facts... Great acting by Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer... actually it is one of my favorites by both those powerful actors... I surely recommend anyone to watch this film, as it is a thriller."
5,Ghost and the Darkness,It was a Christmas gift for my fiance. He hadn't seen it since he was younger and couldn't find it anywhere.
4,Ghost of the Darkness- movie,"I bought this movie as a gift for a friend and have not had the chance to watch it myself. I bought it for her because she had it on VCR tape and enjoyed it so much that it was getting worn out, so I purchased it for her on DVD."
2,Umgawa!,"It's the late 1800s, and a British company is building a railroad bridge in Africa. There are, of course, personality conflicts, ethnic complications, a deadline, and some lovely sunsets. On top of all that, two man-eating lions rumored to have supernatural powers -- or at least a very bad attitude -- consume dozens of workers, leading to an employee walkout. It's time to call in the Great White Hunter!"
1,What the hell?,This movie is just sad. Is this what humanity is coming to? killing Man-eating lions? If this movie does something it promoted cruelty to animals. Save yourself some time and don't watch it.
3,A great adventure undone by miscasting,"..... That said i like this movie in spite of the flaws. I found it a nice throw back to the adventure movies of the 50's. Before i get to the good let's get the bad out of the way, Michael Douglas(who produced the movie) and Val Kilmer are both good actors but just don't ""click"" in their roles and throw the film out of whack. Douglas less so than Kilmer because his is really just a cameo at best which leaves Kilmer to carry the movie and he is so uptight in the film you just don't feel for him as you should. Ok now the good,this leaves us with just a action movie that is well,if not greatly done. With nothing to hang your emotions on the action is what's left. A good adventure, but with the talent involved this should have been much better."
3,Flawed action/suspense film,"The Ghost and the Darkness has two big things going for it: a surprisingly complex and intriguing performance from Michael Douglas, and some tense action sequences. What it has going against are Val Kilmer delivering another uncharismatic performance and plenty of action cliches. Granted, the movie is fun to a certain extent where you don't really notice some of the flaws but the simple fact is, the film really should have been a lot better. Watch it for the action, but don't expect plot depth."
5,'The Devil has come to Tsavo',"This is one of the best adventure/suspense movies ever made and deserves ten stars! Well written and paced, even the music chosen was excellent in keeping the tension at the proper level. Douglas and Kilmer are terrific, believable characters as they round out an already intense story based on two real lions who terrorized an area of Africa. I saw one of the stuffed lions at the Field Museum in Chicago (don't know where the other one was that day) and it truly did send a chill down my spine. If you love action/adventure, or just superb acting period, buy this one for your shelf. My only regret is that it doesn't have the added director commentary or special added features that we are spoiled with when we buy more recent DVD's. Though I could only put five stars, this is a ten star movie!!! Be sure to also pick up a copy of Patterson's book 'The Man Eaters of Tsavo' for more info on the real lions.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,The Not-So-Sunnyside,"This brisk, unpredictable page-turner is the perfect antidote for the more commonplace pulp that is typically associated with this genre. A martini-optional mystery of the highest order!"
4,suspenseful and pleasant reading,"this mystery is crisp and has a freshness to it. The plot is easy to follow, the content is clean."
4,Beauty and Brains,"I am in the middle of watching the series and looking forward to the next 2 volumes.I will simply add my ""me too"" in regards the beauty of the animation and the dense and interesting plot. I am thoroughly enjoying both.I wanted to inform readers that the added features are not particularly worth bothering with. The historical notes are good, especially if you have no background in the period. The 'commentaries' are next to worthless, consisting of rambling conversations about 'who we know' and 'how wonderful you are'. If you are a rabid anime fan you might find them an interesting insider view--but for the rest of us the rare mention of what's happening on the screen make them a waste of time.So, yes well worth it for the program itself, forget about most of the 'extras'."
3,Do not buy if you have widescreen HDTV,I ordered this set based on the reviews. 1st DVD played good in widescreen mode (with no black bars either at top/bottom or sides). When I played the 2nd DVD there is no option to select widescreen mode on this. The movie started playing with 2 sidebars which is not great to watch. I am giving only 3 stars because the DVD quality is good.
5,Excellent service and price,"Excellent service and price, I got exactly what I wanted at a bargin price"
5,Great!,"Great transaction. Item received in time for Christmas and was as advertised- brand new, just like from the store:)Thank you!"
5,BITCHIN' ROCK N ROLL,"NOT A STINKER ON THIS ONE. ROCK ANTHEMS, NO WIMPS. THE REAL ROCK N ROLL DEAL. FIRE IT UP!!!"
1,Crude Interpretation,"Tolkien was an outsider. Chance mischaracterizes him as a soap box, Land of Hope and Glory, Rule Britannia jingoist. His basic artistic credo is found in Leaf by Niggle which expresses an artists disaffection with his society, England. Chance's agenda is reductive and banal, and in fact Tolkien explicitly repudiated this simplistic interpretation. Tolkien wrote fantasy literature not propaganda. He was an artist not a politician."
2,Poor Finish,"This pen was a beautiful pen until the 2nd day of use when the gold finish on the clip just disintegrated. The pen had no exposure to any chemicals and had only been on my desk, in my pocket or in my hand. Although it writes fine and I like the grip, I can't recommend it. I wonder if this is the reason they are on sale for half price?"
4,A good enough gangster movie...,"This movie was better than i expexted it to be. Really delving into the mob and mafia families, showing the lives of fear and the danger of living as a wiseguy. For example vouching for someone who dosn't deliver gets you killed. So imagine the danger that an undercover FBI agent is in. There you have Donnie Brasco. A great movie, really tense, and showing a side of wiseguys not usually shown in the movies in the Pacino character 'Lefty' who is poor and basically a donkey worker. With great acting from Al and Depp, the only thing that lets this movie down from 5 stars is the scatty story which is based on actual events. A bit here and there though i thought. All in all a great movie. Enjoy!"
4,Doonie Brasco,"Donnie Brasco is a modern classic. The script is realistic, the direction is focused and the sets are atmospheric. Is Donnie Brasco a good movie, Fuhget about it."
5,A Very Cool Movie,"Besides having a great script and superb acting, this film is special for another reason. Throughout film history many actors have tried to capture the essence of being cool. James Dean paved the way in his performance in Rebel Without A Cause. In my opinion, Johnny Depp creates a character that goes to that same level. It's the type of movie you'll watch over and over. This is my favorite movie of all time and I think one of the best great actor teams in Pacino and Depp. Buy this movie if you love a great drama. If you have a problem with vulgarity, this might not be the movie for you."
3,extended scenes already in the origial cut,5 stars for better picture quality. Very clean picture quality. Great sound mix.3 stars for the new cut. Prefer the original cut.2 stars since the deleted scences are already in the original cut1 star... No new features. Missing commentary.
5,Excellent movie... and it just got better,"I loved this movie when it originally came out. The casting is spot on and this Blu-ray edition shows it off like it was meant to be seen. A definite must have for any fan of Depp, Pacino, and mobster flicks."
3,Not the best..,"Donnie Brasco should have been a great movie. The book was an excellent read. However, the movie did not do it justice, as it changed many parts. Goodfellows did it right- Brasco did it wrong. Disappointing..."
5,THis movie is awesome!,"I picked up this book in the library and could not put it down and decided I HAD to own this DVD. Although the movie differs from the book on a few points, it is still true to the story and tells it with such emotion. You can feel Donnie's heartbreak at betraying his friend and you can see the hurt in the ""wiseguys"" who don't want to believe Donnie was from the other side. Excellent movie, excellent book, buy them both!"
4,Great gangster film,"I like this film. Al Pacino plays his role just right. This is also the Extended cut, which was the first time i saw it. I like the newly added scenes. I think it improved the film and made it more complete. I also like Michael Madsen in the film and his character. 1 of my favourite scenes is when they beat the Japanese guy.Picture quality: 4.5/5I think it looks pretty sharp and detailed with all the film grain intact, as it should be. Colours look nice and such. Nothing to complains about. I think it has more or less reference quality.Audio quality: 4.5/5I compared the LPCM 5.1 and the noticable poorer Dolby Digital 5.1 against each other. Everything sounds better in the LPCM 5.1 mix. I think it was very clear and pretty good quality.Film: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5"
5,Donnie Brasco Movie ~ DVD,"WOW!!! To these two actors!! This movie really brings out Johnny Depps acting ability. If you like Goodfellows you will absolutely love this movie. Grab a bowl of popcorn, a soda, and get ready for the adventure it takes you one. Mafia at it's best."
5,It doesn't get much better than this.,"A great storyline with great actors. It never gets old, do not miss this movie."
5,Great movie,"Al Pacino, Johnny Depp. They acted well and story is good. Classic and definitely worth to include this title in my collection."
5,movie,Another Depp Classic. He plays a man who is in the FBI who has to go undercover in the mob. Its like 21 Jumpstreet but all grown up!
3,ALMOST>>>>......,this movie can be a real drag....this movie just doesnt cut it in any collection....the only reason i can think of someone buying this DVD is to fill up ur Al Pacino collection. This movie is in a way similar to Blow...but it doesn't keep your attention...
3,"Not good enough, despite the strong ratings by others","I'm apparently among the minority of viewers who found this movie watchable, but not great. True, the risk of Donny Brasco getting caught maintained a tension which kept me engaged with the movie. But otherwise there was very little development of the characters, the circumstances of essentially every character were bleakly depressing with no detectable bright side, and the bits of violence in the movie had a tacked-on quality which doesn't do justice to the brutality of the mafia. Frankly, I found this movie somewhat boring, despite being a fan of this genre. If you want to see how it should be done, watch The Sopranos, The Godfather, etc. By comparison, this was amateurish. Though I wouldn't say the two hours I spent on this movie were completely wasted, there are certainly many better movies I could have watched ..."
4,True-To-Life; Excellent Movie!,"Based on the life of a young FBI agent who infiltrates the underground world of the largest and most deadly mafia family in New York. You will enjoy this movie if you want something in the quality range of The Godfather but showing the mob from another perspective. Excellent. Don't rent it, buy it!"
5,"One of the best, most accurate Mafia portrayals I ever saw!","Next to Goodfellas, this is the best, most accurate Mafia portrayal I have ever seen. Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, James Russo, Anne Heche and Bruno Kirby worked very well together, and could not have done any better. I even started to believe that Johnny Depp was really one of them. This is the kind of movie you will want to watch more than once. Buy It now! You won't regret it!"
2,"True, but Sad Movie.","Sorry, but I did not like this movie. It was sad more than anything. I know Lefty was a killer and criminal, I could not help but feel sorry for him when he realized that his pal, ""Donnie"" was really an undercover officer. He had to play it off in front of his associates like it was nothing. The saddest part was when he realized that they were going to come get him, so he tells his wife to tell ""donnie"" that he liked working with him and doesn't regret it just in case he were to call. Then he goes into the next room to leave his watch, wallet, and some stuff behind for his wife before leaving their home because he could not tell her what was going down, and just had to face the inevitable. I know that he was a criminal, but it was still too sad to watch."
5,Highly recommend,"Excellent movie - delivery was fast, price was good and the product was exactly as advertised."
3,Only 3 stars? Yes....,"Frankly, I only saw most of this. It was broadcast on CBS on March 12th....maybe they'll do it again sometime? (shameless plea to any execs reading this! ) It was interesting. Too violent for me, but as its' a mob film, that is to be expected. Al Pacino does a good job as a downtrodden mob lackey who befriends a undercover FBI agent (Depp) who, in turn, gets further and further into the mob society while neglecting his family....a good job, though, in showing us his feelings and not condemning him for doing so. There are several subtle metaphors, the most hilarious (to me) being the one of the gift of the lion. The lion....in the backseat of a new car. Now is that absolute power or what? Good film, all around--just not my piece of cake."
4,It's True,How can you loose with a story like this with Pacino and Depp playing the leading rolls !! One good movie.
5,GANGSTER,ANYTIME I BECOME BORED WITH WHATS ON TELEVISION I POP THIS MOVIE IN. I ORGINALLY PURCHASED THE VHS. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH WHEN THE DVD BECAME AVAILABLE I PURCHASED THAT TOO.AN FBI AGENT AND A HITMAN BECOMES FRIENDS AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIVES HITS THEM WHERE IT HURTS. I AM QUITE SURE AL PACINO HAS LEARNED KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.
4,A great film that got me thinking...Can it be that easy to infiltrate the Mafia,"Just kidding, that aside, i watched this simply because of the fact that it is based on a true story. It's not more of 'a' true story but the most infamous story in American history. I noticed that 'true stories' that are diverted into films always become some of the most epic films ever seen, and sometimes it can be embarassing i.e Ed Wood and Pollock. Donnie Brasco, maybe one of the most famed and celebrated films of the late 90s was also the most brilliantly acted from the entire cast. From extras to supporting roles such as the fantastic Michael Madsen and his rendition of Sonny Black.The story is fast paced, often changing the relationship between characters and bringing out the actors out of their shells to purly shine. This is not a big review because there's not much to say but that this is truly fine work and one of the most unforgettable and controversial stories in the United States."
1,FU'GET IT!,"Donnie Brasco (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]Boring...boring...boring...Made by Hollywood bubbleheads...for Hollywood airheads...actors were sleepwalking while mumbling their sorry lines...please, I'll pay just not to watch it."
1,This is pretty much the worst movie I've ever seen,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The dialog was unbearable. I felt embarrassed for the director, actors, etc. as I watched it. I can't believe a piece of trash like this has gotten such good reviews. Aside from unrealistic plot points, idiotic characters, and ugly script, there are simple technical mistakes, including a camera flash going off during the scene when Madsen threatens to 'wack' Depp. Also there are several continuity errors through the film that made me literally cringe. Lastly, the score for the film is ridiculously overbearing through the entire film. It was as if it had been composed for some B horror flick. This is my advice, take Donnie Brasco and put it back on the shelf and find a copy of Good Fellas if you want to see a great mob film.GoodFellas"
2,wrong one,I did not realize there is such a difference in DVD's. I ordered the worng one and had to send it back.
3,A look at the inner-workings of la cosa nostra,"This film portrays a realistic look at the inner-workings of the Mafia, where respect is earned and rats are burned. I would argue that it is good that it lacks the romanticism of the Godfather, b/c that film was a fairy tale.I was refreshed by the multidimensional role of lefty (played by Pacino). You see the hard-nosed street-toughened gangster and then you see a more vulnerable side to his character."
5,"Great Movie, got even Better!","I have owned this movie in the past, but it was on VHS!This is how the movie was meant to be seen and heard! The Picture Quality is top notch, and the Uncompressed Audio track makes this Movie felt and heard!After 10 yrs the picture was awesome, my wife even commented on the clarity, which always helps justify a purchase!If you haven't seen this in awhile, get the Blu-Ray! It is well worth it!"
5,Truly A Great Movie!,This movie is such that it may be watched over and over and over again. This is one of the main reasons for buying instead of renting and this one is a gem!
4,"Come On Donnie, lets Fillet this Fat F---","An exellent movie where the undercover agent Donnie Brasco finds himself trancforming from a investigator to a real life mobster. I think that this is a different type of mobster flick because it comes from a differetn angle. It was well made and has a different feeling then most of its sister-movies. You will like Donnie Brasco if you liked A Bronx Tale, Carlito's Way, or Goodfellas."
2,Unoriginal,"Johnny Depp confuses me. Known for his esoteric choices this movie did not seem to fit with his usual fare. Rather mundane compared to other parts of his.That aside, I was not impressed with something Donnie Brasco. Nothing of this film was bad but nothing stood out. Constantly I was reminded of other movies that are better then this one.To add to my frustration, there are no extras on the DVD. Picture and sound quality are passable. Rental."
1,Donnie Fiasco,"I've heard of 3-D movies, but this one is 1-D--as in the characters are all one dimensional. Now, Depp does a good job within the limits of the script, but once again, Al Pacino is doing his Al Pacino imitation, or better said, his imitation of someone else doing an Al Pacino imitation. If this guy isn't the most overrated actor in the world, he'll do until that guy comes along. Cliche ridden, dese and dose dialogue, and a bucket of blood thrown in to keep you awake. This is one of the poorer mob movies, so make sure you give it to someone you don't love. In fact, after watching, throw the DVD in the air and shoot it repeatedly. Couldn't hurt."
4,Great Gangster movie,If you have ever thought of becoming a wise guy you have to see this movie. A great combination of a wonderful script and terrific acting by both pacino and Depp. It portrayed the dangers of vouching for the wrong guy in a colorful and entertainning way. For Mafia fans this is a must see.
5,mafiosos have hearts too,"My father was one of the men working on Sonny's crew back in the seventies before everybody got hauled in. Now he's dead, but one of his last words were, ""If you see agent Donnie, if he shows his face again, tell him that I love him and I forgive him."" As the movie portrays, it was hard for everyone in the family to not like Donnie Brasco(Joe Pistone). He should've just came forward about his identity. Something could've been worked out."
4,A true keeper,"Overlooked at the time of its release, I really hope Donnie Brasco has found its audience on video and DVD. The depth of characterization so rare in most films is abundant here, and a lot of the credit goes to both Depp and Pacino. This is a really heartbreaking, gritty drama. Its also brightened by an astounding performance by Anne Heche that shatters preconceptions. As a film, there is little wrong with it, but as a DVD, there's a lot to be desired. Such a great film deserves extras, other than just languages and a trailer. Why don't any newer films ever get extras? Its seems that they just get rushed out to the stores without much preparation. The picture is great, but I would expect no less from a modern film. Watch it for the great movie, don't get your hopes up about anything else."
3,Very Entertaining,"This is one of the more entertaining films in its genre. The teaming of Johnny Depp and Al Pacino was a brilliant stroke, and both deliver outstanding performances. Michael Madsen also gives a noteworthy performance as Sonny Black, the capo who very nearly inducted Pistone into the Bonnano crime family. Those who have read the book will notice that there are quite a few factual errors, but the film is nonetheless entertaining, and well worth buying for repeat viewing."
5,great match up cast for a gangster flick,"Al Pacino & Johnny Depp made an awesome team, there wit, charisma & tough guy attitude made the movie cant wait for the longer version to be made available for instant streaming through amazon super good movie with a good cast."
4,Great movie,"I don't usually like violent films, but this is truly a great movie based on a true story of the mob. I had to turn my head a few times, but I still like this film very much."
5,Donnie Brasco,It's a superb movie -- one of the best depicting the true picture and psyche of the mafia. Johnny Depp is oustanding and Al Pacino gives one of his best performances ever in this movie.
5,Classic,"What a combo. When this movie was made, Depp was emerging as a truly great actor, alongside the great Al Pacino. Fantastic!"
3,Stay True,"To me there were some boring parts in this movie but Johnny Depp, Pacino, and Anne Heche elevated the standards. Normally most movie don't make me feel sad but this one hit me in the heart. Specially at the end. I could feel the camaraderie between Depp and Pacino even though they were on complete extremes. The infiltration by Brasco was exciting at all times b/c you never knew when he was going to get ""wacked."" Also the intriguing part about this story is that it was a true story. That makes the characters and acting seem more real b/c it really happened. I believe that this is one of Depp's best performances that I've seen and this adds another angle to the mafia underworld. I wouldn't get this again, but I would surely see it again."
5,One of the best,Based on the true story this movie wasn't to accurate It doesn't follow the book but it has a lot of history about the mafia behind it Definetly one of the best
3,Not as good as what I've seen!,"Though Al Pacino gives a solid performance, I found the film to be blasse. It's plot was slow and teedious. The movie does have its tension filled moments. However, I found this movie to be a poor man's ""Goodfellas""."
1,A tired genre gets worse with Donnie,"The story of Donnie Brasco is one of the more compelling tales of organized crime and policing in America Ñ too bad the book was clunky, convoluted and cliche-ridden. I had high hopes for the film, but the big-screen version offers nothing new in either the gangster or cop movie genre. In fact, if you thought Michael Madsen's one-note turns in Reservoir Dogs and Frankie the Fly were spellbinding, then you're in for a treat: he's back, with the same hulking presence, complete with his trademark monosyllabic muttering. Depp is completely miscast as FBI agent Joe Pistone, and the twisting of ""facts"" in the film Ñ his strained relationship with family and feds Ñ is puzzling if you've read the book. Why critics raved about Donnie Brasco is beyond me. Spurts of blood, an uninspired '70s soundtrack and Al Pacino does not a good gangster movie make. Leave it at Goodfellas, and move on."
1,Vonage is Bad News,"Don't switch to Vonage beside poor sound quality. They have no Customer Service whatsoever. I have been trying to contact them for over a week and nothing. They do not respond to your emails, and tech support does not answer the phone. The only people you can get to answer is Sales, and they won't help you with problems. This is the worst company I've ever run across. Do yourself a favor and stick with your normal phone company or pick another VoIP provider. Vonage is Bad News!"
4,Worked right out of the box,"I had the service up and running within 5 minutes, did not need any installation other than plug and play. I was making international calls to the United Kingdom within the hour at 3 cents a minute.....Very impressive. I set it up so that it rings my cell as well as the home number so friends can find me with just one call. I gave it 4 stars only because I could not get a local area code number (Topeka KS ) and set up a 1-888 number for local friends to call in on."
1,Poor quality service - don't use Vonage,"Low sound quality, difficult to reach customer support, and frequent service outages. Even though my cable internet connection is very good, the vonage service is mediocre at best. In 3 months of using the service, I have had at least 5 days of no vonage service, and many have reported that when they call me they can't get through."
2,Don't use it as router,"This devise is ok when use strictly as vonage adapter. However, if used as a router AND vonage adapter, the quality of the call goes all the way gradually down until the router gets frozen and loses connection.If you download large files and/or try to watch a movie and speak on the phone at the same time, this devise will drop connection and will need to be restarted. That's my experience anyway.I needed up replacing it with other vonage adapter and selling this on CL for a couple of dollars.Overall, what a piece of junk."
2,Drops,I've had the box for about a year. Over time it seems to drop calls. I plug my PS3 into it and it will drop off my game server consistently. I attached a DLINK and everything works fine. Software upgrades did not help. Vonage should look for a better system.
2,"Started strong, then Vonage took over.","I bought this router to support my Vonage phone, like most people. The sound quality wasn't too bad and it was fairly stable. However, in the coming months, Vonage took over the router and automatically pushed updates to the router. The current version I have constantly restarts the router at random intervals. It's quite an inconvenience when I'm on the phone for work and am constantly disconnected. I logged in to flash the firmware, and since Vonage took over, it will not allow you without making some of your own work-around modifications.I'm not pleased that I can't do what I want with my router in regards to updating the firmware.When I find a much better option, I would go for it."
1,Do not buy this router for Vonage service,"We paid a little extra for this router for the integrated Vonage phone jacks included in the package. Boy, were we disappointed. We stopped using the Vonage service within a couple weeks because voice packets were dropped when multitasking with web-related activities. Refresh a webpage - dropped voice packets... check for email - dropped voice packets.Do not buy this router for Vonage services. If you care about quality phone service and you're online throughout the day, do not use Vonage."
3,Beware of buying previously owned Vonage routers,"Currently, you want to buy only a new unit. Vonage will not authorize for phone service any previously owned equipment used on the Vonage VOIP. I am a Vonage user and thought it would be nice to have this wireless router along with the VOIP. I bought a WRT54GP2 that was used for only 3 months by a former Vonage customer. The wireless router worked fine. When I went to have the MAC re-authorized for my use, Vonage refused to do it. I was directed and re-directed to at least 4 different departments within Vonage and each said they could not activate this unit for Vonage usage because it was previously owned.Here is a website (Vonage Forum) where others have had a similar problem.http://www.vonage-forum.com/ftopic4349.htmlThe Linksys part of this unit works beautifully and you could still buy a used WRT54GP2 for that purpose."
1,"$50 is all its worth, if even that","I got this router from Best Buy when I decided to move my phone to Vonage. I have had nothing but trouble from day one. First, the phone service even sucked but some constant tweaking of the settings over a couple of weeks straightened that out. Now it works great, except for the wireless.The wireless connection sucks. It constantly drops out, resets the connections, and runs very slow. I have to unplug the router at least twice per day just to use the wireless connection.Finally, I managed to fix it and get it working right: I bought a new wireless router and turned off the Linksys' wireless for good. So, if you want a hardwired router with a crappy wireless addition, buy this."
5,W. P. Kinsella's best baseball book,This book reveals the depth of character that can be attained simply by being a baseball fan
2,Very Disappointed,"I just finished my sophomore year of college. I have had the Iowa Baseball Confederacy in my room forever but I waited until the semester was over to start reading it because I wanted to give it full attention. I read Shoeless Joe a couple of years ago and it is still my all-time favorite book. I went into this one with high expectations. However, they were not met. I just didn't like the characters, didn't care about them. The Plot seemed like a bunch of short stories together that made no sense.Magic is a key element in Kinsella stories. However, this one just seemed too fantastic. I don't know how players coming back from the dead in Shoeless Joe seemed more realistic than the time-travel, magic Indian, and the obsession with the game in the Iowa Baseball Confederacy, but it just does.The book is worth a read if you're a Kinsella Fan but don't waste your time otherwise. Read Shoeless Joe again."
1,What a bore,"As an avid baseball fan, I was anxious to read Kinsella's novel. What a mistake. I normally finish every book I start. The Iowa Baseball Confederacy is an exception. I got to page 125 and put the book down, never to be picked back up again. For those of you who enjoyed it I am glad for you. This book would never be on my must read list. One star for this book was too many for me."
4,The magic of baseball in the midwest,"You don't have to be a Cubs fan to love The Iowa Baseball Confederacy...but it helps. Kinsella has hit another home run with this magical tale of time travel and baseball in the midwest. I find his writing similar to that of Jack Finney in that he pursuades his readers that the most impossible things might actually happen, especially the things you dream most about. Suspend your disbelief, imagine the past, and step into it."
5,One of the best american novels,"Its pretty difficult to put this book in a genre. Sports novel? There's a 2,000 inning game in here. Mythology? The characters seem plenty real to me. Lets just say that it belongs in the genre of books that defy classification.I'm not sure whats so great about this book. I guess its just the fact that when Kinsella says there was this totally fantastic event, you believe him. Who knows why? The man is an amazing writer, and this proves it. By the way, if you are a teacher by all means, assign this book to your class instead of the tired old 19th century british class warfare novel."
5,"Excellent novel, what else would you expect from Kinsella?","After reading ""Shoeless Joe"" my craving for W.P. Kinsella needed to be taken care of. When I picked up ""The Iowa Baseball Confederacies"" I did not expect to read it entirely in one day. But Kinsella has that kind of effect on a reader. He intertwines fiction with fact, reality with fantasy. He develops characters so well that you feel their pain when things don't go their way, and you share in their joy when things do. The story of Gideon Clarke and his obsession is a page turner for anyone who enjoys fantasy novels, and a healthy knowledge of baseball wouldn't hurt early. His use of the greatest double play tandem in baseball history, Tinkers-Evers-Chance, lets the reader associate reality with Kinsella's fantasy world. The story of the Iowa Baseball Confederacy and their 40 day baseball game versus the eventual World Champion Cubs of 1908 is a book I strongly reccommend"
4,Very handy for planning and during the travel,"I generally prefer Michelin guides for planning travel because they are loaded with background stories about the points of interest. The three-star rating system is kind of handy too, although sometimes I don't agree with the rating Michelin gives, which is totally understandable.One thing I found very helpful during my travel in Greece was that Michelin always has the sites of interest listed in the native language as well as in English. I barely knew how to say ""thank you"" in Greek (efharisto), so I wasn't sure I could get around despite I was told Greeks are better English speakers in general. The world is not created for English speakers in mind, so there are times that the information is only available in the native language. At least being able to find out which way to go to get to the site I know better was such a relief."
4,One of the best,"I would like to recommend this guide to people that would like to visit Greece. Originally I am from Greece and several times I've been asked to make some suggestion to friends about what travel guides to use. I've done some research on bookstores and I think this guide is well written very concise and covers the most important places. I think the writers must have really travelled a lot around Greece because they recommend places, like my hometown, that are not very well known but they offer some very important sights of interest. I have also learned things I didn't know before. In the past I had bought a similar guide for New England and I was very satisfied. I gave 4 stars rather than 5 because there can be some improvements in the greek spelling and in covering more recent historical facts. It's a guide you can enjoy reading from begining to end."
4,Good stuff!,"Highlighted by a smart script, a playful sense of humor and a solid rapport between the leads!"
5,"An indispensable book for students, professionals and laymen alike","This book has everything a person could want and then some. It has conditions, diseases, injuries, tests, health, anatomy, ect. Everything listed in here is described in the simplest detail that any adult can understand.There are an ample amount of color photographs and drawings throughout. WARNING - A few photographs may be a bit much for some people to handle. Some diseases and conditions can look downright disgusting to more sensitive readers.It is thumb tabbed for easy navigation throughout the alphabet. That makes for a great time saver and ease of use as well.This book is a tremendous resource for nursing school. Even if it is not required, I fully recommend it's purchase."
5,Best support you could ever buy!,"I bought this Dictionary for my daughter who is studying Nursing and she just told me THANKS MOM because this book will lead me to a better way of understanding terms and subjets that with out it will be impossible.This dictionary is like the ""Mother of books"" to everyone who will want to be more prepared for the professional nursing enviroment.Thanks to Amazon too for having this type of tools available to anyone!"
1,What for?,"I was intrigued by the description of the story and the character and ordered the book.What for?I thought there would be some interesting description of his time in the OSS, of the mysterious and fascinating Jim Thompson.Maybe he was all that, but this book was not. He started a silk business in Thailand, and built a house gave dinner parties and collected oriental art.then one day he went out for a walk and dissapeared. And no one knows what happened.there you go you just read the book.on and on about people trying to solve the mystery of what happened to him, seers, detectives, with doctors and on and on..so what?I immediately gave the book away to someone..to see if he was as dissapointed in it as I was.Havent felt this way about a book in a long time"
5,This book got me out onto the porch!,"This delightful book appears to be a trip to the past, but on me its effects are in the present: It's driven me right out to the porch for listening to the first spring insects and it's got me examining the scores of porch pictures for architectural ideas. A great variety of poetry, essays, reminiscences, interviews, plays, stories, and pictures--and handsomely bound.The first review here is from someone living in the same county as many of the authors. I don't live there and am enjoying it as much, so I think the contents are of more than local interest.I'm buying more for gifts."
4,something I forgot,"Another bad thing about Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters The Movie, volumes 1 and 2, is that for the whole thing, Yugi (as in little cute bug-eyed Yugi-chan) is a freaking WHINER-BOX! His voice is all high and abnormally squeaky, and at first it was cute, but GOL-LY! I think Dan Green probably reached his limit on how high his voice could go. Anyhow, that's it. Enjoy the movies! Elissachan has spoken."
4,"12"" Barbie Bike","My 2 year old daughter LOVEs this bike - esp the radio feature! It was relatively easy to put togther as well, so don't let that deter you!!!!"
3,Could have been better.,"With the vast and glorious difference we where presented between DW3 and DW4, I was expecting the same jump in presence. Regrettably, with the exceptions of appearance, no major changes."
4,An improvement-but,"If you have played any of the old games, you know what to expect. This one is an improvement on almost all aspects...I only with you had bodyguards still..and a bow.but it is fun; for both die hard fans and newcomers :)not a full utilization of my PS3 and HDTV tho..."
2,Dynasty REPEAT,"DW. 2, 3, 4, all great. But this is the same hack n' slash gameplay we've seen! I'm sick of this game! I could buy DW 4 and save some damned money!!! I'll leave it at this. It's like watching the same movie over and over and over and over and over and over and over again! The camera angles sometime get annoying. If your a DW fan, pick it up, otherwise, this game isn't going to turn you into one."
2,BORING!!!,"Ive never been a big fan of dynasty warriors. But this game is just bad. First off on easy mode you can defat an entire army by yourself. This is because the enemys never attack. once i ran into the center of a group of enemys and i stood still. I didn't get attacked for ten minutes. Also all of the soldgers look identical. there are about three enemys that dont look the same.and there are only 4 hard fights in the entire game. Also THIS GAME IS REPETTATIVE. you have 6 attacks per character but they all do the exact same thing. And one hit kills petty much all enemys. Now this game is long but so what. If you have a huge pile of garbage, is it really any better then a small pile of garbage. and either way it is still garbage. just like this game."
1,better off with word or less expensive printmaster,"I've been creating invitations out of my home for a couple of years. I upgraded to printingpress extreme and am very disappointed.The graphics are very limited and so are the fonts. The customer service is fair and they really want you to buy the $1,000 pro software, which is a stretch. I think that after using printmaster and even word, that you can do very similar work without spending what printing press software costs."
1,Printing Press Wedding Software,A complete waste of money.Not user friendly. Very limited package.Very dissapointed.
3,"good Idea, not enough time","I got this thinking I would save time and money for my wedding, but I guess i was in to much of a hurry to figure how to set this up right. I had trouble matching it with my computer an printer and gave up early. I am sure I will attempt to use this again for another occasion when I have a bigger time line."
2,Not so good,"I got directly from Zoya. It does not seem to be good for my nails. Since I started using it my nails have been splitting and flaking. So, I won't be using it anymore."
3,Spiritual Miracles Stories,"""Children of the Second Birth: Being a Narrative of Spiritual Miracles in a City Parish"" by SM Shoemaker Jr has been republished by Tuchy Palmieri funded by Healing-Habits.com. This is another book about personal lives that were changed by finding Christ after struggling with temptations and making bad choices in their lives. It shows that the way to change your life is to start by again believing in Christ and slowly changing what you have been accustomed to doing to a more positive and rewarding way. Though you may have draw backs, you must continue to believe in yourself and in Christ in order to have a second birth. Again each story has a religious tone to it but are short and easy to read.Although it was an inspiring book it was one that I could put down and read later. It did not keep my attention to the point that I had to read it all at once. But it was worth the read."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS...,"if you are a Mariah collector or long time fan. I did and I am really MAD. The listing makes it look like this is the actual SINGLE that Mariah released. It is not. It is a re-release of some of her best songs under the title: Platinum Hits with just a picture of the album cover. Not the original single at all! Just a re-release by Sony of songs they still own the rights to in an effort to sqeeze more money out of Mariah's fans without offering anything new, or anything collectible.And Amazon's this listing does not show a picture, nor does it indicate that this is NOT the single, nor that it is a re-release. What a waste of my shipping cost!"
2,good product but voltage makes difference,So i bought this gun for work on farm machinery and found that it does not preform as well as with the 14 and 18 volt models. puts out less than half the amount of grease than the 18 volt. i greased one hub with the 12 volt in the same time an 18 volt greased 3 on the low setting. 12 volt does not have the high low selection.
4,Great for students,My son has just entered high school and loves this book. I has really helped him become more interested in school. He really likes the quick and easy synopis it provides.
4,Fun for everyone,My 9 month old loves watching the car drive down our hallway. It makes some great noise and the car shakes like it’s got a massive engine under the hood. Very entertaining for both of us and has held up well after a few drops.
2,Too loud!,"This toy is in desperate need of a quieter setting. It took me a couple of days to put the batteries in it, and during that time my son loved playing with it. Once I installed the batteries and turned it on though, the sound the car made was so loud and startling that my 13M old son cried. He now plays with this much less, and never with the sounds on."
5,years of fun,"My daughter got this as a gift over 5 years ago and it has been played with hard by her and now her brother it takes a beating and is very fun. This is something that is still out even though all the other little kids toys are packed away. The car skids off down the hallway and then stops and giggles, they love it."
4,Customer service makes up for the arm rest.,"My armrest broke as well. Of Course I never had any other problem out of the chair besides some squeaking... The Squeaks were fixed with a little lithium Grease. The Armrest made me think I would need to buy a whole new chair. I called the 800 # on the instruction card that came with my chair.. I presed '2' for Customer assistance. The lady that answered, seemed nice, she took my phone number, address and after asking what model chair I had. She sent me out a brand new arm rest for free.. Yes it is under warranty, but I expected more of a hassle. Thanks for the new Arm Rest. and if anyone needs the number it is 800-637-0005"
5,Powerful motor,I love these clippers. The motor is powerful and the adjustment in the head eliminates the need for attachments for the shorter haircuts. These clippers have lasted me several years and appear to have a long life. Cheaper clippers are not worth purchasing.
5,Perfect clippers,"Right, so the only gripe that people have with these clippers is that they are heavy. Seriously, you people need to start picking up something heavier than the TV remote.That heavy duty motor is exactly what i was looking for. These clippers also have the lever on the side that give you a good bit of adjustment between combs. TheAndis Magnetic Guide Comb Setmake it really easy to switch combs.If you have ever owned any of the Chinese made Wahl garbage clippers, it will make these a pleasure to use."
2,Make sure you know what you are getting,My issue with this item is how poorly it was packaged. The box that it was shipped in looked like it had been opened and looked kind of scruffy. My husband and i opened the box and the actual box the product comes in was opened. It did not look brand new like it was supposed to be. The oil included with it had been opened prior to us getting it. I got them for my husband because he likes being bald and unfortunatly they don't cut low enough. So if you are looking to go bald these are not the clippers for you.
5,Andies Fade Master is wonderful!,"Just wanted to express that the package was nicley shipped, and in one piece. My level of experiance of cutting hair is very limited but by using the Master the first time my fade looked professionally done, and recievd alot of compliments.Andis 01557 Improved Master Professional ClipperI highley reccommend this product. Best on fades by far!!"
4,An excellent job,"Once again, Mireille Mathiue has done an excellent job, in the German version of her tribute to Edith Piaf. Even if the idea of Mimi Mathieu doing a tribute to Edith Piaf is as absurd as The Beatles doing a tribute to The Byrds, this cd is worth the money."
4,Chante Piaf In German...,"It wasn't a surprise that Mme Mathieu would re-record ""Chante Piaf"" in German. Many attacked the idea that the songs would lose their charm if translated and performed in an other language, but the record proves that the spark is still in them. ""Jezebel"", ""Mon Dieu"" & ""Padam Padam"" sound more dramatic here. The Parisien Piaf feeling is all around...The orchestrations are still the same, but there are 2 tracks missing here.Recommended."
3,Vegan assessment,"The book has some ideas and information we didn't have. It is a good buy for the content. As for vegans, your going to have a hard time finding anything anywhere that will help in locating new recipt,"
1,this is a WIEGHT LOSS book NOT a vegi book,"This book is not a vegetarian cook book it is a weight loss book that takes great dishes and then removes all the fat and spice until they taste like low sodium card board. Diana Shaw authors this book as one of those naive middle aged ladies who assumes if you are a vegetarian you are on a weight loss diet. Her refusal to use the words cream, cheese (other then cottage) and butter, other than to scold the use of these ingredients, and her annoying placement of ""nonfat"" in front of the word yogurt made me draw a habit and a ruler over her book jacket photo. The only 2 reasons you should buy this book are A) to deprive yourself of real food in an effort to lose weight or B) to avoid having to buy spices, because she uses close to none. If you want a good veggie cookbook stick to the Moosewood series or Madhur Jaffrey or any thing other than this book."
2,Essential,"This may be a very essential book for hard core cooks who have a lot of money to buy the grocery's needed. I read it and made one recipe from it. The book has been sitting on my shelf ever sence. There are many other, books out there that are better then this one."
3,It's been donated ...,"Pretty thorough info on a variety of grains/vegetables; however, I completely agree with earlier reviewers. Some major recipe omissions in the soybean category, frugal with spices, and really opinionated -- e.g., she ruthlessly ""disses"" Quinoa, which is very nutritious and, in my opinion and that of many others, tastes great.Is it my imagination, or are the recipes predominantly Western European?"
4,Roscoe - Young Roscoe Philaphornia,"Roscoe is a good performer. I like his style, but not all his records. This album is definitely his great work. Whole album. You'll not regard your investigation."
5,good for a west coast rapper.........,dang da west coast is provin 2 me tht the are just as good as east. this guy aint as good as kurupt acually they the same. i give it 5 stars becuase it cant get any better than this go cop it now . the best songs are every single song. holla
5,Roscoe: A Superstar,"Almost a year ago (August 2002) I saw Kurupt in concert. Roscoe (his little brother) happened to be there, and I fell in love with him there. I blew him a kiss, he returned one...I said I love you Roscoe, he said it back. It was an amazing night. I have been waiting since October 2002 for his CD to come out, and I can definetely say that it was worth the wait. This CD is one of the best that I have ever heard. You can listen to this CD non-stop because every song is just as good as the others. I would suggest this CD for anyone who has interest in West Coast Rap, or any rap/hip-hop. 5 STARS!!!"
5,simply amazing...,"Allright. Ghosts right? Not me, no way. There is no reason why any of us should belive in ghosts right? Wrong. In this book by Ms. Word, you do belive. The reason you do is because this book is REAL. There are no made up stories and like Ms. Word said, all stories she has recorded have been told by the good ol' folks of south Louisiana. I had the good fortune for Ms. Word to visit my elementary school when I lived in So. Louisiana and I was one of the few who bought a copy and had her sign it. Almost 8 years later, I still have this book and as I go through college, these stories still have a firm place in my mind. Even though I no longer live in Louisiana, I can still go back with her book."
4,I would welcome a part 2 - A guide to how Jews who become less observant and their more observant relatives can still get along,I would welcome a part 2 - A guide to how Jews who become less observant and their more observant relatives can still get along.In her book '2 Jews can still be an Intermarriage' Azriela Jaffe offers practical solutions when an Observant Jew tries to make a life with a non or less Observant Jew. This book address the journey one faces when becoming more observant. What about the challenges one faces when they become less observant? How does an observant Jew explain to their family and friends the compromises they might make? A book that deals with those difficult issues would be most welcome.
4,"Pretty good, in fact very good","Ok, I own the first three albums and love them. This album is more of the same, with a few suprises thrown in. ""Treat her like a lady"" is a great new song for them. Push Me Away, Conscience, Best Friend, and Liberty are also highlights of the album. There really isn't a track to skip over on the entire album. Go pick it up soon so these guys can get a well-deserved record contract with a major label."
3,Where is episode California Here Dog Comes? It was season 3 episode 1.,"My favorite episode of all time, no where to be found, They go to San Francisco for Samu Sevea, this was an hour episode. by far my favorite.Wasn't on the best of DVD, it was episode 1 of season 3."
4,Anyone else having problems?,"The show is great! I would give it 5 stars, but does anyone else's DVD's seem to have the pictures moving a lot faster than the sound? Like you can see their lips moving but the words catch up like a second later? Im not sure if its just mine and its kind of annoying if its all you can focus on!?"
4,I love this show!,"Season five is good. I am a big fan of the show and own all of the seasons and watch ALL of them over and over. It's my bed time ritural to watch at least an episode or two or the whole dvd. I love this series,so if you are a fan like I am fan than you will enjoy Season 5!"
1,No subtitles!,"The videos have no subtitles, and the audio is horrible. The other DVDs I bought before had subtitles, and the audio was ok."
5,season 5 that 70's,"like all the 70's shows, i love them all. they make you laugh, hasnt made me cry yet, but im not through the seasons yet and it discuss's important issues as well...they still turn out to be funny, but if youre in a sour mood and need to laugh, this is great."
5,A funny season,This is one of the best seasons next to season three. I love Kitty when she has menopause she is so funny. Fez has sex at last and Jackie begins dating Hyde. Laurie returns and marries Fez. Donna and Eric get back together and get engaged. A really funny season and a great show.
4,Groovy!,"My boyfriend is a huge fan of this show, so of course this is what I gave him for his birthday. He loved it!"
1,Dont Judge By Its COVER,"The picture and the real product DOES NOT MATCH... I found it very disappointing when it wasn't my first time and I learned my lesson. I had to do more work by asking each seller to see if this product has the older design with bigger cardboard box set with 4 slimmer plastic case, because it is what I want. I don't really want the only one newer, slimmer, and plastic DVD case that are recently made. It will not match with my older collection... Other than that, I m pretty sure that this product contains very same TV show and everything but not for me. Thanks."
3,First seasons were the best,We have all the DVD's up to and including season 5. The first couple of seasons were the very best ones. We love them all. Keep them coming.
1,I'm glad it was free. I wouldn't have paid for it,"This book is not very compelling. There are a lot of assumptions and stereotypes that have nothing to do with real life.If your view of the world is from the extreme right (politically) then you should love this book. It validates most of what you believe about the rest of the USA.If your view of the world is tempered with logic and knowledge, you will probably find this book dull, when it is being not being funny (although I don't think that the writer intended those parts to be funny), and seems to have a very twisted view of the Law and Constitution."
3,Christmas controversy,About November I start looking for books set at Christmas time to start reading. I was thrilled to see this book by Randy Singer as a free Kindle download and anxiously started to read it.I so wanted to like this book and it does have good parts. But the legal drama seemed to just go on and on and on. A good portion of the book was spent on a girls basketball team and I'm just not interested in basketball so that was a drawback for me. I do enjoy books revolving around the legal system but this just seemed like it was repeating the same thing over and over.The end of the book was very good. A couple of good twists that were rather unexpected and very pleasant ended the book on an up note.
1,Trite.,"It's really a sad simplistic book with very shallow one dimensional characters and a very silly plot. Save the photons of light for something else this book is simply not worth the read, even if it's free."
2,Definitely a Two Star,"This was a Kindle freebie. It's a rather odd story and one of the main characters, who is standing up for his beliefs, (at the expense of his family) is pretty unlikable; for what he's doing now and for the past. One of their children died because they prayed instead of getting medical help for him. The judge also is a contradiction and there is really not a lot to it.Not exactly a waste of time, but I don't think I'll read anything else by the author."
3,OK,"The book was OK. Not a ""couldn't put the book down"" kind of book, but good. Would have liked more depth to each character."
4,Good book but not Great!,"I like all of Randy Singer's books and this was a nice an easy read, however, it did not have the drama that most of his books have. But I would still recommend it as an enjoyable book."
3,Interesting story but the end was weak,"After reading ""The Justice Game"" I couldn't wait to read another Randy Singer book. This one was intriguing but when I got to the end I was surprised that there wasn't any more. It left a lot of questions unanswered. Still a good read though."
5,A comprehensive guide to the ad industry,"An excellent guide to the industry and its various roles. Straight forward, telling it 'as it is' with great tips for getting that job. Also contains valid quotes from people 'in the business'. Wish something like this had been around 20 years ago!"
5,EXCELLENT TRANSACTION,"Excellent transaction; BOOK IS IN GREAT SHAPE, CLEAN, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY FM THIS SELLER AGAIN."
3,The Massive was decent.,"While many of the fights were good (especially the final showdown), a lot of the fighting took place just off the screen so that it was often hard to determine what was going on. Aside from that the plot was good. The characters were interesting to say the least. All in all it was another decent kung fu movie. It was not poor by any means, but not excellent either."
4,"This is the movie ""Murder of Murders"" - English edition.","This is the same movie as "" Murder of Murders "". The original Chinese title of the movie is "" The Jade Dragonfly "". Story is about six stolen jems by the famous ""Jade Dragonfly"". The police head who was conducting the search turns out to be the one who stole the six jems from the Jade Dragonfly. Good story and an interesting movie."
5,A rare gem!!,"Got this book used as it is out of print. It is a must for Goju Ryu practitioners. THe fact that it was written by Seikichi Toguchi, a Goju Ryu legend should be enough, but the book contains so much great information that it should be a staple of any serious practitioner's library."
3,Good Basic Techniques,This is a good book for basic Goju techniques. If could have had more on kata.
2,NEI-Not Enough Information,"My sis and I got lost at the end. We thought maybe we hadn't listened close enough. Since reading the other 7 point review we see that it was not us who missed the point. It was the movie maker. Also, there was too much hanky panky going on. Even if the ""father"" was the bad guy."
5,Chilton Manual,"THe manual is a complete manual covering the engine of the Lexus that I own. Unfortunately , chilton did not include the accessories which are covered in the other manuals from Lexus. I was hoping to be able to fix some of the accessories but and glad to have the manual anyway.It is in good condition and was shipped promptly."
2,Unreal,Where is the disturbed song from stone cold entrance. Total let down. HHH's song from motorhead came out way after disturbed. This is a sad day!
3,"okay, but pie is overhyped and it dont have austin's music","tazz, kane, raven, and benoit are pretty good, but the best is The Game; by motorhead. Lita and eddy guerrero are bombs but pie is the worst song on there, they should have Stone Cold Steve Austin's song by Disturbed in it's place. it is an okay cd, so if you like wwf and enjoyed previous ""wwf: the music"" cd's then this is worth buying"
5,great cd,"this has to be the best wwf cd ever. triple h's(the game)and benoit's(shooter) are the best on the cd. one song that i could have done without was the song was pie by the rock. all i can say is, what hell is up with it. i would rather have had stone cold version with disturbed. it is still a good pickup"
2,This CD Super Sucks,"I couldn't wait for this CD to come out. I was practically chewing at the bit. I have never been so disapointed in my life. The only songs that are actually worth listening to are triple H's song and Chyna's. That is IT!!! The fourth one is better than this one. Even the Rock's song on this CD is rediculously stupid, and I have a great sence of humar. I thought is was absolutely a wast of my money. I am a VERY VERY big WWF fan. But, man I couldn't believe that this CD would be so bad."
3,Too much missing..,"The roster of themes on the fifth edition of the WWF: The Music series seems to be overshadowed by the roster of themes that have been left out. The biggest one would be Stone Cold Steve Austin's theme by Disturbed. By leaving the best theme in wrestling out, it gives you second thoughts about the content on the actual cd - and rightfully so. Chyna, Too Cool, Billy Gunn and a few others are not worth listening to twice. Where is the Dudley, Hardy, Radicalz, Malenko themes? On a positive note, Triple H's theme is the best track on the CD and may be the best theme in wrestling today. I love it, and the same goes for Tazz, Benoit, and Angle. Get this CD is you like wrestling themes, but if you're looking for the best the WWF has to offer, this isn't it."
4,It feels so right,"Overall this CD was pretty cool, but I still think the Hardy's theme song should be on there. Lita's was probably the best but I really want to know who sings those whispery lyrics. Chyna's music was okay but could have been better. Chris Benoit's music had a cool beat to it and so did Tazz's. ""Pie"" could have been a little better but was pretty funny anyway. ""Turn It Up"" was a great dance track if you like techno-remixed songs. Definatly a must have for any WWF fan."
2,MOTORHEAD SAVE THE CD AND ARE THE SELLING POINT FOR IT,"This is Volume 5 in the World Wrestling Federation The Music series issued by Smack Down/Koch. Why am I bothering to even review this release? Only because Motorhead are featured performing the opening track a new song titled ""The Game"" which Lemmy is joined by Triple H singing on it. This song will be welcomed by Motorheadbangers fan's with no problem only because it is Motorhead. Slick Rick also does a guest performance on ""Pie"" with the lead singer The Rock. Other than that, unless you collect Wrestling or novelty stuff this CD is not for you. BTW: This CD is an enhanced CD PC version only."
3,the Game by Motorhead,"well at least triple H has enouth sense to like Motorhead and their song is probably the best on this album, but when Motorhead fans who are not WWF fans want to listen to the song what do they do? go to www.imotorhead.com, only WWF didn't like the fact that Motorhead were giving away a Motorhead song which motorhead fans wouldn't buy anyway, WWF fans will buy the compilation anyway even if they had already downloaded the Game. but because all WWF care about is money, the song had to be removed from the web site, Capitalist pigs!!!"
2,Terrible! Just terrible!,"This album was terrible! The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because the only songs worth hearing is Triple H's theme ""The Game"" by Motorhead, and Rikishi's theme ""Bad Man"". Too Cool's theme makes great dancing music. But the rest of the songs on this album were a letdown! Don't waste your money. For those of us in reality, this CD needs to remain on the shelf. Period."
4,Should've Been Called Best of the WWF,"This was probably the best WWF soundtrack to date. I've listened to Volumes 2, 3, 4, & 5 and I can honestly say this one is the best. My favorite song on here is ""It Just Feels Right"" - Lita. The beats on this song totally rock, although I wish the talking part at the beginning would've been cut out like it is on WWF shows. Also, ""The Game"" by Motorhead - Triple H is one of the best. Probably the weakest were ""Rowdy"" - K-Kwik, ""What About Me?"" - Raven, and ""Bad Man"" - Rikishi. ""Who I Am"" - Chyna is a great song that's just fun to listen to. ""Turn It Up"" - Too Cool is an awesome song with great dance music. ""Shooter"" - Chris Benoit is probably the third best song. It's kinda like Lita's with great beats. ""Pie"" is a good song if you're a Rock fan. Either way, if you're a WWF fan you'll love this music. It's great!"
3,---,"Ok CD. Although it didn't live up to the last 2 albums, it was still pretty good.The songs that were really good were HHHs and Kanes. Lita's and Chris Benoits are alright. Chyna's and The Rock's Pie weren't too good. Chynas is VERY VERY repetitive and it gets old QUICK! Pie is only good for fans of The Rock who want a good laugh. I also didn't like Rikishi's and K-Kwik's, because both are bland rap. Overall, the CD was OK."
2,Body Slam,"Personally, I give it two stars because there are only two songs on it that I actually like. Those two songs are ""The Game"" by Motorhead (Triple H) and Out Of The Fire (Kane). After those two songs, this album experiences a severe drop off because most of the songs recycle themselves, although Rikishi's theme ""Bad Man"" and The Rock's ""Pie"" are decent, they don't spark that blood curling, adrenaline pumping, berzerker rage that Triple H and Kane's songs do."
2,WWFailure,"Alright, now I'm a HUGE WWF fan. I really am. After Volumes 3 & 4 I thought we were gonna see a blockbuster here from the WWF Music Team. Ohhh man was I wrong. Like the last album, Triple H's theme is above and beyond the other themes on the CD. SOO many important themes were left off of this CD! Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Dudley Boyz, Undertaker, hell they didn't even add on the Hardy Boyz' theme, which I feel is honestly the best theme music in the WWF today (Well, ok, next to Triple H's). Being a WWF fan, of course I was suckered into buying this, but from now on the WWF logo isn't going to be as persuasive in my eyes as it has been in the past."
3,Good story - little success for me,"The author was able to use these techniques to gain vision in his eyes, but his recommendations are not practical for most people. If you add up the time for all of the daily exercises, it is nearly 9 hours a day."
2,Not what I expected,"Not the best quality....after I washed it (on the gentle cycle), the little legs on the side got messed up, the wires moved, and the one antenna on the hat was hanging on by a thread - it wouldn't stand up like it was supposed to. I got my son's pictures done in it, and couldn't pick certain ones because the costume looked funny. Plus, the hat was a little too big for his head (he does not have a small head) Don't waste your money."
3,It's alright...,"...but I think it could be more realistic. This costume might be good enough for some, but it doesn't quite cut it if you really want your baby to look like a lobster."
3,PINK!!,"We bought this for our son. When it came in, we discovered that it is very pink. Not good for a boy at all. The quality was normal costume quality, not great, but not bad."
5,Too cute!!,"My son was absolutely adorable in this! I guess it's a halloween costume so it is made well enough to serve it's purpose, not for everyday use. I dressed my daughter as a chef (Daddy is a chef) so it was the perfect duo. They were so cute, it almost brought tears to Grandma's eyes, she couldn't stop giggling! Adorable costume!"
4,Great costume!,We loved seing our little one in this! He looked adorable!It's good quality and easy to put on. You do need to get something for underneath as this is only the shell.
1,BAD CABLE - Don't waste your $$,"I bought one of these cables and it did not work so I contacted the company and they were very responsive and sent me another. The next one was also bad. It took us taking our computer, converter for the computer and the cable to the Apple Store to discover this - we couldn't believe 2 bad cables in a row! I guess you get what you pay for, so pay for something more expensive and hopefully it will work!"
4,"Not a bucket, it's a bag :-)","Even though the pic is a bucket, it is definitely a bag when it arrives. Good salt mix, have used this one for years, now living in an area where we are far away from any pet stores that have marine supplies. Glad to find Amazon has this product. Bag is resealable, and pretty sturdy so recommend this product. Was hoping that even though the title said mix bag, that the bag would come in a small bucket, but not so, lol!"
3,Old black and white footage,"This may be interesting to people compiling a history of dance, but I was disappointed in the old black and white poor quality film, the sets and camerawork. It was an expensive lesson."
5,Sweet,"Sweet, mellow tunes and lyrics. Mostly acoustic guitar. Lara has a very soft voice that's easy on the ears. Similar to ""Innocence Mission"". There's nothing on the album that I can't stand, and most of it is very likeable. Great for relaxing to."
2,Only if you have to,"I had to have this book for a class I took. I found it difficult to track. If you must buy it, look for it used."
5,Nice pad!,"Just the right amount of friction for the mouse - not too much like some that make the mouse stick - very smooth to the touch, but not so slippery as to let the mouse roll uncontrolled. The surface is soft but not cushy - not too soft or too slick. The backing does a great job of holding this pad in place also. The pad is much better than any others I've ever had and for a great price! Thanks, Allsop!"
5,Great basic mouse pad,Made from quality material. Doesn't move around the desk. Does everything a mouse pad should.Worth the price.
5,Great Mouse Pad,"Great mouse pad for a great deal. Really is non skid, can't make it slide even if you tried (without actually grabbing it). My optical mouse works flawlessly on this mouse pad, as opposed to some trouble with my older one, and it's nice and thin. Overall, great purchase."
4,Mouse pad,Pad does what i need it to do and is made of good quality material. I have had no problems with it.
5,tastes just like at the fair,"This cotton candy tastes great, just like at the fair. I like the pink and the blue. Great for kids and adults!"
3,Refill Cotton candy,"This was fine. But disappointed in the candy maker itself. Takes forever to make a decent size cotton candy, if you get to close to heating element it gets all gunked and has to be cleaned. I don't recomend the candy maker."
3,Cotton Candy,The candy machine only makes one candy cone at a time of cotton candy then you have to wash it with very hot water to get any left over sugar out of it.. if you dont it is unbalanced and makes a lot of noise and can ruin the machine..and warp it..
3,Good starter for a small cotton candy machine,"For under $10 I think this product is OK. You get some paper cones (which I've personally never used) and enough cotton candy mix (two flavors) to last a long time. I got this instead of buying two more expensive boxes of floss. Although I would get way more sugar buying bulk, it would take forever to use that much mix with the cotton candy machine I have.I actually got 2 of these refill boxes and in one of them I was shorted one 4oz package. It should come with 2, 4oz packages of each flavor, giving you 8oz of each flavor. Just a packaging mistake I guess..."
3,You get what you pay for,The candy was great! but the machine... I gave it away as a prize cause we didn't want it
5,Great Double DVD Set,Neon is fabulous!!! Mesmerizing to watch and has much to offer in herteaching. Noone can learn everything all at once but the great thing aboutthis set is that you can view it as many times over as you like. Just keepwatching Neon and practicing!! Im a beginner and it takes years to learnthese skills but Neon has been very enlightening.
3,Instant?,I take a egyptian belly dance class and thought this DVD would be good between classes. For myself there was not enough time spent on individual move before working it into other moves.
3,Instant Bellydancer 2-dvd Set,I didn't like this dvd very much. It's not very well followable for absolute beginners and boring if you already had a few bellydance lessons. I found Neon's voice a bit annoying... Maybe others can enjoy it but definitely not my favourite.
4,not as good as the films,"this is no way as good as the 3 excellent films, but hey its still good and occasionally funny. bye"
4,Awesome bike for short trip but having little issue,"I just received my mobiky from Amazon and I love it. Since, it is really cold in New York, I can't really test it in the park yet with higher speed, but even in relatively slow speed. The front disc brake is not giving sufficient force to stop the motion by itself. The rear brake alone can easily stop this 170lb riders. But the front disc brake doesn't seem to able to stop while in motion... it slows down and i see the caliper griping the disc, but not enough by itself to stop the bike with me on it. I'm talking about less than 5 mph here. You guys think there is something wrong with my disc brake? Is there more instruction for me to adjust the front disc brake? The obvious adjustment with the threaded cable on the brake device and threaded cable stop on the top of the brake lever doesn't do much. If anyone has any tips please email. I emailed to [...], and I haven't get any response yet in last 24 hours...."
1,worst choice,"my worst choice in amazon, someone send in opened box one first of all. i regret i didnt return this very first time. noticible screch on the body.break line gear line, bolts, nuts werent tight, handle was twisted, not stright, so i have to adjust from local store which damaged another 25 dollers. this bike totalllly made in china so you can imagine the quality. now it sit on my living room, whenever i saw this i feel sick and tired of it. disguesting,,,i'd reconsider amazon.com"
1,Flimsy and too short,"Poorly designed product that can barely support itself when extended. Galvanized steel or thicker aluminum would make this a usable product.Also, it was much too short to fit my window opening (46"").I ended up cutting a piece of 3/4"" rigid foamboard (R4) to length and gluing 10"" aluminum flashing to both long sides with gorilla glue. I then cut a 4.25"" hole and installed a 4"" dryer vent with silicone adhesive. 10x more sturdy and provides good insulation."
2,"Cheaply Made, Make One Yourself","Was surprised how cheaply made this was. The vent on mine was crooked, looks like it was put together in about 10 seconds. Also looks like someone spilled something on it, has a sticky residue all over the metal. I am going to take it apart and just get some plexiglass and build my own. It might fit your need, but would look elsewhere."
1,Very poorly made & Dangerously sharp edges.,"Very poorly made about the same material as a soda can and about the same thickness. It does not stop wind or cold.Dangerously sharp unfinished sheet metal edges and protruding screws. I will stick with my home made piece of wood with a hole in it and4"" WHT Louver Vent Facefound here on Amazon."
1,Junk,If you want a quality product look elsewhere. This is junk and not even assembled correctly. It is tinny and the screws were not tightened and the holes not drilled correctly.
2,Flimsy with very sharp edges,"As other reviewers have noticed, the product is very flimsy, with very thin metal (like metal flashing) used for construction. As a result, the plate buckles a bit under the weight of the window, and it easily bends out of shape if you put too much pressure on it. Also, watch out for all the sharp edges -- you can easily cut your fingers. An alternative solution would be to purchase a window screen insert, and cut a hole in it for a vent which you can buy separately. Otherwise, if you are willing to accept its deficiencies, it pretty much works as advertised."
5,worthy little piece of metal,It does what it's made for and will make you glad you bought it. I would definately get another one if I needed it.
1,flimsy POS,"flimsy, in no way seals the window from outside air (it could at the very least have come with some foam tape) and best of all? it's too short when fully extended to run the full length of my window. it's my own fault for not measuring, but i just couldn't imagine that they'd produce something designed to go into a window that wouldn't actually fill a standard-sized window.in short: you'd do just as well to stick the hose out the window and surround it with blankets. looks equally unprofessional and is twice as effective."
5,silent and efficient,"This dehumidifier is quiet and it was very easy to attach a garden hose, to have it running all the time into the bathtub."
3,disappointed,"The bag is merely ok. The bag shown is a lovely patterned subtly colored bag with a bit of bling. What I received was a garishly colored, very cheap looking bag. To be fair though, I did receive a couple of other purses in the same order that are absolutely darling, just as described and they look just like their pictures."
1,"poor quality, zipper doesn't work","it's very poorly made. zipper didn't work when it arrived, and when I tried to pull it, thread was torn apart and beads fell...cheap stuff, shouldn't have ordered it."
1,Home video miss...,"I thought I'd see modified cars racing, drifting, and driven to their limits. What I got was a camcorded recorded video. What you get is a camcord home video production of a guy and his friends following expensive cars such as mercedes, porchse, hummer, and other expensive cars through interstate highways on a roadtrip. Nothing more. Oh, they actually have 2 minutes of camcord recording of japanese cars in Japan. I could have drove around in my car and video taped this myself. Don't even waste your time with this video. You'd get better action going cruising on a weeknight then waste your time with this accident.Go check out Grip Vol.2 & 3, or JDM Insider for the real import street racing scence."
3,"Some bad, some gems","This DVD has footage from the 2003 Players Club rally. They show each day of the rally with some clips of people driving, then a bunch of random clips from some car show (set to techno) and people doing donuts in the snow (set to techno). Lot's of techno music. The saving grace of this DVD is that it has some great ""hiding from the cops"" footage. Those segments make this DVD worthwhile."
3,Good for SOME games,"this controller only works for some games, but the agetec bass landing controller. Its a much better investment for the variety of games are actually compatible with it."
5,"Profoundly moving, changed my life.","This book takes you on a journey. Through its poetic, inspiring words, the reader will find himself transported to another level... a realm beyond the ordinary. Combining photographs and philosophy, Bond compels his listeners to realize just how precarious our contemporary world, beleaguered with technological paraphernalia, is on the verge of destroying our capacity for intimacy."
3,Inovative Kids music,Bought this because my daughter liked the song she saw on the Disney Channel. She isn't interested in the cd and would rather listen to her cd from Music Together classes. She may enjoy these more when she is a little older however and I think the songs are catchy.
5,You know these people.,"An enjoyable read. Like going to see old friends. Coleman gives us characters that we all know. She gives us a story that feels real, like we've already lived it, yet it still teaches us things about ourselves we did not know. The writing and pace is smooth and fluid. A recommneded read for all who love a good story."
3,Back Cover Description,"From world to world with Casher O'Neill. On the Gem Planet: seeking aid to free his home world from a tyrant, he was drafted for the bizarre rescue of an exotic alien being none of his hosts had dreamed of... a horse. On the Storm Planet: The help he needed was offered at a price - murder. O'Neill accepted, but the victim was ready for him - armed with love. On the Sand Planet: He overthrew its implacable dictator - though no one ever knew it - and began a new search for a stranger and stronger goal."
2,Love Robin McKinley but...,"Robin McKinley is one of my favorite authors. Her prose, her characters, her worlds are all terrific. From her retelling of the story of Beauty and the Beast to her highly original vampire novel Sunshine, I've adored everything she's written. Until now. Somehow, McKinley completely missed out on having a real story with the Stone Fey. Despite the childish format (with wonderful drawings) it's too adult for children yet not long enough or deep enough for adults. Try one of her other wonderful books but skip this one."
2,well written but dull,"when I finished this book I was disapointed althought ""the stone fey "" was,as all of Mckinley's books,well written I found the plot boring completly unlike the other books she has written such as ""spindle's end"",""beuty"" and ""rose daughter"".this book was sort of unfineshed and the ""end"" was stupid. I think the story was so short and dull it was almost not worth being written."
2,What a disappointment,"After reading and loving what was assumed to be a series of books, this was a disappointment. It was NOT appropriate to young children, and even failed to keep the interest of this adult. I can't figure out the purpose of the book."
1,"A book not ,a good story yes",The story has a certain mysterious quality that made you want to keep on reading. Nevertheless I was very disapointed upon the ending I found myself thinking McKinnley could have done better much better. As in THE BLUE SWORD or THE HERO AND THE CROWN and what ever is wrong with turning it into another BEAUTY. I would not recomend this book to a child they wouldn't like it nor to someone who loves to read as much as I do they would find it disturbing in the upmost but to someone who doesn't care so much and doesn't pickup a book often enough to know the difference between this and some of McKinleys other works I think they would really enjoy this as a first book
5,Lovely. Just lovely.,"Probably sounds like a bit of a cop-out, review-wise, when I say that you can't go wrong with Robin McKinley, but seriously, you can't go wrong with Robin McKinley. Her stories don't always end up just where you think they might, but they always seem to end up in the right place, which is difficult enough to accomplish. 'The Stone Fey' is no exception; strong characters, beautiful scenery, and the most graceful prose make this story a small marvel.And I mustn't forget the illustrations, which are pretty darn unforgettable. I won't waste a thousand words failing to describe them; let's just say that they are worth seeing, and that John Clapp's talent ranks up there with McKinley's.This book is worth every penny I paid."
3,Short and sweet,"It is a short story printed in its own book, with lovely illustrations. Definitely one of McKinley's earlier works - well, because it's out of print, but also because of the story itself. It is a gentle story, not much conflict, quiet resolution. Not terribly exciting, but sweet."
2,"Not her best work, and not for children.","Robin McKinley is my favorite author, and I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it not only for myself, but for my kids, and let them read it first. Neither said much about it, and I was surprised until I read it myself. The story is disturbing and of sufficiently adult content that I would not categorize this as a children's book. It is also not as well-written as her other books. There were even some sentences that I had to read a few times just to get the correct meaning. I loved the illustrations, but didn't like the story. Not too many nine to twelve-year-olds will get the point of this story -- I'm not so sure I did myself."
4,Replacement Battery,This is a replacement battery for the 12 Volt Rechargable Lincoln Grease Gun kit. I have good service out of the last battery that's why I purchased the same brand. Lasted 2 years of moderate use.
5,Good Halloween Book!,I ordered a lot of craft and cookbooks for halloween and this is one of my fave for sure!
4,Not for the die-hard Martha fan!,"This book is an excellent source for elegant party ideas and recipes. However, if you have subscribed to Martha Stewart Magazines, you already have seen these ideas. I much prefer the book, however, so I can throw out all those old Halloween issues!"
4,"Good, but not great","Halloween is not a big deal here in Australia, so I was looking for a inspirational book with plenty of how-tos and ideas... I bought this book after combing the Martha Stewart website, expecting more of the same great stuff. I was a little disappointed when it arrived. Still a good book, but I'd recommend going though the website first - a lot of the stuff in this book is contained there anyway. The book has a very appealing look, and is still a good read, but for sheer volume of ideas, all with easy instuctions, use the website."
4,Beautifully laid out book,"I bought this book for Halloween decoration ideas and this book didn't fail to disappoint. Unfortunately being an apartment-dweller, this book is geared towards people lucky enough to have a nice, big old house in New England with requisite front porch, etc. The food section provides some great ideas that go beyond candy corn and Dum-Dums, that anyone can try. It was fun just looking through the book. For those that go all out for Halloween, this is something that would be a welcome addition to their holiday deco library."
3,Book or glorified magazine?,"I found the contents of this ""book"" to be terrific. It is full of lovely pictures and creative, scary, unique ideas. Some of them are very labor intensive, but anyone familiar with Martha would expect that. On content alone I probably would have given it 4 1/2 or 5 stars. However, I was extremely disappointed in the format. When I opened the box my first thought was, ""I don't remember ordering a magazine."" That's really what this is. No, it does not have any ads and none of those annoying little subscription cards fell out of the pages but those are about the only differences. It is no thicker than a standard magazine, and in fact, not as thick as most of my issues of Marth Stewart Living. Because it is a book that should get a lot of use over the years, I can't help but expect that it will look dog-eared very quickly. I would much rather have spent a little more and gotten a hard cover version or at least a thicker book with smaller, sturdier pages."
2,If you don't already have the magazine....,"....It is a good book. Like the other reviewers, I bought Martha's Halloween magazine last year, and it has all of the same things, with only a few minor changes. I was also very dissapointed with the book, because the magazine was good and I had hoped for more of the same. So if you don't have the magazine, buy the book. If you have the magazine, save your money.... the one or two additional projects don't justify the cost."
1,Nothing more than her magazine from last year...,"If you bought Martha's Halloween magazine last year, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS! It is nothing more than alot of the same idea's and pictures, except with a hefty price tag. I was very disappointed in it and will return it."
4,The Martha of Halloween,"I really enjoy the book, seeing that I missed out on the special edition of the magazine last year. I love the photography and the ease of directions and instructional photos(the little dracula kid still weirds me out though) I have spent a year online looking for tasteful but creepy ""organic"" Halloween ideas. But after all that time, this book still has the best feel. I do agree that some new ideas would have been good."
3,What you expect.,"Nice pictures, quality book. Ideas & recipes you would look for from Martha Stewart."
2,I'm In shock!,"And still recovering...I finally bought this album to see what the big fuss was all about. There has been so many rumors and murmur, especially in the Naija community regarding this artist. So, I decided to find out for myself. Frankly, I'd like to know why this was produced and even distributed. The artist was out of tune most of the time and seemed to be struggling with it all. The wording of this whole album could have used some work as well, it all was just out of wack...from her search for her man to counting on her or calling out or being lonely its like what the heck?! Is that the blue print of her life really? OH MY.I suggest that for those of you looking to buy this piece of work, please save your money. Stick with Sade instead, by her greatest hits or if you want Pop, stick with Britney!"
1,T.Naija's voice is atrocious!,What did T.Naia do what the money?The money that her mama gave her for singing lessons?This is the worst attempt at singing that I have ever ever heard in my entire life. She should be ashamed of herself. The least that she could have done is take some singing lessons for a long while before going on to make a whole cd. The only part that was listenable was the background singing parts. Who the hell produced this girl? He should lose his license to produce. He did this poor T.Naija wrong. She is a fairly good looking gal. Maybe she can go back to modeling.

2,battery back for 680 not at same quality as the original,This is a package deal with a larger battery and a new plastic back to accommodate the larger battery. The battery is of good quality and will hold a charge much longer than the thin battery used in the 680. In fact it is the same battery used in the 650 so if you moved up to the 680 from the 650 just use the 650 battery. The new back is a slightly different matter. It is of much thinner plastic. Just slightly heaver than the plastic show through packaging used for many electronic equipment. It is not a smooth a fit and tends to fall off. It is hard to lock into place and even if you take extra time and attention in locking it on the phone it still tends of jar loose and fall off in the holster or your pocket. On long trips especially when I am using the radio or pod cast feature and the 680 battery dies I just take the back off and put the larger 650 battery in and I do not even bother with the flimsy easily jarred loose from back.
4,My hubby wears it with pride,"who could complain--it's a foam cheese sombrero, as promised. My husband requested it, and he seems to enjoy wearing it with friends, and otherwise."
5,Excellent for Hot Climates,"Our 17 month old loves these playhouses, but we live in Texas, and most are not well ventilated. I didn't want to spend a few hundred dollars for one she could only use inside, or outside for a handful of months per year.This playhouse is not only pretty snazzy looking, but also extremely well ventilated -- one completely open door, and a large window, but it also has a closeable door and a window with shutters, so she can still play Open! Shut! Open! Shut! to her heart's content. [See the photos to get a better idea what I mean.] I expect she will be able to use it though most of the summer here."
2,A Fundamental Misunderstanding,"Really, the fact that he calls it the Stanislavsky ""Method"" should say it all. If one is going to call one of the most respected and widely-used schools of acting a ""cult,"" (s)he should at least know what (s)he is talking about.Stanislavsky himself said that there is no Stanislavsky ""system"" (as he wanted his work to be referred -- lower-case s, quotation marks, and all), but only what works for the individual actor. Playing the action is what Stanislavsky emphasizes in ALL of his work.There is a STRONG sense of arrogance in this work. I don't understand the ""lines on a page"" part with no character -- it seems to produce an extremely shallow view of acting. There has to be a difference between what a 3rd-grader and a seasoned professional can do on stage. It has nothing to do with how well you read, in case you were wondering."
1,No Respect For Acting,"Mamet has no respect for actors. He also seems to think that the writer is the most important person in a play and a movie. In both instances, he is wrong. Watch a Mamet-directed movie if you don't believe me. His direction of actors sucks. Paul Thomas Anderson, now there's an actor's director"
2,Sense and Nonsense in the Theatre,"Mr Mamet makes a convincing case for the perfect actor being 'Joey' in 'Friends' - I had previously thought Brando was rather good myself, but now have discovered he was rubbish by reading this book. Entertaining silliness throughout - perfect for breaking the ice at play readings and provoking pretentious conversations among thespians and directors everywhere. I don't believe that Mamet's take on acting is nonsense... I accept it."
4,Good!,"The book I received was in pretty good condition, as expected. Shipped on time, nothing went wrong, & book is fine!"
3,dogmatic,David Mamet; Good play writer but his Book is repetitive and dogmatic. To follow Mamets logic all that an actor needs to do on stage is to read his lines. A robot would suffice. RO
4,Very good book for acting...,Love this book it breaks things down things is simple terms as far as learning and understanding acting. This is the best book ever so far definately a keeper it's so good you will want to read it again and again to get a better understanding of what acting is really all about.
3,"yes,but...","Mamet's book is excellent, and on the whole true, but often there is often something missing, and I realise this is sacrilege, and that thing missing is flavour. There is something a little too ""well behaved"" in Mamet's doctrine. Also, as Mamet himself would say, beware of doctrine. What is missing is something about ""mucking around"" and seeing what you can get away with. When something works it is self evident. Yes, the story is important, but so is how you tell it. There is something to be said for crash and burn acting. Mamet's book is the best. But it's a lot of FUN to break those rules. I saw an interview with Mamet where he admitted that there are times in rehearsal that all of his ideas about acting don't help. Basically his ideas are the jumping off point. Mamet says he may have been a criminal if not an artist. I feel that is what has been lost. Actors should be more on the criminal side than the side of the status quo. We should be human, not ACTORS."
5,Not to be taken personally.,"This book was recommend to me by a working Hollywood actress and acting instructor. She said that it is harsh and you cannot take what Mamet says personally, but it is valuable. I was amazed at how simply he trashes the ideas of the old schools of acting and suggests a more practical and accessible way to work as an actor. It's something that children can do.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in real acting and not just intellectualizing the simple yet difficult craft. It is also a must for anyone who wants to direct.I do however give the same warning that I was given. It is harsh and you cannot take it personal. But it is good."
1,Useless piece of junk,"I bought this unit some years ago (two or three) to perform computer services on the laptops on my house. I had to use it today and no laptop (or desktop) would recognize the device. I had DELL technical service (GREAT SERVICE) on remote assistance for almost four hours updating drivers, uninstalling, rebooting, etc etc etc...USELESS PIECE OF JUNK.BUY SOMETHING OF A KNOWN BRAND.YOU'VE BEEN WARNED"
4,memory lane,bought htis for my 90 year old father in law who saw Bea live back in the day when she played at the Meadowbrook in NJ. He loves it.
4,Good item,Item is as described. Fuel line fit was correct and looks great. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to run a fuel line to an Edelbrock carburetor.
3,engañado,la verdad da mucha apariencia pero pensaba que era metalico y para mi sorpresa es de plastico. hay que tratarlo con mucha delicadeza porque no se siente fuerte
3,"fun, but needs more reality!","Just like her other book, this was a fun read if you want to step into the mind and stories of Pamela. It is a hilarious quick read, with lots of little stories that remind you of the crazy tabloid tales of when she was with Tommy (aka ""Jimi"", in the book). Only problem, I didnt like the far leap into fiction towards the end -it seemed like the author and her ghost writer didnt want to say what really happenned between these two and concluded the story with a ""Thelma and Louise""-type ending. Not as much fun as the first book, and just a little sexier... :)"
2,Not as good as the first one...,"This book reads like your paperback porn novel, definitely not as good as the first one. If you like gratuitous sex this is the book for you."
1,Star *uck,"I love a trashy novel, i love a simple tale but this pathetic blah went nowhere and nothing ever happened. Even the sex scenes are half Mills n Boon in their vagueness.Nope, as much as it promised to be good trashy it turned to useless pulp within pages, never to redeem itself."
2,not as good as the first,"more raunchy than the first... but gets boring after awhile.. every other page has a sex scene, and after awhile it just gets old."
1,A little too oversharing!,"This book relates to her life wayyy too much. It should be a biography instead of fictional. Most of the events in the book are too close to actual events. It makes you think if she has any original thoughts in her head. I like her as a person, but I think she should not be an author. This book is not a good read."
4,A great read,If you read the first book you will definitely enjoy this sequel. Pamela Anderson adds a lot of personality to her characters and some of the story line is not so far off from her real life.
2,"Fun Read, But Predictable","Okay, Pam Anderson's books aren't good pieces of literature, and it wasn't meant to be. At best, it's junk food for the brain pretty much. Obviously her novels are somewhat synonymous to her own life, but eventually the sex scenes and rock-star lifestyle background gets kind of boring, old, and repetitive. Nothing shocking, nothing new, the characters are kind of like caricatures, and the plot is just silly and pointless."
4,Good Read,this book was a good read. something you can tell are personal experiences but some others are totally made up.
1,"Hard to believe, but it is worse than the first","You can read my review of Star and find out how I was tricked into reading that by a bookstore employee. Unfortunately, my husband remembered seeing that book on the shelves and decided I might enjoy the sequel. WRONG!!! I couldn't get past the first two chapters. There are far too many sex scenes in the first two chapters alone. Nobody could possibly be as stupid as Star. It is horrible. I swear that some of my brain leaked out of my head when I read those two chapters."
4,Read the first 200 pages,"Of all the object oriented programming books that I have read, this book is probably the most concise. The first 200 pages serve as the best object oriented dictionary that I have seen.Don't bother reading any of their other books, as they all seem to reiterate these first 200 pages"
