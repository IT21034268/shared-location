4,Great sewing Machine,I haven't sewen in quite a while. This machine is self threading and the bobbin automatically connects with the thread. Easy for hands with arthritis. The machine is light and easy to carry. Works great for hemming jeans and hems that are thick. Highly recommend.
4,Machine Worth the money,"I have owned this machine in less that three month. As a result, I am not in a position the comment on its durability.The machine works as I expected. Once I learned the functions, I became delighted with this product. One thing I like most about the CS-6000i is its ability to thread with ease. I am over 60 years of age. To thread a needle even with my prescription glasses is a great challenge. Luckily, the machine does it for me.Initially, I had problem with the User Manual. Apparently a single manual was written for several different models. Where there are differences, then the say ""For models with ..."" do this and that. This sometimes confused me.All in all I give this machine high marks. I have not tried any of the others in order to make a comparison. Neither is sewing my profession. For the price and what it does, I think it is worth buying."
5,Very happy!,I got this as a gift from my parents. I have to say that after I figured out how to use this machine...It was soooo easy! I have only had this one machine but I know that if I ever buy another it will be a Brother.
1,Sent back the same day I got it!,"I was really excited to get this machine as it got such great reviews. Upon opening it the machine looked pretty good although it was smaller than I had expected it to be. The machine had many great features and came with some nice accessories but for me, that's where it started to go downhill. When I started to sew I noticed that the tension was a mess. I tried absolutely everything to fix this issue and was never able to do so. I was using Gutermann thread, I made sure it was threaded correctly... As a matter of fact nothing changed no matter if my tension dial was at 1 or 8! So after many hours of fiddling with it I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon."
2,Does not last,"I've owned this machine for 6 years until it gave me a problem. I am a novice sewer, mostly using the machine for small, simple projects. It may not be the strongest, but I faulted myself when jamming it from fabrics that were too thick. One day the bobbin winder function stopped working. I took it in to get serviced; the sewing store folks basically told me the machine is fairly cheap, ""doesn't have a frame."" All the mechanics of the machine is attached to plastic, and the bobbin winder's plastic was melted and sticky. I'm not an expert on machines and sewing, but I suppose this machine is good for beginners, but it doesn't last."
4,DO NOT BUY THE CARRYING CASE BUNDLED W/MACHINE,"I haven't even opened the sewing machine box, but UNFORTUNATELY, the information in Amazon's review doesn't tell you that it comes with its own hard-sided case. Instead, they bundle with it the Brother Universal Case and offer a good deal on it. Good deal, unless you don't realize you don't need it!So, save yourself the trip to the USPO and the hassle and DO NOT BUY THE CASE!"
3,Okay for the price.,Sometimes the machine jams and the stitches really aren't clean on some of the patterns. It is good for the money.
4,Kind of wish I didn't get computerized,"I don't sew regularly, so I have to get out the instructions every time I use this. Even a plain straight stitch or zigzag requires the manual to figure out the settings. THE LED LIGHT IS A JOKE. There may as well be no light at all."
4,Great machine!,"I used my new Brother CS6000i to make several quilts over the past couple of weeks. It worked like a charm! The settings are so easy to use, and my poor old eyes really appreciated the self-threader.My only complaint is the throat of the machine is really too narrow to do much quilting. I made crib sized quilts and it was a big struggle trying to pass the material through the narrowish throat. Other than that, I love the machine.For regular sewing it is perfect!"
5,"Happy owner , of brother CS6000i sewing machine !","Before buying, I did my research, and the Brother CS6000i , had high ratings. When I, received the Brother CS6000i, I was so impress , I ordered one for my daughter. I have, been using this machine, on a daily bases."
2,"Great transaction, but how about the packaging","I ordered the sewing machine late for a Christmas gift, and had to pay extra for express shipping to get it in time. All went well, machine showed up on time in perfect condition. My only complaint is that the seller simply taped a shipping label to the sewing machine box and did not put it in a shipping box. The UPS lady was walking up the front walk when my daughter spotted her and the sewing machine box (the sewing machine was supposed to be a surprise) and quickly sent my wife to the other room so she wouldn't see what it was. If you are ordering from this seller, do not expect discretion on what is being shipped. Almost ruined Christmas."
1,Amazon Failure,Amazon decided not to put this in a box. It was a Christmas gift for my wife. She saw it on the porch when she got home. It ruined our Christmas. Thanks Amazon!This is not a review of this product as she has not used it yet.
5,Easy to Use,"I recently started quilting and hadn't sewn in almost 30 years. Although my skills were pretty rusty, I've found this machine easy to use. I've used a variety of stitches and the quilting foot. My sister has several machines and she recommended the purchase - a lot of bang for little bucks."
3,Easy machine for light sewing,"This is an affordable, easy to use, lightweight machine with many decorative stich options. However, I use a sewing machine almost every day for a variety of sewing projects, and have had to return/replace this machine 3 times already because it could not stand up to the regular use. It struggles when anything other than light weight fabric is used and is highly sensitive signaling errors often.For infrequent, light sewing, this should be a good choice, but for anything more, I recommend saving for something stronger."
4,Good machine for the price,"I am overall pleased with the performance of the sewing machine. However, there was a foot missing and I needed to call Brother to have them send me one. They did so in a timely manner."
5,I love my sewing machine!,I have sewn many projects on my machine and have had no problems whatsoever. It is so easy to use and has many useful features. I love it!
3,several jams of thread,"So far i have had several jams of thread in the bobbin housing. it takes on average 15 minutes to fix because i have to take plates off to get to jam. Other than that, the machine has performed well and is very easy to use. The multiple stitches are very nice. Nothing too advanced, but great for making decorative stitches on clothing and quilting."
4,"So far, so good","This is my third sewing machine (I still use my first one, a '60s pink Kenmore, and an '80s Singer.) This Brother has easy to use features, and I love the easy needle threading. But, it makes a knocking noise that I have not yet figured out. Maybe this is a normal sound, since I am used to an older machine. I've owned it only one month and so far, so good. I really think I'll be happy with the cs6000i and the price was right at amazon."
5,Love it,Works as expected and more. Seeing previous reviews about it not working properly made me think if I should purchase this. Simply read the instructions on how to thread it and how to put bobbin in and your set. I had no problems at all. As a matter of fact this thing hummmms when it runs. Not loud at all.
5,Amazing Sewing Machine,"Bought this to replace my old brother---was worried though because it was somewhat cheap in price for a sewing machine, but I was amazed --it is great--worth more than what i paid and easy to use too--this is my first electronic sewing machine and it was very easy to learn how to use"
3,Brother sewing machine,"I purchased this sewing machine after reading many good reviews about it. However, the instruction book is not as thorough as I would like it to be. I'm having trouble with some of the optional stitches and may have to go to my local fabric shop to see if they can help me with it. I'm kind of disappointed that it's not as simple to use as advertised. Otherwise, I like that it is light and I can move it easily. I like that it came with many accessories and a cover. I also like how quiet it is and that it has different sewing speeds."
2,Disappointment,"I've always stuck with Singer, now I know why.I ordered this product in March and I am already having to return it because it is not sewing correctly anymore. No, I am not a beginner sewer I have been sewing for 12 years.It worked great at first, hardly any issues. The base that attaches to the sewing machine is rather annoying, as the legs always cave, so it's not good if you have a lot material. Now, it will not sew anything remotely heavy. It appears to be sewing and makes the holes from the needle but there is nothing. It is light, and I think that might be the problem, cheaply made.I have contacted Amazon and they are letting me return it for a full refund which I will use towards a Singer machine.I would say that if you sew a lot, heavy and non-heavy items, go with a machine that is built better because ideally it will last longer.This is a total disappointment for me because I am without a machine for a bit."
5,Amazing,"The last sewing machine I used was my mother's. It was bought sometime in the 1970s I am pretty sure. This thing is amazing. Smooth, fast, accurate and easy to use. The upper threading is all numbered so you get it right every time. The auto button hole is awesome. I used it to make holes for a draw string in pajama shorts. You put on the buttonhole presser foot, choose the pattern you like, insert the button you are going to use, position and press the start button on the machine. It couldn't be easier. This is going to get a lot of use!My wife also wants to learn how to sew and the instructions for the machine are simple, and even suggest what stitch number to use for certain situations. It's really great. I wish I could give this thing 6 stars."
3,Brother CS6000i Advance Sew Affordable 60-Stitch Computerized Free-Arm...,"This is a totally new machine for me. My old Kenmore did not have all of these options. I am relearning to sew and will reserve the remained of my review for later. This is one of those things which I am going to have to keep the booklet next to me.For now, it was relatively easy to thread the machine, love the self threading (once I got my hands to work together)."
2,Pressure foot lever,"Unfortunately I recommended CS6000i to a senior center where I teach quilting. The center purchase 3 machines and they all have problems. The machines are making clunking noises and the thread keeps tangling. The walking foot gets stuck, the tension is horrible. I don't know what to do now. The center can not afford to get these machine repaired. If anyone have any suggestions, please let me know. Now the pressure foot lever does not stay all the way up."
3,Brother CS60001,"Very disappointed on how it threads the needle and the way you have to wind the bobbin. If I had known this, I would not of purchased it. Sews out good. I have other Brothers that I always liked. I guess this is why it was affordable."
2,Disappointing Sewing Machine...,"I was optimistic about this sewing machine since it had so many great reviews, but upon receipt I was sorely disappointed. I am an intermediate to advanced sewer and have two sergers, but wanted a simple machine that could make a nice straight and zigzag stitch. I know how to properly thread and work a sewing machine and the Brother CS6000i was a tension nightmare from the first stitch. I'm assuming that the machine I received had been bumped and bruised being sent through USPS, or that all of these positive reviews are coming from beginner sewers that don't know the difference between a good and a bad sewing machine. The final straw was that the feeddogs on this machine were plastic! I sent this cheap pile of plastic p00p back to Amazon and all I was looking for was a good straight and zigzag stitch, which this machine could not perform. I'm giving this machine 2 stars only because it might be a cute gift for a 7 year old?"
3,sewing machine,Works fine for making most sewing projects. Have not had any problems with the machine and fine for beginners or small projects.
4,Great so far,"I purchased this last month and have used it quite a bit. So far so good, I love it. I'm a novice sewer who has been taking some classes at a local store (renting one of their higher-end machines). I decided on the Brother CS-6000I after a lot of research. This was within my price range and gets excellent reviews. I did notice that when I set it on a hard surface I have some of the tension issues that people talk about, but if I set it on a softer surface (carpet) I have no issues with the tension at all. I have sewn through thin cotton and knits as well as multiple layers of heavy denim. As long as I switch to the appropriate needle....no issues! I also fixed the crotch-seam in a pair of my step-sons work pants that are a heavy twill. The crotch had so many layers I didn't think this machine would be able to do it. But I switched to a 90 needle and gave it a try....no problem! So far this machine has been a little trooper and I love that it only weighs 13ish pounds....easy to carry."
3,nice sewing machine,This is the first sewing machine I have used. Happy this far with the product. I really haven't had much opportunity to learn how to use it yet though. So far so good though! I am really enjoying.
1,tension problem,my machine broke after 1 year warranty is expired first foot plug in is broked i took to sewing center and they fix it and after tension problem is started and i can fix it by myself and took it to sewing center again and ask me 90$ to fix it
1,DO NOT waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this after reading a lot of reviews and this machine seemed to have gotten decent reviews. After using this machine 3 times the bobbin casing completely broke just sewing cotton calico. DONT WASTE your money! I am returning this horribly cheap machine!!!!!!!!! No sewing machine should break after 3 times of LIGHT use!
1,"Worth it, just don't buy from Kens Sewing and Vacuum Center !!!","This product is fantastic, it's very easy to use and is easily the most for the money. Unfortunately I bought it from a company with a 95% rating, I've learned my lesson. The powercord that plugs into the actual machine, the one you have to have to make it work, doesn't even fit ! And this product was supposedly, ""New"" ? How is it new if you pop in an odd sized cheap chinese made power cord that doesn't even fit the Brother machine ?"
1,DO NOT BUY IF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION,"Researching I felt that this was a great quality machine with the perfect range of features. On reveiving the machine I was releived to discover it was the perfect weight and size. However, it uses a really specific voltage (110-120 volts) and cord type so DO NOT buy this if you are situated in the pacific, especially Australia. Most European countries will have the same problem. As soon as I plugged it into the power outlet the votlage blew blowing up the motor in turn. The machine now does not function at all!!On contacting Brother they claimed no responsibility (which was clearly stated in the warranty) and it would cost $300 AUD to fix it.I am really dissapointed the voltage problem was not communicated to me when buying the machine even though they knew my location."
1,UK CUSTOMER,its not that I hate this machine I never got chance to use it!!!!! I was very excited to receive my machine and read the manual as I knew it was from the states and that the power source was different. The manual is very vague about changing the plug and did not make it clear you need a TRANSFORMER to change from 220 to 240 in the UK. I took it to a hardware store that advised an adaptor of which I used and my machine blew up. SUPPLIERS I WANT TO BUY ANOTHER BUT PLEASE GIVE ME A DISCOUNTED PRICE AS YOU DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT A TRANSFORMER IS NEEDED TO OPERATE THIS MACHINE IN THE UK! I SHOULD GET IT FREE AS IT IS DANGEROUS TO SUPPLY THIS MACHINE TO THE UK WITHOUT ADVISING A TRANSFORMER IS NEEDED!
5,Great Machine!,"I have had this machine for almost two months now and so far it has been very fun to use. I carefully looked at the reviews for this model and other models before buying this one and it seemed like most people liked the Brother CS6000I. So far I've sewn a patch on a shirt, fixed a zipper on my skirt, learned how to sew button holes(which I have never done before), and other small various sewing projects! It is so easy to use and it is very light! I can't wait to do more projects with my machine! The instruction book is fairly easy to understand and the price of this machine I thought was reasonable also. If you buy it, I don't think you will regret it and I hope you will have as much fun with it as I have with mine!"
4,nice little back-up machine,"My trusty machine finally expired and instead of investing money to fix it I researched machines for features and cost and picked this one up as a back-up machine. I sew garments and am a quilter. There is some play with the feed dogs but once I learned the ""quirk"" it was easy to compensate for by guiding the fabric and holding it more taut then I usually do with my other machines. I have had the machine for about 1 month but have pieced 3 quilt tops, lightly quilted a table runner and have made several simple pajamas for gifts. A nice little machine for the money with great accessories. When I get my new Brother QC-1000 this little one will become the one I tote to classes.great features for the money"
4,A nice surprise,When I lifted the box and took out what seemed to be very light flimsy machine i thought to myself here we go....Until i set it up and started to use it. This machine is wonderful! It plows through the faux fur material i work with easily. I have not broke a needle nor have I blown a motor..Which I have done. It is quiet and easy to use as well as multifuntional. I do reccomend this machine for those who have more than a little sewing to do!
3,Just okay....,"This machine is just fine for beginners or for those who will only use it sparingly. It's easy to use with a lot of fun stitches, but it's very very sensitive & doesn't like anything other than the best thread & light materials. The first day I got it it jammed up within 30 minutes but once I changed to a higher quality thread it worked fine-- for about an hour. As soon as I tried using some interfacing with cotton (a simple tote bag project), the machine jammed up again & I had to replace the needle. It ultimately finished the project, but there was some coaxing on my part. Needless to say, this machine doesn't like medium to heavy-weight material & you've got to use really good quality stuff on it, otherwise it will leave you hanging. On the flip side, I've made several sets of curtains and pillow cases with no problem. So, it's really all about what you need to use this machine for--"
5,Brother CS6000i Sewing Machine,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this sewing machine, both in local stores and online. I read many of the reviews on this machine before making the purchase. I have not yet had a chance to look at or try all the attachments, accessories, and stitches. There's so much!! The machine is very light weight, but seems very sturdy. It's very quiet and runs smoothly. Threading the top of the machine is very simple and I like that the bobbins are the same size as those I had from the Kenmore machine I'm replacing. The additional detachable table and hard cover are great bonuses. I was worried about having this machine shipped to Hawaii (cost and condition), however, to my great delight, shipping was FREE and the machine arrived in 4 days, in perfect condition!! I'm very happy with this machine and the price, and the convenience of home delivery cannot be beat! Thank you!"
4,good purchase,The machine works good. Had a small problem when first started because the bobbin holder was put in backwards. Once this was resolved it worked fine.
4,great machine for novice hobbyist,"I've taken a home ec class in high school and thats about it. kept coming across situations where a sewing machine would have been very handy for some project, or to hem pants etc. picked this up on strength of reviews. It's really good for someone looking to get a machine without needing to buy a bunch of other stuff since it comes with a couple of different feet and some tools and bobbins etc. only need thread to start sewing something. I haven't had any bunching problems, but i've been using metal bobbins that I already had. great machine. i haven't used all features, but ran through every type of stitch and used the awesome overcast foot to sort of ""serge"" the end of the fabric on some pants I tapered, that's really an awesome foot, I did not know would be included, but it makes for a perfect replacement for occasional light use serger.recommended."
2,"Lightweight, inexpensive machine.","I had this machine for a little over a week and just finished packing it up to ship back. It is so lightweight that it wobbled and rattled all over my sturdy sewing table when I sewed on the fastest speed. The thread broke often, regardless of the tension setting. Feeding fabric through was another challenge - it pulled to one side, much like driving a car out of alignment. It appealed to me because of the assortment of decorative stitching (which I use often). Maybe this machine was just a lemon, but I'm not willing to try it again.That said, it is not a terrible machine. When stitching straight, it did a good job. It would be good for having a portable back-up."
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars,"I saw the great reviews and I saw the terrible reviews. It seems like if you get a good one you are set but, too many are lemons. I got a lemon today and it is already back in the box to be sent back. I have been sewing over 20 years so I know how to use a sewing machine. Even so I carefully went through the book before starting. Followed everything to a T and still had weird bobbin issues (yes it was in correctly), bent a needle and finally it started making a horrible noise."
2,You can't teach an old sewing dog to use this machine.,"I've had a Sears Kenmore machine since 1974 that still works, but I lost most of the attachments during my last move. I was really looking forward to having a new machine, especially one with a quilting foot. The quality of this machine is poor. I was afraid that the bobbin winder was going to break when I adjusted it. It did not handle heavier fabrics well, especially since there is not an adjustment for the pressure foot to go over multiple seams. I was also disappointed that when using the foot peddle, I also had to keep adjusting the speed with the push buttons. I guess you can't teach an old sewing dog new tricks. I've been sewing for over 50 years, and used to be an industrial seamstress. Give me a machine that is made well and that I can control with the foot pedal. I sent this machine back within my 30 day Amazon return window. Now, I've ordered a Janome 500 Sewist machine. I hope that I'm happier with my new purchase."
3,self threading,"I like it, but I couldn't get it to self thread. There seems to be no hook as described. Threading the machine should be easier; you have to put the thread through an eye that is hard to get to. It is still new to me."
2,"Not sturdy, authorized repair centers few and far away","Thread tension not the best and getting worse though we haven't used it much. Problem may have been worsened by putting bobbin in wrong one time. Will now have to take it to be repaired,which is going to be an expense and hassle. Advise renting or buying a sturdier machine depending on how long you need it for."
2,BrotherCS6000i,"Bottom feeder actually ""ate"" my fabric twice. Had to return the first one and have learned I cannot do delicate fabric nor jersey (even with correct needles and thread). This machine is great for cotton or mud weight fabric only. Tried to ""quilt "" a baby quilt again bottom feeders made it too hard and neck is too small"
5,A Great Machine For A Great Price,"OK, let me be honest. I can't sew a lick. Nothing, zip. But, my wife loves this machine. She'd had a simpler Brother Sewing machine, and wanted this one for its computerized options. Now, I can't begin to describe what it does - except make her happy. She picked-it out, and found the deal on Amazon. And, she is thrilled!"
5,Paying for itself a job at a time,"I bought this machine because I'm tired of trying to find a decent seamstress or tailor. Particularly one that can hem pants and shirts. Hemming ain't rocket science. It should take all of a few minutes and should be really inexpensive. As it is, I have to make separate trips for dropping off and picking up. Add in that the work is often horrid when they throw it in with a bundle of other jobs for some sewing service somewhere. Then they charge $5-$10 per seam.So, I bought this little sewing machine and fixed some hems on a few shirts. It was really easy and took just a few minutes. Less time than driving to drop the work off. Every home should have a sewing machine and it won't take long before this little machine pays for itself."
5,I loved this machine,"I am very happy with my new Brother machine. I'm still getting to know it but so far, I'm sure it was the best deal I could have made. It has lovely stitches and I was particularly amazed when I tried the buttonholes. It was so perfect."
4,"MY ""CLASS"" MACHINE","I have 5 sewing machines and now I own my ""Class"" machine. It is so light that I take it to all my sewing classes and ASG meetings. Weighing about 10 pounds I can carry all my tools and machine in one ""Green"" bag! Easy to learn to use! Easy to thread! Easy to fill bobbin! Stitches are nice and even. It has 60 stitches that are easily selected. Automated threading is also a treat on such a little machine! I would recommend this machine for a new sewer, a teenager or someone who just needs a machine to take to classes because it is truly ""sew"" affordable and I never have to oil it!"
5,Awesome machine!,"I bought this machine online at amazon a few months ago and I love it! After ten years of suffering with a cheap machine that I bought at Walmart for $100, this thing has been a dream come true! No more struggling and fighting with the machine! I love to sew, but with my old machine I always ended up yelling and complaining - no problems yet with this one! I have already made several skirts with it, and just purchased a brother serger to compliment this machine. I am now a Brother sewing machine fan! This machine is so easy and simple to use. You will not regret it!"
4,Great machine,It does everything it's supposed to do and even sews through vinyl. Learned how to use the one-step buttonhole maker using the Singer bookThe New Sewing Essentials (Singer)and it works great. This was my first machine I purchased (at Wal-mart) and I have no regrets. It's a great starter machine.
5,Great value on a sewing machine!,"I do sewing for charity (Cancer Society) making chemo caps. I needed a machine that could stand-up to heavy use for various types and thickness of materials. The Brother CS6000I has been easy to use and has the power to get the job done. I bought this as a back-up for my 32-year old Viking, but I prefer using the Brother CS6000I. I like the ""Needle Up/Down"" function and the needle threader is a real time saver. The task light built into the machine could be brighter, so you will need to have additional lightling when sewing.Brother CS6000I 60-Stitch Computerized Free-Arm Sewing Machine with Multiple Stitch Functions"
3,Sewing Machine,Sewing MachineI have not had time to unpack and try out... Too much going right now! Looks like it will work for some quilting which is what I purchased it for.
2,Not so great,"I was just starting out as a sewer so I got this machine becasue it ""appeared"" to do a lot for the money. It is ok as far how it works its nice to have the all the stitches but it is very load sounds like it is breaking (in fact I thougth it was and it was just a bad machine until I heard that is common with brothers) it also DOES NOT EMBROIDERY... do not believe that. also you cant really go past med speed or it starts acting up. look else were because in 6 months you will be better then the machine can do."
1,Bogus discount!,"Today, 2/8/11, Amazon is advertising this machine as marked down from $449 to approximately $180. I've searched carefully online, and can't find any place charging anything like $449 for it. Most stores are charging $150-$190. The highest price I could find was at Home Depot, $299. Don't buy this machine thinking you're getting a big bargain -- you aren't. It may be a fine machine and worth every penny of the $180 or so Amazon is charging, but I'm so annoyed at being deceived that I'm canceling the order I impulsively put in a couple hours ago."
1,Crappy..,bought a sewing machine to surprise my wife but the only surprise was that she couldnt do much with it. in the process of trying to send it back since it is the only item in my whole history i cannot file a claim against.
5,Perfect for a beginning sewer.,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I knew absolutely zero about sewing machines when setting it up. The instructions are easy to understand, and the machine is so easy to use. I love the computerized stitches. The slowest sewing speed is actually very slow too, which is nice for just starting out. Great value."
4,Fantastic machine!,I love this sewing machine! The speed levels are great for when I need to sew slowly and quietly or for whizzing through projects. It's a breeze to operate and as always the Brother manual is extremely helpful. The only thing that I'm not completely satisfied with is the needle threader. It doesn't always line up with the eye of the needle and I have to push it sideways. It makes threading the needle very awkward and frustrating.
1,Please Avoid this one!,"It just stop working, the bobbin spins off and then pulls the thread into a huge clump! Wish i never got this one!"
1,Returned it next day!,"This machine was returned in less than 24 hours. I was very disappointed. I was having thread tension issues after sewing for only a few hours. At least with my old machine it took years to act up. This was a waste of time and money. Skip this and check out better quality machines and avoid Brother! I've since purchased the Janome DC2011 and am in heaven! Spend a little more and you'll be much happier, but if you need a budget machine pick up the 49 dollar one because its about the same as this one!Amazon was FANTASTIC in refunding my money super quick!"
2,Brothers CS6000i issue with bobbin tension,"I purchased this machine to replace an older model. At first this machine worked really well, sewing quickly and effortlessly through multiple layers of fleece. After about a week of daily use, the bobbin tension stopped working and I could not fix it. After researching the issue, I found the loss of bobbin tension is a frequent issue with this model. I decided to return it for refund.I would not purchase this model again."
4,Great machine...,Good unit as such. My wife is loving it. Giving only 4 stars as it is a little complicated at start.
5,Three years later and still in love,"No doubt about it, I love this sewing machine. I ordered this machine three years ago. I am a hobby sewist but I use the machine nearly every day. I have sewn multiple quilts, purses and bags, and more childrens clothing than I can even recall. I've done zippers and buttonholes, used the special knit stitch and several of the decorative stitches. I've sewn satin, chiffon, silk, canvas, denim, knit, and cotton as well as odd things like thin plastic or paper. I have never had any issues. I was skeptical when I saw the price. I didn't know if it would hold up to the ammount of use I would put it through. But three years later it is still going strong (and I don't do regular maintenance like I should so it's longevity is no thanks to me really). I am absolutely thrilled with my Brother and I recommend this machine to everyone."
1,Piece of junk,"I had this machine six months before it started falling apart. First the bobbin winder, then the bobbin case, finally the electrical system. Sure, the price looks good, but this is a very cheaply made machine that isn't built to last.I'm an experienced seamstress and used the machine at least a couple days a week, so if you intend to use your machine only rarely and for simple tasks, it *might* hold up for you. Then again, if you need just basic sewing functions, you're much better off with an inexpensive Singer. I'm now looking into buying a Singer again (used to have a basic model that never gave me any problems). It'll cost more up-front, but probably not in the long run!"
2,not for heavy fabrics,"This machine has a lot of bells and whistles: One-step buttonhole, 60 stitches, 7 different buttonhole styles, etc. It's also got variable speeds which is nice for beginners, and comes with a package of presser feet that would cost $50 or so purchased individually.However, my major disappointment was that it did not sew through more than 3 layers of denim without putting up a fight. The needle gets stuck in the fabric, it makes a horrible noise, and then displays an error message. Not so good if you want to do something as simple as hem a pair of jeans. Going slow or fast does not seem to make a difference. In addition, some of the fancier buttonholes (keyhole for example) look terrible.My experience has been that if you want a computerized machine that sews through heavy material you're going to have to pay around $300. The Brother Project Runway machine goes through thick material without balking, unlike this one."
3,Tension Problem Stories Are True!,"There are many things to love about the CS6000i. My favorite thing is probably the setting that allows the needle to stay in the fabric when you quit sewing. The drop in bobbin is great and it's extremely quiet and smooth.With the 4+ star rating for this machine, I chose to believe that the tension problems mentioned in some of the reviews were not common and just a fluke in a machine every now and then. However, my machine sewed wonderfully the first day, but day two was a different story - it was like a gremlin had come in during the night and swapped machines. No matter how I adjusted the tension, the threads were laying on top of the fabric and not forming proper loops. The seams were puckering (I was sewing on same fabric as day one) and the stitches were uneven, loose and not secure.I'm returning the machine before my 30 day guarantee is over. It has everything you could want in a sewing machine, but the quality just isn't there like in my older model Brother."
5,Great product!,"This was my first time ever using a sewing machine or even sewing for that matter. Very easy to use, like that it has a variety of stitch patterns, one thing I noticed, however, is that when I'm sewing on denim, at moments (e.g. the seam of jeans) the machine will jam and the needle won't go through, but usually after a few tries it makes it through. Overall I'm very happy with the product and would recommend it."
3,Not Sure If This is a LEMON,"I thought I really liked this machine. It has many features that are so convenient. However, since shortly after I started using it in June, it's making an awful clunking noise when I sew. The noise is in the back in the motor area. I've taken it to the service center and they couldn't figure out what was wrong since it didn't make the noise when they operated it. The minute I got it back home it's doing it again. The repair people suggested it's threaded wrong. I've reread the book and tried everything I can think of to no avail.The repair people suggest that as long as it sews satisfactorily to keep using it. I will do this but the noise is very irritating.Any ideas?"
2,Be careful,"Be careful, while the machine is quite useful and easy to use, look in your manual and you will see that there is no mention as to the oiling of this particular model. I just thought that somehow it was omitted and emailed them at customer service. They responded 2 weeks later, telling me that you have to take it in to a professional to have it lubricated. That should have been disclosed before I bought it, I would definately not have purchased it. I don't know what the basic charge is for service in your area but mine is $80, this machine is definately a throwaway. I will buy a Singer after this one goes, and it will. My advice-----STAY AWAY, UNLESS YOU DO NOT MIND PAYING FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE."
2,Don't expect it to last long,"This machine has great features for the price but is not meant to last very ling. Also, it has a weak motor. If your sewing multiple layers of fabric of leather, this machine won't handle it very well. It is a good machine for a beginner that won't abuse it. If your rough on stuff this machine WILL break."
5,"wow, finished project within 2 hours of setting up!","I got this around 11 am, and set it up very quickly in half an hour. I started sewing a project and finished it by 1. This is a fantastic product- it makes me feel more confident sewing. Yay! I'm a beginner and so even though it has all these advanced controls, it wasn't intimidating as I thought it might be."
4,perfect for beginners,"I've never used a machine in my life, so I was very nervous about how ""easy"" it would be to use. I'm glad to report that it's true! Read the starting up guide, and I was off and sewing. I'm starting off slow..hems, next is pillow cases and curtains and this is just perfect for me..."
2,Won't Sew Through Mutiple Layers or Thick Fabrics,"This machine has a lot of bells and whistles: One-step buttonhole, 60 stitches, 7 different buttonhole styles, etc.However, my major disappointment was that it did not sew through more than 3 layers of material without putting up a fight. The needle gets stuck in the fabric, it makes a horrible noise. Not so good if you want to do something as simple as hem a pair of jeans. Going slow or fast does not seem to make a difference.My wife`s experience has been that if you want a computerized machine that sews through heavy material you're going to have to pay around $499"
1,Tension Issues!!! Beware before you buy...,I bought this machine because of the overwhelmingly amount of good reviews compared to the bad reviews. But it seems the bad ones were right. At least for my machine they were. I couldn't make it through one project without the tension on this machine messing up. It goes back and forth in the same stitch line between ok to not ok...good tension...loose tension...crazy! Such a headache. I am returning this for a full refund. That is the good thing I can say about all this..Amazon customer service was great!I was sewing on an older Kenmore (Janome) before this that I borrowed from a friend. Its stitches were far superior. Definitely going with a Janome. After going the cheaper route I see why saving to spend a little more is so worth it.
1,Why did I not get anything with this except the bonus items????,"I am really ticked off to see a whole list of things that are suppose to come with this machine and then I am only finding the ""bonus items"" in the box! I wanna know where these different types of pressure feet are and screwdrivers, needles, seam rippers and so on. I didn't receive any of that!! Wth"
2,missing items,The description on Amazon regarding contents is inaccurate. I did not receive the wide table extension nor the DVD. These were two of the features I looked forward to receiving.
1,Piece of junk!,This machine broke two days after I received it in the mail. Do not buy! All parts are plastic and subject to break easily. Stupid bobbin case design lends itself to failure.
4,Sewing made easy!,"I love my Brother CS6000i! I own a boutique, and I really needed a sewing machine that let me make dresses, pants, bags, jammies and more, and this machine did just that! It's easy to use, has 3 speeds, which I love, and so many stitches to choose from!! The automatic threader makes it easy to use if your eye sight is not so good, so you're not sticking thread right through the needle, and the drop in bobbin is amazing! I would suggest this machine if you are looking for a good quality machine, that isn't too expensive, but isn't cheaply made!All in all, I would use this machine forever if I could, however, I just upgraded to the Brother SE-400 sewing & embroidery machine and I LOVE IT! <3 I think Brother has met my expectations and more with BOTH machines!"
4,Great product for the price.,I decided to really start sewing again after making 20 tablecloths for my daughter's wedding. I gave myself this machine for my birthday to replace the Kenmore I had. Very good machine for the price. Needle threaded is iffy. The bobbin has to be wound perfectly and I try o use Gutermann thread. A good workhorse with great options. The carrying case is handy and the accessories provided are generous.
4,Not too bad,Bought this as my first try-out on using a machine. Was impressed with quality & functionality. I was able to maneuver the machine with ease.
1,:[,I am editing my review. I have now had the machine a year and a half and the motor has died. It will cost me to fix it. I am quite dismayed with the poor workmanship of this product and failure of the company to come up with a cusotmer friendly solution. My only option is to pay to have it repaired! I am on the market for a new machine and it will NOT be a Brother!
5,"Great Machine, Low Price","I've had this machine a little less than a year. No problems at all! This replaced a much more expensive Kenmore Elite that I had nothing but trouble with. I used the quilting attachment for the first time last week and was blown away by how easy it was to sew in circles, frontwards, backwards, it was amazing! I'll be doing a lot more machine quilting in the future. Great stitches, easy to use, all for a low price."
1,piece of JUNK,"I probably gave this thing a bunch of stars and a shining review when I first got it 2 yrs ago. But I would like to recant my statement and say this sewing machine looks nice and seems very easy to use, with all the neat little stitches and fun things it does, WHEN it decides to work properly. Which is about 20% of the time. I spend more time messing with the bobbin and tangled thread (usually the expensive decorative stuff, too, love wasting that) than actually sewing anything. And the tension gives me fits too. It doesn't seem to matter which way I turn the wheel, I'm going to have loops, even after replacing the needle. I am ready to take a hammer to the machine. (By the way, I hope this review makes some sense; I'm writing as my project sits, unfinished, in the jammed sewing machine. I am not pleased.)"
5,so far it's great!,"this machine has features I never expected to have at this price! so far everything I've tried works wonderfully. it's my first electronic machine and is very different from my old one, so there was a bit of a learning curve at first, but the manual was very helpful. I love the drop-in bobbin that I can SEE while I'm sewing, and the needle-down feature is great! I recommend this one!"
2,ITEM WAS PREVIUOSLY OPENED. Incomplete,"My wife contacted Brother because the box did not contain the CD that was supposed to contain instructions on how to use the sewing machine. Brother said it needed receipt and proof of purchase from Amazon.The documents were faxed, scanned and e-mailed to Brother. The e-mail was deleted with out being read.Still not resolution.We are sending back the machine to Amazon."
1,Horrible tension!,"I learned to rely on reviews only after-the-fact!! This machine is awful!! I bought mine about 2 yrs ago, and it worked ok for about the first year sewing very simple things (pillow cases & such). But after that, it went downhill like it was on a luge! I made the gigantic mistake of not doing enough research before I bought it. It loses it's tension very, very easily. I took it in to be repaired, which cost almost as much as the machine itself. It then worked great - as long as I only used straight stitches. Anything other than a straight stitch on a lightweight fabric will mess the tension up severely!My biggest suggestion for this particular machine, is DON'T BUY IT!! It's just not worth all the trouble!"
3,Second project and I have to bring to service center,"Purchased this machine in Nov 2012. I am new to sewing and there were great features, easy to thread and seemed to be perfect for my beginner projects. I started my second project and as soon I began to sew, it started as if it was in reverse and gave me an error 6 code. I cleaned the bobbin case, changed the needle, looked for any loose thread (as that was supposed to be the problem) and alas, still reverse, E6. Called customer service to see if there were any other areas I should check and it needs to go to service center. Disappointed. Hopefully, it's a quick fix and I can get back to it quickly."
4,I love this Sewing Machine,I had a very basic brother sewing machine before buying this computerized sewing machine. i am a beginner self taught sewer. Brother products are super easy to work and it offers quality in every project that I have done!
2,This machine is not for soneone who would use all the time.,"The needle theader doesn,t work every time.The case is hard to carry with the set up it has.I wish it was more user freindly."
4,Best machine that doesn't break the bank,"I just ordered my second CS600i. This was the first machine I purchased when I began seriously sewing for my daughter. It was truly a great machine and really easy to use. It had everything I needed to make lovely clothes and some great ease of use features. I LOVED it, but unfortunately I got a needle fragment stuck in the bobbin case while sewing WAY too much fabric at once and ruined it. Totally my fault. I needed a new machine ASAP and couldn't replace this one locally. I bought the Progect Runway Brother model and it just isn't the same. It isn't a smooth, no variable speed control, or auto needle position button. I have found that I really miss these features so this machine is my birthday present!"
1,E6 problems,"I have had more problems with this machine, the E6 message keeping coming on, indication of thread tangled in the machine, however, I can find no thread in the machine, even after taking the machine apart as much as possible, this is happened so far several times, a few times I cleaned it and it was fine, twice it was a major problem but after a few days , it cleared out itself, but now after two weeks I still can not get the machine to work, tomorrow I wil bring it to the shop, and it's only a few months old. I have never had this much problem with a machine and I have been sewing for ver 30 years. I have a very inexpensive Shark machine, I have to keep going back to."
4,Great machine,This Brother machine is everything that I'd hoped and more. The extra accessories that come with it including the wide quilt table made it easy to start quilting right out of the box. Ease of setup for the thread and bobbin are great time savers. I've had it for a couple months now and love it.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the needle change screw. It uses a flat head screwdriver in the throat area (very tight to get to) and tends to slip off the screw too much. Better design would make it perfect.
3,Horizontal adjustment is not so good,"Works good, height is also good and its strong enough for weights of SLR cameras, but the horizontal adjustment is not sturdy and after 2 months if you tighten to fullest still you cant fix its horizontal axis and it needs hand support while shooting"
4,"Basic Tripod, No more No Less","If you're looking for a basic+ tripod, this will work. Know, though, that this isn't a pro or semi pro level piece of photography equipment. I used this tripod when I was getting into photography, the hook at the base of the down stem is good in the wind so you can stabilize the tripod, I just hung a full Nalgene to the bottom of it. It never broke on me, but I use a different one now that my needs have moved on.Easy to use, easy to tote, Good basic+ tripod."
1,Was out of stock so didn't get this item.,after I placed order and it was confirmed I got a notice from the seller that item wasn't available.
4,Help We Can All Use,"This is an easy-to-read self-help book which doesn't get bogged down with words. It is subdivided into 24 one-hour segments. The idea is to read each, perhaps one per day, and spend an hour thinking and then acting upon the suggestions.It differs from many such books in that you can easily put it down and pick it up later without losing continuity. It does have a Christian slant, though could be useful for anyone."
5,Great book to help you improve many areas of your life,This is a very good inexpensive book to help you change many different areas of your life. I am planning to make reading this book a part of my daily routine. It has been a great help to me.
1,Does not taste good!,"I would not recommend this product because of the smell and taste. I even added sweetener and lemon before I tasted it. I would recommend ""FertiliTea"". I know the two products have some different ingredients, but it's not worth it to me to try this one. I cannot attest to the actual effectivenss of ""Conceptions Tea""-I'm not sure on how well it works for conception, but I wasn't willing to find out. I took one sip and had a stomach ache for the rest of the night and had a bad taste in my mouth even after brushing my teeth and rinsing with listerine. I was excited to try this for trying out different herbs and I liked that it had Wild Yam Root in it. I am just going to take Wild Yam Root pills instead. If anyone tries this and has any suggestions on how to curb the bad taste I would be willing to try it again but for now I'm sticking to ""FertiliTea""."
4,Good for beginners,"These strings are ok for beginners to use. They are cheap and durable, but that is about the only thing they have going for them. Students beyond the first or second year should look for better brands, like Dominant or Helicore. If you are serious enough to be buying strings here, you should talk to your teacher about a better brand."
4,Good strings for the beginning student,"I really like these strings because they seem to be fairly well made and they're cheap. The original E string I got with my violin broke pretty quickly after I got it, but this new one has lasted through much more abuse and shows no sign of breaking anytime soon. I think the sound produced is better as well, though I have no clue how it stacks up to more expensive strings. I don't really have anything bad to say about these strings, but I gave them four stars simply because I have an electric violin and can't speak to their tone in an acoustic."
5,Red Label Violin Strings,These are the strings my daughter prefers for her fiddle over all other brands of strings. They are also very reasonably priced.
2,Not Too Good but O.K. for Beginners,These strings would be o.k. for a beginner to the violin since you don't want to invest too much in something that may be a passing hobby. I found I did not like these strings even on my cheap violin and I could not get a good sound out of them. They are thin and sound cheap even though they cost quite a bit which like most cheaply made strings for the violin they always sound like banjo strings to me. For beginners these strings would be good especially for people with children who play. I am still a beginner and I can't bring myself to play with these strings anymore now that I have found better sounding ones. Though it comes with all four just get ready for the sound they make when played. Some people like them I guess but me I can't bring myself to recommend them unless you don't mind sound for someone starting out. If you like them then have at and buy more but for me its merely two stars and not worth it for me.
1,don't buy these strings,"These strings are the dreadful. They sound bad, and are uncomfortable to play. There are other cheap strings that sound much better: prelude, piranito..."
5,Violin Strings,These are very comfortable and easy to put on. I am new at the violin so it was very helpful to be easy to use.
2,wth,I use to use these strings in 4th grade for my violin and they were great..I just got my string set today and the D string was lose and the damn thing snapped on me...what crap...I wish i could get my $14 back!
5,Everything Kundalini,"I put this book right next to Healing the Split by John Nelson as two of the best books on Kundalini. One reason is that they both holistically look at theories, personal accounts and scientific research. They also explore individual/social relationships. Both are very well rounded and grounded books that should always available on the market!"
5,Read it cover to cover,"This is a series of articles about Kundalini that cover any and all aspects of this phenomenon. Some of the articles are clearer than others, but almost all helped me to create understanding. I had already read quite a bit about Kundalini, but I still needed to read this book. It's not an instruction book to guide you through the Kundlini experience, but it gives more conceptual understanding of the phenomenon itself."
3,Nice box but very small.,It's a very small box but serves it's purpose if you only want to carry your best cards in it.
1,item is much smaller than it appears to be.,from the way the box looks it seems much larger from what we received. i thought this would hold all of his cards but its about 1/3 the size of an animal cracker box. i would need to order 20 of these to fit his decks in them. im not very happy honestly.
4,Like it so far!!,I'm giving it for stars for delivery and product condition. I'm now trying it and will have to give it time to see if it actually does what it claims.
3,Very bad condition shipments,"Maybe the product somehow is good, but really I felt unsatisfied when I received my package. A lot of capsules inside the medicine container were opened accidentally probably because of the bad shipping. The powder inside the capsules had spread inside both container"
4,VERY GOOD,"Right now I am listening to I ONLY HAVE LOVE FOR YOU, the best song on the record. Great beat and excellent guitar. Almost all the other cuts are good. This guy is good! GOOD SOUND is hampered by a low mix."
4,Total Leadership Quality,"Communication in leadership includes awareness of the receiver. ""For high performance, leaders mak it easy to revceive their messages."" (p 74) Leaders listenm, seek opinions, encourage and compormise. The key is to energize and develop people. It's energy. The book has many useful management tools (surveys, inventory, analysis) for the information age leader. From the book, a leader could design, implement and analyze a training plan. The book is a cookbook. Eric J. Lindblom PhD Harvard"
1,NOT PACKED WELL,"I purchased this item, along with others to put in my babys nursery. This Item arrived quickly, but was not packed well, the frame arrived broken, It was the resin that was broken, as there is no glass with this frame. I would have returned, but I live on a militarty base overseas, and it would have cost me more in postage than the frame cost. So, all in all, it was a total waste."
4,To Be Read by a Warm Fire Only,"As a longtime fan of Edward Ellsberg, I constantly search for his books both in stores and flea markets. Hell On Ice is frequently available on the used book market but buying a new copy makes sense after reading it. This is a must read for anyone who has ever been cold, wet, stuck in a snowstorm or would rather just read about it. Admiral Ellsberg captures the bravery, determination, skill and dedication of a small sampling of these heros of the Jeannette. Achievement of their stated goals is quickly traded for mere survival as this expedition takes the darker and colder side of fate seemingly at every juncture. This book is a fitting tribute to sailors of the era before radio, radar or GPS. A great gift for anyone with a sense of adventure and a cautionary tale for the brave people who challenge the unkown."
4,Great Survival Story,"I first read 'Hell on Ice' when I was a senior in high school(1954-55). I was not a very good reader and often didn't finish the assigned reading. When I started 'Hell on Ice', I could not put it down. I completed it over a week end. The story turned me on to the pleasures of a good story. After 'Hell on Ice', I read any adventure story I could get my hands on.I plan to give it to my grandson who is also having problems similar to mine. Thank you."
4,Dancing the Dream,"This book is easy to read, with sensible suggestions that can be incorporated into your life with relative ease."
4,Dancing the Dream,This is an excellent book. It needs to be read slowly and the steps of Initiation must be understood. If not then it is hard to follow the path where the book leads. I am reding it now and enjoying the lessons it holds.
4,"Very beautiful, believable ring.","I love this ring. The delivery was very fast and came in a pretty box. Unfortunately, I have to send it back for a replacement because the middle stone is a little loose, not very tightly mounted in the prongs. Otherwise, this is a gorgeous ring and very believable- looks like the real thing. It looks much better than the picture."
3,OK,Item was ok - I did not like the way it looked on my finger once I received it. I gave it to my mom and she loved it - she wears it all the time.
3,Exactly what you pay for,"This ring was ok, but the outer parts of the ring bend very easily and the stone itself rattles after a week of owning it. This ring is exactly what you are paying for, it really wasn't exactly what i expected but i should have known better. I wouldn't suggest it for anyone."
5,Real R& B !,"I was not lucky enough to see the Purple Hearts over here in Perth ,they were an Eastern states band, but I was lucky to hear their music and see them on some tv shows in the sixties. At the time they were out and about there were many other group that were into the same thing The Pretty Things, Stones and many others. For an Aussie band at that time seeing we did not have a big population they were great! Later they became Lobby Lloyd and the Coloured Balls, Lobby was our version of Eric the God Clapton,a great guitarist who later played with Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, there is some of the Coloured Balls music on this cd. If you are into the real R&B then add this to your collection."
5,Great tool for changing how we work,"One quote says it all. Jensen closes the book with a touching epilogue. Then says: ""Simplicity becomes important only when we stop to consider all the truly amazing discoveries and advances that did not happen today. Or how many opportunities for personal, corporate, and community growth didn't fit into today's 1,440 minutes. All because of the convoluted ways we used people's time and attention."" Amen! Get this book and change how your company uses your time and attention."
4,Clear Choices: Compelled me to change,"Why I really liked this book is not because it provided answers for all my complicated problems. But that the author kept coming back to how many choices are within my control. And he provided the tools and ideas to help me make new choices: Behavioral Communication for how to communicate more effectively. The CLEAR model for how to listen and hit delete more often. Know/Feel/Do for how to organize my thoughts more easily. I don't know if my life is simpler for having read this book, but I certainly feel like more of my everyday choices are now within my control! (...)"
1,"Too confusing, hard time reading it","I liked the idea. But the book is very bad, badly laid out, badly written, and very hard to just read.So much for simplicity."
1,Too simple,"I read a lot of business books, so I know when I've make a purchase mistake. This is one. There's so little of substance between the covers that many pages use huge caps and double spaced quotes from someone else. All this isn't even tied into the text effectively. The rest of the text is loaded with quotes from lots of interviews, but there is a lack of boiling it all down into something new. I have no idea where all these great recommendations came from. Believe me, the emperor has no clothes."
4,Missed opportunity,"Good content, but horrible design/layout. Your sections, chapters, punchlines, quotes and font variety confuse, not clarify. You missed an opportunity to put your recommendations into practice."
3,Not impressed -,I read this book with the idea that simplifying things would make the organization leaner and more agile. I did not connect with the author.
3,Simplicity is Complex,"This book offers a five-step process for communicating change:* Know which things are important* Consider how people will feel when you change these things* Use the right tools to communicate* Create expectations and then manage those expectations* Create a ""teachable view"" of what you're trying to achieveThe concepts in the book are valid. Unfortunately the execution of the book with cluttered layouts, and use of too many fonts falls short on delivering on the promise: Simplicity."
5,"Compelling, Practical, Do-able","Clearly, a lot of people absolutely love Jensen's premise (and matching layout): We need to approach what makes work so complicated in a more thoughtful way than ""Keep It Simple Stupid"". Clearly, a few did not. (Maybe they couldn't find anything ""new"" when asked to rediscover and spend more time on the basics.) We each have very personal views about simplicity.For me, that's exactly what makes this book so compelling and useful. Jensen details what we must do at work and in our e-spaces: Tailoring information and experiences to each individual. He spends half the book on how our work-tools and infrastructure need to change for that to happen. As others have noted, his tools and models make many of today's most important ideas -- Strategy [Blown to Bits], Conversation [Cluetrain], etc. -- practical and do-able.Get lots of copies of this book if you're interested in changing in how knowledge work gets done in your company!"
5,Between The Spines,"There is so much depth between the spines of the cover of this book ""Simplicity"" that the author knew that he had to break up the text with tools and easy-to-use ideas in order to keep the reader from taking in to much at one time. All of our society needs to learn from the concepts of this book and apply them, not only to business, but to their personal lives as well. Life and business has grown more and more complex, but Bill Jensen shows us how to identify the problems, cut out the clutter and the mess, how to work with others in this information age and in doing so how to gain control of our companies and our personal lives. This is a book that will definitely get you out of the box you are in and lift you over and up until you see the path more clearly than ever. Kudos to Bill Jensen for the work that he and his team have put into this masterpiece. It has changed this business owner forever."
3,NOT AT ALL SIMPLE,"While Bill has some very good ideas, this book is almost unreadable. Pages suddenly move from 12 pitch to 16 pitch to 20 pitch type, numbering is reversed to suit a point at will, double and triple line spaces come and go, bold type is spread here and there - it will give you glasses if you read it in one session.Secondly, while part of the title, no where does the concept of Competitibve Advantage get defined - Read Jay Barney ""Gaining and Sustaining Competitive Advantage"" Addison-Wesley 1997 to get a good start on what exactly you are looking for.Bill's core points are spread out over the 210 pages - if you cut out the quotes the book would be 25% shorter and much better for it.What he says is great - know exactly what you want to do, why you want to and what success will look like, and tell others in terms they can understand, and make sure they understand.I would suggest that you read someone elses copy before you think about purchasing this book. It's good but not great."
2,A book that needs better coherence,"I'm one of the many individuals who worked for large corporations before but recently switched to the fast moving internet startup environment. With the speed of the internet, better communications and team work is getting more important than ever.This is the reason I looked into this book. The book does offer some useful ways to simplify communications and corporate cultures, but all the paragraphs are not written in a cohesive manner, that I have a hard time following and apprecieting the book!Having read great business books written by authors like Tom Peters and Seth Godin, I'm used to the style of clean, coheresive, and interesting writing style.Didn't mean to give this book a 2 star while it receives great reviews from the other reader. But I'd like to be honest rather than conformative."
3,Would have made a great article.,This book had some good points but there was too much filler in between them.
2,"Disaponting, and not simple to read","I had great optomism when I picked up this book, caring much about simplicity at work and in product design. However I found this book did not live up to the title - the page layout and design is complex, heavy on semi-relevant, but not great, quotes and anecdotes from people other than the author. The book generates a great deal of models, buzzwords, and processes, that could be beneficial, but are definitely not simple to follow, or to put into practice. The study mentioned in the book, which might be great, is impossible to find on the website (http://www.simplerwork.com - claims the section is under construction)."
5,Solid Workout,"In this well-produced, fully-chaptered workout, Shari begins with a 5-minute warm-up and stretch, then leads two other exercisers through a 20-minute intermediate step workout (A-steps, V-steps, straddling the bench, knee lifts, etc.) She concludes the cardio portion of the workout with a five-minute cool down. This is followed by a great 20-minute all-over body toning routine (abs, triceps, glutes), then a five-minute stretch. I found the music to be motivating and the instructor warm and encouraging. All-in-all, this was a solid 45-minute workout!"
5,"""T.A. "" pants",I bought these TransAm pants for my daughter. She loves them for pajama bottoms. We're happy with them and the order was handled well.
5,Excellent book-shows the true significance of bar/bat mitzva,"This book should be read by every parent whose child is approaching bar/bat mitzvah. Too often, the significance of the occasion is lost in the ""big party"". This book focuses on what is important about the bar/bat mitzvah-about accepting responsibilities such as study and performing mitzvot, about the service and about keeping the celebration in perspective. It focuses on the spiritual as it should and helps pull away from the social aspects that often overwhelm the true meaning of bar/bat mitzvah."
5,Great guide for keeping things in perspective,"I got this book in preparation for my son's Bar Mitzvah, back in 2002. We had an interfaith family and crowd, and this was a great resource for highlighting the important points, and bringing everybody together to celebrate. It also helped me resist the pressure to have a huge, ostentatious shindig. We had a personal, warm, intimate affair, with a focus on the gravity of the event. My son got to experience the other style of celebration with his NY cousins, and while it was certainly fun, it was a little overwhelming. There are a few things in this book that have stuck with me to this day, which is why I was out here looking for the title, and decided to add my review."
4,Great product,Washer works great. Easy on the back and cleans large areas in a fraction of the time.
4,Excellent Driveway/Sidewalk cleaner,Previously it took me about 3.5 hours to clean my driveway. Now it takes just over an hour. But best of all my back doesn't hurt!!!
1,Only worth the 11 I paid for it....,"When I paid 11 for this book I thought I would only get 11 worth of information...now that I have finished the book I think I was correct.This book seems to have been put together by some one with no first hand knowledge, infact 3rd hand. Every topic is covered in an overview with no specific details, names of brands, costs, etc...which is the main reason most people buy this book. I believe this book could have been better if some one googled and compiled all the information."
1,I own a bar,Before I actually owned my bar I bought this book. This book is a joke and is good for laughs. I would suggest this book for someone who wants to work in the nightclub industry(bartender)but not for someone wanting to open their own bar. Its way too general and Id really feel sorry for any entrepreneur who used this book as a guidebook.
3,Just like your yearbook some good some bad,"Outkast reached the top with their 2cd issue anything else lives in its shadow only 2 songs popped for me Ms Jackson & ..World, maybe its an ATL thing, track 1 is grating after 2x."
3,not feelin' it,"not feelin' it with this....some good tracks...worth 14.99 not more. check out Southern Slang by D.O.W.N. a rap group from da dirty souf.....underground, not getting love from radio...but blowin' up retail"
5,THE PROPHET AND THE POET,"The Prophet and the Poet....the boys named Outkast. The way they spit their flows, the meaning in each word they speak, the way they put their songs together, every part of it I love. I'm glad that Andre3000 and Big Boi got together, they have a chemistry together that is unexplainable. Nothing compares to these boys, i hope their still making cd's when they are 60. I think my dream along with millions of others would be to meet these boys, who else would be a better pair to meet then the boys who even made a song with scooby doo?~! **MUCH LOVE TO OUTKAST, TO ANDRE3000 AND HIS DIFFERENT SENSE OF STYLE, AND TO BIG BOI THE MASTER OF HIS ART**"
2,trying to make $$ off of a greatest hits comp.,"If you're a true Outkast fan, you don't need this album, especially since the few new songs on it are mediocre at best; original, but don't display their true talent.This album is for the popheads that hopped on the Outkast bandwagon since ""Ms. Jackson""."
4,A Necessary Addition to the Oukast Collection,"Overall, an excellent collection, but too many tracks were included from Southernplayalistic. While those songs are quality, they are fairly standard hip-hop, especially when compared with the group's subsequent records. And why was the title track off ATLiens omitted? Inexplicable, especially since its listed among the liner notes. Guess you can't please everybody. As far as the new tracks go, none of them is particularly memorable. Funkin' Around and the After Party have strong jazz elements. The After Party seems like an afterthought best put on a B-side rather than an actual track. The raps in The Whole World are tight, especially Big Boi's, but what's up with Andre singing?! The hook is OK, but Dre's intro seems deliberately bad. Nonetheless, the album is a must for any Outkast fan."
4,good but doesne't have their best songs,"good but doesne't have their best songs on it, the album is missing Outkast's two best songs from ATLIENS ""Wheelz of Steel"" and ""Atliens"", so if you are new to Outkast go pick up the Atliens albums cause it is their best album."
4,A lot of songs left out,This album has most of Outkast's greatest hits. The only flaw I really see is they left off a lot of songs from ATliens. I understand they can't include every song in their catelogue but Atliens is by far the best album they released. Thats the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
4,Good Stuff,"I have Followed Outkast since they first dropped&they are a Interesting Group.I enjoy there Hits here&they all hold up still.I still dig there first Album the Best of all of there Albums but they keep you glued in.Outkast reminds Me of a Few Hip-Hop Acts somewhere Between Naughty By Nature,EPMD&a few others is where I Hear them."
3,Not Too Current,"This book covers the history of radio and tv well, but it really isn't too current with some of the new broadcasting standards and new research methods going on."
5,"Beautiful work, perhaps his best yet",Hauntingly beautiful work by Zucchero Fornaciari. The song Blue would be a huge hit in America if it had the right promotion--even if it weren't sung in English. This is wonderful songwriting!
5,"Zucchero, lo mejor de Italia","Este CD se lo recomiendo a toda la gente que le gusta cualquier tipo de musica. Musica que lo relaja y lo hace bailar, Zucchero sera siempre uno de los mejores musicos"
2,This was not what I thought,I was looking for more instruction but it fell short and probably is better suited for seniors and people with limited mobility.
1,Counterfit Chi Ceramic Round Brush,"I currently own a set of AUTHENTIC CHI round ceramic brushes. I bought the 1.5"", the 2.0"", and the 3.0"" CHI Round Ceramic Brushes from Omni Solutions. BUYER BEWARE, they are selling counterfit CHI round ceramic brushes for the authentic price. This is the worst experience I have had buying online. I am asking for a refund."
2,Too much like a college lecture,"This could have been a stunning documentary. Maybe the author should hire real film makers, or at the very least he could have utilized some film students to make this awesome subject appealing. Instead I feel asleep - TWICE - trying to watch it. If Dr. Moody decided to try again with more attention to the art of the documentary instead of basically lecturing into a camera lens, he'd hit GOLD!"
1,did not enjoy this,The content was very repetitive. The personal stories just weren't interesting enough to hold your attention. Raymond Moody is an expert in the field of death and the afterlife so I expected this to be better. I'd rather read his books instead.
2,A biased collection of testimonies.,"While certainly an interesting subject, it's unfortunate that the film does not go to any lengths to explore more opinions and studies. It serves mostly as a collection of testimonies from people who have had ""near death experiences"" and offers them as proof of an afterlife.I would have loved to see a more scientific approach with interviews by science and medical professionals. Perhaps not surprisingly, there was not even a mention of MacDougall's ""21 Grams"" study. It also would have been nice to get a historical perspective with some insight into the beliefs of different cultures.Overall this was a disappointing watch. It was obvious after the first fifteen minutes that the director already had an opinion on this and simply wanted to convince the audience to share his view. If you already believe in an afterlife and enjoy hearing people's tales of almost dying, you will probably enjoy this. If you are looking for any real insight on the subject, look elsewhere."
5,"A little gem, highly recommended","This programme was original shown during the afternoon by the BBC in the UK, but has subsequently be shown several more times during more ""peak"" viewing times, this was due to the great acclaim it received from critics and public alike. If you like British drama I would advise you to give this a try, I'm sure you will not regret it as it blends a good storyline with great acting and high production values. It accurately portrays the Welsh valleys of the time, (early 1960's), with both serious and comedic elements, very highly recommended."
4,Interesting Story,This is a good movie because of its interesting characters. Some of what takes place is not for younger kids and I could of passed on it myself.. But the story of the miners and what they faced in the mines and also the story of the Dr. and his wife coming all the way from India to practice medicine make for an interesting story line.
5,The Unlikely Spy,"This book, The Unlikely Spy, by Daniel Silva is brilliantly written and researched. I can not put it down. This is another winner from Amazon."
1,what a dull debut for such a great writer,"Silva's Gabriel Allon series are collectively, my favorite books. I've read the whole series through at least twice. So I thought I'd see where the author got his start and checked out The Unlikely Spy from my local library. I didn't even get through the first fifty pages, which is what I usually allow for a book to grab my interest. The beginning of the book is sufficiently boring to quash any interest in further reading, but I think for readers like myself, who discovered Silva during his brilliant Allon books, it's particularly disappointing to see the talent that would come along later that evidently wasn't there in the beginning. I guess it's not how you start..."
3,Great writing and story! Too much explicit sex for my taste.,"I have read a lot of Silva's Gabriel Allon books, so I thought this would be interesting. This book had a LOT more explicit and unnecessary sex. The Allon character books have a little, but leave more unsaid, which I prefer."
4,A fine WW II spy thriller,"This was my introduction to the work of Daniel Silva. I found the book very satisfying. As with any spy thriller, the narrative is filled with enough twists and turns to make you dizzy. The trick of alternating between the ""present"" and the ""history"" is carried off smoothly. I thought the multitude of characters, together with the flashbacks, would confuse me badly; it didn't. The progress of the plot was clear, without the mystifying vagueries that LeCarre used so effectively.The final unveiling of who-was-good-or-evil was a bit of a let-down, but the forward thrust of the narrative throughout was enough to make this a good read."
4,An engrossing thriller,"I won't attempt to summarize the plot of this great novel, as many other reviewers have done that already.What I will say is that this is one of the most exciting and cleverly written spy novels I have read in a long time. True, there is much that is familiar with other novels of this WWII genre, but the characters, historical placement, plot, scene descriptions, tension, conclusion, and wrap-up make this a book well worth your time. I think that Silva has done a wonderful job in painting a picture of wartime England and Germany, and you can almost feel yourself bumping around in the darkened streets of London.There are only a couple of places in the book where it seems that the good guys ""lucked out"", but that is a minor critique. The plot builds and moves through a series of intricate twists that rival the writings of other masters such as le Carre.A real page turner. I highly recommend it."
2,What??? What was this all about?,"This seemed like a great novel till I got to the end. I don't want to give away anything about the conclusion, but I felt like I had been had, by the way this story wrapped up in the last few pages. I wondered a quite a bit about the sense (or senselessness?) of the whole plot for quite a few hours after I was done reading this novel. Mr. Silva has certainly written far better works than this..."
3,The Unlikely Spy,"Not as suspenseful as Daniel Silva's other two books. The plot was not as good as his others, nor was the drama. Definitely not as well written as his other books."
2,Tedious,"This is a tedious, long drawn out book about a very old theme. Many times I thought to put the book away, not to finish it, but thought it might get deeper into the character of Catherine Blake. She could be great (though utterly ruthless) but her character could have been taken much further in this book. Instead, it concentrates too much on the rather stuffy Vicray who becomes progressively more tedious. All in all I don't consider this a very good book and it should in no way be compared to ""Fatherland"" as suggested on the jacket, since that story is truly fascinating. The Unlikey Spy is a repetition of a theme so old and repetitious that it really wasn't worth the time."
4,The Unlikely Spy,Very entertaining and well crafted. The plot twists and turns until te last page. Well worth the effort to read.
2,disappointed,I am a big fan if Silva and have read most of his books. The beginning was gruesome and really upset me so much that I skipped to the next chapter. The book being about Hitler and his buddies was too much. I got bogged down in all the discussions and kept wanting it to speed up. It was depressing!
3,Not as good as his others,This book was like reading the Mission Impossible series with so many twists and turns but not much of the action.I am a big fan of Silva's Allon series but found this one to be rather slow reading and no where near as entertaining. Still a good read for 7.99 but probably other books are better to spend the money on.
4,"Good read, great charcters, ending is so so","This is a good book with some great characters and a good plot. It is suspenseful but the ending was kind of a let down for me, hence only 4 stars. I'm not sure what I was expecting, just not what I got."
2,Too many different stories in this one book,"This book was really hard for me to get into. If you are like me and read a little and then dont pick a book up again for another few days, this one is too confusing. Just when you get to know a list of characters, the book starts a whole new story that is within the current story with all new characters. Also I felt there was just too much useless side information that was just filler. I am really busy and dont have much time to read so I want to be entertained (plus I have a horrible attention span).If you are the type of person who will read a book from start to finish without stopping this might be for you. But otherwise this is just too much info and too many characters."
1,Hans 4,"What a waste of time. Could have written the whole thing with half the words. It was fast reading, as I simply read the topic sentences in paragraphs and skipped the rest. In many case, I skipped whole paragraphs and didn't miss a thing.Obviously, Silva got his act together in later books, which I have read."
3,Early Daniel Silva somewhat wanting.,"Daniel Silva has learned a great deal since ""The Unlikely Spy.""The Gabriel Allon series is brilliant and, for me, virtually seemless writing.The unlikely spy, on the other hand, required more suspension of disbeliefthan I could possibly muster. My compliments to the author in any case, andI eagerly await Allon's next appearance."
3,Daniel Silva -,"Daniel Silva is a most intriguing author and a great story teller. His Gabriel Allon series are terrific and I have read the first seven in the series. I am now reading ""Moscow Rules"" and Can't put it down.I have not purchased any books as yet on my Kindle Fire HD. Maybe soon!Josephine Trotta Poliner"
5,Well written,This book is a well written novel about spies. I thought it was exciting and it kept my attention the whole time. I was always eager to read it.
5,Good Book,"Alfred Vivers works in ""A rather dull office of the war ministry"" at least that is what he has to tell everyone.In fact it is his job to safeguard one of the most vital secrets of the second world war just exactly where the troops are going to land. Not to mention the artificial harbors that are being constructed. A sleeper agent that has been in England since the 30's seeks to jeopardize all that. Now he must race against the clock to find the agent before she escapes England and reaches safety in Germany.The suspense level makes this a thoroughly enjoyable book."
5,A RARE MASTERPICE WRITTEN BY THE MASTER,"Daniel Silva is one of those rare writers out there that write such a powerful novel as this. It caught my attention here on amazon and I ended up reading it in one weekend. I've been looking for a novel of Double Crossing, Spying, and War Behind the Lines like this for almost forever. Finally Daniel Silva has done it! A true masterpiece!"
3,Good WWII spy novel- based on historical facts,"This was Daniel Silva's first novel and it shows how far he has come since then. It is well written, but not evenly paced- plodding at times. When you compare it with ""Messenger"" Silva's ability clearly shines and has developed dramatically. They truely are incomparable!I read this book and almost quit reading his books, but a friend encouraged me to try one of his Allon, character books. So I read on and am glad that I did.Don't get me wrong this is not a bad book! There are interesting twists within his tale but it won't keep you on the edge like his later works. I would go so far as to say don't judge Silva's talent on this book because it would be woefully understated. You really need to get to his Allon books to truely see what a wonderful wordsmith he is."
5,Excellent WWII Thriller,"Great first effort by Daniel Silva. Atmospheric, intriguing and fast paced. It takes you back in time and allows you to get a first hand feeling of life in Europe in the 1940s during war times. Someone mentioned this book is a clone of Ken Follet's ""Eye of the Needle""; maybe so, but it stands on its own.If you like World War II espionage thrillers pick up this one and enjoy the ride!"
3,"Good book, 3.5 stars could have been a 5 star!!","I have become a huge Daniel Silva fan, and that grows with every book I read by him.This book is long (a tad too long), and hence is not up to the typical pace of Daniel Silva but still very interesting and entertaining. I think the book would have had better pace and drama minus 100 pages of supporting characters person relationships and dialog that just slowed it down; in fact, I think the book would have been better split into two books. Book one could have been about the early years with Alfred Vicary and how he found his first spy and set up the double spy network to feed the Germans false information (which was alluded to, not explored in detail in this book). Then the second book could deal with the ""Unlikely Spy"" and both books could have been exciting page turners."
3,WWII Suspense,"This novel follows the formula of many WWII thrillers, sometimes a little too closely. It is predictable and the characters are unremarkable. Any of them could be found in hundreds of other novels of every genre.It does hold the reader in suspense and becomes quite compelling at points, but beings to mire itself down toward the end and then ends in something of an anti-climax, and a predictable one at that.There are good twists and turns and it is a worth while read. I did enjoy it, but was less than impressed. If you enjoy Ken Follett's early WWII era work, you will enjoy this novel."
5,wonderful book to TV adaptations and Poirot by Suchet-perfection,"Any POIROT set is just plain GOOD murder mystery. Agatha Christie suspense perfect. David Suchet acting excellence. Combined they make any British Mystery viewer salivate. Add top guest stars in each, SUBTITLES for the hearing and dialect challenged, and kick in some of the best filmed period mystery ever produced. It's what fans have come to expect with Poirot, Agatha Christie, Masterpiece Mystery, and the untouchable as Hercule Poirot--David Suchet.The Blu-rays and new DVDs are newly remastered and restored to their original U.K. broadcast order. This is wonderful mystery TV, never to get out of date. You WILL love every episode."
5,great benefit of Amazon Prime,I can't get enough of David Suchet as Poirot. I joined prime and can watch him for free. Well worth the price of Prime. Great series and two is very good.
5,Live in simpler times,What a pleasure it is to pop in a David Suchet Poirot and be transported back to life in simpler times.Especially in Blue-Ray...
5,"great one bit of a spoiler, but just a tiny one ))","ive been watching all these old Agatha christie's and i have got to say this Poirot is absolutely the best yet. the oh so modest Poirot had me rolling with tears when he was trying to get Hastings to say what a detective extrodinaire he was LOL and hastings says tell her yourself... then Poirot says something about his modesty.. i had to rewind and play it again, He just makes me Happy ... i think he was smitten with the young lady... i never get tired of David Suchet.... to me he IS Poirot"
5,fan since more than 20 years!,"As I have been a fan since more than 20 years, I cannot really be that objective. I loved watching Poirot when I was a child (11-12 years old) and I still love it. It's so timeless."
1,Received Used,I ordered this toy and I thought it looked like it wasn't in very good shape when I removed it from the Amazon box. It didn't come in its own box or have instructions like all toys do. I turned it over and it had another child's name on it. I was supposed to be purchasing a NEW toy. I was appalled.
4,Makes you think.,"The documentary certainly looks down on the subjects. The rave guy who acts like he knows so much, actually is so clueless he doesnt know the name of the date rape drug. The research by the members of the church is horrible. The film is gritty (both in subject and lighting) and some scenes had no relevence (dating & football matches?) Watching the film a few things popped into my mind 1) where is the scene with the abortion doctor murderer. 2)I hope none of the people ever get raped or depressed. Arogance at it's best"
1,Not Sure What to Say...,"It's bad enough that anyone would re-create acts of violence and despair as a means to scare people toward religion, but to do it with such heedless aplomb--as the good 'ol folks behind the production of Hell House seem to--is downright disturbing. Neither a good film nor a bad one. A chronicle and nothing more, so stars become meaningless. You'll either be elated and filled with the holy spirit, or lose your lunch; there's no in-between. Vile stuff."
5,These people are scary,Really. There is something wrong with the notion that religion needs a hell or there would be no good reason to go to heaven. A compelling and objective work. This DVD is a must see.
5,Dependable,"Power was out for 4 days. Little generator started on 1st pull. Ran TV, Lights and laptop without problems. Originally bought for camping."
5,Make it a Winning Life Perpetual Calendar,This calendar is the best I have seen. Very inspiring and fun to read. I look forward to flipping to the next page each morning and implimenting the Action Steps. Dr. Rinke's wisdom has made a big difference in my life with this calendar.
1,Works fine but cant use the built-in flash,"Keep in mind that you can't use this product unless you buy an external flash.

5,"Great designer, ok book.","I bought this book after getting Susan Sargent's other book titled ""The comfort of color"", which I absolutely love and HIGHLY recommend, if you like her bright color palate. This book is not as great, it doesn't have near as many pictures and there is a lot of writing, which is fine, but if your looking for visual inspiration, this book is only OK. I much prefer her other book."
4,Not as colorful as the next book,"I read the second book first - this one looks quite colorless in comparison. It does give you some practical ideas of how to paint stripes, outdoor furniture, floors, etc.Ispired by Susan I already colored my walls very warm orange and I love it. I guess now i can color bookcase purple to make it even more playful."
3,COLOR COLOR,"If you are not afraid of color and painting this book is for you.This book is more about the author with quotes from famous artists and designers. There are how-to's but they are pretty basic, just like the book."
2,color cartridge...,it only lasted for about 6 printings ...so disappointing I discarded machine and brought another onehave since heard of printer not used the cartridges dry up -
3,Pre-use Review,This cartridge was ordered as a back - up for a new printer. The cartridge has not been used yet. Next purchase will be from local stores - the packing/postage costs outweigh the convenience of ordering on line.
2,it does not printi good picture,"Normally this is a great help. I am handicapped and shopping online is a tremendous advantage, but this time I was disappointed. The ink is light and won't print a clear vivid picture. I have a new grandson and can't get one good picture printed."
1,HP ink cartridge,I ordered a new cartridge & received a used cartridge. used it because at the time I needed it to complete my work. In the future I will not deal with the company that supplied it. My printer recognized it as not an original HP product & does not show the ink levels.
2,"Bao Bei won't harm your child, but won't help much either","Yes the children are cute and multi-racial but I just feel like for the money you are getting very little quality language instruction. I've been teaching my daughter Mandarin since she was 6 mos. (she is now 2.5) and I have all of these videos but I am not impressed. They will keep your little one busy with a lot of eye candy. They could put about twice as much instruction, and better instruction in each video. At one point the puppet starts talking, in English of course, about something off the direct topic. It's really annoying because the dvd is only 30 minutes long. Again I will close my rant with the fact that these DVDs won't hurt anything if you can afford them. Given what else is out there, you may as well add them to your Chinese language tool box."
5,Great backpack for a small woman!,"My twelve-year-old used this backpack on a recent vacation, and it was perfect for her. Plenty of pockets, comfortable fit, good capacity. It did take us a long while to locate the emergency whistle! (It's on the buckle of the sternum strap.)"
3,I was expecting literally 100s of activities. Where are they?,"According to publisher's notes, there are ""100s of the best award-winning activities, games and crafts"" in this book. There are just over 100. And not like what I had hoped for. Still good stuff, but just not at the caliber of some of the TV episodes of Donna I had recently seen. That's why I'm only giving it 3 stars -- it did not deliver on the promise."
3,Works perfect...,"Added two of them, with other two 1 GB to run my Vista 32 bits version. Perfect fit and price."
4,Good basic grammar book!,I use this as a supplementary text in my Spanish IV classes to reinforce grammar concepts. It has it all and good practices to go with it! And this is the smaller format. It's easy for students to lug around with them.
4,"Margaret, Australia","I have read all of The Roselynde Chronicles, and Rhiannon lives up to all the other books. Ms Gellis weaves a wonderful story of a family, supplies history, romance etc etc. She is very detailed with her describitions, it is like watching a movie."
5,Love the whole series,Once I started reading them I could'nt wait to get the next book. Have been reading other books lately but will soon be on to the next in the series. the author does a great job of carring the stories from one book to another. Love the history and the fiction. Great job
5,Realization of Divine cool breeze from the Divine source,"hello, all the lucky truth seekers,it is my great pleasure to express the heartful gratitude to the writer of this book - Shri Mataji.on the topics of religion and the subtle system , there are a plenty of divine insights and brilliant ideas.when we start the practice of Sahaja Yoga, with pure desire, we can easily feel the Mother energy within our body. there is a re-union of the human energy with the universal energy. you can feel the love & light from the universe and you can become the great witness of God.we can feel the love, the joy and peace within our body.this is something you can practice and you ,like a scientist, can do the experiment on ""self-intergration with universe"" via your body.i joyfully invite you all to open your heart to receive the gift from the God and Universe.love and light"
1,"simple fact about book, its rating and its reviews","The author of this book is the founder of a religious cult and is worshipped as the Holy Ghost, the Supreme Goddess, by her devotees. Messages have been sent out within her cult telling her followers to come here and give 5 star reviews to drown out any criticism. Thus you can take the rating for this book with a pinch of salt. I've tried reading the book but I find it very boring. I'm also surprised at the $50 price tag but I guess the Goddess needs her royalties from it to supplement the millions of dollars per annum she scams from her followers. The book basically slags off the West and says how great India is. Of course the only answer is for everyone to join the author's cult and worship and enrich her."
5,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,"I would say this book is a wake up call for us in the 21st century. One does not have to spiritually inclined to see the sense behind Shri Mataji's words. We can all see the things she that she talks about around us every day or throughout our history. We even complain about such things and wonder how is it all going to end.This is a book one can delve into again and again and it will still reveal some fresh insight.This book is a must for the book shelf or even better the bedside cabinet. Just open it at any page at the end of the day and there will be something inspirational, thought provoking or deeply spiritual which will make you want to think again about the lives we are leading and where it is taking us as human beings.Is there another way and what is our purpose as human beings on this earth?"
1,Sahaja Yoga is a dangerous cult,"Sahaja Yoga is a dangerous cult, as you may well find out if you check the Internet and read what experts have to say about it. This book is a dangerous weapon, as many others the cult has. It separates victims from their families, it has rules about arranged marriages, it claims that people shouldn't go to be treated by doctors, it claims that it can cure AIDS, cancer and so on. I've read the book and, besides it's terrible mistakes and the ignorance of the so called godess, it would be important that authorities should take this subject in their hands. They should check where the money of this cult goes and what happens to the ones who dare criticize it.Shame on the Sahaja Yoga cult!"
2,Guru are not clever than us,"I enter in sahajayoga, to learn about mediation. I learnt about the shep/shepherd social modele which is the base of christianity and totalitarian organisation. The book shows us the point of view of an old indian lady who live in Europe. There is nothing bright, valuable or intelligent.Take any old indian ladies living in Europe, asks her to write a book about the world and you will get a similar book with similar views.It is a prrof that religious leadership is never the result of the brightness of the view of the leader but rather is capabilkities to hold the herd."
5,A new paradigm,"This amazing book presents a paradigm shift in human consciousness. It shows how we are able to overcome the limitations of our current materialistic orientation and replace these with a new enlightened awareness which enables a deep peace, joy and love."
5,A family book!,"In the multitude of books you can buy, a good book is the one that helps us, our family, our children. And Meta Modern Era is one of the kind. It respecs the values of the society, of the human nature. It is a book that makes you feel proud when read it or lend the book to someone else. So dear buyer, that kind of books makes your bookshelf look golden."
5,Amasing world of new awareness from the Greatest Master.,"This book is about New Awareness, which can be acheived by every seeker of truth trought Self Realization. It is written by Highly Spiritual Personality who spends all Her power and attention to spread all over the world the message of Divine solution for all of us.

Everything is so simple and what we are looking for is inside us, and she tell us how to get it in a very simple manner, without any effort. It's just there!"
5,Best of the Best paths to seeking your self.,"Excellant Book, August 16, 2004Reviewer: Mohan Chavan ""mohan"" (USA) - See all my reviewsThis book is excellant picture of current culture and its problems. Also it suggests the wondeful, scientifically proven solution to fight the third world problems. Following the solution has deeply changed my life and has tought me how to deal with the problems of daily life. The technique tought in the book just take 10 minutes of your day. Give it a try as we try so many things in the world, for experience is the best master.I recommend everyone to have one copy and try the solution mentioned. For more details see www.sahajayoga.org"
5,Silent revolution in human conscious awareness.,"I can thoroughly recommend Meta Modern Era to anyone who has ever picked up the morning newspapers to read more bad news about things going wrong in social, economic and political life; and wondered to themselves,'where is it all headed?'.There's a mountain of conventional books about the problems that beset society today, but rarely, if ever , has a book described how the solution lies in a literal transformation of human consciousness at the individual level. It is this hypothesis that makes Meta Modern Era a very unconventional book and one which is an absolute must-read."
5,REAL HOPE!,"Wonderful! Finally a Breath of fresh air in the stuffy room of New Age theories - in fact, more than just a theory as Her Holiness Shri Mataji seems capable of actually delivering the goods!"
5,A Must Read for a True Seeker,"If you are a True Seeker then this Book from Her Highness Nirmala Devi is a must read. This book not only tells the problems we are facing but also the solutions. Till date everybody talked of meditation but no one told what actually it is and how to do it. Truly She has told that Thoughtless Awareness is the first step to the Road of Self-Knowledge.While reading this book you feel like someone your very own is talking to you for your benevolence. Also even though the topic is very subtle, She has used very simple language to make the topic look very understandable. Even Her photograph on the cover is very attractive.Could be a good gift to your spiritually minded friends."
2,Beware of poor sound quality!!,"Don't buy this CD!! The sound quality of the tracks are bad,done on a $19.95 tape recorder from Radio Shack."
1,ripped off,"Bought this center link and tie rod ends for my Grand Cherokee. Everything was fine until the center link arrived today. The box was opened and the plastic bolt bags were ripped open and the bolts removed. The brackets were left loose in the box with the bags. These bolts are designed to specifically fit these brackets. These are not bolts you can just run down to the hardware store and buy. It appears that Amazon has a thief in their organization, and worst of all there is no way to contact Amazon. You have one option it seems...return and start again, other wise I cold have spoken to someone and resolved this without having to write this..."
3,Decent Flick,"But not as good as the first one. Explains more about why the house in Questa Verde' was haunted. Adds a bit more to the storyline, but I think they were kinda reaching for straws here. The best thing about this movie is the special effects designed bu H.R. Geiger."
2,A good introduction to the HUNA philosophy and psychology,"After reading this authors later work ""Totems: The Tranformational Powe Of Your Personal Animal Totem"" I was expecting great things from this volume.To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. I had read most of this material in Max Freedom Long's (The Father of Current HUNA as we understand it.)volumes. The case reports in this volume are direct word for word copies of a small number of the case reports from ""The Secret Science Behind Miracles"" Max Freedom Long.I would recommend for you to buy ""The Secret Science Behind Miracles"", and ""The Secret Science At Work"" instead.Please E-Mail me if you have questions or comments about this review.

4,"Very good, but no great.......","This set is really good, but it could be great.Pros: great detail in a 80 %, awesome looks that kill.Cons: Vince's and Tommy's faces are not that similar to real characters as Nikki's and Mick's, no lights (sorry, but that could have been great) and at the bottom of the stage looks like they were thinking in putting some sound (there is a place for batteries with no wires and a hidden speaker) but there is not.In conclusion, I love my Motley Crue Box Set, I've been always a fan and I give 4 out 5 stars because of the cons explained above. Buy it anyway, but this set could have been great."
5,Unique cooler use,"My boat came with a large cooler under the seat, behind the console. I did not need this much cooler space for food so I was looking for a vertical cooler about 1/2 the size, so I could store a 5 gallon bucket under my seat, too.These are almost impossible to find in a retail store because they, understandibly, want to stock vertical coolers that have wheels and pop-up handles. I measured my space and started to look for a cooler that fit these dimensions. This one fit perfectly !"
1,A Real One-Of-A-Kind,I hope this is the only ice chest in the world without a drain plug. I have to siphon out the water!
5,USA built,"A first class product that proudly declares ""Made in the USA"", this cooler has zero odor, unlike coolers made in China, some of which are required to carry a warning label and which still stink after months of being outside in the sun and fresh air!It has great capacity, is easy to handle and store. We love it!"
3,Charlemagne,"This book by Winstonm doesn't as much state opinions as facts, he uses only good sources and the writings of Charlemagne's biogapher Reinhard to bring the realty of this great man to life."
4,Great historical photos,"This book is out of print and contains great old photos of the ghost towns when they were in their heyday as well as some photos taken of the towns after they became ghosts. Interesting stories relate to each of the 22 towns, along with a map of where they are located."
5,A Thriller with Heart,"Shikar will not only scare you into battening down all your hatches, but will also touch you emotionally. For me, the heart of the book was the complex relationship the child - Roy Satterly - had with both the tiger and the hunter. The climax is as thrilling - and as touching - as any book I've read."
5,Really Good Read,"I did not think I would like a book about a tiger loose in Georgia. Boy, was I wrong. This story sucks you in and you want to keep reading.A year or so ago the SciFi Channel made a pathetic movie that was obviously based on this book. But as bad as the movie was, the book is great.I would advise anyone who likes high suspense and action to read this book."
3,HELP!,"I was about to buy this because of all the 5 star ratings, but the last one with the one star talking about the 40 some games made me skeptical. I just want to know if it has Diablo and Diablo 2 cheats before buying it, and if so what are they? Will anyone who owns it answer, PLEASE."
2,Good For Old Games ONLY,This Gameshark Is Useless For Current Games.Because It Was Made By Interact.Plus Interact No Longer Makes Gamesharks.Mad Catz Makes Gamesharks .Now There Is No Way To Update It Because Mad Catz Does Not Support The Older Gamesharks.So Don 't Waste Your Time On This Gameshark If You Hope It Will Have Cheats For New Games.Like GTA Liberty City Storys.
5,GREAT,"This is so great. Now its the fun of your video-game gameshark, on your PC! Use this with unbeatable games, or for the fun of it go head to head with some people in Quake 3, using god mode!"
1,...,"I bought this thinking it was going to have AT LEAST 1,000 games in it, and AT LEAST 5,000 cheats. But I was wrong, it had 43 games in it and around 77 cheats in it ONLY! ..."
5,Britney's Best,I have been a Britney fan since her first cd. I really think this is her best it.The songs are ALL great and don't get old like some previos Britney songs. Also the the booklet to the cd has some very [good] shots of Britney.All you people who think Britney is fading you are wrong I mean come on look at Madonna. If you like other Britney stuff you should definatly buy it.
2,CONTRIVED AND GENERIC,"~Britney Spears' third album ""Britney"" is supposed to bethe teen queen's ""grown-up"" effort-distancing herself from thekiddie-friendly Max Martin crafted Swede-pop and delving intobetter material and hotter topics.And although ""Britney"" iscrafted to be that,it's merely a misfire.Shaped out to be Spears' version of Janet Jackson's ""Control"",""Britney"" finds Spears' singing sexyPrince-inspired jams like the Neptunes produced ""I'm A Slave 4 U""With it's a~~ haughty,Vanity 6-like vibe,the track turns out tobe ""Britney""'s one gem.The Neptunes' other track ""Boys"" isfaux-Janet funk.Max Martin chips in five sound-a-like songsand Rodney Jerkins contributes a decent update of Joan Jett's1982 classic ""I Love Rock N Roll"".All in all,Britney Spears is headed to Debbie Gibson/TiffanyVille.A place where manufactured teen stars spend the last days of their fallen carrers.~"
1,The horror!,"This CD is definitely not worth purchasing. The first track contains cursing and phrases with inappropriate meanings, as well as other tracks in the album, which is a poor example to her underage fans. I am disappointed at how someone who probably once was a well-behaved child could turn into such a yucky person. Another reason, which is the main reason why I am writing this, is because it caused my CD player to malfunction, to be more specific, practically explode. It had worked perfectly until I inserted this CD in it. So in conclusion, I advise you all not to buy ""Britney"". Spend your money on something more worthwhile, such as Charlotte Church's ""Enchantment""."
1,talantless,"thanks for nothing, britney has been polluting our airwaves for years and has to be stopped.please someone STOP BRITNEYbob_chicken"
1,A comment about 1crazy_sexy_cool1's review,"YOU SAID IN YOUR REVIEW:""Britney's real voice sounds alot more stronger, the exact opposite of what some of you said. Don't you hear it's computerized? God. You can hear Britney's best vocals on her first 2 albums""NOW, YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY A FAN, SO I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE YOU BUT THIS GIRL CANNOT SING. SHE'S PRETTY AND WILL SING WHATEVER IS PUT IN FRONT OF HER. THAT'S IT. IF THEY'RE ALREADY BRING IN THE PITCH CORRECTOR AFTER TWO ALBUMS, THAT SHOULD BE A SIGN.""MATURE MUSIC"" IS MUSIC THAT IS CAREFULLY CRAFTED, WELL WRITTEN AND ORIGINAL SOUNDING. WHEN YOU MATURE, YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN. YOU COULD PUT THIS BRITTANY ALBUM IN WITH A CHRISTINA AGUILERA ALBUM AND I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHICH IS WHICH."
1,what a joke,"You're kidding me, right? THIS IS NOT MUSIC PEOPLE!!! She is some corporate created no talented girl who has to push her[self] in everyones face to stay in the spotlight. This album is a waste of money. There is not an ounce of vocal talent on the entire album. Yes, Britney is beautiful. But who cares? There are a ton of beautiful girls out there..."
3,Back in the Day : Three Stars,"This could well be Miss Spears' best album. Listening to tracks from this, its a pity that it all went downhill after this. The standout is obviously ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", easily the best thing Britney has put to record. But there are other gems here as well.""Not a Girl, Not yet a Woman"" is a tad sappy indeed, but it holds up well years later. The same cannot be said for the tired version of ""I love Rock and Roll"", which is beyond bad. However, for every sick track on this, there is a bonafide gem - ""Lonely"" and ""Anticipating"" are songs that make this record a must-have.The last three songs on the CD are what reduces it to a three star album. Typical of a Spears release, the tracks are pure filler and sound like they're from the early 1990s. Not a good thing.Still, for what its worth, this was the last Britney album that actually has some repeat value, so you might want to check it out for that novelty value."
4,awesome music,I love this album by Britney. Lost of great music. The whole album makes you want to dance. If ypu like Pop music this is the album for you.
2,Not a good album at all,There are only 2 good songs on this album and the rest are just crap. At least it is better than ''In The Zone''. That one is just crap.
2,Sex Music!?,"THis whole album seemed to me to be more about Britney showing off her skin instead of her actually singing. Don't get me wrong, Britney Spears has a nice body but that shouldn't be the reason why people buy a CD it should be because that person could sing and has good songs, which this album has neither. Or any Britney CD's have"
1,I Admit I Bought This CD,"I never really was a Britney Spears fan but I bought this CD because I had heard several songs and really liked them. After hearing the whole entire CD, I realized I had wasted my money. Most of the songs have the same beat, and her cover of ""I Love Rock & Roll"" sucks, and the songs that were somewhat good got old fast. If your a pop music fan you will probably like this CD, but other then that most people won't like it."
5,All Britney fans must have!,"This CD is the 14 track Australian Import version of the US 12 track Britney CD. It includes two songs not on the US version: ""When I found You"" and ""Before the Goodbye."" These are two of my favorite songs on the CD and definitely should've been included on the US version of the CD and everytime I listen to them I can't figure out why they weren't included. ""When I Found You"" is a beautiful ballad.The song ""Before The Goodbye"" reminds me of N'SYNC's ""Gone"" at the beginning. The rest of the song sounds like a Destiny's Child type of song-it's got slower parts and faster dance music parts. It's a great song. This CD is a must have for any true Britney fan."
5,Britney Rocks!,"Why are people dissin Ms.Spears? This record is great! It's not all bubble gum pop - it's a whole buncha stuff mixed together. Personally, I think this has to be one of my favorite albums. Maybe it's just because I'm a music lover and I listen to everything, but hey, give Britney some credit. There are a lot of good dance tracks on here...a few songs with an ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" vibe, a few songs that sound like her old ones, and a few totally different ones. I mean, she even co-writes a few songs. I'm proud of the girl. This is a milestone in Britney history! I don't know WHY people are putting this album into question...I love it. Her vocals aren't as strong as they could be but the songs don't really call for high notes. Britney isn't Diana Ross...She's Britney and she does her own thing. 13 good tracks n it doesn't even cost a lot. Sound like a deal to you? Well, all I have to say is...GO OUT AND BUY THE ALBUM IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!!!!!!!"
5,Amazing pop album.,"This is Britney's best album yet. She mixes a completely new sound with bubble gum pop to make music that you'd only expect from Britney. Britney's ballads are always amazing, but Not a Girl, Not Yet a Women is possibly the best song that she has ever recorded. Britney definitely shows off her lyrical talents throughout the CD. All of the dance songs are unique in their own way; this is a CD that every pop fan should add to their collection. I myself am sick and tired of hearing popstars claims that they have ""reinvented"" their sounds on their newest albums, but Britney without-a-doubt transformed her sound into something new, as promised."
3,"good, but not the best","britneys 3rd cd has some well done tracks. like ""slave 4 u"" and ""not a girl,not yet awoman"". her voice hasant really changed, however some of the songs bring out the best in it, for what it is. ""slave 4 u"" is a exceptionally good song, with its more jungle feel. ""oops i did it again"" album is my personal favorite, it contains britneys typical style and sound, but maybe if she tried writng some more of her own songs this cd would be better? i dont know, but this cd is a little confusing. Its good though, we have here something a little different from Britney, and its really not that bad. I would not buy the cd, but get the singles, they are more worth it."
5,Exceptional Album,"I thought this album was stupendous. It shows Britney has evolved from a girl to a mature women. The songs are very meaningful. Like, ""overprotected"" it shows independence and ""let me be"" to me shows growing up. I think she has an astounding voice and a great career ahead of her. I can't wait until her next album. All the songs have a special message. Don't miss out get this record right away."
1,Painful to listen to.,"I honestly believe that playing an artist like Britney Spears can increase your ability to play a game like Zuma. (It's a theory I'm testing out, do not ask.) Of the three albums I have heard from Britney (this, In the Zone, and Oops! I Did It Again), this is the most painful to listen to, despite producing efforts from the Neptunes on songs such as ""I'm a Slave 4 U."" (IMO, I like the beat, but Britney's singing is terrible on this track.) Of all the songs on this album (including that lovely end duet with Justin Timberlake), the songs triumphantly featured on the terrible movie ""Crossroads"" are the worst: my least favorite song, Britney's cover of ""I Love Rock and Roll,"" had me longing for Joan Jett's more anarchic rendition (and remember, this song was not performed for a bunch of karaoke patrons like in the movie). If you want to start listening to Britney Spears, this is not the album to start with."
2,...,"Ok. This is the poorest album I've ever heard! Pop is out nowadays, and Britney can't change from pop to some other genre. There's just no point. Here's my song-by-song review:I'M A SLAVE 4 U --- 3/10OVERPROTECTED --- 5/10LONELY --- 4/10I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN --- 1/10BOYS --- 1/10ANTICIPATING --- 0/10I LOVE ROCK N ROLL --- 6/10CINDERELLA --- 4/10LET ME BE --- 2/10BOMBASTIC LOVE --- 2/10THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME --- 3/10WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME --- 5/10Average...3/10 Poor"
5,Eralys's fauvorites singers,"I like very much this kind of songs, but i wish to know how i can get its"
4,it's a fun album...,"It is a nice put together album, like many have commented though it does seem like a technically produced album, including Britney. You're not able to hear HER, like the music is drowning her out on some songs.Having said that though, the album is a fun album. I bought the album not really looking for VOICE from Britney Spears but for FUN. And in my opinion, that's what I got.I don't understand why people give her a hard time, I remember Madonna and Janet starting out the same way-and still continue success and neither of them have a great voice either and look at where both of them are!! Britney, I think will be around as long as Madonna and Janet has."
3,The Girl We Love To Hate Is Back,"This album is typical and the songs are all stuff we'd expect from her. But isn't that what we love about Britney, the fluff, the corn, the predicitability. I must admit, the Neptunes did Britney a huge favor by making ""Slave 4 U"" I hated her until I heard that song...Also, I'm feeling the summer song ""Anticipating"" and ""Lonely."" Do I recommend this album? Well, no. Burn only those songs I mentioned because the rest of the album I don't care too much for. Save money."
3,What do you expect?,"Although this album is pretty bad, it's a good effort for Britney. We were promised before the album came out that it'd be totally different, which (with the exception of 2 songs ""Boys"" and ""Slave 4 U"") is a big joke. It's solid pop, which isn't dreadful but neither is it great. If you're into pop music, you'll adore it, but I can only find 5 songs which are any where near a high standard."
5,The best from the best,"Put quite simply, this is the best pop CD released in a very long time. If you like R&B, Pop, or Rock, this is a CD for you. All the songs are fantastic!"
2,ugh it's horrible,the only ok songs are the neptunes ones I'm a slave and boys but her voice ruined them. Not a girl not yet a woman is a nice ballad but her voice once again ruined it. The rest is horrible.
3,A solid pop disc that takes some chances,"Britney Spears' third release takes some risks and that's more than most pop artists do. The sultry first single ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" is a hot song and thanks to Pharrell, it's one of Britney's best tracks ever recorded. However, much of the album falls back into the generic recordings that Britney has become accustomed to.""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" is pure cheese and ""Overprotected"" is an irritating and overproduced dance track. ""Let Me Be"" is pop trite and Britney should really be ashamed of her dreadful cover of ""I Love Rock N Roll.""But there's some bright spots on this record. ""Lonely"" is a take-no-crap pop anthem that should have been a radio hit. ""Boys"" is a hot dance track, similar to ""Slave"" thanks again to the Neptunes. ""That's Where You Take Me"" is light and surprisingly decent and ""What It's Like To Be Me"" is perhaps Britney's most personal song to date.Overall, an album with good and bad, but the good ultimately prevails."
4,Not bad,"CD REVIEW:The CD contains 12 tracks (...). Some of the songs on the CD are not bad. I like tracks numbers 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11.The CD is an enhanced CD, which means if you put the CD into your CD-Rom drive, there is a video you can play. The video shows a footage of Britney singing ""Overprotected""; in this video, you can see clips from her first career movie.What I don't like about the CD is that there are no lyrics to the songs. Her first CD, ""...Baby One More Time"", had lyrics (I don't know about the second one, ""OOPS!.. I Did it Again"", because I never bought it) but not this CD. There is a pull-out poster included, but it's small--not too small, but still small.Overall, the CD is a great improvement from her debut CD."
1,repetitive,"This album sounds exactly the same from beginning to end. As usual, another Britney album for mass consumption by people with who are not picky about their music. Waste of money. It was given to me as a gift and I gave it a try. I traded it in for a Cyndi Lauper album. I bought the Shine LP. Now there is an artist with talent!!!"
1,Go Away Britney,"Has anyone noticed that she can't even spell ""Brittany"" right?How many record company executives does it take to post fake 5 star reviews?I really don't believe that this many people still like this no-talent waste of marketing."
2,I didn't really like this album,britney's voice was alright with the first album but it was in decline since then though the music on oops wasn't that bad. But when I heard slave 4 u and how britney claimed she feels its the best song she's ever written I was very disappointed and hated everything about the beat and the lack of melody in it. That song grew on me though and I appreciate it for what it has to offer. Boys and Lonely are the only other good songs here and I'm Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman is cute though the voice really sucks and the music is nice. This album overall is a hot mess though and britney's voice is at her worst especially on the song cinderella. Check out In the Zone and Oops if you want to hear alright music from britney but don't expect a good voice
3,Her first two album recycled again..,"Talk about someone who knows how to ruin a song.Her remake of ""I Love Rock N Roll"" has two be the worst remake in history.Joan Jetts growls have been reduced to moans by Britney.The rest of the music is just her forst two albums recycled into an over blown mess.""Im a Slave For You""Is a complete (...) of ""Nasty Girl"" by Vanity 6.Could this be the end of Britney?If she continues to churn out music like this,we can say so.Nice try Brit,better luck next time."
2,A slave for you..........with a bad voice and no personality,"I received a leaked copy of this album and was very disappointed with it. Other than the single ""Slave 4 U"", I really only liked a couple of the songs. I am a fan of pop music, but I'm just not feeling this album. There's very little substance, just more nonsensical video friendly spewing. ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" is an interesting choice for a cover, and it works well in this case. I also like the song ""Bombastic Love"", which features great production. Overall this album is more of the same, so I can only recommend it to people who already like Brintey Spears."
1,STOP!!!!!!,"For the love of God, please stop making records, Brit. You have no talent what so ever and your sending a message to girls that in order to recognized, all you need is to be good looking. To those who are buying her ""records"", STOP IT!!! If it weren't for people like you, she would have disappeard a long time ago. Instead of wasting your money on crap like this, support real artists who can write their own music and are about music. Honestly, this must end."
5,A great CD from beginning to end,"Britney is back and better than ever! I could say stuff like she ""did it again"" or ""one more time"" but thats kinda getting old now. When you forget about her sexy image and the bad rap she constantly receives, this is just straight up fun music! There are so many people in this world who can't deal with their own insecurities so they choose to Britney-bash. Everyone I've talked to has seemed to like this CD. Even people I know who don't really approve of Brintey's sexy image have admitted to me that they can't resist this album. Britney shows major growth with this album and co-wrote many of the tracks, so that is one less thing people can criticize her for. I think people need to realize that Britney isn't here to degrade women or destroy music. On the contrary, she is making great music that is heating up the clubs and I believe she is a great role model! She just happens to be really hot too, you can't blame her for that!"
5,THE BEST CD EVER,I was very shocked on how good this cd was.Britney surely has done her thinking on how to do a good cd.'Slave 4 u' has a catchy beat that will stay in your head that makes you wanna get up and dance.'Overprotected' has a powerful message that really relates to teen life.'Lonely' is like her old song 'stronger' that u would want to listen to after u have a break up.'Anticipating'is a little to poppy but has a good sound to it and u would listen to this if u were in a happy mood.'I love rock and roll' is very catchy and has a edgy sound to it..'Bombastic love' and 'cinderella' have cool beats and are also very catchy.'What its like to be me' which has backup from her boyfriend justin timberlake has a rock and roll sound and you would listen to it if no one saw you for who you were.
1,Lip-synching Mouseketeer.......,I can't believe that this girl pretends to have talent.She sings nasally and babytalks instead of putting any soul and spirit in the songs...All this is marketing and not a cd from a promising artist..Her only asset is her body and her pouty lips and the way she looks into the camera in her videos...This is NOT talent!! Will she continue to show more of her body when she gets in her 50's and 60's???? I doubt it..That's all she has going for her...shallow bubblegum pop...Little girls should know better to buy this crap!!
2,it's okay if you like the beat but not her singing,"She's not the best singer in the world. Actually she really can't sing. In her latest cd her singing has gone downhill. Most of the time you can hear her trying to sing as if she could but can't. The beats are good, but most of the beats are the same for the most part. Since this is her first cd where she wrote the songs, don't be suprised if they aren't as good as her previous singles. I say it's just one of those 3rd releases that aren't worthy to be released."
2,BAD JOB BRITNEY,"Most of the songs sound the same, and there are too many of the same, and britney has a new vibe, thats horrible. Britney, you gotta go back to the vibe you had on Oops I Did It Again. Dont buy this cd, its not worth it. Britney sounds horrible, and all the songs sound exactly the same. The only good song is ""what its like to be me"", otherwise the cd is horrible"
3,Britney Album number 3,"well fisrt of all, i am NOT A BRITNEY FAN but wish to say that i do think the beats to her music is catchy. her voice is shocking and i am sure i am not the only person to think this. if so many people continually say this than really, britney does not have a voice nor does she have talent. her sound has improved. not a terrible cd but not a pleasant one either. lyrics are still very immature and teeny!!!"
3,It was okay,"Like a lot of fans I like Britney Spears. However, I don't think this CD proved how talented of a singer she is, nor did it represent her ""maturity"" as an artist. Her songs are catchy and that's what the public today wants. I think she has the ability to perform and entertain, but her voice has not developed into a great singer. Her voice has a tendency to sound very nasal, which you end up hearing the same type of songs because her voice can only do so much. I am not trying to totally bash on Britney, because out of very few of my friends I like her, but as far as her new CD goes, she has not matured as a singer or as a songwriter."
3,"This must be ""Pop""?","First off let me start off by saying I am Black and Britney's music is typically not my style. But I must admit that ""Britney"" is pushing Ms. Spears into a better music direction. You can clearly see Britney is fast approaching 21 when club bangers such as SLAVE with lyrics ""All you people look at me like I'm a little girl"" and and she's also tired of being so ""Damn"" OVERPROTECTED.""Britney"" is clearly a little R&b with songs such songs of my favorites on the disc Janet Jackson-ish BOYS but she still keeps Pop fans happy with songs such as up beat tempoed THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME.The only ballad on the disc NOT A GIRL.... clearly shows Britney does have some talent. ALthough not the best c.d. out today, ""Britney"" is a good record."
3,...,"...i purchased the cd long ago when it came out and im still listening to it. I am a fan of many different music genres...although its all music to me...and i can appreciate dumb fun. Thats exactly what this kind of music is for, dumb unadulterated fun. THe songs are very catchy and very dancable and i cant help but shake my groove thing while i listen to it. My favorite songs out of the albume are ""im a slave..."", ""boys"" and ""anticipating""...kinda reminds me of Janet back in the day. While Britney may not have the best voice out there, she has an ok voice to carry the songs she does have...and thats ok with me. I gave the cd 3 stars because it isnt great music, or even an attempt at great music...its just pure fun and ...you can join the rest of us across the globe dancing to britney and we can all sing along and say ""Hit us britney...one more time."""
3,Britney is cute but there's no progress in this album,"It seems that the sound in this album is not grow up , i thoughtshe's still pride of the success that she got from the former albumTo all the music consumer who expect to hear the cool musicshould neglect this album because there's no progress inthis album , Britney is not different from oops i did it again"
4,slave 4 britney,"britney spears third and best album yet!!!im a slave 4 u-9.8/10overprotected-10/10lonely-10/10im not a girl-9/10boys-4/10anticipating-8/10i love rock n roll-9/10cinderella-9.2/10let me be-10/10bombastic love-9/10where u take me-7/10what its like to be me feat. justin-7/10great work britney, britneys new album will be realesed on october 2003 new songs are HOLLOW ,SHOWDOWN ,AND SACRED co- written by britney spears!!!!"
3,Not her best,"Not Brits best cd.That would be Oops.Many of the songs sound like Janet Jackson rip offs.I think she ruined ""I Love Rock n Roll"".If Joan Jett were dead she would be rolling over in her grave.Exept for Im a Slave 4 U all the songs sound like the same ones from Oops...i did it again.Its a shame to.This could have been an exellent cd.Sounds like the same old teen pop that everyone else is doing.If Britney wants to last longer she needs to find some new producers and songwriters."
5,Rock On,This album has all the beats and it just keeps on going. From a serious song that pulls at the heart to a fast and upbeat song that gets you dancing. It has no mistakes in it. It's fun and it is just what we all expected and have come to love about Britney. What a great album... well worth the money. I promise.
1,yes,"uh huh, yes. that's right, yes. i give it a 1, and here's why. i spend too much time masturbating to this music to actually listen to the music. yes."
2,She's Trying to be BAD--It Doesn't Work on Her,"After hearing her past two albums, I expected much better out of this one. It isn't Britney--at all. Like I said, she is tying to fit into the mold as ""bad"", and it doesn't work on her. The photos are unflattering, and if you want a ""bad"", but respectible album, check out ""Stripped"", by Christina Aguilera.I'm a Slave 4 U-1/5Overprotected-5/5Lonely-2/5I'm not a Girl, not Yet a Woman-4/5Boys-1/5Anticipating-3/5I Love Rock 'N' Roll-4/5Cinderella-5/5Let me Be-2/5Bombastic Love-1/5That's Where You Take me-1/5What it's Like to be me-1/5AVERAGE RATING-2/5"
2,A let down...........,"This cd was somewhat of a dissapointment for me. I have always loved Britney's cds until now. The song I'm A Slave for you is a really fun song to listen to with but with all the strange panting and the little parts were she goes ""I just want to have sex with you."" is a little out of hand. So it's hard to really know if the song is good or bad. The other songs on here are very well put together but the not very great songs out number the good. So I guess it all depends on your taste of music because some won't like it and others won't. But for me I could of done with out."
4,Britney keeps getting better. I thinks she'll keep improving,"My favorite songs on this cd is ""Cinderella"". If you listen to words it's about a women who decides to get out a bad relationship that she is been into to long. I really relate to this song because I was there and it's reminds me it was the best decision I made to not go back to him.I also like ""What it's like to be me"" it was penned by Justin Timberlake and some guy and I just think it's really catchy.There really isn't a song I don't like on here. Some of them I prefer more than others but I really like the cd. I hope that she will continue to grow and her next cd should be even better!"
2,Britney Has Ever Made Better,"I was very decepted by this album. Though the cover is beautiful, the songs all look the same and the whole album screams disaster. The only song that has a unique sound is ""I'm a slave for you"" but everyone knows Britney ever did better than that. But I appreciate a lot the song ""I'm not a girl, not yet a woman"", the lyrics are great and the melody is relaxing, but if you compare to Oops I did it again CD, you might really appreciate better ""Where are you now"" as a slow song. The song ""I love Rock'N'Roll"" is awesome too, but it's nothing but a look-a-like of Oop's I did it again's ""Satisfaction"". Frankly if you like pop music, you might prefer way more the two first albums."
1,"Please, no, not another album","I have seen it before, the running of 13-year-old girls to a britny spears concert. I felt sorry for them and scoffed then burst out laughing. That reminds me of this CD mostly. Think I have never listened to it? No, the radio plays this crap a lot and therefore, I switch the station to something better like... nails on a chalkboard. She can't sing, and she's the worst role model for anybody. She even called herself a [huffy] (I'm not going to say what she actually said for the fear of being edited.)If you like britny spears, and if you are 13, it is time to find yourself a band with real music."
1,burn this album and send it back to hell from where it came,"I find it both shocking and disturbing that anyone could possibly call this music.This isn't music,it's prostituion.This so called ""artist""(puke)has other people write a bunch of throaway meaningless dribble that we call pop,she runs her singing voice throw a protool progam so her voice sounds half decent,and thn gets rich off a bunch of shallow minded teeny boppers.This makes me physickaly ill.I have no idea how garbage like this mekes it platinum status while true hardworking artists like aphex twin and the dismeberment plan get the bumb rush.Sickening."
1,"This is bad, it's really bad!","This album is full out cheesy cornyness! All of the songs start to sound the same after a while, the only two songs that I think are even slightly promising are Cinderella and What It's Like to be Me, but after a while I'd get sick of them too! This album sounds so different from her other two albums but it hasn't changed for the better! Take a listen to the samples and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about! This is deffinitely one of those albums where you must listen before you buy it! See for yourself! Happy hunting!"
5,The Best Britney CD,"1 I'm a Slave 4U - good beat....it's my favorite song :)different style.....2 Overprotected - this one is like other britney songs...it is my second favorite ...3 Lonely - One of the tracks Spears co-wrote...really cool song4 Not a girl not yet a woman - theme song to her upcoming film ""Crossroads""5 Boys - Different kind of song like slave...but 1 of my favorites.6 Anticipating - also written by britney....it is a good song7 I love rock n roll - Britney's voice its perfect for this track8 Cinderella - also written by britney....cool song9 Let me be - Coool song10 Bombastic Love - Good beat....great!11 That where u take me - her voice is so cute in it!12 What is like to be me - GREAT song....written by Britney's choreographer Wade Robson and NSync front member Justin Timberlake"
3,this is hard...,"Alright. I listen to Britney Spears, and have this cd. It's not what you'd call brilliant, but it isn't [bad]. She has talent, but most people can't really see it-they just see the photos and the clothes, then immeadiatly diss her. I wouldn't listen to this cd day and night, but I think it's totally fine...though she sounds sorta creepy in the first song. SO...I'm not saying she rocks-or [is bad]. I'm saying she deserves the credit for this cd."
3,Erm..... Good or Bad?,"I cant decide whether i like this album or not. Britney has matured, yes, but is she a mature artist? No. She's no 'the next Madonna', but she doesnt suck majorly. Some of her songs are kinda pointless, like Anticipating. I cant stand that song. But, i like What it's like to be me. I have to say that it's not the best album, and you certainly are NOT missing out if you dont have it."
2,My ReViEw!!!!,"ok...so im a teen....im supposed to love Brit? Her new CD is ok, but I think she did better when she didn't have to make out with a mirror *video:Im a slave 4 u* to be seen as ""talented"". I really dont like her remake of ""I love Rock and Roll"" it sounds pretty bad compared to the real thing. I think she has a talent, maybe not the greatest lyrics...but she needs to figure out a way to make better use of it."
5,A Musical Revelation,"This album entitled ""Britney"" is simply some of the best work come up by her to date. Her past two albums were great career starters, but this new album has something that makes it stand apart from the other two, it has an edgier more futuristic flare.My favorite song is ""Overprotective"", it just seems like something new that no one has come up with before. Britney, your the best, and you will always be to your true die-hard fans. We love you."
2,OMG what was she thinking!?!,"Ok now this album wasnt the worst ive heard so i gave it 2 stars cause it was close. Dont get me wrong, i love Britney Spears but this album just didnt do it for her.""Im a slave 4 you"" was an ok song but she keeps the same tune basicly and it gets boring. I do like the songs ""Bombastic Love"" and ""Cinderella"" is ok. The one song i think i so unbelievably bad is ""Im not a girl, not yet a woman"" OMG she sounds sooooo bad in. Her voice was not ment for that song. I really can not stand that song. This is my own opinion so just check out the album BEFORE you buy it."
4,Her best yet,"This album is extremely high concept, we get to find out about Britney Spears... (the person), but that doesnt always mean that the album itself is that good. While it does show a maturation of britney as an artist, most of the time, the songs are actually kind of boring. This albume one stand out, I'm a slave 4 U, only because The Neptunes did a good job in making an INTERESTINGLY sounding song, and while britney may lack the vocal merit, the dressed up beats that the neptunes bring to this song make it more then listenable. The other producers also deliver catchy songs. Plus britney chipped in a bit in the writing department, with credits for co-writing a little over half the album, thats got to be worth something, right?"
2,Fair,This album is fair but Britney is getting way over her head!...Some songs are good like Overprotected but some I think kids wouldn't understand like I am a Slave 4 U because they just wouldn't understand with all the huffing and puffing plus they don't think it has a dance beat to it.
2,Apalling and Appealing,"First, let me say that I am not a fan of Britney Spears. I bought this album merely to hear what all the fuss was over this easily packageable star. While I thought most of the songs were completely overproduced and vulgar, and the way that she ""sings""(most of the time, her voice reduces to what im guessing is supposed to be a seductive whisper), I give her 2 stars for taking a risk at switching writing teams,and her style of music."
2,eh....,"I'll be honest with you, sometimes when im in the mood ill dance to Britney in my room, but thats it. What it comes down to is that her music is fun and puts you in a good mood, but she has zero talent. If i had been taking dance since i was born and had a full staff to work on my body, hair and makeup I could be jsut as good. Her voice is awful, and though her music is fun, she didn't write and she doesnt sing it well, she jsut looks pretty faking it. dont waste your money on this cd, just listen to I'm A slave FOR (not 4...i Hate when people do that) You, its only on every five minutes!"
5,Buy it!,"This CD has really shown that Britney Spears has matured. Her other two albums were good, but this one was definetly the best. She has matured a lot more with her voice, style, and way of thought. I bought this CD the first day it came out and I was really surprised and satisfied. I listen to this CD almost every day and I love it. I gave it five stars because it a a truly fun and enjoyable expeirience to listen to her and her amazing voice. Buy it!"
3,I think they pushed her too fast,This album is ok but I think they tried to put it together too fast you can tell
4,It be Britney!,"This new album is definatly a new look at our Britney. She definatly changed her style, for better or for worse. She went in the same direction as NSYNC*, which was a more techno sound to their music. As a lot of people saw, many of the old NSYNC* fans didn't like the change in music and left their favorite boy band behind. Lets hope this doesn't happen to our girl Britney!"
2,"Britney Britney, stop tryin too hard","If ur plannin on buyin dis cd, don't. Cuz this cd [is bad]. Only sum songs are ok. Here is a list of songs dat I rated.1.im a slave 4 u - 5/10. not a very good song2.overprotected - 8/10. ok pop song3. lonely - 1/10. horrible. she tries to mix dis song with pop and rock.4. im not a girl, not yet a woman - 3/10. bad slow song5. boys - HORRIBLE!!! its like another version of im a slave 4u, but im a slave 4 u is much better6. anticipating - 9/10. best song on dis album. great party song7. i love rock n roll - 8/10. good rock song. but stop tryin to do rock, britney8. cinderella -2/10 terrible pop song9.let me be - 2/10. bad.....10. bombastic love - 3/10...rythm's good but bad overall11. that's where u take me - 8/10...ok slow song12. what's it like to be me - 4/10..same, shes tryin to mix it with pop and rock"
5,Britney's the Best,"I honestly dont think that a lot of peopel who revewied this CD negatively, even bothered to listen to it, because much of teh information was incorrect. First of all, teh album is great and much different than her otehr two, with funky beats and a different sound. Proof of this is producers such as teh Neptunes, and Dido. Its great club music, and i just want to clear up one thing about the album. Not all of britney's fans are 9 and 10 years old. I happen to be univeristy-attendee, and am a huge fan of Britney's as are a lot of other older people that I know. No- we don't have her posters on our walls, but we nevertheless love her music. Her songs such as ""Boys"", is targeted towards a older crowd and teh entire CD can by no means be labled as ""bubblegum"". IN short, Brit's new CD is somethign different for EVERYONE, contrary to popular belief."
5,"""Britney"" rocks","Britney's latest album is so great! It totally shows how she has grown as a musician and person. The music is so great to listen to, and there's such a variety on the album!"
4,A journey into the soul,"In these times of strife, I seek Britney for consolation and wisdom - her music resonates like the mountain scent of a warm candle, within the confines of dusky garage apartment. Her voice soothes, like the tone of heartfelt poem, read by your very own mother, or another such close relation.""Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"" is the poetry Stipe, Vedder and Bono pretend to be, while some of Britney's other raunchier songs....Ah, forget it. Buy the album and see for yourself."
3,Not Enough Change,"I'm a big Britney fan, but now I realize that this album does not show enough transition. She promised that it will be edgier, but most of it is still the same stuff from the previous albums. Hopefully she learn that lesson on the fourth album. ..."
1,Ew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst Britney album in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Correction : The worst album in the world!!!!!!!!!!! All the songs arwe so annoying and boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The worst ones are ( the ones you should NEVER listen to) Im a slave 4 u, Lonley, Im not a girl not yet a woman, Boys, Let me be (Let her be what?) Anticipating, Cinderella , Bombastic love, Thats where you take me, and Whats its like to be me. true britney fans, if want to hear the real her, buy , * Baby one more * * In the Zone * and * Opps ............ I did it again* Not this crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Baby one more time* : Must have!* In the Zone * : Must have!* Opps................ I did it again* : Must have."
1,So....this is her grown up??? sad....very very sad,"If you like sugary pop, this is the CD for you. If you want to hear the growth Britney think she went through, look eles where. Nothing about her has really changed. She's still the ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" girl. I was hoping for some growth but I guess that's all she got to offer. Just download the CD if you want it. It's a waste of money otherwise. I kinda like ""I'm Not Yet A Girl...."" and ""Overprotected."" So, there's the star she deserves."
1,WHAT WAS SHE THINKING???,"Okay, yes i was once a Britney fan. But give me a break, this is a bad CD. She can't sing at all. I could not help read all the reviws and all i could think was ""Were they listening to the same cd as i was"". In my opinion there are no good songs on the cd. Save your money it's not worth buying."
2,"Again, another awful album by the so called pop princess","Okay first of all she never should have been allowed to do a cover of Joan Jetts I Love Rock N Roll. She totally ruined a great song. She sounds awful. She cant sing, I dont understand why people cant hear that. Her voice is awful. There are a couple of catchy songs on this album but it's not worth it, save your money."
1,this CD isn't even worth 1 star...,"please don't waste your money on this junk. this is not music, nor is is singing. it's britney moaning like a frog with an overwhelming amount of machine support.go get yourself some real music like Rancid, Mest, or even Good Charlotte. Anything is better than this!"
2,What Happened?,"What happened with Britney? She was so pretty, so talented, and now she takes on the image of a garbage bag in a dumpster in a New York ally. Sure, ""I Love Rock N' Roll"" is a good re-make, possibly, in my opinion, better then the original. And sure, ""Cinderella"" has the same pop sound as songs on Britney's previous album, Oops...I Did It Again. But what's with all the disgusting photos and cussing lyrics? Does Britney not realize how badly people that aren't in her trash-trance make fun of her? It seems like she just keeps getting worse and worse with every album.(...)"
2,Very dissapointing.,"Her first two albums were amazing and i could see how talented she was just by the lyrics, she introduced a whole new genre of music to the pop culture. Her first couple of hits such as ""hit me baby one more time"" or ""oops i did it again"" revealed her obvious talent and ambition and at that time she was what i like to consider, ""underground"", but i knew after her newfound popularity and how much all the public loved her, that her music would start to decline and it would become more commercial, just like all the other great pop artists........backstreet boys, christana agulara, 'nsync, and even the all-time pop artist....michael jackson. So all in all this album just isn't the top notch britney quality that i once knew, and thats all i gotta say..........just kidding!"
1,people are finally catching on,"I knew from the beginning she was trailer trash and this album confirmed it even more she can't sing worth a penny at all, she can only afford good songwriters, and even they can't enhance her abilities. Neptunes should have just saved their beats for someone talented. But stupid girls my age were buying this [...], disgusting!"
1,FINE EXAMPLE OF COMMERCIAL GARBAGE.,"If you look in the dictionary for the word sellout,you will find a picture of britney and p diddy.I cant even begin to describe how awful this cd is.All the music on this cd sounds the same as all of her previous records and is very boring.She is now resorting to selling her sexuality to appeal to a wider audience.Who does she think she is fooling?All the mtv sheep out there probably have this album since they dont have minds of their own.She butchers the classic song ""I love rock n roll"" just to provide filler songs on her album.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM HER!!!"
3,Not All Bad,"Everyone is slaming Britney about her lastest C.D. A lot of her songs go along with the same kind of beat, which is the only down side I can see. The only song without a lot of bass is "" I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"", which is a beautiful song I may add. Her C.D. is just showing that she's done with growing up; she's not 16 anymore. She should have put another song with a soft tone to make it more well rounded. ""I'm A Slave For You,"" is a song that stands out. A lot of artists' music is really similar, but this song has its own style. If you think Britney Spears has gross lyrics, then you obviously haven't listened to Destiny's Child or Pink. ""Bombastic Love"" has a great beginning ping, and ""Overprotected"" has lyrics that hook you. The C.D. isn't as good as her earlier ones, but it is still a good buy. The only problem with it is that the bass is a little overcoming."
5,The Hottest Album Yet!,"Britney has definately shown her maturity in her third album ""Britney"". With tracks such as Boys, I'm A Slave 4 U, and Lonely, it is evident that she is headed for an older crowd and yet is keeping the teens content with songs such as Overprotected, Cinderella, and the beautiful ballad I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. This is by far the greatest achievement Britney has accomplished and I wish her all the best of luck (...). Congratulations to her and I hope each and every Amazon visitor picks up a copy of this awesome album! Check out Amzon.co.uk to find the European version of ""Britney"" including 2 BONUS TRACKS!"
3,BRITNEYS WORST BUT STILL OK,"VERY GOOD CD BUT ONLY 3 STARS AS ITS HER WORST OUT OF THEM ALBUMS SHE IS WORKING ON THE MONA LISA ALBUM AT THE MO AND NAINME SPEARS FROM KINGDOM HEARTS FINAL MIX FAN VERSION HIS ABOUT TO RELEASE THIS BUT CALLED ""NAINME"""
2,Don't waste your $,"I only listened to the samples...but just from listening to them I can hardly stand to listen to 30 seconds of some of these songs. There are only about 3-4 good songs. Those would be ""Slave"", ""Overprotected"" ""NAGNYAW"", & ""Cinderella"" The rest are awful! I was turned off just by ""I Love Rock & Roll"" It cannot even be compared to the original! It's so bad. She sounds like her nose is plugged! But then again she does in about half of her songs. She seriously needs to learn how to SING and get rid of that funky ""techno"" stuff that makes her voice sound even more (...). Just my opinion. I usually like any music, but this is just awful. I liked ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Oops"" but each time she gets worse. This is definitely not her best work."
1,"Ummm, is Britney going to grow up?","The first album was an achiever: ...Baby, One More Time was excellent and cemented the vestal virgin' Sexy and Seventeen routine for all the guys in the audience. I did like I'm a Slave 4 U since it had a Paisly Park (Prince) appeal but the rest of the album was so fassssssst, it just didn't gell. Well, guys, sex appeal only goes so far when production is razor thin. Kids will actually find this ""music"" great, but the grown-up audience that loved the first album and liked some of the 2nd will be disappointed in the Pop Princess. (...)"
2,... what happened?,"Fans looking for the innocent pop stylings of Britney Spears will be severely jolted by her self-titled album. The romantic, upbeat, peppy and fun songs that we loved on ""baby... one more time"" and ""oops! I did it again..."" are missing. In their place are violent, choppy modern -- what? it's not rock, it's not pop, it's not rap. It's kind of a techno combination of all three. Britney rasps her voice (she'd better quit or risk permanently damaging her vocal chords) and plays around halfheartedly with forgettable lyrics. What happened?In addition, her works are getting progressively more raunchy. Mild profanity. Innuendo. Rebellion. And then there's the accompanyment. The CD itself is engraved with three obviously naked fairies. The back of the disk (and most of the insert) sports Britney in a barely-there ensemble at that at first glance makes you think she's topless.This is one fan who's decided to pull the plug. And unfortunately, this album makes it much easier than I thought."
4,great listen kiddies,"Britney Spears's new album is one that promises to show great creativity. Writing about five of the songs herself they all show how creative she is, however, they also all practically talk about her. Other than that, it is a great cd. The cover of ""I Love Rock N Roll"" is great and humourous all at the same time. She does a great job. As I sit here listening to her CD i dare to wonder, is there more Britney around the corner? And as I further sit here I can answer my own question. Britney is not going anywhere."
1,this is my opinion...don't waste your money,"ok i've heard the album a day before it was released. and i'm sorry but that cd was boring. i'll admit that 'i'm a slave 4 u' was a good song. it's the ONLY good song on the WHOLE cd. i got tired listening to the songs. they all sound very much alike and all sound dumb. she still has that 'little girl' sound that i never liked. but to all you britney fans, you'll probably like it. sounds just like her other cd's. but if you really want some quality music i wouldn't buy this cd. well that's just my opinion."
1,Boring like all the rest of her work,"Very painful to listen to. Britney is a plastic corporate dupe. Her sound has matured?... well maybe for a 7 year old to an 8 year old. Britney Spears is the Johnny Bravo of our time. Britney Spears is to music like food is to McDonalds, many people eat it, and it is incredibly popularwith the masses (especially the kiddies), but does that mean that it is good?I see no growth in Britney, which is sad. Most of the CD had that cut ""boy band"" sound. Britney would do well to study some great female songwriters such as: Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin, Joni Mitchell, and Jonatha Brooke to name a few. Britney right now has about 1/1500th of their talent and songwriting skill."
2,Britney! Stop hanging on to Max Martin!,"Her voice is too strain and there is no way she can reinvent herself! How can she be her own person when dirty old males are still writing her songs! I never hear her songs on the radio...only on MTV! Britney needs to realize she won't have a long term music career like Christina Aguilera. Christina is way ahead of Britney when it comes to keeping music fresh...just look at Christina's latest video, ""Figher""! Christina is actually learning from Madonna's career how to stay strong in the music industry. Even though Britney already has three albums (all rushed and done without giving any thought to creativity), avoid getting Ms. Spears 3rd installment..."
3,Pretty Good......for a pop record,"Britney claims on this junior record that she is ""Not girl"" but still ""Not yet a woman,"" and like Britney, the listener will also be stuck between loving this cd and hating it. Some songs on here profess her mature attitude, while others still allow you to cringe at the corny words and simple beats. ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", ""Boys"", ""Overprotected,"" and ""What's like to be me"" show her ability to grow as an artist (compared to previous album songs); however, ""Bombastic Love,"" ""Anticipation,"" and ""Cinderella"" all prove that Britney is NOT A WOMAN. These filler songs bring the quality of the album far down. Overall this record is a pretty good POP album, but when compared to other artist, Britney stands no ground. Her voice is MUCH better than previous album's, but she is a performer--not a singer, and without a video to back up these songs, they might not stand a chance on the radio. Overall: Buy it . . . if you like Britney."
2,Britney Spears-...,"Well what can I say. Many people either hate Britney Spears orlike her. In my opinion I liked her years ago but now I don't really care for her music. The music is catchy but the songs are the same. Its like listening to her whole album in one song. It is pretty annoying. But that is my opinion if your daughter or you enjoy Britney then hey buy the CD. I mean why me stop you. All I can say is please don't buy this CD if your child is under 10 years old b/c of the sexual content in the CD. I mean If you want your child to be hearing ima slave 4 you,dance up on me,hell, and swearing words then buy it lol. I just hope for better music in the future from Britney maybe a different beat.I know she can do better then this."
2,"A creative cover, but thats where it ends...","Being her sophmore album, I thought I would give Britney a chance. After all, the constant bambardment over the past three years of endless pop music has softened me up. So, I put aside my angry girl music and popped in what was to be the ""grown up Britney."" I was suprised to hear the girl who doesn't think of herself as a ""sex kitten"" all tarted up and ready for action. Although Britney seems to tests the boundries with her fans and critics, this album seems too grown up for the under thirteen market and too kiddie for the adult in me. Nice try Brit, maybe next time you could release two albums; one that's PG and one that doesn't need to blurp out the ""S"" word."
5,Britney,"Hit songs , great album cover and almost 21 years old before her 3rd album released in Nov 2001 !Your gonna get the goods. From I'm a slave 4 u to What's it like to be me. Britney rules!"
1,Worst Britney album!!!...,"Ew!!!...1.Im a slave 4 u 6\10 EW!!!... I always skip it!!! BAD start!!!2.Overprotected 8\10 Gets boring3.Lonely 4\10 Very bad!!!...4.Im not a girl not yet a women 7.5\10 Whats the point!!????5. boys 1\10 Very,very,very,very,very,very.very,very,very,very,very,very,very, very bad song!!!...!6 Anticipating0\10 worst than Boys7.

Thats where you take me 0\10 Words cant describe this song!!!...12. What its like to me 0\10 One of the WORST songs Ive ever heard!!!...Plaese dont buy this album!!!... Your ears will thank you. Here's my overall album rating 1.5\10."
3,She is maturing before your eyes,"Like a puppet being changed offstage, here is the new and improved version of a so called woman. Britney is banking off her good looks and same mindless formula used by many popular figures in media...change and create a new so-called improved image or version of yourself, sure this is a better performance than her latter, but come on, her corporate masters like ruining little girls, just like they did before with Madonna cept britney is starting a little younger, and now she is trying to start her acting career hahaha dont make me laugh, unless she is in a skin flick dont bother going. its madonna's clone, im just waiting for her to change her name to some sort of symbol alla prince."
1,The Best from Britney,"Well, I have to say that yes this is her best cd to date. But that isn't saying much. Britney Spears is a packaged girl who is now complaining about how she is so ""overprotected"". I'm sorry but the girl goes around in little to nothing infront of her fan base (13 and under girls and 35 and older guys). But still this is her best work to date, as to quote a friend after she had listened to the album: ""I like the voice they created for her."" (to bad the voice is only 1 octive). The best stand out songs are ""I'm a slave 4 U"" and ""Overprotected"". Anyone who is an *NSYNC fan will surely pick up on the ""me"" song in the song (listen to ""It's gonna be me"" and listen how Justin sings the ""me"" and you'll understand). I doubt it will win her a grammy or too much respect, but the cd will satisfy her fans, atleast untill they all grow up alittle."
2,My Review,"Classics (expect to hear these on the radio for years to come): I'm A Slave 4 U.Flavor Of The Week Hits (don't expect to hear it again once the single after it is released): Boys, Overprotected, I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.Should-have-been-hits: None.Never-should-have-been-created crap: I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman, What It's Like To Be Me, That's Where You Take Me."
2,Very Dissapointing,"I thought that Britney's first two CDs were great, but this just didn't make the cut for me. This album clearly shows that Britney wants to prove to the world that she's not a teenybopper by wearing even more outrageous outfits, and trying to sound mature and sexy. She also tries to cuss a little in ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", and she tries to sound sexy and nasty in ""Boys"", but I'm sorry to say it's not working. Many songs, such as ""What It's Like To Be Me"" and ""Overprotected"" still had that teenybopper ring that was apparent in her first CD. I think that Britney should really stop trying to be someone she's not, (like Christina Aguilera) but actually sing the right type of music that works for her that was in her first two CDs. I hope that Britney will put out a better CD next time that will have people actually glad to listen to."
5,Britney ROCKS...what else is new!? ;-),"Well...I've been a Britney fan since her first cd came out....I thought she was great then and I still do. Personally, I think this cd is awesome!! My friend and I are both HUGE Britney fans, and we went to her concert twice...the last time we had front row and sound check...and Britney was great. I think this cd is really good, you can tell shes grown up alot since her first cds. The songs are catchy and fun...very dance-able too!! I recommend this cd very highly!!"
5,Best Album Britney's Done!,"The c.d has a nice beat as it kicks off with "" I'm a Slave 4 u"" the c.d has so many beats it makes you want to dance. "" I love Rock and Roll"" is a greta beat as Britney sings about loving a guy."" What it's like being me"" her dou song with Justin Timberlake is a smooth song which is nicely beat which makes you feel good. This c.d. is a plan must have!"
3,"Ooops, she did not do it again!","I was waiting for this album, but after listening it 3 times, this CD will probably move in the ""just ok column"". The ""hooks"" are not very good, so one hour after listening, I can only remember the phrase ""I'm A Slave"". But that is not enough. The song ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" became just a lame pop cover song. I hope, she has the support for an Album No.4. Because No. 3 is not a good number for her..."
1,Oops she did it again,"Now I know why I am not a Britney fan. The only song on this album with any kind of originality is ""I'm a slave 4 U"" and I even dislike this song. The rest of the album sounds like one big song that goes on for an hour. The entire sound of this album coupled with the juvenile lyrics makes for bad music. Sorry Britney"
4,Britney's self-titled release rocks,"Many know that teen queen Britney Spears is my all-time favorite living singer. Her third release (which I bought opening day which I've done for most of her albums) simply titled BRITNEY is no doubt a work of art for the new-age pop era. Its hot beats earn it critic acclaim. Her vocals aren't the best...but so what? They're unique and atypical from anybody else out there. Plus it's not like she's really about her voice, is it? No wonder Britney keeps garnishing Grammy nods. ""Overprotected"" definitely should've won Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance! Overall, BRITNEY rocks."
4,Reigning pop princess shows growth & maturity on new release,"The current queen of teen pop music delivers a new CD full of up-tempo, grown-up tunes. Tracks like ""Boys"" and ""Anticipating"" feature elements reminiscent of 1970's disco if that's your thing; or if you prefer ""edgier"" Britney, like on ""Stronger"" from her last release, then ""Lonely"" and ""Cinderella"" may be just for you. The leadoff track and single, ""I'm A Slave 4 You"" evokes memories of ""Control""-era Janet Jackson, and the latest release (at the time of this review), ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,"" may be the 19-year old diva's finest vocal performance yet. The cover of the Arrows' ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll,"" best known as recorded by Joan Jett, is far superior to Miss Spears's earlier covers of Sonny & Cher and Rolling Stones classics. This sort of music isn't my thing; but I actually enjoyed this CD. (...)"
1,Britney Breaks New Ground!,"Britney's work with the Swedish Acoustic Symphony Orchestra on this masterpiece should be studied in every music theory class in the country.Not only does she explore strong Elizabethan progressive rock (while playing a flute on one foot), but she's also given us groundbreaking television commercials with the will-be anthem ""We Will Rock You"", which I hear has already been covered by lesser British pop combos.Keep an eye out for her next concept-opus about social injustice, bourgeois satire, and political upheaval....or dating."
1,People enjoy this?,"Britney Spears' debut album, 'Baby One More Time' wasn't bad, I actually liked a few of the songs, and I'm no pop fan. Everyone else loved it, and she was one of the biggest celebrities of that time. Since then, it has been downhill all the way for Britney, and in this album, it appears she can't sing. She already has a really, really, really, really good reputation, and with her first album she has got so many loyal fans, and I'm not sure if anyone really likes this album, but her fans pretend to like it because it's Britney Spears. I would not reccomend this album. Buy her first, if you have the money, buy the second, but definitely skip this."
2,Not For Younger Audiences,"My 10 year old loves Britney. I bought her the new CD and was very disappointed with the lyrics. They are too suggestive. I would like to warn other parents that this CD crosses the line. If you are buying this for a child, you might want to think twice."
2,Stupid but fun,"Okay don't expect the meaning of life in Miss spears new album but it is light hearted and she is the queen of bubble gun. Actually don't expect the meaning of anything in this overproduced eye candy. Britney is a sweet girl, and her wanna be nastie is not working out. She should start going back saying ""yal"" and ""yes mama""--we love her for it.For example her track ""boys"" starts off with her singing in her typical robotic recorder voice ""so curious"" over and over it is really annoying."
5,"Dude, this rocks","Britney did it again, this cd is great....Even the remake of Joan Jett's I love Rock and Roll is tremendously done. Her voice has never sounded better. if you want some great music, don't hesitate at all to buy this gem!"
1,It doesn't work.,I received the item yesterday and it doesn't even work. Not worth paying and waiting for something that isn't going to work when you get it.
3,Not many good songs.....ehhhh,"Well...NOT a big fan of Brit..but i DO have to admit there are 3 good songs that i like, 1.I'm A Slave 4 U 2.Overprotected 3.Boys...and thats it...the rest are weak...shes trying too hard and she cant really sing..shes all over the place with her ""style"" in music. I didn't like the CD. Only Those 3 songs. But everyone has their OWN taste"
4,Really Grows On You,"This CD really grew on me. At first, I only liked the songs ""I'm A Slave For You"" and ""Boys"", but as time went on, I really enjoyed more and more of the CD. The best songs are ""I'm A Slave For You"", ""Boys"", ""Let Me Be"", and ""Anticipating."" While the album version of ""Overprotected"" is good, the Darkchild remix (available on Now That's What I Call Music! 10) blows it out of the water. Some other standouts, yet not as good as the previously mentioned songs are ""I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman"", ""Bombastic Love"", and ""Lonely"". The rest of the CD is pretty good also. As far as Britney CD's go, this CD is up there is quality. It is a nice step for the pop-princess, yet she perfects her move in this year's ""In The Zone"" (highly recommended). This CD is well worth the money. The songs are, actually, pretty fun to dance to. The CD barely ever slows down (only on I'm Not A Girl..) and keeps up the fun. I definitely recommend checking this CD out, it's really good. Enjoy!"
1,Pure unadulterrated trash,"I can confidently state that this is one of the worst albums ever put to tape.I mean who in their sanity would want to buy albums from a fake who does not write her own songs, brazenlylip synchs in front of millions and dresses up like a slut.Songs like I am a slave 4 you make me feel like throwing up in disgust.NO DONT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS CRAP.Get something nice like OBSCURED BY CLOUDS from PINK FLOYD instead."
3,Good,"This album is good. The songs are fine. But Britney's lyrics do not make me happy. This album needs a explicit lyrics sign. I want the new album to be better. If you are fan you can buy it.If you are not a fan, I don't recommend it for you."
4,Britney Shifts into Third Gear for something a bit new,"in a few words, it's a good cd. I like the fact that there's only one really slow song on the album, but the length of the cd is just upsetting. 40 minutes? oh well.Songs That stand out to me :Overprotected, Boys, Cinderella, Bombastic Love, What It's Like To Be MeJustin's vocals help a lot in the last track as do all the computer effects throughout the cd. Good job. Nice to see Britney helped write a few of the songs too."
3,Hmmmm....,"Omigosh, what happened??!! is what I wanted to say when I saw the cover of Britney Spears' new album and heard ""(I'm a) Slave 4 U."" She used to be sweet and innocent looking and now....well...she went from PG-13 to almost R.I really did like the old Britney, maybe because I'm more of a ""soda-pop"" person than ""dirty-pop."" Is it true Justin of *NSync helped her with this album? He succeeded in making Britney more of a(...)than before!I know some people will like this new style, and maybe some will agree with me. The beat and melody for ""Slave 4 U"" is nice and catchy, but the lyrics....how cheesy!What will be next, Miss Britney ""X-rated"" Spears? How is this artist supposed to be appropriate for kids?As you can see, the cover of ""Britney"" gives a sneak preview of the inside. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan of Britney Spears (maybe? kinda? sorta?) and I wish her luck with her future, but I guess I'll have to look and listen to Mandy Moore for pop the way I like it now."
3,"Britney's ""In Between"" album","As every long-lasting artist does after a few years of fame ""Britney"" is Britney Spears 'in-between' album, where vocal quality drops and tracks begin to get edgier. The album starts on a perfect note, the Neptunes moaning/groaning ""Slave 4 U"" gets you in the mood with its wild beats and breathy vocals. Then ""Overprotected"" kicks in with a more of a pop feel than ""Slave"", but catchy and worthy none the less. Then Britney strikes with a rocky pop song where she takes control. The Neptunes second produced track ""Boys"" slides in with the wilder rnb beats after everyone wakes up from the dido penned track ""Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman"". The next 7 tracks become a dissapointing blur, untill you listen for a second time when 4 of those tracks come alive, the interesting cover ""I Love Rock & Roll"", ""Cinderella"", ""Bombastic Love"" and the fantastic rocky introducing ""Let Me Be"".On the whole ""Britney"" is a good album, but not great. There are standout tracks, but no huge hits."
3,"Mediocre Pop album, not bad at all","While ""Baby one more time"" and ""Oops! I did it again"" were only products which had no substance, this album is actually an improvement and it has a few great songs. The first single ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" is an amazing R&B/Hip-Hop Club hit, it's sexy and danceable, just like a few other songs. But there are still too many bubble gum tracks, like the horrible ""Anticipating"" (one of her worst songs ever)."
5,Pretty good realy not bad!,To tell you the truth I still listen to this album to this date! this is a great album it has this type of style to it that is so original I call this album a good solid POP album that has realy good songs!and if you are intrested in to pop songs check this out.
1,Why?,"Okay, honestly... why are modern ""musicians"" giving music a bad name? It's obvious that they think it's just a beauty contest. Fine, if Spears really wants fame, she should become a model - but if she doesn't write all her music, she doesn't play an instrument, and she doesn't sing very well, SHE'S NOT MEANT TO BE CALLED A MUSICIAN! For all of you Britney fans out there, you need to open your eyes! I wouldn't have given this any stars, but it's not possible to give less than one. Too bad....."
5,TOTALLY GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LOL!!! I like Britney's songs, but I don't take her for an idol yet. Anyway, this CD contains great songs sung by Britney (duh). My favourites r:I'm a Slave 4 U*Overprotected*Lonely*Cinderella*I Run Away*I'm not a girl, not yet a woman*I'm tellin' ya, these songs should not be missed!"
5,More Mature Than Her Past Albums!,"Britney's new CD is great! I love all the songs! When I first heard ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" on the radio, I didn't think it was that good. And the music video wasn't all that great either. I was expectiong the album to be her worst. But I love every song! It took me a while to get used to ""Slave"" but all the other songs are so good, you forget about it. The truely great songs are ""Overprotected"", ""lonely"", ""I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet A Woman"", ""Bombastic Love"", and ""What it's Like To Be Me"" wich was written by Britney's Boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, who you can hear singing backup. Her cover of the classic ""I Love Rock N' Roll"" is also very good. If you enjoyed Britney's past CD's or if you like NSYNC, you're sure to love this album!"
5,Very good,"This Britney Spears album called Britney really puts me in a great mood. All these upbeat songs make me dance and put a smile on my face. My two favorites are 'I'm A Slave 4 U, and 'Cinderella.' 'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman' is beautiful. I sort of like her version of 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll,' but I don't know why she had to remake that one. Every track on here is great, and she has a pretty voice. I recommend this album."
2,Disappointing,"For me, this is a big disappointment. I have both previous Britney albums, and have enjoyed them immensely, especially her debut album. But this, what is supposed to be a musical departure, doesnt sound that different and certainly doesnt contain a lot of the melodies that attracted me to Britney in the first place.'Slave' is interesting, and yes, is a more mature style for her. My favourite track on the album is 'Boys' but hey, there is such a similarity between this and Prince's 'Get Off'.A disappointing album, but I am not writing her off yet.One for the fans I think..."
1,Junk,"Britney Spears is living proof that sex sells because outside of those blonde locks, and silicone implants there really isn't any talent. Let's face it this isn't someone that's going to get deep and heavy about E=MC^2 any time soon. Most of what she has going for her is superficial, or prefabricated by either her management or her high paid handlers. Hopefully her next album 'Zone' will have a song or two that hints at her relationship with her ex-Justin Timberflake. If not 'Zone' could have a hole in it bigger than the ozone."
3,Good.... not great,"Britney is a good album... there are some great songs like ""Slave 4 U"", ""Overprotected"" ""Cinderella"" (both written by Max Martin), ""Not a girl not yet a woman"" (written by max martin & Dido) or ""Boys"". You will also listen to cover of the oldie ""I love rock and roll"" wich is not so good and Justin Timberlake's voice in the last track which was written by him and Wade Robson (Britney's and N'sync coreographer, both wrote N'sync's hit ""POP"").""Britney"" is good, but could have been better, if you are expecting to find more songs like ""Slave 4 U"", you won't...Britney's 3rd album is pure POP."
4,Best One Yet!!,"Britney sure has grown over her albums. I have heard all of them and I love them. This one is awesome compared to the others. My favorie tracks are:I'm A Slave 4 UOverprotectedBombastic LoveBoysTheir are some others. I got this cd wrapped up for my Christmas gift and I can't wait to open it. Although I have saw it. Britney Spears is awesome. I hope she makes a new record as well. I love the cover and the back side. It's a new Britney. I can't wait to see if I can get the Britney Spears-Britney: The Videos the DVD. It has all the behind-the-scene footage and Bonus features. All I can say is that this is A great album. I gave it 4 stars because some songs were just not there such as ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" I really don't like this song, but the Cinderella song on the album is good as well! Great Job Britney! You're Growing Up TO Fast!"
4,Buy Now Regret Later!,"Now I'm a partial britney fan, I cannot say I completely love her or hater. After one listen to this record theres no doubt that britney is growing up and desperately trieng to establish herself as a true Artist and she's half way there with this record. This album lacks Baby One More Time's sweet ballads like ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"" and ""Email My Heart"". But yet has Oop's I did it again's uptempo strong points like ""Stronger"" and ""What U See Is What You Get"". So if your one of those chosen few who don't regret, than just buy the album and think later!"
1,God! Britney please! You suck!,"Puh-leaze! Get a life, Britney you are nothing but a trash! Guess what, Britney??? I only like ONE song of yours is ""Sometimes"" but the other rest SUCKS! I think you need to quit a singer because you are nothing but a trash! Go get some help! You tried to be sexy, you tried to show off that you are a HOT looking and so on but please - your ugly as hell. All Britney the nasty freak fool fans - sorry about this message but she is not worth my time so PEACE!"
1,This Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Britney is the worst singer in the universe! She does very discusting things! She is not a good role model. Please take my word for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,Britney... Not What I Expected..... A Bit Tarty,"1. I'm a Slave 4 U 1/52. Overprotected 4/53. Lonely 1/54. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman 4/55. Boys 2/56. Anticipating 1/57. I Love Rock and Roll 1/58. Cinderella 1/59. Let Me Be 1/510. Bombastic Love 3/511. That's Where You Take Me 4/512. When I Found You 4/513. Before the Goodbye 5/514. What It's Like to Be Me 1/5"
5,Excellent,"Can Britney do no wrong, admitidly shes not to everyones taste, but if you dont like it then dont listen. This is Britney's third album and her best to date, thst is constantly good all of the way through. The standout tracks on this labum are Slave To U, Let Me Be, Boombastic Love, Boys and I Love Rock N Roll. This cd has showed that Britney has the staying power and is still adored by millions all around the globe"
5,Just the best...,"This is my favorite cd of all time, all the songs are amazing, its weird tough, because in every album that I've bought, there's a couple of songs that i don't like it, but this is the only one that I've like ALL THE SONGS, you have to buy it, even if it's not completely recent, my favorites are: Slave, Overprotected, not a girl, lonely, cinderella, and let me be."
2,"Folks, this missed the bulls-eye","Just look at the picture on the CD. The image she conveys to the teenagers throughout the world that listen to her music is becoming worse. The innocence of the ""Baby One More Time"" album is lost, and an indescribable feeling of disgust swells over me at the sight of fashion styles on the front cover.It should be noted that her music is also degrading in quality. The tunes that delivered a message and could be hummed repeatedly in her first album have evolved to the newer songs including ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" that deliver no message (poor lyrics). Britney's a great dancer, but if the music seems bland, it's very important to ask yourself a question whether you're buying: because of her publicity and image or because you truly like the music.Folks, this album has hit blank space. Her voice in this album definitely lacks the resonance of previous albums, and I strongly do not suggest this. A true blow to pop culture."
2,Uncreative album title,"I spend a lot of time with my friend's daughters, so it helps me keep my finger on the pulse of today's youth.THIS is good music by today's standards?Okay, okay- I'll admit that when they played the cd for me, it got my booty shaking a little bit. But no individual songs stood out as being very good....P>Guys like Britney for obvious reasons. Young girls look up to her, somewhat perversely, as a role model. But us middle aged women are left wondering what all the fuss is about."
1,Another Yawner,"Once again, Britney has unleashed her tedious muck upon the world. No doubt every 9-12 year old girl with hormone problems will desire to own this one, plus its companions in the upcoming merchandising campaign. At least it has educational value--At least this way, our young future women will know how to behave like (...). I don't have any particular problem with Ms. Spears, and this is because my problem is with the music, which she has absolutely nothing to do with. If there were actual instruments on her albums, they might be bearable, but they are merely an incessant cascade of bleeps and bloops and electronically synthesized mediocrity."
2,not great,"love brit. but didn't really like this album. i did like i'm a slave for you; i like anything produced by the neptunes. advice to brit: if you really want to make a big comeback, simply go in the studio with the hottest producers: NEPTUNES, Timbaland, and Sean Garrett."
4,Britney's slowly growing up!,"Now Britney Spears has a hot, sexy, more matue new image. Her maturity has also become more edvident in her vocal ability. Music wise the sound of this album is not as different in style to the last album (Oops!...) as I was expecting. Neverless this is a great album for the tyical Britney fan."
3,"Britney, Britney, Britney","I think that this CD overall isn't that bad, but it could be better. True I'm not an avid Britney Spears fan, but I do own her albums and listen to them occasionally (esp. 'Where Are You Now'), but I think that she could've done a bit better and is probably going to disappoint some of her fans that are expecting more '...Baby One More Time' & 'Oops!...I Did It Again' songs. But there are some ai-ight tracks on here, ('I'm A Slave 4 U,' 'Anticipating,' 'Boys', etc.), just not enough of them."
4,Brit's moving up,Britney has definately shown that in this world today she is indeed growing and moving up. Album is good. Could be her best...you decide.
3,Britney does good in her third effort,"Even though she is insisting in that she has grown up and that ""I Am Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"", Britney Spears has not grown up musically or vocally in any sense. ""Britney"" sounds pretty similar to her previous album ""Oops!...I Did It Again"", it has lots of fun to listen upbeat pop tracks like the first single ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", ""Overprotected"", ""Lonely"" and ""Cinderella"" and one or two ballads. I'm not saying I don't like the album, if I didn't I would not have given it 4 stars. It is cool to listen and the lyrics are catchy, what a good pop album is supposed to have. But if you think you are going to find a ""mature"" or deeper Britney, look somewhere else cause you won't find it here."
5,Makes a great little bean pot as well...,"I bought my first Le Creuset set in NY over 20 years ago. I have since obtained a new piece every few years. This little soup pot is one of my favorites. I love to cook flavorful bean recipes and this pot makes it so easy. I just saute onions, garlic, peppers, meats or spices first, then empty in the beans and liquid and leave it alone for 45 minutes to an hour on low. So easy to use and so easy to clean. A great little soup (and bean) pot at a great price."
4,Oddly timeless in many ways,Some parts of this book give an incredible insight into the way life was actually lived all western Europe and the middle east in the 1800s. Other parts give testament to Twain's incredibly casual bigotry and racism and intolerance. But in one page he'll note his desire to not appear ignorant in front of a freed slave acting as tour guide in Venice; and then widely compliment the fellow for his intelligence and manner. Twain doesn't smooth the rough edges - he's all rough edges. But so much the better.
2,I did not find it interesting,There was really nothing to see and I did not see the benefit of watching this. When I first clicked on it I thought it was the actual movie and soon found it wasn't!!!
1,This Is Not A Movie Only A Public Relations Clip,This is not the movie but only some public relations clip. Total waste of time. This is the type of video you'd expect to see on youtube and not on a movie streaming service.
4,was ok,"I didnt watch the whole thing because it was on my computer and the screen isnt very big, but i do like the xmen series."
4,DOES NOT DISAPPOINT,I liked this movie very much. It was worthy of the fantasy series and will be watching it one more time
3,World Premiere - X-Men Origins: Wolverine - So-So!,"I watched it and thought it ""okay!"" I guess I was expecting more. Standard background info. Nothing really revealing or new, but worth a watch!"
4,X-Men,"Interesting look at the birth of one of Marvels most Iconic charecters, when the claws come out you better run."
1,waste of time,"A waste of time from signing in to the final click on the ""play"" button. A seven minute teaser trailer that is a red carpet affair. It is red carpet premier for the movie that was taped as part of a promo spot on the FOX network movie channel. Don't waste your time."
1,I hate it,I originally downloaded this item thinking it was the movie. It wasn't and I was disappointed. Why waste the time to put a 7 minute clip or interview out there?
1,Not the movie,I was so disappointed to see it was not the movie. So I would not recamend this product To any one
2,not what I expected,"Well.....it's my own fault I suppose..but I was perhaps mistaken,as to what this video was...I thought it was going to be a behind the scenes look,at the making of Wolverine...instead it turned out to be basically,a shortened version,of a red carpet awards show...at least by being an Amazon Prime member,it didnt cost me anything...and that's about what it's worth...sorry....."
1,Pthtthhth,"Just put the movies, thanx. Silly me I thought they were actually offering a cool movie on Prime for free."
1,This is Not A Movie,"I thought I was getting a movie to watch but no, it's just an advertisement or a short documentary. Waster of time."
2,Thought I was renting a movie...,I thought I was renting a movie. It was just about the crowds of people at the opening of the show.
4,Kids Grafeeteez Sneaker,My son really likes these shoes and receives compliments from his school friends. I like the fact that the seller sends directly to APO addresses.
5,Comb Set,The combs I bought fit my Andis Clippers Perfect. They worked great on my Shih Tzu's Long coat with a few mats that I did miss. Very easy to use even if your are a first time user at clipping your own pets hair. I would recommend these if you need different combs for the Coat on your Pet.
4,Wrong item pictured in description,"These combs are excellent quality. However, there is no description of what length or what size they are. The photo shows a #7 comb. From that you would assume that the set includes a number 7 comb. Not true. They are the longer set of combs and are lettered alphabetically, not numbered as shown in the photo of the item. After receiving these I decided to keep them. One or two will work on the body of my Havanese dog, but most are too long. After receiving these and realizing they are the longer combs, I ordered the small animal combs for the Andis. Just so future shoppers know, the Andis Universal Animal Clipper Combs are the longer set. The Small Animal combs fit the same clippers but are the shorter set of combs. Both are excellent."
3,Clipper Combos,"Purchased these to go with our Andis Clipper.I would have liked the set better if it had two more smaller blade guides as well.The tricky and cool things about things guys is they are spring-loaded, so to speak. At first I didn't think they fit the Clipper, but then I realized after you have it hooked on at the blade you simply pull to extend it to fit!! This is cool!!Happy clipping!!"
3,Great for the novice groomer,These are excellent guides for the novice & home groomer. The quality of the plastic could be better & the attachment clips are made of inferior metal. I would not expect them to last if they were used heavily. I could expect to get a reasonable amount of use out of these combs/guides.
4,Andis Snap on Combs Great for use on Tangle Free Pets,"These work great for clipping My Toy Poodle once he is absolutely TANGLE FREE!.They gave an even cut for me as an inexperienced groomer, once I got out ever single tiny tangle. Use a scissors, or matt rake first, comb out well, then these work quickly and well. They did cut through a few very small tangles on my small straight haired dog, but would get caught up if the tangles had any size to them. I like the variety of sizes in the pack, and they easily clipped on over my Andis 30 blade. Represented well by the manufacture statement."
2,Cheap - and that is what you get.,"Great idea, but don't waste your money. Get the ""best"" ones, rather than these. They are very flimsy and will not go through the hair of a cocker spaniel. There is another brand that is 2-3 times heavier and works well (but they are also 8 times the price!) Just be aware of what you are getting."
1,Horrible--waste of $,"I bought this set. Yuck. While technically the combs fit Andis AGC (1-speed) and AGC2 (2-speed), I don't recommend them. The combs ""stretch"" and are very difficult to attach to the blade. Nearly sliced my hand several times. Sharp surfaces where easy to cut hands. Would need to wear leather gloves to get combs on. Not recommended for Andis AGC and AGC2. Going in garbage. Waste of $."
1,Unhappy,I had read that it fit a size ten blade which my trimmer has and these did not fit. Was happy that without a hassle I could return them
2,Hard to use.,I had a very difficult time getting these combs to attatch to the blade of my Andis clippers. It made the grooming job tough.
1,Does not fit the Andis I just bought,The combs do not fit the average Andis shaver heads I wanted them to fit on. Very disappointing.
2,Not so great,"They are ok, but not worth the money. I groom up to 8 dogs a day 5 days a week and these failed me completely. Even the tiniest little knot and they won't go through. I don't have time for that!"
3,Take care with the sharp tips of these guides,Nice spring loaded attachment for these cutting guides.Take care to avoid catching the tips of the teeth on the skin of your animal. These teeth tips are far sharper than the set that came with my Andis clipper.
3,the work okay,These combs fit the clippers and work as well as most other plastic clipper combs. My only complaint is that one of combs pops off occasionally. Maybe the spring is a little loose.
1,Flimsy Combs,"These are very flimsy. They fit on the clipper well, but the thin plastic tines bend all over the place. They have a sharp point at the end which inadvertently will jab the dog a few times during the grooming no matter how careful you are. Don't know why Andis would want to put their name on these flimsy combs. I have lately seen much studier ones which do not have as sharp a point. Spend a little more and get something that actually works."
3,The Riddle of the Rosetta Stone,"The Rosetta Stone, found in Egypt in 1799 by the French but later turned over to the British, contains text written in three alphabets: Greek, Egyptian, and hieroglyphics. Decoding the hieroglyphics on the stone remained a puzzle to many experts for years. This book provides a biography of the stone, describing the contributions made by many linguists that eventually led to deciphering the mysterious symbols.Black and white photographs of the stone as well as portrait illustrations of the men who helped decode the symbols break up the text. The book provides a very informative history of the writing system of ancient Egypt."
3,Beyond Words,"I bought this book for my mother as she liked the art work by the artist. I wasnt really pleased with the book , it wasnt what I had thought it was going to be and I never gave it to her."
4,A thought-provoking read,"Of the five sections in this book of essays, I can say that I most enjoyed ""A View from the Window,"" an undersized overview of the now-defunct twentieth century, and ""Brodsky in New York,"" which profiles the great Russian/American poet; the section ""Red Bread"" puts the peculiarities of Russian cuisine into a historical context; and the crux of the book, ""USA from A to Y""--an observant portrayal of those everyday Americanisms that we ourselves tend to overlook--will also be interesting for wordly readers, especially those who are not used to looking at their own culture from without. Alas, I felt the last section, ""Darkness and Silence,"" to be the weakest in the collection and was unable to delve very deeply into it. Still, I can recommend this book highly. The translations are refreshingly un-translationlike, and Mr. Genis himself is a very fine writer."
5,Today's DeToqueville,"This handsome book of collected essays by the expatriate genius from New York is really worth your time. Alexander Genis, a Russian living in the big apple, contributes to a field where the maestro is Alexis DeToqueville, the colonial French author who reviewed and explained America to Americans. However, this Americanology through a Russian eye is but one of several excellent pieces. ""Darkness and Silence"" is an exquisitely subtle piece which belongs to no nation- it is a cosmopolitan, intricate piece of philosophy, delving into the art of living in real time. Alexander Genis is obviously a master in the high genre of Criticism, but this particular work demonstrates his place in world literature !"
3,Acceptable,"This video features children performing several basic yoga postures and a few breathing exercises. The children in the video seem to have fun, and are of varying ages. My one complaint about this video is that the instructor (whose voice you hear; she doesn't perform the postures with the children) seems a bit uncomfortable in her role; her voice is rehearsed, not at all natural. I do believe that children new to yoga may enjoy this video, but will probably tire of it quickly."
1,Was this really a coat??,Wouldn't waste my time or effort in purchasing this unless you are willing to purchase all of the jackets needed to make a coat. Very disappointed and not what I call a Big Down Jacket. For the sale price I didn't expect a North Pole worthy coat but certainly better than this.
2,Red Eye -- Red Eye ...,"I had a Ricoh 35mm for about 12 years (I loved that camera - I took it everywhere). It finally just broke. I needed a new camera - after many hours of research we decided to buy a canon. We bought the 85 and the 120. We took identical pictures with both cameras. The 85 had red eye problems even when the red-eye function was on. The 120 has similar but fewer red-eye problems. The color and crispness was beautiful. However, the red-eye simply ruins the photos. I never used the red-eye function on my Ricoh - and when reviewing my last few hundred photos - I noticed that I never had red-eye. I'm so dissapointed that Ricoh no longer sells the 35mm. I returned both cameras. I am now stuck with no camera. Do not buy a canon buy this camera!"
3,Not much value for the 'kit',"Don't waste the extra $30 for the kit version of this camera. The sholder strap is more like a necklace and the only other added components are a cary case that is only big enough for the camera and will hold nothing else and 1 roll of film.This camera has been declare as a best buy from Consumer Reports so you cannot go wrong with the unit itself, but don't expect to be impressed at all with the added pieces in the 'kit'.Stick with the camera alone for ..."
3,"Red eye reduction? Yeah, right.....","I bought this camera based on Canon's good reputation and also the fact that it received good ratings from Consumer Reports. Though the camera takes good, sharp pictures outside in the daylight, the red eye reduction feature is completely worthless when using the flash. I have had the camera for four months and have taken several pictures with it, including ones from a recent vacation. I am disappointed in the way many of the pictures where I used the red eye reduction feature turned out. The camera itself is very easy to use and lightweight, however, I would not have chosen it if I knew in advance how poorly the red eye reduction works. I guess in the future, I will have to stick with 400 speed film and no flash in low light conditions."
1,don't bother with this camera,"This camera is a piece of crap! I had a Nikon many years ago that I foolishly sold, for this more ""Easy to use"" Sure Shot. It should be called the Sure Sucks. Red eye everywhere even when the function is turned on, and the ""auto focus"" when shooting indoors in low light is terrible. This ""hold button halfway down, then wait for the light, then shoot"" garbage is ridiculous in today's technology. I am selling this as quickly as I can and am truly disappointed in the Canon name- which I trusted when I bought this camera."
5,Sophisticated and Inspiring,"This is not your ordinary show and tell book. The projects are sophisticated and inspiring. Instructions are comprehensive and easy to follow even for a beginner, but an advanced quilter would be impressed and could learn a thing or two."
4,journey of an Art Quilter,"Love the book.. but need to advise that it is for an advanced quilter.. not for a beginner...personally, I loved it..."
4,Journey of an Art Quilter,"This is an excellent book for those who wish to make more than regular quilts. I love art quilts. the book was not exactely what I wanted, but is very good."
2,Reversable duvet cover?,Description says reverses to Ithica Stripe pattern. There is nothing on the reverse side of this comforter other than the back side of the denim. Since it says it is reversable I assumed I was getting two comforters for the price of one so I am a little disappointed however the denim side is very nice.
3,A little disappointed,"Received the two twin duvet covers I ordered in a timely manner. Was a little disappointed that it is only denim on ONE side, not two. The second side has a thin, navy, sheet-like material on it. A little worried about how it will hold up. Had ordered the Ralph Lauren ones off their site and liked them better but one had stains on it and they couldn't locate a replacement anywhere or tell me if they were going to get any more. Had to return those.There is no ""Ithaca stripe pattern."" It's denim on one side and that thin navy material (like a thin sheet) on the reverse side."
2,Duvet cover,"I like the color and weight of this duvet, but the size is terrible. I bought it for a queen size mattress and it does not adequately cover the bed. The width is not even close to covering the sides of the bed well. I would prefer to be able to buy queen size and not full/queen but, that seem to be hard to come by."
5,An amazing read!,"Sometimes it makes me wonder what book people are reading when I look at other reviews. I have more than 20 books on Zappa and this is the most amazing collection of Zappa information ever compiled. Since more than half of the information in this book has not appeared elsewhere, it was certainly not cut and pasted from another book. It is, in fact, Neil Slaven's book which is rife with errors. This book, in a convincing fashion, proves Slaven wrong time after time with the documentation enclosed within. Why can't other books be put together like this one? If you want to learn about Zappa, this is the place to go after you purchase Frank's book. It should also be noted that the author of ""Cosmik Debris"" was also greatly involved with the Original Sound CD reissue of Frank's earliest recordings. No other FZ book author can claim this on their resume. I would suggest that all FZ fans buy the book now!"
2,Well...it's concise.,"Russo's prose, admittedly is better than Walley's, but the text is essentially a watered down version of Slavin's superior biography. The only interesting aspects of the book are collected newspaper clippings (most of which are illegible) and assorted photos, although they feature none of the bands from the latee 70s and 80s. By far the worst aspect of the book though is Russo's attempts at deciphering conceptual continuity, which run: '""Zomby Woof"" is a corruption of ""Zombie Wolf""' No! Really? Wow, how insightful. And '""Evelyn, a Modified Poodle"" was yet another canine reference.' If you've read any other bio, this is relatively useless, and far too expensive for what it includes."
2,DULL,"This book has its place. If you're looking for a very complete reference of Zappa recordings and band personnel changes here it is. But this is not much of a biography apart from a few key facts about schooling, kids' birthdates and such. There are no quotes, and only the most succinct and dry accounts of events. There's a great deal of shallow ""sidebar"" material on the order of ""the single release was a 1:05 longer than the album"". If that's what you're after, go to town, but look elsewhere for a serious (or humorous for that matter) Zappa biography."
2,Great Story Poorly Told,"Simon Winchester bumbles through a great piece of history with the occasional interjection of small tidbits of verbosity intended, one might guess, to hide his lack of craft. A look at this books sale history, however, will give you the long and the short of it: the story, the events, are fascinating. This is, therefore, a good book for the beach, bus, or bathroom."
2,Shouldn't have been a book,"This would have made a great article for The New Yorker. The story of Dr. Minor is fascinating but not large enough for a book. As a result, Winchester's book is full of padding, such as unnecessary and pedantic discussions about insanity as a criminal defense and the strides made in modern mental health. Winchester also commits numerous inaccuracies in his references to orthography, grammar and usage; which is ironic, considering that he's writing about a work which is one of our arbitors of correct English. Winchester is a pop writer, not a scholar, and in this book, it shows."
5,"wonderful, strange, depressing and funny","This book leaves me with a myriad of emotions! It is quite depressing about one man's passion and his madness. It is a wonderful study of a man obsessed words. And yet, at times I found it darkly humorous. I mean if you were working on a project that would take 70 years, you would never see finished in your lifetime, you were trying to catalogue EVERY word in the English language, the origins and variations, and do this in the 1800's when there was no computers - no typewriters....well, you would HAVE to be mad.So if you have ever used a dictionary, you need to read this. It will give you a new appreciation of the book of words."
5,Great Story!,I was suspicious at first. A tale about the making of a dictionary? However as the story continued it drew more and more interesting. This is a compelling tale about a professor and a madman. It deals not only with the details of the creation of the OED but the blood sweat and tears that went into it and the psychology of the madman that contributed so much to it's completetion.
3,A stretched out short story,"I agree with cabate2. But I gave it 3 stars because it was interesting. However, the story was not booklength. I value conciseness, succinctness, terseness, and pithiness. Not redundancy, as you can see."
3,"Interesting story, but boring at times","I was fully looking forward to reading this title, but what I found was a well-researched and interesting plot, but a lack of riveting progression through the book. I believe there is nothing wrong with the substance itself, for I thought that was very intriguing. However, the style in which it was presented was somewhat boring. Thats not to say the story of the Professor and the Madman is boring, but only the presentation was a little on the dull side. Therefore, if you wish to learn of the backround of the OED and the two principal characters behind it, this title is very informative in that aspect."
4,The Professor and the Madman,"I agree with most of the positive comments on the book and certainly enjoyed the facinating story. However, as a professional editor, I was not impressed with the publisher's shoddy proofreading and copyediting of the book. While reading it, I found myself continually stumbling over typos and obvious errors in grammar and punctuation.Now, I'm sure that many people reading my comments will think that I'm just being picky. But, don't you think it's ironic that a book that focuses on one of the greatest, most scholarly literary efforts in history should undergo such careless proofreading? Just imagine what James Murray would think. I believe he'd be horrified at such inattention."
4,Extraordinary Insanity,"I love words--the way they slide off your fingertips letter-by-letter and dance on the screen in front you; the way they roll from your tongue out into shared space. I also love the history of words, the meanings behind the words we use--yet never before have I loved the HISTORY of a DICTIONARY. Odd thing to read about, yes? No.This book is a fantastic history of the evolution of the greatest English dictionary ever created. More fabulously, it details the friendship between two men--both with unique minds--and how that friendship influenced their lives and the dictionary.A good (and thin) read. And with a bonus ""call for readers"" at the end, we are given chance to contribute. Although it's doubtful that any single person could contribute half as much as the ""Madman"" did."
4,You Will Be Amazed,"In my parents home on the bookshelf is the complete Oxford English Dictionary - two huge volumes that come with their own magnifying glass, due to the mass of words crammed onto the pages in tiny print. Every word in the English language! Growing up, I never thought about how this mammoth dictionary was written! THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN, on the other hand, is a slim book, one that does not take much time to read, but it chronicles the amazing story of how the OED came into being. But it is also more than that - it's the true story of people who devoted their time and energy to pursuing something, to a process, to a goal. It's about the human desire to accomplish something before we die. The need to DO something, however insignificant or impossible it seems. It's a fascinating story."
2,"Interesting for an article, too little for a book","This book, while fairly interesting in terms of plot, really only has enough material in it for a short article. There are perhaps three events of note in the entire book, one of which is well-known from the outset.I was disappointed - but then I prefer well written fiction to mediocrely written faction."
3,Words,"This a book of moderate interest. The content could well have been covered well in a New Yorker or Atlantic length article. Some stories appear more than once. Several postscripts seem to bear out the notion that the author had need to fill more pages than the story demanded. Also annoying where several anachronisms, such as traveling in the Indian Ocean on tramp steamers in the 1830's and ""switching on the lights"" in the 1870's. Overall it is an amusing read, but not of four or five star quality"
3,Two Worlds Collide with a Whimper,"The Professor and the Madman does its best work when it: (a) provides a history of the Oxford English Dictionary and the monumental efforts needed to produce it. This alone makes parts of the book interesting reading; and (b) builds towards the meeting of Drs. Murray and Minor. From the narrative of the book, you expect some type of fireworks when the meeting occurs, but my reaction to this scene was ""Ok, what's next?"" The story raised my hopes for an interesting conclusion to the book, but it fizzled, rather than dazzled."
3,O for a better writer!,"The author stretches material sufficient for a New Yorker article into an entire book, filling in the gaps with speculation. An example of this is the small section where the author speculates on whether Dr. Minor and the wife of his murdered victim engaged in an affair or thought about engaging in an affair and proposes this as a cause for Dr. Minor's self-mutilation, while admitting there exists no evidence to this effect. The material required better scholarship, writing and focus to truly make it come alive. This book is still an enjoyable and quick read, but does not give the material the treatment it deserves."
1,Painfully Boring,"There aren't enough words in the Oxford English Dictionary to describe my loathing for this book. It is constantly being recommended to me, because I apparently fit the stereotype of someone who would like it(I have an English degree, I enjoy reading, and I am a bit of a language maven). As someone who loves books, I am usually offended when others complain that a book is ""boring."" Having said that, my main criticism with The Professor and the Madman is that it is painfully and shockingly ... boring. The only reason I was able to finish this book is that I was trapped in a cabin during a snowstorm. My options were to either read this book or stare out into a blank white landscape.I should have stared into the landscape. A more accurate title would have been: The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Letters Being Exchanged, Bureaucracy, and Conversations About Minutiae."
1,a waste of time!,"I completely agree with the critic who suggested that this book would be much better off being a long magazine article. It's boring, it drags on and is not very well written at all. If someone asked me what the book was about, I'd be able to narrate the entire story in 2 minutes and save them the ordeal of actually READING the book!This book really was a waste of my time!"
4,The story behind the OED,"Winchester's thoroughly researched history of two of the most notable men involved in the making of the OED is a fascinating and scholarly work. It is a bit tangential at times; however, within this construct, the overall direction and meaning of the work is preserved."
4,interesting tale --- but no mystery,"Good tale. However, back of book tells about 70% of the tale. Worth reading for the details of how OED was written."
4,A Wonderful Story about Language and Madness,"I guarantee you that once you finish this book, you will not only appreciate the work that went into the Oxford English Dictionary, but you will also be searching for a CD-ROM copy of it. Even though it is non-fiction, it reads like a novel and is supported by intricate research and written well enough to qualify as prose. I label this book a must read for anyone interested in language or writing."
3,Excellent but light reading,"I enjoyed the style of the author (lucid writing, excellent vocabulary, erudite interesting asides) and the elements of the story (insanity, murder, academia, the lexicon); this book had all the ingredients of an umberto-ecco-esque thriller. But a fiction author has control over the story, can bring all these strands together in a meaningful way. Simon Winchester, however, can only record what happened, and in what happened these great parts just don't come together into a whole. Or if they do, it's in a way too subtle for me to grasp. So what is left is a very entertaining but rather disjointed and shallow contraption."
3,Interesting but somewhat of a hard read,"I found the backgrounds of the two men featured in this book to be interesting. I also found the process used to write the OED fascinating. But, all in all, I found this book easy to put down and hard to get through. It did not captivate me."
4,Fascinating,"This one comes under the heading of ""brain food"" for me. A really interesting story, and despite its subject matter, never too dry. If you feel like getting a bit of learnin', this could be just the book for you!"
4,Enjoyable historical story,"I found this book to be extremely interesting (so much so that I finished reading it in a day). The only problem I had was the writing style of the author. He tends to write in run-on sentences, and I found this to be slightly distracting. For example, one sentence from page 82 is as follows: ""And more-if he wasn't precisely sure that he was giving his Sebastian the proper reference for his lines-for was the inn really likely to be named after an elephant, or was it perhaps named after another animal, a camel or a rhino, or a gnu?-where could he look to make sure?"" I didn't notice any other reviewers who had complained about this, so most people must have not been bothered by his writing style.Overall I enjoyed this book and I recommend it to people who are interested in reading a light historical novel."
4,fascinating look at the history of English dictionaries,"Simon Winchester takes a seemingly boring subject, the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary and ends up with an entertaining tale of the origins of words and their meanings. Interspersed in his story are highly entertaining vignettes of murder, war and madness. Good reading."
3,Slow,"I did like this book and would have given it 3.5 stars is I could. The history was interesting and easy to get through, even for a casual reader of histories such as myself. However, for some reason I felt like I was dragging myself through parts. I am unable to put my finger on it, but some parts were just really slow for me. I would recomend that you read this book if for no reason than it is full of interesting facts that may come in handy at a cocktail party. In all seriousness, I did like it but read it on vacation so you can cruise through the slow parts."
4,pretty not bad,"Makes a great story about insanity and the human potential. Genius is inextricably linked to madness in the interaction of different characters and also in a single individual. Books like this are fascinating because they take everyday objects and bring them into a historical context--every time I use my dictionary now I think of the story behind it, and how that may only be the tip of the iceberg. Wincester's prose is manageable for the most part--sometimes it doesn't flow smoothely, but one doesn't have to plow too strenuously to get through this fairly short book. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in madness and/or the origins of household objects we take for granted."
4,Dictionary - suprisingly interesting,"This book was recommened to me by a person that to me has a great taste in books so I bought it. At first I was thinking maybe the same thing that you are, a book about a dictionary, how incredibly boring. But it really is quite interesting. I had never heard of the Oxford English Dictionary and therefore knew nothing about there being a story behind it or that the story of it's making is so fascinating. It is not all about the dictionary but more about the two main forces, two people, that helped create this book. I like this approach a lot because this way you don't get bogged down in the book, which nobody wants. At least try it, it's a suprisingly intriguing book."
4,Intriguing Read!,"I read this book for one of my classes in grad school. It is an amazing book. It was difficult for me to get through the areas of discussing the OED, but overall a great book.The author takes you into the life of Dr. Minor who is a genius, but is also clinically insane. It appears he had some sort of paranoid schizophrenia although I do not believe they ever come out and say exactly what it was he had (as they just declared everyone insane at that time). Dr. Minor was a great contributor to the Oxford English Dictionary, but had many inner demons he fought for the majority of his life.You learn a little about the inner workings of the mental hospitals at the time as well. I encourage those of you who are into history as well as mystery to read this book. A good read also for those who are interested or are currently in school for psychology."
4,Charming,"One of the most fascinating book on the OED, This was such a fun read and so well written. Highly recommened."
3,"Too much for an article, too little for a book","I agree with another reviewer that this book is a bit on the lightweight side for an entire book-length treatment, and the author indulges in a fair amount of off-the-cuff speculation, with no footnoted basis in fact, for many elements, such as the probable basis for the ""madman's"" fantasies and obsessions. However, when Winchester hits a groove, he can write wonderful, lyrical prose -- I loved the bit about his acquaintance, who printed a set of pages from his page-plate of the Dictionary. A great read for bibiophiles and lovers of dictionaries."
3,probably not as good as the hype,"This book is probably not as good as the hype surrounding it, particularly because it centers on the sad and pathetic figure of Dr. William Minor who was truly mad, a madness that caused him and society some most unfortunate consequences, most obviously his incarceration in a British insane asylum for murder. I don't think it is necessarily in society's best interest to focus so much attention as this book does on a certifiable madman, and call him some kind of a intellectual hero, as Winchester attempts to do. Perhaps Van Gogh was another such case, but I consider this an unkind sort of mockery. Perhaps his family is making some money off the book, but if I were them, I wouldn't want it advertised to the public. On the other hand, according to the book, his victim's widow did visit Dr. Minor late in life, so she at least apparently forgave him."
5,An intriguing and fun tale,"What a spectacular book. Anyone who is interested in the lexicographical arts will love this book. Anyone who likes a well crafted story will like it also. I devoured this book in two nights. I could have gone the rest of my life without knowing what an autopeotomy is, but is you are interested in what one is, read the book!"
3,peaks early,"This book is well written and pulls the reader in. Unfortunatley after about the first few pages of the story, it begins to spiral inward explaining nuances of the story that are no longer that interesting (and are already clearly understandable in the larger summary). I recommend reading the first few chapters and then quitting."
2,"Yawn, yawn - I'd rather read a dictionary!",It's an interesting story. Pity the telling of it was so un-interesting.
3,Ancedotes of History,"Is this really worth a book?That is a question worth answering. It is a single but interesting ancedote filled with trivia about mental illness, Civil War justice, the history of dictionaries, and finally self-mutilation."
2,The Professor and the Madman,"This book relly deserves two stars. It was very ordinary. The sudject itself wasn't very interesting. This was not a real page turner, and I found myself never minding putting it down. Although it was well written, I kept wanting more. When I was done I did not feel ""disappointed"", but had I had the choice, I wouldn't have read it."
1,A great story trapped in a terrible book,"I love the OED. I read CT Onions' ""Oxford English Dictionary of English Etymologies"" for fun.I couldn't stand this book.Why? The writing is awful. Winchester takes a short story and pads it to a ridiculous degree. Further, his writing is awkward and cliched; it's on the level of a 1950's pulp mystery.Not that there's anything wrong with that. But a book about the creation of one of the best-written dictionaries in the universe should be written with thought and care. Instead, The Professor and the Madman gives one the impression that the author had a page quota to fill.As other reviewers have stated, the real life story didn't have that many events. This story would have been better told in 10 pages rather than 240.Avoid this book unless you enjoy pulp mysteries as much as you enjoy the Oxford English Dictionary."
1,Emperor's new clothes,"Talk about a tulip bulb phenomenon. Everybody loves this book because everybody loves this book. Yes, it has some interesting thoughts, but they are stretched out and repeated to fill space. Nice concept, but more appropriately a magazine or Sunday paper article rather than a whole book."
2,cheated!,"I feel quite cheated having paid for a paperback(yes,we have to pay very highly for the privilege of buying a book)-expecting an entertaining novel as the front and back covers suggested,and instead found I'd spent my money on a poorly written text book!"
3,Good research does not make a good book,"Buy this used- not new, it isn't worthg paying full price. Great subject, the author has definitely done careful research, but it doesn't add up to a particularly interesting book. It keeps going backwards and forwards, from one topic to another. Is it necessary for the author to give a full history of Dictionaries, except to pad the length of the book? Written in a pleasant tone which wavers between the informative and the overly familiar. If you've read one of the magazine articles about this case you already know the story and won't learn much of anything new."
2,"interesting, but boring","Professor and the Madman caught my eye because of it's catchy title and interesting subject matter. However, when I finished reading it I was quite dissapointed. It read much like the history books that I was forced to read during high school, and I feel that the story should've been told in a historial fiction sense rather than a boring, dry history book sense. The information was there, just not presented in an enjoyable way. All in all, I'm glad that I now know what it takes compile a dictionary and that our english dictionary was mostly written by an insane criminal, but I don't feel enlightened after reading this. It was a chore just to finish it."
2,"It sure was ""used"" condition.",I expected used but not abused. The book is readable but the cost did not reflect the poor condition. It was worse than I expected.
1,Someone is messed up!,"I was given an order and billed for this product, even though I had nothing to do with this book and DID NOT ORDER IT. Actually, I sold this book! It took three eMails to get this across to this seller. I still do not understand how this kind of error can even happen. Be careful and check your orders, to make sure you really DID order it."
2,Redundant,"Although the topic was interesting, the writing was unfortunately far too redundant and lengthy, which made the reading experience mildly entertaining at best, but sometimes just plain annoying."
4,A great read,"This is a fascinating story, and well told. I liked the author's writing style and heartily recommend this excellent book."
3,The Professor and the Madman,"Very interesting premise, but many parts are long and drawn out and boring. I still want to complete the read."
5,Fascinating,"One would not expect a history of the Oxford English Dictionary to be particularly interesting, but indeed, there is quite a story behind it. A tremendous amount of the dictionary's research was done by a convicted murderer mired in severe mental illness. This book recounts the strange tale of how W.C. Minor came to write significant portions of the dictionary and, more broadly, how the OED came to be.The OED is undeniably a tremendous achievement. Winchester is clearly enamored of the dictionary; he states unequivocally that the OED is the most important dictionary in human history. He makes little of the various criticisms that have been waged against the dictionary: its orientation towards white, middle class language conventions, its imperialist outlook. Winchester has other interests, and cannot be criticized for that. Still, his dismissal of these criticisms is so absolute that it does make one wonder. Overall, this is a compelling story, enjoyably told."
4,Fascinating Reading,This book will introduce the reader to a whole new way of viewing what we have taken for granted -- the dictionary!
2,disappoint\vb: to fail to fulfill the expectation or hope ~,"The title is misleading as this book is really the about the history of the Oxford English Dictionary. The so-called ""madman"", one of the major contributors to the massive project, does not appear as often as I would have liked. He is a tragic figure, a criminally insane American surgeon who was housed at England's Broadmoor asylum for the majority of his life. Mr. Winchester occasionally uses him as a vehicle to enhance the tale of the lugubrious task of the compilation of one of the English-speaking world's greatest literary achievements. In selecting the book, I'd looked forward to the surgeon's story rather than tiresome text, dates and definitions. The latter, alas, is what I found."
3,professor & madman : OED : : nouveau riche: old money,"I was expecting a more sensational storytelling to accompany what I found to be a sensational title. The tale was sketchily told, with a tendency to become engrossed in the flamboyant use of language that only served, in my opinion, to assist the book in reaching its final length. My curiosity was roused, but not satisfied, by this account. The title really set the level of expectation, and the book fell quite short of delivering the characters it promised. I felt little connection to or sympathy for Mr. Minor and Mr. Murray.It is curious that a fellow researcher of this subject, a playwright who has submitted not one but TWO reviews of this book, refused by his own admission to help Mr. Winchester with his research. Strange that he should make this fact known and yet criticize the author for reporting inaccuracies that he could have rectified pre-publication. Isn't the subject worth telling well?"
4,It is a fascinating biography of one man's incredible life.,"What most reviews of The Professor and the Madman miss is that it is not a story of the creation of a dictionary, but a biography of a man's incredible life and the lessons we can learn from it. Spanning over 85 years, PM tells the story of a troubled man (William Minor) whose childhood begins in America, develops in Sri Lanka, and ends back where it began ... just in time for the Civil War. Serving as a medic, Minor sees - and causes - more pain than he was prepared for, and symptoms of mental illness soon emerge. Shortly thereafter, he goes to England to escape his demons. But alas, he cannot run from them, and in a fit of madness he takes the life of a local laborer. The rest of the story, indeed the bulk of it, deals with Minor's attempt to regain his sanity through his voluntary work on the Oxford English Dictionary. Winchester speculates that the OED would not exist without the critical help of Minor. I concur."
5,Enjoyable account of the creation of a mundane publication.,"It's certain that Mr. Winchester enjoyed researching and documenting the incidents of and about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. He's done a terrific job of weaving together the historical, suspenseful, surprising (and sometimes shocking) events surrounding the production of such a cerebral subject."
3,"Slow-paced, but intriguing account of mental illness","Not nearly as sensational as title would have you think, the book is a careful, even understated account of the creation of the OED. For literature majors, primarily. An intriguing account of the contributions of a most unlikely protagonist--a schizophrenic murderer. Makes you wonder at the thought of prisoners and patients being put to good use, contributing, if at a remove, from the society from which they originated."
4,Superior!!,"Anyone interested in people, the ironies of life, and the history of words will love this book. It is fascinating, riveting, sad, and heartwarming all at the same time."
2,fascinating characters but weak writing and plot,"This could be a fascinating story of two characters whose lives were devoted to writing a dictionary. But, while Minor's life is sketched, the author writes too much speculation about his motivations. The few incidents known about his life are stretched into a full length book when a pamphlet would have sufficed. The style is repetitive and sensational. Apparently the author didn't read what he wrote in the previous chapter, or he wrote them out of order because each repeats what was said earlier."
3,An interesting story but overwritten,Winchester has a really interesting tale to tell here and he tells it and tells it and tells it. No story could stand up to the weight of his prose -- I kept wondering why some editor couldn't have persuaded him to drop one or two subordinate clause per page.
4,Facinating Journey,"What makes this a wonderful read is the fact that it takes what would otherwise be an interesting but dry story (the history and methodology of the dictionary) and wraps it in an exciting story of personal failure and intimate relations. In many ways, this should serve as a model for many who would write non-fiction.By brining together these compeling characters, the author involves us in the details of their lives while at the same time imparting to us considerable knowledge that we would not otherwise recieve.A worth while read for readers and writers alike. Many lessons could be learned by those who beleive that their area of interest is too esoteric. Here is an example of how such subjects can be sucessfully brought to mainstream audiences without dumbing them down."
2,A Failed Story,"The basic story here is good, but I found the writing contrived, opinionated, and in the end, boring. While I enjoyed learning the basic information presented about the OED, and Victorian mental health care, I will never again read anything written by this author."
1,Don't be fooled,"Of course the OED itself is a masterpiece, and the book's cover photo is quite provocative. But the fascinating fact of Dr. Minor's contribution is not *nearly* enough to hang a book on. It shows. The ""drama"" is histrionic and manufactured,Winchester's self-indulgence is stomach turning (see the multi-page acknowledgments section), and everywhere is padding and fluff. Reading one review of the book is a more than adequate substitute for this disappointment."
3,A Few Nice Tidbits + Lots of Padding,"This wildly popular account of the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary is moderately interesting, and reads like an expanded magazine piece. The main story is of two men: the English professor who shepherds the dictionary project, and the American madman who is perhaps its most prolific contributor. There are lots of interesting tidbits including a capsule history of dictionaries, and some excellent research has gone into the book, and while it's a nice story, it ended up feeling a little fluffy to me in the end. Still, worth reading if you are into words."
4,As Exciting As A Book About A Dictionary Can Get,"An interesting, tightly written tale that seems to have distilled the most interesting elements of the OED's saga. The Professor... reads like an adventure book, while in fact the subject matter is pretty much about word-trawling. The book's frothy style and lighthearted tone probably belie the amount of research that apparently went into this work, but make it much more palatable to the reader. This dictionary business is heavy stuff, with men dedicating their entire existences to poring over infinitesimal nuances of language, and it could potentially have made for quite a dry read. I enjoy Winchester's style very much, and found the book educational and interesting without being too weighty."
3,So - So,"The interesting story that hooks you at the beginning of the book turns out to be a myth in the end. I felt a little gypped. But, there were some very interesting things about the making of the dictionary. You just don't think of the process that people go through to create something like the dictionary. I always used to take it for granted. The ""madman"" in the story does something a little disgusting that I would rather not go into detail about. But, other than that, a pretty interesting book."
4,Good Read,"This is narrative history at its best. The book is readable, interesting, and full of solid characterization. I'd argue that the work would make a great gift for a history buff looking for an offbeat topic."
2,This Book Is Not a Keeper,"This is one of the most bizarre and depressing stories I have ever read. The madman's pathology is described in detail, as are the horrific Civil War battle experiences that allegedly drove him crazy. There is a lack of focus as the author alternates between his twin protagonists. Each chapter begins with a selection from the OED, as examples of the tremendous accomplishment this dictionary is. After having used American dictionaries all my life, it does not seem the ultimate in lexicography to have a short definition followed by a long list of usage examples.I very much enjoyed Winchester's account of the explosion of Krakatoa and the making of the geological map of England, but I probably won't buy any more of his books."
1,the professor and the madman,This is the most dryly witten book I have read in a really long time. I have tried to force myself to read it since I am such an avid reader qnd so sincerely wanted to give it a chance. I can force myself to read it no longer after making my way through a third of it. I would not recommend this book to anyone
3,"Excessive use of the word ""moreover""","While the story buried within this slogging narrative is fascinating, the writing is surprisingly poor for a book about the English language. The best books are those where the author's presences is unknown, yet Winchester makes the reader aware of his ""prose"" throughout, and insists upon connecting every dot, excessively pounding out every point, and using parentheticals and dashes to an annoying degree. ""Moreover,"" it's interesting how such great subject matter was laid out in such a dull manner, making it seem like the work of a second year English student who hasn't quite grasped the concept of telling a story in a manner that makes the reader want to continue reading.Oh well, read it for the story, but don't expect great writing along the way."
4,Very Captivating,"I was a little hesitant to begin the book but quickly found that once I began it, it was hard to put down. However, there are few slow chapters, but you will find yourself willing to get through the chapters as you anticipate the story will ""pick up"" again in the next chapter."
2,Overblown,"I agree that this material was enough for a magazine article, no more. I guess we're to see more of this over-inflated article-into-book stuff. Oh well. Winchester is a thick, witless writer who needs to take better care with his use of words."
1,Where's the story...?,"The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED. Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme. As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the ""superior"" Victorian English kind."
2,Not quite Novel,Winchester's tome covers well trodden ground in a meticulous fashion. Its appeal to both American and English bookbuyers is granted but unfortunately it does not deliver on its strongly implied promises of mystery and intrigue. As a concisely constructed recounting and correction of facts about Dr Minor's contribution to the Oxford Dictionary it is very interesting but could have taken but a few pages in a magazine such as 'Vanity Fair' (not quite a novel's worth of reading !).The author's liking of repetition in his prose is also offputting rather than tension building. Bill Bryson's tome on the history of the English language covers much broader fields more lucidly and without the pretence for those interested in the history of our language.
1,Overrated and boring,"Another talentless writer lands on the bestseller list due to good publicity. The subtitle on this book is completely misleading---murder had nothing to do with the OED. Winchester describes the history of the dictionary ad nauseum. What could've been an interesting ten-page article is padded into a deadly boring 250-page book, with little interaction between the title characters. And, there's a particularly gruesome scene near the end. Don't waste your time or your money!"
1,Really boring book,"I really don't have much to offer beyond what others have written criticizing the book. I just felt the book needed another one star rating.I thought the topic of this book would be interesting. Maybe in someone else's hands the book would be, or maybe the topic just needed to be a magazine article as others have pondered. This book is really boring. I cannot even remember much about it other having what seemed like stray facts thrown at me. I mainly read history/non-fiction books, and this book ranks near the bottom of all the books that I have read in the past decade.Note: I listened to the book from an audible.com purchase. The narrator was fine. The material was just presented in a really boring manner."
4,"Murder, Insanity, and Logophilia","Part mystery, part suspense, part gripping history lesson, this was a revealing and surprising look at how the OED was made. It was a long labor of love and groundbreaking in it's organization. And how revealing that one of its chief contributors was criminally insane. But that's only half the story, the other half is about the perhaps equally as inexplicable drive of the ""professor"" in bringing about this astounding accomplishment. This is a great book for history buffs."
3,Fascinating book lacking focus.,"I was glad I read this book, because I learned so much about a truly incredible publication that I think most of us take for granted. However, I couldn't tell whether the author was more interested in the story of the making of the dictionary, or the sad life of Dr. Minor. In addition, Simon Winchester throws in obscure words, uses sanctimonious language and phrases that make it appear that he wishes HE wrote the dictionary. This is very British and somewhat nauseating. However, I would recommend this book highly for it's historical value."
4,Sad and Riveting,"This reads like great historical fiction. I now appreciate the work involved in writing dictionaries. Have often wondered how they get made. I think you will fall in love with the characters of this book, especially Dr. Minor. Winchester writes beautifully, with incredible creativity. What a treasure this is!"
4,Fantastic read for armchair etymologists,"This book is an absolute must for anyone with an interest in language.Winchester's telling of the saga behind the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary is at once dramatically engaging and philologically illuminating. The story will open for you exciting vistas in the scholarly world before and after the OED...fascinating stuff.Winchester's style is eminently readable, and his affection for words is abundantly clear. Any wanna-be linguists would do well to read it.Its only shortcomings are (in my opinion) an overly-extended examination of the history of schizophrenia at the end of the story and an epilogue which dragged somewhat.All in all, however, a TERRIFIC read which would be worth anyone's time."
2,Disappointing and not well written,"Like other readers, I had expected to be capitvated by this thrilling story, but instead found myself annoyed and irritated by the many grammatical infelicities and asides. Don't publishers edit work anymore?"
4,A skillful mixture of sensationalism & scholarly review.,"The story of one of the major contributors to the OED.Written fairly well, even if the author sometimes stoops to a rag-magazine sensationalist style.(Although one can't be too hard on a writer who wants their book to actually SELL these days!)FYI: It was reviewed in a fascinating article in the August or September issue of the Smithsonian magazine.Check that out!"
3,A yarn that misses the essential of healing relationships..,Mr. Winchester must have relied on academic opinions that emphasize the nature rather than nurture characteristics of Paranoid Schizophrenia. The humane individualized effort of Drs.Orange and Nicholson to encourage and promote Dr. Minor's costly but health-enhancing bibliophilic and painting interests illustrate how nurturing influences do modify and improve the natural course of this terrible illness. Dr.Brayn's cold-veined determination to de-individualize and dehumanize Dr. Minor's life at Broadmoor was probably associated with the decline in scholarly productivity and the eventual self-mutilation. This is regularly observed in incarcerated populations. The relational aspects of healing often have far greater influence than the hereditary contributions that academic consultants ...inexperienced with chronic treatment... like to emphasize.
3,Who would ever have thought that this would be interesting?,"How is a dictionary made? Boring topic, right? A resounding WRONG--Mr. Winchester spins the tale and examines the narrow ledge between sanity and madness at the same time. Several other amateur reviewers here dislike the author's style but I had no problems with his writing and certainly his research was well done. A great topic, quick and easily read."
4,A Delightful Read,"I originally purchased this as something to read 'just for fun.' I am pleased to say that Simon Winchester's book fulfilled its purpose perfectly while also providing compelling insights into the creation of the OED and the story of its creators. Not expecting to find an academic treatise on the topic which I fear too many readers did anticipate, Winchester's journalistic writing style has served to tantalize those readers who would explore further the myriad topics offered by his book as well as provide a glimpse into a very interesting story heretofore not always available to the general public."
4,Great format for an interesting tale,"The greatest part about this book is not the story it tells (although it is a great story) but how the story is told. It reads as both a sort of novel and a work of academic history. I would say it is a historical narrative but it is more than that combining both forms in seperate sections of the story and then blending them all together.Another nice touch is the author's use of a quote from the Oxford English Dictionary at the beginning of each chapter. Don't be decieved by the short length of the book, you will need a dictionary to learn all of these words and it has some great ones(some weren't even in my dictionary) But hey if you are going to read a book about lexiography you should use a dictionary right."
2,"weak writing, fascinating characters","I wanted to like this book more than I did. It had great promise, witih undelivered results. The repetitious writing gets in the way of the character's story. With a fascinating teaser intro, I was expecting more than I read. Apparently the author didn't read what he had written in the preceding chapter, or wrote out of order, because each chapter repeats itself, maybe to pad it into book length."
4,Fascinating Reading,"This book presents a fascinating historical account about the making of the OED. Although the book is a bit repetitive in places, the author manages overall to maintain a decent pace to captivate the reader. Simon Winchester himself is the master of English language as he weaves this entrancing tale. My book group thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,Can't wait to hear it live!,"As a fan of Jump(J,LC) for years, of course I am extremely excited to hear anything new from this great band. Their latest effort definitely combines the pop sensabilties from Magazine with the artsie elegance of Vertigo. I agree with an earlier reviewer who questioned the double-tracking of Jay's voice which is completely not necessary, but I also want to note that his diction and ennunciation have never been better. The guys roll into Atlanta on Saturday the 24th at the Variety Playhouse and I would highly reccomend this show to anyone who gets tired of bands sounding better on the radio than they do live, because Jump is an exception to that rule---you won't hear a better live band. Hope you will come out and hear them."
4,Not quite what I expected...,"First, JLC has been a favorite band of mine for five years - I've even adorned my car's rear windshield with a laughing-child sticker. This album resembles ""Vertigo"" much more than ""Magazine,"" which was surprising. I expected a few more uptempo, fun, catchy songs. Though the album is well-(if not over-)produced, it lacks the diversity of ""Magazine"" and even of ""Vertigo,"" and is very *safe*. I do recommend this album, but the sticker on the album packaging claiming it has the ""pop sense of 'Magazine'"" was a bit misleading."
2,Disappointing,"It's surprising and disheartening to find that a band capable of producing a song as perfect as ""Hold You Down"" can proceed to produce an album with no other redeeming qualities. The first track is decent as well, but I found the rest to be way too soft for anyone claiming to have testicles."
2,"Huge disappointment after Vertigo, Eloquence Lost","Usually when a band changes its name it is a meaningless act of marketing. Sadly, that is not true here. The reference to greater art gone, leaving only the mindless verb: Jump, serves as the perfect metaphore for a truly talented and literate band gone trite. To now write such bland, conventional songs and arrange them in such a candy assed way, resorting to lightly swirling electric guitars and breathy vocals articulating vacuous lyrics is for the members to completely fail to understand their great debt to introspection, intellectual reverence, and a classically fueled quirkiness. Not one song on this cd has any spiritual or intellectual rigor or genuine vigor. These lyrics say nothing in a common and trite way. The arrangements are unimaginative although performed flawlessly. The fault is not in their inability to fret notes, but rather, to fret notes uniquely. They have lost their voice."
3,bit of a let down...,"I was a bit disappointed with Jump's newest offering... The swirling, effect laden guitars and double tracked vocals are a far cry from the good old days of ""Licorice Tea Demos"".The title track and ""Rains in Asia"" are both pretty good. The new single ""Young America"" is pretty weak, as is the rest of the album.Here's to hoping that ""Between the Dim and the Dark"" grows on me over time..."
3,"Wish it was their best, but it's not","What Works: ""Rains In Asia"", ""Mexico""Not bad, but forgettable: ""Between the Dim and the Dark"", ""Hold You Down"", ""Young America"", ""Broken"", ""Requiem"", ""Midnight"",""Daylight""Doesn't Work at All: ""Education"""
2,Disappointing,"Having read some reviews, I was expecting a lot better of the Grammaire Progressive. The explanations are not clear, the level is not ""advanced"""
1,Not the thing I wanted,"Maybe my French is not strong enough, but this is just the key to the book. So make sure you are getting what you ordered. I send it back, but never heard from seller again."
4,Track lisitng and desciption,Mix 98.5 music put this out in 1998 and recorded in studio.Tracks:1. Barenaked Ladies - Naked Guy2. Barenaked Ladies - It's All Been Done3. Matchbox 20 - Push4.

5,The complete manual,"This manual is a reference for those who want to understand everything about Valkyrie. Comprehensive and clear, it really helps me in the workshop."
5,Timeless sentiments are music to my ear.,"The collection of quotations found in this book would warm any music lover's soul. They vary from witty to touching, but whatever the emotion the quotes chosen convey it is found in simple elegant phrases that have stayed with me long past the reading. Many repertoires of music are covered, so the appeal is wide. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to express a simple musical sentiment and can never quite find the words to say it."
3,Mistitled,"I bought this book hoping to gain some insight into the social nature of education in order to back up some research that I am currently conducting on the Japanese education system. However, I was a bit disappointed that this book covers social and political issues in regards to the American education system. If you're interested in that kind of information, then this might be of use to you, but if you're looking for a book on the sociology of education, then this is not it. It should be retitled ""The Sociology of the American Education System"". Another complaint is that the writing style is not very academic--what you might expect from a high school AP course or perhaps a community college course. I really recommend trying another textbook if you want in depth analysis of the sociology of education."
2,Works flawlessly--when it works,"Maybe a little lacking on more sophisticated FTP features, and it acts a bit weird with Windows 98 machines, but my major complaint is that I had TWO of these fail on me within the last 4 years due to (best I can guess) bad power circuitry. I leave them on 99% of the time and just turn them off occasionally for a day or a week while I am away. On two separate occasions when I came back I could not get the units to power up again. No lights, no hard drive power. No nothing. Completely dead. Guess you can never turn them off."
3,disappointed in the visual quality of the video,"I was very disappointed in the video quality, seemed like a cheap bootleg copy of a video. I have seen regular releases of these videos. Will seriously think about not buying from this vendor."
1,No,"5 of the finest ? Huh ? Then explain why the set DOESN'T have 5 of the finest entries in the Ernest library. Where's Saves Christmas, Goes To Camp, Scared Stupid, or even Goes To Jail ? I am aware that not all movies are owned by the same company. But doesn't Mill Creek have the rights to Camp, Jail, and Scared Stupid ? This may be worth it for the unreleased movies, but they really shouldn't have lied in the description."
3,The BEST Of Ernest? Really?,"Being an Ernest fan I would jump at the opertunity to own such a big set of his hilarious hick highjinks (try to say THAT three times fast). However, this set does not contain Ernest's best movies but rather some of his worst, and probably cheapest to make, movies. The only movies that I would get this for are Ernest Rides Again and Ernest Goes To School, the latter being the only good movie here. The above statement about the set mentions other material including the commercials that started Ernest's career in the first place, but it doesn't say which programs are on this set or to what extent. Bottom line: this is the first nice looking, and really big, Ernest set to hit store shelves, as well as marking the release of Goes To School on DVD for the first time, also amazon is selling it for a pretty decent price, but don't buy it until we learn more."
4,Case is unusual,My kids are thrilled with these shows of course. My only concern has been that the case itself doesn't seem to hold them very well. It's cardboard rather than plastic. I need to just transfer the discs to a different holder to make them more secure. But for the money you sure can't beat it. So many videos and such. The kids choose this rather often to watch.
3,class assignment,"This is a new version of the story we all know. It tells about how Jack got the magic beans. When Jack comes home with the ""magic"" beans, his mother is disappionted. She ends up throwing them out the window. Jack awakes the next day to find the beanstalk. What happens next? Read this outstanding book to find out.I found this book to be very good. From that boring old tale we all know, it turned into interesting rhymes. The full color illustrations add to this thrilling tale. If you and your child are looking for an adventurous story, this is it!"
1,Be Aware!,"Be aware that this picture DOES NOT match the product received. While it is the same style bed and color, it is not for a big dog as pictured. It does not have the middle support as pictured either.While I am very upset with this product, and picture, I am upset at myself for not reading the dimensions. I ASUMED it was for a big dog, because it is pictured, and there are NO CHOICES for you to choose a size.When they lost my first order, I should've taken it as a sign not to re-order. My 2 day shipping became an 8 day wait for something that was just not worth it. I will be returning it soon."
2,overpriced and collapses,Overpriced for what you get. My little 10 pound dog won't sit on it anymore because the feet don't lock open and the thing collapses when she goes to sit on it or moves around on it. If the box wasn't thrown out by mistake I would have returned it. Only thing good about it is it folds. It's a pain to set it down on the ground while making sure all the legs are fully opened up.
2,Disappointed in toy,"Although my son loves the Mystery Machine, it is made of CHEAP, CHEAP, plastic. Shaggy's arms keep falling off, the scooter is already broken, and the ghose cage is always coming apart. If I had known it was going to be like this, I would have never ordered the van."
5,Rit's Ronderful!,"This is one of the staple toys in the toybox - it always gets pulled back out and played with again and again. My boys love Scooby Doo - they didn't play much with the ghosts, but they carted Shaggy and Scooby around everywhere, and the Mystery Machine has been used and abused. It's been surprisingly durable - I really thought the back of the van, which opens up, would have the doors broken off by now, but it's still going strong. The gate on the ghost cage did break off and was lost, but it was no great loss. Shaggy lost an arm, but it was easily reattached and has remained intact. I wish there were more Scooby toys."
4,Lots of fun for scooby fans,"My son (...) is a big scooby doo fan. He recieved this toy for Christmas and has had lots of fun with it. Unfortunately many things have broken on his van. Within the first week all of the items inside the back of the van were broken and lost. Next the small handle on the rear of the van broke. Finally the scooter broke and had to thrown away. Even though the durability is not great, it has not interfered with the enjoyment of the toy. I would buy it again, but could do without all the little extras which seem to have just broken anyways. In addition to enjoying the van, my son has also enjoyed the Shaggy and Scooby figures."
3,Good for a Scooby Doo Fan,"My 5 yr old is a big fan of Scooby Doo these days & wanted to use a gift card he had gotten for Christmas for this van. He even took it to school for sharing & was a big hit! He plays with it every day & Shaggy & Scooby are his best buddies. My only reason for not giving it a higher rating was the scooter it came with. It keeps falling apart. It looks like they made it to be taken apart but there is no way to keep all the things together as he plays with it. Not sure what to do, so he just doesn't usually use it when he plays. The only other suggestion is to have the rest of the gang as part of the set. He really likes the whole gang of ""meddling kids"" but uses his imagination for them anyway. Good buy & good fun!"
1,Toy is OK - Toys R Us is not OK,Never trust Toys R Us. I ordered this toy 2.5 weeks before Christmas with a pre-Christmas delivery date and did not recieve the Toy until December 29th. Nice gift from Santa. No wonder Toys R Us is going out of business.
1,Every fake plant reviewer on Amazon thinks this is GREAT!!!!,Maybe not every review on here is fake. But almost everybody that reviewed this album has reviewed NOTHING ELSE. That is a red flag.So what is the real scoop on Lazy Incorporated? Imagine what Supreme Beings of Leisure would sound like if they sucked. Bingo.
4,Spartan Beings of Leisure,"Lazy seems to be Supreme Beings of Leisure in lean mode, for the most part. Although most of this album isn't as lush, moody and complex as a lot of the earlier SBL stuff, it's still a very pleasant listen. Some of the beats are... ahem... on the lazy side... and a couple are actually grating. But hey, I could probably listen to Jailyn (lead singer of both bands) sing the phone book. That voice needs very little adornment, and it is hard to detract from. Of the first 4 tracks, only ""Love Robbery"" is a dud, in my opinion. The others are somewhere on the scale between ""really dang good"" and ""classic"". I've listened to ""Runaway"" twice in the last few minutes, and won't mind if it plays again before I'm done writing. I'm glad to have many of these tracks to add to the SBL tracks I've enjoyed for so many years."
4,not the item pictured,"great beginner board, although the one i recieved is not the red ""retro "" style as shown.(which is also the one i wanted when i ordered). The board i recieved was a blue standard shape tri-fin. so check on this if you are set on a specific style. Still a great deal for an entry level board."
1,False Alarm,"Alarm went off, no CO detected. Put detector ouside on a breezy day, alarm went off. Obviously after 3 years, these detectors go bad. This is not an accurate or reliable product"
2,FireX fails after a few years,"We had a FireX COQ-8 CO detector installed in our new home in 2004. It went off a couple months ago (2010) but there is no CO in the house, though it scared us a little and Public Service told us we probably needed to get out for our safety. FireX had lasted 6 years. That's it. Stink."
1,Total junk - Randomly goes off in the middle of the night,"Pretty much the same as everyone else. The first time it went off we called the fire dept, they found no Carbon Monoxide.Since then, when it goes off, half the time it won't stop when you take it outside. Then if it does, you take it right back inside to where it was, without airing out at all, and it doesn't go off again. Recently it has gotten bad enough that it only lasts about a week before going off again. Got to be such a pain that I've had it disconnected for a month.Looking for a replacement now..."
1,Unreliable.,"I agree with the other reviews. I have 4 of these in my house. They were installed about 2-2.5 years ago. Three of them have gone off for no apparent reason, one of them in the middle of the night. There has been no carbon monoxide in the house at all. Look for other brands."
5,Anne Taintor Products Rock,"I love all of her products. The captions depict a side of women that they usually keep to themselves or share only with a very close girlfriend. So often, they show what many women think but would never, for propriety's sake, let see the light of day. The times when I forget to laugh about how mundane domestic life can be, I leaf through her planner, journal, calendar, etc. and find my sense of humor, once again."
4,One of the best,"One of the best informative surveys out there. He does his best writing on issues of understanding Genesis as a polemic against pagan religions and the subsequent chapters. This first of the book is historical and some of the writing is not as smooth...but still good ( reason for the 4 star).But read this book with ""bic pen"" in hand b/c the has good things underline through-out!"
5,To read aloud,"My highest recommendation on this book is due to the fact that my five-year-old grandson loves the book and asks me to read it over and over to him. The illustrations are very nice and colorful, the book is done with wit and humor and is a fun read."
4,good for indepent children,My boys love this book so I bought it for the leappad so they can read it anytime they want to. Especially until they can read!!! You can only read a book so many times . . . LOL
1,DO NOT BUY THIS if you are a Hank Marvin fan,This are NOT the Shadows we know...an imposter group using their name only.I had been a Shadows (and Cliff) fan forover 35 years.These are not Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch andBrian Bennett.
2,Just So-So,"This is my first book by Tori Phillips. It was a sweet story, but everything seemed to work out just a little TOO perfectly. I never really felt any excitement or curiosity over the story. I suppose that is just because I kind of knew what would happen all along. I probably will not be reading any of the other books in the series."
3,Silly fluff...but a warm and fuzzy read,"This book was the kind of silly fluff that I would let my young daughter read without a second thought. There are NO real sexual feelings or contact between the characters and the historical corectness of the setting is dubious at best. The harsh realities of child brides, medieval food and real life in general would mare this simple, light story. Despite its faults the story is warm and would be appropriate for most any age reader. I read ""Silent Knight"" in a day and felt quite upbeat afterwards, unlike some of the more historical romances I get involved in. I would not recomend this work for a real life look at England in the Middle Ages, but it is a good start for young or jaded readers."
1,Watch it on HBO or rent it,A Rose McGowen movie with a happy ending and no one dies. You do the math. A cutsie movie with much more potential than it exhibits.
1,Road to Bad Movies,"The acting was pure, unadulterated plastic.The sets were cheesy.The story matched the sets and the acting.One star is one too many.It's good for laughs if you need a B movie fix."
5,excellent book,This is an excellent book with many nice photos and lots of great information from Rachel. I bought the book many years ago but lost it. I hope they reprint it soon.
4,"Language could have been simplified, the ""academese"" was thick","I think this is an great piece of work, and should be taken by someone and rewritten to be used to teach primary school kids how to communicate effectively. In fact, Douglas Walton does a great job of explaining these concepts in his book ""Fundamentals of Critical Argumentation"", which I recommend over this one. These concepts are being adapted by computer programmers to develop algorithms for computers to imitate dialog. The authors took concepts that I consider to be common sense, documented them and created an ""ideal"" procedure for carrying out discussions. This book is important because I think it has the potential to improve the quality of life for everyone because it teaches a procedure for communication that if learned early and used could dramatically reduce misunderstandings and effectively expose fallacies in reasoning. BRAVO!beware though, it is DRY."
5,Wow! Ballet used to contact aliens in space!,"Well, it's another unusual concept by Spider Robinson and his wife, Jeanne. This caught my eye after I read some of the Callahans stuff and it looked like an interesting read(The Hugo and Nebula awards had NOTHING to do with it. No, really).Typical Robinson to take a concept SO off-the-wall and make it work!"
5,Sci-Fi for Dancers!,"I'm a former ballet dancer who likes science fiction. This book was recommended to me by a friend who was familiar with all the Robinson books and I'm really glad.The portrayal of dancers whose bodies can't handle the punishing gravity of this earth any more was quite realistic. I love that there was both a female and male dancer involved in the plot, and I wish I could have seen some of those star dances! What a lovely idea!The sci-fi plot line was also intriguing. I kinda like the idea of luminous stardancer beings floating around out there in the stars.This is a very different genre than ""Lady Slings the Booze"", but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also enjoyed Starseed, the sequel, and am about to start Starmind."
5,They are what they are,"Pretty good nylon belt keepers. I use them on my SWAT gear and they hold up well. The buttons lose there black finish if they get rubbed by a piece of gear too long, but I could really care less about that. They are secure and work well."
4,works fine so far,"normally I carry FIREARM CONCELED BUT HAD TO START CARRYING OPENLY FOR OUR DEPT THESE WORKED FINE SO FAR BUT TIME WILL TELL ,ITS BEEN A FEW WEEKS."
5,Lupin the III,"Lupin the III is a wonderful book, full of ingenuity and mischief, this book is a must have for your book case. These succesful books are now animes shown on Cartoon Network at midnight on weekdays. These books show us the adventures of a the world's gretest thief, Lupin, and his comrades, Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko."
4,Why shoud a Christian be a Darwinist?,"Christians shouldn't compromise their faith with the ""wisdom"" of this world. Christians who compromised their faith with platonism, neo-platonism, aristotelism, kantianism, marxism, freudianism and darwinism, all realized that they made a big mistake. With its ""toothless fossil record"", its just-so stories about the origins of the universe, its wild probabilities when dealing with DNA and RNA, its wishful thinking about the pre-biotic soup, its blind faith in the power or mutations and natural selection, with its explaining away irreducible complexity and complex specified information, its tautological arguments about common descent, embriologic similaries, etc. etc., Darwinism shouldn't waste the time of any believer in the devine Logos made flesh. This Logos is the absolute foundation who makes science possible, intelligible and certain. Thinking God's thoughts after God himself (Newton, Kepler) should be the research program of wise scientists."
2,"Well-intentioned, but...","I appreciate Ruse's attempts to find common ground between religion and science, and I agree with him that evolution (of a type) more than likely is God's creating mechanism.I don't think Darwin gave a very good description of how evolution works (the evidence is plainly piling up against the idea that random mutation and natural selection are the main drivers of evolution), and I give this book a poor rating for blithely assuming that Darwin's highly theoretical (and no crumbling) theory is fact."
4,NYC's best singer/pianist!,"Anything Daryl Sherman does is delightful! Like a modern-day Mildred Bailey, Daryl is a classic song's best friend."
2,Know what you're getting,"Anyone considering buying any of the CDs in this series (I have 13 of them) should be forewarned that they consist mostly of remakes. They do include some originals -- the one shown here contains four -- but otherwise, as stated on the liners, ""All other selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original lead singer with one or more members of the original group."" The concept is not entirely without interest, and I do enjoy some of the remakes where I am unfamiliar with the originals, but if you are expecting a definitive collection of oldies you might be disappointed."
2,Landmann big sky fire pit,"The shipment came with slight dent to the fire pit. Poorly packed product. I'm willing to accept a slight dent on the side, BUT The fire pit ring did not fit. This product is either poorly design or there must be a defect. I can't imagine a product with a nice fire pit would come with cruddy ring assembly!. I plan to request a new set of ring be mailed to me. I hope the seller will honor this since I would hate to return the whole thing back. If not, I will return it."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,This is exactly what we were looking for. Looks nice and has a very deep fire bowl. Love that it has a cooking grill that comes with it.
4,As promised,"The fire pit arrived as promised. Assembly was straight forward and the quality of the workmanship was very good. The planet and star cut outs give a really nice effect and the spark screen does a good job of preventing most sparks from flying off. Our family enjoys using the fire pit more often than I thought and since it's relatively light, we are able to store it out of the weather. It's a good value for the money."
4,Kept me warm,"The pit was easy enough to set up with a screwdriver. I used it only once so far and enjoyed it. Seems sturdy when I am moving it around, even with a bunch of sand at the bottom (as the product recommends). It lives in my shed when not in use.My buddy stepped on the top screen cover and put a nice foot print in the metal. But he pushed out the damage and I can not even tell it was stepped on!"
5,Fire in the hole!,"After researching various fire pits, both on line and in stores, I decided on the Landmann 28335 Big Sky Stars & Moons Fire Pit. I am very pleased with my purchase! I live in California so I'm just waiting for it to cool off to try it out. I have it all set to go, though, and only need to purchase the makings for smores. I put it together myself without any difficulty (and I'm a woman). It is a great value for the price!Landmann 28335 Big Sky Stars & Moons Fire Pit, Georgia Clay, 12.5-inches deep"
2,Chinese Steel ROTS OUT,Lots of fun at the fire for seven months. Then the bottom rots out so badly that you can't even weld it. The legs rust off of it too. Typical Chinese import disposable product. Save your money and buy something domestic -- or bring it indoors after taking the ashes out each time you use it.
4,"Landmann Big Sky Stars & Moons Fire Pit, Georgia Clay, 12.5-inches deep (Lawn & Patio)","Nice and sturdy fire pit. Can hold a lot of wood ... have used it once. Bought and received 4 days ago from Amazon for $128, it's selling $98 today 06/08/10 but Amazon refused to match the price, very disappointed since we're a loyal customer and have spent several thousands with them. Will not buy again."
1,paint peeled the first time we used it,I know this thing is pretty cheap but come in...it peeled the first time we fired it up. it is pretty at night when the fire is twinkling through the stars and moons..
4,Smoking,I debated between getting an open pit or a chimenea. I thought the open pit would give off more heat since the chiminea only has a small opening in the front. I think this model does a good job of giving off heat because of the cutouts on the side. But it does smoke a lot. I'm looking for a different type of wood to help offset this. We also added a grate for the bottom of the pit so the logs don't just lay on the bottom. We thought this also might help it last longer by not having the bottom burn out. I only wish this was made in the USA instead of China.
4,Nice fire pit.,"We got this for our back patio. It was packaged very well. You have to put the legs and ring around the top on. As others have said the ring had to be manhandled to get it to fit right. I was afraid the whole thing would be kind of flimsy but, it actually pretty well maid. We used it a few times now and fires burn well and complete. We did place a small amount of sand in the bottom as directed in the instructions.The concrete under the pit got a warm but, not too hot. The poker it comes with is in two pieces and screws together. It's nice and long. It works great for putting the spark shield on and off.The first time we used the pit it looked like the paint/coating on the inside was burning. The inside is now black but the outside is still the reddish orange color.We are happy with the purchase."
4,Good fireplace,Fireplace works well. Only problem is that the screws on the rail do not match up exactly. Must bend into place. Also the cover may also need to be bent into place to fit nicely into the round firepit space. Smores are great with this thing and the design is pretty when lit up.
5,Back yard fun!,"This is a great fire pit for the money. It is deep and secure. No fear of the fire getting ""loose."" It also doubles as a BBQ. Great buy for the money."
5,Great Gift!,"My husband wanted a fire pit for Christmas, mainly to burn branches and twigs, etc in it. I shopped local stores, and the fire pits in the stores were so shallow, and didn't seem deep enough to hold much. Also, knowing my husband was going to burn branches, I wanted something durable and heavy. I waited until the last minute to buy this for him for Christmas, and I'm glad I did. He couldn't wait to open it, and uses it every chance he gets. We have gone so far as to use the grill grate to cook steaks on the pit, with some cherry woodchips, and I must say, best steak ever. It gives your food good smoke! The kids love going out to roast marshmallows over the pit while it's burning, and so far, it's held up great to near daily use since Christmas. We just love it!"
4,NIce backyard firepit,"Nice firepit, deeper than most you find in local stores so you can stack a decent amount of firewood. Workmanship could be a little better on the paint and having to punch out the holes (from the machining debris) for the ring. But overall it's a great firepit for someone who wants a medium sized and portable."
2,2 stars at best,"Not sure what unit the other reviewers recieved but mine is a 2 star at best item. Made in China and looks it, very thin metal would guess 18g maybe even 20g will be taking steel gauge home tonight to check for sure. Now for the good it is fairly priced at $100 - $125 just wasn't the great deal I thought I was getting but just like the cheap fire pits you will see at the big box stores. Bought it to have roast marshmellow with 4 yr. old son and will get the job done just not sure if it will be around when he is 6!"
5,firepit,"This fire pit does what is expected. If a layer of sand is used as suggested, it will not burn out. On our first camping trip we had a large fire in it for 14 continuous days with no obvious damage. Also it can be moved when desired."
5,nice fire pit,This fire pit is made very well and like that the fire pit comes with a grill grate so if you decide you want to cook up some burgers and dogs you can.
5,AN ALL ROUNDER,"I simply love this book, it explains most topics in detail. I believe anyone who wants to be a somebody in VB programming should have this book. I just relocated from London and it was definitely in my suitcase!!! It covers programming for the beginner, Database and web Programming for the intermediate to advance users, it is simply a must have."
2,Way too sketchy,"While this book does cover a lot of topics, it is simply too sketchy and poorly written to be of much use. I have not read it cover to cover, but I have used about half the chapters while trying to learn various aspects of VB. As an example, I used the chapter on creating a help system and found it to be very frustrating. The examples given were very poor and way too sketchy. Some of the figures were wrong and the examples were poorly connected. I figured out the basics of writing a help system using this chapter, but it was a very frustrating experience."
2,Book with almost nothing about almost everything,"I am lucky guy because I used e-version and don't need to return it back.Reading few chapters is enough to make this estimate.Really it's enough only to open a chapter about ""Client/server"" to find that 'Accessing data stored in a SQL Server database from within Visual Basic can be done in a number of ways: Directly, using data access objects (DAO) Using a Data control (and associated bound controls)(...) Using DAO or bound controls (...)"" That' s all folks! No mention about RDO, ODBC, SQL-DMO and other stuff ! If this book is platinum,I'm simply the best!"
5,"A must have for your library, timeless and ageless","My children and I learned of this book through the scholastic dvd collection. The book was animated but the best was hearing Chief Jake Swamp read the story in English and in his native Mohawk. I can't tell you what mesmerized the children more - the beautiful paintings, the message or the music we were hearing along with the words. My sons asked for the book after watching it over and over. It is not just for Thanksgiving, but as Chief Jake Swamp says, it is how his people are taught to greet the day. What a great way to begin teaching children to be grateful for what we have from the earth."
3,"good, but not great","The Winslow series featuring Neal Carey, has a certain charisma. Always well written and entertaining. The characters in this one are a little too stereotyped and the goings on a little too predictable. But, as always, a fun and quick read. Check out the whole series for a good time without too much to think about. ""Cool Breeze On the Underground"" still the best of them."
3,Tedious and deathly slow,"Having never seen The Jewel in the Crown, I cannot compare this production to that one. I will say that we watch a lot and buy a lot of British dramas in our house. I bought this one, watched, it and sold it on Amazon Marketplace. It was not a keeper for us. It was barely watchable, and about as life-affirming as malaria.Other reviewers have commented on the acting of the leads. I would agree, but that only begs the question of what they could have done with a better script. This one was simultaneously slow and superficial. How'd they pull that off?"
4,Mr. Kimble does it again!,"Having just finished reading ""Mrs. Kimble,"" I'm struck once again, by how women are taken in over and over again by the wrong men. I liked the book a lot, though of all of Haigh's books, I liked ""The Condition"" the best. I recommend both of them."
3,Relatively good book about a jerk:,"This is a book I received as a gift and was excited to read it right away. It wasn't something I asked for, but I was intrigued by the cover.This book tells a story about a jerk who marries three different women and has affairs in the meantime. It also takes you through the life of his abandoned children and the ones he doesn't bother to parent.The story is told through the eyes of the women he marries and the family members around him. It's well-told and leaves you with the feeling that regardless of where you come from or what your background is, you can still be bamboozled by a jerk and brainwashed into a lifestyle you didn't truly ask for and a husband thought you wanted- but didn't.I was just left with one thought: ""What an f-ing jerk."""
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I read this book nearly in one evening because I couldn't put it down!!! I thought this book was excellent. The editor's review states that there are holes in this book and that we never understand how Kimble became a jerk, how smart Joan could fall for him, or why Dinah stays with him. This is the stuff of life. We don't often understand the people around us and this makes the book, the story, and the people in it all the more real and poignant.Thanks Jennifer Haigh for an awesome book. Keep them coming!"
2,Mrs. Kimble,"Yes this book was well written, but I really don't enjoy reading about down-trodden women. I found this book very depressing."
3,A reader from Olympia,"Mrs. Kimble is a compelling readable novel about a chameleon of a man who seduces and marries three very different women. Although this was an enjoyable read, I felt the characters lacked depth. Ken Kimble's motivation for being so smarmy is never explained or understood. More troubling than that was how easily he seemed to charm these women. I found his second wife's sudden conversion from investigative reporter to smitten wife who only scratched the surface of her husbands dearth of history especially unbelievable. Surely breast cancer isn't an excuse for loosing all insight. Still a very pleasant read that will make beer bellied honest husbands everywhere look good."
5,Highly recommend this one,"I became aware of this book while reading the reviews of the author's latest book ""Baker Towers."" This one looked intriguing so I thought I would give it a try. I was taken with it after the first 40 pages. I felt a connection with each of the wives. In the beginning, you wonder why these women fell for this man. But as you read it starts to make sense. These are three damaged women who needed the kind of attention this man was willing to provide to them...at first. I liked the way the author wove the story of Charlie into the book as well. This is a beautifully written book that I never lost interest in. I hope ""Baker Towers"" is as good."
4,"Original, subtle, and interesting debut novel","The story of three women who marry an elusive con man. Ken Kimble is a human amoeba capable of morphing into whatever shape pleases the woman he wants. The novelist's focus is on the three very different women who are his victims, and each portrayal is subtle and all too real. The skill with which the women are drawn is amazing in so young a writer, as is her perceptive and never sentimental picture of Kimble's three children. The dialogue is as real as life. One could only wish for a bit more depth in the description of the women's background and character. As for Kimble, such a person could never be made understandable--revinvention of himself to suit the moment is his very nature.A highly original work from a writer who promises much."
4,"Interesting premise, weak follow-through","During Ken Kimble's adult life, he marries three women, two of whom will bear him children. The story is told through the eyes of each woman and one of his three children.Ken is a rotter but we never gain a good understanding of why these women, who seem intelligent and are, in two cases, independently accomplished, marry him. Nor do we ever get a good handle on what makes him tick, unless being rich is to be a satisfactory answer.The book is highly plot-driven and well-written, and an enjoyable read. I didn't notice how empty it was until I finished - rather like eating pasta instead of meat."
3,Mixed feelings about this one,"The man, Ken Kimble, was a people user, without feelings of how he affected those he used. Three women, all different, who got sucked into his web of charm. Birdie, innocent first wife with kids, Joan, a brief second wife and Dinah, the final wife, were the three unlucky women. Three kids were left in Kimble's wake but Charlie is the one centered on. The characters were very unique and I was impressed with that, but they lacked depth. We get the surface of the characters and not too much else. It needed a better story to tie these characters together. An okay book but could have been better."
4,Mrs Kimble,Interesting perspective on needy women and their relationship with a self absorbed man. I found the ending somewhat disappointing.
3,JUST SO SO...,The story was too predictable. Reading the synopsis pretty much told the whole story. Not enough twists or turns; character development was lacking.
4,Excellent read,"This is an engrossing first novel by a very promising author. The plot and character development are well done. It was difficult to put down this book once I'd begun reading it. I had hoped to learn more about the reasons behind Ken Kimble's behavior, but this was the only flaw in an otherwise consuming novel. I hope that future books by Jennifer Haigh are as well done as this one."
2,"Great beginning, stupid ending","I kept looking for the redeeming portion of this book. I won't give anything away, but the ending was ridiculous. You get through an entire book and that's the ending? I was intrigued by the back cover which stated that we would ""get a glimpse inside the mind of Ken Kimble"". We never did! Aside from his second wife, Joan, who you can see fell in love with him because of her loneliness and her disease, was a good character, but the other wives were ridiculous. I bought this book for a penny from a used book seller on Amazon. So glad I didn't spend more money. A penny is about what it's worth."
2,Slow,"The benefit to this book is that you can read it before falling asleep at night and not worry that you've missed something. The downfall is it's too slow, there's no real development of the story - I felt as if facts were just being laid out, one after the other.On the other hand, I think this author has a great way with words and is very descriptive."
1,Forgettable,"I'm sorry, I found this book a total bore. None of the characters were particularly remarkable or interesting--although, my heart went out to little Charlie. I couldn't figure out why Mr. Kimble married the first wife. Not much in it for him with that one except youth. And what was he doing while he spend so many hours away from home? Was he truly engrossed in his business or was he with other women? There are just too many people like him and too many dumb women in real life to make this book interesting. Nothing unique about it. If I hadn't been stuck in the middle of nowhere with nothing else to read I wouldn't have read it. It makes the good books out there seem so much better."
4,third in a series,"I am becoming more bequiled with this author, I tend to read groups of books from authors, and this is currently my favorite.She has a way of making you feel that you are right there walking with her character,and I couldnt put the book down until I finished most of them, ending up staying up all nite."
3,Mrs. Kimble,"Excellent writing. I was dismayed however by Ms. Haigh's conclusions that the 3 women were not victims. Miss Haigh did not allow the reader to develop much empathy for the female characters. They were victims because Ken Kimble chose broken women; he could never have gotten away with his callousness with an emotionally sound woman. The second woman felt inadequate because of her mastectomy. The first was sheltered, raised under a strict religious doctrine, and the last suffered with low self-esteem feeling that no one could love her. Still, Ms. Haigh's stories are intriguing."
2,Christian Book,"C.A.Harday, a reviewer below, got a little carried away in her negative review of this book, but I agree with her basic criticism. This is a Christian book with Bible citations throughout. I stopped reading when I realized the author's obvious bias. When I'm looking for information on immune system health, I'm not looking for highly-biased presentations on religion. My bias isn't against Christianity per se, it's including Christianity without fully disclosing that personal bias nor making a connection between that personal bias and the supposed educational material of the book. The author needs to be more open and honest, or she needs to leave her personal religion out of her desire to ""educate"" about health. She quickly burned her credibility with me.A better book is 4 Weeks to Maximum Immunity: Disease-Proof Your Body by the editors of Prevention Magazine (2008)"
2,For Christian Readers primarily,"I hadn't expected at all that this would be a Christian-oriented book. The author mentions God and praises God in a Christian way on almost every page. This can be off-putting to readers, such as myself, who are looking for medical information free of religious fervor. There are many things I wish the author had done instead of praising her God, such as provide more scientific/medical explanations for some of the things she suggests, e.g. purging/colon cleaning. This book had some helpful information in it but not much beyond what you probably already know if you've been halfway paying attention to news and talk shows for the last decade. It certainly wasn't what I'm looking for in my desire to repair my immune system following a serious illness."
2,In depth study of Tom Paine,"Tom Paine's Common Sense was one of the most influential writings of the American Revolution. Eric Foner covers this period of Paine's career in 30 pages. The rest of this tome is dedicated to the founding of new political systems in Pennsylvania and controversies surrounding the establishment of the Bank of North America. Although these topics are of interest to scholars, they were of limited interest to this more casual reader. I found much of the book tedious and difficult to wade through. It would probably be great for those with a thirst for rarely documented parts of early American history. Probably this would not be a good choice for those with a more casual interest in this period."
4,IT'S A KOOSH!!,"Not educational, but fun to throw around! Though it smells a little funky when you first get it, it's still awesome."
4,Defintely sweat!,"I really like the first workout. That's why i gave it 4 stars because i'm a huge kickbox fan and I love the 60 min kickbox segment but I could live without the second one, it's mainly a latin dance routine. It's easy to follow (moves are not that complicated) but i don't feel like i really worked anything. The kickbox segment has a lot of reps for each exercise but by the end of the 60 min you are defintely sweating! I've lived on Taebo and this I find is more challenging. I've only had it for like a month and i think i've done it 2x a week since i bought it! I really do like it."
5,Amazing quality,great sound quality. great accessory options and amazing user interface. overall the best mobile media unit i have ever owned/used.
4,ALPINE IVA W205,Raidio is great but too hard to get the sound I'm looking for I'm use to having an equalizer but I'm working on it. I have all top of the line JL Audio separates and subs and amps to go with the raidio so hopefully the sound will come around. My installer also said the serial numbers were scratched off the raidio and removed from the box so I might be srewed if something goes wrong with it
5,Fabulous Pheasant,I've prepared these pheasants several times and they always turn out well. This size is great for a dinner with about 4 people. Just make sure you don't over cook it because it's NOT CHICKEN. I made that mistake once and definitely learned from it.
2,"A bit pumpist, but the message is there.","I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of pages without a reference to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, this high profile firm and that high profile firm, etc. It becomes VERY annoying and unfortunately takes away from the message of the book.It is also severly out of date, but that is to be expected from a 1983 book.Before buying this book, I would seriously consider getting something more recent and less inclined to ""name-dropping"".The overall book is not that ground breaking and a lot of other books, I am sure, have the same information (i.e. ISBN 2760616789 it's in French though).Not the best reading..."
4,DPeter...,This is an excellent guide for the novice or expereinced consultant. It is also very useful to anyone functioning in an internal consulting capacity. The book is easy to read and is laid out in a very orderly manner.
2,needs editing,"Buyers of this book should beware that it is self-published, and needs editing. Aside from the spelling errors (""court marshal"" for ""court martial"") and meandering prose style, some of the arguments seem weak. For example, we're told that the number of villages in Greece declined after the fall of Mycenae, and that the population of Europe declined after the Black Death of the Middle Ages; therefore, the fall of Mycenae might have been accompanied by the plague. The author doesn't say whether this is a widely held opinion, or merely his own speculation; and without any biographical information about the author, it's hard to know what's reliable in the book, and what's not."
4,"Great companion piece to ""Islands in the Sea of Time"" series","I used this book as a reference-companion while reading S. M. Stirling's ""Islands in the Sea of Time"" alternate history trilogy. After I started reading the series, I found I did not know as much about the late bronze age as I thought I did. I don't suppose that should have been a big surprise, but it was. A friend loaned me his copy of ""Collapse of the Bronze Age""; it made all the difference. Granted, Stirling's fictional account (of modern-day Natucket, plus some Coast Guard ships, being snatched back to approx. 1200 BC) soon diverted from ""known"" history (by the actions of his characters), but I found I was still in need of a guide. Stirling uses many historical personages and locations in the novels, often referring to them by names only scholars would know and not those we all learned in high school. I'm sure Robbins' book stands well on its own. I just thought some of you might like to know one of its other uses."
5,Maxie,Great read - I couldn't put it down until I turned the last page. Maxie is a great character - I vote for a series!
5,hilarious -- great for the baseball fan,"let's face it, this is a great gift for guys who love baseball. it's got quotes from the older players that are part of history (like yogi berra, babe ruth, joe torre), stuff that makes you think about the game and quotes that will just make your hair stand up on end (i.e. john rocker)... I'm buying 2 copies as gifts for father's day."
4,"Very good, but not like the origional","This film is very good, almost exactly like cannibal holocaust, but it is not as classic as the origional in my opinion. The blood guts and nudity are all there though, and gore hounds wont be dissapointed. Its still a fun movie (if you think this kind of movie is fun) to watch with a bunch of friends, and for hardcore fans of Cannibal Holocaust this is a must see!"
3,good fit,"Overall, a nice anklet. One disappointment is the outside fabric balls up after washing. Good fit, secure and snug, doesn't ride down in shoe."
2,"Disappointing, no new info vs. website","When we looked for colleges for my oldest 3 yrs ago, the Princeton Review website was invaluable; so we bought their book, ""The Best Northeastern Colleges, 2010 edition"", expecting deeper insight vs. the website.I found that the info in the book appears to DUPLICATE the website, with no new substantive info added...easier to handle because of not needing to click, but each two page listing (per college) consists of lots of repeat info (ie, file the FAFSA as early as possible...--duh!) and no deeper content.Use the website, but do not bother with the book!"
2,Not worth the price,"Purchased this item with the impression that it was truely quality, couldn't be further from the truth."
5,Axe,"This is a well built axe ,the handle is mounted to the head well.I use it to trim limbs and brush , it's light weight so you can swing it for a while."
3,Its OK for the money,I bought this axe because I wanted to split wood. DO NOT GET THIS FOR SPLITTING WOOD. It sucks splitting. I don't know about chopping but it comes not very sharp. Oh and if you want this axe buy it from Menards and save on shipping. But if its splitting or chopping you want spend a couple extra buck and get a nice Fiskars Power splitting axe. It both chops and splits with ease. Plus its lifetime warranty so you never have to replace the handle. It has paid for itself many times over.
1,defective,"The right boot had a fold in the inner liner of the leather upper, digging in to a toe. There is also a defect of the finish on the leather right at the tip of the toe. I am returning the boots. Quality control should be better for such obvious flaws. Made in China."
4,Informative,"Excellent book- full of information and very readable, without being too tecnical or pedantic. I might fault the author for being a bit sparse on 19th C. American composers, but this is a matter of personal judgement and the need to keep the book within manageable length. Also in 1998 fewer works by composers such as Fry, Bristow, Lambert and John Knowles Paine were available for listening."
5,Best Eye Cream I Ever Used!,I have tried several expensive eye creams and always come back to this one. It reduces the fine lines under the eye - I have been using it for years and would definitely recommend it.
1,This Happens Too Often,"The customer reviews that precede this one have nothing to do with the product on this page; they're for a film made in the 1970's which is sold elsewhere on Amazon. THIS page is for a British television anthology series that was supposed to be a follow-up to the popular Hammer House of Horror. This one (which I'm trying to get hold of) never actually aired and was rather recently released in two sets for the home video market here and in the UK. I can't rate the series or the release since I've never seen it, but I can certainly assign a single star based on the obtuseness of a particular online purveyor of goods and its inability to get things straight EVEN AFTER THE ERROR IS CITED."
3,Why is Italian given as the primary text?,"The notes are clear and easy to read, but the font for the text is quite small, and to make matters worse, this edition (Dover Vocal Scores) gives Italian as the primary language (immediatly below the notes). The German text is in italics *under* the Italian. If you buy this edition, you're going to need an English copy of the libretto - all the text (lyrics, stage directions, and unsung diologue) are given in German and Italian."
2,Not as expected,The book is good but the information is too old and also informative. just talk about the aircraft but not the systems.I bought it as a back up information about the A340 systems . It seems to be more and historical book
4,An excellent evaluation of Gone With The Wind,"Richard Harwell is the foremost authority on ""Gone With The Wind"" and has gathered into one collection the most significant writings on the book, film, and author.The first section of the book records the reception of the book as a phenomenal world wide best seller. Part two describes how the novel's success and Pulitzer Prize changed the author's life. Part three examines the social and psychological aspects of the impact of the book. The fourth part discusses the making of the film."
1,Worthless,"This is a totally worthless book. The interviews with homeless people reveal no useful information, and are extremely boring. Nothing can be learned from this book. There is no actual reason to read this book."
5,Heartsongs a Must-Read!!,This set of books is an amazing & refreshing read.Mattie can smile down upon us knowing that he changesevery person's life who reads his books.
5,Heartfelt reading at it best,Mattie wrote poetry from his little heart. The hearts of adults can hear his heart-song as a symphony of classical music.
5,Now it's Number 2,"First off, let me say that I love this pen. It has been my favorite for years. But if you love this pen, you owe it to yourself to check out Zebra's newest offering, the F-701. All the same features except for an all steel barrel as oppossed to the F-402's partial plastic one. After years of faithful service my first F-402 cracked along the plastic under the comfortable rubber grip. Of course I immediately bought another one since I had yet to find another pen for the price and quality of that one. Then a friend of mine found the F-701. Being a 402 fan like myself he bought 2 and gave one to me. It is now my first choice for a writing instrument. I still keep my 402 as a back up but the F-701 is my favorite now."
5,"My favorite pen, too!","I am an insurance agent, and some of our forms are still paper forms with 5 'carbon' copies to get through while filling them out.These are the best pens around for everything (especially considering the price), but they shine even brighter when I have to fill out those forms. These are the ONLY pens I have found that can make even the 5th page readable without killing my hand in process.And because they have a slightly thicker barrel than some pens, they are much more comfortable to hold and use.I even think my handwriting is slightly better when I use this pen as opposed to others! :)"
5,Great CD!!!,I just wanted to add that this CD are GREAT and i order it on november 25th 2007 and received it today on january 15th 2008!...better late than never;o)**Kenny Rogers are a great singer!..(and will always be)**Cheerz from Bina;o)
1,BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!,This is the worst product I have purchased. I put it up for the first time and within hours the aluminium frame was in pieces. It is so flimsy! I expected more durability for a product meant to be for the outdoors! For the amount of money I paid it is a rip off. I could not even return it because all the parts were broken and the frame could not collapse or fold. What a mess.....Never buy this!!!!!
4,Fun with microphone,"I gave this book to my four year old son before a grueling 32-hour trip with four plane changes. He had a blast recording his own voice with the microphone. He had a wonderful time playing independently. It was so refreshing to see him laughing his heart out saying ""NO, Pat!"" and ""Don't sit on that!"""
3,Porno doco,"It is a doco of making porno at the dawn of the legalizing a business in Hollywood.Sometimes funny, sometimes rude, this work is just of doing cinematographic stuff as usual, leaving authors' porno for X-movies."
3,Good movie about the Mitchell Brothers,Charlie and Emilio bald and no I didnt misspell it. This is a good depiction of how they founded the modern day porn industry and then how drugs undid it all
2,Bad wigs,"This movie could have been handled so much better. Doesn't help that the brothers Sheen wore terrible bald wigs which were so noticeable in parts it made the film so silly. Just keep your eye out for the really shiney moments when the wigs look so plastic. That aside, what is wrong with this film. Besides the fact it did nothing at the box office, the film just doesn't have enough punch to pull you in. I really felt nothing for any of the characters involved, and you need to be able to do this to appreciate a film.The Sheen brothers team up again for this film (remember ""Men at Work""?). Someone must have told them that they make a good combination, but I am afraid that this partnership couldn't save this film."
5,Work perfect,"Brake pads look better than Originals, went in and fit perfectly, Truck stops again. All for 1/2 the price of Advance Auto Parts."
4,Sweet and uplifting,"I originally rented this just so see a glimpse of Jeremy Sisto, who I adore in all of his films, but i was surprised to find myself completely swept up by this soft, quiet story of a woman who lost her husband. So true to life, the way she grieves over him. Can't imagine losing my husband so suddenly and swiftly that you feel like all the air's been knocked out of your lungs. Elizabeth Perkins, Whoopi Goldberg and Gwynyth Paltrow all do well in their roles of family/friends who laugh and bicker and live life as best they can while helping each other along the way. Whoopi's marriage is crumbling and Gwynyth is afraid of falling in love, even with Jeremy, who is completely captivating in this movie and only gives me another reason to love it. A really good film to watch alone so you can get immersed in it and enjoy it."
2,"Jon is Great, this movie isn't...","Yes, in case you missed him, Jon Bon Jovi is in this movie... he has a very small part. When he is on the screen, he's good... the movie isn't... I saw this becuase of Jon, but I would never buy it, the plot is boring, the movie is slow and you don't feel any kind of empathy toward the charactors..."
4,What Women Do,Women mark time and changes in their lives in unique ways. These women represent all 'stages' of womanhood. Well done. I loved the way the women all made movement forward in the telling of this story. Tells several stories in an engaging way.
2,"Without Jon Bon Jovi, I would have given it ONE star.",This was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was boring if not non-existent. The only redeeming quality was the fact that the scenes with Jon Bon Jovi were cute and not depressing.
3,Emotionally Wrenching,"Elizabeth Perkins gives a tortured performance as a suddenly widowed woman who must find the courage to go on. Instead of getting bogged down in self-pity, the plot manages to also tackle the very different demons of the three most important women in her life. This movie is emotionally wrenching as each woman finds the courage to move ahead.If it is Jon Bon Jovi that you are renting it for, stick to his music videos - this movie isn't for you."
3,My review...,"I enjoyed the movie. I rented to just to see Jon's performance, which he did very well! I'm not suprised because he is so talented. The story was very touching and I thought it was an overall good movie...more of a chick-flick."
2,Jon's good... the movie is boring....,"Well, the few times Jon is in the movie are good - you see he actually can act. But the movie itself is rather boring, too long and it doesn't happen so much."
3,TI AMO ELIZABETH PERKINS ! !,That is all I can say about this movie. The movie was O.K.but with a cast like this I expected more. Elizabeth Perkinsand all the others do what they can with the material they'regiven. All in all very average. I hope to see Elizabeth Perkinsin a better role soon. If you want to watch a good movieabout mourning than watch three colours blue with JulietteBinoche.
4,Another 70s show,"Well, I got this film for two reasns:1. It is a 70s Hammer (or Corman) film, starring the horror film legend, Boris Karloff2. It is an HPL adaption (based on The Colour out of Space)Well, it was pretty good, even though it was made back when. Thank fully, there was no artsy-fartsy 70s-style hippie geek versions of rituals that ran amok in other films like Dunwich Horror, Crimson Cult, and Wicker Man.It was, unfortunatley remade into a love story, so watch out for that, but managed to remain pretty good anyway.Boris Karloff was his usual dark, sinsiter self, the main guy was allright, and the movie ended up being a decent adaption.Old Hammer, Corman, Arkoff fans will like it and HPL fans will, too.blah blah blah, four tentacles up...something something."
3,"No classic, but still enjoyable.","This mild, but unexceptional adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's ""Colour Out Of Space"" features horror king Boris Karloff as wheelchair-bound patriarch Nahum Witley who discovers that a fallen meteorite is causing the physical disentegration of several people. It's the familiar ""some things are better left alone"" theme, and the film has very little on Lovecraft's original story, but Karloff's strong presence makes it most worthwhile. For a better filmization of Loveraft's literary genius, see THE DUNWICH HORROR, also directed by Daniel Haller."
3,Why not re-release??,I first saw this movie in the early seventies. Some aspect of the movie made enough of an impression on me to have me looking the internet over for a copy for my own personal collection. I would love for this movie to be re-released and to feel the eerie atmosphere inherent in the movie once again.
3,BASED ON LOVECRAFT'S THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE,Even though this movie does not follow HPL's story it is still exciting to hear so many Lovecraftian references in a movie. It is a must for all those HPL nuts who can't get enough of the mythos. Let us join forces and demand that this video be re-released!!! I'll take the first five.
2,Another Waste of Karloff's Talent,"Boris Karloff's sinister presence cannot save this disappointing H.P. Lovecraft adaptation. ""Die, Monster, Die!"" plods along until its effective climax, with mad scientist Boris disintegrating in classic fashion. The AIP production is somewhat reminiscent of Karloff's 1936 sci-fi thriller ""The Invisible Ray."" Though he was determined to keep working, the aging horror icon should have been more selective in his choice of projects."
2,"KARLOFF AND CREEPY ATMOSPHERE CAN'T SAVE THIS TALKY ""THRILLER""!","I caught this one on of my HD channels and the film presented in widescreen looked really good. Karloff gives us another grand performance in this atmospheric, but slow moving, talky film. The story is interesting, but it just bored me halfway through. If a film can't hold my attention for a little over an hour.......there is something wrong. Check it out on cable before buying this one."
3,"Get That Healthy, Green Glow...","Some day, a genius like Peter Jackson will take the works of H. P. Lovecraft and make an incredible series of slithering fun. Until then, we've got movies like DIE MONSTER DIE! to give us some minor shivers. Nick Adams plays a man summoned to the Whitley estate by a rotting Freda Jackson, in order to save her daughter Susan (Suzan Farmer) from the family curse. It turns out that dad (Boris Karloff) has been using a radioactive meteorite to mutate animals and grow fifty-pound tomatoes in the greenhouse! His butler keels over dead from radiation sickness and the adventure begins. I like DMD with all of it's goofiness and pretention. Should be seen as a double feature with THE DUNWICH HORROR. Check it out..."
1,why do i need a title for a review?,"the DVD would not play on a standard DVD player, it could only be played on a PCmovie was fine, (that's why I bought it !!!)but the format was not right"
2,Defective - fluke?,"My daughter was given this product as a gift - she has had three LeapPads (Little Touch, My First and LeapPad Plus Writing) and we have loved them as all so this might be a fluke. This cartridge will not maintain a constant enough connection for her to play with. It keeps shutting the unit down and failing to recognize it as a LeapPad cartridge. While I gave only 2 stars, I really believe it may be a one-time problem since we have loved all the other LeapFrog products. I am in contact with LeapFrog to try to solve the problem. Is fun when it works!!"
4,For the Hard-core Genealogy Nut,"This book has an extreme amount of valuable information contained in it, but for the novice researcher, you may want to wait on this one. There's no plot to this book, simply titles, dates & places of birth/death, spouses and parents. Occasionally you'll get tidbits like 'participant in War of 1066' or 'Sheriff of Berkley Castle'."
3,Nice show with missing elements.,"Let me first say, I completely agree with the previous review and I'll add a few more observations. The lack of a live audience was way too obvious so there was no reaction or interaction with each performance. Some of the songs were abruptly ended to accommodate what was a TV commercial or personal comments from the performers.Also, there was very little musical accompaniment with each song. Most performances included either a violin or an acoustical guitar. There was an electric piano on one performance and a harp on occasion. Overall, the show was reasonably well done and the talent of the performers is good but not outstanding. It's a good buy at the current price of about $3.00. I wouldn't recommend spending a whole lot more or you may end up feeling like you didn't get much bang for your buck."
5,A great soundtrack and a greater score,"Ignore the complaints that the Monty Norman theme isn't played bold and brassy throughout the score; the subtle use of notes of the theme woven through the score until the final unveiling at the end make the journey that much more interesting and musical. Great pulsating action music and lovely melodies, especially in the case of the achingly touching Vesper theme, all expertly orchestrated and performed. This is the type of score ignored by the Academy snobs in lieu of obscure esoteric wallpaper sounds (will Thomas Newman ever get the Oscar he deserves?)and is not only a wonderful reminder of a terrific film but also a great musical score that stands on its own."
4,Needs some Chris action.,"Okay, it's nice to see the disclaimer, in hackneyed English no less, which essentially says Chris Cornell's spectacular title music isn't included, but as with all of David Arnold's works, this one is worth the purchase. (And proves David Arnold was a worthy successor to John Barry, despite having to score some of the worst Bond films ever made...)Definitely a must-get for track 4, ""Blunt Instrument"", but it is not a complete soundtrack album. Chris Cornell's piece should have been included. (His album featuring the song, plus another 13 is available elsewhere and is definitely worth the listen... It's also nice to have real musicians doing the title music pieces again...)"
3,Where's the opening song,"This is the only 007 soundtrack that does not have the opening song. Do they think it is that bad not to put it on the soundtrack. This really puzzles me. The rest of the soundtrack is really good. I read that David Arnold was inspired by ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" music for this movie. I don't hear it. But at least it is a excellent movie."
1,Lack of the title track drops this to 1 star,"I don't own this soundtrack, but I own the DVD so I know the songs well enough. I have no problem with them, but I do have a problem when the best song AND TITLE TRACK is not included on the soundtrack. I could not listen to this soundtrack without thinking of what it's NOT, rather than what it is. Not having the best song on here is like having a sausage pizza without the sausage. Considering that the DVD also includes an actual video of Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" makes wonder how in the world Cornell was allowed to keep exclusive rights to this song. Choosing between this soundtrack and the CD single of the title track, I chose the CD single. Too bad I couldn't have everything wrapped up in one neat little package as it should have been."
3,What? No title song!?!,"I've been a fan of Bond soundtracks for a long time now, and still have the LPs from the first 13 Bond movies. When I went to buy the soundtrack from Casino Royale, something told me to check the song list...and I couldn't believe it! They left off ""You Know My Name!"" I can only attribute this to greed or selfishness on someone's part. I was blown away by both the title song and the score. They were original, rich, and really added to the film. Unfortunatey, I just can't justify $14.99 for the soundtrack without getting ""You Know My Name"" and the end title music. Too bad!"
5,Great CD,"This is a really great CD. The only disappointing thing about it is that (for legal reasons,)the 'Title-Song', ""You Know My Name"", sung by Chris Cornell, is NOT on this soundtrack. You have to order it separately. Overall, it sounds great."
3,Bond Soundtrack 50-50,"Got the soundtrack for my Birthday, but like many others here, I am disappointed that the main theme is not included (You know my Name)...whats up with that?Sony is forcing us to go and buy the tune from iTunes (I did - had no choice).Soundtracks are always fun -- but is it my imagination or is David Arnold regurgitating (sp?) old music from the World is Not Enough? He did this in Die Another Day as well. Same music but changed slightly.Otherwise, I'm happy :) LOL"
1,Where is Chris Cornells Song?,Can't really give an honest rating of this collection as i havent purchased it or really listened to it (apart from watching the film). The reason being that Chris Cornells song (you know my name) is missing...i find this incomprehensible as this is a moving and very powerful piece of music that surely should have been included?
3,What's The Difference?,"There are now 2 CD's of the Casino Royale Soundtracks. One titled Casino Royale by David Arnold and the other 007 Casino Royale also by David Arnold. What's the difference between the two?I have bought the 007 Casino Royale CD by David Arnold. A few days later, Amazon released another soundtrack album of Casino Royale by David Arnold and Nicholas Dodd. I would like to know whether the two albums are one and the same. If not, I'd like to know which one is the real original movie soundtrack."
1,"Great movie, terrible soundtrack....","Easily the worst Bond soundtrack yet by the worst Bond composer ever, David Arnold. Why do the producers persist in hiring this talentless individual when people like John Barry are available? We haven't had a good 007 soundtrack since Barry's 1987 THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. It's time for a change!Unfortunatelyy, I've collected all the Bond soundtracks that have come out so far so I guess I'm stuck buying this one too to complete my collection. But I'll wait a few months until I can pick up a used CD for a couple of bucks - all it is worth."
2,No Main Title? I'll Wait For a More Complete Soundtrack,"I saw Casino Royale yesterday and loved the soundrack and score. Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" had been brillianly reworked to include string and horn flourishes that put the tune up there with John Barry's best. Sadly, the exciting jolt of that song has been omitted from this CD, so one never gets to feel immersed in the experience of the film. This was a stupid, stupid decision, if you ask me. Chris Cornell has said that the decision to leave his song off the CD was his alone. First, it is hard to believe that two major forces like Sony and the TWE organization would give Cornell such a right-of-refusal. Second, what kind of moron decides to take his song off of a Bond soundtrack? Cornell is either lying or a complete idiot. He does, however, sound great on the main titles track. It should have been here."
4,"Great soundtrack, but missing the key.","What genius decided to exclude ""You Know My Name""? This is the first Bond Soundtrack that I know of that does not include the title song. Over the years, the Bond soundtracks have always been about 2 things for me: the Bond theme (and how it's woven into the overall soundtrack), and the title song (and how pumped up it gets you for the rest of the movie). There have been some great ones, and not so great ones, but no matter what, they were always on the soundtrack, and I could identify the movie from the title song. ""You Know My Name"", imho, was one of the better ones, and to exclude it is a travesty."
2,Unmemorable,"1. No title song? - A total disrespect for the customer. Sony needs this feedback. This action appears to be a way of suckering dedicated Bond fans into buying an additional piece for their collection.2. David Arnold has done good work before but here he does not seem to draw inspiration from John Barry's great 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' so much as rehash his own tepid 'The World Is Not Enough' score. Although the music adequately matched the scenes during the movie, the tracks do not stand alone. Casino Royale's soundtrack does not evoke images of the film the way a soundtrack should."
1,Scam,"Thank you to all the reviewers who saved me money and grief. I was just about to purchase the CD when I read that the main reason I was going to buy it (The Main titles song) was ommited. And Im sure, they will come up with a second CD, just to make more money."
2,John Barry - Where Are You?,"I vowed that unless I heard 'proper' Bond music in Casino Royale, I would never waste my money on another Bond film.Unfortunately, the soundtrack provided a form of compromise. What we got was a 'Barry-fied' mixture of action-music and strings, the tunes of which I cannot for the life of me recall a day later.John Barry was a genius. I remember running home from the cinema after seeing the Bond films of the 60s, with the music still playing loudly in my head. Even the more unpopular Bond films such as OHMSS, were blessed with wonderful, stirring, immortal themes. I saw OHMSS three times for the music alone! (Ok, ...and Diana Rigg).As others have said on this thread: John Barry is still alive. Bond actors have come and gone, but he was the true success behind the franchise. And he hasn't to my knowledge even been knighted!!!Maybe David Arnold will grow on me, but he does compare badly in my humble opinion."
3,ok but .......where is the main title??,"This is a good soundtrack but i believe this is the first time in 40 something years of James Bond history there is no main title song ,in this case You know my name which by the way is great.A lot of people get the soundratcks most of the times for the main song why,why Sony studios did this mistake?Soon they'll split the soundrack in 2 cd's to force you to buy both? lol"
2,No Theme No Deal,"I have always enjoyed the James Bond film themes which usually featured a top notch performer and a very exciting opening to the Bond Films. I'd never heard of the performer who did the theme in the movie and was frankly disapointed that it was not included in the film soundtrack. Without the Main Title any soundtrack is incomplete to me. Madonna and Sheryl Crow did the last 2 Bond themes, so why didn't they get very popular pop star to sing it? And why didn't they put it on this album?"
3,Good music. . .,"Initially I didn't care much for the soundtrack as it is missing that distinctive, James Bond sound. I especially didn't the theme song. Over time it is not good. It is not up there with previous Bond classic soundtracks like Gold finger or even Live and Let Die.As soundtracks go, it's not a bad buy. As a James Bond soundtrack, it's mediocre at best."
2,Disappointing tray,"I thought it would be a wonderful gift, so I bought four (4) of them. My friends did not like it, they made fun of it as a gift and thought it pretty ridiculous and as far as I know, they have used it only sparingly."
4,"Volume 3 - Orthodox, Greek, Protestant, Anglican Spirtuality","This volume, the last of three by Bouyer on Christian spirituality, surveys Orthodox spirtuality, the rebirth of Greek spirituality, and the development of Protestant and Anglican spirituality. Erudite, brilliant, and endowed with teaching capacity, this is a book to be read more than once, and kept as a reference."
3,Why,"I loved all of the Song of the Lioness books but I hated this one. It was a great book but it made me cry. If you want to read this I suggest you read the other books in the series first if you haven't all ready. I just don't like the way everything ended. (Why did the Series have to end too. Ms. Pierce, if you ever decide you want to write another book about Alanna and what happens next, PLEASE do!)"
3,eeeehhhh,"It could have been worse. After the wham-bam duo of ALANNA and IN THE HANDS OF THE GODDESS i don't think it could have been much better either. now that the whole jon thing is out of the way, ms. pierce felt the need to add in ANOTHER guy to confuse alanna...does 'monogamy' mean anything to her? not that i didn't think the karate guy was cool, i did. but come on! and i totally agree with one of the other reviews (scroll down a bit)...i had always pictured george as 40 too! what's that all about? i had to tape ""George"" over my poster of ethan hawke to get myself into the right mind frame! :) but it's good, just don't expect it to be as good as the first two!"
4,"Great, Could Be Better","This was the only Lioness Quartet book I read. I thought it was good, but it could have been better. For one thing, what's with all that romance? The romance parts were boring. I picked up this book hoping that it would be about an independent woman who could do without a boyfriend, and I was disappointed. However, it IS a very interesting book, and I enjoyed it."
2,disappointed after the first two books,"I really enjoyed the first two books in the quartet; they were amazing. The author brought the storyline together and built likable characters. Alanna's character was solid and endearing as well as the other characters. Made me want to go out and purchase the other two books. Having read a few of Pierce's other works, I had no qualms about buying these last two books in the quartet. I was aghast. A strong, determined woman does not have to be one who is also promiscuous. My goodness! Was Alanna willing to sleep with anyone who was interested?? Would not want our young girls getting it confused. A female does not have to be a bed hopper in order to be successful or strong. So, if you have issues with unrestrained sexuality, do not read these last two books. Just enjoy the first two and call it a day."
5,Tamora Pierce is a genious! Great book!,"Mmk, I got the first book in this series from a friend that had gotten it from the library (she hasn't read that book yet...) and I just have to say: TAMORA PIERCE IS THE BEST AUTHOR EVER~! I highly recommend that you read this book, if you're 5, 10, 15, 20, whatever! You will love it, just as I have. Right now I am finishing up In The Realm of the Gods, The Immortals Quartet, by Tamora Pierce; it is just as fantastic as the other books.--Niomi"
1,Disappointed,"I truely enjoyed the other books the Lioness series and they remain my favorite series. I especially loved the first two books. Whereas 'Woman Who Rides Like A Man' irked me, 'Lioness Rampant' really tore my hopes down and I was horribly disappointed. I respect the other readers who enjoyed the ENTIRE quartet, but I must say that it was not the book for me. The characters seemed to lose their 'edge' and became too single-minded. The first two books were a perfect blend of love and war. However, the third book was almost entirely about love and the fourth book was almsot entirely about war. I bear no grudge against Tamora Pierce and I believe that she wove the stories with wonderful imagination and care, but I wish I hadn't read the last two."
2,The first ones were better,"After the first books set such a good standard, it was quite shocking that this one slipped so badly. Hauling up an old enemy and wandering from place to place were no substitute for a good plot."
3,Typos take away from experience,"I really enjoyed the whole Song of the Lioness series. They were enjoyable, fast-paced, and a new take on a spunky, independent female heroine. I was disappointed though, because the Kindle version had so many typos. Over half the time, the main character's brother's name was mispelled so you couldn't tell if his name was Thom or Thorn. I love the books though."
3,classic ya series,"So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.Good series, overall. but prefer the Immortals series.I think the reason I both liked and disliked this series is George. He was the only character in this series I actually liked wholeheartedly and felt he deserved better than Alanna finally coming back to him after doing everything else on her list."
4,2nd best book to the Bible,"This honestly was the best of the series, the suspense of this book was almost unbearable, from when Alan, oops, went in search of the Dominion jewel, to when to when she confronted the Duke during the great battle. I totally enjoyed this book and had to pry it from my hands to put it down, out of all the books I've read this is my 2nd favourite. But the best bit of this book was the fact that there was a focus on george and his kin, and hats of to Tamora Pierece in coming up with the idea of introducing Ralon of Malven as the infamous Claw, it was truely ingenius. (Sorry about the spelling and punctuation)"
4,READ IT,"LIONESS RAMPANT is, in my opinion, one of the best books in the series.In a nutshell: Alanna goes to the Roof of the World to get the Dominion Jewel. She nearly freezes to death before she succeeds. In the meantime, Roger is back and nastier than ever. Somehow he's killing Thom, and Alanna is convinced that he's got soemthing up his sleeve.Meanwhile, Jon's life is in danger from some old villians, including (gasp!) Delia, who was always in leauge with a certain someone...And George has to face Claw, a notories rebel theif who wants to become Rogue but doesn't play fair. Jon also attempts to make George ""respectable"" and almost suceeds.George still loves Alanna, but now she's off roaming with a Shang Dragon and George doesn't know what she feels about him.The climax is at Jon's cornation as King, when old evil comes to wreak new havoc...Can Alanna defeat her oldest and greatest enemy?And will she ever own up to her true feelings for a certain Rogue?"
4,A nice ending and rather good book.,"The first time I saw this book, I liked it because it was large (Always good for ending a series.). Although parts of the book were a bit boring, I think it's an all-around good book that ends an all-around good series. I think, though, it was a quite brattish of Allana to walk out on faithful old George after what she was doing before. And that to people who think Jon was meant for her! He's soooo spoiled! Although the second book was the best, this one is good to and goes as a tie with the 1st book, both beating The Woman Who Rides Like A Man all hollow. but for people who think the ending was sad, you guys should read the Goldan Compass and it's runner-ups! They are great books (and tragic...)! Well, my reivew is about this book... You should read it. (If you haven't already) There are good books out there, but this is one that is worth buying in hardback."
5,"A fabulous, many threaded adventure!","I adored this book! It developed Alanna's character to the fullest, introduced other, glorious characters, and provided ingenious tie ins to the other 3 books of the series! It was an extremely well written book, with the perfect mix of humor, tragedy, adventure, and love. My favorite part of this book was how it did not center on just one part of the story, like the Dominion Jewel or Roger's return from the dead, but instead centered on all of these, and many more! You will find yourself being drawn into the story, no matter what age you are!"
2,I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ROMANTIC,I was rather depressed after reading this story. I can't believe that TP wrote this book. I kept hoping that stupid female would wake up and go back to her first love. I thoughtthe book might get better at the end but it didn't. I wish I had never read it.
4,"Excellent Book, Not fully understood if you have not read the other three books before it...","As the title says, this book is a great end to a great series, and leaves the reader of the other three preceding books wanting more. Fortunately, there is various other books following the end of this series. It has (spoiler here) Alanna finding the Dominion Jewel and giving it to Jonathan. This is also where Alanna meets Liam Ironarm, a Dragon Shang. As an avid reader of most of the Tamora Pierce book series, This is one of my favorites. The book itself ends with a climax that brings back other memories of the previous books, but does not leave that sense of ""drop-off"" that other books have. That is the sense that the reader has the feeling that he or she needs to know more about the series and wants another book."
3,Four is just too many,"As the conclusion of this series it was alright. The first two books were WAY better, and the third one was pretty good as well. As for this one, I found it just plain DUMB with all the ending stuff. ...This was not a great book, and was far surpassed by the first two (the third was better also)."
3,Not bad! . . .,"Well, Alanna's attitude is still hopeless: striving to be ""tough"", falling in love with everyone in sight, sleeping with them, and still unable to decide when a proposal comes along.Okay, I'm tired from saying the same thing to all the books in the Lioness Quartet. This one at least deserves some recognition. Alanna, well, she's still the stuck-up, bratty player all right. And the people around her seem to love her for it, but oh, well, the plot in this book was great. Tamora Pierce could've sped things up at bit, though. The ending was superb - not just because it finally freed me from reading the books (I wanted to see if Alanna changed at all in between the books), but there was lots of action and excitement and the resolution wasn't bad. This and IN THE HAND OF THE GODDESS were the better ones in this series."
4,Perfect Finale - more please!,"Although never able to match up to the brilliance of In the Hand of The Goddess (well it would be impossible, wouldn't it?), this book rounded up the series really well. I particulary liked Buri, and we got to know more about minor characters like Eleni. The return of Ralon was good too. And I liked the idea of Liam too. I've read other reviews where people say it was a wrong idea to put in this relationship, but Alanna was pretty confused, and showing this affair and its difficulties was one way of showing the other side of the heroine. And anyway, no-one complains about all Jon's women! (at least three)! Anyway, read this book, it is fabulous, but if you've read the first three, you'll be so addicted, you'll have to read this anyway!"
5,This Book RULES!!!,"This book is so awsome. For all of you who didn't like the way Alanna falls in love ect., she is just human. She has her flaws. That's why she lost so much in the end. Everything worked out, but it's not the fairy tale 'and they all lived happily ever after'. I still love this book."
1,quality,When I first looked at the book it looked completely fine until I opened it. I read it to page ten then the first ten pages fell out. The binding of the book is horrible. I can predict that soon the rest of the book will fall out. No wonder it was so cheap!
5,Right choice,There are all kinds of things to consider when ordering atv parts. This is one time when the price and the quality were both right. The aluminum bar is sturdy and looks perfect. Fit without a catch and the cost was reasonable in my opinion. so 5 stars for this purchase.
3,"True Romance with a stranger romance. Tuff, tuff stuff.","A jewel robbery goes bad, leaving a Mom and child without a Dad. Payback takes a while but the road it takes is wild. Not for the squeamish, but then that seems to be Harvey's niche. Shot in L.A. with style."
4,"a great Harvey Keitel role,","In this movie Harvey Keitel plays a low key Clint Eastwood, the rest is suspenseful and worth a look"
4,Pretty darn good crime thriller,"Harvey Keitel (Roy) plays his usual self-assured character leading a group in a jewelry heist, and then goes up against a myriad of contract killers.Famke Janssen is very convincing as a mother of two and wife of one the jewelry heist gangmembers who gets caught up in the mess. Famke is very attractive with or without makeup, (and very tall-with those long legs). Timothy Hutton, Roy's brother (killed off early by Dorff) and Lucy Liu have minor parts.All I can say is you'll be so very happy when Harvey Keitel smears Stephen Dorff's brains all over the pavement, towards the end of the movie. Stephen Dorff gives and absolutely first-class perfomance of a double-crossing, short-tempered, quick-drawing psychopath, who won't be double-crossed (as he has double-crossed) by anyone. Why does Harvey Keitel always seem like that ""cleaner-upper"" character in Pulp Fiction? You'll love the lawyer's office ""laptop computer"" scene. Classic."
3,Keitel,"This was better than I thought it would be, particularly due to Keitel and Janssen's performances. A little more Timothy Hutton would have been terrific too, as their relationship, as brothers was a success.After all, this genre (betrayal & underworld/a brothers revenge)isn't original. But the environmental use of Los Angeles' working class and industrial areas adds it to a list that includes To Live and Die in L.A., The Limey, Heat, and Training Day...A good list indeed.But I return to Keitel who stabalizes this film, even with the histriotics of Stephen Dorff and the so-so script."
2,just meh,"I bought this book cause I really love fiction based around developing nations, especially the middle east. So I was hoping for a vivid portrayal of life in Lebanon through the wounded characters eyes.I just wasn't able to get into it because of the style of writing. It jumped around a lot, and not in a particularly exciting way. While I very much enjoy side stories, these did not pull me in and I did feel like I was really getting to know the character, unless the character is one of those boring people who can describe things really well, but not make them meaningful to the reader.Needless to say I never finished it, but maybe it gets better towards the end."
5,SMOOTH,"THIS CD IS A SMOOTH AS SILK.. THESE TWO GO TOGETHER LIKE PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.. I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS, BUT NEVER PERFORMED TOGETHER BEFORE. HOPEFULLY, THEY WILL DO AN ENCORE, BUT IT WILL BE HARD TO TOP THIS ONE. EVERYONE THAT HAS HEARD IT AT MY HOUSE, HAS PURCHASED IT. THEY LOVE IT."
1,enough to make me sick,"This book was absolutly awful. The central plot was just stupid, and the book was boring. If you want to read a good novel about mythology try ""Inside the Walls of Troy"". Throw Saberhagens in the trash."
2,What the--?,"Starts off good, then degenerates into an absolute mess. Saberhagen's got goodwill to spare with me, so I'll try the next book. But what a disaster! People pop in and pop out; the plot twists and then goes back to where it was; boots in one chapter become sandals in the next. Don't the people at Tor read these things?"
1,A protection that do not protect...,"You see, when you first buy this product and receive it, you can actually see why it's so cheap ! The belt clip is really dangerous, if you don't want to give your ipod a look what concrete is like, do not EVER clip it to your belt ! And what about the protection ? Well, apart from the fact that dust comes inside and slowly but surely cover the screen, that you can't plug a headphone correctly (Take a Sony XD-100 for instance, it will always unplug when you run or walk a little bit faster than average !). Still, it's a protection, it protects, but if you have to choose one, do not take this one !"
2,Misleading Description,"My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video. The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb, and this case won't close around the 60gb iPod. A secondary complaint is that, though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks, there is no protection for the screen. It's just a hole in the case (like the hole for using the wheel), and I just require more protection for my video iPod. A third (minor) complaint is that there's a non-removable knob on the back of the case, for attaching the belt clip, and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket. I'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen, too."
2,good case bad clip,well the case is sturdy as a rock but the clip is super delicate I broke the clip when i was trying to take it off in the first 2 weeks of having this product.
1,Very hard to set up,"Do not recommend this product, very hard to understand the set up, not explained correctly in brochure, in event of electric shutoff you need to go over the setup again which is not easy."
3,Works,"Works so far after 3 weeks. But one night is was acting funky. Half dim feature did not work and motion sensor was wonky.But since it's fine.This is not my first unit, I've got 4 around the house and they are not long term units. They tend to fail after a few years."
2,Manufacturers Defect?,"I purchased one of these, it arrived in an undamaged box, but the plastic casing that connects the sensor to the lights was completely sheared and you could see the wire underneath. It just dangled. So I asked for an exchange and when it arrived, the exact same defect was present! Seems like quality control for this lot is bad. I have 3 similar floodlights from this manufacturer and have never seen this issue before. Went to the local hardware store and got a near identical light for a few bucks more. Same brand, no shearing."
3,Worked for awhile-not any more,Bought this product in 2011 and it worked fine for awhile. But now it is driving me crazy. I have tried every possible adjustment and solution and the light comes on at night- for no known reason- and stays on. I have to shut it off from inside the house. But the same switch works 2 other lights that are on simple photo cells that come on when dark and off when light. After many hours of trying I think I will just give up and trash this light.Update- I turned off the duel high-low lighting and moved the direction of the lights. Now working OK.
1,Would not recommend Heath/Zenith motion sensor light,"Just installed my 2nd Heath/Zenith sensor light and just like the first one it just will not work properly. I installed it exactly as the directions stated and tried their trouble shooting remedies but nothing works. Yes, it works fine in the test position but when set to 1, 5 or 10 minutes it just flashes on and off and drives the neighbors crazy.I will trash these two pieces of junk and eat the cost as the box says to ""not return it to the store where purchased"". I don't have time to return it in the mail, etc.My recommendation is buy another brand if you are in the market for a sensor light."
1,Truly a POS. Absolutly worthless stays on all day and night!,"I have purchased two motion sensor lights that were made by Heath/Zenith. Both were faulty. The first one only worked for a short period of time before it died.and the second one never did work correctly. It would come on and stay on. Not only during the night. But it would burn all day long too. By the time you figure out the light doesn't work, you have spent hours of your time just trying to trouble shoot the problems.Fool me once, shame on YOU. Fool me twice, shame on ME.W W"
1,If you want a blinking light...,"If you want a blinking light this is for you, but who wants that? With a 150 watt bulb in each socket, this thing cycles, blinking on and off every few minutes. Eventually I settled for a 20W and a 40W bulb. Believe me, I tried all the setting combinations"
5,terriffic moton sensor security light,We bought this for an exact replacement of the sensor we had. The original lasted the better part of 10 years and finally just stopped working. We bought the replacement and just popped in into the same spot where the old one was. Works great and a great price !
4,Growing up with Roxanne,This is a wonderful book for young ladies and teens everywhere. I loved the honesty of Roxanne. I found it wonderful that she acutally enjoyed her life. Roxanne made me wish to be 12 years old again lusting after lipgloss.Stolz surprises the reader with aging Roxanne in the flicker of a chapter. Roxanne learns lessons as well as teaches them.Don't forget to relish in the end...recipes!!
4,"Light and not too filling, like the perfect pie","Well, let's see. If you think small towns are the heart of America, this is a book for you. If you understand the paradox of wishing to leave a small town hometown while still loving nearly everything about that town, yep, you'll want to try this one. Don't expect any deep exploration of social issues, even though Roxie grows up in the South during the 50s and 60s. Yes, racism and Vietnam are touched on, but with the light touch required by anyone baking a pie. Entertaining and reminiscent, but not overly challenging."
4,great coming-of-age story,"This book follows the life of Roxanne Milner, from age 12 to mid-thirties. We watch grow up from a baseball-playing kid to a mother of a six-year-old. We watch her play, date, go to college, get married, and have a child. We empathize with her during life-shattering events, as well as cheer her on through mundane ones. This book is a great story about the life of a girl, her dreams and aspirations and fears, for 20 years of her life. There are also recipes added in the back for the aspiring chefs among you."
4,the circle of life,"world of pies follows the circle of life. from a tomboy who wants nothing to do w/ baking to the mother of herself, this book follows the life of roxanne milner, a small town texan girl.starting in the middle of the civil rights movement, roxanne learns about the dignity of giving credit where credit is due, when a woman wants to enter her colored maid's pie into a local pie baking contest. each vignette revolves around some aspect of dignity: from her father taking swim lessons w/ children to surprise his wife to her tough love approach to her vietnam vet cousin's drug and alcohol problems.there are revelations about the different aspects of love. roxanne has a wonderful teachere in the person of her mother, a very progressive and strong woman.and the food.... there is always food. food is the metaphor for love and fortunately karen stolz gives us the recipes for them. they are simple and basic (and delicious) like the lessons that the author exposes"
4,World of Pies...Yummy,"Karen Stolz has written a charming little book of life in Annette, Texas in the '60s and '70s. The story begins in 1962 and twelve year old Roxanne Milner is more crazy about baseball than boys. This was the year of the Pie Fair, an event that changed Annette, Texas in a small way and started Roxie on her journey to adulthood. World of Pies is a smart, witty and often poignant look at a young girl growing up, told with such insight and humor, that it will vividly take many back to that time in their own lives. Ms Stolz's characters come alive on the page and are memorable with strong voices. Her scenes are true to life, as Roxanne moves through each rite of passage towards adulthood. World of Pies is a very human story and a wonderful snapshot of small town life."
4,Yummy and Universal!,"This delightfully delicious little book is just as comforting as the recipes it contains. Anyone who came of age in the 60s will enjoy the trip to Annette, Texas, and meeting Roxanne. The book realistically portrays growing up and the joys and heartbreaks along the way with a heavy focus on the importance of family. I'll be anxious to see what this author has planned next."
3,The Man From Planet X (1951)-Sci FI Gold.,"Despite its age The Man from Planet X (1951) actually holds up pretty well for me. As a five or six year old kid I first saw this movie by myself on my grandfather's TV and the scene through the space craft window really frightened me. I suppose all fans remember that incredible scene on the moors. It must be admitted that the wording of the script and acting were on the poor side, but pretty standard for old sci-fi. I recently saw it once again on a remarkably clear rented DVD. I decided after screening it to buy a copy from Amazon for my sci-fi collection. It rates only three stars today, but I must add it to my DVD collection of sci-fi gold. The key phrase is ""low budget"", but think about how much was spent on the recent remake of the Day the Earth Stood Still that could have been invested in about a million entertaining low budget thrillers."
3,Battlefield Scotland...,"The mysterious planet-x swoops into telescope range, getting scottish scientists excited. Amazingly, an alien craft lands in the fog-covered countryside, occupied by a strange visitor with a giant head sporting rather stylish gardening gloves. My one complaint is the small amount of screen time for the title character. This results in a lot of talk, little action, and vast patches of dullness. Still, as a 50s sci-fi epic, TMFPX isn't completely terrible..."
3,Trailer somewhat misleading for a scifi invasion film,"The film is a mix of Day The Earth Stood Still, War of The Worlds, and the Quatermass series. The trailer gives the impression of a horror film. As such, it doesn't satisfy any audience. Although treated seriously, the film suffers from the alien behaving either ambiguously or inconsistently. Interesting for fans of the genre, but not a must see."
4,B SciFi Movie for the Thinking Man,"There is more than meets the eye here. Alien space ships not withstanding, this is an intelligent film with good characters bolstered by good dialogue. The deliberate pace of the film and the intelligent point of view displayed through the characters make this good filmmaking. Not your conventional ending either."
4,Famous Mothers of Filmland,"Although I had seen this movie on TV many times beginning in the mid 1950s it's always funto watch again. I saw it again the other night on TCM and the host informed us that thethe sweetheart of the film, Margaret Fields, was none other than SALLY FIELD'S mother.Small world this 'Planet X.'In addition to the above TCM's (great channel) host mentioned that nobody in the cast even knewthe name of the poor guy in the X Man suit. It was remembered though that he could be heardduring shooting breaks that the suit (costume) was unbearably hot and that he wasn't beingpaid enough for the torture.Back in the 20th century when a complete amature (see 'NOVA' PBS') discovered the planet PLUTOit was originally named Planet X ! Now that PLUTO has been downgraded to a non-planet due tothe latest definition of same, the poor guy can't even go home."
2,Scarey Alien,"I haven't seen this one yet, but from what I understand, the Alien bears an uncanny resemblance to the Kid From Deliverance. Now THAT's worth watching!"
3,Small type makes this book very difficult to read,"I eagerly anticipated this book because I am very interested in food history. As another reviewer mentioned, it is largely a collection of photographs, organized by decade, highlighting popular recipes, prepared foods, applicances and advertisements. As someone middle-aged with bifocals, I found the small print in this book extremely difficult to read. This difficulty is exacerbated by some of the color arrangements, which do not provide enough contrast between the color of the type and background. I know that I would really like this book -- if I could see the tiny print well enough to read it. Too frustrating. I would not buy this again."
2,Needs a lot of improvement,"This is probably one of the worst books on food history I've ever read. One would think that since the publisher released the book several months late, they might have used that extra time to proofread. The number of typographical errors truly astounded me, and made the book difficult, if not agonizing, to read. There is very little actual text, as this is primarily a picture book. While the pictures are of fine quality and brought back many memories, I noticed that the captions didn't always match up with the pictures. And while the brightly colored pages did make a visually interesting background, it also made the tiny type rather difficult to read. Overall, there is very little to learn from this book, and anyone who is interested in food history would be better served by one of the many other books already on the market."
1,No windows 64 support,"I purchased this for the same reason the other reviewer did - middle of the road price. Big mistake!Despite their advertising drivers for Windows 64 bit, they don't support Vista-64 at all. They also don't support Windows XP Professional 64 bit with Intel! When tech support is contacted, the basic response is tough luck - you have choosen the wrong processor, we only support AMD!Avoid this product if you need future-proofing. And it calls into question Promise Technology in general.Customer orientation seems seriously lacking."
3,OK back in the beginning of the 2000's,"I had this card for a raid 5 system. It worked OK, but there were better cards then and there are certainly better ones today (2011). Overall the Fasttrak card was just OK. I never had a failure and it was as fast as the hard drives of the day, but today I think it is a dinosaur."
5,exercising with susan,"The tape is good. I would love the ""Moving"" tape even better. Susan's ""Moving"" tape includes exercises with hand weights also."
5,back to the step workout,"I used this tape back in the 90's and liked it then. I have not been getting the results I wanted at the gym and stumbled over this at the amazon site and decided to go back to it. I have only been using it consistently for a few weeks and am noticing good results in energy, strenth and toning. I am aware it is a little harder as I am older and heavier than when I first used it. I am confident this will result in the outcome I am looking for. The ability to modify at all times makes this workout good for anyone."
5,The Best for Serious Exercisers.,"Susan is the best. Period. This video is for all levels, ages and sizes. If you are truly serious about exercising for a lifetime, buy this video. You will actually use it. A great investment in your health."
4,Good aerobics workout,There are too many facial shots of Susan but as ususal her workouts are simple and easily modified according to fitness level. It is a great go between with muscle building exercises.
5,Truely inspiring,"The book Stop the Insanity,has been my Bible for the last 5years.The Video Lean,Strong and Healthy really does get you Lean Strong and Healthy."
5,Love this workout,"I wish this workout was on dvd, I have burned through 3 copies already. I am an exercise video junkie, if it's been made I probably have it, but this video is my ultimate favorite. It's inspiring and a great workout."
2,Good for beginners,The moves are easy enough but over all the video isn't very fun to do. Susan Powter looks like a Gremlin which can be amusing while doing the video. She does have a lot of energy and is encouraging but overall it isn't exciting
3,Mixed bag,"I bought this after hearing Michaal Myer speak about Qigong at a conference and was impressed with him. On the DVD he comes across as somewhat less polished and professional, which makes sense I suppose, as he is not an actor. The setting is outside in nature, which is nice, but some of the sequences are hard to follow especially as you must turn away from the screen and can't watch him. It's ok and I'll use it once in a while."
2,If you like endless accounts of who will fight whom...,"This started out great, with developed characters, Prospero and his daughter, and an intriguing and powerful sorcerer. Unfortunately it became an endless exploration of who was on whose side, who was going to fight whom and why, and what the political consequences would be. Characterization is fine, but this is anything but ""character driven."" It's another exploration of an author's imaginary world. Well-written, but became too boring At about page 100, I skimmed to page 200 - no change, same things going on. I won't finish it."
4,Peter Kreeft,"I really enjoy Peter Kreeft's books, so this one was not a surprise to me. I like this book more as a reference guide to questions that I may have. It is truly awesome. I would have given it 5 stars except when I received the book I was dissapointed that it was a used book, when I paid for a new book. It was stained in the inside. Unfortunate... but I got over it pretty quick."
1,Protestat Bashing at its worst,I read this book as part of a required class in college. It is an appalling lambasting of Protestant faith shallowly disguised as a guide to Catholic Christian Faith. Shame on Peter Kreeft.I as a Protestant who never critized Catholics was angered and insulted at every reference to Protestantism. It definetely generated much hard feelings toward me by my classmates and has created in me a bitterness toward catholics that greives me.
3,"Good, but not my style of read",Still haven't finished it ... doesn't grab.a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r
1,Indestructible? We wish!,How excited we were to give this new indestructible toy to our 5 month old puppy who had pulled the stuffing out of all of her soft toys... and she loved the kahuna toy when we gave it to her. How dissappointed we were the NEXT MORNING when we woke up to see stuffing everywhere!So for us... this toy wasn't even close to being indestructible.
3,I have a 5-Star Chewer,"My dog chews threw everything including this toy. It's tougher than other soft toys, but even supervised she chewed through it in five minutes. It's not totally destroyed so she is still playing with it, so i gave it 3 stars."
1,Too good to be true!,"i got this pen$$ just 3 months ago and the black part of the pen is already peeling off, now it looks horrible!!"
4,Corporations - Legal Protection,"This was the first book I've read on creating corporations. I like how Childer's talks about the various business entities one could have and the pros & cons. It was a medium read book, not super easy, but not so difficult that someone with very little knowledge of corporations could understand.I also read his other book on Asset Protection, which repeats some of the things in this book. It just further drives the point home because this can be a tough thing to understand.I'm in the process of setting up my own Nevada Corporation through a lawfirm and through this book, I was able to help minimize my questions and ask reasonably intelligent ones. I'm anxious for the process to finish. Good book and I highly recommend this an his Asset Protection book. I have the Million Heirs book, too, but I haven't read it yet."
3,a lot of info but lacks examples,This book did have a lot of information but it lacked examples that would allow you to better understand how this info could be put to use. In my opinion it was too much of a text book.
2,"Poor copy, information lifted from another author.","I purchased this book expecting new information, something in greater detail than what the author has written. This book copies the format and information from ""The Nevada Corporation Handbook"" by Derek G. Rowley almost chapter by chapter with a few of Childer's experiences and what if's scenarios fitted into pages as if it were his own information. Your money would be better spent on Rowley's book, which is more in depth, and without wasteful commentary. I am really disappointed in Childer's book and can't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Nothing New,"This book has nothing new. Everything I read here I read in Derek Rowley's book. Childers at least read Rowley's book, since he seems to regurgitate word for word what Rowley said."
5,Philosophical Ruminations on Thucydides,"This is the best book-length treatment of Thucydides available from a truly philosophic perspective. Orwin looks at Thucydides through the lens of political philosophy and the question of justice. He does not attempt to locate Thucydides in his ""historical context"" or interpret the father of political history in light of the modern prejudice that looks for an author's ""ideology""; rather, Orwin seriously considers whether Thucydides has given a true account of that which he intended to describe, namely, the nature of the human possibilities of war as such, regardless of time or place. Distinguishing Orwin's interpretation from all others of which I am aware is a thought provoking analysis of the role piety played in the motives of the actors described by Thucydides. This is an uncommonly good work that serves as a catalyst for thoughtful reflection on the nature of humanity."
2,Below average book,"This book deals with one of the most philosophical observers on the human condition in the most boring and ""scholarily"" manner. Consider that Orwin has spent over 15 years writing this, it should read better than an average graduate student paper. Orwin's take, for example, on the Plague is formulac and vague. (how many times can Orwin use the word, ""body"" to explain this passage?) Much more could have been said on the plagues relationship to political ideas, for example. Overall, this work serves to illustrate that Orwin is better suited to write as a journalist and not someone concerned with ideas."
2,Muffin Pan,"This 6 cup pan has larger cups than our old muffin pan which appears to cause my wife problems with some recipies. Also, she says that the dark finish, or something, causes the bottom of the muffins to get darker than expected from viewing the darkness of the top of the muffin."
1,Don't buy this,"It broke when shipped, thin plastic, If my tools even looked at this box it would be in pieces"
4,Don't Forget Tim!,"Nobody's yet mentioned another stand-out member of the cast of this film: Tim Thomerson as ""Lester,"" the villain of the piece. His quirky and over-the-top portrayal makes Lester one of the most hilarious and memorable comic movie villains of all time.The film is rife with running gags, visual humor and clever bits of dialogue (as when one character describes life in the post-apocalyptic big city as being ""kinda paranoid and audio-visual;"" while another summarizes life in the lawless desolation of Zone 7 this way: ""You should see 'em out there, playin' Twister and revertin' to their animal natures!"")You'll need to watch it more than once to catch all the visual gags; my favorite being when Melanie Griffith consults her Thomas Bros. Guide to the Forbidden Zone.This film is plain good fun, and not remotely as insulting to one's intelligence as half the big-budget, ""blockbusters"" out there. For a fun David Andrews double-feature, try this one with Stephen King's ""Graveyard Shift."""
4,"Good sci-fi idea, but not developed completely","A guy has a female love robot, and the name of her model is ""Cherry 2000"". She is quite nice, but for some reason she breaks down, soaks up water and malfunctions.Then the guy goes on a quest to a forbidden zone to find a replacement for her broken body. Along the way, he meets a real woman played by Melanie Griffith. Eventually, he falls in love with the real woman and abandons the robot.I like the story and the special effects. But the movie doesn't explain why the robot broke in the first place (before she soaked up water). And I wished that he stayed with the robotic wife, because this idea is more extravagant."
4,She says she can find,"A Cherry 2000 is a very special kind of robot, and she going to find one. She Says."
3,the mediocre world of the future,"Cherry 2000. I'll make it short and sweet. The movie is a renter for most people. It has some decent action sequences and some cool moments, but nothing spectacular. It's a good 80's movie to watch on a boring summer afternoon, when your feeling nostalgic. Otherwise this movie is not sci fi enough for the hardcore sci fi guy. Not intellectual enough for the brainy movie people, and not dramatic or invovlving for the emotional people. It just kinda hovers on the mediocre. If i were to express my feelings for this movie in one word i would use ""good"" or perhaps a simple grunt ""eh."" accompanied by a shoulder shrug. Rent before you buy"
3,CHERRY 2000,"A GUY TRIES TO FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR HIS OBSOLETE HOUSEWIFE ANDROID,WHO ACCIDENTLY GOT DRENCHED IN WATER,THEN FALLS FOR GRIFFITH WHEN HE REALIZES PERFECT ISNT EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS."
3,Cherry 2000,"Worth watching at least once for anyone who loves scifi. Moves a little slow in some parts, but overall is a good B movie."
5,Cherry 2000 fun,This a great movie to watch. It was really good. I love watching Melanie and her co-star falling in love in this movie.
1,Avid Gardener got nothing to grow...,"We are a family who has been gardening for about 4 years now and have grown a wide assortment of fruits, veggies and flowers... We saw the banana seeds at a local Hobby Lobby, so we bought two sets... Planted as per directions in the flimsy planter and never got a single sprout. Contacted company for more seeds, explained what happened.. Told me it was my fault that we had a brown thumb! Told me to go buy a new set and try again!!! Needless to say I told the ass where he can plant his crappy seeds! Beware a crappy product!!!"
3,poor quality - fall apart at heel,"After a couple of years the heels are falling apart and away from the body of the sock, for some strange reason. Unbelievable for these high prices."
1,Sagging Socks,"These socks DO NOT STAY UP. I am a 150-pound 5' 9"" male, so I obviously do not have inordinately large or oddly-shaped calves, but these socks simply do not stay up. Only the regretfully former Interwoven socks truly stayed up (and were guaranteed to do so). I am extremely disappointed in these socks, and bought six pair of them believing in the positive reviews."
3,Nice...but...,"I love Gold Toe socks. They are comfy and stay up. These socks are a nice, deep brown, almost black. Perfect for work without looking like an old man with lighter brown socks.These are right up there in comfort and elasticity, but, after one wash, they look pretty worn and shrunk. Still comfy, but makes me a little worried about their ability to last. I washed and dried both on permanent press cycle. If they wear out prematurely, I'll come back with an update!"
2,slip,"So these are my second pair of gold-toe dress socks. The first pair I purchased were the ""over the calf"" variety. They are nice and tight and stay up all day long, but I am 5'10"" and they are pretty long up and way over the calf. Seriously, could probably pull them half way over my knees, so they bunch just a little bit behind my knee. So I decided, lets try another pair but mid-calf this time. These are a slightly different material, but they don't stay up nearly as well. Maybe it is just the ""Canterbury"" style and fabric but I would not purchase these again. They are not quite as tight as my other pair. I have medium sized calves so take that with a grain of salt."
1,Not Good Quality,No padding in toe and heel whatsoever. I bought these for my husband and he wore them out in 2 weeks. Won't buy again
5,Excellent basic dress socks,These socks are excellent quality and a very good value. They are not too thick and stay up througout the day without being at all tight. They are dressier than the average cotton sock and aren't itchy and don't fade. Much better than any others I have been able to find anywhere. Gold Toe is the best quality out there.
5,Excellent socks,"These socks are comfortable, wear well and are reasonably priced. In short, they are exactly what I have been looking for and I am pleased to finally locate them."
1,"slippery, no hold socks","these socks are terrible; they simply don't stay on. they slip and slide and fall off the feet, even when in shoes."
5,Best socks I own!,"I started wearing Gold Toe socks many years ago, largely because of their no wear through guarantee. Well, none have ever worn through at the toe, and it seems to take around 15 years to wear them out in general! Of course, they make many styles using various fabric combinations. Whatever style you like should be available in the Gold Toe line. These actually work out much cheaper than low end department store socks, over the long haul. I have bought cheap socks which probably did not last a year, so even if I only paid $1./ pair for them, they were more expensive over the long run than these. Also, these stay up! I hate having a sock that sags, and these don't. You may think that I work for the company that makes these, but I do not. Every word here is solely because I am very satisfied with this product, not only from this purchase, but from previous purchases over the years."
4,Canterbury is the best value for quality,"The Gold Toe brand remains one of the best value for quality options. The quality and feel of the Canterbury is second to none and I've worn lots of dress socks over the year. The Canterbury Canterbury (60% cotton / 40% nylon) is comfortable and cool during the summer / warm during the winter. Although during the winter I do sometimes like to pair it with a silk undersock for extra warmth. The Over the Calf Dress sock is classy and secure (stays up with no hassle) for the business and environment and the regular Canterbury (not over the calf) is cool and comfortable for more casual settings. I'd rate the Over the Calf 5 stars for its exceptional comfortable in that class of dress sock. The regular Canterbury gets a 4 only because it doesn't do anything exceptional, but it doesn't need to. At $18 for 3-pack, it's a good value. If you can get the $13.50 for 3-pack, well then that is a 5-star value."
3,"Fits nice, not the best quality","They fit well. They're comfortable. But one of the pairs already has a hole worn through after only 6 months. I wear these to work to sit at a desk all day. They should last more than six months. Maybe just bad luck, but I can't recommend them because of that."
2,Gold Toe Priced as Fool's Gold,"Amazon leads customers to believe that this average sock is special priced at 3 for $18 -- they list the value as $18 to $72.Yet Gold Toe puts a list price for this 3-pack at $18. These are the same socks sold $7 to $9 at TJ Maxx and etc. Not a bad sock, but a bit expensive."
2,old man socks,"my husband didn't like these at all, he said they came up a little too high on the calf like ""old man socks"". He wears a size 11 shoe & is almost 6 feet tall. I will have to search for a lower cut black dress sock."
3,Wrong colour,"I was already familiar with the brand and was happy to see that it is still very good. Unfortunately, I ordered half dozen blak/half dozen blue but got only a dozen black."
1,Quality no longer there,"I have been wearing gold toe socks for about 15 years now, but as other folks have pointed out, they don't seem to last long at all anymore. They don't seem to get holes, but the heal wears away pretty quickly (I just use them for work, no running or anything and nothing different from my older Gold Toes) I did notice that with this last set of socks I bought that they are no longer being make in the USA. I think they may have changed up the material being used at the same time."
2,Not impressed.,"I saw so many good reviews and I expected much more. I bought two packs and of the twelve socks, one had a hole in them when they were shipped. I didn't worry about it and just used the others. The socks have been through the wash approximately 5-7 times. Of the remaining eleven socks, I noticed that two of them had the elastic strings coming through and one has a hole.I gave them two stars because they are not holding up, but, they are comfortable. A lot of my family members swear by gold toe socks, but, when I tried them, I expected them to last much longer than this."
1,Terrible Quality,"I've had these socks for a month and already holes are starting to develop. I don't know if I got a bad batch, or if Amazon just shipped the cheapest ones they could find for Father's Day."
2,Not what they used to be,"I've been buying Gold Toe socks for years and finally had some that needed to replaced. I bought a package of these and am disappointed. They don't feel like they used to, they aren't as comfortable and they look to be of lesser quality. I can definitely tell the difference between these new ones and the old ones I still have around. I went to a local store to make sure it wasn't just these and the ones they have appear to be the same. They still fit well which is why they didn't get 1 star, but they're definitely not top notch nor worth the price. I'm now looking for a new brand, a bit sad about that."
3,"Good Quality, But......","These socks were a little thinner than I expected and as others have mentioned,the color is a lot closer to black than it is to brown. These socks do not stay as as well as other Gold Toe socks I've purchased."
4,I ordered the wrong item,"My calfs are 17 -18 inches so the ""over the calf"" socks are much better for not slipping down my calf. However these have enough stretch to do a good job. I would still recommend the ""over the calf"" but this brand is my favorite. Many Chinese products are lacking in quality (IMHO) but this is not one of them."
4,these socks fit well,My husband has worn this brand of socks for years. They hold up well and feel comfortable. I do wish I could have found a dark assortment of this style.
2,Not for smaller feet,I'm a size 8 shoe. This sock is sized for a size 10 or higher. Can't speak to whether or not the toes don't blow out as easily as other socks. Will update in a few months.
2,dress socks,The picture made the socks look much thicker than what I received. They are nylon material and are extremely thin.
1,Avoid this fixture,"I bought it in Wal*Mart but wanted to put the review here to make sure that people don't get cheated by this manufacturer.It worked ok for first few months. After 4 months the fluorescent tube burnt out. My complain is not for that. This tube size is manufactured only by Westek. You will be out of luck going to Lowes, Homedepot or Walmart looking for a replacement."
2,lasted 3 months,I purchased several fixtures and one went out on me after a few months (not the bulb but the fixture itself). Its cheap to replace and that is not my main gripe about this product. My main gripe is that Westek is the ONLY company that makes this particular size bulb so you can only replace the flourescent tube through Westek (or a Westek supplier). The color of the bulb is a WARM WHITE so if you were hoping to upgrade the bulb to a cool white or a 6400K spectrum you are out of luck. Energy Wiser makes a T4 in that spectrum only the bulb is about an inch longer. At this point I am looking into LED type fixtures that are sleeker and more compact.
1,Junk,"I ordered two of these. The first one lasted about 9 months, and the second one just 5 days. Don't buy this product. It's junk. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
1,Avoid proprietary junk!!,"Super short bulb life (8000hrs my a$$) and proprietary bulb makes for a One-Star review for sure. Why did I ever toss that receipt? My advice, since you are here reading it after all, AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!"
1,Defective! -- Trust the negative reviews,"I didn't trust the other reviews that said it stopped working after a few months. My mistake!! I bought this in August 2011, and in January 2012, it stopped working. There was a little ""pop"" sound and the lightbulb didn't turn on. I figured that the bulb had gone out, but it was still emitting a little bit of light from the edges of the bulb, actually. I bought a replacement bulb, and it did the exact same thing with the brand new bulb. The light fixture clearly has something defective about it. Do not buy this brand."
3,Not my favorite.,"I love the Tamora Pierce books. I think Pierce is an awesome writer but compared to some of her other stuff this book is a flop. I thought it was boring from cover to cover. She spent most of the time in the desert, thinking how to sort out her problems. It had alot of character growth and you won't understand the fourth (my favorite) withought reading it. It lacked the action and the feeling that makes you want to keep on reading that the other Alanna books had. In conclusion, still good, but way not as good as Tamora's others."
3,The worst of the series,"I love the series, but this wasn't a great book. It lacked real plot, and made Alanna very superior, which I didn't like."
1,This series started out so well,"The first two series was so good. I especially liked the second, where things got more romantic, and I really enjoyed Tamora Pierce's humorous edge. However, in this book, she totally changed the personality of Jonathan to make him arrogant and pigheaded (on purpose) so Alanna would go to George. I also dislike how Alanna's character evolved in this series, notably in this book and the fourth book. She goes back on almost all her previous beliefs that made her so original. Now she just seems to have a lack of morals and sleeps with George and later, the Dragon. Also, her personality, which was so charming before, makes her seem so annoying now. I find this book a very disappointing sequel to In the Hand of the Goddess, which is an excellent read."
4,Good Book but not as good as the first or second one,"Now that there is no major enemy (Roger) like before, it is as if the plot is our of aim or something. I think Jonathan is good in the first book, but starting from the second one he expected too much of Alanna. But sometimes, I think Alanna should make out her mind. She loves him but she ALWAYS hesistate about the marriage thing with him and never with the final guy. (I don't wanna tell) I think Alanna should just tell Jon she likes him as a friend or a protector or something instead of always vowing love to him, which make him very fustrated, too.This book is not with as much action as the other three, and much of the plot can be easily guessed. But in order to get to the fourth book, you will have to read this. But don't take me wrong, this is not as good as the other ones, but I didn't say it was bad."
3,What happened?????? :-(,"I adored this whole series, but I think this is THE WORST book if it. Don't get me wrong, it's still an OKAY, but Alanna changed, I say! Now she is more of an emotional female than the honorable knight we all learned to love. She faints and cries at every turn, and acts more like a foolish jilted maiden at every turn. But all and all, it's still a fair book. FAIR because it is good compared to many other books I've read, but only fair standing in the shade of the other excellent books in this series. So I shall end asking, 'Where, o where has my knight Alana gone?'"
4,The Woman Who Rides Like a Man,"Alanna of Trebond has finally accomplished her dream of being the first female knight in over a century. But she has no idea of the challenges that lie ahead. She is taken by the desert tribesmen known as the Bahzir, and proves herself to be as worthy as any man in combat. The Woman Who Rides like a Man then becomes a shaman and begins training three new ones. As her relationship with George becomes more serious and her relationship with Jonathan well, less serious, her twin is causing a secret disastor that will not be discovered until much later. She then meets the sorceress of Aloise, and takes an item of great importance to Halef Seif, leader of the tribe. This item may be the gateway to Alanna's greatest adventure ever....."
3,Not very good,This book is really boring. I like every other book but not this one. I read it in 4 days pretty much to get over it and get on to lioness rampant. Alanna and Jons fight was horrible. i fell in love with her other books( i've read all the tortall books). So get through it quickly
3,classic ya series,"So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.Good series, overall. but prefer the Immortals series."
2,Lost it's Touch,"This is one of the most dissappointing books in the Lioness quartet by Tamora Pierce. There was too much on relationships, too little on battles... a trait that I thought would stay throughout this series."
1,Not up to par,"Wow! After the first two novels, I thought I'd discovered a winner in Tamora Pierce. But I found ""Woman Who Rides Like a Man"" to be quite frankly, boring. Alanna's character has changed- instead of being an aspiring swordswoman she becomes a shaman and her character changed to a whiny-superior-know-at-all.What made Alanna interesting was her desire to do unorthodox things. IE: Becoming a knight, going on adventures. Now its as though the character backsliding. I read Alanna books to learn about her adventures.. Not about her learning to weave.I also don't particularly care for the older men Alanna keeps going out with, as an adult reader, I find it off-putting... Don't these men have women their own age? George is *way* too old for Alanna.I was disappointed in ""Woman Who Rides Like A Man"" It did not hold my interest, and seemed quite forced."
4,"Alanna~ Changed, but for the better?","Alanna is adopted into the Bazhir tribe: The Bloody Hawk, and when Jon becomes the voice, she changes from the 'I can do anything' Alanna we saw in the first two books to 'I can't do this, it's all to sad'. We see her cry a lot in this book. Jon says something- she cries. If someone would have died she would cry... If you are a hopeless romantic, then this book is more for you then for a person who likes the action. This book doesn't have a main enemy, so it is somewhat split up. She battles this and that, and this... but there isn't one main object she has to overcome. This book revolves mostly around her social life, which, in some parts, isn't that interesting. Defiantly not the best book in the series, but I still recommend it."
3,Not as good as the first two,"The third book in The Song of the Lioness Quartet starts with Alanna joining a desert tribe know as the Bazhir. When the tribe is left without a magician Alanna must train a new one before she can move on. Alanna's personal life also heats up when Prince Jon asks her to marry him!I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first two. The Bazhir plot line, which took up most of the book, just didn't interest me. The book did become more enjoyable towards the end though. I'd recommend just skipping over this book but the last half is important to the rest of the series. Oh well, hardcore fans of this series will no doubt enjoy this otherwise, just suffer through it like I did."
4,What to say.................,"This book was fairly good book, but there were some parts....One thing, it's a good thing Mrs.Cooper gave her that charm against pregnancy, otherwise she have a kid in this book. Like someone who wrote a review before me said 'I do not believe in sex before marriage. Not only does Ms. Pierce mention that Jon and Alanna 'Made love' but she then mentions that she and someone else do too. I would NOT suggest this book for anyone under 12. If you are under 12, then I suggest that you read the immortals series. They're more toned down. (exept maybe the 4th book, but it's not that bad.)"
4,NOT as good . . .,"This book is okay, but it definitely could be better. It kind of drifts from plot to plot, never really settling down to focus on a main problem. But it did start giving you a feeling of tension about the upcoming war (what with Claw and all that). Read this book, definitely, but don't be surprised if you're a little disappointed."
5,And the adventure continues!,"Yahoo! Alanna has become a knight, Duke Roger is gone, and everyone knows she is a girl. Alanna doesn't feel comfortable at home because people are shocked that she is a girl. Anyway she wanted to be a wandering knight right? So she heads off with Coram and encounters the Bazhir, unwillingly becoming their shaman. This book was so much fun, and so much happened. We get to see what happens with Jonathan and George and so much more, not to mention the fact that she has to come to terms with her magic not only to save lightning but to help her new friends in the tribe. You have to read this book it was absolutly a blast"
1,Disappointing,"This third book in the Alanna series had the potential of being very interesting, but I often find (when reading through the entire four books) that I skip over this one, and I don't miss a thing. True, skipping over a book in the middle of a series does cause some minor confusion as to the plot, but to be honest, this book almost has no plot!I was very disappointed with how this book read because I absolutely love Tamora Pierce, and the rest of this series is absolutely amazing... if only this part of the series could have lived up to its predecessors."
1,Loathing Beyond Words,"I don't exactly know how it has happened over the years but Tamora Pierce is the one author I loathe...with a fiery passion. I've tried reading The Song of the Lioness and Protector of the Small series. It's been years since I've read them simply because I found them to be utter junk. I loved Alanna but the series just slid downhill from there. They are completely immoral.I suppose this would be OK except that Tamora Pierce's books are targeted to teenagers. I know lots of teens are sexually active but I don't think it's necessary to market books to them where the characters are morally depraved in that area. I really haven't found any other series in teen lit that seems, in my opinion, to condone sleeping around like the Lioness series does.This series is utter junk.Just thought I would throw in my two cents."
4,This book is uniquely exquisite and draws me in.,The Woman Who Rides Like a Man is funny and thrilling. Its wonderful descriptions captive the reader and keeps the eyes locked onto what's going to happen next. This is a book I would definitely reccomend.
4,"Pretty good, but not her best","If you like Alanna, you'll probably like this book. I prefer #2 in this series, but anything about Alanna's adventures will do. This is a little different from the others, (having basically nothing to do with Tortall), but I did like it."
1,horrible,"I HATED THIS BOOK! Sorry, I just did. What happened to the sweet, strong, lovable character from the first book? Alanna is a total ... in this book. She sleeps with way to many men. Isn't that a bit excessive? I think there is a difference between ""grrowing up"" and sleeping with two different guys in the same month. Give me a break. If you are a all like me AVOID THIS BOOK IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. If not, well, okay, but..."
1,Attention all readers! Throw this book in the trashcan!,"This book is not worth the money paid for it. It praises low standards and tells you that is all right to be a...The Bazhir are neat, but they could do with enforcing morales. Whatever happened to the girl we knew in the first book?"
1,Just.... No,"This series had potential, starting out good in the first two books, but this book is where all hope of a good story was destroyed.First of all, I think in this series they could have been a little bit more creative with how people found out that she was a girl. Both times people found out because by some force of magic her clothes were ripped off. Please.Plus, Alanna sleeps with two different men and I don't like the personality of either of them. The author seemed to see it fit to destroy all the good of the story in this volume.Another disappointment of this series is that we never hear much about what happens to her brother, Thom. And when he is around he acts like a complete jerk.There are far better books out there than this one, trust me."
5,Woman who Rides Like a Man is spellbinding!,"Women have been portrayed as weak, conniving, and inferior. Alanna breaks all of the typical stereotypes to become the first female knight in over a century after eight years as disguising herself as a boy. Alanna is made the first female shaman of the Bloody Hawk a tribe of the Bazhir, natives of the Tortallan desert, and this book describes her journeys, her her triumphs, her losses, and even newfound love. I definetly enjoyed it, and I will read all of Ms. Pierce's books if they meet the standards Woman who Rides Like a Man has set."
5,Some people,"I think that some people get too obsessed with Alanna's love life and miss that in this book she is really discovering herself. It is an excellent book. I think that there should be a movie made about the SOng of the Lioness Quartet and the Immortals Quartet ,(Which is equally good)"
1,SO SMALL!,I bought three of these necklaces for my bridesmaids and returned them the day after they were delivered. The beads were so small that you could hardly tell what color they were! I was extremely disappointed.
1,Don't know about the magazine,"Ordered during late December as a Christmas gift and have not received any printed issues as of Jan. 30, 2013. Won't order magazines through Amazon anymore. This approach hasn't worked out very well. The recipient doesn't use the the internet (yes, there are still people who don't) and doesn't have a Kindle, so I don't know whether that mode of accsss works."
4,excellent book...,"I got this book to get started into backpacking again after many years of not doing it. The recipes and instructions in this book sure beat the MRE's and expensive stuff you get from the store. I've tried a number of the recipes at home and so far so good. I'm not a fan of TVP, which a number of the recipes call for, but hey we all can't like the same stuff--that would be boring wouldn't it? so I just substitute and move on..."
4,Good Resource,This book has lots of great recipes for dehydrated food. I made enough to eat as a meal that night and then dehydrated the rest.
3,"Useful, but not to my taste","This book will be a benefit to people enjoying long hikes deep into inconvenient territory. Beyond that, it is mostly useful only for the helpful hints and a few product reviews. I recommend finding this book at a library or paging through it at a bookstore to make sure it is really what you're looking for before buying."
5,Terrific Book !!,"As a long time cook & recipe book collector, I can attest that this publication can stand alone as just a good recipe book. It is full of tasty dishes.The fact that we were able to prepare & pack 9 healthy,interesting meals for a hike on the AT with direction from this book, made the Backpack Gourmet most valuable.These recipes REALLY can be dehydrated & reconstituted with great success by following the author's direction. I will admit that I was very dubious, finding it hard to believe that a stew or soup could be successfully dried in the home kitchen. It works!! GREAT Book!"
4,"Good recipes, dehydration can be cumbersome","This is a good cookbook. It was my first trail cookbook. I've had it for a number of years, and it's served me well. The recipes are varied and tasty, and I constantly go back for new ideas or old favorites. I give the cookbook only four stars, because I've found better techniques in other cookbooks that I try to blend with Yaffe's recipes.The second cookbook I bought was The Complete Trail Food Cookbook. It introduced me to the idea of dehydrating ingredients first, and then bagging them up into complete recipes for rehydration and cooking on the trail. Yaffe's recipes call for making the entire meal, and then dehydrating it, which tends to be a lot more cumbersome than the method mentioned in the other cookbook.That being said, I definitely recommend this cookbook for its recipes to anyone who is looking for something new and might want to do some of their own tweaking."
5,A MUST-HAVE BOOK,"I have had a copy of this book for at least 15 years. I will not be without it. I have turned to this volume on so many occasions and have found comfort, solace and happiness upon reflection of almost all of the selections. This book will inspire anyone. It is a must-have book."
5,Greatest Gift A Friend Can Give,I have given approximately 50 of these books as gifts during the last 25 years. Everyone has expressed gratitude and reported that it had become one of their favorite books also. I am so excited that they are available again after not being able to purchase them for many years!Sal Salyers
5,Light from Many Lamps,"I purchased 2 ""new"" copies for gifts. One copy was clean and OK, the other copy had black permanent markings on both the top and bottom end pages. This did not make a very presentable gift.The contents I rate as a five but the visual as a one.Virgil Duerson"
4,Fine Motor Skills,"My granddaughters at 18 months needed help with their fine motor skills. I was advised to find pegboard or Lego. I had no idea how hard it is to findeither of these for children under two years. However, Italy to the rescue of the pre-twos!! Quercetti GeoKids make a fine circular board with holes and different color pegs to insert and build with. From there you can build up! The girls love it and play with it often. The pieces are large and colorful, easy to clean and the number of pegs in each color is on the box so you know when to move the sofa and search for missing pieces!!As mentioned, the pieces are large and easier to manipulate than Lego and the girls, now have been able to graduate to Lego which they also enjoy but they still remember and use their GeoKids."
4,Babies love it!,"My baby (seven months old) loves this toy. I never would have picked this out for him but we tested it out at a local speciality toy store and he immediately could pick up the pieces and really, really, liked it. When he drops one he just picks up another piece. Now he is picking up the Daisy mat and dumping the plastic cogs (thus learning cause and effect). As he grows he'll learn to stack the pieces. Your baby will love it even if you think they won't- so go for it!"
5,Lost in Tibet is an excellent book,I found this book to be well written and told a remarkable story of the fliers that bailed out of their airplane over Tibet during WWII.
2,Starts out as Fiction,"I stopped reading a few pages into the first chapter. I couldn't quit thinking about the ridiculous false statements in the 2nd paragraph of the 1st chapter. First it says ""the pilot decided to crash,"" after the engines catch fire, but he doesn't actually crash. Then it says the cause of the fire was because the spark plug gap was too wide which ""let raw fuel run straight through the engines and out the turbines and there it had ignited.""The part about crashing is sensationalism. The part about the sparkplugs is completely wrong since they have nothing to do with the flow of fuel. I'm sure the topic of this story is true but with that many errors on the first page of the first chapter I'm going to find another book on this topic I can trust."
3,"Looks good, but small construction issues and concern about the cushion","Purchased this to have a place to put my shoes and sox on in my bedroom, since my Serta Trump mattress is high enough off the ground that it makes a poor bench for dressing.Came in a large box with several parts and pieces. Took about 2 hours+ to put together by myself. I strongly recommend using a power screwdriver, as some parts would be difficult to screw into the hard wood without power.All joints except one locked very well, but the very last locking joint won't lock properly, causing a loss of rigidity when you sit on it. Nothing major but I would prefer complete rigidity in a piece like this.The cushion isn't page white, more like off white and is high density foam. I expect to have to order replacements every 3-5 years because I feel this is they type of cushion that will break down over time.Overall, I would say this is a good product for the price."
1,Wrong Description and Vendor Still Has NOTCorrected!,"This is quite an attractive watch...for a woman. Vendor has wrong description and still hasn't corrected it a month after my purchase. Vendor didn't respond to ANY e-mail requests. Took over 2 weeks to receive. When it arrived it was not a Men's watch. After numerous e-mails for help I called and left a message. No return call. When I did reach a person, Sara, she was very helpful and issued an RA number and return UPS label. They had had the watch for over a week and still hadn't credited my account. Called back again and they did it while I was on the line. I would not work with this vendor again. Prices are similar to local store prices so it was a ""deal"" anyway."
3,Problems,"I bought this for my friend who seems like the real life version of Sonic. She loves blue things and a particularly fast hedgehog. I wanted to get her something unique that no one else would probably get her and wen I found this I thought it would make a great gift. It looks good, is of a relatively good quality, and it also got here on time. However, I can only give this product three stars. Why? When I recieved this I was HORRIFIED to learn that I had to pay $1.05 because the company sending it to me, hadn't paid enough postage! While the price was good, i was shocked by the extra payment for postage. I was extremely annoyed by this and will most likely NOT buy from this company again."
1,water leaks bad,installed my new extang solid fold on my new 2012 silverado first rain here in seattle opened the cover and nothing but water on all my items inside the bed tried to seal areas were leaks were but it filled the inside of the panels with water only way to get water out was to stand covers on end and let water run out . took extang off my new chevy will look for something better for my new truck any body want a free extang solid fold cover ?
1,Flew off my truck at 55mph!!!,"Bought it 05/21/2012 and on 09/27/2012 it flew in 5pm rush hour traffic at 50 to 55mph. Thank God it did not hit anyone or anything. It got ran over by hundreds of vehicles before I could get turned around and back to it. (This was on an interstate). When I got back to the area it had been ground to bits and shreds. Check Google for reviews. I wish I had. It has happened ALOT! Extang says I am a liar, but my bed rails are bent from where it tried to hang on."
5,Great tonneau!,"I bought one of these for my 2001 Silverado and it has been awesome. It literally only takes a few minutes to get on and off. When it's on, the bed is easily accessible and it looks sharp on the truck. Great product."
4,Extang Trifecta solid fold truck bed cover - NO LEAKS!,"We have had terrible leaks with the solid fold tonneau cover we installed last year. All we get from Extang is more 0 rings that we install with the same results: WET!Extang gave us a new Trifecta that is NOT leaking after 6 months! We're DRY now. THANKS, EXTANG!!"
4,"Good product, but not perfect.","First I want to say that this is a great idea for a product. And it will work well for most ties. But there are a couple things that could be improved. First, the tube isn't large enough to accomodate higher quality ties that tend to have a thicker hand (e.g. Burberry), so you'll only be able to use this for your ties that are of a thin to medium thickness. Probably not a problem for most people. Second, the clip that holds the tie in place so you can wind it into the tube doesn't allow enough space to fit the tie in without a fair amount of effort. So ultimately, while this is the best product on the market, and it will work well for most business travelers, it could use a couple of improvements."
2,English given as the primary language for lyrics,"The notes are clear and easy to read, but I was very annoyed to discover that English is the primary text given in this edition (Dover Vocal Score). The English appears immediatly beneath the notes and underneath the English is the proper Italian, in italics! Crazy!"
4,Jack Costanzo -- The bongo king!,"I remember Jack Costanzo from the mid 60's, playing the hotel rooms down in the Miami Beach area (Harry's American Bar at the Americana for one). He always had a hot latin group behind him. This album blends the latin with jazz for a very enjoyable listening experience. His version (""latinized"") of Sing, Sing, Sing is probably one of the best that I've ever heard the the album is worth the price just for this cut.The percussion is, obviously, a highlight, but he's backed by first rate musicians on all cuts."
4,The real thing,"I purchased this battery to replace a Canon battery that I have been using for five years. I wanted a real Canon battery, not some generic replacement. So I was happy to find it on Amazon. The price of the battery was reasonable, but the shipping and handling charges were too high for this item. ($9.88)"
3,Branded Counterfeits?,"I opted out of taking a plugin charger on our 2 week trip to Egypt & Kenya because it wasn't clear what other baggage I'd have to have on hand to make the charger work. The alternative being to buy extra batteries for my Canon Rebel XT and the Canon Powershot. Unfortunately of the 2 Canon NB-2LH batteries I bought for the Rebel, one couldn't hold a charge to save it's soul. I sent it back and, to their credit, the vendor overnighted a replacement. That one seemed to hold a charge prior to departure. However, once down to my last and final battery with just a day and a half to go in the trip, one of the two new batteries was absolutely dead which begs the question ""did I get counterfeit batteries?"" Branded junk? The packaging certainly looked genuine as did the batteries but then again, I guess that's what good counterfeiters do. I was going to send the battery back to the vendor but I have enough stress and stuff on my plate as it is without opening another can of worms."
4,new batter,I bought 2 and they work great. It is about time to upgrade my camera. It is too bad the newer models don't use the same battery
1,Lasted just one year,"I had previously bought 'knock-off' batteries for half this price and was disappointed that they lasted just 2 years. I decided to purchase 4 of these for my Digital Rebel XTi when my generic batteries started failing to hold much of a charge. I bought 4 of these in January 2010, by April 2011 all 4 have failed.Save your money and buy generic batteries, the Canon branded batteries are no better, and in my experience are worse. The 3 year old generic battery holds half its charge, all 4 Canon batteries will either no longer charge at all or will only charge enough to light the 'ON' LED for 3 seconds before failing.You do not always get what you pay for."
4,best price found,"When our Rebel XT Digital SLR camera stopped working only after 13 months, we thought it would have to be repaired. But while searching online, people said that it could be the battery. We were shocked (not really) to see how expensive it was to purchase a new one...until I went to Amazon.com and found the Canon NB-2LH rechargeable one on their site."
5,Good deal,This battery is a good value for the money. Don't waste your money on the cheaper knock offs.
3,Good not Great,"If you use AI focus along with an IS lens a lot make sure you buy about 4 of these if you plan to shoot for more than a few hours in a day without recharging. I can get about 1,000 pictures out of two when used with the Rebel XT and battery grip when I am not using AI focus. But with AI activated I have been left without any juice on several occasions. That is why I ordered two more of these, to make sure I can get 3-4 hours of AI focus shooting without having to recharge."
3,Why is it?,"Why is it that hotdogs comes in a pack of 12, yet the buns come in a pack of 10?Why is it that a camera manufactuer would design a camera that records onto 60 minute tapes, but comes with a battery that dies after 45 minutes of recording?"
4,Good for my use,It is great for the family pictures I take on my S90. but when it dies it takes forever to get a flash.
1,response from seller,"Immediately after ordering this item I realized I had ordered the wrong battery for the model of Canon Rebel I have. I refused the item at the post office, advised the seller of the problem, but my account has not been credited for the purchase amount of the item."
1,Not the right one for the Canon Rebel Xt Digital camera,"I just purchased this battery and it's not fit my Canon Rebel XT Digital camera, it's smaller size battery, so there's no nothing good to say at this moment!!!"
5,Canon battery,"This isn't so much about the battery because it does what it is supposed to do, but more about the seller. This was a VERY fast turn around for delivery, and the pricing was better than at Dell or Canon directly. So thank you for the great saving. As for the battery its self, it is small, compact and seems to be good for several hundred pictures even with flash. The recharge time is quick and convenient. Definitely worth the purchase."
4,battery,"I purchased this battery for my Elura 80 camcorder. Previously, my camcorder was not functioning, I was told, because it needed a new battery. Once I purchased the battery, the camera worked wonderfully for a few uses. Currently, it has returned to being unable to function. Presumably, the problem is with the camera, not the battery."
4,hrp,The battery worked very well. It retained its charge for a very long time. I was able to take very many photos.
5,full power,Good battery...I have tried the generics to no avail...pay a little more for reliability when you need it.
5,completely neccesary if you own a Rebel XTi,"The battery came just fine, with a protector base to store the battery (in a clean place such as the backpack). I would say that if I wouldnt have got this battery I would have been in trouble more than once since Rebel XTi dryes them fast with its big LCD. However, Im not sure that they would last too long on other cameras since I havent tried it."
5,Great battery life,I find Canon batteries work very well. I also do not mind not using AA - an extra NB-2LH is small and easy to carry around - easier than several AA (rechargable or not).
5,always have a spare battery,Great batteries straight from Canon that are made in Japan. They come in Canon packaging work great and never had a problem. Always have a couple of freshly charged batteries with you on a shoot. There is nothing worse than taking great pictures and you run out of power.
2,If it is to good to be true.....it probably is!,The product is listed as a Canon battery. It is NOT a Canon but a cheap knockoff. It took for ever to arrive because it came from Singapore!
2,Used Battery... New Price!,The canon battery I recieved was well used (NOT NEW) and I paid a NEW Price for it. Battery was scratched and was repackaged.
1,canon battery pack,Does not hold a charge...I have to recharge battery before each camera use. Would not order again from Amazon.
1,Save your money and buy an OEM battery.,I have gotten better results with Sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price...like less the $15 shipped.
1,wrong battery,"Amazon advertised the wrong battery as a spare for the canon d30 that I bought, so I am now stuck with a useless battery"
4,"Gets the job done, no problems with it so far","although a little more expensive than some of the non canon batteries, it's worked as expected and was considerably cheaper at Amazon than at many other places I looked"
4,Long lasting,This battery provided over 16 hrs of continuous shooting with a Digital Rebel XT using the built in flash approx. 75% of time. Recharging is quick too - about 1 hr when battery is fully discharged. This was a good buy - I have 2 of them.
5,Never Powerless,Thanks to Amazon I was able to add this battery to my order. Now when I take my EOS Rebel XT with me on trips I never have to worry about having to wait to recharge my battery. I just swap them out and keep on shooting. So glad that Amazon made it affordable for me to add it to my purchase. Now I am the photographer that is always ready and never left powerless.
5,Canon for Canon,"Can't go wrong when you purchase the original battery. All my cameras have been Canon and the only time I purchased a battery that was not Canon was the only time I ended up throwing the battery away, would not even last half a day."
3,Not that long lasting,This is not a very long lasting battery especially when you take a lot of long exposure shots.
1,WARNING!!!!!!!!!!! Potential COUNTERFEIT!!!!!!!,"This is not just a bad/cheap battery! It is a COUNTERFEIT! (or at least the one I received in November of 2010 is).My G9 has stopped working and the people repairing it have told us that this battery is to blame.It sends too much power through the camera and makes the cameras circuit board swell, eventually ruining it.My next step will be to contact Amazon in the hopes of preventing other people from ruining their cameras."
1,Counterfeit reported by multiple forums,"I went for it because of the high amazon reviews, but BEWARE, the battery is referenced as a FAKE across multiple forums see website [...]. There's a clear difference between this battery compared to my original both from the outlook and the performance. For the outlook refer to the website I gave you. For the performance: I've used this battery for 6 months. It performs very poorly compared to my original battery (which is already 5 years old). My old battery can take ~500 shots w/o flash before it runs out even after 5 years old, while the battery sold by amazon dies after ~250 shots. Please BEWARE. For 250 shots, it's definately not performing as an original Canon battery should."
5,Works great,This is the type of item that is essential if you use your camera regularly. The first time that your main battery runs out of juice and you are far from home you will thank yourself for you forsight.At this time the battery works fine and I thought the price was reasonable given the price of batteries these days. If anything changes I will update this review.
4,Don't mess around with off-brands,"I've tried batteries from no-names, and they always stop working after a few months. Maxell did once make replacement batteries of this type and I bought them because of the brand-name (and price). They worked well, but they don't sell them anymore. Now I needed a replacement for the original battery that came with my camera but I really don't have any other choice. Pricey, but works reliably as it should. You can't really doubt batteries made in Japan."
2,Disappointed with short life!,"I spent the extra money for the Canon name brand because I wanted a long-lasting battery pack. Well, I've had this one less than 6 months and it only holds a third of the charge that my ""generic"" one holds! I was surprised, I thought for sure the short-life battery was the old generic (which I've had for almost 2 years) but no, it's the Canon-branded one! I guess you don't always get what you pay for; I think I'll buy 2 more generics and see if my luck holds with those."
5,"Good quality, price is right.","Used it a few times when the original battery ran out. Seemed to be at the same capacity as the original one, both with and without flash. I think 2 batteries is better than a battery grip -- not as bulky. Well, maybe because I have small hands."
1,Without the book it is uselss,"I do not have the book, but i do have the video and I can say it is USELESS! It is so bad that i have to assume that it is suppose to come with the book even though am not sure. Horrible DVD."
4,Zyliss food chopper purchased from Amazon,"I had used a Zyliss food chopper purchased from Pampered Chef for many years. When one of the blades bent, I decided to look for another. The model has changed, but the chopper is still good. It comes apart for cleaning and is easily reassembled."
4,Veery good chopper.,"The chopper is very good in chopping any veggie. Carroys are a little tougher because thay aqre harder. Cut into large pieces first. Cut onions in half. It is a little harder to clean than I thought, byt very effective."
2,No thanks,"Tried it out and sent it back. Too hard for my little sweetie to slap over, and over, and over. She handed it back to me and picked up her ginsu knife..."
1,Yes - Truly Chinese Crap,"As another reviewer says, this device is imported chinese crap. It has all the qualites of a good chopper but it cannot chop. That is, tomatoes, cilantro, green onions.The simple reason is the sharpless of the blades for out-of-the-box product. My estimation is no sharper than the average butter knife. So the blade simply bounces off cilantro and the other vegetables. More precisely, the blade impacts the vegies in a way similar to a mallot. What is left is a glob of mashed vegetables and nothing chopped.Somewhat 'fortunately' for me, I bought two thinking that I would cycle them through the dishwasher. So at least I can return one."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This food chopper is a piece of junk. My old Zyliss expired after years of hard use. I have found out that new is not always better. The blades on this chopper are dull and do not rotate in a fashion that gives even chopping. The chopping is sloppy best. Usually left are large pieces that I have to use a knife to finish the job this chopper does not chop. I repeat--DO NOT BUY. This item has NO pro's at all. You will be wasting your money. I will be purchasing a new one from Pampered Chef and gladly throwing this junk in the trash. If I could have rated it zero stars, I would have."
2,"Blades stopped rotating, bottom cover falls off easily","After awhile the blades stopped rotating on the down cut , which means I have to shake the container around. The fitted rubber bottom cover falls off easy, which is annoying."
3,small quantity chopper,"I bought this cuz it came apart for ez cleaning. My mom had a z-blade chopper like this (veg-a-matic?) and I loved it but the cleaning was an issue. This is great in that respect. Also comes with a bowl you can chop into with a lid. There are measurements on the chop bottom but I've never used these. Maybe some day. Cons are small capacity - 1/2 cup of something is ideal - more should be done in batches else you will have a hard time pushing down because the zblade rotates with each push. Not sure if this is an issue with all - but mine comes apart a bit too easily. I need to hold the 2 white parts together while chopping else the thing comes apart. Other than that, for a chopper, z-blades are great. very uniform chopping unlike my mini food processor. If it didnt fall apart so easily, I would rate 5-stars. I use this often but paid less."
3,Zyliss food chopper,"I bought the food chopper to help me and to assist in my kitchen duties at home! I make a lot of salads..so, the chopper was suppose to be an aid to cutting salad veggies! It is the only chopper I have used so I will be very candid..it isn't the ""perfect tool""!! I haven't found it to be as practical as I wanted,..but it does a ""reasonable job"" with helping to mince and refine small quantities of veggies! I'm use to using knives that I keep sharp..but the blade used in this chopper is really not the kind of quality I want..it's very mediocre!! Maybe time will tell..but, I'm old fashion and I'm use to using good cutting tools! On a scale of 10..I rate this chopper at a 4 or 5! I'm probably not the right guy to be giving a review on food choppers..but as a kitchen tool..this chopper is just average!"
2,Not a good chopper,I found that it did not chop as well as a chopper purchased at a local grocery store.
3,Easy Chop Food Chopper,"It's easy to get carried away by the insatiable desire to facilitate our daily life by buying ""smart"" gizmos like this chopper.Sure it works as intended but if you consider its small chopping capacity, the need to dismantle in order to remove larger food pieces it cannot deal with, the hassle of cleaning and to reassembly ....then you'd better buy a sharp knife and cut up everything in no time as grandma did once.My kitchen is littered with the dead bodies of other ""smart"" and attractive tools.[...]"
1,Old-style Zyliss is much better.,"I have an older Zyliss chopper that I love, but it's starting to get a little dull after several years of use. The NEW Zyliss does not chop as well as my old one. The NEW Zyliss has too many parts and is too difficult to disassemble. The LOCK sticks and is almost impossible to release. My old Zyliss is easy to take apart and clean because the blades flip open. I'm going to return the NEW Zyliss and recommend to Zyliss that they go back to the old design."
2,Save up to purchase a Pampered Chef Food Chopper instead!,"I've been a HUGE Pampered Chef Food Chopper fan and used mine for years until it finally wore out. I was excited to try out the Zyliss food chopper because the features seemed really amazing! Unfortunately, I am very disappointed because I was expecting something better than Pampered Chef but the Zyliss didn't even come close. (The blades won't chop a tomato, a green pepper, or even ham chunks. My next food chopper purchase will certainly be Pampered Chef."
5,Great product! Easy to use and clean!,I bought this for my mom and she started using it during the traditional candy making in my family. Well-- her sisters loved it. They wanted one too. Since this chopper has the rotating motion while chopping it does wonders on nuts and hard candies. It will chop them to a fine mist if you don't stop. It also comes with an extra storage cup. And with the smart base you can either chop on the table or use the flexible base or use the extra plastic cup.
3,Mechanical problem,"I have ordered and used two and of these Zyliss Choppers within the past three years. Until experiencing the problem, the product worked well with almost daily use, especially when chopping garlic. The second one jammed on a downward thrust today...just as the first one did about a year ago. This time I have ordered a different chopper with a pulling mechanism."
2,It's ok,Any food chopper isn't that great. They all work the same and this isn't any different. It will chop some foods and others it won't. Make sure you don't want much chopped cuz it doesn't chop much. If I had it to do over again I would just buy a sharp knife. This is a waste of time and money.
4,Zylis Easy Chop review.,The Zylis Easy Chop is easy to use and also easy to clean. The one fault is the directions that come with this item are poor. Although it was not difficult to figure out. I would recommend this item for anyone who needed to chop food items quickly.
2,Falsely Advertised,The product picture and text indicate these are VARTA batteries that are made in Germany. The seller sent me a battery MADE IN CHINA and branded as a Vinnic.I am uncertain about the quality or life of these batteries because I have not yet used them.Shipment was very quick.I gave this 2 stars because I did not receive what I ordered. I will update this review as I have a chance to use the batteries and am able to determine their quality and life.
4,"""Marshall Law"", pun intended!","Yes, these fellows paved the way for what became known as heavy metal, before the term exixted. I had the lp for many years, along with their first. Yes, each track is killer, if you like this style. It totals only about 30 minutes, which is too short in my view. According to a newsclip I found before the release of Outsideinside, it was partially recorded outside on pier 57 in New York City because they were so loud no studio could accomodate them. The pics accompanying the article showed both Leigh Stevens and Dick Peterson with their rows of 12 Marshall amps lined up on the pier for the sessions. That was certainly an oddity in 1968.I am not trying to encourage anyone to obtain this lp, but I just thought you would find this review an interesting bit of history. The band was known for heavy drug use, which would explain the bizarre lyrics in some of the tunes."
3,OK toy at best,"Bad at flying (doesn't fly straight) and if you're dog is a gnawer... do NOT leave it alone for a second. This thing was ripped in half within 15 minutes of giving it to him. I was still unpacking the rest of the toys that shipped with it & before i finished... he had sufficiently killed this thing. Also, probly would not stand up to any sort of wind. IT's a cloth-like middle with a woven plastic edge. Doesn't sound very sturdy... and isn't sturdy at all in reality. a waste of a few bucks.maybe more appropriate for a mild-mannered 10 lb toy poodle but certainly not good for any dog with a playful attitude and full grown teeth."
4,"Excellent ressistance, great flight","If your dog is a tough guy or girl, this is the way to go.It's washable, ressistant and has a very reasonable fliyng performance, besides compared with plastic made flyers, this one preserves its form a little better.It's form and texture make it an ""easy-to-pick-up-from-the-ground"" dog toy. So if your dog doesn't catch the frisbee in the air, you won't have to go all the way and pick it up.Remember this is a ""playing"" toy, not a ""chewing"" toy."
1,Dog toy a flop,Quite disappointed in the Flying Calf Dog Toy. I have a Doberman who completely destroyed her first one but it was twice the diameter. There is no size description on your website so I naturally assumed it was the same toy but when I opened the box - what a joke! It should have had the measurement.
4,Durable dog toy,"Sadly I never successfully taught my mini schnauzer how to catch this frisbee, but that's my fault not the frisbee's. This bamboo frisbee kind of turned into a fetch toy and chew toy and has held up really well during time. I wouldn't recommend it for tough chewers or anything, but it's held up well to occasional chewing."
5,The best of a wonderful series...,"All three Williamson ""Tales alive!"" books are great but of the three this is my favourite. The stories chosen are delightful and cover a range of sky related themes, eg. the sun, moon, stars, weather. The stories were not always the best known from a region (I noticed this with the Polynesian entry as that's my part of the world), and this was a definite plus for me. The activities are great - I work with slightly older children than the book is aimed at but could easily adapt them to suit."
4,Tales of a Shimmering Sky,A good source for teachers to find stories about the myths and legends of the constellations.
2,OK in a pinch situation,These scissors work OK but are not consistent. They were a little tight causing my fingers to get sore opening and closing them. They cut ok till I got close to the pivot screw. Just average.
4,A Great Read,I enjoyed how Waller Newell worked in a great appreciation of classical literature but with up to date engaging style.
4,Krister Henriksson,Usually watch the Krister Henriksson Wallender so very pleased this was as good. Really enjoyed this younger version of Wallender
3,Good show...average to low quality pic.,Not HD. Non-anamorphic. That about says it all. If you like Wallander you'll enjoy the story. Pic quality is low though. Not worth the money.
3,Fair,"There are so many ""Wallender's"" out there I get them mixed up. This was the English version. Well, this was one of the English versions. I actually prefer the Swedish Wallender most of all. It was ok, but after seeing the other Wallenders, I was spoiled."
4,Worked out great...,"This coat is more a trench coat than a traditional duster, but it works just fine, looks reasonably like leather, and wasn't coming apart or anything while it was being used.I bought this for my daughter, who went as a detective for Halloween, and she liked it. She is going to use it later for a female Harry Dresden costume later on, so it works out fine. We bought the larger one, despite my daughter being quite petite, for its extra length and so it was from Amazon. =) The oversized coat worked fine and wasn't really all that wide through the shoulders so it fit her fine but gave her more overall volume, which suited her fine, as she didn't want anything real tight.As a whole, I'd say I'm pretty happy with the purchase."
4,surprisingly good quality,"I modified this coat for a guy who needed a costume more Repo Man: The Genetic Opera. I was pleasantly surprised by the fabric weight vs. the cost. I expected very cheap, very destructible and I got so much more than that. Very affordable and it took all the rivets and straps like a dream. I might have to get one for myself. It's no wonder the men's coats were all sold out when I looked. Luckily the women's coat wasn't that womanly. ^_^"
3,Meh.,"If you're looking for a real duster, don't skimp by getting this. The proportions are all wrong, and while it does fit in the shoulders, the waist is skewed if you attempt to button it. With about three hours of alterations this may work, but in the end it will have taken more time than it would have to actually do it right with a real duster. Oh well."
5,True and accurate to the facts!!!,"It has been years since I have read this book. But, it was one of the most accurate in details. In fact, the only changes by the author were the names of the family members. I lived in St. Louis at the time and was friends with one of Julia's relatives.I know the details, and Ms Harris was right on!!!"
3,"Good book for beginners to Access, but not advanced users","The book serves as a solid reference for beginners to Access or relational databases, but anyone looking for more advanced topics, such as VBA or package-and-deploy should find another source. I do agree with the previous reviewer that more ""hand on"" examples would have been great."
1,Not what I thought,"I thought I was getting K-cups. Instead, I received packets of hot chocolate. I could have bought that at any local grocery store."
1,"FALSE DESCRIPTION DON""T BUY NOT K-CUPS!!!","Don't buy from this seller, as they mislead you by having a false description, the hot chocolate is merely packets and not K-Cups. You can buy the Ghirardelli packets many places for less."
5,B-24 Nose Art Directory,"A must for B-24 Buffs! Wally has expanded his format to include data on AF Wings and their component bomb groups for most of the USAAF. His B17 Nose Art Directory was concerned with the 8th, 15th, and 20th AFs. And rather than searching the total list for group aircraft he has listed the a/c assigned to each group by group number. Definitely a source book for important data (names, serial numbers, photo availability) on this aircraft."
4,4 stars for jeopardy 100 stars for the gong show with chuck barris,this show was ok but my favorite is the gong show with chuck barris. i have 400 episodes that i recoreded off of game show network years ago. i paused out the commercials while i recorded them. these tapes are very very very clear but i want the dvd quality. so please release my favorite show on dvd.thank you
3,"OK story, though a bit of a disappointment","I have to disagree somewhat with the other reviewers, in that Voyager was a great show for the first few seasons until they watered down all the characters and made the show about Seven and her tight uniform (though Jeri Ryan did an admirable job with the one-dimensional part they gave her). I at least thought that Christine Golden made some attempt to return to the original strengths of some of the characters, though the B'Elanna storyline seemed ""stuck in"" and not a part of the plot.All in all, an OK read -- though I would have liked to have seen more excitement. Ms. Golden also treated the Voyager crew much as Paramount and the Star Trek franchise sent in out -- with a whimper. The continuation of the story in ""The Farther Shore"" is better."
3,"A good read, but a little repetitive...","This is a great book, don't get me wrong... I think the author originally planned to make this a two book series. I actually found myself skipping about ten pages... I have read this, and The Farther Shore, and while the main story is fantastic, side stories are a bit annoying. The only one I found entertaining was the Holographic Revolution side story. Numerous references to the TV series seem like filler that's not important to the story. Also, while I know book series' do leave cliffhangers at the end, I mean WHAT THE HECK! The ending to part one was just terrible! That's TOO big of a cliffhanger! Even if you are a hardcore Voyager fan, you will know this book could have been better. It's a great idea, Christie, but it didn't hit the mark..."
2,Expected no better,"I usually avoid Voyager novels written by Christie Golden, but the subject of this two parter was just too tempting. Knowing that at the start, I was pleasantly surprised by Christie Golden's beginning of Homecoming. However, the surprise did not last long. Eventually, Golden's approach to telling Homecoming (racing from scene to scene without developing ""a need to know"") became predictable and unsatisfying. Above all else, Golden never anchored her novel to what matters most of all: the main characters. In other words, Janeway, Chakotay, Harry, Doc, Torres, Tom, Seven, and Tuvok hardly come alive. Truism: the plot matters little, if the characters do not matter. I liked the book enough so that someday I might just read part two. In the positive column: the Annika/Irene Hansen relationship made for a fun read."
2,Disappointed...,This woman had a marvelous oppertunity because the storyline was left so open and it read like a personal fanfic. You could tell where she desperately had to fill in what she didn't know with elements she probably collected from her personal life. I read half way through to give it a chance and I threw it down.Character spoke out of character from time to time. She rushed in a chance to clean up loose threads in all the characters I feel are attempts to try to satisfy all the needs of the fans because the show ended so abruptly. Somethings are best left untold that's part of a good story. And she kept going back to Torres and that baby. I felt like I was reading the authors personal attachment to this character because she's a mother or something.
3,Some of my favorite Star Trek Characters Return,"""Homecoming"" by Christie Golden is the first post-Star Trek Voyager book to released. This book picks right up after the events in ""Endgame."" While I enjoyed the begiinging of the book, ""Homecoming"" quickly turn in the The Doctor/Seven of Nine/Janeway book. I have admit that when this happen that I began to lose interest. Ms. Golden only spent two or three chapters on Voyager's return and then brought up Holograms rights and the Borg. I would have been more interested on the crew was doing on being home for the first time in seven years. Also, Ms. Golden missed a great chance to tie up the storylines on of minor characters that fates were never know to the viewers/readers. Would I read the second book in the series? Most likely, but I may wait it hit the used bookstore."
4,It's about time,"The series finale left too many questions, this book starts to answer many of them. For all the JCers out there, the best news is that the mismatched romance between Chakotay and Seven of Nine came to an end early in the book. For those who thought the end of the Borg was too easy, you will love the plot twist.Some questions about the fate's of our favorites have started to be answered, but the second book is a necessary read to find all the answers. This is a fast paced read and very enjoyable for all those who miss Voyager. A good start to the series follow-up books."
3,An interesting read.,"I have never read a Star Trek book before, but I am a big fan of the Voyager TV series, so I decided to read Homecoming and its conclusion, The Farther Shore. The TV series ended rather abruptly and I wanted see what happened to the Voyager crew after they got back to the Alpha Quadrant. For the most part I enjoyed both books (should have been combined into one book), but I do think that the Borg and holographic rights storylines have been done to death during the TV series. I would have preferred to see more on how the Voyager crew adjusted to being back home and to explore the relationships with their families and friends. The ending of The Farther Shore was a bit rushed, however, and could have been wrapped up better.All in all, an interesting read for Voyager fans."
4,Voyager's Homecoming,"I throughly enjoyed this book. As a Voyager fan, I was disappointed about how the season ended. I wanted to know what happened to my favorite characters once they got back to Earth. Now I know.This book contains two interesting main plots as well as a lot of interesting sub-plots. The two main plots are a Borg threat (but not in the sense that a Star Trek fan would think of) and a holographic revolution brought on by the Doctor's holonovel.I liked this book because it keeps one guessing until the very end. Just when one thinks that every plot in the story has been revealed, another twist to the novel is revealed. This goes on right up to the final chapters.I reccomend this book to any Star Trek: Voyager fan or any Star Trek fan for that matter."
1,Threadbare,"I'm only 100 pages into ""Homecoming"" and I've come to the sad conclusion that it's a children's book. If this is Pocket Books' relaunch for ""Voyager,"" it's stalled on the pad.Christie Golden's text is insipid. She never delves too intimately into the characters' thoughts, feelings and actions. Descriptions of the various mileau are bare-bones. It's a carcass with nothing edible.Several storylines are wrapped up surprisingly quickly, and it's too bad. Many fans were disappointed with how the TV episode of ""Endgame"" concluded. They wanted to know ""what happened next"" to their favorite characters. Unfortunately, even 100 pages into ""Homecoming,"" it's less than satisfying. I was surprised by how ""quick and dirty"" everything was. It was like a ""Voyager"" episode trying to sneak past a previously established plot point just to tell another story.Well, on second thought, maybe this ""relaunch"" is right on track after all ..."
2,"A large serving of cheese, anyone?","I think Ms. Golden just wanted everyone to know that she's seen every Voyager episode. So much refering to past events got in the way of developing plot and dialoge. And one page of with one character, then jumping to somebody else for a page was destracting. The story has a lot of potential but it fizzled. I was more than a little disapointed."
2,Had potential. Expected a lot better from a veteran ST author.,"The book started off great. I was immediately satisfied that the author was wise enough to kill off the Seven-Chakotay relationship. But that's about it for the whole story.The story becomes absurd very, very quickly, and reads more like a soap opera draft script than the usual quality of ST literature.As i'm a rabid ST fan, I can't give this book a 1, but it was close."
1,How many pages?,"I am a major Star Trek fan, particulary Voyager. It has only been a few months since I saw the last episode from which this book was written. I awaited paitienly for my book to come, only to find that about ten pages cut out! It was spread over a few chapters, but I will never know everything that has happened. Be very careful when you order a used book. Very unfair."
4,Great Prelude,"If you are looking for action, like an episode, this isn't really it. But it is a very good story and a thorough set up for the next book. Lots of reunions and family interaction. Love, humor, disapointment, and politics. We meet Tom's parents, BElanna's father, Seven's aunt, Chakotay's sister, Tuvok's wife and son, Harry's girlfriend Libby etc...Can't wait for The Farther Shore. Wish I could say more, but I hate spoilers, so I won't do them to you! Read the book now and stand in line to wait for The Farther Shore!"
2,To Be Continued...?,"Shades of Rick Berman, I paid for a whole book, not a part 1 that leaves me hanging like the first installment of a 2-part Star Trek episode. Regarding the content, I found the story line incongruous with the TV series regarding the attitude of Starfleet to the Voyager crew. I found it difficult to believe the events of book were plausible.I was not a great far of Voyager when it was airing but have rediscovered it on Netflix and now can't get enough of it. I was hoping for a satisfying epilogue to the series finale, ""Endgame"", which I found to be one of the best episodes contained in any of the ST series franchises. My only complaint was the rather abrupt ending that I had hoped this book would resolve. So far, not so. I will buy part 2 to see what happens to the crew. Hopefully there will be some resolution of the characters lives."
3,Good Prelude,"This is the prelude to the real story. This book is okay, but it is clearly the setup for the following one. The conclusion is very good. You need to get both."
4,What happened to Dave & Tracy's story?,"This book held my interest, although the line of work Kim and Tracy were in made me cringe when, thinking realistically, there were any number of ways these women could have been sued!That said, the characters were interesting enough, but I was disappointed when Dave and Tracy's relationship just dropped off the pages. Other than Tracy's random appearances, she and Dave were nowhere to be found. I guess I expected the overall story to be ""theirs"". They resurfaced near the end of the story and then only briefly, mostly in the past tense. I expected a better closure on this couple than that."
5,The Privileges of Beauty,"The novel is a refreshing look at life in San Francisco in another time. It is a book after my own heart full of raucous humor, enigmatic characters, intrigue, deceit and mystery. What more could a reader want?"
4,THE PRIVILEGES OF BEAUTY,"What a good book, a logical successor to Tales of the City and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Hiassen would have been happy to have written the book."
2,Book was incomplete and a teaser for further purchases,"Glossed over topics, didn't explain worksheets, and talks about video tapes not inculded but may be purchased. Also workbooks are not part of the package. As is the Book is dull, fragmented, and hard to read. The author failed to return calls regarding information on ordering a workbook that goes with the text apparently. The book is not worth the money or time. Maybe selling the whole package would make sense but just the book is useless."
1,Not worth it!!!,"Wow, this sounded so great, except for the price tag. Not worth it. I tried to contact the author as well as one of the reviewers many years back wrote. I asked him about a course he was teaching, and if this book would be used, and also if the course would offer any CEU credits and this was response I received:""No.""I thought, wow how incredibly polite, and how it must have taken years of training in compassion to take time out of a busy career to spend such time drafting such a kind response to someone who was an interested, and possible consumer.I had to agree also when I read the review, couldn't agree more about the book. This didn't cover enough, explain understandably, and should for this money have added a workbook. For $66, it should include a video with the author ""acting"" out a scene to demonstrate how to challenge current patterns of anger (and maybe he could model for all of us what it means to be compassionate!)"
4,DEEP,"This album is deep the beats are ill, His lyrics are crazy. There are a few really good songs and some of them are now classics. 1)shadowboxing 2)dual of the iron mic 3)b.i.b.l.emy favorite track would have to be b.i.b.l.e b/c it's like religious and in order to understand it you have to be familar with the old testament,go buy it..."
2,"the CD is in perfect shape, but the casing is another story","upon receiving the item in the mail, i was surprise to see that the album was in bad shape. the CD booklet had been thru rough times for somebody not knowing how to re-insert it back into the front casing properly. even the back cover of the casing was in terrible condition seeing how it's been spilled upon. so far the CD itself is unharmed and haven't been scratched up in any way.i know it's nip-picking on such common trivial problems but seriously, it's like somebody handed me down this album with no proper caring. i expected more with the sense of buying something that is at least in good condition. that's the last time i buy anything that deceitfully been described to be in decent shape which instead the main product within is unscathed."
5,Startling.,"It is rare that an album constructs an entire mythology and is so convincing in execution you have no choice but to believe. GZA's Liquid Swords is the end of music.Fans should also check the Double Leopards ""Halve Maen"", MF Doom, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, Sun Ra, Faust, and Rammelzee, but be warned theres nothing that compares to this album."
5,Bible for GODS!,"GZA drops more jewels then Russell Oliver, a corny Toronto jewellery dealer that advertises on late night TV. When studying your 120 lessons, this album can be your coles notes to becoming 5%. I'm not a 5%er, but the GZA has gems of knowledge for every man, woman and child on his album. 4th Chamber, is the choice cut here. RZA's verse, (the third), is by all means, the best verse in all of hip hop history. ""...the years 2002/the battles filled with the WU/6 million devils just died from the beubonic flu..."""
5,The Down South Critic from Nawleans can SUCK IT!!,This album is definitely one of the best rap records of all time. Its got great beat variety and hypnotic lyrics that keep you waiting for every next verse. Every song puts pictures in your mind like a telepathic vibe coming through your speakers. A must own for anyone that knows the true roots of hip-hop (Which whould exclude all down south rap wannabes with no lyrical skill)
5,um... hell yea,"I don't even know if kids nowadays know about this cd or even this rapper. Basically, this is the best east coast rap cd ever released. Non-commerical, so not many know about it. Listen to the samples on here. Lyrically, it crushes. The entire album is atmopsheric. It's a story. The Gza slashed up buttholes like Mexican food."
5,"Very, very good","Like Ivory Soap, 99.999% of the time an artist produces an album that rehashes their previous work and that of their colleagues. In otherwords, it's the same *stuff* different day. Not Liquid Swords. Perhaps the best rap album of the decade, this album hits hard and its quality is consistent throughout.My advice: If you enjoy ""real"" rap...BUY this album."
5,STRAIGHT CLASSIC,"THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS STRAIGHT GRIMMEY FROM PRODUCTION,BEATS AND, LYRICS. BUT, LYRICALLY IT'S JUST SIMPLY PUT GENIUS. THE THOUGHTS PROCESS TO CREATE THIS ALBUM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IS PURE DARK BEAUTIFUL HIP HOP POETRY. THERES EXCELLENT GUEST VERSES FROM FELLOW CLANS MEN WHO BROUGHT THERE A* GAME TO THIS PROJECT. STANDOUT GUEST VERSES ON THIS RECORD ARE GHOSTFACE KILLAH ON 4TH CHAMBER. METHOD MAN ON SHADOWBOXIN' RAEKWON AND GHOSTFACE ON INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS. THE PRODUCTION FROM THE RZA AND BEATS ARE INCREDIBLE. YOU CAN PLAY THE WHOLE ALBUM WITHOUT SKIPPING 1 TRACK. PUT LIQUID SWORDS ON FOR ANYONE THAT HASN'T HEARD IT AND INSTANTLY BLOWS THEM AWAY."
3,I Don't Think That it was as Good as I Had Heard it was,"I heard that this was the best Wu-Tang solo album EVER. But it just wasn't as good as I had expected. I loved the old Ninja movie clips, they were great. The album starts out with a little girl telling the story about her fathers association with the Shaolin ninjas and the song that follows, (named after the album), ""Liquid Swords"" is okay, but not amazing. That is sort of the way to describe the album, in my opinion. I think that the GZA has some good lyrics and has great guests on the album, but all the beats sound somemwhat similar. I think that the GZA is underrated for his lyrical skills, but I don't think that this album is SPECTACULAR. I would probably give it four stars if it hadn't got my hopes up. Instead, I'll give it 3 1/2 stars."
3,Tight,"This Cd is tight and the lyrics are really really FAt, but i dont really loved it, people seem to think that it's the best Wu solo, but i dont think so (well, it's just my opinion) But it's still a good album, if you love rap, you should have this album in you collection. Best song are: Liquid Swords, 4th Chambers (really good song), swordman (my favorite) but there's other really good song. So like i said, if you love Rap Music, you should have it."
5,"This review is by pl-gmi, so you gotta trust it.","This is the best album ever. Some of you will disagree, but that's 'cause you think the beats on some of the songs could have been better, but i LOVE this album, the beats, LYRICS, GZAAAAA. GZA is the illest mc to be, lyrically and the way he write his lyrics. Nothing like it. Favourite joint would be the title-track Liquid Swords, then comes others like Shadowboxin, Investigative Reports, Killah Hills 10304, the whole album. Definatly a CLASSIC.-gmi"
5,the pure genius of this gives you a reason to wake up.,"it's june,1999 and i'm still listning to liquid swords every day. rza's production is unbelievable. he creates atmospheres with beats. the wordplay is unparalleled. every vocal is raw as hell.method man is unbelievable here. even more then on his own album. when they talk about underground music-this is it. like everything good about the sex pistols, public enemy and pantera rolled into one, but slowed down, so it gets under your skin real good. if you dont own this-you ain't livin'. that's it"
5,This is sick...,"This album is not for people that enjoy lil john,nelly,chingy,t.i.,g unit, or who thinks mtv is the greatest thing in the world & if you do like that garbage ? This album is not for you thats why some people may be like this boring or whatever. No, you just dont do not understand true lirycist or true underground hip-hop...This is true underground hip hop with the best beats and lirycs i've ever heard and its even for me ? Better then 36 chambers which 36 is my fav album but im sry this albums tops it. Listing to the dark, grimy, raw, lay back feeling and even out shines mobb deep's the infamous, nas's illmatic... Its better then those classic albums. Dont agree ? Just listing to it this over & over. Genius's ""liquid swords"" is pure hip hop and sadly his other albums after this one ? Was pretty terrible."
5,"IF U DONT LIKE THIS ALBUM, YOU DONT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ""TRUE"" HIP HOP!","I STILL LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM TO THIS DAY...LIQUID SWORDS IS ONE THE GREATEST LYRICAL ALBUMS THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE! I MISS THE DAYS WHEN HIP HOP WAS ABOUT LYRICS AND RHYMES, I HATE THIS BS THEY GOT OUT NOW..IF U DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM IN YOUR COLLECTION, YOU NEED TO GRAB IT!"
5,FLAWLESS,I'll keep this short. This album is the only thing created in the history of man without flaws. This is the Alpha and Omega of hip hop. Anyone leaving anything less than a 5 star review should be investigated by the FBI. You have to be a complete loony toon to think other wise and I that makes me uncomfortable as a human to allow myself and my children out in a world where anyone like that exist in public.
5,THE DOWNSOUTH CRITIC IS A DUMMY,the only reason you don't like GZA is because you cannot understand him which would make you a dummy. it is not GZA's fault that his lyrics are too complex for your little brain so why don't you just be quiet!!
5,"Liquid Swords is ""liquidly and gaseously penetrative""",Two words: Immortally Legendary!NO HIP-HOP FAN SHOULD BE CAUGHT WITHOUT THIS ALBUM.IT'S MANDATORY TO HAVE IT.TIMELESS.
5,Liquid Swords,"this album is of course one of the best wu-tang solo albums ever, this album and ONLY BUILT FOR CUBAN LINX are both amazing and wortha five star rating."
4,Spellbound Lover doll,"I am disappointed that they chose to use a material that feels like plastic to make the dress. I wish they would stop being so cheap and use better-quality fabric. Other than that, the doll seems very beautiful-attractive facial paint, lovely long hair, and pretty dress style."
5,Excellent for uncertain teen daughters,"I love all the Tortall books. When I'm able to pry them out of my 14-year-old daughters hands and read them myself, I easily see why she's nuts about them. The heroines are girls, beating the boys at their games, taking up life on their own terms and helping my daughter's self-confidence along the way. Thank you, Ms. Pierce!"
4,"A great book, but needs a new ending!!!","This is a great book, but the ending was totally left off! I turned the page in the end of the book, only to find it blank, I was expecting more! Anyways, this is a good book, I won't talk about what it's about since you get the picture from other reviews. Don't expect any great fights though, although Aly has the Sight with magic from her father and mother, so there is some magic included. You've gotta read this book if you're a Tamora Pierce fan like me!"
4,"More Tamora, please",This was my first Tamora Pierce book. It was hard to put down. My mom was shouting for me to turn out my light every night. Now I have to figure out which of her other books I should read next.
1,very boring,"This book bored me to death. Aliane seems a bit stuck up in my opinion. Also, Tamora Pierce wrote her to be perfect at just about everything she does. Aliane's character seems way too unrealistic for my taste; I like to be able to relate somewhat to the characters, personally. plus it feels sort of rushed, and at the same time very slow paced. Nothing much exciting happens during most of the book; it's just about how perfectly Aliane came figure things out to protect the Balitang family. AND nothing ever seems to phase Aly; not even when she's taken and sold as a slave. She's just all ""Oh it's no big deal, I'll just get away once I'm sold 'cause im so smart."" Seriously, that's how she acts most of the time. This book is no where near as good as Tamora's last books. Lucky for me I only checked the book out from the library; I'd suggest that if you're interested in this book that you do the same."
1,Inferior to earlier stuff,"I was very disappointed in this book. It bored me and I could not even finish it. The whole idea rang false with me. The main character never gets upset about ANYTHING! She is sold into slavery, beaten etc. and she just laughs through the whole ordeal. Basically, I could not connect with any of the characters and found them all very flat and unsatisfying. Pass on this one and read The Lioness Quartet--still Pierce's best in my opinion."
2,What can I say....,"I have been an avid fan of Tamora Pierce since I was nine years old. I have read all of her works, but as time as gone by I have noticed a disintegration in the quality of her work. Trickster's Choice is a prime example of this. Not only is the story, and its sequel, predictable and bland, Pierce has sucked out all possible interest in this particular time period of Tortall. All in all this was a particularly weak show by a very talented author. However, Tamora has redeemed herself with her newest novel Terrier (Beka Cooper)."
5,woahhhh,"this book was as fantastic as tamora pierces many other books. as soon as I heard it was out, I ran to the nearest bookstore to buy it. I love her books because they deal with maturity, and have strong female roles. this book deseres five stars!"
4,Tamora Pierce is good,"So, basiclly, i love Tamora Pierce. Long and short of it. Love Tortall, and would give anything to be Alanna, or Daine, or Kel. Simple as pie.Naturally, I rush to get my hands on Trickster's Choice, hyperventilate, and begin to read. I am stuck in my room for three and a half hours with sheer happiness in my mind, gobbling and savoring the book.Personally, I thought that Trickster's choice was a bit more confusing (therefor, not as good) as previous Tortall books. The whole history of the Copper Isles (Raka and luagin) was confusing, and the beginning was a bit rushed to get to Aly betting with the Kyprioth. Since it was Tamora Pierce, i loved it, but personally I think it needed a bit more editing to be as good as it had the potentional to be."
4,A wonderful book,"I have enjoyed virtually all of Tamora Pierce's book and had high expectations for this one. I was not disappointed. This is a solid book that follows a girl as is typical of Pierce. One complaint I have of Pierce is that her books are almost always centered on a very driven girl who overcomes all odds to achieve her dream. In Trickster's Choice she deviates from this pattern. Ali is an easy-going girl who doesn't have her life figured out and is mainly concerned with her happiness today. I found this wonderfully refreshing as I was beginning to get tired of the driven girl storyline.One complaint I had about this book is that it takes a little to get going. Much of the book is used setting up the background for the action that occurs late in the book and in the second book. Other than this very minor flaw I though the book was excellent and, while it's not for everyone, I would recommend it to most people."
5,Not Enough,We just can't get enough of Tamora Pierce. Thank you for sending the book so quickly. I would definitely use your services again. Thanks.
5,exceptional,"Tamora pierce has been my favorite author since I read her first book Alanna, I have loved each and every one of the books of hers that I have read, and I believe that I own them all, but I could be wrong. I was really excited when I found out that there was a book coming out about Alanna's daughter, I waited and waited for it to come out in hard back, (normally I get paperback books, but for one of Tamora Pierces, I made an exception) I was amazed when I got the book for christmas, and I read it that very night. It was a book that was able to lift me off of my feet and pull me right into it's pages as if I was the shadow of Aly herself, following her around, and even feeling some of the things that she had felt. That's how great it was! I loved how it was a book that was hard to predict, something that would keep me reading to the very end. I cant wait until the second book about Aly comes out! Yay, another book about Aly!!!"
4,review of trickster's choice,"The book is about this girl named Alianne.She wants to be aspy like her dad, but her mom doesn't want her to follow thesteps of her dad because she said that her dad is unique.This book is really interesting because it talks about thisgirl that talked to godesses, she made deals with them and shefollowed her dreams. She had many adventures and we can seethat she did what her dreams told her to do.I would recommend this book to those people who like storieswith a lot of adventure and imagination, it's reallyinteresting and fun book!!!!!!"
2,Where's the action?,"This book doesn't have enough action! Often during the book Aly lets people do the fighting for her. For the daughter of the Lioness, I would have thought that she would have had more spunk. I love action stories and this wasn't one. Aly is such a girly-girl! She dies her hair BLUE for godness sake! I'm not interested in spys, I'm interested in fighters! She needs to get a life!"
5,My choice,"As a kid I've always loved reading about sci-fi/fantasy genres and by far this is one of my favorite books. In Trickster's Choice, Tamora Pierce invites the reader to Tortall and captivates the reader's interest by describing the adventures of Aly. Pierce deffinitely has a unique style in writing that is outstanding and they way she illustrates her storyline through writing is truly enchanting. I also love how she hinted a bit of romance in the plot as well, which in my opinion added an extra spice to her storyline. I would definitely enjoy reading this book over again."
5,Great book for Teenagers,"As a Children's Librarian, I highly recommend this book for teenagers. There are lots of issues that kids today can relate to in the character's live. For them it's a ""blanket"" when things aren't going right."
3,"Disappointing, a bit above okay at best","I was very disappointed with this new addition to Tamora Pierce's fantasy world of Tortall. There is much less action...MUCH less. I became bored with a lot of parts in this book. Also, the politics revolving around the new lands and their luarins and raka are confusing at first and there are many minor characters that are hard to keep track of in the begining too. The main character (a strong heroine of course) is very likeable, and all the characters are very believable. I just wish that the story was as good as it's characters. It's not that I hated this book, but I wouldn't recommend it, not when there are many other great books out there. If you haven't read a Tamora Pierce book yet, read a different one, like the first ones: The Lioness Quartet.This book was about 3.5 out of 5, okay, but nowhere near as good as the others."
3,Not Tamoras Best,"I am a big fan of Tamora, reading Alanna, and Daines stories were just really great, but if you expect this to be the same, well don't. The book was good, it had a good ending, climax and small romance,Aly was an unforgetabble heroine, really quick smart, and witty, but it was just too slow! Nothing happend for like 100 pages. I found myself dreading it and just wishing for it to end, because it was a good story, and I wanted to find out how it ended! But Tamora could have taken away couple of pages, and unimportant things, that weren't even interesting to read. I do recommend this book if you just insist on reading it, enjoy a lot of fantasies, but I warn you, you might be disapointed like I was."
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!,THIS BOOK IS THA BEST SO ALL OF YOU THINGS OUT THERE RATE IT A 5 STAR OR BE DISINTEGRATED!!!! I JUST LUV THIS BOOK SO JUST SHADDAP AND READ IT PROPERLY!!
4,Good,"I am a Tamora Pierce fan. I read all her books. So, I was extremely happy when I found that this series was coming out. I read the first one(this book) and the second one. The first one was better even though they were both good. There were likable and unlikable characters. The book was a lot like others Tamora Pierce has written. I was glad that she was writing about a spy: I was getting tired of knights and magicians. Good read, and great for re-reads."
2,Not so good,"In my opinion this was a bad piece of writing on Tamora Pierces part. In the past she has captured us with extrodinary tales that have taken writing to a whole new level, however I feel that in this book she has taken away everything that once made her books so wonderful. The plot was slow and boring, there was nothing that the character did that really captured my attention, although I like the idea of someone following George's footsteps,I thought this book could have played out much nicer. It lacked the suspense and emotion that is normally shared with one of her books. I hope that her next writing gives us a little more magic and fun than what was shown in Tricksters Choice."
2,Writtin With a Twist: A Bad One,"When I was younger, I loved Tamora Pierce. I devoured every book she wrote with an innocent intensity only characteristic of children anymore, but now that I have matured more, I read this book, expecting it to be fabulous like the others. I was wrong. Not only was I wrong that this one was not fabulous, but I was also wrong about all the others being fabulous. Tamora Pierce is excellent with plot, but her writing falls a little short of the mark. While I was young, I had no judging eye for well-written books and what young children really like is just something that keeps me captivated. The problem is, now when I read the books, every sentence falls flat with a groan of agony. This book is not good. Now if all of you just think I am an annoying adult, it's not true. I'm talking about realizing this now, and I am thirteen years old. If a thirteen year old can recognize bad writing, shouldn't you be able to?"
2,Not Yet Completed This Book.,"I am so bored by this book; it is just so hard for me to pick it up. I have read other books by Tamora Pierce, ok only the Alanna series, but I thought that series was really amazing. When I saw this one and found out that it was Alanna's daughter I was so excited. I started reading to a pretty good conflict. Then I am completely bored by the constant dragging on about the story. I keep hoping something exciting is going to happen but it doesn't seem to ever happen. I guess it's your choice if you want to get this book or not. Looking at the other reviews I see a lot of them really liked the book. In my opinion it was one of the worst I have ever read so far."
1,Disappointing Entry,"I found this a very disappointing entry in the Tortall series. The early intervention of the gods robs the book of any tension because we already know how it's generally going to come out. Aly herself is a rather flat character; she just walks through the book without much of anything to challenge or endanger her. I also found it very hard to believe that George would teach her spying skills when she was a child--certainly not without Alanna saying something about it. The ending just seemed to ... stop, without any real resolution. If I get the sequel, I'll wait until it comes out in paperback."
3,Disapointed,"I was so excited to read this, the newest of the Tortall books, so it was really disappointing to find it so mediocre. One thing I've learned to look forward to with Tamora Pierce is that her books always have some fun action in them, and the heroine gets to use her unique skills to do something impressive. This book had absolutely no action in it worth writing about, and Aly's ""skills"" were never put to any interesting or exciting use. I frankly didn't find the political intrigue that much fun, in part because it was hard to keep all the names separate in my head. Pierce has her god as much as promises that the next one will be more exciting, so I hope it lives up to that promise. As for this one, I wouldn't be buying it in hardback if I new then what I know now."
5,Wheeee...What a READ!,"Its been a while since I revisited the part of the bookstore that holds Tamora Pierce's books. I have to say I am glad I went there. This is the first time since I was seven (and read the Lord of the Rings trillogy) that I have had a crush on a fictional character...but hey thats what makes fiction fun. I cannot wait to read the next one. I just ordered it online so it should come soon. *hope*Tamora mixes her great skill at story telling with the adventures of a girl that could be any one of us. She has the same problems as any teenager rather than becoming one of the more ""super-heroy"" types of some of the earlier Tortall books. I love it when I can read a book that takes me several days and not grow bored with any aspect. I have already re-read this book twice and am beginning my third read.This is what fantasy should be. Absolutly delightful."
3,Not the best,"Here's the basic storyline. Aly, a teenager, lives in Tortall with her knight/mage mother and her father who is a spy for the king. She becomes involved in a God's plan to bring down the Lurian kings and replace them with a raka queen. Aly is placed right in the crossfire, acting as the God's interpretor.Personally, I did not think this was one of Tamora Pierce's greatest books. It was a little too predictable and there was not much action. I belive that her series ""Protector of the Small"" was quite a bit better. However, this book did have some well-developed characters and many details."
4,A New Beginning for Aly and Tortall,"Trickster's Choice is another sucess for Tamora Pierce. Aly is a strong character who uses her brains more than brawn. Aly with the help of both magic and friends is able to accomplish the challanges she is presented with.Tricksters Choice continues on the tradition of ""sheros"" and is just as enjoyable as the predecessors."
5,Wow!,It's the little things that can derail a teacher's day. This book is packed with ideas to try in your classroom. If one idea doesn't work for you there are lots more to try. This is the greatest resource I have come across in 10 years!
5,EXCELLENT!,"Not only is this a very helpful book, I was able to purchase it because of the reasonable price. I was very pleased with the high quality of the book's condition, and the quick delivery from Amazon. I will use your service any time I want to purchase a book. Thank you!"
2,ankle sleeve xl,I didn't like the brace because it was very hard to put on there was no give to this product.
4,Great book for jazz students,"Most educators will tell you that there is no ""one great book"" for delving into a given subject area. While this is also the case here, this book as well as David's advanced ear training book should be in every jazz musicians library. This is especially useful for the beginning student in helping he or she to identify vertical sonorites i.e. chord/scale relationships, call and response patterns and numerous conceptual applications to strengthen the student's ear. This book may be out of print as I have been told of difficulties experienced in attempting to purchase it. Make sure that the tapes or CDs come with the book. Highly recommended!"
5,Great buy!,"I love this product! It's very, very soft and the deep color can last for a long time. It's been a few months since I first used the product, and I haven't experienced any stain on my hand as another reviewer has suggested. I would highly recommend it!"
1,color came off and spoiled my leather steering wheel,"I was very happy with it initially but when I removed it after couple of months , i noticed that my leather steering wheel was spoiled with the cover's internal color (dark blue). i tried to clean my steering wheel but color did not come off from it.not a very good quality. may be you need wash it once before using ."
2,"too small, doesn't fit!","I've bought many sheepskin steering wheel covers in various price ranges and qualities, and this is the first one that didn't fit! How can it not fit? They don't come in sizes! It's a nice quality, and maybe it's just a defective one, but I'm not reordering."
2,poor packaging..,"bought this item had to pay alot for packaging,they put it in big box cost me about 40 us dollas in packaging,really upset...."
3,Not the ideal but okay regarding to the low price.,One star off for its flipping material.Another star off for it does not have enough grip on the steering wheel.
4,Been wanting another,"I've beeen looking for one to replace my old one. I loved it, and have not been able to buy one reasonably priced. It keeps your hands (steering wheel) warm in winter and cool in summer.It works just as well as my other one did, and the color matches perfectly with my car's interior."
2,Not a smooth feel...,After using this product for 2 days I had to take it off. The underlying stitching was rather sharp and bumpy and you could feel it every 5 inches around the diameter. Found a suede type cover from an auto store that is much more comfortable.
5,I love it!,"I was worried the color would be too silver, but its definitely a nice dark gray. It matches perfectly to my dark car interior, its soft, very plush, and is nice & tight on the steering wheel.Perfect for keeping the steering wheel comfortable in the hot summer and cold winter!"
