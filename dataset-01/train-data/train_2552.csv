1,The Joy Diet: 10 Practices for a Happier Life,Was veryy upset this item was on cassette tape. I was looking at CD's and this was brought up as something I might Like and I was interested and ordered. Unfortunately have not been able to listen to. Need to find cassette player. No a reflection of the item but a reflection of offering other items not in same listening category.
4,The Best Diet Ever :),"I love Martha Beck's writing. She has such a simple yet intelligent voice. She also knocks me out with her humor. I love the moments when she places an incongruent word in a group that will just make you stop, pause and then laugh at the placement. (For example-not from the book-I love read novels, non-fiction, and the confused look on my teenager's face when I am talking about the 60's).This book is a delight and really gives some great tips and great quotes to take away. I am especially going to use her actual to phrases about eating:1-You must eat only what you enjoy eating2-You must enjoy everything you eat.(that means eat the candy bar instead of the brocolli but stop when full).The whole book is about finding your real self and not masking it with food (my issue) or excuses. A delightful read."
1,SV221MICRO,"Device did not support the mouse scroll wheel on any of 4 mice on hand. I contacted the manufacturer who stated that it does support the mouse wheel function. They replaced it with a new unit at no cost (very good service). It did not work either. They claim it only supports basic mouse functions. A two button Microsoft IntelliMouse is a basic mouse at this point. They stated that since the new unit works the same the device is performing properly. I would have to try another mouse (not so good support). What a joke. I returned it and purchased a D-Link KVM-121, which works great and includes switched audio. The D-Link unit demonstrated that the Startech unit really is a piece of junk. I got to pay shipping both ways (and maybe restocking fees too) to find that out. Lucky me. Its hard to blame the seller. It is not their product, but the unit does not work within reasonable expectations."
1,Cheap,"Cheap materials, cheap construction, won't hold up. The hooks come separately so you have to assemble them. Easy enough, except the plastic is so cheap it breaks once you insert the metal hook."
5,Awesome.......,Just received yesterday the hangers and was specifically looking for travel hangers. These are awesome!!!!!!! They bend to pack easily and can be bent to be utilize the hangings of different types of clothing......
4,Nice Product,"Purchased as a gift since a family member's leather jacket kept developing hanger bumps. The thick design prevents bumps on sweaters and jackets. The bendable contour is useful, however may just be unnecessary complexity. Could be improved if instead of shipping ruler-straight it was preshaped with an ideal curve; minus 1 star to have to carefully shape product yourself before using."
1,Don't bother,"Nice idea but terrible product.The hangers flip when you try to hang anything on them.If the hanger attachment was more stable, perhapsthey wouldn't flip. I tossed these and purchased thenon slip hangers instead."
4,Does the job. No more bumps!,"I bought a set after getting tired of those embarrassing bumps you get from hanging your sweaters. These did the job.The only complaint is that it will be difficult to keep you garment on the hanger after it is bent. They become too narrow to actually support some garment from the shoulder if they have a wide neck opening or button downs. I wear medium - large sized sweaters from Banana Republic, Abercrombie, and Polo to give you some comparison. Its really not that big of a problem but someone with larger size might have a bit more issues than I would when hanging their sweaters. It would be great if its wider.Edit: Disregard the part about the size. They have bigger sized hangers you can buy."
2,Not the best version.,"This translation is not as readable as the book ""You Converted Me"" a modernized translation by Robert J. Edmonson,CJ I felt like I had to translate this myself as I read it."
5,Good 7-string starter book,"The title fits the content: ""Introducing 7-String Guitar"". This provided exactly what I was looking for, heavy metal/rock and jazz 7-string. What a contrast in styles but those are the most common applications for a 7-string. The book provides chords, scales, tunings, voicings and the CD has 66 solid examples of both styles of music. It contains examples of jazz progressions with a walking bass line (my favorite part). There are plenty of rock/heavy metal examples. Also, in the rock/heavy metal section, there was a clean pleasant arpeggio style picking example utilizing the 7th string. Overall there are plenty of usable examples, clear and easy to understand.I feel this book is for the intermediate to advanced 6-string guitarist who is brand new to the 7-string.I have to rate this book highly because it was perfect for my current skill level and I play both music styles. If you are new to 7-string, get the book."
1,Misguiding`,"I found this book poor, to say the least.The author spends the majority of the book talking and demonstrating ""power chords"". Please. How difficult are those? root - fith. You can find them anywhere on the fretboard! Save your money and look for another method."
4,A method for the 7 String guitar,This book is a method book as opposed to a reference book. There are many examples in many different styles. It's a book aimed probably for the early intermediate guitarist. It should show more of the dissonant Korn/Fear Factory style. I'm guessing from some of the examples that this guy leans more towards progressive bands like Dream Theater. It includes a CD and audio examples always help.
2,Sticky factory sealed dvds,I bought this new & the episodes kept frezzing up & skipping with no scratches to be seen i thought i saw something on the discs so i took it back & got another set & disc 1 was sticky & dirty & disc 2 had some stuff on it also. For a factory sealed product someone there sure doesnt have any respect for the consumers.
2,Disappointing,The episodes selected for this compilation were chosen merely for shock value. They were not the most entertaining or funny episodes.
1,Edited for TV versions,"I've never bought any South Park DVDs--between Comedy Central and syndication it's on several times a day in my market--but I always thought they'd be unedited, along the lines of the South Park movie. But the episodes on this collection are edited in exactly the same way as the TV broadcasts. A real disappointment."
2,This Compilation makes me want to steal these episodes on-line from now on.,First they put out all of these tapes and dvds with scattered episodes with no rhyme or reason. Then they finally get it right and start doing it season by season. Now they are going back to the smattering of various episodes with the chance to own the gay Tom Cruise episode earlier and the pilot. I have to agree with the critics on here... I am a fan but I think it's time for them to start releasing the seasons faster rather than give us these redundant compilations.
2,"great episodes, weak commentaries","I loved just about every episode on this set it felt like it really did encompass whaty make south park great. of cource i felt trapped in the closet was only here because of the brew-haha it created. i would have liked to see the earlier seasons honored.biggest gripe would have to be the commentaries they were 4-5 mins they felt really tacked on and i know ive heard that Trey and Matt hate doing commentaries but it felt like they really phoned these in just so they could brag that all the episodes have commentaries. i have heard that doing commentaries for animation can be hard as there really is no mishaps on set or ad libs but you can talk more about the concept and how it became an episode rather then ""this is a great episode because cart does something evil hehe well on to the next episode""they actually said that on some of the commentaries ""well on to the next one"""
2,Its all about the money...,"This release is just to milk the series and make more $$ for Matt and Trey and of course Comedy Central.The hardcore South Park fan already owns seasons 1-8 and there is no point of buying this (except for the Spirit of Xmas pilot) because eventually there will be Season 9, 10, 11 etc on DVD.Why couldnt Matt and Trey release the ""Spirit of Xmas"" pilot on ANY of the previous box sets? because they just want the money from South Park fans like me who want to have it all. Period.Good box set for new South Park fans but for the rest of us, this is just a basic example of re-selling episodes for money."
5,SP,"South Park is hilarious! This is a great combination of some of the best episodes! If you like South Park, but don't want to buy every season, ""The Hits"" is the way to go!"
4,Really,"I love South Park and these are some funny episodes. They are not my top ten favorites, but I guess everyone's are going to be differant. The only real reason to pick this one up is for the Jesus vs Santa Claus short that launched South Park. Other than that, it is better to pick up the season box sets."
4,This game is fun,"I will admit I am not much of a fan of the action game genre, I never really liked the shoot em ups and the fighting games. But Urban Chaos is a very well done exception It provides the player with a wide variety of things to do, between fighting a crook and trying to talk down a jumper from the roof. It takes on a lot of ideas and accomplishes them all. One downside of this game is it can be a little repetative. But this can also be a good thing, too. Another downfall is when you are fighting more than one person, this can be downright painful to endure. But through and through the game is excellently crafted and enjoyable to play."
5,"It's Strategy, Action, and Advanture all in one.","This is a great game and also very realistic. At some points of this game, I felt like I was actually on the streets of Union city kicking the bad guys's asses and arresting them for terrorizing the city. Although the story of the game is a little weak, but the graphics and the interaction with the virtual world of the game makes it a must buy."
5,Urban Chaos: TOTAL SUCCESS,"What a wonderful title for anyone looking for action. I have only played a demo but from what I played, I loved every minute of it. The graphics in this game are awesome. You just can't stop playing it for all the features. Interaction between other characters is nice. It makes it seem more interesting and realistic. Games similar to this title such as Fighting Force and Die Hard Arcade can relate to this title. I also think a good attribute of this game is the opportunity to drive around the streets of the city. Overall it is the best third-person action game I have ever seen and played. You can eexpect me to get the full version. I recomend you do the same! It kicks A$$"
2,My Least Favorite Sassy,"While this teether is colorful, it's too heavy, big, bulky, and awkward for a baby to hold when he is little enough to be teething."
1,A superficial reference work,"A comprehensive review of this book appears in the May-June 2003 issue of ""Biomedical Instrumentation and Technology"", Vol. 37, No. 3, page 223. The book is of such a brief and limited work as to make it virtually useless."
1,"Beautiful and poetic, but not terribly useful",Seol Euna's book looks lovely on your desk. It has beautiful graphics and a lovely design. It is essentially useless if you want to learn anything about Flash MX. The directions range from extremely detailed to extremely vague. The quality of the writing suggests that the editor is new to the English language. Non standard language is used throughout. There is no index to find anything. From her web sites it is clear that Ms Euna is a successful designer. She is not a successful author.
2,Better Luck Next Time,"As with the other reviewers, I really liked H&D and was looking forward to Devil's Bridge, BUT I can't even play it. The frame rate is horrible. I have a PII300mhz,a Voodo 3, 64MB of memory so I know it is not the computer. It runs H&D just fine. I called TalonSoft and they said the problem is in the game. So, if it runs this bad on my computer - Why put it on the market? When they fix it I will probably never take it out of my CD and it can't be soon enough for me."
4,Good product,I have installed it on pocket PC and laptop. Works really well. The only drawback is that I have to clear memory on pocket PC from time to time to make it work faster.
1,rehashed Gosho,"""The Major Writings of Nichiren Daishonin"" werepublished by Nichiren Shoshu International Center,and the editor-translator is the Gosho translation committee.Unfortunately, the major writings do not list specific namesof who was on that committee.So, perhaps Burton Watson was among the editor/translators,and if so,he is (perhaps) entitled to duplicate some of the goshoin ""Letters of Nichiren"". If not, ""Letters of Nichiren""is simply a plagiarized copy of the major writings,with the order of the writings changed."
1,DO. NOT. BUY.,"We have an enterprising dog that can get into any trashcan around. This can seemed sturdy, with a tight fitting locking lid and even though it's large for the avg kitchen (16 gallons!), we decided to try it. We (2 reasonably intelligent, handy people) could not get the lid to open. It ""snaps in place tightly"" - they got that right! Maybe there is a trick to it- nope- no instructions, no unlocking mechanisms- it is impossible to get the larger lid to open and the smaller inner lid is locked inside and cannot be accessed without opening the larger lid. Im not going to fight with this can everyday. So, unless you know something we dont or have masochistic tendencies- find a better trash can (atleast a functiong one!)"
4,Enjoyed it,This is a very well written book that doesn't gloss over his darker aspects such as the fact that he was a mean violent drunk who beat his girlfriends. The only parts that I didn't like were: a) Armchair psychology--I don't like it when biographers try to link how a subject behaves with some psychological theory. b) The descriptions of his art--frankly I didn't see what the authors describe. Those with an axe to grind against abstract art will find material here especially in the sections describing his last years.
4,"""Terrific""","This is your book if you want to know about Willem de Kooning. The authors have done an exhaustive amount of work delving into his art and personal life, focusing especially on the many women who had close and sometimes strange relationships with the painter. I am not convinced that worldly people of great Art will be talking about de Kooning as a master in the same breath as they will, say, Picasso one hundred years from now, but he was certainly imporant to American art over the past sixty years.While de Kooning's paintings speak for themselves, I left the book thinking that his not being in control of his use of either women or alcohol sadly diminished him."
2,Beautiful but fell apart after extremely light use.,"I bought this as a wedding handbag. It is beautiful; however, after only opening and closing it about 10 times, the metal clasp completely separated from the bag making it completely unusable. I'm very gentle with my belongings and I only had lipstick and powder inside!! Luckily I only intended to use it once and it lasted through the one picture I wanted it for, however I definitely wouldn't recommend it."
1,This game installs malware,"Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some important aspects of the game:This game secretly installs SecuROM - a particularly nasty piece of software which can cause many problems for your computer. It communicates encrypted data to remote servers, and is almost mpossible to eradicate completely from your system."
3,Not worth the money,Took me 2 days to finish this addition. I wouldn't suggest it. Good content but not enough of it!
3,Range Expation,"I like the mad looser and the wierd area in this expansion, u start with a very nice scenery and totally new monsters and ppl, everything is very different in this expansion which makes it nice. BUT the game itself is archer based. U get arrows to kill a gate keeper so if ur not good with a bow u will throw them by hand ? untill now i only got archer items and bows and nothing interesting for the shield and sword lovers. Another thing is this game crashed my pc so many times, it ruined my windows and burnt my ram so be very carefull with it. They say the new patches fixed it but i havent installed it since the accident, the game gets boring when u keep starting over so many times."
5,Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isle,Simply put....AWESOME!! : ) In some aspects even better than the first. If you liked the first or even just like roleplaying games in general pick- up this series!
4,Not just more of the same,"Shivering Isles is definitely not just more land to explore. There is a much different tone to this land. While it was not quite what I was looking for, it was fun and interesting to explore. It is definitely one of the better expansions for a game (bigger than many games out there) and certainly worth the price now that it is a little older.If a land where everyone is quite insane sounds fun to you, you'll enjoy this quite a bit."
4,Great add-on,Great add-on. Adds very enjoyable hours to Oblivion. It also has some of the weirdness missing from Oblivion that I enjoyed so much about Morrowind!
4,Hippty Hoppity!,"Neopets: 4"" White Snowbunny Petpet Plushie. This is a cute little collectible Petpet. I purchased this from amazon some years ago and my child still has it to this day. Please note, that this is a small plush about 4 inches. I would suggest that you look at a ruler and compare the size. Overall, I would recommend this product for all those petpet fans."
4,BobbleSavvy,"Upbeat, catchy, well-written pop is hard to come by. Upbeat, catchy, well-written pop sung without irony -- and with great vocal authority -- is even more rare.What we have here with AUTOMATIC FUN is a rock album that isn't ashamed to Pop its bubble, and a pop album that can most certainly rock.Like a bit of lyric bite amongst your froth? Hate the bitter aftertaste from most tormented popsters-cum-rockers? The Bobbleheads is for you -- a definite ""stay-in-your-car-CD-changer-for-months"" kind of album."
3,Not quite the color I expected,"I would describe the color as ""salmon pink"" rather than red. This went on my wife's bike, and she likes the color, so no harm done, but someone looking for red should look elsewhere."
2,Nice cover,"This is quite a nice ophthalmic photography text book, but it is not a must have. Take a look at the ""Ophthalmic Photography"" by Johny Justice and also ""Textbook od Ophthalmic Photography"" by Don Wong, I highly recommended."
2,Disappointing,"A gift for my elderly mother. Was disappointed, songs were not familiar. Not what I was looking forward to for comfort, encouragement, hope. Too much ""show"" and little substance."
4,Nice set; but not worth $57.,"I like this set. The knives are sharp and of good weight. But the small size of these knives limit their usefulness.I also do not think they are worth $57. However, you can buy the exact same set (but with a painted knife block) right now at Bed, Bath & Beyond for $20. And if you use one of their or a competitor's 20% off coupon, the set can be bought for $16. At $16, the set is well worth it."
3,Wears out very quickly!,"I received this product as a gift about 10 months ago. I was deliriously happy with them at first as they were sharp and I had no basis for comparison, but the quality of these knives diminishes very quickly. Like another reviewer, I also have found that small rust spots appeared over time, and that the edges dull fast, even when being compulsive with the suggested care. What has been most disappointing however, is the fact that there is actually a small tear on the blade of the largest knife. You will also find that the serrated knife is not actually long enough to slice across the circumference of a NY bagel.These knives are ideal for limited use, but are disappointing for a professional chef, an avid cook, or someone hoping to become adept in the kitchen. Perfect set if you think your desire to cook is just a phase."
3,Really comfortable but stains your socks,"Aerosoles have soft cushions in the shoes that make every pair comfortable to wear. I chose this pair and it certainly lived up to its name and is very comfortable to wear. I wore it for 4 days straight and my feet didn't complain a bit. This morning I sorted through my socks and realized that the white socks I wore with my new shoes were all stained rosy pink on the bottom. I have no idea if the stains would come out; if not, that's 4 pairs of socks ruined.Bottom line is: comfortable shoes without a doubt but beware of stains if you wear light colored socks."
4,Learning basic words,My son is in a school were there is an extremely large number of spanish speaking students. He kept bothering me to get him books so he could learn spanish. I purchased this book to help me label different items in our house to start the learning process. We also used this book while we were homeschooling. Great to have around for a quick reference!
1,Complete lack of support & the wrong item shipped.,You sent me the incorrect product and the tips were rusted when they arrived. I sent a message to the Amazon partner and never hear a response. This was VERY disappointing.E-
2,Not useful as a textbook,"I am a professor of linguistics, and was assigned to teach a general Corpus Linguistics course for the first time. This book was billed as a standard first textbook in the subject, suitable for uninitiated linguistics students. We have found that the book is chiefly an annotated bibliography of the field, and does not cover enough topics in sufficient depth to serve as a course textbook. I have had to supplement nearly every portion of the course with either additional readings or methodology that I provide on my own. The students find it dreadfully dry, it reads almost like a phone book, jumping lightly from one barely-treated topic to another without ever actually teaching a single thing.Unfortunately, the publisher refused my efforts to contact them to get myself an advance copy. Now I know why this happened---by letting me see the book in advance, they would likely have lost a bunch of sales."
5,"Hello... I'm a PHAROAH addict! (Hello, AnDrea...)","I bought this item on a whim one day, and I've been playing it ever since! This game will make you scream orders at your panicked armies, and shed a tear about the gold miner that was attacked and killed by robbers( well, THAT may be over-the-top). I like this game so much more that any of the Sim games because you have an immediate goal to achieve. The levels are more difficult as you progress, and you gain more control of how things work. I have not purchased any of the other games by this company, so I don't know how Pharoah stacks up to Civ III etc. However, I'd advise anyone into scenario-games to look at this one."
5,I love this game,I play this game as well and the Cleopatra expansion quite often. I love all the strategy games by Sierra. I count them among my favorites.
2,"If you have Caesar III, save your money!","This game is exactly the same as Caesar III, they have just changed the interface and graphics.If you wanna my advise, save your money for a newer game. However, if you don't have Caesar III, it will be intersting for you no doubt."
1,Bad bad bad,"I found this game dull to be honest. I love strategy games but this one isn't all that great. In-game instruction is inadequate and you'll quickly find yourself with a sprawling town that is too complicated to be of any fun and difficult to manage even on the very first level. My recommendation, try it before you buy it, in case you hate it as much as I do. Anyone wanna buy my copy?"
2,this game just isin't much fun,"After a few missions I had enough of this game. The graphics are terrible, the replay value is very low, but worst of all there are like two songs that just play over and over. The music is the most irritating thing I have ever heard. I just didn't enjoy this game much. If you like city building games then you may like this one, but if you like more hard core games then don't waste your time. If the music was better then maybe I would have liked it, but I couldn't make myself play it because it drove me nuts."
3,fun but not 2 fun,"this game is fun building the buildings and stuff like that but you cant controll your army which came to quite a shock to me becasuse i have all of the age of empires games (gold edition,age of emipires one, age of empires 2, age of emipres rise of rome, age of empires the conquers)you get the point and the real setback is you cant controll the army if you could i would give the game another try, if your an age of emipires fanthis game is not for you of course there nice buildings but 2 little battle."
5,Greatest Game,"This game is so cool. I want to become an architect and this gives me experence to building, like Sim city but this is way cooler."
2,SimCity in Ancient Egypt,"Pharaoh is a city building game (like SimCity), but set in Egypt, during the pre-dynastic period. You start by building a settlement, addressing basic needs and continue onward. Unlike SimCity, there are various goals to hit such as population goals.As the game progresses, it gets harder.Unfortunately, I found myself building and managing the population, but having to check the deities almost constantly. Unless you hold regular festivals, constantly build shrines, the gods will grow angry and exact revenge on your civilization. I found it to be more tedious than fun."
5,Thoroughly addicting. A rare gem.,"There are very, very few computer games that have ever hooked me like Pharaoh has during what's been nearly 20 years of playing them. This game is an absolute gem, and, for the ridiculously low price it sells for, it's also a steal. Pharaoh is very deep and engaging, and the fact that it's so chock full of history and was so thoroughly researched makes it shine even more. I should also say that time flies by while playing it like you wouldn't believe; I'll think a half hour has passed only to look at the clock and see it's been almost two. Which brings me to my warning: it's almost impossible to stop playing this game, though I'm quite happy to be hooked.If you like city-building games and especially if you're into ancient Egypt, definitely buy yourself a copy of Pharaoh now!"
3,Play the demo,"Does the game look great? Yes. Is it challenging? Sure. But... I found it painfully repetitive. You start out by building a city. Once you get it to prosper, you move to a new location and build another city. You may have a few more building options, but it is basically the same thing over and over. Building monuments does give a sense of accomplishment, but they do take a long time. The graphics are fun -- dancers and jugglers and thieves running around (my personal favorite are the hippos munching reeds) and the music adds nice flavor without being repetitive. But I would advise anyone interested in buying this game to play the demo (available at GamePower.com ) first. This will give you all of the Pharaoh phun you need."
4,Pharaoh,"This game is great fun for anyone interested in Geography. As well as being great fun its also educational. I used this game to help me pass my Geography exams, it taught me what people need to live and what facilities help to create a better place to live, for example good healthcare and religious facilities, as well as shops and recreational places such as bars and festivals. You can also create parks and gardens.The down side to this game is the time it takes to build monuments. It takes forever to build things such as pyramid complexes and temples. On the whole this game is a good investment, it provides hours of in-depth fun and education"
4,A Personal View from a Scientist,"Robert Hazen presents a general feeling for what it is like to be a scientist researching the origin of life. The impression one gets is that there are a lot of ideas about abiogenesis, but not much data with which to sort through these possibilities.Hazen does an good job of presenting the various hypotheses on the relevant concepts. However, he also ends up talking just as much about the personalities engaged in the research as he does talking about the ideas themselves."
4,Great book away from complexity,"The best! his first chapter Emergence and Origin of Life, following byall detailed experiments descriptions which gave me a real aproachto the most difficult mystery we confront."
3,Rambling and disconnected,"The field of abiogenesis is in desperate need of a book that would properly explain the field. This would involve describing the different hypotheses that currently exist; the evidence that stands in support of each such hypothesis; and the difficulties presented in examining the origins of life through small-scale experiments where proto-living molecules are a small signal in a sea of contaminating chemicals.This is not such a book.The rambling account follows the author as he visits different labs, superficially ruminates about some of the ideas in the field, encounters some of the difficulties involved, and deals with illness of friends. It is not boring, and it is not completely pointless - one can glean useful information from the pages, here and there. But if you are looking for a book that explains abiogenesis, this is not it. In fact, current Wikipedia page on the topic, along with its references, will get you far further."
1,Buy OEM parts when you can.,"Bought two Gabriel Ultra passenger shocks because I thought it was a good value. Upon installation a noise eminated from them when going over uneven pavement. This was confirmed by two different mechanics. Replaced with OEM units and noise disappeared. Wanted to save a buck, but ended up costing more."
3,Great texture & poorely shaped,Texture & taste was really good for a GF bread. I would give it the highest rating if not for it's shape. The slices were small & somewhat mushroomy in their shape. Looks like the bread did not rise properly before being baked so that sides collapsed . The odd shape made it impossible to make normal sandwiches or to use them in sandwich maker. My kids did not like deli meat hanging as dogs tongue on sides of their sandwiches. I would not write here if not for all 6 packs were of same poor quality. It's my second unpleasant experience with Ener-G Foods product on Amazon. Their products at grocery stores seem of much higher quality for some reason. I doubt if I will order them again in bulk.
1,Wouldn't even feed it to the squirrels,"I've only been on a gluten free diet for four months, so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid. The worst part is that Amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this. I'd put it out for the squirrels but I'm not sure they'd eat it. If you're expecting something that tastes anything like bread, you're in for a shock."
1,Not what I expected,"My daughter has autism so we are trying Gluten free diet! This bread did not help! It was almost a month out of date, it was hard and not very good! My daughter just will not eat it! Thought it was a good deal but just a waste of money."
4,Good for gluten free,"My mom has an allergy to gluton and this is her preferred bread and one of the only gluten free breads she will eat. It does not taste anything like normal bread, and she rarely eats it untoasted, but if seems to calm her bread cravings."
2,Dry and gritty,"I have to eat a gluten free diet and thought this would be great , i can have bread again. I have to admit the taste was not bad at all but the texture was gross it was dry and gritty. Was like stale bread and when you bit in to it felt like you had sand in your mouth, i couldnt stand eating it."
2,Something about this...,"I've tried eating this a few times over the years, but always seem to have an allergic reaction to it. Also, it has an odd sweet taste that is unappealing."
5,Great as supplemental reading,I am using this book as a supplemental reading in my Management 301 class. I have hardly seen anything that illustrates the principles that Kotler and Drucker talk about in their texts. I hope many of my students go out and adapt those principles in their own businesses.
1,"Beans, not my cup of tea",Not only is the appearance of the book child-like but the writing is sophomoric and the 4 principals are dummied down to an in-excusable low for a business audience.
5,Self-contained Training,"That's what they should call wonderful little books like this, because the author has basically done the trainer's job for us. The discussion questions in the back, paralleling the teaching points in each chapter, are absolutely the perfect tool for getting people in an organization talking. The fable itself is charming, but the questions and the pages from the consultant's notebook add an extra dimension that you don't often find in business books. I applaud this attempt to give managers a non-threatening way to remind employees that it's really about the Golden Rule: treat your customers like you want to be treated yourself."
5,A truly great book,"I picked this book up on a business trip and had the time to read it on the plane. I have nothing else to say other than it's wonderful and eye-opening. I thought I knew what it takes to run a proper business until I read this book.There are times when every entrepreneur wonders whether she or he has made the right move. When I read the opening chapters of this book, I realized that by opening my own business I had done the right thing. I just need 10,000 customers to agree with me!"
1,BORING,a couple is making obviously simulated lovemaking at the start of the movie. this goes on for about fifteen minutes but seems like forever. starts poorly and goes downhill from there. long long boring lovemaking sessions between long long boring pointless conversations. avoid at all cost.
5,Excellent Source of Information,"This book covers so much ground about grieving, why we feel the way we do and how to get over loss. It is comprehensive and very insightful. Tremendously helpful."
3,used book,Received this book in a timely manner. It was just as described. Pleased with the service.
3,Doesn't live up to its own billing,"I wish Dr. Rando's philosophy really was to let people grieve on their own terms, as she alleges. Unfortunately, she brings a great deal of cultural baggage to her beliefs which may not coincide with the reader's beliefs about death.It is not necessarily better to have a funeral. It is not necessarily better to have an open casket (when would it be better? Yuck). It is not necessary to feel guilt, or anger, or shock, or denial. But she implies that these are all necessary for healing.Many of the rituals she advocates are only carried out in the United States. I wonder if perhaps she realizes that many of her readers will feel alienated by her unwitting America-centrism."
1,How to Go on Living after Someone You Love Dies,"Would not suggest this book to any one. I feel it is written in a negative tone and even has some ""scare tactics"""
1,Sexist,"Very sexist writing. Somehow, the ones who die most in the examples are always men. Somehow, the men in the case studies are the ones who always give the worst advice. There's a lot about kids in this book, and somehow, the kid is always a girl (always). Don't buy this one if you're a man. If the author can't control her own sexism, how can she expect to be a compassionate and clear-sighted counsellor of any kind?"
4,Very academic book,"I have lost my mother four months ago. I was desperately looking for words of confort and also ways to understand my feelings and what I was going through. Even though I consider it an excellent book, it lacks something important for us mourners, the spiritual part. However if you are looking for a book that explains in a scientific way the feelings and emotions one can go through this is a good book. But again, it would be better to be read with another book that gives confort during such a tought time."
4,Self help book on dealing with the death of a love one.,"I lost my husband in June 2012. This book has been helpful in my understanding of what I am going throughand what I might expect to go through in the days to come. It's a confusing time and sometimes it feels likewhat I am feeling may not be ""normal"". This book and others like it help you realize it is ""normal"" and that thingsAre going to get better. I would suggest this book to anyone dealing with a loss or anyone helping someone througha loss."
5,How to go on Living When Someone you Love Dies,This book has helped me and many members of our family numerous times. It is a fabulous tool in getting through the loss of a loved one. I highly recommend it!!
5,stunned by grief,"Well written, not complicated. Choose this book for a friend in deep need. Would buy this book again and give it to someone else. There are not many books out there on this subject, which surprised me. Glad I purchased this book."
4,The Whipped Parent,This book has enpowered me and showed me that I'm not alone. It has given me tools to use to help keep my sanity.
4,The Hard Truth,"I read the book for a research paper for one of my biology classes and was very impressed with it. The writer successfully explained in layman's terms the harsh truth about STDs. I recommend it to all. Everyone needs to be aware of the world we live in and we need to know the price we can pay for the decisions we make. I live in Miami, where the sex scene is everywhere: music, the club scene, movies, the media. You need to know before the bombardment of sexhits you, so that when you make your decisions, or mistakes, you are prepared.Educational, and yet interesting."
1,Deplorable - A waste of time and money,"This game is overrated by the few who play it. If you want a more fun game check out the panzer campaigns or the moderncampaigns by hps simluations.The Operational Art of War has a terrible interface, terrible game play, even worse support.If you have XP dont waste your time or money. Incompatible."
5,Scientific based kniowledge for basis of severe mental illness,"Possessed Mentalities is not written as a sensational murder story. It is a book written for the general reader as a reference for many current political and mental health issues. It is an excellent read and reference for anyone wishing to live wisely.It is not written for those who, for whatever illogical reasons, cling to Freudian beliefs about mental illnesses."
4,I enjoyed it.,"I thought the last review was too harsh. It's been many years since I read this, and, yes, some stories are very aged and pulpy, but, in my humble opinion, should you enjoy the idea of a two volume science fiction set, ""Men hunting things"" and ""Things hunting men,"" this book delivers on that promise. I enjoyed it and kept the pair proudly on the shelf for years. Should you wish great literature, well, what the heck are you looking here for anyway? It's fun. Simply fun."
1,Better out of print,"Maybe this is suitable research material, but it is not readable. I threw away my copy and glad to be rid of it. Hope it stays definitely out of print."
3,Works pretty well,"This makes the not so fun task of cleaning of the poop somewhat more pleasant. You don't have to bend over and pick up the mess any longer. The rake which is included is relatively effective even when working with grass. However, the tines on the rake could be a bit more substantial. They do tend to bend relatively easily. Once it has been used, I don't think that you really want to work on bending the tines back into place. If you're cleaning up a poop in a deeper wet snow the rake will be almost useless, as the tines just bend back. You can use the shovel portion once frozen and scoop under for those!Took away a star from the original after several months of use, the tines are bent differently. Sounds benign, but when one of those awkward ones grabs on the ground, and it flings poo at your dress pants, you're not going to be happy."
5,Excellent service,"I purchased this pooper scooper, and made a mistake on the shipping, the company corrected this for me with no issues and saved me $$ GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE thanks!!"
5,Misting System,"Great product, great price. It is exactly what I was looking for as a home greenhouse cooling system."
4,Exactly what I needed,"This is a quality product, and it's easy to build if you've ever fixed your sprinklers. Nice, clean, professional look."
2,Dont Belive it.....Lies All Lies,"There is no way this game is better than motocross madness 2, if you allready have mcm2 dont buy this game mcm2 is like a top notch game this game is low rate its controls just bite and the graphics are mediocre. If u plan on buying a motocross game go w/ motocross madness 2 trust me u cant go wrong w/ that game."
1,what is going on??,"Another anti-atheism book that is not available being hyped on twitter, this is about the 3rd in as many days, I can assume the other people got to read it, the 5 star comment from a friend of the author and the less complimentary review from not such a good friend. I read one sentence, ""atheism leads to Satanism and Communism"" and that should tell you all you need to know, another American Right wing nut-job who still thinks Hoover had a point and Palin would have made a good President.If you agree with either of the points made in the last sentence you don't need this book, you're nutty enough and if you disagree, this book is not for you it will only wind you up."
2,Just Preaching to the Choir,"Not suprising, being as this is a book about Atheism written by a Christian, it is completely biased. The essays provided are just absurd. It's just some theologans (not socioligists or historians mind you) claiming that atheism leads to communism and satanism. I don't need to explain what's wrong with these theories, especially the latter.If your a theist and just want to spend good money on stuff your going to hear in Church anyway, feel free. But for rational thinking persons this non-book is more like an overblown Jack Chick tract than and intellectual tome."
4,Good product for the money...,"I expected this mouse to very sluggish, considering it was wireless. But to my surprise, it really wasn't. It moves through your screen very smoothly as if you were using a standard mouse. Another great addition to this mouse is that it comes with rechargable batteries and a recharger. I think it's the first wireless mouse that has this feature. This is the first wireless ANYTHING I've bought for my computer and I was very impressed. I might just look into buying a wireless keyboard to go with my mouse. Pick it up, you won't regret it."
1,Worthless,"This game is a prime example of people just wanting to make money out of a cheap product.This game is deplorable: This game is overrated by the few who play it. If you want a more fun game check out the panzer campaigns or the moderncampaigns by hps simluations.The Operational Art of War has a terrible interface, terrible game play, even worse support.If you have XP dont waste your time or money. Incompatible."
3,Useful but lacking,"This text has some important ideas that I was able to put to use in the classroom, but it unfortunately lacks the depth and creativity of some of its newer rivals. One book that I loved and highly recommend is ""Successful Classroom Management"" by Eyster and Martin, just released this summer. While ""Setting Limits"" covers one aspect of teaching well--dealing with students in the classroom-- it does not have the scope that ""Successful Classroom Management"" offers, including how to navagate relationships with your supervisor, colleagues, and especially parents. Useful, but definitely not the total package. Recommend:Successful Classroom Management: Real-World, Time-Tested Techniques for the Most Important Skill Set Every Teacher Needs"
2,More of the same.,"This book seems like a rehashing of Fred Jones' ideas. It repeats ideas from most other books on classroom management that you may have seen. I skimmed it in about an hour and got everything that I felt it had to offer. The ideas are not bad, but if you have gone through a teacher ed. program, read any other classroom management books or spent any time in the classroom at all, you have probably heard and tried these ideas. I also believe that the techniques are more appropriate to middle school level and below."
1,Never Shipped,"Seller never shipped my item, after asking item to be canceled after two weeks of not receiving a shipment notification, seller never canceled my item. Now I am having to go through Amazon customer service to get my money back, apparently even if the item hasn't shipped, amazon takes your money out, even if the shipment is never verified."
4,Useful and deep enough,"This book would be useful to anyone who teaches school, either inexperienced or after years in the classroom. It is deep enough to help teachers manage early stages and reasons for behaviors but accessible enough to actually be ""used"". This book won't sit on the shelf gathering dust."
5,The World's Ultimate Dollhouse,"When I was 7 years old, my mother, grandmother and a cousin of mine went to Chicago, and one of the places we went was the Museum of Science and Industry.Before we went, my mother told me that as a young girl, she had seen the fairy castle when it toured the country before becoming a permanent exhibit at the museum. She told me how much she loved it, and I couldn't wait to see it. I was not disappointed. This IS the ultimate dollhouse. Every time I go to the museum, you can't get me to leave without seeing the fairy castle.I took my own daughter to see it, and now she loves it, too. The last time we went, I found this wonderful book at the gift shop, and was thrilled that now I could look at my beloved fairy castle whenever I wished. This book is a real treasure, with beautiful pictures of the castle. Anyone who loves dollhouses, and the fairy castle in particular, will love this book. It never fails to provoke happy memories for me."
5,A Fantasy Come True!,"This is the most delightful book! It is so fascinating to see the detail, love and imagination (not to mention money) that went into creating this Fairy Castle Doll House. I am planning on traveling to Chicago to see it for myself (when I get enough frequent flyer miles) and I had never even heard of it before reading this book. I plan on buying several more copies to give as gifts. I am considered middle aged but this book brought back every little girl's fantasy I ever had about a fairy castle."
1,bad condition,I love this book however it arrived very soiled and smelled terrible. I had to throw away the dust cover and spray the whole thing with febreeze
5,A well-written diary,"This is a really great, well-written book about a 13-year old girl who is having difficulties in her life. The diary is wonderful, with tremendous detail. The good part is, like real diaries, that there isn't an ending--you must read other books that help you understand all the people's lives better. Maggie in the book has an eating disorder, her mother is an alchoholic and her father is trying to make her into something she's not. It's a very wonderful book that you should read. Afterwards, you might want to read Amalia, Diary 2 , because Amalia in the book talks a lot about Maggie and how she's trying to help."
4,A great book!,"I like C.D. better than the BSC, because the characters in the BSC are all goody two shoes, they never do anything bad. As the one reader said, she thought the problems were only happening to a select few teens, but I don't think thats true. Everybody has problems, and I think C.D. helps teens to work out their problems by showing how other people work out theirs. I can't wait for Maggie's next diary so I can see what happens to her."
5,Awesome Leaves you in suspense,This book is awesome it really leaves you in suspense every one should read it! You will not be able to but it down!
3,UNREALISTIC,"Maggie's problems are real-life issues and I appriciate Ms.Martin's ability to grasp the porblems that todays teens face, yet on the subject of Maggie's eating disorder; when girls have an eating disorder, it is more difficult for them to admit it and start eating more than was portrayed in this book.Maggie was like, oh, ok i have an eating disorder, ill stop now so the book can end.No ....I dont think that's the way it goes.Eating disorders are difficult to get out of, and that is part of the agony of them.I challenge you to see the truth in her struggle against her body."
5,These books are great!,California Diaries rule! Ann makes them so interesting and realistic that you can't put the book down. But BSC books aren't so bad either.
4,"A little depressing, but a good book.","California Diarys are one of my fav. book seires. This book was sad. Maggie was convinced she was fat, but it's obvious she wasn't. I hope this book tells other people not to starve yourself just because you think your fat. Her mother's alcholhal promblem was a nice sub-plot."
4,"Maggie has an eating disorder, and her Mom's a drunk.","You feel bad for her, because she had such a great life, brains and voice talent. However, since she's dieting her voice is too weak to hold a tune and she's tired and kinda blank so not doing as well in school. To tell you the truth, I'm pretty sick of so many books being about a girl being anorexic. It would have been nice if Ann focused on another problem, instead. However, there was a good ending. It was sad, but good.."
5,Awesome!,This book was really great. I think it's realistic how Maggie keeps thinking she is getting fatter. I just got the book today and read it very quickly. I can't wait till Amalia comes out!
5,Maggie Maggie !,Hey I Haven't read this one yet but i have read the other 7 i read them in like 30 mins. cause i can't put it down
2,Low Quality Toy,"The other reviews are right, this is not a quality toy. The blocks do not fit together well so the plane falls apart easily during play. It is a good thing it comes with stickers to help hold it together. I'm glad I didn't spend more and won't be buying this brand again."
1,waste of time,"this toy was made awful, missing pieces, a waste of time and not worth buying save your money they are trying to make you think you are buying a lego type product but you are not"
1,Waste Of Money,"This set was a complete waste of money. Difficult to put together, cheaply made and poor instructions. Save your money :)"
5,Family Favorite,"This book is in better condition that I had as a child. There was a name written in the front cover, but besides that you would never know that the book had been used. I still get a kick out of all of the amazing details in the pictures on each page. So happy to have a copy for the next generation of kids that grow up in our family!!"
1,Windows 98 incompatible,"Could not get the system loaded and although the add says 95/98, we called the distributor and we were told it is not compatiable with windows '98."
3,works OK but high network disconnection drop rate,"The performance is good when it is working but mine has dropped its connection quite often, about twice per day. I have another PC with a DLink DWA 552 Xtreme N Desktop adapter that has much lower network connection drop rate (about 2 per week)."
2,"It's great if you like headaches, stomach ulcers, and frustration!","Way too many issues with the wn311t. Worked okay for about 2 months on my XP computer. Then the issues started. Spent about 3 days problem solving, checking out online threads ... updating firmware/drivers, etc. All to no avail. My Netgear router is perfect. But this wireless receiver isn't worth all the headaches. I've even had some of my techie friends come over that do the networking for fortune 500 companies and they scratch their heads.Unless you like stomach ulcers, headaches and making cancer . . . I'd stay away.I never write reviews. This is my first. But I felt compelled to so that maybe I can save some poor soul some misery."
1,NetGear = Garbage,I installed this after getting pretty poor performance for the USB adapter.This thing can't hold a signal to save it's life. Right next to the PC I have a Dell Laptop with built-in wireless that never loses connection.It also often doesn't even SEE the strongest connection.I replaced this POS with a Linksys USB. It works flawlessly.

5,Perfect,Order arrived within a few days. It was exactly what we needed since these discs are increasingly hard to find in stores. Good price as well.
4,Basic Inkjet Printable Not Hub Printable,"I need to create a lot of CDs and print on them, so this definitely fits the bill. Just be aware they are NOT hub-printable. That is, the inner 4cm cannot be printed on, so you only have the outer 4cm space to print on. Otherwise they work just great."
1,arived broken,There was not enough padding in the box. Arived with a broken spindle and the discs spilled into the box.
2,shipped damaged,The cover over the spindle was busted and several of the CD's were broken.Very disappointed because the box they were shipped in was fine so they must have been packed that way.
5,No Probblem.,"Use them all the time as they just work. I Don't mess with any others,and the price is good.A"
3,shipping & packing,We like the CDs but didn't like the way it was shipped. It didn't have any packing and the spindle on both CDs was broken and it ruined about 14 or 15 CDs. Better packing when shipped will be greatly appreciated. I will be reordering them an a couple of months.
3,Nasa UFO's,"Definitely a low budget production which has been transferred straight from the video release is one of the worst transfers I've come across on dvd so far. Considering it was made in 2000, you would think the transfer would be decent, obviously not. When Martin Stubbs is being interviewed, the colors dont look right and very grainy picture. Cheap cameras have been used to film this documentary. Some of the nasa clips downloaded by Martin to video via satellite who has recorded every mission since the early nineties is of low quality. Dont expect the original nasa footage, this is vhs quality that is 2nd or 3rd generation copy. Besides all the technical issues, this is one of the most interesting ufo documentaries of all time, there is a lot of proof here that something strange and unusual is going on in orbit and Nasa dont want us to know. Running time 90 minutes, no extras, plain menu screen, audio pcm stereo.Disc 3/5Transfer 1/5Audio 3/5Extras 0/5"
1,UFO Zealots Amongst Us~~,"I would use the ""twilight zone"" theme song to start off this blog but, sadly it isn't even worth the effort. I find it more than humurous how some folks can't take a couple of minutes to look at the other theory or theories relating to this so called Proof of an ""Un-Known"" lifeform floating around our planet. The 1st rule of the Gub-Ments policy on aliens- ala project Grudge and Blue-book=""If they really are ""alien"" life-forms or space-craft of some kind caught on NASA footage, do you really think for one minute, no make that one second that we/us-YOU would be watching it?...... in other words, if that footage was genuine in any way, the lid would have been slammed on it a long time ago, don't get me wrong this isn't feeding into some ""cover-up"" nonsense, it's just well.....perfect sense, don't let your emotions or belief systems get into the way of the obvious.the that's all folks"
2,Great Title,"Because the book had such a great title and a high amazon rating I bought and read this book. I was not impressed. We learn in the first 10 pages that the Minotaur is introspective, detached and emotionaly vacant, but over the next 300 pages this point is made again and again. I was looking for a little more of an internal discussion about immortality."
4,Chill out,"I'm not a big English-writing-jargon-blahblahblah kind of guy, so statements like, ""the over characterization of the mid-plot, doesn't even fit in with his standard style of the Victorian age."" Whatever. I'm here to say that if you are looking for a fun book that is quick to read, buy this book. I liked it a lot. It made me smile. And I hate smiling."
4,A book to keep,"I confess, I bought this book based on its catchy title and intriguing cover art. I wanted something entertaining to read on vacation, and it looked like it fit the bill. For this little effort, I was richly rewarded by a novel that opens an entire world of fantasy existing in the context of stark, southern trailer-trash reality.The minotaur is both a victim and hero, horrible yet lovable, a mythic being living in a trailer park, driving a Vega station wagon. He sees the world through ancient eyes and struggles to fit in. He is not always successful, but he knows right from wrong, and with effort, modifies his behavior to be acceptable. Seeing the world from his perspective is thought-provoking. This imaginative story is a powerful vehicle for introspection.So now, there is this connundrum: I loved the book and I want to pass it along so others can read it, but I can't bear to part with it. It's that kind of book."
4,"Entertaining to read, but left something to be desired","I have to agree that this book's story line was weak in places. Many things do not get resolved and are brought up only once. It's difficult to pinpoint a major theme or symbol. Something will be reoccurring for a few chapters, and then disappear for the rest of the book. Despite of this, the book was enjoyable to read, and l would recommend it simply because of the humorous subject."
3,"Very briefly, a bit of a disappointment","I was fascinated by the premise of this novel but felt that it wasted many opportunities, passing over what struck me as fascinating narrative sidelines (the other survivors of the mythological world who cross the Minotaur's path) with an odd incuriosity. Sherrill does a fine job of building a vivid picture of the world in which the Minotaur lives - it's just a pity that what happens in it isn't terribly interesting. In a similar vein (mythological beings living in the modern world) I preferred Neil Gaiman's American Gods, which is less of a literary novel but considerably more sympathetic and entertaining."
5,"I laughed, I cried, I reconsidered my career choices.","I don't read a lot of YA (and I'm not sure thats what this is, although its probably could be) however this little book was too good to pass up. If you or someone you know was a fan of Greek Mythology as a kid, this is a must read. And, even if you know nothing of mythology and are in the market for a existential thinker, this is still the book for you."
2,it is not a durable one,"Half year ago I bought two of the dimmers for my bed room, last week one of them did not work that completely a unusable one now. Only last half year of work, so it is really a non durable item! It seems a quality problem. Another problem is a buzz can be heard at nights if you put this one on the night table in your bed room, even though the slider is easy to use."
1,Nearly caught on fire!,"Worked for a couple months and then started to flicker, but usually worked ok so long as it was all the way on. Until today when I smelt smoke and it was hot to the touch. Opened it up and it was melting the plastic inside. Shudder to think what would have happened if I wasn't home."
5,Love It!,"I actually have two torch style lamps hooked to the same switch, and it works great! the lamps are always at the same brightness It also hides quite well in my entertainment center with the help of a piece of double stick tape. My torch lamps will never get knocked over again!!"
4,Does the job well and as advertised,"I bought 3 of these for nightstand lamps at home. Note these have a disclaimer saying they are only for incandescent bulbs, so discard this if you are going to be using low-consumption (fluorescent type) bulbs (the ones that come with the electronic starter). The item works fine. The construction is good enough (4 little round rubber adhesive pads it has on the base seem to come off easier than anticipated). The cable is quite sturdy. Installation is quick and easy (I can't gardly call it ""installation""... just plug the thing into the outlet!). As indicated in other reviews, don't excpect micrometer adjustment capabilities, but I do think it is sensitive enough to allow for low level, dim lighting conditions... it just takes a little practice to know where to find the sweet spot, but I think it is good for my needs and I would purchase again."
1,Terrible,I thought this cord would be the solution to my problems.Instead what I got is a dimmer that adjusts itself whenever it feels like.
2,Caused buzzing noise,"Bought this item today, will return it.Switch is built well and sliding mechanism felt great.However, once plugged in, it caused my bulb to start buzzing even though slider is at full ON position. The noise went away at OFF position. I removed this device and the buzzing went away.I planned to use this as on-off switch only, since my bulb is regular CFL (not dimmable). The desk lamp is not reachable from my bed, and I hate getting up to turn off the light when I am about to fall asleep. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that this model dimmer is for incandescent/halogen bulb. I will try their other product Lutron TTCL-100H. Hopefully that one will not caused buzzing noise."
5,Table lamp dimmer switch,Great quality for the money. Exceeded my expectations.I have bought their products(Lutron) in the past and have always been satisfied.
3,"for installing, which position of the slider is the ""on"" position?","I've got three people staring at this thing. It must be installed with the dimmer slide in the ""on"" position. But nothing in the instructions indicates whether ""on"" is close to or far from the LED light! Any feedback would be appreciated."
1,Works but is flaky in quality.,"I bought two of these. Within two weeks, one of them stopped working completely. The other one works fine, except sometimes it will lose its luminance setting and you have to mess with the slider to get it to ""wake up"" again. Honestly, the shoddy quality is not worth the price of the product. I would recommend instead getting a cheap ""in-socket"" dimmer. Those are a lot more reasonable in price, and much more sturdy in the long run."
1,JUNK,Lasted long enough to not be sent back. JUNK. These are garbage. Will not be buying LUTRON. LUTRON GARBAGE LUTRON BAD LUtRON NO GOOD
1,Doesn't do what it is supposed to,From the other reviews I may have received a defective model. It didn't dim the light. It just caused it to flicker. Even at full off the light would still blink. It also emitted a constant buzzing sound when plugged in. Thankfully Amazon took it back.
2,its okay,"This does not work with CFL bulbs, only incandescent bulbs. If used with a CFL, then it flickers like a strobe like and makes a scary sound."
2,Disappointed,"This doesn't seem to work with cfl lightbulbs, and I decided not to go back to the environmentally unfriendly bulbs just to have a dimmer. It would have been great in the nursery, so I am disappointed and will return them. The cord wasn't long enough for our situation either, but most houses have more plugs that ours does. Oh well."
1,Disappointed,"If I was able to give this no stars, I would. Its one of those items that you buy, and ends up going straight to the trash can. It simply did not work at all. I tried it on 4 different lamps and it had the same effect on them all: loud buzzing noise and a flickering light (like you would see in a scary movie).. Zero dimming effect. Bummer :/"
1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONE MONTH,"Worked great at first, gave out this morning and it's done. I had it ONE MONTH. Very disappointed because when it worked, it was great. I bought a second one, thinking the first was a lemon.....it broke in about a month, too. THESE ARE GARBAGE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,DOA on arrival,"Most reviews are positive, but mine came defective and I'm sending it back to Amazon for refund. Might have been an isolated case."
5,Works great !,This dimmer was just what I was looking for. I use it in my china cabinet and it works perfectly. Tried another brand that didn't work at all. So I am very pleased with this product.
5,works so well,"perfect, exactly as described - makes it so much easier to not have a bright light shine in the middle of the night"
5,great product,This is a great little dimmer..Hooked right into my light and made it so easy for me to access the on off or dim to my liking...cord is a nice lenght so it reaches my table top.
5,"Great item - durable, useful, good price.","I've had one of these in service for about 2 years, on my nightstand, which gets A LOT of use (I'm somewhat bed-bound, AND sensitive to light) ... I adjust the brightness often and every day-- it still works and looks like new - good product!For me, the LED (perfect brightness) on it, which is 'on' when the dimmer is off, is VERY, VERY helpful--in the dark, and it's not *too* bright (perfect) -- needless to say, at bedside it is instantly found (without glasses even!) --- and a little trick that I do to keep track of my glasses, is: keep a case right by the dimmer button w/LED on the night-stand, and they also are instantly easy-to-find in the dark 8-)"
3,not the best not the worst,"it does the job, i live in an apartment so i cant re-work the outlets and install light switches so this product is an easy fix for that. it does buzz a little when turned on, nothing that is noticed when people are talking but if its quiet you can hear it. does the job for cheap"
4,Works great for a year or two...,"We use this dimmer in our bedroom and in our son's room and it works perfectly to adjust the light to different levels for reading, sleeping and activity. The only problem is that both of our dimmers got glitchy after a year or two and one kind of sticks and the other (in my toddler's room)would go out while I was reading him bedtime stories and make him upset. We ordered a replacement and it is working well. The new little red light they attached to the base is a great new addition as it makes finding it easier in a dark room."
4,to settle the question...,This does work with the hitachi magic wand.Thank god. Worth every penny.We've only used it a few times though.
4,Excellent desktop dimmer,Bought 2 of these to control floor lights that were just out of easy reach to control. The dimmers work excellent and look perfect. Each dimmer has a very small red night light that only comes on when the lamp is completely off to help locate the dimmer control in the dark. Sliding the dimmer is easy to do and does vary the lighting amount. An excellent product.
2,NOT for fluorescent lights!,"I've used this model before with incandescent lights and been very satisfied. However, I just bought another for a fluorescent light and it is not made for them. The packaging specifically says it is not for fluorescent lighting, but it does not mention that in the Amazon product description.Technically, the fluorescent light does go on, but the dimmer makes a god-awful amount of buzzing, and the light sputters to life when it is turned up - I doubt that is good for the bulb. Rather than risk a fire, I'm just putting the dimmer away until I can find another use for it.For CFL/LED lighting use this model:Lutron TTCL-100H-WH Credenza Dimmable CFL/LED Dimmer, WhiteI researched the manufacturer's website and found information that confirms this model does not support fluorescents. I requested the info on this page be updated by Amazon."
4,Works ok overall,"This sliding dimmer approach is okay if you're using it for a ZOOMED terrarium heating pad. Once you get it set right, it's the slightest of movements that does the trick for a couple degrees."
4,Great Concept,"These dimmers work great! Would have given it 5 stars if a longer cord was an option. They have a 6' cord and really could have used an 8 or 10' to work from my bedside. Had to rig up an on/off switch cord to it, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars plus!"
1,Died after less than 1 week,For some reason the item just died on me after using less than 1 week. The led red light indicating that item is live and plugged in is on but the light doesn't turn on when plugged in and certainly doesn't dim up or down. i returned for money back
3,Dimmers work,"Product seems to work just fine, I purchased 5 of these to adjust the heat output on my Lava Lite collection... So far they work just fine, but I can't seem to shake the idea that I am losing some brightness when they're turned all the way up."
4,Great for newborns,"Like other reviewers, I was looking for a dimmer to use with a lamp in our nursery while up all hours of the night with a new baby. This works perfectly. The dimmer plug DOES stick out from the wall a couple inches, because the lamp plugs into the back of it. Mine is under a table, so not a big deal, but it wouldn't work well, say, behind a bookshelf. Also, it does make a very quiet buzzing sound when dimmed. When the light is on all the way, and when it is completely off, there is no sound. It's very quiet and I don't notice it until I go to turn the light off and the buzz disappears. It's not very noticable, but it is there.When trying out lamps to use with this dimmer, I discovered the buzzing from a dimmed CFL bulb is incredibly loud, so I am using a lamp with an incandescent bulb. CFL bulbs don't dim well and make a lot of noise."
5,Awesome for Brass Table lamps!,If you own any expensive big brass table lamps you know that the acid in your sweat and oil of your hands corrode the brass (leaves dark or green marks over years). NEVER touch your lamps again! They won't tarnish from handling now! I bought 3 for all of my expensive lamps! The dimmer is an extra feature!
4,I need more of these,I didn't even know these existed until I ran across one in the store. It does create a very slight hum at lower settings which I can barely hear just two feet away away. I can see how handy this would be in the bedroom. I like it!
2,"Awesome, until it stopped working","I loved the dimmer, and it worked great on a swag chandelier hanging above my dining table. Unfortunately, within a month, the dimmer broke (the little light doesn't turn on, and there is no dimming functionality). Luckily, even though I was out of the return window, Amazon is replacing the product for me. I hope that the second one I get is more durable."
5,zombird,"I attached this to the lamp in my room, and clicked my lamp to the second setting (bright). Now with this thing I have an awesome dimmer lamp that really sets the ambiance to my room. My lamp is now adjustable from bright to super dim. The construction of the device is great, and the rubber feet stop it from sliding off of the dresser next to my bed. If you want to impress a girl with your light dimming abilities, then this is the device for you."
5,Works well,"Bought this for a table lamp on the other side of a dresser from my bed. Works well, the dimmer needs to be turned up to halfway before you can set it to minimum luminosity, but that's understandable considering the power needed to start up the filaments in a standard bulb."
3,not bad,"when this low intensity, it turns off after a while.Very easy to install and use.In general terms, satisfied ...!!!"
5,Lamp DimmerThis dimmer is the best of many i have tried.,A great and easy to operate dimmer. Built-in light helps locate dimmer in the dark. Lutron products have been around a long time and have a good reputation. Highly recommended.Al
5,An inspiring perspective on Alzheimers,"""Journey by Heart"" is a short, but fascinating, account of the work being done at Alzheimer's Services of the East Bay, a center that works with adults who have Alzheimers. Rather than presenting the disease as a frightening tragedy, it shows how people in the right environment can still lead dignified and happy lives. The people at the center are loving and creative, and there's a genuine affection for the lucky men and women who come to this place. One hopes that this film is shown everywhere as an example of what can be accomplished to help both those with Alzheimers and their caregivers."
3,"Nice piece, thinner than I thought","This is a nice piece for a woman. If buying for a man, probably not, as it is rather thin.But, nice quality..although a bit easy to bend."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this and it was cheap, bendy, and should be a prize in a bubble gum machine. Don't purchase!"
1,NO STARS,These chips tasted like cardboard. They were absolutely horrible. After taking one bite I immediately put the case out to the curb for the trash man.
3,alittle disappointed,The chips aren't as flavorful as I remembered when from buying them in a health food store. I was hoping that the ranch flavor would be more pronounced. I'm not sure if I'll get these again.
4,Braddock book,The writing was somewhat dry but the overall story was outstanding and Hague made no effort to downplay or inflate the facts.
3,Cool while it lasted,"This is a good frisbee. It flies well. The led was very cool for about 10 minutes until it fell apart and wouldn't turn on anymore. It hit the side of a tent and fell into pieces. It still flew though and provided entertainment, but I was dissapointed at how fragile it was."
3,LIGHTED UP FRISBEE REVIEW,THIS ORDER WAS OK BUT I WAS LOOKING AT THE PICTURE & I THOUGHT IT CAME AS A SET OF 3 OR 4 LIGHTED SMALLER FRISBEE DISC SO WHEN IT CAME IN IT WAS JUST A REGULAR SIZED FRISBEE BUT IT HAS A LIGHT ON EACH SIDE UNDERNEATH THE FRISBEE & THERES A KNOB IN THE MIDDLE UNDERNEATH OF THE FRISBEE THAT YOU TURN ON TO MAKE THE LIGHTS COME ON. IT DOES LOOK VERY NEAT AT NIGHT FOR NIGHT FRISBEE PLAYING. THE TEENAGERS AT MY FAMILY XMAS ENJOYED IT. THEY TOOK IT OUTSIDE WHEN IT GOT DARK & THREW IT FOR HOURS & IT LOOKED NEAT BUT IT WASNT WHAT I HAD THOUGHT IT WAS. IF YOU ORDER IT JUST NOTE THAT IT DOESNT COME IN A SET AS SHOWN IN PICTURE - ITS JUST ONE OF THOSE FRISBEES & ITS A REGULAR SIZED FRISBEE THAT LIGHTS UP IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE.
1,IT SUCKS,"[...]i heard it was indestructable but i threw it into a wood chipper and it shredded into peices, so it suks and isn't strong.[...]"
3,Warning: requires internet connection and registration,"The Adobe suite is still the only option out there for serious Mac developers. However, the price and heavy handed approach to registration is overwhelming. I now can't use my version because the computer it was registered on was upgraded to Leopard and Adobe thinks all registrations are used. Requires an internet connection to even launch. It may run in demo mode for 30 days without an internet connection after registration, don't know for sure. I don't like being treated like a crook after spending thousands of dollars and being a loyal customer for a decade.Also the updater seems to run every other use since so many products are in the suite. Granted, I only need it about every two weeks. Arg.... another Microsoft!"
2,Buggy,I have found CS3 to be quite buggy on Mac OS X Lion. I have looked into upgrading to the newer versions but I can't be sure it won't crash on my system.
4,Homecoming in Heaven,"""Going Home"" features songs and a collection of short narratives and readings that turn our thoughts toward heaven. The concert opens with the Homecoming Friends singing ""The Meeting in the Air."" Terry Blackwood was featured singing ""That Glad Reunion Day"" and the Vocal Band are strong in their arrangement of ""Knowing You'll Be There.""My personal favorites include ""It Will Be Worth It All"" and ""Beyond the Sunset.""Featured artists include: Larnelle Harris, Joni Eareckson Tada, The Easters, Lynda Randale, Allen Asbury, The Isaacs, Jeanne Johnson, Vestal Goodman, Mark Lowry, The Hoppers, and many others. A number of fine ensembles were made up of members of the Homecoming Friends regulars.The promise of heaven and home is an important part of the Christian life. This concert is a beautiful reminder of that hope and of God's grace."
1,Going Home,Received the Going Home DVD in perfect condition and in the time promised. Well packaged too.
1,Where's Janet ?,"Janet Paschal fans will be disappointed that, despite showing her photo on the cover of this product, she is virtually absent from the production. I searched every second of the video for a glimpse of Janet, and found only a quickly passing shot as she sang in the background with dozens of other ""Homecoming Friends"". If you're a Janet Paschal fan, like me, you'll have to wait until she publishes a concert video of her own. This product has been falsely advertised."
5,Great for the would be Swat member with a different calling,"I've got to say that I've always had a fascination with Swat work, but alas I'm more of a music minded person than anything. I believe this game has given me a ""taste"" of maybe what it would've been. I'm a police augmentee and where I work when I'm called, nothing exciting happens. In the game, as the Element Leader, the game is such that you need to constantly think about the ""morale"" of your team members. If you make stupid decisions, you lose a bit o' respect and based on a declining leadership score, your team members are a bit reluctant to act. Thus the pressure is on to be decisive and effective. The variety of scenarios: store front, bank, cathedral, residence, hit close to home as I've often thought about what it might be like to try to take on situations that I see on 'Cops', 'Inside Report', etc. Warning: It's ADDICTIVE. In fact, I'm gonna go play it right now! End of transmission, Dragon, clear."
4,Sweeet Functionality,"I have to say that this game would be one of the best PC games out there. Now, it is rated Mature, but it could stand a little more Juicing to live up to its rating. For instance, If you shoot a perp, its not to life like. You can however enable the NC17 option, but that really makes it Phoney looking. The blood doesn't look life like at all. It just kinda splatters around the dead perp. But, on the other hand, body movement, gunfire, grafX and game play are pretty intense. You find yourself cursing it out and playing it again and again. This one Rates high on my ""Must have"" list for all you gamers."
4,Above Average,"I found this game pretty good. Sometimes your partners get in your way and they don't follow your orders exactly. It is pretty challenging. The bad guys are always somewhere different and can be pretty tricky. I like more shooting though(ex:Delta Force2). The game can be a little boring sometimes, but great graphics and a good challenge."
5,Love it,"I didn't know i needed this till i accidentally ran across it while looking for something else.Its polycarbonate or plastic,whatever, its thick and it works it saves me time finding centers for my turnings.I highly recommend this,its cheap but works well."
4,Gets you close... use a fine point pencil for best results,"Simple, cheap, and effective but I can't really mark the exact center using the directions which say to make two lines. You'll be off by the width of your pencil lead. To get close I make 4 lines at 90 degree stops around the circle which gives you a double crosshair type pattern with a small box in the middle. The small box will be close to the exact center. A really fine pointed pencil would allow you to get closer. Handy tool and glad I bought it."
5,Get at least one.,"For this price, why bother making your own? There are tons of do-it-yourself articles on making these, but you need one of these to make one accurately. Odds are that if you order one of these, you'll wish you had ordered more when you get it.Why these aren't in every home improvement store I'll never figure out. They are useful, inexpensive, well made and great conversation pieces - ""Do you know what this is?""."
4,It Works,"The center finder works and is easy to use. Being plastic, have to be careful, but for the price, I bought 2."
1,Not Compatible With Rubber Bushings.,"Be careful with this stuff it caused the rubber caliper slide bushings to swell on my car. This product says compatible with rubber according to Permatex website but I think they are wrong. The MSDS says proprietary blend, well something in that blend is incompatible with rubber causing it to swell. I like this stuff just don't let it touch your rubber slide bushings."
2,Appealing : but Fragile,"I bought this toy for my grandson's third birthday in April. It was a big hit initially . He loved it. Within weeks, however, it began to come apart. By the time I saw it in mid-June, the loader was falling off and couldn't be repaired. The trailer hitch wasn't working so the trailer fell off constantly. Next a pedal fell off. My daughter reports that it has been very lightly used. We are all very disappointed . Its such an appealing looking toy, it seems a shame it couldn't be made more durable."
4,Good fun for a 3 year old,My son wanted a tractor themed birthday party for months before his 3rd birthday. This gift was perfect and it gets used often.It seems durable and can handle the rough play of boys.
5,watch for thieves,This toy was so great and appealing that 2 grown men stole it from my 3 year old grandson. I would strongly recommend that you not leave this toy out in the open for the horrible people that will steal from a baby.Heartsick Grandmother.
5,crowd pleaser,I have three boys between the ages of 5 thru 2 who love to ride this toy. I would recommend this type of ride on toy over a battery operated toy.
1,3C985B-SX,"I buy this NIC card, but it does not come with a RJ 45 PORT, you can not use this card on your computers..."
2,Not about molestation - Elektra complex,"The story of a little girl who is alone with her father while her mother goes out of town for the weekend. The little girl says she wants to marry her daddy, and tries to do all the things her mother does (makeup, dress-up, making pancakes) and even tries to sleep in the bed with her father. She keeps throwing out the bait, but her dad just isn't taking any of it. He tells her that she can't do all the things her mom does. The end though, is the creepiest part of all. The little girl decides that even though she can't marry her own daddy, she can still grow up to be like her mother and marry someone who is just like her daddy."
1,FIFA is SO SO SO MUCH BETTER,"Thought sony might finally come out with a good soccar game, but I was very wrong. FIFA still dominats this spot."
1,Even worse than FIFA!!,"Slow game play, horrible looking pitch, player model has NO SHOULDERS - and looks HORRIBLE, animations are stilted and mechanical for the most part.It Has a seperate button dedicated to feigning an injury - I don't want to play a game in which I could move my team forward by PRETENDING TO BE HURT. Infact, pretending to be hurt is one of the biggest problems giving professional soccer a bad reputation - and this company has actually made it part of their game!!!! Aaaiiiiiigggggghhhh!!!What happened to fun?Stay away!!!!"
3,Better than FIFA.....Not enough!!!!!!,"This days having a better game than FIFA is....EASY!!! I love soccer, and EA Sports makes the best sports games, but not in the soccer depot. WTS2002 plays good overall, nice stadiums, teams, player faces, uniforms, all are done the right way. Passing is very good, as well as tackling ans stealing the ball, the only minus is shooting ala ""FIFA"" I wish shooting would be more realistic. The most realistic shooting game there is in the soccer games is MLS. FIFA well you all know, unrealistic goals from unrealistic places. Buy this game, its the best there is on the market right know. We should wait for the Madden of soccer in the future."
2,A definite rental....,"This game isn't the best soccer game in the world. I was pretty disappointed when I first bought it. Sure it gives you more than 300 teams to choose from but they don't really show the team stats very well. FIFA 2002 is a much better game. Also, when you want to change the player's name, you can only change the first name which really sucks! Sometimes during a tournament, the game says that your team is invalid and you can't play the match. For those who love soccer games, I would definitely go with the FIFA games such as FIFA 2003. I have also heard that the Winning Eleven games are pretty good too so you might want to check those out. Overall, I have found this game as a so-so game and a definite rent-first."
5,What A Shame,"Its a shame that this event was not properly recorded on video, as well as an album. This should have been treated as important as TCB, or On Broadway....C'mon Berry, what were you thinking, other than separating Diana from The Supremes? A historic piece of musical history should have been recorded for all time Where is it?????????????????"
3,Captured Live On Stage,The recording was great but I will not pay over $50.00 for a CD. I have seen the Supremes Live on stage for less than $172.00
5,Beautiful,"This book contains many beautiful pictures, which are key to defining period style furniture adn architecture. The chapters are clearly defined and arranged in a logical, easy to use manner. It is a must for anyone seeking a career in Historical Preservation."
5,The Best,This book is amazing. It literally takes you through every single time era since Baroque and breaks down all the design aspects of interior and exterior design. It's an amazing buy if you want to see a lot of pictures and not as much words. They show both a drawn picture of everything and a real picture of everything to show how something might be seen on a blueprint. It's an amazing book for those who are just entering the design world but perhaps also those who have been in the world for a while and want to challenge themselves by recreating the perfect Tutor Arch or Gothic Vaulting. I highly recommend it.
2,Very Disappointing...,"Unfortunately, the many rave reviews here -- mostly from Middle Easterners who probably grew up on this food -- lead me to purchase this cookbook. Bad decision! The near absence of photos is a definite drawback, particularly with an ethnic cookbook. Even if you know the cuisine well, the token information on presentation is a serious shortcoming. Also, I found many of the recipies to be either less than exciting, overly complicated, or a bit odd.For a much more helpful guide, look at ""The Middle Eastern Cookbook"" by Maria Khalife. As a Notre Dame educator and TV chef, her well-designed cookbook offers exciting recipies and extensive illustrations of Middle Eastern dishes you'll actually serve at home."
2,Virtually no illustrations ...,I found this book to be a turn-off mainly because it lacks illustrations. I hope the next edition will take care of this major flaw of otherwise a decent effort.
5,A great Mediterranean addition to my cookbook collection,"I originally found this gem in my local library and quickly decided I needed a copy of my own. I continue to try and enjoy the recipes and have since received cooking compliments from even my staunchest Arab critics. In addition to the accurate recipes, the author provides cultural and religious insight that is informative and easily digestible for the Western cook. I plan to use this cookbook for decades to come."
4,I love this game,"I am not a gamer. I have no gaming sophistication. My mother-in-law gave this to me; I have no idea why. I began to play it. I have been playing it for several years. It is my only computer game, but I come back to it over and over. My children, older teens and early 20's, have given me several other games, much more sophisticated, but this is my game. One selects a playing piece, some form of robot tank. One proceeds through a variety of terrains seeking power cores. When one obtains all of the cores, one proceeds to the next level. There are about 25 levels or so. One is opposed by tanks protecting the power cores, all robotozed. There is no blood, no gore. Just fast action, learning to shoot accurately, and obtain and work through a variety of weapons. And then the flying tanks attack, and one must learn new tactics. I find the three dimensional playing fields fascinating and imaginative."
3,Eclisiastical architecture of a region of Mexico,"The title is somewhat misleading. This is a guide book, a tour of four Mexican states that focuses almost exclusively on eclisiastical buildings. Useful if you are interested in architecture and are touring in Michoacan, Jalisco, Guanajuatao, and Quertaro. Line drawings are nice, obviously drawn off of photos.The book is large in format (so a bit awkward to travel with) and the design of the book is mediocre -- headline fonts are quite unattractive.I would only recommend this book to those with a deep interest in religious architecture and architectural decoration in Mexico."
3,Not worth more than $10,"I don't write many reviews, but one of the previous reviews pushed my decision to purchase this album which at the time of writing was $27 because it is an import. It WAS NOT worth it. I am a big fan of ""Rising to the Top"", and I still believe it is a timeless classic. However, the album on the whole is a typical 80's R&B album. Same ballads, same melodies with the same sythesized instruments. There's nothing revolutionary or breakthrough about this album. I only recommend buying this album if you're a die hard Keni Burke fan or there's a song on here you can't find anywhere else. You can find ""Rising to the Top"" on other (cheaper) compilation cd's....."
2,Irregular motion,"Despite what others say, my mouse became skippy and sometimes even very slow, especially when a program is active or running. Sometimes the mouse would just freeze for several seconds. But sometimes it happens out of nowhere. My old MS optical mouse never had any problems. Also the buttons are too small. Sometimes when i clicked the right mouse button, I pressed the edge. The only good thing about this mouse is that it looks decent"
5,Great mouse for begginers and advanced internet fanatics,"Optical mice are great, worth the money.I recently bought this mouse to replace a microsoft mouse of similar style (cordless and optical) and it works great. I bought the microsoft mouse because it had the internet back and forward browswer buttons which is a great idea. After I installed the mouse i had a few conflicts my laptops touchpad (which i never had with any logitech mouse) and after trying to get everything to working the way i liked it to with my previous logitech (cordless but not optical) eventually my computer crashed and just wouldn't start. I had a do a system reboot and retore my comp to factory settings all because of the MS mouse. then i bought this mouse (which uses the same software as my old logitech) and it works beautifully, no problems yet, and my laptop touchpad also works the way i want it to. Once you go optical you never go back."
5,Mighty Mouse,"I had been shopping for a mouse to replace the cheapo one which came with my computer. I really wanted a cordless one, but was concerned that perhaps a cordless mouse would be subject to all kinds of problems and therefore not be nearly as accurate. But, based on the reviews here at Amazon, I was convinced to purchase the Logitech Cordless Optical Wheel Mouse. Thank you Amazon reviewers and thank you Logitech! This wonderful little piece of electronics is FAR MORE accurate and responsive than my old mouse. And no more constant tugging on the cord. It also clicks very quietly (my old mouse was loud enough to wake people up). A terrific mouse at a very reasonable price. Do not hesitate to buy this if you are looking for a new mouse.Just one slight problem to mention ... during the software installation, the setup program asks you to click on your responses - which is, of course, strangely impossible since the new mouse is not working yet. Use the tab and enter keys instead."
1,Stay Away,"I have used this mouse for almost a year. I have to change the batteries at least once a week. Also, Logitech has never answered all the e-mails I have sent regarding this issue. Check out their on-line site and read the forum they have. Most of the listings mirror what I have a problem with. Logitech does not back up their problems. Stay away from this company!"
1,Do not waste your money on this one!,"I bought this mouse a couple of months ago, and I wish Ihadn't wasted my money. The mouse cursor jumps all overthe place, and is extremely frustrating to use. This happensregardless of the distance between the base and the mouse,and regardless of which computer I try to use it on.I strongly recommend against buying this mouse!"
4,Better for a Tower than a Laptop,"This is a great mouse. Great tracking ability, long battery life...but the receiver is VERY clunky and large. That's not a big deal when you have a desktop computer with a lot of peripherals already, but when you're using a laptop and want to keep your workspace to a minimum, it's something to consider.Also, the logitech software you download to your computer gives little pop-up messages which I find extremely annoying, but may not bother other users."
4,"Comfort, precision, power hungry","I chose this mouse by trying all of them in a large electronics store. Its feel in my small hand was by far the best At first, I paused at its relatively high price but then I realized how much I use my mouse--and I'm worth it. After using it for several months, I am still delighted by its ergonomics and control-ability. The only complaint I have is that the batteries wear out faster than I'd like, perhaps every 2 months."
3,A decent mouse but can improve,"I have been using a touchpad for the past 2 years. I bought this mouse for my wife and tried it for the first few days. On Windows XP, the install is clean. But I was surprised to see that this mouse does not ship with a mousepad. An Optical mouse by virtue of it's technology should be used on a specific surface otherwise it results in a jerky movement. Also there was no instructions whatsoever to suggest the kind of surface to be used on.It is very sensitive and people used to traditional mice or touchpads will take time to adjust."
2,Not as complete as it should be,Has a poor color wheel and charts as well as mixing examples and instructions with different mediums. However it does discuss color theory well and gives some excellent examples and exercises. Despite this I did not find it a text book worth keeping and will continue my search for a better book on color.
5,"Color, 3rd Ed.","Excellent source for artists, archietcts, or designers who want to push the envelope with color. Definite must for students in any Art and Design school!"
3,"worth having, if a little boring","This book is kind of useful for stimulating thought on color, but is not really amazing to me. I'm still looking for a color book that impresses me as much as some of the design or typography books I've read."
4,Think and learn,"Few games pack the depth of historical info that I found in 12 O'clock High. With the help of a smooth interface, the Allied player plots countless raids aimed at the German War Machine. Every target imaginable is in the game, and the available aircraft match history, too. The busy Axis player must intercept the raids, and the action is intense and varied. Talonsoft is noted for solid game design and a loving eye for military detail accuracy. If you're a WW2 buff, you shouldn't pass this one by."
1,Frustration by Talonsoft,"This, as with most TalonSoft games using this particular game engine, is a tedious, difficult, and generally overly time consuming game. No matter how you set game options, the AI will make the game so difficult that playing becomes an exercise in futility. Example: the AI will ground your fighter escorts because of ""heavy weather"", yet the enemy's interceptors have no problem flying in the same weather and shooting down your bombers. Your bomber pilots will ""not be able to find target"" in perfectly clear weather at low altitude, but will be shot down by flak over same target. Overall, an exercise in frustation. I think the designers coded this game purposely to make conditions as unrealistic and historically inacurate as possible, in spite of their claims to the opposite. If you like the sound of fingernails against a blackboard, you'll like this game!"
5,Bird watcher,I am an amateur backyard bird watcher and I love these binoculars! My yard is a few acres and these are just perfect. Excellent quality. We have a few other pairs of binoculars on various windowsills but my husband and I are always reaching for these first! We end up passing them back and forth.....maybe I'll buy him his own pair someday ;-)
3,adequate,"For the price these binoculars are ok, the wheel to adjust distances is stiff. I much prefer my Nikon 7 x 35 glasses of the same price (15 years ago!) that I lost-much sharper, crisper image."
3,Does not work with iPhone,"I got this for my Gen 3 Ipod. It worked great. But it's not compatible with my iPhone, which I used to replace my iPod."
1,Stinks,I obviously thought this was something else. I have two different Vetiver colognes so I thought this essential oil would be a nice addition. IT SMELLS NOTHING LIKE THE COLOGNES! My bad! This smells like the aftermath of a camp fire that's been left wet for a week. Yuck!
1,Poor Fit,Now I know why they were selling them out. The sizes bear no relationship to the shoe. The shoe mind you is a good quality but they are about two sizes smaller than stated. Well at least a size and a half.
2,It Could have been Better,I agree with the others in saying that this was not the best romance novel ever. It had way to many things going on at once. It was suppose to be straight romance I suppose but it had suspence in it as well and they never even solved it. The relationships in it was really weak as well. The ending was the most annoying part of all. I too am a avid reader and I was not please at all with this book
3,MY SON'S FAVORITE TEETHER...Update!,"My son loved this fish teether. He liked chewing on both the water filled and solid ends. He wanted to take it everywhere and it always ended up in the carseat on roadtrips.Update: Fast forward a few years... I now have another child and have since learned a lot about how toxic plastics can be. I no longer recommend this product for that reason. Instead, I use natural alternatives... wood teethers, natural rubber, or organic cotton are much safer."
3,Meh,"This is not one of her better books. It was really hard to follow. Too bad, too, because I have loved most of her other books."
4,Great for remembering Japanese verbs,"It's an interesting book and it really helped me remember Japanese verbs. It doesn't cover conjugation or anything else, it's simply about how to remember the actual verbs and the meanings. I recommend it to anyone learning Japanese."
3,"Ok, but not great.","I bought this book because of the great reviews.I dont think its that greats. Its just a list of Japanese verbs and adjectives coupled with a short English phrase to help you remember it. There are fundamental mistakes in the book, where a few Japanese words are spelled wrong, which means the English phrases no longer works. These are very basic words and i dont see how its possible to make this mistake, its not a typo, the Author actually believes thats how the word is spelled/pronounced.The end of a the book has contact details for the Author, which do not work. Dead webpages etc.Additionally, the verbs take up most of the book, with the adjectives simply tagged on at the end (even though they are equal in number).It just goes to show, the whole book could have simply been a list written in a few pages, for free on someones web page.Finally, i should just add - you could just make up your own way to remember these words, the Author has no particular talent for it."
3,Inspiring biography of WWII Hero.,"This is a long (2 hour, 17 minute) film that is leisurely paced as it depicts dedicated Wassell, American M.D. stationed in Java during WW II, who goes against direct orders to stay with and then evacuate wounded men under his care. Technicolor is beautiful and Cooper is perfectly cast as the humanitarian doctor. Too slow for some, but nevertheless absorbing and inspiring. Oscar Nom for Special Effects. Worth a watch."
5,The Most Overlooked Classic Movie Of All Time,"This is one of Gary Cooper's finest movies--up there right along side ""High Noon"" and ""Friendly Persuasion"", yet it is one that few people today have ever heard of. It is a wonderful story, based on a real person and his real life, in which Gary Cooper plays Dr. Corydon Wassell, an Arkansas country doctor who goes to China to practice medicine and while there is caught up in WWII. He becomes a Naval Officer devoted to caring for the wounded and his heroism under fire eventually earns him the Navy Cross and a nationally broadcast commendation from President Roosevelt. This is a film the whole family can watch, enjoy and feel good about at the end."
5,A welcome eye-witness testimony,"Light One Candle: A Survivor's Tale From Lithuania To Jerusalem is the autobiographical story of Solly Ganor, a man who survived the unspeakable holocaust of the Second World War when he was 13 years old through the intervention and rescue of a Japanese American soldier in 1945 (who himself had been releases from a U.S. internment camp for Japanese Americans just a few months earlier. Light One Candle is a powerful and vividly told memoir of struggle, starvation, and the brutal tolls of concentration and extermination camps. Light One Candle is a welcome eye-witness testimony and a very highly recommended addition to personal reading lists as well as academic and community library Holocaust Studies reference collections."
5,Amazing!!,so well written. I can't begin to find the words to say how this book touched me. Everyone should be required to read this.
3,Non Musical,"Only one song survives in this film, which apparently was made as a musical, but were mostly removed because of changing tastes.The film therefore is a little strange with musical comedy stars doing comedy without much music.However it is still very watchable with Joe E Brown and Winnie Lightner working well together in this wrestling story from WARNER Studios.."
5,Sit tight & watch Joe E. Brown clown,"It seems strange that anyone would make a movie musical about wrestling. Thus, the music was jettisoned (with the exception of one song). What remains is an energetic comedy that shows off comedian Joe E. Brown's athletic prowess at a health sanitarium. Naturally, Joe gives off some of his trademark yells, which are always good for a laugh. And the film is climaxed with hapless Joe having to fight some ""wrestler's kid brother""--which turns out to be gorilla--until the calvary arrives to save him.A fun & funny Joe E. Brown vehicle!"
4,A Powerful Revision of Amerindian/Xicana Women's History!,"Massacre of the Dreamers is Ana Castillo's transdisciplinary book about the deconstruction of Mexic pallocentric ""pyramids,"" as she herself puts it. By re(w)riting history, Castillo reconfigures the role of the Amerindian/Xicana/Mexican woman, allowing her to draw strength from Mesoamerican female goddesses. In this remarkable text, furthermore, Castillo employs her ""own raw materials"" (104) as an antidote to male-centered cosmic consciousness that operates in binary frames of dualisms, dichotomies, and schisms. In resurecting her spiritual mother goddesses, Castillo, like Anzaldua and Cisneros, reinserts ""the forsaken feminine into our consciousness"" (12). By exposing the manner in which the xicana has been ""gagged"" for hundreds of years, Castillo rejects colonization and mapps a xicana history with a difference that allows the Amerindian woman's various selves to coexist simultaneously, reinforcing her identity"
3,Not in as good a shape as most books.,This book is worn. But it is totally readable so I will not complain. It doesn't have any writing in it and really is O.K.
3,Based on the motion comic,"This DVD release is based on the motion comic available for streaming free elsewhere. I enjoyed the graphic novel look of the show, though the action was lacking, but I have discovered that this DVD release will be all that you will ever see since the comic and thus motion comic have been cancelled."
2,Not an animated movie but a motion comic,"Although the story is great, this is not an animated movie. This is a motion comic with voices. The art is amazing, the voices bring life to the semi still images. Just be aware that its a motion comic."
4,"Motion comic, not animated movie","For those who thought this was an animated movie, it's not. It's a motion comic.I'm generally not a fan of motion comics myself; I would prefer true animation, but this was a good story. I really loved the comic version of this. I'm not even a huge Spider-Woman fan, I just picked it up a used run cheaply on ebay and really enjoyed this story a lot. I would suggest reading the comic, but if you are a fan of motion comics then pick this up."
3,Are those real?,"Wow. This review isn't so much about the content of this motion comic as the way it's packaged. That cover. That art. Holy Gigantic D-Cup, Batman! The way comic book publishers continue to pander to the fantasies (power and otherwise) of teenage boys never fails to astonish me. Her name is Spider-Woman, I get that; now, what are THEIR names? Peter Parker feels his spidey-sense tingling, but it isn't because of Dr. Octopus this time."
2,Wasn't Interested,First off this is free on Netflix if you have it. Along with a lot of newly realeased Marvels available for streamline on Netflix.I was bored. Action comic. If you dont mind not much movement go for it. Not for children to watch. With earlier Marvels I would let my 6 year old watch but this was to grafic even for me as it wasn't what I was expectiong. This is for adult and mature teens only.
1,this cartoon sucks,Are you kidding me!! I want my 19.99 back!! Marvel is just stealing money from the faithful!! Amazon should be ashamed for even selling this!!
1,The wackness,I just cannot express how weak this was. The day I got it it was available on Netflix. I suffered through the whole thing. No bueno.
2,"Good concept, needs further development.","I was rather disappointed in some aspects of this book. The pages are divided into columns, with an explanation of the Spanish application of a concept in one column and the explanation of the corresponding English concept in the other. Unfortunately, the columns do not align well, and the English and Spanish examples of the concepts do not align. I was surprised at how difficult this made reading the book. I also found the explanations overly technical and I had difficulty comprehending the linguistic terms (but perhaps this is my limitation, not the books.) I would recommend Spanish Verbs and Essentials of Grammar by Ina Ramboz or the Practice Makes Perfect series as better alternatives."
3,Mistakes,"I like the idea of the book but was dismayed to find 3 errors on one page. I went to the publisher's website to see if they put out an errata page but none was there. (I am using the Second Edition 6th printing)The mistakes I found (this was the second page I was reading !) on p.43 are:1. reference to Appendix I, p. 121 should be p. 1452. (referring to the English what?) It does have different forms for gender and number. should be 'does NOT'3. (referring to ¿cuál?) ..there are different forms to show gender and number should be different forms to show number (not gender)"
4,Spanish & English Grammar,I love this book. It is very easy to follow and it makes learning Spanish easy with the English instructions.
4,A real satisfying mystery,"Murder in Jackson Hole is the second J Royal Horton novel I have read, and it hits the spot yet again. Chief Detective Tommy Thompson is on the trial again, this time with a real pair of troublemakers dishing out drugs and trouble.In Murder in Jackson Hole, the veteran Thompson is at first sitting behind his desk ruing local politics and local domestic crimes. Then the District Attorney turns up and Thompson is in the action, following clues that will lead him to Dex Dexter and Bugs Miranda.The plot of this story is cleverly layered, with good passages about the local scenery mixed with Thompson's own detective skills and local knowledge. Over the course of the novel, Thompson finds himself caught up in an increasingly complex situation involving murder and corruption.Murder in Jackson Hole is a solidly enjoyable mystery novel with a likeable protagonist. I can imagine seeing more of Chief Detective Tommy Thompson in the future."
5,Full marks for a top story,"The first I have read from J. Royal Horton, in what will hopefully be a succession of equally good novels that I purchase. Set in Jackson, a detective called Tom strives to do what all cops do and keep the local population safe from the evils of the world but as the tide of drugs and other activities teenagers typical like to undertake it is never plain sailing, especially when some murders are added to the mix.If you have grown through a similar change in a community you will see parallels in the story I am sure, if you have not then you will be on the lookout for it happening nearer home than you would like.I found this to be a well-crafted and quick moving novel and one I found myself returning to very quickly after putting it down as I wanted to get to the next chapter to see what was going to happen next."
3,only for professionals!,"Great dancing, great moves, but this viseo is for advanced learner only. If you are a beginner or intermediate dancer, forget it. I wish the advertisement was clearer about that."
5,No issues,"This works great, have a couple. Also bought one to hack the post off and use to block the coupler, lock the coupler with this in and no post and it's a great piece of additional safety from anyone trying to drive off with the camper."
4,wrong size,Part number and actual shaft length did not match desciption. Since I needed a very specific size anyway it worked out fine. I cut the excess length to the exact size I needed. Product quality/price very good.
1,Made in China,I thought the CURT products were made in the USA so I ordered this ball instead of the Reese but its made in China. What a shame!
4,Worth the money,Bought this for your 20 mo son. For the price I paid on amazon ~54$ its was well worth it. The build quality is good. It's sturdy and not cheap. None of the edges are sharp and I feel comfortable leaving him alone with it. Besides riding it he plays with the trike in many different positions using his imagination. Definitely recommended.
2,poorly designed,"the price was ok. but I thought I would be getting more functionality for the $. in order to make the ""rocking"" or the ""pushing"" options work, you have to screw and unscrew parts. we have a horse than can be ridden or rocked, and it's as simple as pushing a button and clicking it in place. why couldn't they design the product this way? we will NEVER use it in any other capacity because keeping up with screws and dealing with the wear and tear because of the screwing/unscrewing...and the time and frustration it would take to keep switching it when we needed to...not going to happen. wish we had chosen a different product."
1,Almost umpossible to assemble,I think there is some design problem that make the assembling almost impossible. You have to use a POWERFUL drill to create new holes to finish. I have to call the customer service to get the job done.
5,Good product,This product is quite worth for all children from 1 to 5 years. It will help to children in their all development stage. So I am very much satisfied with this product
1,Very disappointed (Do NOT Buy),I cannot assemble it since there is no pre-drilled holes on the handlebar column. I contact with the customer service and they said they cannot do anything. The only choice is to return it and I have to pay for the shipping.I don't understand it. How can you expect the customer to drill a hole? Not everybody is handy man and not everybody has the electric drill. I actually have an electric drill but is not that powerful so it does not work.Very very disappointed!
4,Great trike for toddlers and beyond!,Length:: 1:38 MinsI thought I'd have my son Connor demonstrate how this tricycle passes the toddler test.
5,grows with your child. Worth every penny.,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was one. He is now 5 and still is able to ride it, along with my 3 yr old daughter. There are so many toys out there with such a short life span I feel you really get your money's worth. I also like the adjustable seat as my daughter is tiny. My one yr old also tries to ride. I have never had this tip and my son is quite rough with it. I have given this gift multiple times to friends and always receive rave reviews. Although I was disappointed that a ""light and sound"" version came out. I would save your money and buy the original, as the noises can be distracting when riding...and too many things have sound these days."
3,"Fun, but not too durable","I bought this trike for my son when he was about 15 months old. He is now 2 and still uses it. I see him using this trike for at least another year, if not more.PROS: The bright colors and versatile design make it attractive for parents and toddlers. It's light-weight, making it easy to push with your toddler while he's sitting on it.CONS: There is a big distance between the pedals and the seat, so my two-year-old, who is tall for his age, still struggles to pedal the trike. This is frustrating for him. The foot-rest is very unsteady and short, so he cannot keep his feet on it while we're pushing the trike along. Eventually he ends up with his feet on the ground, pushing the trike along like a ride-on toy without pedals. Also the wheels get easily damaged on rough roads (we use it on a tarred bike-path).Bottom line: I would have bought a different, more durable trike and, on hindsight, probably one that my child had test-ridden first."
2,Age range misleading,My son got this trike for christmas when he was 18 months old. The product gives a range of 18-24 month. He has always been in the 90 percentile of height so I was surprised when I noticed he can't reach the pedals. He is now 2 y/o and still can't reach the pedals or the foot rest. This is a toy for 2 1/2 - 4 y/o. Don't buy this toy for a toddler.
5,Great little trike!,We love the fact our toddler can't fall over in this trike. It's super safe. The color is bright and he loves it. Terrific trike for the purchase.
4,Rockin' fun,"I purchased this product for my one year old granddaughter. She loves to be pushed, inside the house and outside, too. As she gets older, and taller, she will be able to ride the toy herself. It grows with her."
5,good but....,the foot rest slips which makes my son feet hit the ground & makes us stop short & the push handle Is way to short& after a long walk it will hurt my back other than this when he learns to ride this bike by him self It will be a great first bike we have the first verison of this biek not the new one
4,"Good, solid buy","My 21-month-old son loves this trike. He wants to ride it every night when he gets home from daycare (and every morning before we leave). He can operate it well, although he can't quite reach the pedals (he pushes along the ground). He loves that he can get this bike really going fast. As other reviewers have commented, the footrest (used when pushed by parent) doesn't lock in the down position, so his feet slip off. However, he likes me to push it while he just holds his feet up. The push bar is a great feature... he can ride until he gets tired, then I can push him like a stroller. We've only had this two weeks, and I haven't tried the ""rock"" feature. Overall, it seems to be a good purchase and one of the easiest trikes to ride of all the ones we tried. You can tell he really feels empowered and in command of the road when he's riding it."
4,"Vroom, Vroom!","We recently got our 1 1/2-year-old this. It was very inexpensive, and it goes from a rocking trike, to a push trike, to a trike he can ride on his own. Right now, he's into pushing it...mostly into walls! But he enjoys it. And it's wonderful not to have to bend over to push him on it! Why wasn't that around with my nephews??? The only downside is that the rocking action isn't very much, so it doesn't really hold his attention for that. But as a trike, it's pretty inexpensive and will last a while, so it's well worth the money!"
2,Not worth the $$,"I got this for my son because all the great reviews. I paid full price (something I never do). He wanted a bike like his sister, so I bought this so I could push it. The biggest problem with this bike it that THE ADULT CAN'T STEER!!! It is SO frustrating! The child has control of the handles, the steering doesn't lock! Money wasted! I ended up buying him a 12in bike w/training wheels, and attached a ""balance buddY"" handle to the FRONT.....problem solved! Now that he is a year older, I used the handle to help him learn to pedal....he learned to ride in 3 days! Now I have the handle on the back of my daughters big bike to help her learn to ride w/o training wheels. My son is fine on his bike. The Rock N Roll bike sits....and I will be selling it this year..."
5,the best buy of toy,"My son loves this toy, he used since he have 9 months , and now he has 1 year and 3 months and he ride it along."
5,Favorite gift ever!,This is definately the BEST toy my son has ever received! He got it for his first birthday and has not stopped with it yet! He LOVES to climb up on it and rock as hard as he can (which is ok since it doesn't rock to hard). It converts very quick and painlessly to a push trick for our walks. He loves everything about this toy! Recommend it to anyone with a rambunctious little boy/girl! Takes their energy out!
5,Great product!!,"Again, Fisher Price wins with this new affordable, yet very sturdy tricycle. I bought it for my 1-1/2 & 3 year old and they love it!!! Before buying, I read the online reviews on this product & the other tricycles as sold by Toys R Us. I can't say enough good about this product. The price was right, the product is made by a name I trust, & they've covered all areas of concern. This product is great for younger kids since they can ride it as a 'rocking horse' first. It's very sturdy & despite my kids high spirited rocking, didn't come close to tipping over. Don't hesitate!!"
3,nice for younger children,"My boy/girl twins each got one of these for their 2nd birthday. I thought they would really enjoy being pushed around and being able to pedal also but they are not interested in playing with them. They have the fisher price trikes at my parents house which are actually a little bigger than these and they seem to enjoy them much more. They hate when I try to push them and to be honest it is a little hard unless they will cooperate with steering because you have no control over turning corners when pushing with the handle! I think it would have been really nice to have had when they were younger so they could have used it as a rocker. I don't think I would recommend buying this for 1 1/2 and up, I would just go with the bigger fisher price trikes, diego or princess. Unless you are buying this for babies around 6 months you won't really get your money's worth!"
3,Child loves it; I hate it.,"This ride-on toy had all the qualities I was looking for, plus great ratings. My son loves to be pushed around on it (he can't reach the pedals yet). The problem is that the foot rest bar dislodges frequently (it just snaps into place) and my son's feet begin to drag. So we have to stop way too often to reset it. Our walk together goes from relaxing to infuriating! Think I'll try some duct tape. :o)However, it could just be a defect with our bike. It is very sturdy and otherwise very well designed. When converting between options, sturdy plastic tubes are used as pins to keep the handles and seat in place. Wish they'd done that with the foot rest!"
3,OK Toy,My son is 18 Month. He likes to stand on the seat of the bike. I hope there is a bell strap for it.
3,Good buy for the price depending on extent of usage,We bought this bike about a month back for our son- he is 2 years and 5 months old. He hasn't learnt how to pedal yet so the real test will be when he starts pedalling and we'll have to see how long the bike lasts. It seems like a good buy for the price though- looks good- our son loves it. Only issue is that the foot stand in between dosent have enough space for his 2 feet. The assembly was also not very difficult- took my husband around 3 hours.
4,this bike saved my back,"I bought this bike for a 16 month old granddaughter to keep the peace with her 2-1/2 year old sister who has a regular tricycle. I found the handle height fine, but I am about 5'2"", so taller adults may not. The little one loves this bike, whether being pushed along or rocking on it. Her sister also rocks on it and can pedal it. I wish the footrest were a little more forward in position as it would be more comfortable for her, but she is already trying to pedal. We only use this inside on tile flooring and it works great. As they grow, I may put the little one on the other trike and let the older ride this one as the seat adjusts. Both girls are very tall for their age; smaller children at this age may find this bike too large."
3,Toy is good,"I bought this for my daughter, it is very useful for her and keeps her occupied throughout the day. However it looks bit clunky and is useful only for kids in 2-3 year agerange."
5,highly recomended,My son got this toy for his first birthday. he is now 4 and still loves it. i have not had one problem with it. the duradlity it great! i acidently ran the bike over with my SUV and all that got ruined was the wheel. even with the wheel a little bent out of shape my son still has no problem riding it. i can not wait to get one for my daughter this year.
5,Wonderful Trike!!,"I read the reviews about trouble with the assembly of this product and decided to give it a try anyway. The product was assembled in about 25 minutes and my granddaughter is delighted! The assembly is simple, the instructions are complete. I'm not sure what went wrong for the people that had trouble with assembly, but I am quite sure it was not the products fault. It appears to be a clear case of mal-funtioning assemblers!! LOL"
2,"Trike is way too hard to pedal, 3-year-old still can't reach the pedals!","We gave this trike to our son when he was 1, thinking he would be able to ride it soon. He is now 3, above average in height, and he can still barely reach and use the pedals. They are really hard to move, except maybe when going downhill. This trike may be ok for 3-4 year old, but definitely not for younger kids. So if you want a trike that your 1-2 year old will be able to use, get a different one. That said, our son did always have fun pushing it all around the yard, and sitting on it and pushing with his feet. And it's durable, after 2 years he still has not been able to destroy it. Oh and the pushing handle it definitely too low if you're tall like me!"
3,A decent buy - a little disappointing,"We bought this for our twin daughters when they turned one. At that point, we thought they would enjoy rocking on it. But, it is very hard for them to actually rock, even at 18 months. I think we made the purchase too early. I would say that by the time they can really make the toy rock, they will be big enough to ride. Mostly, they enjoy standing on the seat and pushing it around and around into walls. My suggestion - hold off until your child is two."
2,Did not like it,"With the handle my daughter would try to climb on it, each time she did this the bike would tip. Thought the handle was very unsafe. The rocking part of this toy was okay, but my daughter was at the age when was over the rocker, so didn't really use it to much. Would never use it again"
1,Read my Review. Not recommended.,Bought this for my active 2 year old son.Cons-Flimsy construction. There is a yellow pin that goes in the back to hold the push bar upright. It came loose on the first use and got wedged between two pieces of plastic crushing some of the plastic making the bar difficult to use.-Very difficult to push as your kid gets to steer which means you cannot force direction of movement.-Bar is not long enough. Have to lean way down to push.-Ended up returning item which was nearly impossible to disassemble.
2,It's OK...,"My 16 month old loves it, but I wish I ordered one that had an adjustable handle. I'm 5'5"" and have to bend over to push this, plus you can't steer it one-handed (which is nice when you want to stroll with a cup of coffee). It's fine for short distances, but Little One likes to go out for hours at a time!"
5,Fun times,My 2 year old loves this bike. He prefers to ride rather than roll and he can't yet reach the pedals to ride by himself but he scoots either way. We have to order him to put his feet up so we can push him along. It was easy to put together. Good buy for the low price.
4,My toddler loves it.,"I read all reviews on this and carefully picked this bike for my 22month old as a Christmas gift. She loves it!!!!! It is sturdy; she can reach the petals; I can push when necessary and it's not heavy. It wasn't difficult to put together at all!!! Only one small problem, you have to rock hardly because its too heavy for toddler to rock. Otherwise,it's a great toy."
3,Solid toy,"Bought this for my nephews(12mo and 3yrs at the time) for Christmas, and they've used it fairly heavily. Putting it together was a real pain. It required some drilling because some holes were missing, and not in the instructions."
3,"Rock, Roll n Ride Trike",This toy is awesome but just a one disadvantage- that is the screw on the top of the handle that fits the handle with the bottom part doesn't go inside it fully. So the screw comes out which is really very very risky for the toddlers. But apart from that this toy is really very nice and my baby is enjoying it a lot.
1,informacion del producto,buenas quiero saber q paso con este producto q aun no lo he recibido ni llego a transexpress y fue deliverado el 30 de noviembre de 2011... por favor necesito informacion....
3,Still can not assemble,"I was doing pretty good with the assembly, then got stuck. I still have not been able to put the trike together because the screw just keeps spinning without getting tighter (when trying to attach the front wheels to the body). I can not comment on the fun of the toy yet."
2,3 in 1 toy,"I bought this 2 years ago thinking my son (2years)will get to play with three toys in 1. Well,its been sitting in the garage for 2 years. It's hard to pedal."
3,"Pretty Neutral about this toy, so far.","My son has been kinda ignoring this trike, maybe cause his legs are just a bit shorter than most. The setup was pretty easy, you just need a screwdriver. I got this for more of an in between trike, something inexpensive that he can learn on before I get him that $7 schwinn that is metal. As of now this hasn't been used enought to rate."
1,Bad product and bad company,This trike won't even go together using a drill.The fork and handle piece will not screw togheter and called Fisher Price and they said Well we can't put it together for you Like I was incompentent. I'm done with this company and you have to listen to all the recall products before you can get through. Every thing from China not the same Fisher Price in the past very unprofessional
3,Happy overall,"Santa brought this bike for my 20 month old. He can't quite pedal it yet, but will be able to before long. That is why it is nice that we can push him. It is very easy to switch from rocker to push handle. Even my 5 year old could figure it out. The only bad part is that it tips easy with the handle on it. My son tipped it over and scabbed his nose. Overall we are happy with it and think it is a great first trike."
3,Expect Construction Headaches,"Like Will Jackman, I had to get out my cordless drill and drill holes in two places because the screw that secures the handlebars to the steering column went in, but then there was no threading or small hole to actually screw it into. I thought about calling Fisher Price support, but they close at 2 p.m. PST on Saturdays, it was 2:15, and I had a frantic 2 year old waiting for me to finish assembling his tricycle. So I got out my drill and made the small holes Fisher Price had obviously neglected to make.My two year old loves it and had a blast today, but I'm going to seriously think twice about buying another Fisher Price product."
5,The HIT of the Christmas toys,"We bought this trike for our granddaughter, age 2, for Christmas. When it arrived and we assembled it, it looked like so much fun, we bought another for our grandson. They were the hit gifts of Christmas! Because of space considerations, we gave it to them as a rocker. Both kids rocked with glee for hours. When they got them home, their parents changed them over to trikes ( an easy process according to them) and they are now enjoying them outside. I would highly recommend this toy!"
4,hot weather use,We bought this for our son for his 1st birthday and he loved it! the only problem we have is the handle for parents is just not long enough and in this hot humid weather that we have in florida it causes the plastic to become soft (the handle for parents) so it bends when you are trying to steer your little one around on it. love the bike overall!
4,Years of use,"We bought this for my first son four years ago. He is now five and still rides this. He even rides it together with my younger son (almost 4). This plastic tricycle is very durable, it has been thru a LOT. It rides very well on the wooden deck."
4,Worth the money but small quirks,This bike was given as a gift to my 13 month old who is now 17 mos. He loves it!! The problem I have with it is the fact that the foot rest is toooo short for him to comfortably keep his feet on it.(this is not a problem for him but for me) I have to frequently stop to put his feet on the pedals (luckily he is a tall boy. The only other thing is that he sometimes slips off. I would say that this is a pretty good toy but needs some improvements. My nephew has one he if now 4 years old and he has had it since he was a year old and he still loves it!!
4,Fisher_Price is a heavy duty product,"My son is one year 7 months. It was so easy to start padelling and using it, even my 11 years old girl is enjoying it and I don't mind it since I know Fisher_Price is heavy duty and life time purchase."
5,Great little tricycle,"I bought this last Christmas for my daughter. She was almost 2 at the time. We never used the rocking feature. She loves it and is almost 3 and still uses it.At first I would just push her slowly and she eventually figured out how to steer it. She now uses it independently, but I like having the handle there, just in case she isn't paying attention on our walks to the park and tries to drive off the sidewalk. I can also push her when her legs get tired and she just has to rest her feet on the foot rests and steer.It is very durable. It has been outside in the Arizona sun many times and is still very bright. A friend of ours has one and it is over 4 years old and still going.We got it for a steal last year, but I would buy it at the current price, knowing what I know about it."
4,Next best thing to the Big Wheel,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 1-1/2. He is now 7 and his six year old sister still rides it. The handle is a little short and the footrest is pointless. But overall this is an excellent, durable and safe toy. Good indoors and out. When my daughter was about 2 she got on and quickly flew down an incline and tipped over, only suffering a few scratches. Supervise if child cannot control it. The front wheel has finally cracked after six years which is to be expected especially if you're of the Big Wheel generation. Great toy. Highly recommended."
5,Every kid in the neighborhood loves it!,"Our child has ridden this trike since 12 mos. Every child on our street waits for the trike to be left unattended for a moment so that he/she can take a spin... and these are kids ranging in age from 1 year - 12 years, no kidding.Footrest doesn't ""lock,"" but we taught our sweetie where to put his feet and he learned.Handle could be longer (for holding the front wheel up) but that's the case with our portable stroller, too, so... (All manufacturers probably could benefit from a bit more ""real world"" product testing.) We don't even notice anymore that we used to wish the handle was longer since our little one knows where to put those sweet feet, which will be peddling soon, anyway."
5,Very Fun,"We got this for our son on his second Christmas. He was not quite 2 yet. We set it up the night before and after all the other gifts were open we brought it out to him. His smile was brilliant! He got on first and was pushing it along in our house. He loved it. We put the rocking on it but it did not rock that well on our thick carpet so he used it as a bike. Today he is almost 3 and he LOVES this toy!! We moved to FL and when we go for a walk, most times he HAS to have his bike. We take rides together as a family and he loves to keep up. The handle for the push is quite short but not shorter than umbrella strollers. Great gift that they will use for a few years at least :)."
2,Wish it were a 4-in-1...,"I KNOW that the toy NEVER claims that the child should be able to propel the toy with with their feet on the ground...but it really seems like they SHOULD be able to. My 16 month old just will not keep his feet on the little footrests, so I can't use the push function. I thought I should be able to flip up the footrest and let him use it as a ride on, but the low, wide design of the seat prevents this. His heels go under the seat and get stuck every time he tries.It took an hour or more to assemble."
4,Easy to Use; Great for Kids and Parents,"Sure, it may take a little while to put it together, but it's worth it. We put it together when our son was about 1 1/2. He climbed on it a lot but did not start to use it until he was about 2. Our wood floors started to get a little scratched so we exiled it to the driveway. Although we put it together at the second stage, his most use has been the third. The transformation was simple--didn't even need to refer to the directions.It has taken a while for our son to figure out how to use the pedals. They are a little far away. But the handle is great for us. He feels independence and the wind in his face.Cons: could use a better turning radius. A bonus would be a little trunk under the seat or storage area--kids love that stuff."
3,Versitiile but hard to steer,"If the back was more of a push/steer handle for parents it would function much better as a ""1st trike."""
4,"great toy,amazing quick delivery.","I bought this for my 1 yrs old great niece, she just loved it.Her brother is 4 yrs old wanted to ride it also,they had to take turn. The toy delivered in no time,faster thanI ever expected & for free shipping also."
4,OK,"I love the 3 stages,but the seat does not come close enough for our 15 month old grandson to feel secure when it is time to pedal. Right now he is just using it as a rocker until the warmer weather comes, and hopefully he will be a little bigger. Went together easy enough."
5,bueno,"bueno, el problema que surgió a la hora de entrega, fué solventado con exito, el envio llegó a tiempo, gracias"
1,"Beware, the push handle does not move. Difficult to direct the trike",I bought this trike for my 18 month old thinking that the push handle would be good use to take her around for a ride but the push handle does not move.Which makes it VVVV difficult to direct the bike (unless your 2 year old could ride a trike by herself and direct the handle! ..in that case you don't need a push handle:)). Not a good trike for 2 year old. Do not waste your money.
2,"Doesn't rock, the foot rest is too wobbly - was returned","We got this since this was advertised as a versatile trike and we thought what could be better? It turned out that the rocking motion is non-existent due to the way its constructed -- we tried this on a wooden as well as a carpeted surface but there was no luck. In the other position as a tricycle, it wasn't very enjoyable as well. The footrest just doesn't have a slot where it can fit in without moving about an inch front-n-back. The height was also very low for a 2 yr old as well as a 5 yr old -- the seat adjustment wasn't very helpful with that."
3,I like it in rocking mode...,My son is 18 months old. He got this for his 1 year old birthday and has enjoyed the rocking mode a lot. I took it outside for the 1st time today to give him a ride and while he absolutely loved it...I did not...I am only 5 feet tall and it was not fun pushing him. Since he controls the steering he kept turning the wheel to the left which made it really annoying on my back and in pushing in general. When he had the wheels going straight it wasn't as bad though. I will probably just keep it inside and use it only in rocker mode...My husband and Step dad are both familiar/have access to tools so assembly was very easy for them.
4,Fun for the little guys,"We have not used the toy outside because of the weather, but my 14 month old grandson enjoyed playing with it inside."
5,Perfect for all ages...,"We bought this for my son first birthday gift.Since you can convert it in 3 different configuration, he was able to hop on right away and have hours of fun!We use it indoor and outdoor and he simply loves it.Highly recommended, also note that this is not part of the large national recall from Fisher Price, this product is safe even when my kid decide to do some maintenance and flip it upside-down to spin the wheels as fast as they can possible go!Shop safe, this is an awesome product, Amazon beat Toys r Us on prices everyday."
2,Front wheel broke twice.,"I purchased this trike for our 3 year old son. He really enjoyed riding it, but the front wheel broke twice. Granted, my son was a bit rough on the bike and liked to run into things, but it should not have broken so quickly. We replaced the bike and the same thing happened. The wheel actually went flat on one side. He still liked to ride it, broken wheel and all."
3,Nice starter tricycle,"Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase. I love being able to push the toy when needed. I am, however, a little disappointed that the seat and/or pedals do not adjust for my child's shorter legs. The seat moves forward and backward, but it does not move far enough up for my son to keep his feet on the pedals. My son still loves the toy though. I also wish there was a way to lock the handle bars in a straight position, so the toy would be easier to push (without a rider to steer) when we're out somewhere and my son decides he wants to walk. We haven't had this toy for very long yet, but it seems quite durable and easy to clean. I would recommend this toy."
3,Short foot rests,"We bought this for our 10 month old daughter to push her around. Obviously her legs couldn't reach the foot pedals, so we tried to get her to use the foot rests. They were way too short! She's now 16 months and still has problems using the footrest. I suppose a child doesn't know to hold in their feet to use the footrest. If it was a little wider I think it would help.Another problem I found is that this ride on needed a seat belt.We don't use this toy at all."
1,NOT recommended,"I can't believe that people find this thing durable! It is so cheap. The foot rest does not stay ""locked"" into position for my baby's feet, so they drag on the ground. The handle used to push the trike does not lock, so it's near impossible to push the thing. And this thing does not ""rock"". He's too young to ride it as a trike, so I hope that it is worth it once he can ride it himself. Until then it will get dusty in our basement."
5,"Rock, Roll'n Ride Trike Really Rocks",Bought it for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. It is so versatile and changes into so many things. Her baby brother will get it next!
3,Not what I expected,"This toy did take a little while to put together. I bought it for my 20 month old and he was really excited about it when it arrived. He loves anything that rolls. I wanted to be able to push him on it but the handle does not FIRMLY lock in place in the upright position preventing you from being able to lift the front wheel if needed to go over a curb. Also, without a lock for the front wheel I cannot take him on a walk as he is driving all over the place. I think once he knows how to pedal it will make a great trike but as far as the first two steps goes I give it two thumbs down."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this for my 16 month old because of the 3 in 1 combination. As a rocker he loves it although it doesn't rock very much. As far as pushing him with the handle, thats a joke. First of all the steering wheel is controlled by the kid so if he turns it just slightly you're running into the grass. My arms are so sore from trying to keep it on the sidewalk. Also the pin that keeps the handle up jiggles out so I had to keep pushing it back in. I must have stopped four times in 15 minutes just to put the pin back in. Also since the pin comes out so easily, my son likes to sit behind the bike and pull the pin right out- in which case the handle then cracks him on the head! The foot rests are also terrible. They don't stay locked in place and when they come unlocked my son's feet get stuck under the bike which then makes it tip. The foot rests aren't very big to start with and he has a hard time fitting his feet on them in the first place. Overall I would say avoid this toy."
4,Great trike!,"I got this for my 14 month old for Christmas. He didn't care for it so much to rock - but now at 16 months loves ""riding"" it outside while I push. Would recommend this toy!"
4,Easy assemble and fun for the kids,Bought this product for my nephew and he loved it. The peddles are not that great and keep slipping but I would still recommend this product. Its a great gift for 2 yr old!
2,Better Choices Out There,"Purchased this for a 2 year old in November 2012. The whole item is made from plastic. The best feature is the rocking option. When using the rocking option it is best to use on carpet or rug, becuase on tile or hardwood the bike starts sliding. Now as a bike...we set it up with the guiding handle, figured this would be great for walks on the neighborhood. At 5'4, this handle is a good height, but not reliable at all. You cannot steer direction, just back and forth. Again, the handle is plastic and not very sturdy. One thing I did like about the guiding handle is since our two year old was new to riding bikes it served as a safety back rest when needed.Using the bike indoors was fine, but on the street or sidewalk the plastic wheels felt as if they were going to crack. The front wheel and handle bars are also a bit tight and not easy for a child to steer. Tested other bikes and various brands were a lot better."
5,Still using it,"We bought this trike for our oldest in 2005. He used it, our second used it, our third used it (more than the other 2 combined), and we plan to have our fourth use it. The wheels are sturdy, but will slip on dirt or pebbles, just like our big wheels did. I love that the seat is adjustable and you can teach your child to pedal by pushing him along with the kickin' spoiler. I don't know if they still make this trike, but if they do, buy it! You won't be sorry."
3,design problems,Got this as X-mas gift for my 2 year old girl. Trike fork and handle screw is too small in diameter. The drilled hole is too big will not fit. Called customer service will take 14 days to ship new fork and handle assembly. Too late for Xmas time. Will be pleasantly surprised if the other set fits the screw. BUYER BEWARE!!! Bad assembly flaw. Can not rate other attributes at this time.P.S. Fixed with #12x3 sheet metal screw with same head and thread size bought at ace hardware...Power drill was no use there was nothing to drill into the screw was too short after putting it into the handle and the fork.
4,toddler LOVES it,"My toddler received this for Christmas shortly after turning 2. He begs every day to go ride his bike. Of corse, that means us pushing him, but he has a blast. Unfortunately, its no match for a Ford F250. We'll be buying another this Christmas...."
4,Good trike,My son really likes this trike he is 22 months and he is a little small for but he enjoys it anyway.
5,My little Devyn loves this toy...,I could not beleive how much Devyn who just turned 1 loved his new little toy..
4,This is the best thing I bought for my son.....,"This bike was easy to put together, and it's VERY SAFE AND STURDY. I did have a little problem putting the handle bar on, the hole for the screw was a little off, all I did was just drill another hole and it works perfectly. We tested out several trikes at Toy'R'Us and this was the ONLY ONE that didn't tip over every time he got on and off of it. Right now he is at the pushing age, and if your tall person this would be hard to push because the handle is on the short side. My son LOVES it, so this gets 4 stars, the only reason it doesn't 5 stars because there are some improvements they could make."
2,"Fun, but be careful about rock and ROLL OVER","this toy serves multiple purposes, and both my kids enjoy it very much.But recent accident made me re-think about it. Basiclly, my daughter rock-roll it too hard (she is less than 2 year old), and it fall/flip backwards. She landed on her head and was really hurt. She is ok now, but refuse to use it again after that. I admit I should be watching her, but this is sth need to be considered.Also want to mention is that it is not that durable. Pieces of plastic was falling out from the front wheel. It looks like a tube with holes on it."
2,Disappointed,This was the first Fisher Price toy that I was disappointed with.Assembly itself is time consuming and cannot be accomplished without drilling extra holes as other reviews state.The handle bar is not stable.Additionally there is no seat belt and so the child can fall off as has occurred with mine.I would not recommend this product for smaller kids.In hind sight I wish I had put in the extra money and purchased the Little Tikes 3 in one trike.
5,"Rock, Roll 'N Ride Trike","Well can't say how fun it is, I'm a little big for it. HahahaThe product arrived prompt & Fisher-Price has an excellent product, I'm sure the Granddaughter will love her Christmas present."
4,trike,"I bought this for our son's birthday, he just turned 2 years old. Although he can't pedal the trike yet (he can reach pedals but legs not long enough to actually pedal- he is 37 inches tall), he hops on and rocks for a while which is why I chose this trike- it's too cold here to be outside anyway. We;ve only had for a month and haven't taken it on the road yet, but it seems sturdy enough. My only complaint is that the handle keeps falling down, so I think we'll have to rig something to keep it up- but I don't think he'll need it very long anyway!"
4,3 in 1??? NOT... but here is the real deal,"OKAY! As experienced parents,we know that the multi-use items, never do one thing- really well. The 3,4,5 in 1's never quite do all that they claim. And this is no different. The ""rocker"" feature is just really stupid. It doesn't do anything. As a push trike, it will fit the bill, for sure. It has respectable durability, and is gender neutral. So for me, it's a great great value. I have toddler, boy and girl. As a stand alone trike, this is a perfect ""starter"" big wheel. The assembly was straight forward, just follow the directions to the letter, all 14 of the steps- do really matter. You need to understand the mechanics of the bike, to really ""get"" how to convert. Once you are all set, you have a quick and inexpensive alternative, to a metal bike. For a starter bike, this will do just fine, for your little one(s). The price was good, for the value."
3,Serious Assembly required,"I just assembled this for my two year old.Be prepared when you unpack it, you will discover that all you have recieved is a box full of parts.You will be the proud owner of 31 plastic parts hat come with 25 screws for assembly.I am a mechanic and don't mind putting things together but other shoppers might be displeased."
2,don't buy if your tall!!!,we got this for our 1 year old. I know it says from 18 months but we thought he could at least use the rock feature. WRONG! It doesn't even rock. A tiny back and forward motion but no means is he entertained by it. It's not curved enough. Then we though ok lets try him outside. Disaster! My husband and i had a very sore back in the matter of minutes. No long walks with this. The adult handle needs to be MUCH higher. Also the foot rest kept flicking backwards so his feet would go on the floor. I'm dissapointed overall. Wasted my money.
4,Overall good product,My one year old daughter really likes this toy. It is great aa a rocker. The only flaw I should mention is that the handle to push this thing does not really work. It doesn't lock into place very well so if you are not pushing forward it folds down easily and you cannot steer it. But as a rocker and then eventually a bike I think it works great and would recommend it. Just don't take the babies out for a walk on it and think you can push them.
4,"Fun toy, but parent push is too much like a stroller","My son loves this bike. He's almost 2 and can't quite reach the pedals when the bike turns, but he just pushes himself around. It was easy to put together and seems durable. The reason I purchased this bike was for the parent push handle. I've tried a couple times to put the handle on and push him and when I do that he doesn't want to ride. I guess it makes it feel more like a stroller than a bike because its such a big handle. Also, the handle has to be screwed on with 2 other parts so its a pain to do it. Overall, I like the bike and my son does too, but if I had to do it over I wouldn't worry about the parent pushing handle and just get a cheaper one sans that handle."
5,"Rock , Roll, and Ride","I just purchased the Rock, Roll and Ride for a little friend of mine who just turned 2. He's a small 2 but can reach the pedals. He's using it right now in the ""Rock"" mode. I gave the bike a 4 for durability and educational because I just gave it to him, so only time will tell.The only problem I/he has with it, are the buttons that you push for ""Rock, Roll or Ride"" are way to hard for him to push, let alone hold till it kicks in. I always have to push on it for him and it's not that easy for me, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm not sure if it's a fluke or that's the way it is. I'm thinking about returning it, or exchanging it for that reason.All in all it's a great hit for him and his twin brothers! It took time to put it together but was easy!"
1,bad quality product,"We got it for $50 and it's not worth it. First of all, it had manufacturing defect in handle and we had to borrow drill machine to get it fixed. Then it had few holes on tyres. We thought it might be some manufacturing feature, but when I took the cycle outside, more holes created during first outing itself. We even did not took out kid on road, only a little ride on sideway. Then I returned it immediately.Would not recommend to buy."
1,Pretty useless,"I was swamped by all the good reviews.However this toy quickly proved its uselessness - at most it can be used a a rocking toy.Wheels are uncomfortable, the seat cracked right away.Cannot be used as a bike in any position of the seat - uncomfortable either way.Stay away."
2,Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation,"Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the fourth Lara Croft adventure game based entirely in Egypt. A very long and challenging game built on a nice engine with great graphics, Neat animations and neat sound effects. Good storyline and great gameplay with infinite saves. Awesome lighting effects and a creepy atmosphere. Great puzzles but a lot of annoying false paths. Very challenging gameplay but can be too challenging at times because no difficuly option. Good level design with a helpfull training level, But the hub level layout is very confusing and easy to get lost. A Lot of fun doing all the jumping but the controls are as usual very badly done, Auto aim is not perfect and the manual aiming is impossible. Enemy AI is super dumb. Tomb Raider Last Revelation well deserves 4 stars but i will give it only 2 because it does not have good key controls and a difficulty option."
5,"Very hard, but very fun.","I'd have to say that this is the hardest 'Tomb Raider' game since the first, but it's also the most fun. Sure the Egyptian bulls are trying to kill you, while you jump out of their way so you can make them break buttons for your escape. And mummies are after you while you are trying to vacate the Burial Chambers, but that's only the first few levels. It gets alot more intense and creepy, but alot more fun. I finally won the game after a few months of playing, but hey, if I won it, anyone can."
5,I Hope you like the creepy undead... They're EVERYWHERE!,"Being a big fan of the Tomb Raider Series, I bought the Millenium Editon of this game near when it first came out. When I played it, the graphics were stunning. Lara looked great, as always, but I think she looked better in Tomb Raider II and III. Nevertheless, she is still visually pleasing sue to the single-skin technology given to her(meaning, her arms and legs do not look disconnected). My main problem with this game are the enemies and the difficulty level. An adjustable level of difficulty, maybe from easy to hard, would have been great for beginners and people who wanted a full challenge... but oh well. If you don't like to deal with mummies, crusader skeletons, zombies, and ghosts, forget it. That's the main theme you have to encounter, and it will freak out sqeamish gamers such as myself. Otherwise, sit back and play Tomb Raider 2, the most ""live"" game there is."
5,Tomb Raider The Last Revelation,"I have been a big fan of the Tomb Raider series and this is the best one yet. Yes like the others buying the guide is a must, but the games I like the most are the ones that require some thought. I will usually go back to those games again, and again, because I am less likely to get bored with them. In this one I find as I go along that I need the guide less and less. There is a learning curve in the game that makes it more fun then the past Tomb Raiders. Of course the graphics are wonderful and I like the darkly lit areas, they help make the game more suspensfull"
1,Never Gets Old??,"It sure does. Old, boring, hard to play and hard to control. This game is more fun than a sharp stick to the eye but not by much. And the price when it first came out! Sheesh! I'm betting that the only reason some people buy this is Lara's chest and that does'nt justify purchasing this accident of a game."
1,I HATE IT!,"... Lara was too slow and it was hard to use the controls.I liked all of the Tomb Raider games better than this one. The only thing I liked about this game were the graphics. The graphics were the best I have seen yet.I am sooo glad that I decided to rent it instead of buying first! Before you waste your money on this game, go rent it first, to see if you like it."
4,Fun and frustrating,"Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is a lavishy designed game. The game starts out from 16 year old Lara. The game is based on real places in Egypt. The graphics are great. The A.I are also more intelligent. After every stage there is a great movie to watch...it's like watching the "" Mummy "" ! In the game , Lara awakes Set and now must savethe world before the year 2000. Many interesting puzzles with one mistake: While solving these puzzles you may have to go to the previous stage to push a button or something...this makes it so frustrating...you will never know when the levels ends ! And I agree, this game is impossible to complete without a guide or cheat codes...but still the storyline is great...Get it to celebrate the closing of 1,000 years !"
1,It sucks,"It has good graphics..so what?. This is the most upsetting game i've ever played, it is not fun at all because of the simple fact that is IMPOSSIBLE to win, they set you up in places where you can't get through without using all of your health kits and most places require a hint book to be played, it is really boring and it sucks. The worst part is that i keep playing cause i'm not gonna let this stupid game to make me resign. If i ever met the guy who created this piece of crap i would punch him in his nose for making me waste 40 U$. Save your money for something else."
1,VERY disappointing...,"As fairly avid gamers, I have to point out that this is only the second game we've refused to finish due to a rapidly-escalating frustration level. I enjoyed the original TR, skipped the middle two, and hoped to recapture the fun with TR4, but no luck. Play Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine instead -- a MUCH better game."
1,The PC version DO NOT execute in Windows 98.,"My review simply is: DON'T BUY! Not on the PC!At least not until Eidos has issued a better patch to download on their website The present patch does not correct the fundamental problem:An instant game termination as soon as it is installed in the Autorun. The autorun works fine but the Setup doesn't and the Play doesn't.The game generates a Memory Page Fault exception and thus is unacceptable as a Windows application.There is no game to play on the CD-ROM and until Eidos have corrected that it is a waste of money.I have complained to Eidos themselves using the technical support e-mail. Hopefully a patch will arrive soon. Until then: Can't recommend, fellows."
4,Al Green's Greatest Hits,"I played it on election day when Obama won.....As my Mom said, ""He almost sounds as good as the President""....."
1,Broken,"Came broken on arrival. This is designed to hook on the back of the fat PS2, but when I hooked it up, only the audio played. It's also heavy."
2,good when it works.,This works really good and is easy to use but sometimes it just goes black and doesn't work for awhile. I'd recomend something else.
2,unsatisfactory,"It is a nice screen but does not have a very good color display, you have to keep changing it every time a different screen comes on to see certain objects that are on the games."
1,STILL WAITING,IT HAS BEEN 24 DAYS AND 2 HOURS THAT MY CREDIT CARD WAS BILLED AND I STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY ORDER! NOT EVEN AN UPDATE OF MY ORDER!
1,HUH!! PLAY ANYWHERE????,COLOR GAME SCREEN IS ADVERTISED TO BE PLAYED ANYWHERE. HUH. IF YOU CAN FIND THE CAR ADAPTER. WE PURCHASED THIS SCREEN FOR [price] AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PS CAR ADAPTER FOR PS ONE WILL FIT FOR THE PS TWO. WE PAID AN ADDITIONAL [money] FOR THE CAR ADAPTER. LOW AND BEHOLD WE GET IN THE CAR FOR A TWO HOUR CAR TRIP AND THE PS ONE CAR ADAPTER DOES NOT FIT!!!!!!! SO WE CAN NOT PLAY IT ANYWHERE!! DOES ANYONE EVEN SELL THE CAR ADAPTER FOR PS 2 GAME SCREEN. FOR THE KIND OF MONEY WE SPEND ON THE PS PLAYSTATION PLUS THE PRICE OF GAMES PLUS THE GAME SCREEN YOU WOULD THINK THE COMPANY WOULD THROW IN A STUPID CAR ADAPTER SO AS ADVERTISED WE COULD PLAY ANYWHERE. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE TO BUY A CAR ADAPTER FOR PS 2 GAME SCREEN...
1,Never got the item within the said time,"Under availability, it says ships withing 1-2 days. It has been a week and isn't expected to be shipped for another two weeks. I am cancelling and will not order from here again. I know it sounds impatient, but I don't have the time. I am deployed to a combat location. I won't be here long enough............OH WELL."
3,Works in a pinch,"I have a job that includes a lot of travel and I am an online game nut. I bought this because many of the hotels are stopping gamers from connecting to the tv. This screen works in a pinch, but really wish you could see a little better. Very difficult to get around in a role playing adventure. But, if you have no alternative, this beats nothing."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"... First of all this screen costs abous -money amount]! The first day I got this screen I pluged it in, and it worked fine for about a hour until this black line showed up across the 5in (very small) screen. So now there is a big black line across the middle, and it driving me crazy. The only thing that saved me was that I bought a warranty from [local store]. So I went to return this screen and got a second. After about 2 good hours of play this screen is completly busted. Now I;m really [upset] this is my second screen in less than three days. My advice to you is to save your money and buy a couple good games. Along side the [money amount]for the screen you have to fork over another [money amount] fo all of the power adapters for you car. Please take this advice."
2,Not as good as the 5.0 screen,"I got this for my son for Christmas because he has wanted one since he played with his uncle's PS2 screen. Well, I guess I didn't take enough time to read all of the reviews and if I had never seen the 5.0 screen would probably have been satisfied with the 5.4. However, since I have seen the 5.0 screen, this 5.4 screen was a HUGE disappointment. The quality is no where near that of the 5.0. I took it to a store the day after Christmas to exchange for something else (at my son's request who was also unhappy with the quality). Don't buy it!"
3,Tough little space saver,"Currently serving in Afghanistan, I am in Army Aviation. We spend a huge amount of time on missions, and sometime's we're forced to sleep on our helicopters. We cant bring things like TVs with us on the birds, but this little screen fit right in my flight bag along with my slim model PS2. At least it is something for those crappy nights spent in the middle of nowhere. The resolution isnt bad at night, but the screen is too small for some games. But it's better than nothing, and the sand and rough rides dont seem to phase it at all. I'm really happy with this product."
4,no ac dc adapter,I think that the screan should come with an ac dc adapter insted of us having to buy all that stuff to play it in the car all I want to do is have a littel fun in the car on a trip with out having to spend a bunch of money.
4,Ps2 Gaming Screen,This product is very useful(in most cases).Its really good for traveling or just in the car bored.The screen pops right on and away you go.My favorite game to play on it is Contra Shattered soldier because it brightens up the screen so you can see wats going on.i give this product 2 thumbs up because sometimes u just need to play ur ps2 and with this you can play anywhere.
1,don't buy it,this product is not a good product.the manufactors and producers didn't do that good of a job while making it.the screen is not good at all and the sound stinks to. you can't take it anywhere without having a ac adapter like for me i fly a lot and i would like to be able to take it with me but i have to settle with my portable dvd player.what i'm trying to say is that this product is not good a all. i give this one star down.hope i helped you!!!
2,I wouldnt buy it yet unless....,i wouldnt buy this item yet beacuse you can get a 19' tv for the same price. But you might want to check for this item later because it should have a D/C adapter so you can play it in your car soon.
4,It is pretty good it is useful to me,The screen is a little small but you can see what is going on it is a little less perfect around the edges. I can play dvd's where ever I go. It does require to power plugs I am currently trying to find an alternative to make it truly a mobile monitor.
4,Piece of junk!,"Do not get this! It is awful, it says the picture is TV like quality, don't fall for it. The picture is grainy, and you can't see from more than one angle. Don't wast your $150!I recomend Intech's 5"" LCD screen, which has great quality, they don't sell them anymore so you have to get it used. But its worth it. BE CAREFULL, DON'T GET THE 5.4""!"
3,not bad,"i bought this screen for my deployment in the sandbox and this is what i have to say on it:this screen is not bad.i'm not saying it's good ... but it's not bad.for one, 5.6"" is too small for me. two, the headphone jack has a nasty hisssss on the background. three, it looks fragile.and if you think that this thing can substitute for a portable DVD player, think again. it's anything but portable.the brightness/contrast/color problem went away after having the screen turned on for 10-15 minutes."
2,hard to control color and bad all around quality,I bought this screen with high hopes of it being as good as the sony PS One screen. the color is hard to get just right for playing games. It was eather to bright or too dull. I would wait for the sony screen to come out for better quality.
1,Avid ps2 player,"My husband and I are avid PS2 players. I was so excited when I bought this screen, it was a surprise present. I was disappointed. I did not mind the size of the screen. What I did not like was the quality of the screen, very bad resolution. We played a DVD movie and could not see it on the screen."
1,Screen problems Galor!!,Well I thought this would be a good thing to have for taking trips. You do need a power converter. ... The main problem I have is that if you play games for more than ten minutes and then switch games the screen goes nuts. It gets all squiggly like the vertical or horizontal is messed up. The only way that it goes back to normal is to leave it off for ten minutes. I have written to the company and have gotten no response about this. .... As it stands now I have wasted my money on this item. ...
2,The Slim PS2's screen is bigger,"First of all, I don't want people to think I hate this screen. The quality is off the charts, but when compared to the screen of the slim PS2, it just plain sucks. The quality of the two screens is about the same, but the slim PS2's screen is about 5 inches bigger than the normal PS2's screen. So, if you don't have a slim PS2, then buy this one. But if you do have a slim PS2, then you wouldn't have to worry about this in the first place."
1,Playstation 2 Games screen,"THIS THING [Stinks]!!! I've exchanged it twice now and I still can't get the s-video to come in color(only black&white?). This picture is fuzzy and hard to see at any angle but directly on. And why is it not wide screen? It does sound decent though, and has a somewhat innovative design. My suggestion? Wait for the interact 5.4"" monitor for PS2!"
1,No Question about it!,"Haha 150 bucks are you kidding me. What a waste. This is ridiculous. Yes I am too poor to buy a tv so im going to buy a small LCD screen for 150 dollars, pathetic. You can plainly tell from the product and the character on the screen of the product this is a shi*ty a*s item. Instead buy a small tv. Or buy Final Fantasy X that doesn't require a tv. Just requires a small brain."
4,Fine account of these brave soldiers.,"The rousing history of the Ghurkas & their wonderful achievements are meat & drink for an author like Farwell & he certainly doesn't disappoint here. Good mix of general military history together with plenty of first hand, personal accounts of Ghurka bravery & quirkiness. These are a special people & this is a fascinating story of how their 200+ years of loyal service to the British Crown's Armed Forces came about &, sadly, ended on pretty poor terms. Recommended!"
5,A good book about some stouthearted soldiers,"Most Mercenary Troops are not what you would call top drawer people. Most having the most pressing reason not to hang around home. The reason usually involving a Woman or a Noose. Some of these outfits are noted for their draconian discipline like the Foreign Legion or the German Penal battalions of WWII. I would of not wanted to of been an officer or Non Com in those units. The Ghurkhas are another story and its a great story. From their war with ""John Company"" in 1815 to the present, The Gurkhas have set a very high standard indeed. As an example,It was a sight to see at Buckingham Palace in watching them mount Guard in place of the Guards. I just can't picture the Legion doing the same job in Paris. Of all the Regimental stories I have read so far this is near the top of the list. Mr. Farwell has done his usual good job of telling a good story about Englands Army and her late Empire."
4,Gurkhas,"I really liked it. It is not easy to find books on this topic, grab them when you get the chance."
3,A bit disappointing,"Well, not was I was looking for. I would like to find something more than a description of what modules do, and that's mostly what it does. The last chapter is a smorgasbord of light descriptions of modules such as Text::Balanced, which have little or nothing to do with parsing, or with pro, and the chapter on XML processing looks like just a filler with little to add to the rest of the book or to the literature on XML+Perl."
4,"A little over my head, but that's OK","Some of this was a little over my head. I'm ""ok"" with regular expressions, but when it gets into grammars, I'm a little weak and have some room to grow. That's OK: I know I need to learn more in this area. After all, what's the point of a book if it doesn't help you grow?I liked that this introduced and explained parsing related CPAN modules that I otherwise might have been afraid to touch (CPAN is a great resource, but there's so much there that it intimidates those of us who aren't real Perl experts).The examples generally related to things I do every day, so that was helpful. I'll need to spend more time in the grammar sections, and try out some of the CPAN modules, but this book is a definite keeper."
4,Very good introduction to Parsing in General,Really enjoyed reading this book and am impressed by the simple way in which author could explain broad subject of parsing and language grammars. The examples are very simple to follow through and the best resource till date I have seen in explaining this complex topic in the simplest way possible. I write little bit of code in perl but largely am very impressed with built in bias and strength of the language towards parsing and data processing tasks.Worth reading for anyone.
3,WHERE'S THE NEW YORK ACCENT?,"In Adelaides Lament, she is supposed to say ""poison"" instead of person! but in this one she say Person! I liked the accent in the very first track bettah!"
1,Make sure this is what you want!,"I bought this CD under the impression that it would be a normal rendition of Guys and Dolls. I did not see that Motown produced it and I am very disappointed with the CD overall. Guys and Dolls is a classic musical, and to change the beats and remove the accents is a crime. If you are a classic musical lover do not buy this. It is not normal."
5,"Best Recording There Is of ""Guys and Dolls""","I had the good fortune of actually seeing this production of ""Guys and Dolls"" and it was -- as this recording demonstrates -- flawless in its execution, and it remains the best version of ""Guys and Dolls"" ever produced. This album is a timeless presentation of Frank Loesser's music that is always fresh -- and often both hilarious and deeply moving. I am a scholar in the field of the Broadway Musical, and I have, quite frankly, rarely in my life seen a show this good. It was so good that I contacted the producer to try and get it saved on video on PBS, but they did not have the TV rights, which was tragic. Don't miss this cast recording. Every song is a demonstration of true excellence."
4,The great plague,"I love a good book and OMG the book was good! Not only did it say about the great plague, but it also said about the fire of London. The author started off with just the plague, but then added in about the fire. So awesome."
5,a new favorite!,"I bought this tool for 2 trade handymen and they loved it. I was hoping that it wasn't too gimicky, and it wasn't percieved that way at all. They both felt that they could use this tool in many difficult applications."
5,Great tool to have around the house,I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift and have used it as much as he has. This is a great tool to add to your tool collection.
5,?refund,Even though I am not under 13 I could not find any other place to contact you. I ordered this product and I received 2. One under my name and one under my mothers name. I mailed mine back to you on 12-8-06 and there was never a credit issued back on my credit card. I haave the amazon recipt please contact me and let me know why I have not received this. I got the return shipping label from your web site so I haave no receipt for shipping it back to you. Please contact me!
4,Black & Decker has a winner here!,"I purchased the black & decker wrench for my husband's birthday after seeing the commercial on tv. My husband is a police officer and has used it to take tags off of cars. He has been very pleased with how it works. I was a little wary at first because to me black & decker seemed to be losing it's reputation for having a good solid product over the last few years. I hope the adjustable wrench is a sign of a upwards turnaround. Just put the jaws around the bolt's head and push the button and it automatically closes so all you do it twist it off. Great idea with a good solid construction. The only negative thing I have to say is it seems a little pricey to me, but I know tools are usually costly anyway so it probably is right for this tool but I think it could be a little cheaper. I did get a good buy off of amazon with a 1/2 off deal was still $25. However, I would recommend it for it's uses and quality."
3,"Pretty good, but...","It was a great concept, but the battery has died very quickly. Would have hoped for better from Black and Decker."
2,Not For Me,This type of wrench is good for the apartment or in a ladies tool kit. NOT for the mechanic or outside work. Battery drains overnight when it gets cold. No power and bulky. My wife got it for me as a christmas gift. I liked it at first until I went to use it. Not worth the money.
1,Waste of money,"I have this tool but never use it. The switch to open or close it is in a bad place, just when you get ready to use it you accidently open the wrench as the switch is easily pushed. It also does not grip tight at all. It is useless in my opinion and a total waste of money. It looked like a good idea but isn't."
1,Piece if junk.,It quit working after 3 uses so I took it apart to see what happened. This thing has a rubber belt that does the opening and closing of the jaws. The belt broke after the 3 uses.It gets a one star because I can't post with no star checked.
1,Wrench is a joke...,"My wife gave this to ma about 1 1/2 years ago...I have yet to use it...I've tried, but to me, it's a joke."
2,The No grip Wrench,"It wasn't really what I thought it was going to be, the adjustable part works fine but the closing end has no teeth."
1,waste of money,I own this wrench and it is a waste of money. It runs off of AAA batteries that can't even power the jaws back and forth without assistance. You might as well spend the money this thing costs on a good wrench and save yourself the headache.
2,"Nice idea, not a durable tool.","Got one for Christmas, used it for one project, installing gas lines in the basement. Wrench fell off the ladder and that was it, no more auto wrench.The good part, returned this to a B&D; store, they sent me 3 wrenches as a replacment.I'll be more careful with the replacements, but, this is not a regular tool, have to be careful with it.I would not have bought this myself, nothing beats a good Craftsman open end wrench. I'll find a use for it."
5,Loved it,I bought the wrench for my son whose very busy but I had the chance to use it while doing some remodeling in his house. It worked great for me. I found it to be so handy and easy to use. I'm going to get one for myself.
1,not happy,I purchased this item for a gift for my husband. Unfortunately he doesn't think much of it and I will be sending it back.
1,A real review - no hipe - tool is a joke,"I was at first excited to get this tool, but disappointment quickly set in. It's not all these other reviews hype it up to be. It's big and bulky and the batteries drain slowly. Went to use it the other day, and it was dead, and I haven't used it all that much."
1,Not a useful tool,"I bought this wrench because it looks so innovative. When I had it in my hands, I realized that my assumption was wrong. The reasons are:1. The switch is at an awkward location. My thumb is not there when I grab the wrench.2. The power of the motor is too weak. So there is no feeling that the jaw is tightened.3. The shape of the handle is far from ergonomic. It usally slips out from hand.4. Overall size is too bulky. So it is not agile enough.One day, there must be an occasion when this wrench can be helpful (I hope), so I just keep it."
1,What a waste,"This is the second ""Auto"" tool that I got from B&D that just sucks. It just doesn't tighten enough to be of any use. I can understand the safety issues of why it won't close too tight in case it is used on something like a finger, but in order to tighten a nut and bolt, you need something to tighten on that, and this just doesn't."
1,Do not waste your money!!,"This wrench has internal parts of poor quality. The mechanicsm is driven off a small rubber belt. Mine worked approximately 3 weeks. Then, when the button to move the jaw was used, the motor would run but no jaw movement. I removed the screws from the plastic casing to find the belt had broke in two pieces. It appeared to be dry-rotted. It is a cheep internal part that, when breaks, renders the entire tool no more valuable than the $5 crescent wrench from Walmart. Don't waste your money."
1,useless toy,I dont ever review items but i had to let the amazon family knowThis wrench does not have enough power to tighten the jaws so if you use it you still have to manually tighten in the end for it to work.So what i have is a fun toy that the jaws move back and forth with a push of a button.You would be much better served with a cheap adjustable wrench.I will keep it. I collect adjustable wrenches (I know i'm weird) just not use it.
3,Cool,only got to use this a couple times until it was stolen from me..it did work very well and was very easy to use
1,Not so good!,"I was very surprised that Black & Decker would make a tool that is this bad. They are a very old company and usually you can count on quality products from them. I bought this wrench for use around my ranch as a ""do all"" for light work. I thought I would use it for maybe holding nuts or bolts while I used a quality ratchet or wrench to do the ""power"" work. This thing does not tighten up enough to prevent slipping even under the slightest pressure. It also seems to have a mind of it's own when it comes to staying closed on a nut or bolt. It will open up when slight pressure is applied. I'm not sure if I want to keep it or not. Ralph"
2,Good idea But...,"I bought into the novelty of this tool. It is cool to show off, but my most common use for a c-wrench is holding a nut while tightening a bolt head on the other side. The biggest annoyance is having the c-wrench slip off or slipping off while using alot of force (ouch!). These stuations are where this tool is no better than a regular c-wrench. Luckily i found a c-wrench w/ a vise grip! Its made be Stanley and also on amazon. If only they could combine these two ideas for the perfect c-wrench."
1,NO GRIPPING POWER,"I do NOT recommend this product at any price as it has no gripping power at all and is a waste of money. The concept is great, but that is all.."
1,Do Not Buy,I never received this item. I ordered it before Christmas and was notified two weeks after it should have arrived that I would not be receiving it. Do Not buy from this seller.
2,Adjustment motor too weak,"Cool tool in concept, but I was really disappointed at how weak the motor is that opens and closes the wrench. You have to pretty much turn it horizontal to get it to move the jaws at all. I ordered two. Maybe they both came with dead batteries, but I doubt it... Too bad."
4,Nice,This was a Christmas gift for a real Mr. Fix-It. It was a wonderful buy. I hope Mr. Fix-It likes it. It's a great idea for anyone.
2,Eh,Batteries were dead when it arrived.Unit does not have a smooth operationSize calibration which is a good idea so as to know what the size is of what you are wrenching is impossible to read because there is no contrast to the body colot
5,favorite tool,"This wrench is excellent. I use it more than any other wrench or pliers. As long as it has good batteries in it, the automatic function is so cool, plus it can ge used as a normal credential wrench should you find yourself with dead batteries. Best purchase ever!"
2,Poor Quality,"I seen these and thought it was a cool idea, but once I received the tool it was obvious that it wasn't meant to be used for anything much but very light duty if anything. It's more like a toy."
4,Very clever.,"You don't realize how helpful this is until you have been into some tight places, twisting and turning. One time I decided to replace my sink faucet. I was lying down, looking up and it was something. Adjusting and then slipping, adjusting again was a real pain, if I was not already in pain in that difficult position. And when I saw this and played with it at Tar-J, I thought it is very clever.It runs on 2 triple A's batteries. Push button operation. Just don't expect those batteries to adjust it real tight for you. It will open and then close it just snug, and then it is your job to tighten it with a twist of your thumb. Max size is 1-1/3"".OK it is not a Snap-On, but still it is a decent tool from a decent manufacturer. Run out of battery? No, problem it also works like a regular manual adjustable wrench if it needs be."
1,Black & Decker AAW100 8-Inch Auto Wrench,"This is not a $500 wrench. Something is terribly wrongwith the price, or terribly wrong with the vendor's senseof ethics. Try 29.95."
4,Christmas present,I recently purchased this as a Christmas present and the recipient has been very happy with it. The delivery was prompt and product was as advertised.
3,Ok,"This seems to work ok most of the time. It hangs up occasionally. Mine has a little ""play"" in the gear that closes the wrench. Good idea, time will tell if it holds up to bigger jobs. My husband has his doubts, but is willing to give it a chance. Ok buy at $24 price range. Full price too much."
1,Dumb Concept,"My mother got me one of these as a christmas gift.It's gotta be the dumbest idea to come along in a while. A battery powered wrench? The last thing I want to have to worry about with a hand tool is a dead battery. Hand tools need to be reliable, and you don't want to have to go searching for a battery when it dies. Yes you can use it as a manual adjustable wrench, and that's what you'll end up doing when the battery dies and you are sick of replacing it. So why not just go buy a good adjustable in the first place.The other thing is that the open/close switches get bumped and triggered a lot in close quarters. Annoying.And the world doesn't need yet another battery powered gadget so we can generate more batteries for the landfills.Dumb.Maybe B&D; should focus on just making decent power tools instead of the glorified toys they sell, stop with the geewhiz mutants like this."
1,This wrench is a POS,Con's:1. bulkier than a regular cresent wrench it is supposed to replace2. harder to use the manual adjustment than a regular cresent3. stopped working after a month / used 3 timesPlease do yourself or someone you are buying for a favor and don't buy this POS.
5,TOOLTIME,"EXCELLENT TOOL.CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT CAME WITH A BATTERY,BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT.AMAZON CAME THROUGH FINE AS USUAL. GREAT SITE TO DEAL WITH"
5,Black & Decker aaw100 8-inch wrench,A very handy tool to have around the garage for the person who has everything. Works great. Have had no problems with it.
1,Buy a real wrench,"The slop and wide tolerances on this device make it unusable. Yes, the jaw moves on it own but it does not close tightly enough to prevent rounding off. A better choice is Crescent or Stanley adjustables with the slanted jaw to match the profile of a six sided nut.Crescent Adjustable Wrench - Black Phosphate Finish 8 InchorStanley 87-369 8-Inch Adjustable Wrench"
2,Don't get if you are a regular tool user,This is good for a beginner but it doesn't grab on tight and has many limitations in where it can be used.
3,"OK wrench, sort of.....","B&D 8 inch auto wrench, goes in and out all right, but mediocre quality at best, not for heavy projects. Jaws do not open wide enough for a kitchen drain, which I believe was one of the applications they suggested it for."
1,not happy,"i was really upset with this product. i first time i tried to use it to remove a laundry hose,it wouldn't get tight enough to do anything."
2,Auto adjustable wrench,"This product is kind on cheesey. The movable part of the wrench is loose, (wobbles around) even once tightend on the nut, bolt, etc. It is also heavy, but it works o.k. for minor adjustmets and light duty work. It gets a lot of comments everywhere I take it out and use it."
2,Disappointed,I am somewhatdisappointed in this wrench because it just isn't what I expected. It is useful but tricky to use. I am still using my old adjustable wrenches and wil probably give the Auto Wrench toone of my sons if they want it.
2,Not worth the money for me,Still go back the normal wrench when needed. The Auto wrench is too bulky and just a gimick. Go with the old tried and tested.
3,Not easy to use,"I find that the product is difficult to use. Hard to remember/tell which button is for closing and which one for opening.The manual adjustment, however, is a nice addition over similar products."
3,Cool gadget - but not for serious plumbers,"Bought it for my son as a gift. So when I finally tried it out at his house I wasn't blown away. This is handy when you can only fit one hand in those hard to reach places, but it really is more of a gimmick gadget than a serious work tool. It's just ""aight""."
1,Junk,Really it's fun at first but it doesn't last long because of the cheap internal parts and like stated previously it really doesn't get that tight.Lot's of better tools to spend your money on.
2,Not very useful,"Awkward to use. Does not grip well. Seems to work about half the time, and that is not when I need it. It is too large to fit into tight jobs. Sort of embarrassing to pull out this large fancy tool that makes the job harder to do."
3,"Not bad, but there are better","Not a bad wrench but it tends to bind easily and the mechanism has a hard time defying gravity if it's turned on it's side.There are better types of adjustable wrenches out there, namely the sliding-adjust Kobalt series at Lowes."
4,Black & Decker adjustable wrench,"The wrench works well-just as advertised. Because of the battery compartment the handle is a bit bulky. It is still workable, and it works well in tight quarters where it is difficult to adjust a mechanical wrench."
3,bought as gift,I bought this as a gift for my Dad who has everything. He really wanted it and couldnt find it locally. Well he got it and wasnt that impressed. I dont know much about tools so.....
3,"A Good Idea, But Needs a Bit More Work","I purchased this wrench for its ""auto adjusting"" feature, hoping it would make loosening/tightening nuts/bolts etc easier. While the jaws of the wrench are easily adjustable, they often fail to tighten securely. It is a good idea that just needs a bit of tweaking."
1,its more a novely/toy than a tool,It does not grip tight on nuts and its annoying to get to the battery. I always find it dead (Most likely because the switch is not well protected that makes it activate when in a tool bag).Even once hand tightened it still plays which eats nuts and bolts. I thought it would be useful and make unscrewing faster but i never use it because it eats the metal anytime enough force is necessary.I got the Crescent AC8NKWMP 8-Inch Rapid Slide Adjustable Wrench and liked its performance instead.
3,Careful of dangerous packaging,"Just a word from my experience here - a little of my own blood spilt might serve as a warning. Be VERY CAREFUL opening the packaging on the auto wrench. The plastic is extremely difficult to cut and breaks with extraordinarily sharp edges (thus the bleeding...). The only way I can think of to safely open this packaging is to slice the back of the plastic with a brand new utility knife blade and using gloves, pull out the wrench from the back. If you have any bleeding disorders please do not do this yourself.The wrench itself is very convenient to use if you just have one hand available. If the company can get its act together on the packaging I would have rated it higher."
5,excellent wrench,I purchesed this product for my husband who uses it everyday and he was so excited about it. He does field maintenance for the postal service and this tool is the best invention.
4,Great product.,I bought two for Christmas gifts. The two people loved them. shipping and price were much cheaper through amazon than anywhere else online
4,Nice OVER PRICED wrench..,"This wrench works great.. If it had cost about $20.00 instead of $40.00 each, they would be great gifts."
4,NEAT WRENCH,IT WAS A THRILL FOR MY HUSBAND WHEN I GAVE IT TO HIM. HE WAS THE FIRST ONE AT WORK TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HE LIKES IT
3,It was ok,I ordered this awhile ago so I am not sure why you are asking about it. It was a present for my husband and he liked it ok.
3,AUTO WRENCH - LIGHT DUTY TOOL,"I DID NOT EXPECT THE HIGHEST QUALITY PRODUCT WHEN I PURCHUSED THREE OF THE AUTO WRENCHES AS STOCKING STUFFERS. I EXPECTED A TOOL FOR LIGHT DUTY USE. B&D DID NOT DISAPOINT. THE CONCEPT IS EXCELLENT BUT I WOULD BE AFRAID TO USE THE AUTO WRENCH ON ANY SERIOUSLY STUCK NUT. HOWEVER FOR DAILY ODD JOBS AROUND THE HOUSE IT IS AN EXCELLENT ADDITON TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM TOOL CABINET. IFYOU BUY IT FOR ODD JOBS AND TINKERING, IT IS A GREAT TOOL."
3,Perfect for the Junk Drawer,This is a handy innovative tool but a serious wrench it is not. The lower jaw is a bit sloppy which makes it difficult to apply heavy force. If it were a little less expensive I would rate it four stars but the wrench is a tad costly for what you get. The good news is that it is ideal for keeping in the kitchen junk drawer for quick light duty jobs around the house and it makes a good gift for dad or grandpa.
4,Black and Decker Auto Wrench,"Easy to use and works well. My only complaint is that I wish it had a greater opening range. There were several jobs where I needed the wrench to open just a bit wider. Otherwise, it's everything it claims to be!"
1,Cool idea but Very POOR quality,"Save your money and don't waste it by buying what can only be described as junk. The idea seemed great but the execution was very poor. I bought this wrench as a gift for my husband and the excitement quickly turned to frustration and disappointment. The wrench kept jamming, never adjusted and has never worked right--It ended up in the trash. There are obvious problems with quality and workmanship. Black and Decker's good brand reputation is diminished by the poor quality of this wrench."
5,Great for a theatre techie,I am a Drama teacher and I work with stage lights a lot. There are two completely different sizes of adjustment screws on each light. This tool makes it easy to hold the instrument in one hand and install of adjust it with the other. Love this wrench!!!
2,More of a toy than a tool,I think it's very overpriced and really not worth much. Might as well use a manual wrench for $5 vs paying $40.Pass.
5,Blak and Decker Auto Wrench,Black & Decker AAW100 8-Inch Auto Wrench Adjusting WrenchA great wrench and works well. Shipping was reasonably fast during the holiday season.
1,Horrible idea,There is no reason for anyone to have ever designed this product. It is just ridiculous to think that it would work better than original design.
2,My toolman hates it,"My husband is a construction professional and loves trying ""new"" tools and gadgets when they come out. Well, I bought this for him as a stocking stuffer type gift and he says it works horribly. If he uses it, very rarely, all he does is complain and then he gets, what he calls, ""a real wrench"".Not recommended for the the real toolman!"
3,Ok game,Sneaking around= cool. Human guards just asking to be knocked out= cool. Zombies and floating attacking fireballs= stupid. Thief as a game= mostly good. Its worth the measly 20 bucks. Buy it today.
5,Thief redefined first-person gaming.,"There's no doubt about it; Thief: The Dark Project singlehandedly redefined first-person gaming. Joe Kucan (better known as Kane of Command & Conquer's Nod faction) mentioned this as one of his favorites, and the game is referenced in many articles in Gamasutra, Gamespot, Gamespy, and other gaming web sites. Other first-person games such as No One Lives Forever (Monolith) and Wolfenstein 3D (id) have attempted to incorporate ""stealth tactics,"" but without the same success. Thief introduced gamers to the world of stealth, to the notion that high-powered weaponry was not sufficient for accomplishing a game's mission. This Gold edition takes the original and adds three missions - a worthy addition to any true gamer's library."
5,"Frustrating at times. In other words, challenging. great!","I once was a player of role playing games way back when Wolfenstein (great game) came out. As time progressed I was less and less impressed with the games that came out. A friend told me about a game called Thief and I decided to buy it on a whim. I was flabergasted. This is not an overstatement in the least. There are levels that simply amazed me and frustrated the hell out of me too. This is the game that many (most actually) gamers have been waiting for. It is not a game that sets its goals and plots on how many people you can kill in a level, but rather how few people are killed and how stealthy you can be. Amazing game. You will not disappointed!"
3,STARTED OUT PROMISING......,"....but tried to turn into just another first person shooter. except its hard to kill zombies with a broad head arrow, especially when they just get back up. thief started out a great game, with new styles of game play, and a sense that you arent a tank. the first few missions are very cool indeed, but then i just started to hate the game, and ultimately stop playing when i found that all i was going to do was shoot at giant spiders and zombies and other crap that was never mentioned on the box when i forked the 30 bucks over. someone tell eidos that sneaking up behind guards is hard eneough, and that in-human, god like foes is not necessary. thief 2 should be good, since im sure everyone else has had the same thoughts as me. my advice is to wait till thief 2, and buy this one when its on the 10 dollar shelf"
1,Not What I Ordered,"I was very disappointed when I received my order as I was specifically looking for the ""Fragrant"" cleanser. Most of my search efforts resulted in ""fragrance free"" which was very clearly stated. This product did not specify that it was ""fragrance free"" so I thought for sure I was getting what I wanted. The 4 bottles I received turned out to be ""fragrance free"" which was very disappointing."
1,If you want your face to be covered in whiteheads then this is the product for you...,"I think the title speaks for itself. Spending the extra money on a nicer product is worth it. This stuff is like dish soap. If you want to wash your face with dish soap, then you can buy a bottle of Joy at the dollar store...The pump is cool though, so I dumped all of it down the sink and put my new cleanser in the bottle."
4,Good product,I purchased the scoket specifically to remove my oil drain plug. It works well and was reasonably priced. I would buy it again
3,"good phone, but it died after 15 months","We bought the phone in Jan 2002. It had all the features we were looking for, held its charge, was intuitive to operate, etc. The two issues we found were that it interfered with our wireless computer network (I believe an issue with other 2.4ghz phones) and the gotcha was that the handset died 15 months after we bought it (right after the one-year warranty expired). Uniden told us to replace the battery, that didn't work, repair is more than the phone is worth. It was good while it worked."
5,Excellent,Can;t go wrong with this author - excellent read. I love GLH and she hasn't disappointed me yet - love it was an ebook also.
2,Handy little jump drive - but didn't last,"It's small and sturdy and works reliably. The cap is held on by a very tight rubber strap that fits in a groove running around the edge of the drive. This prevents accidentally losing the drive if you hang it on a key chain.December 2010 - Oops! It worked fine for a couple of years, but is no longer recognized by my computer. (My other thumb drives and SD cards still work fine.) I suppose I got my money out of it since it lasted about 2 1/2 years. But I think a product with no moving parts should last longer."
1,Great way to lose all your data!!,"I've had two Lexar jump drives which have both failed after less than 1 year of use. In both cases, I lost ALL data on each. Before they failed, I thought they were wonderful - in fact I carried my ENTIRE professional data and document base in one of them. They were wonderful until they failed. Lexar offers no method to salvage the data. They offered to send me replacements if I send the drives back - drives which still contain sensitive and irreplaceable data. What a bargain, I get a replacement after losing everything. If you insist on buying Lexar jump drives, back them up daily!! They can fail without warning."
5,very portable,the rubber protection works great. dropped it many times and it still works fine. my other viking usb drive bought the same time already had broken part.
2,pretty but runs small,I bought these slippers for my mother. They are beautiful. She asked for a size 9. The slippers were very small-her foot was at least an inch over the back and the entry for the foot is very small and tight. I wear a size 8 and couldn't even get my foot in. I am returning them-too bad a larger size is not available.
2,disappointed...,"Not the greatest pair of slippers. For the price i was expecting really good craftsmanship, but was disappointed, the shoe was also not deep enough, even though I ordered 1/2 size bigger than I usually wear. Had to send it back."
2,difficult for installation,"Al querer hacer su instalacion aparece insistentemente,muchoruido,pruebe otra vez. Tanto en microfono como en v auxiliarde plano, lo tengo de adorno sin poderlo instalar.(asesorenmepues tengo casi toda la informacion via internet e instructivosy nada...... ) por su apoyo gracias"
1,Gone was the scent,I purchased this cologne approximately six months ago. There is 3/4 left in the bottle and I noticed there is no more scent. When I used it it does not smell anymore. I felt like cheated on this one. I don't recommend buying this product.
1,Way too pungent,"I have thought about buying a ""Creed"" product for some time now. However, after purchasing Creed Vetiver I am leary of ever buying another Creed Cologne. It was way too strong and had a fragrance of a Christmas wreath that would not go away for hours. The ""grassy,ceder,pine"" fragrance was a bit overwhelming.JDH"
5,Wow!,"What a great CD! The songs are terrific! They have done a great job cleaning these up. I doubt if the originals sounded as well. Guthrie is in fine form as he talks, sings and plays through a slice of American history. He is a real musical genius! This is a steal at any price!"
5,GODFATHER OF FOLK,"I admit it. I'm a folkhound from the get go and I love this collection. The selection of songs not to mention the strong lyrics and emotions they evoke is truly a masterpiece. Woody Guthrie was a musical purist in the truest sense of the word. He had a real gift for stirring one's conscience. His songs were widely played at unions, peace marches and other gatherings for generations. He is the Balladeer of the People; the Voice for All.Please, please, listen to this collection. I really think you will be glad you did. This is truly high caliber work."
3,OK,"Like any stainless steel product that I have purchased, they all seem to scratch very easily. Just from wearing it one day, if I am at a computer and setting my wrists down on the desk, it will scratch it. Very disapointed in stainless steel in general."
3,Good book,The book has a good indication of the value of today's worth.Good for the beginner of Depression Glass investigating.
3,Why so expensive?,"Come on Amazon! Over $5 for these melts? That can't be right. Our local small-town store is selling them for half that price, and I've seen them priced even lower than that at other retailers.That being said, these melts are OK. For best results, use a chocolate melter or double-boiler. If you want a really smooth coating, buy Paramount Crystals; otherwise it's nearly impossible to get the smooth look you see in confectionery stores or photographs. For home use, these melts are OK. If you really want nice ones, go with a higher-end brand from a bakery supplier."
1,WILTON CANY MELTS,I was going to buy several bags on Amazon thinking they were much larger bags than the standard 14oz. Your list price is 9.99.. WHY i have never paid more than 2.99 anywhere. I always consider your sight for value. something seriously went wrong here.
1,"Why so expensive, Amazon??","The quality of these melts are great. However, why is Amazon selling them for 3x the price they sell for at Michaels?? Amazon please fix the pricing for all of the Wilton candy melts. It appears you will have a lot of sales if the pricing is corrected- I know I certainly would be a regular buyer from you."
3,Incorrectly labeled,The package I received contains and states dark cocoa but on the back there is a sticker stating light cocoa. I need the light cocoa for my project which is what I ordered not the dark cocoa melt.
3,Price a little high,"The price here is a little high, but I needed them and couldn't find them anywhere locally. They worked great as usual."
1,Don't waste your money!,Ordered this and had to return it after my Sony Shower Radio sprung a leak after several wonderful years of use. This cheap replacement had terrible static on AM and FM. Should have saved my time and money and ordered the Sony Shower Radio instead.
3,ok but could probably get better,"The radio seemed alright at first but the volume when turned up gets very distorted. The reception tends to fade also;but, when it's clear it is clear. It works better for a bath tub than shower, not as much noise to muffle sound."
2,not so great....,"I bought this radio because it's digital and I thought it would be easier to tune. The first radio I got worked about a week and I had to send it back. Amazon was very good about getting me a new one and so far so good but it doesn't get am radio stations in very good (my husband likes the sports shows). Overall, I wish I would have spent the extra $20 and got a good one. I guess ""you get what you pay for"" is the truth."
1,This radio sucks!,"I utterly regret making this purchase. First off the cardboard mirror fell off as I was peeling off the protective plastic from it. While I liked the preset feature, it undid itself after a day or so. Volume is extremely low-cannot hear beyond running water. Reception sucks! After a few days you could not get a clear station and the little clock display was illegible. Do not buy this product."
1,Poor sound,"This item was as decribed, but the radio sounded bad and the reception was terrible. I'm soory I made this purchase."
4,Makes you want more info.,I have read all of Zecharia Sitchins books. You kind of have to skim over a lot of the material. It gets drawn out but it sure makes sense out of a lot you read in the bible. I wish he had them on videos.
2,Are We Alone,"Me being an avid ufo buff and reading others comments, which convinced me to purchased the DVD I was disappointed with the film . It seems to be a little misleading in the effect that I thought there would be more time spent covering ancient text and ruins, instead of poor video production of the cosmos. The beginning of the film made it really hard to stay focused in hopes of waiting for something really good to be reviled. Out of an hour long DVD only 15minutes of interesting information really intrigued me and this is coming from a fan of Zecharia Sitchin. I wish he had a better since of presenting information when it comes to putting it in video form., i'm glad that i purchased it used."
3,OK But . . .,I wish Sitchin and the narrators had shown the old sources(Sumarian and Egyptian)supporting the belief that earth has been visited with technology during antiquity.
3,Dated....With Quality Issues,"Not a complete disappoint but the quality leaves something to be desired. It covers a lot of ground but depth of topic suffers from the short duration. The soundtrack has an annoying ""ticking"" noise throughout and the narration is indeed muffled. Lots of interesting facts to listen to and mull over. A lot of ground has been covered since this was made but it nevertheless serves as a good primer to Sitchin's work."
5,It's funny because it's true,"I have seen Doug Benson live, and have enjoyed the comedic stylings of Arj Barker for a few years. Unfortunately, I have heard less from the other author of this book, but his essays are some of the funniest. This book is thin, a quick, but enjoyable read. You will most definitely be nodding your head and saying ""That is so true!"" the whole time you are reading this. For a light, funny read, it's definitely worth checking out."
5,doug benson,All 3 comedians in this book are awsome and the book is a great read! If you missed the play then get the book and be prepared to laugh!
5,Wonderful and Inspiring!!!,"How wonderful this book is! I was very much touched by this wonderful story. I have read a lot of books, but this one really touched my hart, I could not contain my emotions and tears came out. The author captivated me from the beggining,I had to read it all, it makes you realize that you have to apreciate lefe and not take if for granted. It is a very loving relationship between a mother and a son, it helps you become strong in life.It is a book that you can read over and over again and I have recommended it to all my friends and family."
3,Every second foldout is black and white,"Tamayos painting in this book is very warm and pleasant, however half the pages, every second foldout, is black and white images, which reduces a lot from some of the paintings.I might also have liked a book with more text to accompany the images, but then again, that might have raised the price, and this time I was after something inexpensive.Good book to have in the bookshelf, but far from being the best book on Tamayo I can imagine."
4,Good product...,"Purchased this product to use at my barbershop. It is very comfortable and the customers loved it... but it attracts hair like a magnet. If you have pets... think before you buy this one. I had to give this away to a hair-free, pet-free home."
3,Good lumbar support,"This product does provide good lumbar support. I use it on my computer chair, but I'm sure it would be very good in the car, too. Good value for the money."
1,What Lumbar Support?,"The title is deceiving. I ordered this specifically for the advertised ""lumbar support"" in the item name and description. Unfortunately, this was a complete misrepresentation of the product, as it offers no more support than a standard automobile seat. Also, the cushions shift on the seat, so I need to readjust every time I get in the vehicle. What a waste of money."
3,Fun but frustrating,"Like all golf games both video and real, when you hit the ball wrong, nothing seems to go right. This game is as fun as the other reviewers say but just when you think you have it figured out..."
5,Such a fun game,I love it. It's something I can play with my husband and with my 5 year old son! It doesn't get much better than that!
2,Not that Good,"After playing this game its a disappointment.Its not as good as Swing Away Golf , that golfgame is much better than this.the graphic was kinda bad and not worth buying."
4,Excellent!!!,This is my first Hot Shots Golf title. The graphics are gorgeous. The expressions on the golf players and the caddys are sometimes hilarious. The same thing can be said about what the caddys say to your player. Must-have if you like golf games without Tiger Woods marring up the screen.
4,Great Game!!,"I bought my husband a PS2 for his birthday in October and we just started out with racing games and I searched for a game that we could both play. One of my friends recommended this game and it doesn't disappoint, we love playing two player and making the characters trash talk...it's great!!! I loved the graphics."
5,5 Star Game,"Hot Shots Golf 3 is a great game. It throws Tiger Woods out the window and tosses him out of the world ranking again too. When I first fot this game as a greatest hit, I couldn't figure out the controls, but I found a guide online and found out the controls are easy as can be. Tournament mode was fun, but I like unlocking new characters the most. Mitch, the Sasquatch is the best one. I like that you can tell which one of your friends is the best. I'm semi- pro. Since there aren't any good golf titles and you like golf like me, I highly reccomend it."
3,"if you like golf games, check this one out","I am not the biggest golf fan in the world, but had heard some good things about this series. There are no big golf pro endorsements, no real-life courses simulated, etc. Just a fun golf game that looks good and doesn't take itself all that seriously. One thing that is extrememly realistic are the ""physics"" involved in the game. Also, it is very easy to just pick up and start playing. The only thing I really didn't like is the caddy talking ...annoying."
1,THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST VIDEO GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST VIDEO GAME EVER! GRAPHICS ARE AWFUL, SWINGING THE CLUB IS SUPER HARD AND ONLY 2 COURSES AND 2 GOLFERS ARE UNLOCKED WHEN YOU FIRST BUY THE GAME! I LITERALLY SMASHED THIS GAME INTO A MILLION PEICES AFTER JUST 6 HOLES! I WOULD RATHER SPEND A YEAR IN JAIL THAN SPEND 30 MINUTES PLAYING THIS DUMB VIDEO GAME!"
4,"The Sacrament of Baptism is God's Work, Not Ours","Das does a service to the Christian Church and especially to those who understand the sacrament of Baptism as primarily the beliver's confession, act, or response.By building his case using the Old and New Testament Scripture, as well as Church history, Das demonstrates that God is the creator, initiator, and bestower of new life in Baptism, and that this new life that is bestowed is not limited to subjects who can verbalize their faith in Christ.God does not limit this washing of regeneration and forgiveness to adults or mature children. His mercy extends to all people, regardless of sex, social status, race, ethnicity, or age. Christians in the last four hundred or so years, not Christ, have placed limits on those suited for baptism. The New Testament and early church history attest to this fact: newborns all the way to the elderly are included in this holy work of God."
2,"Very nice, but they don't last long.","I had/have these in my Chrysler Town & Country and they really out perform the stock lamps. So far one of the lamps failed after only 6 months. The other one is still working, but I have a spare lamp in the glove box as a backup. Oh yes, the replacements and the spare are Wagner Long Life. We'll see how these fair."
4,100 on the money,Variety maybe limited but it's definitely still worth the price that you pay considering you get over twice as many as you would from a pharmacy store for the same price. Next time i run out i will definitely repurchase this item.
2,Not what I expected.,"There's not much variety in this 100 Condoms Variety Pack. When the seller states ""variety"" one would expected many different types, but that wasn't the case with this particular item. What I got was 4 different kinds of condoms. It was disappointing and not much to choose from. I am sure Durex makes more than 4 different kinds of condoms. Seller should definitely clarify what the buyer is actually getting."
4,Wish for a little more variety...,I wish there was more variety to this pack because some types had very few compared to others.
2,Condoms decreased my sexual stimulation,"I'm sorry. But I had no idea that sex was going to change so dramatically when I bought this product. I had to justify my purchase, so for one hundred lifestyle covered climaxes - I felt cheated in life.In addition, my wife has left me and these things feel awful without a partner."
3,Still too loud,I bought this muffler to replace a Magnaflow that was too annoying while pulling a large travel trailer.It is slightly less annoying but still sounds throaty. It is NOT stainless whereas the Magnaflow was.Very good weld quality. We'll see how long it lasts.Update 11/22/11: After running this muffler for over six months it has gotten louder and now it is as loud as the Magnflow I replaced. So I wasted my time and money. Plus this muffler is not stainless steel.
3,Works Well With Linux,"I live in Internet Siberia and bought this to hook up a network of 5 machines.I tried this on a Windows XP system using the provided software, then updated from Creative web site (there is an xp driver). The thing would connect and work good for about 3 minutes and then it would stop responding. It would not disconnect/reconnect automatically. Disconnecting manually (using the windows icon) and reconnecting would take an unreasonable amount of time. So it is nerve-racking. There was never a time it would work for more than 3 mintues.After a week of searching for answers (there are plenty of other people that have the same issue with this modem) I pulled it and stuck it on a Linux machine. The modem now works perfectly. I have to say that the Windows driver/software is half-baked junk but the device itself is a good buy."
3,yay!,"its vinyl, its jackson 5, whats not to love? the sleeve picture was a bit faded and worn but the record is just fine."
1,Falling Stars,"I thought it would be cool to construct the constellations on the ceiling of my newborn daughter's room in the exact location as the date and time she was born. I even wanted to include planets. It was awesome and beautiful when I finished. The twins were just over the East-North-East horizon, Orion was sightly higher in the East and BOOTE was on the Northwest horizon, just to name a few. Within two weeks of getting them up, they started coming down. Imagine my horror when I found small stickers in reach of my newborn that had fallen from the ceiling. Scherwinn Williams Promar 400, Eggshell Dover White is the paint I used on her room four months earlier. This is a standard type latex paint so it was NOT the problem.Cool idea but the stickers don't stick. Also, the glow only lasts a little over five minutes - a little longer if it is pitch black in the room.I would give this 10 stars if only the stickers stuck."
3,Good Series ruined by stupid producers,"This series was enjoyable and interesting for a while. The life of an extended latino family in modern Los Angeles seemed to have a lot of potential. It totally lost me however, when they made the episode showing the family in black and white film having adventures in the days of Pancho Villa. One of the producers had some old photographs of the period and thought it would be a fun thing to do. This sort of uncalled for self indulgence ruined the whole concept. Why take the time and effort to build characters that people understood and enjoyed and then all of a sudden demonstrate that they are not real characters at all, merely puppets on a string that the producers can do anything with that they like. Anyway, that was the last episode that I watched, even though I bought the DVD set. It was that irritating."
1,"If you want your employer to take you seriously, skip this book.","This book has a major case of TMI, goes off on political tangents, and comes off as being very unprofessional. I mean, really! Made-up stories ""illustrating"" fictional trans-people's experiences with coming out in the workplace? Can't she find some real-world (read: relevant) examples? And some of the tangential discussion of MtFs suffering abuse as children for not being masculine enough, or of them spinning off second personalities as a result of their GID would, frankly, just scare off a lot of employers. Don't waste your time and money on this book.It might be a good book for someone who is just looking into transition, and wants more info for themselves, but it is entirely inappropriate for the workplace. Instead, I recommend looking at ""Transgender Workplace Diversity"" by Jillian Weiss."
4,A good addition to a transition package....,"I am a MTF trannsexual employee and I am in the process of transitioning at work. I put together a package of information for the HR dept and my boss. All involved have taken the time to read the material, including this book and the coworker's guide. All have said that the approach I've used will help things go smoothly.They also stated that they were really pleased I had included the books with the package. I believe that it helped ease past the restroom issue, which was taken care of in one day."
5,This book teaches us a positive aspect of TS.,Today TS employees have much difiiculties in transition on the job in Japan.This book teaches us a positive aspect of TS as a employee.And this book also shows the employer how to solve the problem very practically.I hope many Japanese employer will read this bookand more TS employees can do transition on the job in our country.
5,Scripturally Sound,Please don't mind the folks who are boycotting the Pearls and writing negative things everywhere they can! This book is an excellent read about man's position in Christ and how he was designed to know the Creator.
5,Excellent book,"Everyone reading this book and others written by the Pearls will recognize that they are based on the Word of God and for this reason they have many enemies. When people heard the truth from the Lord Jesus in person they said ""who can suffer this talk"" or ""he is evil"". If people could say that about the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, what should we expect about his followers? If the World hated Jesus' ministry, they will hate the ministry of any of His followers who want to be approved by God alone and speak the truth. People don't like to hear God's opinion. It tortures their conscience. The Bible says that in the last days people will not want to hear the truth but teachers who will tell them what they want to hear.If you want to know the truth, read the Bible yourself and see if the Pearls ministry is from man or from the Lord. Maybe your pastor taught you only some truth or a twisted truth. The Lord said : ""read for yourself""."
1,A sick individual,"This man is one truly sick individual, advocating in his other texts for child abuse. How a person can read anything by a person like that and take their twisted advice to heart is a mystery to me. Spare yourself and read something written by a true christian that actually lives a just and good life, not someone who twists God's words into his own demented agenda."
1,Don't Go near it,"I purchased these bulbs and replaced them as pair when one of my OEM bulbs needed replacement. Within a month of replacement, my first Silverstar went off and in a week or two the second one followed suit. For the money that i paid, this bulb is a piece of work. I will never go with these bulbs again."
4,It's a good read,Mary Willis Walker is one of my favorite author. I would have given this book a higher mark but I read Under the Bettle's Cellar (a must read)which is by far Ms. Walker's best work so far.
2,Walker trivializes serial murder.,"Red Scream turned out to be not only a disappointment, but a trivialization of its major concern, serial murder.The protagonist, Molly Cates, is not especially likeable from the beginning. She is best characterized as whining and self-absorbed. And she doesn't grow on you with the passage of time.Molly's pursuit of ""justice"" smacks of self-serving justification, rather than a real desire to preserve justice. Her stance on capital punishment, too, seems more like posturing than a genuine moral objection.Couple Molly's character flaws with a plot that seems all to predictable and you have identified the source of this reader's irritation with the book."
2,How did this win the Edgar last year ? Slow and dull ...,"Much too formulaic for my taste. Having a beleaguereddivorced reporter coping with fundamental culturaldifferences in other characters and slowly coming to therealization that she is in the real world and things arenot always as they seem ... been there, done that.Walker's book does not come close to the consistentlyexcellent efforts of J.L. Burke, M. Connelly, J. Sandford,J.W. Hall, etc. who also work socio-psychological themesinto their mysteries but with much more compelling plotand climax."
3,Lacklustre,"I have to say I am surprized by the glowing reviews that this book has previously received on Amazon - disapointed too as I bought the book on the strength of them. That will teach me!The Red Scream is not a bad book it is simply nothing special. Yet another pseudo-femminist heroine of a certain age, with a boring relative (daughter) for padding.Each chapter is introduced by a deliberately bad poem (by the ""arch-villain"") which is of no relevance to what immediately follows (that I can see) and has, therefore, no validity stylistically or otherwise. And the constant harping on about ""the red scream"" itself? I got it the first time. It didn't need hammering home!The cover design is cheap and nasty and the cover blurb is ludicrous - ""One of the creepiest killers since Hannibal Lecter""??? I think not!It reads like a crime story by numbers. The kind of safe, formulaic fiction that publishers churn out when they want a safe bet .Disappointing."
4,A good read,This is the first book I've read by this author. I liked it enough that I will definitely read more of her work. The heroine was very likable. Her writing style was above average. The plot was interesting. Her character Bronk was intriguing.
3,Not as good as it could be,"The historical content and narrative of this video were informative. It gave a good overview of the variety to be found in Austria. However, the quality of the photography was poor. Some pictures were unclear, and the colors looked washed out. For the price I paid, I was disappointed in this video."
5,DAVID THE COMPLAINER NEEDS TO CLEAN! or GET NEW GLASS'S!,"""""""(60) Sixty Minutes of OUTSTANDING PHOTOGRAPHY & SOUND! THIS ISA MUST HAVE - BEST BUY ON AUSTRIA!"""""""
1,"At best, Filler",Nothing much happens in this story. It's a ripoff of Voyage of the Dawn Treader with a bit of Gulliver's Travels added in an attempt to provide some flavor. The whole book feels like it was written as an afterthought. You could easily skip it and miss nothing in the story.
5,Mel Gibson shows his true form!,"This early film in Mel's career shows his great ability to act in a non-action role. His character is a little slow and his family shelters him from some harsh realities. He gives this role 110% and it shows! I would have liked to have seen more depth in the story itself but the DVD wrought some tears out of me. Piper Laurie...I'm not a big fan but she does her role very good. Mel is the true winner here and if you are a fan you have to see this to really appreciate his acting ability. Plus, he is so absolutely sexy in some tight shorts and a speedo! What ""wouldn't"" I do to be one of his leading ladies....xxxooo"
5,A Gentle Love,"Years ago I'd read the book Tim by Colleen McCullough that this movie is based on and really enjoyed it. I'd forgotten all about that until finding this in a video store. What a great surprise!Tim is considered a sweet but incapable man by most people in his life. His parents protect him, his co-workers take advantage by leaving him the grunt work to do, and his sister wonders why anyone would want spend extra time with him. Ms. Horton, an older, educated woman and employer, is the only one that recognizes his potential and realizes he's worth treating as an equal. She walks a fine line of protecting and respecting him and ultimately gives him the greatest gift of all, her heart. He does the same and it's wonderful story to see unfold. I've never quite seen anything like this before in either book or movie. It's such a gentle romance that it slowly leaks into your body and leaves you wanting more. Recommended."
4,A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE STORY...,"This is a gem of a film, starring the underrated Piper Laurie in the role of Mary Horton, a well-to-do, but lonely, business woman, who befriends Tim Melville, a very nice, good looking day laborer, earnestly played by a very young Mel Gibson. Tim happens to be a little simple. His family describes him as being ""a few short of a full quid"".While he does work around her house, Mary gets to know Tim, as well as his working class family. As time goes on, a deep fondness that ripens into love develops between the two. He brings her out of her shell, and she teaches him to read and explains concepts that will enable him to function better in the world around him. Based upon Colleen McCollough's book of the same name, this is a very well acted-film, with fine performances by the supporting cast, as well as the leads."
2,"""Tim"" ?","""Tim""is a movie about a young, handsome mentally challanged young man who falls in love with an older woman as a result of a chance metting. It is supposed to be sweet and touching and fails miserably to be either. I had to ask myself what audience the wardrobe department was trying to target, women or The Village People? Even the sound track is insipid. Mel Gibson was obviously being tauted as eye candy for some target audience."
4,Very nice,"My grand daughter loves this book.It has all kinds of ideas for having a party...Worth buying, would recommend it. Makes a great gift.."
4,Let's Have A Tea Party,"Nice little book for ideas, projects and recipes for hosting a tea party for children or friends. Used it for my granddaughters princess party for some ideas. Was a cute book. Not may books available on hosting tea parties."
4,Good book.,This book has good ideas about different kinds of tea parties. But not many of them fit my daughters likes. We enjoyed it though.
5,How to Have a Perfect Tea Party!!,"This book was the perfect tool my ten year old granddaughter living in Botswana needed to make her birthday party a success! She was excited to read it from cover to cover as soon as it was unpacked! She followed the instructions and happily planned her own 10th birthday! What a keepsake and treasure this book will be to her through the years! This is a MUST HAVE for all little girls who like to ""pretend and dress up""!"
1,"Slow, tedious, confusing game","I can't begin to describe how slow each level loads, how easily you get killed, and then you have to wait out that load period again to get back in the game. And when I stopped for the day, I couldn't find where I had left off when I came back, since the levels are circular, with levels within the levels, and the game doesn't remember for you, at least not that I was ever able to tell. It was just awful. Even with a Gameshark, it was excruciating. I never finished it."
3,flawed but good,"All right, this is a good game for some time, but if you die, you have to wait a long time for the same level to load again. Oh yeah... WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE MOVIE??? Yeah, its fun until you get through the first levels, but you may find yourself staring at the waal, wondering why you bothered. Buy it if you are a die-hard fan though."
4,I love peter pan,My son had this game when he was young and I loved it so much. I am so glad to have it again. I feel like a kid again!
5,My Boys Love PETERPAN!!!!,"My little ones love neverland, and this is such a great little game for their imaginations...you can play as peter or tinkerbell....little girls, I'm sure would love to pretend to be tink!!"
2,Super cheesy boobie flick!,"Not worth the effort, super cheezy beach flick. Richard Branders attempt at semi porn, especially the inclusion of his wife with no talent. This movie stunk!"

1,This is full of chemicals - deceptive description,"Here is the list of ingredients for your reference:Water, Palmitic acid & stearic acid, octyl methoxycinnamate, glycerin, butyl methoxydbenzoylmethane, isopropyl myristate, potassium hydroxide, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, titanium dioxide & aluminium hydroxide & staric acid, zinc oxide, allantoin, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, disodium edta, polypropylparaben, BHT, Perfume ci 17200, LAC,wheat germ oil +12 herbal extracts and milk.As you can see this product is not paraben free!! While fair and lovely marketing this as ayurvedic just because they added 12 herbs do not make this product chemical free, preservative free or ayurvedic.I would not buy this again."
2,After so much research-Still Disappointed,"I did weeks of reading ingredients, researching brands, and trying to find both a safe and effective solution for the brown patches that have surfaced on my face over the last year or so. I thought this ""Fair and Lovely"" fairness cream would be the long term answer. I was wrong.First of all, the product I was sent was different that what was shown on the site. I knew there were two formulas and specifically wanted to first (older) one, not the updated (newer) one. The newer formula is reported to be far less effective. From there the smell was so strong I could not take using it daily...so now it just sit on my vanity unused. I am very disappointed and just too frustrated to ask for a refund.I am a 44 year old, africian american woman and have just decided to learn to live with my skin changes. The only reason I gave it two instead on one stars is because in all fairness I did not really use the product long enough because of the smell."
4,I like it...,Bought one tube of the cream and really liked it because I think it helped my complexion. I don't really notice a lightening of my skin at all...but I will continue to use it to keep my skin clear.
1,Received a different product!!,They sent a wrong product that is very different from what is shown here. Amazon should ban them immediately. The item is too expensive.
4,Pleased,"So far so good! I have combination skin and I applied this over night and it didnt make me greasy. I use it during the day with a sunscreen to be safe. Im sticking with it. Smells great, blends in easily...I like it so far."
2,"OK, as far as it goes","While the writing is easy to follow, I found this book to be rather annoying. I realize she is writing for people who may not have any knowledge of the chakra system. However, I found that her writing style was verbose, of the school ""why say in a paragraph what you can say in six?"" Despite that, I felt the book was lacking information. If you want to know more you are encouraged to buy yet another of her books, the workbook. And so, you are left rather hanging. I've encountered other such books where you need to buy additional books, and it is a real turn off, and this is the primary reason for only two stars. Go borrow it from the library. A better book for an east-west discussion of chakras and psychology is Carolyn Myss's Anatomy of Spirit."
3,"Over rated, not much better than Diablo 1","There are obvious improvements with Diablo 2 such as improved character developement and better graphics. But there really isn't a whole lot better about this game than its predicessor. Also, the fact that the game has been delayed and delayed some more has really got me wondering if they are ever going to get this right. Who knows, maybe the final version might change my mind, but this latest beta doesn't make me want to go stand in line and buy it whenever it does come out."
1,Some old thing...,I wrote this becuase the previous post's have hyped up this game way too much. It is not all that great. It's just diablo with a slight face lift and a ton of more items. If you loved diablo then you will consider this a nice update. If you where hoping for a more compelling theme or a different type of direction in which the game flows then you may not be too happy.
1,It's not that good......,"It's not that good cause well.... the graphics ar just as bad if not worse than the origanal and the gameplay is dffinitly worse and so is the sound so I would stick with ""Diablo"" classic"
2,Boring click fest,"First of all, this game is NOT an RPG. It's just a simple point and click adventure game. The only RPG thing about this game is you can level up your character and chose from 5 stats to level up. If you want a real RPG, buy fallout. The Fallout series has over 10 stats to chose from, is much more fun, and it is a REAL RPG. This game isn't much fun online, either. And the same quests over and over and over in the single player game doesn't do much for the game, either. The monsters are all the same with just new colours. Plus the save system stinks, you have to exit the whole game to save, whoever made that funtion needs to be beat. Blizzard is going down the tube. Buy Fallout, it's 50 times better."
4,DON&#65533;T buy this game!,"Unless you have loads of free time! This game is about 3 times as long as the original and at least twice as challenging and addictive. It will take at least several weeks to finish the game (depending on how much free time you actually have) and that's only with one character. Luckily, the very length of the quests involved may dissuade you from playing too often but only after many, many hours of play."
2,"The ""Save"" issue","I love the game: graphics, play,sounds.I cannot however, play online, as am not connected (long story)One MAJOR drawback I find in this game and that made me stop playing altogether (after completing the game and half of the expanded version): You CANNOT save the game and start at the same point where you stopped playing. If you do stop playing and choose (it's the only option) the ""save and exit"" button, it takes you back to town and you have to battle ALL the enemies all over again!! It is soo STUPID! I have never experienced that in any other game. I dont know, what they were thinking!Unless you either have NO life and all you do is play for weeks until you finish the game, or leave the computer on until you finish the game (I have a laptop and that is NOT an option), you are in trouble."
4,Almost Perfect,"Diablo 2 is almost everything I had hoped for in a sequel, If it wasn't for the dissapointing graphics and the game lags at the WORST possible time, I would have given it a 5, even including these flaws its still an EASY 4. The new character classes are excellent and as diverse as you could get while still playing the same game. The number of different weapons etc boggle the mind with the addition of Gems, Set Items and Rare items to add to the Magical and Unique items found in the original game. If you liked the original, you owe it to yourself to buy the sequel."
2,Stick to the original,"Wow! This was a huge upset. When i opened the package 2 days ago and rushed to install the game i was so excited. Then after i chose my character, typed in my name, and started playin i already noticed flaws. Bad graphics, bad sound, same old stuff. Inventory the same, story is basically the same. After an hour of playin it i was back playin halflife playin with my friends. The box, manual and game had ""mysteriously"" dissapeard only to be found in the garbage the next day. The only reason i gave this a 2 is cause, wait why did i give it a 2?"
5,Diablo 2 Rules,"The only thing better than Diablo 2 is the Diablo 2 Expansion Pack, Lord of Destrucion. Well worth it."
4,Great Game!,"Just when I had finally given up hope that Blizzard would ever release Diablo II, it arrived! I am not a big video game player, but I loved Diablo and Diablo II is even better. The plot is more apparent, making the game more RPG-like than a shoot-em-up. You have a lot more character control/ability to specialize your character than in many other games of this genre. Multi-player is more thought-out and established than in the first game, which is great. All in all, it's an intriguing and fascinating game! Addictive too :)"
5,Deluxe edition review,"Graphics are incredible and the monster and scenery variety is greatly improved. I am deep into Act III and am dreading the end of the game, but at least it is taking me longer than the day and half it took to finish Diablo I."
5,Diablo 2 - A more involved Gauntlet,"Diablo 2 is really a more pumped up Gauntlet. (Do you remember the game with the famous sayings, ""Warrior needs food badly""?) That said, I can't remember playing a game that is so consistantly enjoyable. A personal prefrence that I make in my gaming choices is that I don't like to spend hours figuring out puzzles and mazes. A little brain work is ok, but get me to the action, the monsters, the different weapons and levels quicker. Diablo 2 succeeds overwelmingly here. Non-stop action, yet still quest based. The game guides you through effortlessly, but never just gives everything away. A must-buy for casual and avid gamers alike."
4,Not As Good As The First,"I waited a long time for Diablo II (maybe too long). Yes, it's bigger with more monsters, better graphics, etc. But, it doesn't have the same spookyness that made Diablo I so appealing. The atmosphere of Diablo made it better. Diablo II is awesome for it's ""hack & slash"", but I miss the ""spooky"" sounds and atmosphere that just aren't there in Diablo II."
3,Not a lot of extras,The game is fun to play and it continues on with the Diablo game play. But it really doesnt deserve to be a version 2 but an expansion pack. Yes the dungeons do change a plus but I have tried all five characters and each got the same quests in the same order
4,"Nice game, but a bit repetitive","While this game is another well done rev of the original Faery Tale Adventure (Amiga) it does get a bit repetitive after a while. Whacking stuff with a sword and then picking up pieces doesn't require a whole lot of strategy. I much preferred Warcraft I and II to the Diablo series. Still, it's a well done game, nice graphics, decent interface and fun."
5,Great,"This game is a lot better than the original...YOU NEED TO GET THIS GAME!! The 5 characters makes it cool, the cinematics is great, and the only con I have against it is that I can't get to sleep at all, because it is so ADDICTIVE! I promise you, you won't be disappointed when you buy it. You'll be AMAZED."
3,Good for a while,"I bought this game thinking it would be outstanding. Boy was I sorry. Dioblo 2 is way to much like the first one. And the most bothersome problem for me is that it got boring really quick and there are virtually no replay values. Actally no replay values, I conquered the game and now it is sitting on the shelf collecting dust. If you want to spend money go somewere else."
4,Fun with Diablo,"I find the graphics and movement in most computer games jerky, and boring. I love the graphics and smooth motion, and conversations of these characters, although this type of game is not my cup of tea."
3,"Good, but can get a bit tedious","Diablo 2 is varied in it's aspects, from big barbarians to a guy that makes zombies. It's good that the classes are so varied. This game is truly good calming you down when you are angry. You simply take out your anger on the thousands of monsters in the game. The random area creation keeps you coming back. The downside to this is that it's repittive. It DOES get boring laying waste to hundreds of minions. The multiplayer mode is quite good though because of all the other players to interact with. There are A LOT of different kinds weaponry. This somewhat takes the fun out of getting the ""ultimate weapon"" though, because ther are a lot of ""ultimate weapons."" All in all, this game is good enough, but could stand a lot of variety."
5,CAUTION: EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE!! MOST FUN YOU'LL EVER HAVE.,"This game is incredible. You will become very addicted to this game once you play it and get the hang of it. It's extremely competitive on Battle.net. Battle.net, of course to me, is the whole main thing about this game. You will get extremely BORED to death if you play Single PLayer. If you play on Battle.net, you can build up your character and compete with other people around. The items are very fun to find because you always want to show off what you have to people and your friends. All in all, get this game if you like RPG style. Even if you don't like RPG, just give it a try and it'll pull you in immediately!!"
5,Diablo II is the Best!,"Ever since I got this game I have been addicted to it. You get to become the character and every time you go up a level you get to choose a special skill for you character. It is so addicting, but you you don't have time to waste this game is not for you. If you have loads of time then order this game right now!"
5,Best PC Game Ever,"This is definitely the most addictive game ever released on the PC.First when i bought the game,i wasnt into this kind of RPG but the game sucked me in with its addictive and challenging gameplay.The internet features are excellent too.But be warned this game might be too addictive for some and may result in loss of sleep and concentration.Believe me i am not joking.This game took many hours out of my sleep and took some of my grades down.But its worth it because this is one of the most enjoyable,addictive,challenging and rewarding game ever.Half Life is not the best game on the PC it is this...No further words necessary..."
2,Not half as good as the original,"For the extreamly lenghtly wait, I cannot beleive how bad this game turned out... the graphics are ok. the skills and spells are good, the cinematics are amazing, But this game is one level then 3 repetitive levels of the first one. you loose interest in it because its like doing the same thing througho0ut the game... daiblo one was my fave rpg, and still is. For such a long wait I was highly disapointed"
3,second versions are not as good as the original,"I bought this game hoping it would be much better than the version one (D1), The graphics are great, but it gest quite dull once you get past the second and third levels. The main problem is that the game cannot be saved unless you exit the game, and once you come back again, after saving you are no longer in the same place you left it. You need to run and basically fight again against all the monsters (if you can call them that) in order to go back to where you were (waste of time and energy).Even Hellfire was a much better versions (expansion) of D1, maybe the graphics of D1 and Hellfire weren't the best, but they sure was much more intresting plot than the one in D2I would recommend BLIZZARD to try a PS2 game of NINTENDO DS (portable) version of D2 with the graphics,could work and could be very fun."
4,Great game,"This game kicks ass. The only thing I don't like about this game is that they are so dang strict on maphacks.............arrgh.anyway, great game, one of Blizzard's best. Heck, all their games rock."
3,Disgusted,"Read all the other reviews, then this one.This Diablo has an incompetent save feature that precludes you from saving back to your most advantageous moment. Instead, it saves you back to the status you have after a loss. Wonderful!!Secondly, when you leave, you might start back with a loss of materials painfully accumulated after hours of play.Thirdly, after increasing your skill level you'll find that the monsters have increased their strengths, etc.Why bother? Save your money for some other way to waste your time.Thank you for your time."
3,Click click click...,"Literally too, expect your clicking finger to be tired after playing this game. It's just hours clicking on the screen endlessly to hack and slash the enemies. I don't even know why this game is called an RPG...it's more action than RPG...The good thing about it is the CG cutscenes. Flawless, the best cutscenes in any game. Period. Other than that, not worth the money."
4,I loved the game but Battle.net and bugs have ended that Luv,"I've been playing Diablo 2 since it came out. If you want to play against other people, via Battle.net, expect to deal with lag issues, down servers, and various other problems. Should you be able to deal with this and decide to try hardcore mode (you die, your dead) be warned! Yesterday I lost a level 50 necromancer that I put hours upon hours upon hours into and this character died while I was OFFLINE! Blizzard will not help or restore my character, so I can no longer enjoy playing or recommend this game to anyone. I'm now looking for alternative games to play."
4,Great whenever your bored,I play this game whenever im bored or have nothing else to do. Its a great game to play and all but those people who waste their whole lives on this game are nuts. Getting bad grades and endless sleep is just absolutly stupid and brainless. This game is great if u want to lose your brain and have no life but upgrading your character and getting the best weapons. I believe i have the best weapon so hahahahah mah s/n iz ]-[K^viru$ if ya ever intrested in playin Peace out yall!!
1,Not Good Enough!,"Sorry, Diablo 2 just doesn' cut it! After playing Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment and Icewind Dale, Diablo2 just seems obsolete for it's time. Icewind Dale comes out as the superior due not only to its accumulation of the wonderfully complex character attributes and characteristics, but also the continuing improvements in the whole game!"
2,Its Not all that great,The games really more of an ok to play for awhile kinda game.Too many ppl are making it turn out to be like this badA$$ game.The characters have fantastic powers...the best ive ever seen so far but the whole gameplay...it just gets boring after you play for awhile.ya know?
2,shift key broken,all what i have been doing in this game so far is pressing the shift key. i am almost done with act three and my left shift key is not working any more. the only thing motivating me to continue is the cinematics between each act. they r AMAZING... and the music is nice also. that's why i am giving two starts and not one.
1,DIABLO 2 SUCKS,"This is the most terrible RPG game I ever played BAH I rather play FF8 than this crap. First of all there is too much opened area not enough buildings to go into , second of all 5 pieces of gold every damn time and there is barely any third of all battlenet sucks it's always down Jesus christ if I could give a whole review for this game it would say CRAP CRAP CRAP THIS GAME SUCKS don't buy it if you don't like being bored and mad if you do this is a game for you...."
4,Susan should buy this,"this game is awsome for your children. Susan Gresser should buy this for hers. hint hint. great graphics. awsome game-play. great game for kids. not very gory, just bloody and has swears."
2,DOS days are here again,"The game has many flaws in it making it almost unplayable. The most notable is the Anti-copy feature on the CD's themselves making it impossible for some CD and DVD drives to read. At present Blizzard has no plans to fix this feature. Also the graphics and lag time in both online and single play are bad. In order to get the game to play you will need to tinker with the drivers and system options to get it to work. Reminds me of the old days of DOS where a Boot Disk had to be created to change your memory options. The box reports a minimum of 32Meg of memory, I would think it is closer to 64Meg. If your character incounters a large amount of monsters it will bog way down and the monsters will kill you before you get a hit in. If you must absolutely have the game I would wait a month for the problems to be fixed. There are already 2 patches in less then 2 weeks with number 3 in the works."
2,Strangely addictive,"This game is BAD. BAD. BAD. You walk through endless areas mindlessly killing randomly generated enemies. It has no plot. It has no plot.That said, I am addicted to it. It is strangely fun to see your character grow more powerful and...kill tons of randomly generated enemies.DONT GET THIS GAME! save yourself hours of wasted time. Of course, if mindless hack and slash adventures are your thing, you would enjoy it. Otherwise, get Baldurs Gate 2. (which just happens to be the best RPG ever made)"
2,"Chop, Chop, Chop, Click, Click, Click","If you like chopping weeds with a machete, this is your game. If you like a game that requires thinking, skip it."
3,not as good as I had hopped!,"If you like the battlenet play and the multi player mode you will like the game. I like the single player mode in Diablo and Hellfire and this new game does not save and let you continue to play. Trying new wepons is a nightmare! you get killed you lose all your cool stuff! Hackers need to make a thing to save character and restore it, like they did for Diablo. It is a good game but not if you like collecting the cool armor and trying new stuff. Also the spells are messed up, you are only allowed to use specific ones for each character (this is really stinks! )"
4,"Great, but repetitive","Most people remember the old game Diablo. Unfortunetly for me, i didn't. I thought as I started playing that I would stink, at it, and I was right. But after a while I got better, and played this game for hours. Then, the inevitable happened. I got bored!The game was really good, considring the fact that the graphics are very sketchy and need more pixels, butthe gameplay more than makes up for it. The sound and controls are very good, if not great. Overall, this is a great game with goo sound and control, but very repetitive. So I recomend this game to anyone who is not easily bored."
5,great game! addictive!,"if you liked Diablo you'll love Diablo II. Lots to do, I'm still not tired of it after months of play."
5,One of the greatest action games.,D2 is a really funny game and it get's funnier on battlenet.The graphics is GOOD.The characters are cool(i like the Necromancer).If you got broadband then i really recommend buy this game but even if you don't it is still good in single player.
4,In search for something more,"Well! I have been playing diablo for about one year now. It did not take me long to figure out the strategy and all the character classes. I have played all characters in three realms which makes the total number of characters that I have played, (24).The game is great and very fun and very addictive. However, you start to learn every corner, every corridor, every turn and it starts to become boring. Plus, you start to wonder, is this all there is to the game. I have been playing every day of the week for 8 hours or more each day with the hope of finding elite items and rare items that the game can spawn. I have become very discouraged with the output of the treasures that are promised.There is a lot of down time and lagging while playing the game.I have really given up hope of building my characters past the level of 85, 99 being the highest level there is.Its a great game but battle net has to find away to make the game more interesting. It has become mundain."
3,Great game in the beginning which quickly gets boring,"Diablo 2 is a great game when you first start out, but then after you clear the game the first time, things go downhill really fast from there on. The action gets monotnous and boring. Although I like the character advancement system, gameplay and graphics, playing it once through normal mode was enough for me.Multiplayer didn't work too well for me either since I had to play on the Asia server. Oh yeah, I have a character there, but with 0 playing time and level 1 thanks to lack of server space, it really wasn't much fun."
4,rise up diablo,"not quite as good as the hype but still very good. two things that bothered me. one, you cant port your single player character into battle net. and two the game gets boring since all the maps are huge and you could be searching for hours for an exit only to be killed while right infront of it because there are unique monsters guarding it. some monster have really cheap moves too, like fireballs that track you. its great to play on line but as single player game its kinda weak."
2,Blizzard gives birth to another bad egg,"The only diabolical thing about this game is how bad it is. Blizzard's strategy is this: make the game so much fun in the beginning that you sell lots o copies and than later it is no more fun. They make more money faster that way. But wasting money for this game which you will shelf after realizing there's nothing more to do is a bad idea. Hack, slash, pick up, hack slash, level up, pick up, hack, slash, player killer, hack, slash, kill, level up. That's how i can describe the game. Do yourself a favor, if you're a hack and slasher buy a hack and slasher that is actual FUN and doesn't try to be something it's not. RPG fans should really turn away from this...."
5,Diablo II Rocks,"Diablo 2 is a great game with a lot of new improvements of the original. The graphics are great along with the gameplay and the all new skills tech-tree. The only problem i found with is is that Blizzard got rid of the load time for new areas so the game lags a bit when you go somewhere new. The 5 character classes are great, the Necromancer being my favorite. Thats it, its a great game and you should get it as soon as possible"
3,Typical sequel,"While I think Diablo 2 is a great game and I enjoy playing it a great deal, there are negatives enough to make this a title better purchased on sale. On the up side, the plot is phenomenal, the characters are very exciting and interesting, and the world is more fun to be in. On the down, though, is the utter lack of replay ability, even given the new character classes. Unlike its originator, Diablo 2 featues only 6 quests per Act, all of which are set in stone - the order of presentation doesn;t even change game to game. There are numerous glitches in the game even after 2 patches, and there is no strategic thought into how to complete any given activity - the quest log leads you by the nose through everything. Overall the game is fun and I am pleased that it was money well spent for the entertainment, but after 3 years, I think Blizzard could have presented a much better game."
1,Well Not working...,"I had played this game in the past on a older computer and well with my newer one with vista and all, the game didn't like the game whatsoever, which was a bummer but didn't make a fuss about it since it was only a 10 dollar purchase, give the guy some money getting it off his hands and well haven't decided on what to do with it next. It was that common error where the computer said that the game disc was not in and I tried every thing I knew to do, downloading it even, which I never do any more, but even with the no cd hack and such still didn't work so just gave up on it but hey can say I have the game right? haha Well a short moment of glory. God Bless"
3,Not a fan,"I bought this as a present for my son, and after having to install a patch to fix the compatibility problems with Vista, my son played it for an hour then brought it back to me asking if it can be returned. I will check into the expansion pack to see if that will enrich the playing experience but as of now I'm disappointed,"
5,Diablo 2,Excellent game! Much better than the first game. It's even more entertaining with the expansion!!
3,"Good, bad and ugly","Graphics are acceptable, sound is nice, gameplay is addictive. However, the game falls short of creating the tension and atmosphere of Dialbo(1).Overall - good for playing once (at least for those amoing us who are not ""hardcore"" on-line players)."
2,Great the first time... Dont play online...,"It was good the first time through,but after that, it was all about ""MFing"" (magic item hunting)and endless boss/cow runs to improve your pointless charactor.i have tryed all the classes (around lvl 80 for each+variations)and it just drones on, and on.. and ON!dont buy it if you want to maintain sanity, and tanned skin.buy it if you like doing things over and over again.(BTW, it isnt anything like diablo1-- that game required skill, not patiance)"
2,Gets Borning,"The reason i gave this game 2 stars was the fact that u can only beat act 4 so many times. Sure, at first this was instantly my favorite game. But after about a month, there was nothing left to do. I had the best items in the game, i tore diablo a new one, and beat the thing on every level. I would recommend just borrowing this one from a friend, because it isnt worth playing for very long...."
2,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs","I have spent $400 upgrading my computer to get D2 to run...STILL get ""please insert CD-ROM play disc errors"" when the disk is in the computer...Blizzard should have not released this product until it was ready.. I notice we have 2 patches out allready and it has been on the shelves less than a month...shame on Blizzard."
3,"Better than the original, but too much fighting","This game is like the original, but better. It is much longer and actually hard. The classes are well thought out and make a big difference in gameplay. The skill tree makes the game a bit more of a true RPG. But the type of game is the same - hack and slash. Most of it is spent wandering around and clicking on enemies. If you liked Diablo, then you will like Diablo II even more. But if you enjoy real RPGs, then this game won't be your favorite."
2,i've played much better,"when i first bought the game i was very excited. when i first started i thought it was great. then as i got farther into i noticed the lack of an interesting plot. just click. click. click. if u want a true rpg, with plot,go for something along the lines of planescape:torment, or bg2. i gave this 2 stars for one reason. after having a true challenge in bg2(baldur's gate 2) it is a pleasent change of pace for about 15 min 2 just kill things"
5,Best RPG ever created,"A massive achievement in the world of computer games. This was one of the most anticipated games in 1999. I played the original Diablo and was absolutely dazzled by the storyline and creativeness of the producers. Diablo II is much better with much improved variety of monsters and realms. If you would like to know my characters, Barbarian-48, Sorcress-24, Paladin-59, Necromancer-30, Amazon-29. If you would like to trade with me, whisper to ""Demonaric"" in closed Battle.net.Graphics/Setting:B+ Incredible scenery, but the graphics are still two dimensional.Gameplay:A Awesome items, rare, unique and magical, I got 3 SOJs anyone want to trade?"
4,Good,"this game is OK, but there is only kill things, for a entreteniment is OK, but anyway buy other game how make you thing and this game too then you can have a great time"
4,diablo vs. diablo 2,"OK, here is the deal. Last night I beat star craft which was a sweet game. So i have been looking for a new game; my friends told me to get one of the diablo games. So i have been reviewing them seing which would best satisfy me. The reason i am writting this is that what i have heard is the graphics for d2 suck and that also it would require me having a voodoo 3dfx card which i dont have. And for diablo i havent heard of such thing. I will probaly end up buying both of them, but i just wanted to let everybody know that diablo is alot cheaper and also you really dont require a 3dfx card."
2,THE GAME HAS BUGS,I have been looking on Google for the past days. Most people said the game had bugs on it. Lots of people said their charaters were stolen on Battle.net. Also fantasy games are stupid. The game is not worth how much it costs.
4,"Better than the first, but PKers already in beta","The game looks good and has some nifty enhancements (a skill tree, for example, where you choose the direction in which your character's abilities grow), but it ain't the second coming. And, with PKers already infesting the beta, watch your back when you buy the retail version."
2,Beta tester hoping for relief from Everquest addiction,"but I didn't get the relief I sought. While Diablo 2 is fun for a while, it is not the immersive game I'd hoped. It could hold my attention for perhaps an hour playtime at maximum. I may buy the game, and I may play the game - most likely when the EQ servers are down, the internet is clogged, or in the unlikely event there is nothing to do at the moment in Everquest.Diablo 2 simply is a slightly upgraded via more current technology version of Diablo. Something I could do perhaps when recovering from dental surgery and on pain meds. Disengage brain, kill stuff. Fun for a while.Ahh well, the Frogloks of Old Sebilis await. Chardok... And oh joy! The Hole opened today!/returns home to Norrath. /salute"
3,Okay 4 years ago,"This game was pretty good, but I had to quit playing in preparation for the Y2K scare."
1,Can't Install the Game,I would give this game a much higher score if only I could install the game. I have been doing that for weeks trying every suggestions from Blizzard's online support relating to my problem but nothing works.
1,Spen dyour money on something else!,My friend bought this game and was and still is obbsessed with it! He kept telling me how great it was and I went over and tried it out. Big whoop all you have to do is point and click and have an IQ of at least 5. There is no point to buying this game. Now my friend bores my with long conversations on how he could make his guy better or why they are so good in the first place.P.S. This game is a waste of time and money don't get it!! Also If this form had a 0 star I would give it that!!
2,disappointed in defects,"We have not been able to play the game. There are several quirks that need to be worked out. The blizzard tech support has listed them, but does not have the solution as of yet...quite disappointing to spend so much for a game we cannot play. No, its not our system. We justed upgraded. Oh well!"
4,"Good, but not great. Had a tough act to follow.","This game is the continuation of the (in my opinion) the best RPG of its time. You have little choosing of your path, and little character development, but you WILL spend countless hours playing it. Finding items, killing monsters, taking in the ultimate of evil in the ever growing David and Goliath saga. If you played Diablo 1, this is a 3. If you never played Diablo 1, this is a 7 or 8. Diablo One was a complete triumph, this one, is a good game, but had to live up to Star Wars: Episode One like hype. If you overhype something, it will inevitably be doomed to fail. The bad news, Blizzard wanted to release all language versions at one time to limit bootlegging, thus allowing avid fans to gossip and speculate, ruining the game theoretically. Buy it. Its good. You'll beat it, you'll say you have, you'll move on. Its a good game, just overhyped and underdone. Could have been better, and less like Diablo 1. AWESOME STORY/PLOT LINES! Its worth a pick-up."
5,Better than the original!,In the annals of software history never have so few done so much for so many! Beats Half-life by a mile!
3,Like Vodka highly addictive but boring as hell,Diablo 2 is not much different from the first.This game is so addictive that it causes loss of sleep and you have dreams that your playing it and you cant quit. The graphics are pretty good but the game playing is kinda hard to understand and all you do is kill monsters and buy new weapons.This game is pretty boring but it hipnotizes you into playing it. And plus Blizzard entertainment gets all these awards and shows off about it but when i play Blizzard games they dont impress me much.
3,Not bad at all but could have been better,"Pros: excellent graphics, more challenging than the original, new spells, and good movie clips between acts.Cons: game doesnt save where you left off meaning the monsters you kill reappear; gameplay isnt smooth (i have a Athlon 750 cpu, Geforce DDR 32MB video card, 128MB PC133 SDRAM, 52X cdrom, and ASUS K7V MBoard) when there are a lot of monsters surrounding you.I expected something a little different than the original game. However, gameplay is still the same (click, click and more clicks). This game wasn't really worth the wait but it is still a pretty good game."
4,Beware!,To anyone in the US looking to buy Diablo 2.....DO NOT purchase this item!!!! They are selling the European version which DOES NOT accept the US version of the Lord of Destruction expansion. Diablo 2 fail.
2,not as good as ONE,Diablo 2 really made me mad. Number 1 you can't save anywhere along the line. When you die you go back. This may mean up to 10 or 15 minutes to get back to your site. Number 2. The game cheats. When you die it will take any gold that you have on your person and then it takes everything thing else as well. I'll stay with number one. (which is a great game)
3,Multiplayer is TERRIBLE!,"Okay, multiplayer is TERRIBLE!If you're looking to spend loads of time downloading mandatory buggy patches, and you're looking to attract obnoxious teenage boys and men with bad attitudes and personal issues, then multiplayer is definately for you. Anyone with a bad attitude can kill your character and take anything you've worked for in the game, and the bugginess of the patches randomly closes the game or kicks you out of the game.D2 has so much potential, but Blizzard and Battle.net really need to work on how well they serve their consumers, otherwise people may be wary about the purchasing of future Diablo - related products."
4,Could've been better,"Basically, this is Diablo I with more area to cover. Don't get me wrong, I like the game, but for being in development for 3 years I expected more. The new skill tree is something new, but not as cool as it sounded when they first talked about the game awhile back. Its more interesting with the new characters, but the graphics are exactly the same. I expected more roleplaying aspects that were promised, but its stilll primarily a ""hack and slash"" game. I do really like the game and is a blast with multiplayer, but I just expected more this time around."
5,Very Addictive,This game is the best game I have ever played. Once you start you can't stop. Sure after a while it gets old but it is fun while it lasts. If you stop and start again you get back into the swing of things so don't worry if something else comes along while you are half way through killing Diablo. The new characters are of a wider variety than the first game. I would recommend this game to anyone who wnats to play a long addictive role-playing game.
3,Excellent Game - Terrible On-Line Service,"The programmers and Game Designers that created this game did a great job, the game itself is very enjoyable.However if you want to play the game in a secure multiplayer environment (battle.net) forget it. The Diablo 2 on-line realms are virtually unplayable at this point due to lag, server instability, and software bugs. Blizzard has over the past few months continued to ignore the problems and has been tight lipped about communicating with customers relative to what the real problems are.If you're looking to buy a game to play in a secure (i.e. cheat/hack-free) multiplayer environment - I'd recommend skipping Diablo 2 until blizzard gets its problems fixed."
2,"D'Oh, did not live up to hipe IMO.","Ugh, I hate it when something like this happens. I get all worked up the week it is slated to come out, then I get it and am let down. The initial problem was getting it to play, which took Blizzard 2 days to get back to me. Then it was beating the game the 4th day I had it. I promtply un-installed after 3 nights of trying to get on bnet with no success. If you want a good RPG then go straight for Vampire!!!"
4,Diabolical,"Diablo 2 is in many ways the same game as Diablo 1. They did add some pretty cool features, but didn't upgrade the graphics at all. I would definitely not recommend this game to beginners. If you thought Diablo was hard, this is definitely a step higher. Hardcore gamers will, however, definitely appreciate the pure unnerving difficulty this game posseses. If you liked Diablo, of course you'll like this sequel, but maybe not as much as you might hope."
4,Nice. Cool RTS Labyrinth-Dungeons Type of Game. Fun & Many Levels.,Cool Game. Nice Price. Fairly Quick Shipping. Overall 4 out 5 Stars.Would I Reccomend this Video-Game for Teenagers (17-19) that like Mythical Dragons & Dungeons?Yes.
2,Diablo 2 CD error,"The software discs came in the mail as advertised for time required, but the 3rd disc would not install past 80%. I've retried the installation a few times and had no success. The disc appears new with no blemishes, scratches, marks etc. I've visited the Blizzard website and it appears my next option is to download the entire software license from their website as a single file and transfer to my laptop via external HD or stick memory. If that does not work I will need to order another disc set."
2,click,"Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click. That is the game in a nutshell, but with a cool plot."
2,Not so great for the single-player-oriented...,"Besides having all the system requirements necessary and still not being able to run the game, my biggest problem with it is not being able to save the game state. This completely ruins it for me--and probably for anyone else interested in the single-player aspect. It is truly awful to have to go back somewhere to get items that were perhaps left behind, only to have to fight everything that you already killed once all over again. Sadly, this ruins the game and storyline for me. I know other folks who aren't bothered by this at all, however. For me, though, it's just a terrible way to have released the game. I honestly think that they should've kept that save feature in the game, even if it meant releasing the game later."
2,"Good game, but DISAPPOINTING","Diablo 2 is a good game. That's it....a good game. After a 3.5 year wait, I was expecting a damned GREAT game. The story is uninspiring after playing the original....the art is dated, and the gameplay is not MUCH improved. If you are in desperate need of gaming (have already played the OTHER good games), get this game. If you're in the market for a GREAT game, buy Icewind Dale instead. You will not dislike this game, but great chances are that you will NOT love this game."
5,Great game,"This is one addictive game. I loved this game as soon as I started playing. Having waited so long for the sequel to Diablo, one of my all time favorites, I was not disappointed. The play control is easy to manage, the inventory is convenient, and the online games are great. Heartily recommended."
2,"Fun, but not much of an improvement","Diablo 2 is no technical marvel. It is limited to 640 x 480 in 256 colors, and doesn't have a customizable character, it has sort of limited itself. The gameplay hasn't improved much from the original, as far as I can tell. Diablo 2 simply doesn't match up to the standards that Diablo 1 helped to set. I wish I had waited until the price came down. This is not [worth the $], in my opinion."
2,Boring as crap,"One thing that bothers me about this game is it gets really boring, really fast. It takes relatively no time to finish the game, and within a few days you've already played through all 5 classes. I tried playing multiplayer with my roomate, and it still is boring really fast, not to mention how laggy it was. I was personally astounded at the price it was listed for at home, 60 bucks. That's way more than I wanna pay for a game, especially one that loses my interest so quickly.If you're borrowing this game, then I would suggest playing it until you get bored with it, otherwise, don't waste the money."
3,someplace else,richard burmer has and always will take me to another place with his music a good place a place where we all want to be
2,Awful,"I love La Traviata and adore Anna Moffo...but this was an awful ""movie"" to say the least. I baught this DVD under the impression that it was a live performance; however, it is in movie format with lip-syncing...and even that is horrible. Anna looks as if she is just speaking the words rather than singing them. The sound quality is that similar to a record player (scratchy and unclear at times). I was very much disappointed with the purchase of this DVD. You'd be better off simplying buying a CD recording of Anna Moffo's La Traviata because the acting is not that good either. Her Bel Telephone Hour video is much better...I would recomend that...it has a much better version of her La Traviata"
4,It gets the job done,"I ordered this because I had gotten the idea from 3M's site that this product was the professional series. It will do just fine, but I worry about longterm use. The clamp that holds the wrist band at a tight length is made of a thin plastic hinge that appears it could break off after repeated opening and closing. Probably best to snap it where you want it (fortunately it grips as tight as an alligator) and remove the band by sliding off the hand. Otherwise it seems a quality product."
3,WHAT? That was the last boss?,"Half-Life is the coolest game I have ever played. You know, creatures eveywhere, great strategy game, how do I get over there kinda game. Unfortunently when I played Opposing Force I was dissapointed because Half-Life was a long game while Opposing Force was so...well, SHORT! Once I beat the last boss I was so happy thinking, ""Wow that was a tuffy! Cant' wait for the next"", but then the game ended! I expected it to be a lot better than that! The thing I thought would be awsome in it was that you could lead a ""squadron"" of grunts and medics and soldiers. The most you ever get to come with you is 3. 3! That's not a squadron. The new guns were cool though. The graphics were good too but thats about it. So if you wanna get a game DON'T get this."
3,"Wow, this is great... what, it's over?","I loved the interaction and command of a fireteam (4 Marines including yourself.). I also liked the new weapons, and the sort of us-vs-them thingie that really brought the game to life. Follows faithfully in the footsteps of an all time great, Halflife. But.... I finished it in 8 hours on medium difficulty. Too short, too much money for an add-on. If they had made it a stand alone, it would have been MUCH too short. If they had made it a $25 add-on, it still would have been a little short."
4,Great Game - Terrible Graphics,"The first Half-Life was great. Graphics and puzzles were amazing. OP, however, is not as great. The graphics leave a lot to be desired. Not nearly as amazing as the first. And the puzzles are kind of easy. They are physically difficult to execute (as was the first game), but mentally easy to figure out. I remember the first game took me three months to get through (and that was with the book). Right now, I'm playing OP without the book and I'm making great time..."
4,Just as good as half life but often confusing,I Have to admit that I love This game very much. The only thing that I must stress about its gameplay is the game can sometimes be a bit confusing. The many puzzling puzzles in the game are sometimes just to difficult for me. (I dont mean to nitpick but I mean What I say) Hey! has anyone noticed the guys in business suits that keep messing You up????
5,This is a dream come true!,"Finally I get to kill all those pesky guards and sciencetists that ticked me off in the original! And best of all new guns to kill them with! Very very cool guns. And you have this little nifty alien device that you can use as a rope/grappling hook tool. This FINALLY tells you who the mysterious G-Man is and answers some of the other questions the original left you hanging to answer. And I love working with the soldier AI against the new smart-ass ""Alien Corps"" AI in furious battles. Very fun and frightening. But to some the game up in 2 simple words: BUY NOW!"
4,"Great, but a little short","For the price, I expected this to be longer. It was very well done, however. Good new weapons, monsters, plot, etc."
4,"EXCELLENT, but...","Opposing Force was a worthy add-on to Half-Life, but it is way to short. Between homework and having to go to work, I still found time to beat this game in a single weekend. Don't get me wrong, the new millitary perspective is awesome - commanding small groups of soldiers is cool and a nice variation on the Half-Life theme - it's just that it is way to short. I can't even beat the Big Baby at the end of the original Hal-Life, but I beat the monster at the end of Opposing Force in maybe 10 minutes (after I got a system down).Overall, a nice game worthy of the Half-Life name. Oh, and you guys out there who are familiar with the Black Suit Guy, you're really gonna hate him at the end of the game..."
3,Should you buy Op4?,First off I've been playing HL since 4/1/99. And I've played it every single day since then. It's simply the best shooter. But right now there is a rush of good FPS comeing in like q3 and UT... so is it worth it to pay for the HL expansion? Well I was kinda disspointed...I mean the weapons are unbalanced now to many BFG. Which make it a newbie game. And major lag on Won.Net Multiplayer servers...like 300. Some ppl I heard have a 50 mhz p3 1128 RAM TNT2 and DSL connection get up to 250 lag ick. So despite all that Its still a good game if you liked HL you probably like op4.BTW single player is short =[
4,Good stuff,"Everything about this game is well done, it's just that there isn't enough of it. When I got to the end, I was like ""What, this is all?"" But as long as you know that it's going to be short, it's still a fun play, and has some of the most creative weapons ever devised for any game. Also, I felt that the puzzles were even better than in original Halflife (not that Original's puzzles were bad!). Likewise, the new addition of squad based combat was great, even if there wasn't a lot of it. All in all, a good buy, provided you don't pay too much, and expect that it's going to be short."
1,Opposing Force,"If you want a game that is well planned, has great AI, super graphics, and an outstanding story, you will want to by Half-Life's Opposing Force. It is also great for mutiplayer."
1,"One of his worst! They need to reprint ""Way Cool!""","Hirum needs to stop singing and concentrate on just playing his guitar which he is one of the best at. For Hirum at his best, try to find ""Way Cool."" Unfortunately it is out of print, but if you can find it, it is an exceptional CD!"
3,So-so--there are better products out there.,"It also seems that you must use a lot of product to achieve noticeable results, and a lot of product means it takes longer to dry."
4,Very helpful to me,"I found this book very helpful. Most Photoshop books are too intimidating, but this not only was easy for me to follow, it also had projects that might be useful to other non-professionals. You might want to take a look at it rather than judge it by the reviews here. It may be a little pricey, but I feel like the first project I did with it, doctoring a family group photo of 15 people and 1 dog (I had to transplant open eyes to one kid's face and add a dog that was in the doggie hospital that day), made it well worth the price in personal satisfaction."
2,Good for entry level PS users,"I was somewhat as disappointed as Martin with this book. My expectation was a book with greater depth. However, I do think that an entry level Photoshop user would find it, as Marilyn did, a useful book and that's who I would recommend it to."
3,Mens Titanium Bracelet,"I wasn't very happy with this purchase. It looked a little dingy and not as shiny as it did online. My husband seems to like it and wears it everyday. So, I guess that's all that matters."
1,Lost on vacation,"I love the look of the bracelet,but the clasp did not close rigth so i lost it. Iwas very dissapiontedYour turly Alan Rosario"
5,Wonderful flatware,this is high quality wonderful flatware and I could not be happier to have it-we ordered the birds too and love them also.Wonderful value indeed.
4,"good set, but not great","This is very good set for on sale price as low as $39.99. Elegant and beatiful. But, amazon offer too many good set recently. I also purchased a $29.99 Yamazaki prince Ann 43 pc set. In terms of workmanship, i think that it is hard to tell which is better. Though I personally prefer this set, my wife like the Yamazaki, since my wife worried about many up-downs in the handle of this set may bring cleanning problems in the long run. For material, RB is heavier than Yamazaki except the knife, which is 15g lighter.This set is coming in 8 small boxes, and each contains 5 pieces. It is not in the set box as you may say in local Macys.It is a very good set, but do not be misdirected by its $500 Original price."
4,Not what I expected but still good buy.,"I thought this book would give tricks/tips on how to remember information, it doesn't. It gives you tips on how to study and numerous questions with rationales. I am still glad I bought this book and recommend it to other nursing students. I love the fact it gives you rationales of all answer choices."
4,NCLEX made incredibly easy.,There are plenty of questions to help you study for tests as well as the NCLEX exam.
4,Strong on Theory,"This book is strong on theory, and good for people who like that kind of thing. Though it took me over a week on a single page (The Earley Context Free Grammar Algorithm) to get it, it is a very good algorithm once I understood it. It explains most of the aspects of this science that are necessary, though it could have gone into more depth on the recognition and synthesis parts. I recommend buying this book only if you're very serious about learning about this subject, because it's definitely a workout for your brain."
1,This is not a speech book,This book has a good coverage on NLP but not speech. The title is misleading.
5,This product is soooo nice to have,"I'm delighted to put it simply with this product. I was purchasing single bottles, which were more expensive, and took up a lot of room to store if I purchased several at a time. This combination of the gallon no rinse shampoo, plus the full spray bottle of it are wonderful. At times when RA hits me with a vengeance, I use this hair and body shampoo when I am not able to get into a shower or tub. It is very easy to use, works wonderfully, with no residue or obnoxious scent. It's just delightful! This is what they use in the hospital now, warm towels with no rinse body shampoo on them. After my last stay in the hospital, I was very happy to find this on Amazon and I highly recommend it. Even a small bottle would be good to have on hand for times that someone in your family might be ill and not able to shower."
3,Lists lists lists,"my review title about sums it up. If you want an inventory of a pre WWI country house of a wealthy, non-titled family, this is your book."
4,LINUX Network Administrator's Interactive Workbook,This is the best book that I could find in the market if I want to learn from start to advanced level of Linux operating system.
2,Be careful before you buy - somewhat deceptive description,"This juice is a blend, not just pomegranate juice. I know it says in the details:Lakewood Organic Smart Healthy Pomegranate Juice; All-Natural; No PreservativesFresh Pressed (Not From Concentrate); 100% Organic - Certified by Florida Organic Growers and Consumers and the USDANatural Source of Antioxidants, Dietary Fiber, Phytochemical Nutrients and Essential Vitamins and Minerals...and so on, but it's a blend of apple, a couple of different types of grapes, cherry, blueberry, blackberry, lemon and so on.It tastes OK, but pomegranate is not a particularly prominent flavor in this mix."
5,Nice Flavor,"Very nice flavor. The ingredients all contribute to good health. Tried the pure pomegranate, and the taste is a bit harsh. Would be better if Lakewood clarified what percentage of the juice is pomegranate. The 100% pomegranate is approximately double the price. Perhaps this blend contains less than 50% pomegranate juice, without the vendor specifying, one is left to guess."
3,LOOK B4 U BUY! Not pure pom juice,"I was in a hurry. Based on the part of the label I could read from the web site I thought I was buying 100% pure pom juice. If you read all the verbage you will see this is just another blend of other juices. It tastes like apple/pear/pom, in that order, not 100% pom juice. I have been mixing this 50/50 with 100% pure pom juice just to get rid of the case I bought. Mixed this way it tastes just fine, but if you are looking for 100% pom juice, keep looking 'cause this isn't it. This company does make a 100% juice which is what I thought I was buying, as the labels are very similar. Their 100% juice is great, but cost more."
2,Not Pure Pomegranate Juice,"Buyer beware! This is not pure pomegranate juice. Like another reviewer I was in a hurry and wanted to get some cheap pomegranate juice for my family. This juice is a blend of apple, grape, pomegranate and other juices. Do not buy if you want pure pomegranate juice. In retrospect, it makes sense since pomegranate prices are sky high. One big pomegranate costs $3.00 at our local supermarket now!"
3,Leaves breath super sweet,"After years of using Tom's of Maine and Listerine Zero, I went back to the alcohol-based mouth wash a year ago.I noticed the difference and so did my dentist. Much less gum tenderness and bleeding (which I'm prone to despite insane dental hygiene).All the same, I don't care for the sting of the alcohol, so I tried this Crest Pro-Health for a couple weeks.1) It is very sweet. Even sweeter than the other products I mentioned above. I don't really like that first thing in the morning.2) After a week of use (which happens between flossing and brushing for me at night and before brushing in the morning), I started noticing more pink and red after flossing. This after having no gum bleeding for months and nothing else changed but for the mouthwash.Overall, found it to be o-k. I'm sure it would suffice for many people (especially those who cannot tolerate the alcohol stuff), but even if I was staying away from the 'sting' this was still too sweet for me."
3,Very Sweet--too Sweet,"I was looking for a mouthwash to freshen my breath and help keep my gums healthy without the burning sensation of other mout washes like Listerine. While this rinse doesn't burn, it's very sweet--really too sweet for my tastes--it's almost like rinsing with sugary soda. It's all very subjective, but I really don't like the taste of this mouth wash and won't get it again. If you want something very sweet tasting you should give it a try, otherwise I'd not reccomend it."
5,A PLEASANT SURPRISE,"I have used Crest Pro-Health's leading competitor for many years now. When given the oppurtunity, I decided to try Crest Pro-health. I've been pleasantly surprised. Crest Pro-health has a pleasing , cleansing taste. I've been using it twice a day and find that it works to control mouth odors. Its ingredients also kill bacteria. This is a boon to placque control and maintenance of oral health. If you haven't tried Crest pro-health, I urge you to do so. You won't be disappointed."
5,Love this mouthwash!,This is a great mouthwash. It doesn't have that burn you usually associate with mouthwash because it is alcohol free. It tastes great and leaves your breath feeling clean and fresh long after use. What I like best is that it doesn't leave a weird after taste the way some mouth washes do. I recommend.
2,Beware in high pressure areas.,"Aquasana filter are only rated for 50psi. Mine cracked - twice - the second time ruining my kitchen floor (many similar stories found on the internet). Great water, but low pressure installs only."
3,MJC,"Overall I thought the book was okay (the dvd was great), I would of like to learn more about Dan's thoughts on the nfl and some more personal stories of the locker room and training camp experiences he had. The book has a lot of great photos."
2,Even liter funk,"This is basically the same review I wrote for Spaces and Places, but there isn't too much difference between the two to be honest. Some people have obviously fallen pretty hard for Mr Byrds music, but unfortunately I'm not convinved of it's earth moving capabilities. Apart from the awesome Ethiopian Knights, I've found the rest of his work, and the work of his student group the Blackbyrds, very much the trim version of what funk is all about. It's pleasant, but veers dangerously close to muzak at times. The lyrics are too trite and he tends to turn to an extremely irritating whistle throughout some of the tracks as a kind of melody insturment which just drives me nuts. Hugely influencial in the 90s obviously, but sounding dated again only a few years after."
5,"""Stepping Into Tomorrow is the Right Title""","I had this on 8-track back in the seventies and I never forgot about it. Someone stole it out of my house and I was heart-broken. I was only 14-years-old at the time and, I loved Donald Byrd then, and now. At age 43, Byrd definately stepped into tomorrow with this album because it sounds just as good today as it did then. The sax's and Byrd's trumpet have some of the most soothing, melodic tones you'd ever want to hear. The vocals are also excellent. I played it for my friend and he fell in love with it too. That's why I have a lot of double orders with Amazon because my partner likes what I like,and I find myself ordering a second copy later and shipping it to him. And ladies, ""Think Twice"" is something we only wish we had the nerve to say sometimes....that's usually the man's favorite saying. The entire album is sexy; mellow at times and upbeat at others. If you like horn instruments, you'll love this one!"
1,...,"NOTE: This CD does NOT faature the 1962 original Hit version of the 'Title' Song: DO YOU LOVE ME!!!There is also a 1981, 1988 Mowtown CD ""MOTD-5415"" which has a very poor, and 'Disco-style' Unoriginal 6:33 minute reissue 1st track DO YOU LOVE ME. This CD, MOTD-5415 is a 1981, 1988 compilation. If you want the real Genuine song ""DO YOU LOVE ME""Do NOT purchase this CD. ..."
5,Best Joker's card,This is my favorite joker's card. It has the best songs on it and you ain't down wit the clown if you don't got the Ringmaster!
5,Thousands of Dead Souls Covered in Wax...,"This was the first ICP album I got, and ranks as my favourite. The beat in ""Wax Museum"" is catchy beyond belief and a straight up awesome song.A definite must-buy, and if you can get your hands on the original print, DO SO!"
2,Too much rap for my taste,"I don't really care for early ICP, they were too much into rap back then. I know that's the way it should have always been, but it just isn't for me. When ICP started getting into rock and metal with their third album ""Riddlebox"" they became awesome and found their true sound they were searching for in this album and the one previous to this one ""Carnival of Carnage"". Which I like ""Carnival"" better. ICP kicks ass, especially now, but this just isn't my favorite of their albums."
5,The second Joker&#65533;s Card&#65533;CLASSIC!,"The Ringmaster is a WICKED CD! Ringmaster is a masterpiece consisting of totally awesome lyrics, catchy beats, and hilarious catch phrases. It also contains several hits such as ""Chicken Huntin"", ""Mr. Johnson's Head"", ""Southwest Song"", and ""Wagon Wagon"". Ringmaster is worth every penny...and then some.Much Clown Love to all the Juggalos and Juggalettes who are reading this. Stay down with the Wicked Clowns 4 LIFE!PEACE!"
2,"I dont hate ICP, I just hate this album.","Insane Clown Posse has made some good albums, such as The Great Milenko and the Amazing Jeckel Brothers, but this one is pretty bad. Its boring,odd, and dull. I dont love really any of the songs, and some of the subject matter is even disturbing(listen to 'Who Asked You'). I only had two laughs during this cd, and they werent even huge ones. I dont hate ICP, like I said, I just hate this cd. I would reccomend the Great Milenko instead. Even the Wraith Shangri La is better than this garbage. This is probably the worst Insane Clown Posse album. Even juggalos might want to buy at their own risk cause you might not like this one either."
4,Shorty WikkiD phoenix ninja givin props,"Wud up ya'll Shorty WikkiD ya'll . Forks up forks down.JRB 4 life . me and my homie are showin up ta psychopathic records as soon as i turn 18 we gonna be ""DA 6 FACE RIDDLAZ"" I hope u ninjaz and stonaz buy when it hits. ICP gave dis ninja life to me so down wit ICP foe life . WOOOOOOOOP WOOOOOOOOOOOOP MCL ya'll stay up . peace"
4,ICP at their best,"In my opinion,This is ICP's best CD they have ever made.This has their old skool style that you can't hear on ""Great Milenko"" or ""The Amazing Jeckel Bros.""...This has ICP classics on it such as ""Murder Go Round"",""Chicken Huntin'"",Mr.Johnson's Head"",,""Bugz On My Nugz"",and ""Wagon,Wagon"".They were raw as hell on this album,This CD has funny stuff,scary stuff,weird stuff,everything you know and love about ICP is on here.This is a classic ICP CD and I recommend any ICP fan get this."
1,You could buy anything better than this.,"There are far too many young people listening to this music who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
1,Reatarded rap...,"ICP is one of the worst bands I've ever heard, they are right up there with linkin park, nsync, and all that no talent [stuff.] I don't like rap, and I ceratinly don't like icp. 'Hey let's rap about killin people and juggalos and every rap cliche possible'. Please, just end it. I mean, just look at the fans, the juggalos. Depressed goth/punk teenagers. Perhap's that is just a genralization, but that's what I see when I look at the juggalos in ym school. It's a sorry sight. I'm sorry, but I like talented, solid, and unique musicianship; and there certainly isn't any here."
5,Still the best Joker's Card,"With the recent release of _Bizaar_/_Bizzar_, I went back through the older ICP albums to see how they've held up. This album is STILL completely off the hook. Great beats, great lyrics, forgotten freshness abounds on this CD. From the creepy drone of ""The Dead One"" to the turbo shuffle of ""Who Asked You?"" to the brutal thump of ""Murder Go Round"", ""My Fun House"" and ""Wagon Wagon"", this album's got something for everyone. If you can only buy one past ICP release, make sure it's this one: it's their finest moment."
5,"WICKED RHYMES, WICKED TIMES!!","Come on here....this is ICP!! This album is awesome! I don't think there is a bad song on this record. And before people want to diss ICP (""A music fan from Chico, CA"") they should know what they're talking about...millions of ICP fans can't be wrong!!!"
4,This Album is the ****!,"Bugz on My Nutz is the best ICP song ever except for Cotton Candy which is the ****. Ringmaster is ok as a whole album if you really want an ICP album Pick Up Riddlebox. But Ringmaster has ICP classics like the Loons, Wagon, and Love Song. Pick this up if you down with the Clown!!!"
3,it's not my favorite but its still ICP,this is my least favrite ICP album i only liked 9 out of the 16 songs and the ringmasters word sucked but hey its still ICP and I'm gonna listen!
4,good classic icp stuff,This is a good cd i liked it alot. very old school but still catchy and at times very humorous. i bought this thinkin i will only be able to listen to it like 3 times and it would get old but ive had it for about a year and a half now and i still listen to it. a great buy and worth the money.
5,Scary dude =\,Ok now I want all of you juggalos that have this CD to sit in a dark room with no light and put Ringmaster's Word on repeat and listen to it 3-7 times? What happens? Strange stuff! I swear this CD got me believing in the dark carnival Ringmaster is real and Ringmaster's Word actually let's you invoke him if you listen to it in the dark....
1,Plain Trash,"This CD is not only sickening, it is a waste of money. Pure trash that is just a bunch of swearing and meaninglessness. If you want a good CD, try the Doors or another classic band. If you are into rap, try Puff or B.I.G. Don't waste your money on this."
5,Encyclopedia of FengShui by Lillian Too,"I read a few other books before I found Lillian's Too's book. This encyclopedia has helped me put everything together. I got so confused to have read different FS, there's the Indian FS, the Western FS, the Japanese FS, I also was surfing the net and just read whatever was there. Thanks to Lillian, it all then finally made sense why other FS contradicted each other. It's also good to know that you can also use FS principles/cures from other FS as above in different rooms in your house. This is an excellent excellent book, anyone starting in FS should not be without."
1,Encyclopedia of Feng Shui,"I am certainly agreed with "" a reader from San Francisco"". I have almost all of Lilian Too's Feng Shui Books and a recently bought her EoFS. I have found her recent publications are nothing, but just a repetition of her previous books. Certainly a great disappointment from a master! Please Lilian don't published just for the sake of publishing!"
5,The Most Comprehensive Book I have ever come across,"I would like to thank Lillian Too for the most fabulous book on Feng Shui that I have ever come across. The author has taken great pain in explaining the details, with illustrations and pictures, on all pages. Each and every page of this book is worth its weight in gold!Keep up the good work!!"
5,Illustrated Ency. of Feng Shui: The Complete Guide to the Art and Practice of Feng Shui,One of Lillian Too's best books. Good for beginners and for those with some knowledge. Found it very helpful and easy to understand.
1,Not good for Volvo 1800,"This book is not a good book for the Volvo 1800 series. Sure, it has some mechanical and electrical information, but VERY LITTLE other than what overlaps the 120 and 130. It appears to me that Haynes added a few paragraphs (and I mean literally a few) just so they could put ""plus P1800"" on the cover.I was extremely disappointed in the lack of specific 1800 series diagrams and info.Definately would NOT make this purchase again."
1,Just a head's-up,"This book is not a critical study of Rousseau's Emile, nor is it even the whole work itself. It's only a digest of the work, containing selections from Emile. Just thought I should point that out to any potential buyers."
2,"Text Book of ""Futures""","A concise guide to what futures are and an introduction to the mechanism of futures trading. Its definition is more official than the ones you probably find in websites. It is outdated by the automation of a lot of the processes mentioned in the book.This book could be a great teaching tool for high school students who are interested in knowing what futures are. The outdated parts would not change the underlying principles of futures trading thus the value of the book is still there.If it is ten years ago, I would give this book at least 4 stars as it delivers clearly what futures are."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Wonderful story. I picked this up last night and couldn't put it down... it was written in 1985 - before the breakup of the Soviet Union.. in some ways, this dates the story and the actions of the CIA and the Probe researchers. It is easy enough to overlook though and does not distract from the main focus of the story - the struggle to unlock the mystery of one women's mind. Well worth the read."
1,Sony SDT-9000/PB 24 GB Capacity DDS-3 Internal Tape Drive,"I recently purchased this Sony SDT-9000/PB 24 GB Capacity DDS-3 Internal Tape Drive (Sold by: Nadia Lee)The tape drive worked after I removed the face plate of the drive. Two tapes and a clean tape got destroyed during the process before I realized that it was the face plate causing the issue.When consulted with seller, the response was""As listed in the above item description the tape drive was sold as is no warranty. If the tape is hanging on the faceplate you can try altering the plate so the tape will eject freely, try a new tape and see if it hangs on ejection, or just leave the faceplate off. Hopefully one of the above tips does the trick. Glad to hear that the drive works.Thanks,Amy Lee ""I will not recommend to purchase any device from this seller.I had good experience with Amazon.comSincerely.sk"
1,Extremely disappointed,"My daughter received this much-desired toy as an early Christmas gift from her grandmother. The product looked nice in the ad and we believed Breyer to be a good name. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The quality is horrible -- the plastic is incredibly cheap and the pieces do not stay together. Every door and shutter falls off constantly when touched (even slightly) and the fence pieces do not stay together. In the three days she has had the toy, it has done nothing but upset and frustrate her."
2,Came with no instructions and is not very sturdy,"My daighter received this item for Christmas. It didn't come with any directions on where to put the stickers, I had to look online to see what the heck the blue circle sticker was. It also came with 2 little white plastic pieces with 2 little holes in them and I still have no idea what they are for. I know most of the assembly is self explanatory, but I've never seen a toy come without any instructions at all. This toy is chintzy and not what I expected from Breyer."
4,Seashells Sea Stars,"Bought the Kindle version and although it was black and white, provided the information for the Ocean Week report that we needed. It was great to be able to have right at your fingertips so quickly and not have to wait for the mail."
4,Interesting Read for Kiddos,"This was bought for my 5 year old son, who was super curious about all things sea-related after a trip to the beach. Great reference material!"
2,Cheap plastic,"You won't see these in symphony hall or in the hands of any headline performer, but if you have a kindergarten band or very casual group wanting to play for fun, these are your maracas. (so to speak)"
1,not satisfied,the item i was sent did not fit and i sent it back. i was never given a option for the correct item.
5,nice product,"this is a nice product it shows fish to the sides of boat,and even fish behind structure.i have two fish finders on my boat the other covers a wide area beneath the boat, so pretty much all available area is covered. the wide side is really good in shallow water,where a regular transducer is useless. the seller was priced good and delivered promptly."
1,Simplistic and Dull,"No child over 7 will find this dull, flat and uninspiring DVD the least bit compelling. My 10 year old son, who enjoys magic greatly, was terribly disappointed. He thought the tricks were babyish and the kids juvenile -- hardly meant for older kids as touted in review."
4,Greg,"This was a beautiful compilation from the 1960's. Vasilis Tsitsanis re-recorded many of his classic songs from the 1930's and 1940's by the current popular artists of the late 1950's and this CD brings many of them together. Kazantzidis, Poly Panou, Ketty Grey and Grigoris Bithikotsis give you updated versions of these songs that are still classics today."
1,The Stickmen stole their name from another band....,"I'm afraid to inform these guys that they may have a copyright infringement suit on their hands, for I was recently shown a CD by a PA band called the Stickmen from 1981-1983. The CD was a re-release of the now defunct group's work. That is how I found these guys, and I thought whoever needs to know, should. Anyway the Stickmen are a ground breaking band that make boring crap like this look as dated as they sound fresh. Too bad this band has such a limited scope, perhaps they should have done a more exstensive search for band names. Even if they don't get sued, they suck for not being able to come up with their own band name.... I was thinking of starting a band and calling it Pink Floyd...."
3,Celebrate Teachers Tote,"Tote bags are fairly simple. This one lived up to all of my expectations except that it showed a picture of a lot of goodies in it! Sad to say, the tote bag arrived with nothing in it. I wish they had included some sort of message that explained that the Celebrate Teachers totebag did not include the items that were shown. Be careful and if it seems too good to be true, it is."
5,Cool!,"""Make It Talk"" answers ""Stand Up In It"" by Theodis..love it! All the tracks on here are good...even the instrumental ""Red Onions"". ""All Blues Saturday"" should be a hit too."
3,"Pretty, but don't fit.","These shoes are pretty but they do not fit my wide feet. My somewhat squared off toes could barely squeeze into the band across the top. I will see if my friend can wear them. If you have narrow feet and/or feet that fit well into pointy-toed shoes, these might be good for you."
5,This Series is a MUST Buy!,"Ever since I read the Forbidden Game Series in 7th grade, I have never forgotten these books. I am in college now and something sparked my memory of these books. I re-read them and was again brought into the fantasy world of Julian and the Shadow World. I loved the plot! This series and the other L.J. Smith books I have read are very well-written and creative. I loved the thought of a sexy guy from another world watching over me. I did begin to resent Tom a little, I wish Jenny would have gone with Julian who obviously loved her more. I would recommend this series and all other L.J. Smith books. These books are definitely worth buying!"
4,Much better than I expected,"I came across L.J. Smith's name on one of the Twilight forums. Her books were regarded very highly, so I decided to give one of her series a try. My first available book happened to be The Hunter, first in The Forbidden Game trilogy.In a few words, this is a story about Jenny, an ordinary good girl, and Julian, a ""Dark Prince"" who is in love with her. To lure Jenny in his world, Julian tricks her and 6 of her friends to play The Game, where all of them have to face their most horrific nightmares. If they win, they are free to go. If they lose, Jenny has to stay with Julian forever.This is a very well written book, characters are very real and relatable. Like many other reviewers, I found Julian extremely attractive in a dangerous way.I highly recommend this book to anybody interested in YA fantasy and can't wait to read second part of the trilogy, The Chase."
5,Read this now!,"I have read all of L.J. Smith's books, and the Forbidden Game series is my favorite. It is definitely one of those books you can't put down! When I borrowed the series from one of my friends, I just locked myself in my room all day and read them, one after the other. My brother asked if I was becoming a hermit"
2,Not what I expected,"I expected short stories or legends from Native Speakers of the Spanish language. Instead it's a few words of wisdom from selected Hispanics talking about their childhood, etc. They are mostly first, second or third generation Americans of Hispanic heritage. I expected something more authentic in order to gain more insight into the Hispanic Culture. I also thought the book was in Spanish, but it's written in English."
3,Ken Rex McElroy,"Faithful account of idle happenstance in rural Missouri and the onset of 'big bully' upon the innocent townsfolk. Intense if illogical book delves into the life of a dog breeder and rustler who carries thousands of dollars around?!? His pretty blond teenage wife bemoans, crying in front of the press, his fate.., earlier she's raped by him?!? Idiocy well written, worth an Edgar though?!?"
1,Pure Crap,"I lived in Skidmore for many years before, after and at the time of the shooting. Trust me this is the biggest piece of crap ever, with the exception of the other book about Skidmore, ""Judgment Day"". I didn't live in fear of Ken Rex or anyone else. I left town just minutes before the shooting, so I know something about the saga. I saw the ""60 Minutes"" episode and the movie of this book. I've never laughed so hard in my life. Don't believe anything you read. There is a reason no one from the town talks about it. We're to damn embarrassed!"
5,In Broad Daylight,"I live within 50 miles of Skidmore, Mo. I was 12 years old when the shooting happened.I remember watching scenes from Skidmore on Channel 2 news out of St. Joseph Mo the day of the shooting.The book tells the story quite well. If you have a picturesque mind, what you imagine as you read is how the town really looks. I have friends from Skidmore that were affected by Ken Rex one way or another and to this day if they know who did it they don't say a word.That's what makes rural America different from the big city. Justice will be done using the civil system or your own."
4,The Skidmore saga continues...,"If you've watched the news lately, you've probably heard about Skidmore. It's where the woman was killed and her baby was stolen from her womb.But Skidmore got its notoriety in the 1980s when a man was killed in front of a group of people. ""In Broad Daylight"" details that story in its chilling entirety. Probably not since the West Memphis Three has there been a crime involving ordinary citizens so compelling. It lacks all the glitz and glamor of the OJ or Robert Blake cases, but I think it has so much more to say. A great study in vigilante justice."
4,Why did it take so long?,"McElroy should have been killed long before July 1981. Apparently, he never intimidated the right people outside of Skidmore. Should have killed his attorney too!"
4,the true story,"I thought this book was great, and I have a little trouble with all the reviews blasting the townspeople for taking matters into their own hands. My family lived in northwest Missouri at the the time, mere minutes from Skidmore. McElroy terrorized that town for decades and the law didn't help the people because that scum had a good attorney who was able to weasel him out of it. Everyone knew what he did- setting houses on fire if someone crossed him, raping the young girls, and slitting the throat of an elderly man. The townspeople did what the law failed to do for decades- take care of the problem. Even local law enforcement admit it a was a screw up. Of course, you can't understand if you've never had to live with it. Read the book with some perspective-put yourself in the townspeople's place"
2,in broad daylight,Very engrossing book. but very disappointing at the end because the author seemed confused who was ultimately responsible and seemed too sympathetic for certain people who didn't deserve it. I liked the movie better.
3,It was okay,"It was good, but I had to refer to the pics in the book to figure out who the people were that was being talked about during the story of the book."
5,Superior research & writing!,"Harry MacLean could have delivered a run-of-the-mill crime story, but instead he researched and wrote a superb book that tells the outrageous true story of a 10-year-long saga involving small-town locals, a diabolical resident and how the collective minds of a small town snap.This is a page-turner beautifully rendered that leaves readers at once exhilarated and exhausted!A super piece of work."
4,horrible format on Kindle,"However, the story is mesmerizing. I am almost through with the book and found the story fascinating. After reading this, I have every intention of finding out more about this murder and Ken McElroy. It surely held my interest. If not for the mess of a load on Kindle, this book would have been a perfect true crime book, my favorite genre."
4,Bully Exposed,"Though this book dragged in places (I skimmed a lot of the overdone descriptions of farming and weather), overall it was a fascinating read. The author was masterful at telling the complete story from how the town got into such a desperate situation to the resolution. One word of caution for Kindle readers, the formatting was awful and definitely took away from the reading enjoyment."
2,Hard to follow,"This was a free book and the title intrigued me. I love the True Crime genre but this guy is no Ann Rule. The constant framing device of what the crops were doing got on my nerves and could have been much shorter. Also, the chronology of the events and the ever-expanding cast of characters was extremely hard to follow. I would very much have appreciated maps of the surrounding area since much of the events happened within a range of several towns, all of them described as places 'unto themselves'.Many reviews of this book tend to take glorify the deed of the anonymous killers and at least the author did not take sides one way or the other but tried to get readers to think about the consequentces of taking the law into one's own hands, no matter how lawyers, judges and ridiculous ancient laws work against you."
3,Read like a police report,"The story was interesting especially since I am from Indiana but really dry. I usually ""feel"" the characters or ""hear"" their voices as I read along. This read like a report."
2,Terrible Editing,"The story of this true crime is very detailed, which for those who want all that is great; however the adaptation from print book to ebook is appalling. Several times there are only a couple of words on a page in the middle of a chapter. I would have given this book a better review, but the lack of editing overshadowed the story itself."
2,Not my favorite.,Interesting topic. not my favorite. written more like a news article than a novel. i would not recommend it to anyone.
3,drags,"While I love reading true crime books, this one really drags. Though very interesting events, it could have been told in half the book. It did appear the writer needed to fill enough pages to make it into a book perhaps. Several times I almost put it down. Again, the story is fascinating but the writing drags it out. Just when I would be ready to give it up, finally, something new would be introduced to keep me reading but it was work at times."
3,Broad Daylight,The law enforcement should be ashamed. The community should have never had to deal with such a person. Just unreal.
4,In Broad Daylight by Harry Maclean,"I remember when this happened and it seemed at the time, that a small farming community was held hostage by this outrageous individual and it finally reacted. This book is so much more. It shows the methodical and long standing dismantling of the town with no consequences for heinous unlawful acts, the total disregard for the law and the inability or unwillingness at times, of the law to push back on this individual. That the town reacted as they finally did showed not a vigilante act, but rather a basic kill or be killed reaction. I hope this town over the years has had some measure of peace. It was not what they wanted, but what they were forced to do."
4,Review of a killing in broad daylight,"Very interesting story. As you have opportunity to read this story it makes you think about why the legal system favors the criminal elements so much. IF the legal system had functioned to protect the innocents, the bad guy in the story would not have ended up dead in the middle of the small town. It also makes you wonder why folks hadn't shot the bad guy the first time he brandished a weapon and threatened people. All pedophiles should be dealt with in a similar fashion when the legal system fails to protect the population. Good read."
4,Holds your interest until the end,"Slow at first,but once you got into the book you really wanted to know what would happen next. enjoyed a lot"
3,In Broad Daylight (Crime Rant Classics) HARRY N. MACLEAN,"This tale is interesting especially since it is true. I liked that it followed up to 2008 so that the reader got an idea of 'who done it', but without a definitive answer. It was an interesting topic and began the ""What would you do"" conversation around our house. Bullies are bullies at any age and shouldn't be tolerated. This story truly shows us the need for anti-stalking laws.I am disappointed that on my kindle there were blank pages, half pages and there were a lot of typos. Had this been a paperback I'd have sent it back. That being said I read on because I just needed to know if they got the bugger and it was easier to flip the flawed pages on my kindle than it ever would have been in a paperback."
4,In Broad Daylight,I always enjoy true crime stories. I could not believe how many years this man got away with everything he was doing that was against the law. His bullying and the strange hold he had over all the different women in his life was unbelievable. If you like true crime stories I think you will like this book.
5,Brings back such great memories....,My mother bought this cd for me when I was a toddler (about 30 years ago!) and I grew up singing the wonderful songs that teach a child about loving nature and the world around you. I have such great memories of growing up whenever I hear these songs. Great CD for any child in your life....teach your children to respect everything living!
4,"FUN TO LISTEN CD,S BUT","THE 2 CD,S ARE FUN TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE OF JIMMY.S OWN RENDITIONS OF CLASSIC SOUL SONGS.BUT I DID ORDER THIS SET FOR THE DVD.BECAUSE OF THE REGION OF THE WORLD IT WAS COMING FROM I FIGURED I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY IT ON MY DVD PLAYER.I PUT THE DVD IN BOTH MY COMPUTER AND DVD PLAYER AND NEITHER WOULD PLAY IT.A REGION FREE DVD PLAYER IS NEEDED.IF YOU ARE NEW TO JIMMY BARNES MUSIC BE SURE TO GET ""BARNSTORMIN,TWO FIRES AND FREIGHT TRAIN HEART."
2,DVD AWOL,"AS I ALREADY MENTIONED SEVERAL DAYS AGO THE TWO CD'S SOUND GREAT, BUT THE DVD IS NOWHERE TOO BE FOUND. THE PERSON LOADING THESE DISC BOXES MUST NEED FURTHER TRAINING. THERE IS A CENTER SPINDLE HOLDER, BUT NO DISC. I BOUGHT THIS PACKAGE MOSTLY FOR THE DVD, SO I'M HOPING THE COMPANY COMES THROUGH AND SENDS THE DVD ASAP. I PROBABLY WILL CHANGE THIS REVIEW TO A 4 OR 5 STAR RATING IF THE DVD COMPARES TO THE CD'S."
1,Waste of Money,Don't waste your money on this terrible DVD. The title is deceiving; there are almost no bloopers in it. Instead the DVD is filled with boring interviews and staged pranks that put my baseball loving 11-year-old son to sleep within 20 minutes.I gave it one star because there is no choice for zero stars.Spend your money on something else.
3,"OK, but not great","This was somewhat funny, but I wouldn't call it great. My 10-year-old liked it a lot. I thought it dragged quite a bit, not very fast-paced. Too many repeats of the same theme. Would have liked to have seen a lot more on-field bloopers & funny plays."
5,MLB Bloopers DVD review,"This DVD was better than I could have asked for. It uses footage from the tv show This Week In Baseball [TWIB], and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of America's Pastime. It goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including Tim Hudson, Ryan Dempster, select Phillies players, & many others, as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as Tommy Lasorda and Yogi Berra. If you love TWIB's ""How 'Bout That"" section of the show, you will adore this DVD.As far as I can tell, every major league team is shown, though some have the spotlight on them more than others. This is a must have for any baseball fan. It's by far one of the best MLB DVDs released in a long time."
1,Not funny,"Not funny; not recommended. Rather than actual bloopers, the vast majority of this video is baseball players clowning around. Unfortunately, this is like watching a bunch of wanna-be stand-up comics doing stand-up. Occasionally, one will be actually funny, but most, though they surely wanna be, aren't."
3,Age-appropriate fun,"This video was a gift for my 13 year old grandson, a passionate baseball afficianado! He thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others"
1,"Lack of objectiveness is tiring, unmoving.","Fodeman's book is quite dull and unsubtle...a piece of Republican paraphernalia more than an insightful text.Those that already have the same ideas as the author, that the eyes and ears of America's pre-college youth have been forever stained by the last presidential administration, may be gleeful and content with this student's argument and may be able to ignore the mediocrity in the quality of writing itself. Readers who disagree or are unsure about the topic will learn nothing new from this book, and will most likely be turned off by the huge and unwavering amount of bias.Perhaps those who already know from the book's title that they are going to agree with the author should just give the amount you would pay for this book to the Republican party instead and save yourself from indulging in such a boring, uninspired book?"
1,I Fear the Future,"The author (obviously a House Manager-In-Training) needs to grow up and think for himself. Hopefully REAL life experience, a healthy dose of reality and much-needed maturity will knock him down a few notches."
1,All Americans favor good morals,"As a member of the older generation, I am always pleased when I hear tell of a young fellow, here and there, who defends good American morals. But I am puzzled by the boy's style of argument. It is this way:Young Justin says, rightly I believe, that people learn their morals by example. Has Justin and his friends changed the way they act, because of the way the President of the United States has acted? He does not say so. Then why does he complain about the bad moral example set by this wild President? If Justin is so good that he knows right from wrong, no matter what, then how about other boys. My boy is a good boy, as far as I know, and he votes for the Democrats.And if he has changed the way he acts, and does all these bad things that he writes about, especially with bad girls, then how does he have the right to talk. It would prove his point, and good, but who is he to talk?This is too much preaching for me.Review by O. J. Haney"
3,Published,"This book is published by Publish America, not self published as a previous reviewer mistakenly declared. Publish America is not exactly Random House. But it is a far cry from self publishing. We wonder how many books the reviewer from Westport has ever had published."
5,Youthful Author's wisdom exposes Bill and Hillary's scam,"Jason Fodeman demonstrates an unusually keen insight for a 17 year-old in his excellent expose of the Clinton Presidency. With literary precision he details facts surrounding the numerous scandals which characterized the Clintons during the President's two terms. Mr. Fodeman's contrast between the values imparted to him by his parents and grandparents which influence so much of who he is, with the Clinton's values for power, money, exploitation, greed, and lying, is striking. Page after page startles the reader into an awareness of how vulnerable young people could have been influenced so negatively by such powerful and influential people as the Clintons. Mr. Fodeman's style of writing and youhtful insights make this an appealing book for people of all ages who seek to understand the Clinton's influence on our culture."
1,Passion & Ignorance,People like Jason Fodeman should be refused publication. His political bias (to which he is certainly entitled) is only exceeded by his lack of evidence and perspective and his ignorance of history. Anyone who knows any American history or has lived more than 10 years more than this kid will consider his writings the rants of an ignoramus.
2,Chemical wipes!!,"For some reason I thought this product was a made with natural based ingredients, which it is not. There is alot of chemicals in the ingredients and it is not biodegradeable. If you are not concerned about this I'm sure it's a fine product. The way it was packaged also made the lid pop open during shipping and the wipes were dryed out. I called the company and they sent me a new one no problem, great customer service."
3,soap opera version of monty clift,"this book has a few redeeming qualities but overall it is a book written to fit robert laguardia's belief that monty was some sort of god cast out of heaven due to his own hysterical behavior.there is very little in depth knowledge regarding films or montys approach to acting, only vague stereotypes meant to fit in laguardias angle.i highly suggest you read Patricia Bosworths bio. still in print. she actually knew him and is partial in her writing. one more thing the only other book r.la guardia wrote was a book about the days of our lives soap opera."
4,Blu-Ray Review,I liked this movie better than The Expendables. It was more suspenseful and based on true events. The Blu-Ray quality was very good too. The extras are good too.
4,"Nice variety, not a lot of bleeding. But watch out if you use a carbon copy phone book at work!","I enjoy these pens a lot. The color variety is nice. You get some deep solid colors (black, blue, dark green) that can be used for serious writing and some fun lighter colors (pink, light purple, cyan) for other things. One thing I like is that the yellow, orange and pink are actually useable. More times than not I usually have to ditch these colors because the don't show up enough on paper, but not with these pens. There is good contrast.My only problem is that I use a phone book at work that makes a carbon copy of what I write and I can't use these pens in it. They just don't apply the needed pressure to make the copy (yes, I could push harder but I don't need a feathery tipped awful pen). So if you want a great pen that keeps a nice consistant line and don't need to push hard on a phone book thing, you are all set."
5,Paper Mate flair point guard porous point pens,I love these markers. I couldn't believe I could order them on Amazon at a cheaper price. I can't wait to use them for school.
5,Love!,I use these for journalling. I love that they don't bleed through and that I get the whole rainbow for a much more affordable price than markers. They're perfect for adding some colorful fun to your journalling or letter-writing.
1,Bad design,Ordered this unit December 04. Good thing it had a two year warranty. Mine has been replaced twice. The connector for the headphone jack breaks and the actual jack falls inside the plastic body. Keep your receipt. The RMA process is kind of complicated.
1,"DON'T GET THIS JUNK, it breaks, no customer service","I got two of these last year for our family, it worked great the first day, then the ear phone port broke on one, the other lasted only a few days longs. I called the company and found almost no customer service, they said I had to deal with the company directly, but offered no other help (like how to contact them). They both ended up in the garbage and we were out the money. This year we are spending a few more bucks and getting from a reputable company. If there were minus stars, I would give them a -10"
5,Great for the price!,"This product works great to pick up my two bullies poop, i love not having to get close to it. So far there have been no problems, but i have only owned it for a month."
5,Great tool for one of those less than desirable jobs!,"I purchase two scoops to help out the superintendent in the bldg. where I reside. Although our municipality mandates dog owners to pick up their dogs' waste ... well, you know how that goes - some do, some don't. I removed an extraordinarly large amout of dog waste (filled a small waste paper basket). It's still winter in these parts, and the scoop held up very well with frozen waste and cold soil. I could see that some unintended soil (maybe grass or flowers) might come along with the waste. We don't have a real lawn (just what ever grass manages to grow without assitance), so this scoop worked our very well for us. worth the money."
1,Don't waste your money,"We've been through two of these (not necessarily this brand) in the last six months (after paying full price--$25--at the local pet store.) Since these are made entirely of plastic, including the hinges that hold the scoop together, they break very easily. It just takes one knock and the knob breaks, rendering it useless. I am now shopping for something made of metal...probably the spoon and ""fork"" style scoop unless there's a ""jaws"" style scoop in metal."
2,Unimpressed by Scooper,"This scooper has weak springs, barely scoops--leaves a lot of waste behind. Too gross to return. Would not recommend.Completely overpriced."
1,Do not buy a plastic scooper.,"I have gone through three plastic scoopers (among them this product) and they just don't last. Sooner or later, and it seems like it's sooner, the cheap plastic gives out and snaps somewhere and the thing is useless. Shop around and find one made of metal. Otherwise, this will be an ongoing expense."
5,no excessive bending,you dont have to bend to excessively and it can pick up more than one doggie dump which is nice.
3,Ergonomic but not perfect,"I bought this scooper primarily because I've got two big dogs and lots of dog crap to pick up in the back yard. This scooper does feel much better on my hands than other scoopers I've used (I also have the ""combing"" kind). However, forget about using this in grass taller than 2 inches. I have a hard time picking the stuff up and this scooper also rips up a lot of grass at the same time."
2,needs tweeking,"I have used this product for over a year, it works ok when you first cut the lawn but other than that its a piece of crap!!!!! if the lawn is just a little too long or the lawn is to thick forget it, don't even try to pick it up when its cold out, the springs on the unit are way to weak, they need to supply more tension to the scoop portion of the unit. Another problem is, if you get to much build-up in the scoop section it makes it much harder to pick up anything. There isn't enough spring back tension to break up what is already in the scoop portion."
3,Needs more powerful spring,Product has a less powerful spring that one I bought at a pet store. I don't expect this to last more than a year of daily use.
4,It Works,No problems with this pooper-scooper. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel it could be just a tad larger so it could hold more poop.
3,okay,I got this when I hurt my back recently so that I wouldn't have to bend over. But it's short and I still have to bend and I still feel my back ache when using it.
3,It looks like it will do the job but is a bit heavy!,"wanted this to carry with me on our long and semi long walks in case my back kicks out or acts up. this is a bit heavy to carry and i figure i would have to put it in a back pack to take it with me. that being said however, the purpose for which it was created would demand a heavier piece than what i would like to carry. cant say it works. got it as insurance. my neigbhbors expect me to 'pick up' and i would too, and i dont need it until my back starts hurting."
2,Not very strong or sturdy,"This is the second scooper of this kind I have purchased through Amazon. I was very happy with the first one, but unfortunately it didn't survive the Winter. (Shouldn't have kept it outside, but who wants a poop coated tool indoors? :) )When I went to purchase another, the original was no longer available, so I chose this one. (It looked fine in the picture). It's not nearly as strong or sturdy as the first. The springs are weak, which makes the job so much harder. If I had read the fine print, and knew it was coming from Target, I wouldn't have chosen this one.Now I see it's on sale for $9.99 - maybe it's worth that, but not the $17.99 I paid a couple of months ago"
1,Broke within 5 minutes of using!!,"This worked great for the first 5 minutes, but then one of the plastic pins that held the hinges together broke off, making it a completely worthless piece of plastic. Complete waste of money!!"
1,Just a hot mess in more ways than one,"This is a worthless item. I bought it a couple of months ago and stopped using it within a week. Yes, it is absolutely adorable, but at the end of the day it doesn't work. When I tried to scoop up the poop it smeared into the rake area and made a mess. It was hot that first time it happened so needless to say I was quite irritated. The next times were no better. Unless the poop is dried all the way through it will not scoop it well.The larger pooper scooper that I bought off of Amazon is a PetCo that works perfectly. It is a simple scooper with no rake or snap back affect. This purple one is leaning against my fence being decorative along side the cute waste basket. I am back to using the bags in the small area that this scooper was bought to handle. The PetCo scooper is in the larger area of the yard. I won't buy another cute non-functional item again. A waste of time and money."
3,Works but not on a thick lawn,Unfortunately this contraption didn't hold up well on a lawn in my neck of the woods. For other landscaping it would probably be just fine. It's a little too aggressive.
1,"This ""Pooper Scooper"" is of poor quallity.","After first use, the product broke so that the jaws would not open or close properly. Other brands of ""Pooper Scoopers"" that we purchased from Amazon worked as promised but this one was really defective and did not function as described. Will never buy this product again."
2,Not good if you have a lot dogs..,"I have a lot of dogs..Usually at least six at one time not including puppies.. I foster dogs ongoing- I thought this might be nice, as it has a lot of good reviews- I was wrong.. Within one day of use one of the plastic screws fell out.. I was able to rig it with a replacement but what a lightweight cheap contraption.. If you just have one dog it might be ok but I prefer the butler style scoops... Much better for heavy use and scooping... Scooping ""wetter"" poop is nearly impossible with this.. A huge ole mess.. It feels really cheap as well-I would have returned it but didn't bother as threw all the packaging away .. Will keep near the back door for one pile scoops.. If you want to scoop fast though get a two piece butler scoop- A little more expensive but much more efficient!"
3,Ok Sccoper but not great in the grass.,"I purchased this to replace my old rake and shovel system that finally self destructed. I needed something that works well in the grass and this is definitely not it. This product might work well in very low cut grass or maybe gravel, etc. But in a normal yard with average grass height, this just makes a mess and also rips out the grass. I ended up returning this and Amazon fully refunded my money. If you are looking for a much better alternative for a popper scooper to use in grass, you might want to take a look at this one...Wire Rake Scooper for Grass"
1,Broke after a few uses,Had one of these pooper scoopers before and after years of use it was time to replace. I bought another one and only after a few uses the spring broke and it became misaligned. I'm not a fan of this design any more and have decided to go with the wire rake type. Not very happy with this product.
1,Lazy Pet Poop Patrol Jaw Scoop,"Just got it, I will see if it still works in a few months. It is made of plastic, my only concern. Otherwise it is as described and does the job it is supposed to do! Happy scooping!Update: IT BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT!!!"
1,Nope,"Broken after a month. Should it be this hard to make a decent poop scoop? Seriously. :) I wouldn't purchase again, nor would I recommend it."
4,"Works well, but feels flimsy",It works well but it does feel a little flimsy. I don't plan to throw it around or bang it on the concrete so I should be fine. It has trouble picking things up in tight spaces as it has a large scooper.
2,"Not Good for the ""Normal"" Lawn","It's VERY well made - sturdy. But, unless you have a very smooth lawn and keep you grass VERY low-mowed, you'll have problems with the teeth getting caught, which makes it ineffective! I understand they have one ""for grass"" (don't know what surface THIS one is for!<g>), and maybe that one is better. But in the meantime I picked up a 2 piece Large Spade Set, which works like a charm. Two Irish Wolfhounds and a Golden make for a lot of poop! :)"
4,Ok but...,"This is a very nice scooper but it does not work very well in grass. I'm sure if you had to pick up on a sidewalk it would work much better. We only seem to grab the grass, not the poop. Maybe the ""teeth"" are too small? Searching for another that will hopefully pick up in grass."
5,Good quality,"This seems to be more solid construction than other similar products.I have a small dog, so small poop, but I like this model because the length makes it easy to pick up, not so much bending over.I would recommend this and probably buy another one when it breaks."
2,good for warm temps and small to medium dogs,"This product worked great in warm temps and while my large breed puppy was less then 50lbs, but as he grew the product had more difficultly with the size of his droppings. Also once it got cold out the plastic became brittle and broke...searching for a new one now..."
1,Cheap Plastic,"This product appeared to be a great idea and still is if it were made of a better plastic. I'm embarrassed to admit that I bought 3 of these and not one latest more then 2 months. The problem is that the plastic used is of very poor quality and tends to be very brittle and snap very easy. I have called and mailed the company to complain, but they never returned my calls or E- Mails. That tells me that they do not care or stand behind there product. I will no longer support them and buy any of there products again. Beware there are other companies out there that make the same cheap product, they are no better. There all made of the same cheap plastic."
3,Watch this product,"I received my unit and it was broke out of the box. A pin that connects the jaws with the arms was missing so the unit did not work. I thought the fact that the pins are plastic was a little cheap so I put in a small bolt and nut problem fixed. The unit does a good job but could be a little longer another four inches would make it more comfortable for people 6' and taller, never the less it does the job."
3,Weak handle broke after 2 years,"The top handle (purple) is weak in the center and broke after a couple of years. I believe it broke because of two factors:1. There is an unnecessary hole in the middle for hanging.2. The handle is curved downward. When using the device it is pushed into the surrounding grass or dirt to allow the jaws to get below the waste. The downward curve of the handle concentrates the downward force into the center where the hole happens to be, causing breakage."
5,Works great even in grass,"I was worried about it not working in my grassy lawn (about 4"" high) but it works fine. It tears up a little grass but at least it picks up the mess."
5,AWESOME!,"Good quality. Works great. Nice color. Springs could stand to be a little bit tighter, but it works great anyways!"
4,Just as described,"The Lazy Pet Poop Patrol Jaw Scoop is a nice size. The arm is long enough to give you a good distance between the poop and your hand. It is not industrial strength, but can handle most of the stinky jobs."
4,Solid Little Pooper-Scooper,"This scooper isn't as sturdy as some on the market, but it seems well-built and I think it will last for a while. I do wish it was a little longer - it requires a lot of leaning over to use."
3,Warning!,"While this product markets itself for the ""lazy"" pet owner, it does require work! As someone who doesn't want to bother with the tiring efforts of walking, petting, and feeding a dog, I thought this product would at least relieve me of one bothersome task - waiting for my dog to squat and plop. Maybe it's just my dog, but no amount of coaxing will get him to use this thing. I've tried leaving it by the front door. I've tried putting a doggie biscuit in the jaw scoop and laying the scoop next to his favorite tree. I've even tried using the product myself - you try explaining to the cops why you felt the need to leave a Lincoln log in your own driveway. When I told them that I was trying to show my dog how to use the scoop they looked at me like I was an idiot."
3,jonah hex,"The movie arrived on time as promised in great condition...after I got it, I remembered that I had seen it before an wasn't really impressed. But, having it as an addition to my library, I don't mind buying it, Story line was kinda long an sketchy, but overall the best I can say is it was ""alright'"
3,Jonah Hex,"It's a okay movie. There's some decent action sequences, but honestly, this is more of a rental movie than a keeper. I'm only vaguely familiar with Jonah Hex as a graphic novel character, so I can't compare this movie to comic book canon. However, on it's own, the movie is not the greatest, and really worth just watching once."
2,Lame,"I am a fan of western movies and also superhero movies. I thought Jonah Hex would fit the bill. Sadly it did not. It was an awfully boring movie. Did not hold my attention at all. There were no spectacular gun fights, it was all 'bang, your dead', and that was it. Not to mention Hex's butt was always beaten by the bad guys. Made you wonder why they even made a movie about Jonah Hex. The leading lady can't act and the story was a real sleeper. If you need help sleeping this movie will do that."
4,"Come on, it was fun...","I'm seeing all these negative reviews, and I just had to put in my two cents. Yeah, I would have liked for them to stay more true to the source material, but it was fun. When you watch this movie, remember it is based on a comic book. It is not Hamlet or Macbeth, but it's fun and very fast paced. Megan Fox is totally hot, spending most of the movie running around in her underwear. Josh Brolin did a good job playing Hex, which wasn't that different from his character in the 90's tv show ""Young Riders."" I thought the over-the-top weapons were great. They reminded me of ""Evil Dead"" and ""Army of Darkness."" The movie was a little cheezy, but if you like action and westerns you'll like this movie. If it hadn't been pushed as a serious movie, I believe it could have reached a B-movie cult status."
3,I just like the movie.,"I can't always put my finger on why I like some movies, and that's ok. Every movie doesn't have to be analyzed. I just liked this movie, and watch it from time to time. Recommend it."
3,It put a spell on me,"Have seen worse westerns with a twist...not sorry I watched/rented it, but don't think it will end up in my library. Overall 3 stars, mostly for the cast as Mr. Hex seemed to be a perfect fit for the role."
1,What's the HEX?,"- The special effects were terrible. In many scenes, I could see they were obviously fake. For examples, the scene where Jonah was shooting 2 machine guns straddled on both sides of his horse. Yeah right!- The plot was thin. The acting was non-emotional even when it was showing a teen being abused by the leader of the bad guys.- Even Megan Fox could not save this movie. It's another nail in the coffin of Western genre. No wonder, the majority of movie-goers do not pay to watch Western films any more."
5,Awesome movie,i have heard of jonah hex but i really didn't know anything about him until i saw this movie and looked up the character on wikipiea.com. this is a pretty cool character i'm very glad that dc is finally coming out with other superhero movies outside of batman and superman. garantee i love batman and superman but we need to see other heroes. i'm so excited to see the green lantern and the green hornet movie coming out next year. this was an awesome movie. keep up the good job dc.
1,"as if the movie itself wasn't terribly lackluster, the 12 min of trailers was horrific","About the most redeeming quality of this movie is Megan Fox, she's very cute, but the rest of it is pretty hard to work through. A relatively poorly developed plot line, and from what I've read in other reviews, doesn't matchup to the original story lines much at all (I personally had never heard of Jonah Hex before the movie).But what I found incredibly frustrating and ultimately annoying was that there was over 12 minutes of trailers and advertisements for other DC Comic related stuff that the DVD would not let fast forward or menu out of. Completely unacceptable. If I thought I could pin point which part of the responsible parties were responsible for that, I'd be sure to never buy any of there products in the future."
1,Jonah Hex: What happened?,"Why, oh why, did this film suck? It had so much potential when brought up at last year's Comic-Con, but like 2005's 'Constantine' before it, the cool premise went ker-plunk. I had an interest in JH when I first read a couple of '90s comic mini-series, which is where the supernatural parts got slipped in. They were great. This, on the other hand, should have been on cable or straight-to-video. Yeesh! Hold your nose and rent it once and wait for 'Cowboys And Aliens' in 2011 to hopefully get the stink out. (And Constantine should have been a Brit. Sorry Keanu.)"
1,,Just wanted to vote the one star to bring the rating down. This movie betrays the titular character. That's all.
2,A little disappointing,"Story has a lot of potential, but most of the best parts were shown in the trailer. Was very dark...hard to see the action"
3,So-So Shoot'Em-Up Action-Western.,"This shoot-'em-up action-western has a good plot, but could have used more character devlopment, especially with Jonah's family and his relationship with Lilah. Josh Brolin and Megan Fox are quite good, and Malkovich is his usual villainous self, though better in ""Dangerous Liasions"" and ""In The Line Of Fire."" (Why is it he can't do an accent?) Passable film. Stick with ""Law Abiding Citizen."" Rated PG-13."
4,I really liked it,"I saw this film at the movies and really liked it and was surprised when it got such bad reviews. I found it an adventure with great special effects and almost constant mayhem. This movie was off-beat and unusual and had things in it I had not seen before in other films. And I like it when things blow up and this had a lot of that type of violence. Jonah is a real bad guy to be such a good guy and I enjoyed watching the charter development. This film will clearly not win any awards and it is not for younger kids, but if you like roaring, violent, action packed adventure adding this to your film collection would be a good idea."
4,I liked it,"simply put Jonah Hex is a revenge movie. There are scenes that are a little too much, but add to the character. Its entertaining. Its got bullets and explosions, what else can you ask for."
5,I thought it was really good.,"I've never read the comix, and can only judge the movie on it's own. Ignoring all the fashionable ""Megan Fox is So hot... but won't do me"" or ""Can't act"" hate going on... she's no better or worse then a million Hollywood chicks... The movie is actually a fun ride. Sure they don't explain Jonah's powers much, but that's much cooler then some techno-babel answer or something silly like midi-chlorians in the recent Star Wars films. Jonah Hex is an interesting character and I'd like to see more of him."
2,Wait a minute people....,"First off, this movie was filmed twice. The original director turned his cut in and then the studio hired another guy (uncredited) to reshoot almost the entire movie. He added the stupid talk to the dead stuff and the super weapon garbage. If you read the original script, the one where Thomas Jane all but begged to star in, it is a hard ""R"" violent, vengeance driven western. I have long been a Jonah Hex fan and when I heard about them making this movie, I put in my ""JOSEY WALES"" dvd and got out my 1970-1972 comic books and hoped for the best. Although I was disappointed, it was still fun to watch."
2,bad,"I did not care for this movie. It seems more often then not you see the whole movie in the trailer, thats about what happened here. I like both of these actorsnot sure what happened"
3,good but not great,overall the movie was entertaining but lacked a solid storyline for a sequel. Megan Fox's character was very to stand
3,Great for a sunday afternoon at home,"There is nothing new in this movie. It is just another film about graphic novels heroes. However, really enjoyable, if you don't make great expectations."
3,It's okay,Loved the comic so I thought I'd check it out. It's worth watching once but it's mediocre. Feels like a remake of Wild Wild West.
1,Not a western...,This movie was not what I expected. If you are looking to enjoy a good western this is not the movie! This was more of a matrix movie.
4,Enjoyable,Rented and watched. I thought it was well done and enjoyed it very much. Should get a higher rating
5,Good Movie !!!,"This movie arrived super fast. This movie was underrated due to the animosity felt towards Megan Fox, this movie still has the ability to be a franchise, but probably without Megan Fox, but Josh Brolin is an awesome actor and should be given this franchise (watch this movie for yourself)."
1,All you need to know ...,"The story is cliche and atrocious. You can barely make out what Brolin is saying 95% of the time. Malkovich is good and Aiden Quinn is sorely underused. Fassbender does OK as Malkovich's lackey. Mostly, this is just a mess."
2,So much wasted potential,"As a comic book fan, this story line had so much potential - wasted on an indifferent cast and endless, redundant and boring fight scenes. The allusion to and demonstrations of Hex's supernatural powers are few and far between, they really become beside the point instead of an interesting focus. Instead of building on the sci-fi action, the director chose lengthy gratuitous violence that added nothing to the plot. One became numb to it after the first few scenes. Hex's dry humor gets lost in this maze of a poor and rambling story line, tedious fighting, and Megan Fox (as a bored as a prostitute) forgets to move her face while speaking her lines. The film itself deserves one star only, I gave the special effects (which there should have been much more of) another star. This film could have been so good, the fact that it is so bad indicates a level of incompetence that is just stunning and not just a little bit sad."
2,Jonah Hex,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have viewed in a long time. The acting was so poor I can see why it bombed at the theater. Even Megan Fox could not help this movie. She, by the way, is not a A, B or even a C actress. Her best stuff was in the Transformer movies where action was better than dialog. I was disappointed in my purchase but there was some enterntaining qualities I think John Malkovich is an underappreciated actor. Josh Brolin is an ok actor but the action sequences lack realism."
2,Jonah Hex - What did they do to you !!!,"In the early 70s, having read my share of Kid Colt and the Rawhide Kid, Jonah Hex featuring in Weird Western Tales for the first time was an amazing character ! The screenplay for the Comics showed some really caustic but witty back and forth between Jonah and the numerous devious devils he slayed. His dog getting shot and dyeing after freeing him from the Confeds local army still rings an emotional chord when i reminesce. Regrettably, Jonah Hex the movie has not been able to capture any of such moments and has remained a poor revenge story with the character Jonah not being threshed out at all. I still love the Comic Character and wish could say the same for the movie...alas"
2,Stupid movie,"I feel dumber for having watched this horrible flick. From the minute it started until the very end, nothing was captivating at all. So many cliche moments I felt queazy from them.. Seriously...if you like things you see in every movie stuffed into another movie and then compressed into one big cliche, this is for you. For anyone who hates cliches, stay away...stay far away."
1,Give it a pass,"First Megan appears on Jennifer's body as demon possessed, now she plays a woman who trades her body for money in Jonah Hex. Just for your own thinking. I had expectations not high, but I still had them, that the movie would be fine to watch, but it was plain boring with ugly Jonah Hex and a lot of evil, damnation, few weapons which of course are very sci-fi,and a short plot. Jonah plays a dark hero who looks for vengeance and revenge. Stupid, not worth watching, waste of time."
2,Not Impressed,"I thought this would be a great movie from the previews, but once again all the good parts were the previews. I bought this movie instead of renting it first. Waste of $15! Megan is a hottie but she dont even show skin. Plus the movie is pretty short with a punch line my 4 yr old figured out."
5,jonah hex,"Extremely good cowboy fare.The comic book characters that are made into live movie characters,are getting better and better.Great work Marvel Comics."
4,Loved it!,"Hey, I don't know what the critics are looking for, but I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. The action was great, the special effects outstanding, and Brolin's portrayal was spot on! Malkovich was his usual outstanding self. It was like watching an early spaghetti western, but with better special effects and totally updated. It's one of those movies I'll pop on in a flash when I want to kick back and be entertained. Once again, the reviewers are looking for some other ethereal BS, instead of just ""was it entertaining?"". Forget ""real"" .... it's called ""FUN""!"
4,Jonah Hex,"I'll have to admit that I really enjoyed the movie. It's not something that will appeal to everyone but it is a fun movie to watch. The only real complaint I have is that it was too short. I mean 70 minutes? Come on! That is terrible! It didn't really have time to develop the characters the way they should have been. The movie needed at least another 30 minutes. Other than that the movie was fine to me. Yeah, some of the guns were a little out there (like the gatling guns on the saddle and the dual cross bows that shot dynamite) but that is not enough to say the movie is horrible like some reviews I've read. It doesn't go with the comic at all and I kinda hated that at first but after a while I got over it. I watch movies to be entertained and this movie was entertaining to me."
3,"Bad Blu-ray, good movie ...","I don't understand WHY with all the tecnology we have, some news movies still have an unsatisfatory video quality. This is one example. Either in the good shots there are problems. The face of Megan Fox, for example, is completely washed. I look at the fantastic restauration of ""2001, A Space Odissey"", a 40 years old movie, and I think that the modern filmakers have serious visuals problems. Go to a doctor! Unless you want to kill Blu-ray!"
3,"Okay, not great.",For a live action rendition of a comic book this was okay. Unfortunately the premise doesn't lend itself much room for growth beyond a single movie.
1,They tell Jonah Hex's origin in animation,"Origins are important. Imagine if a Batman movie told the origin story in a quick animated sequence. Bruce and his parents leave ""The Mark of Zorro,"" they go down an alley, a gunman demands Bruce's mother's pearls and Bruce's father defends her. Shots are fired, the parents die, Bruce lives and Batman is born. In ""Jonah Hex,"" they do the complicated origin in a quick, badly animated sequence that really says nothing. You shouldn't be surprised that the rest of the movie sucks."
1,"Finally, a movie worse than the transformers","Don't waste your time. Even at the $1 special, it was a waste and I turned it off before it ended. Theres an hour of my life i'll never get back."
1,I Have Never Seen Such Bad Acting!,"A disappointing film that ruins the meaning of a film adaptation! While Josh Brolin is normally a great actor, he could not provide convincing acting when he played Jonah Hex. Also, this film has poor makeup because Jonah Hex's scars are supposed to be more extensive while in this film, they toned down the scarring too much. They could have at least used CGI to extend the scarring instead of trying to mess it up with old-fashioned makeup. Another issue that came up in this film is the fact that Megan Fox and John Malkovich use the same acting style they use in all of their movies instead of altering their acting so that they seem more convincing and they would not look like emotionless robots trying to preach their lines. In conclusion, this film is a complete disappointment to audiences everywhere.The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell"
4,"Not For ""Da Bird"" Cat Toy","I bought this because I stupidly thought that since this toy is called ""Da Fur"" that it would be associated with the ""Da Bird"" toy that my cat loves. The problem is, it's not and there's nothing on the toy that clips on to the ""Da Bird"" pole in order for it to work with that toy.My cat still likes this toy, throws it in the air and really has a good time with it but don't buy this if you want to use it with your Da Bird cat toy."
4,Cat loves this thing!,"I got this for my cat and he is OBSESSED (and that's putting it lightly!)with this toy. he loves it, and chases it all around our home dribbling it.The only reason I wouldn't give this a bajillion star rating is that its not very durable. My lovely white carpet is sprinkled with bright purple feathers from myc at literally ripping apart this toy. Upon further inspection I realized that the back of this toy is basically super glued shut with feathers stuck in it. I don't know how much longer it'll live, but for 5 bucks, I'm not too particular."
3,Not So Hot,"My cats love the da'mouse and the da'bird cat toys. I expected this to be a hit as well as one of my cats loves to bite toys and scratch with his back paws. For some reason, even with the catnip, this toy flopped. I do have picky cats when it comes to toys. One doesn't like much of anything, and the other seems to prefer specific textures. It was worth a try, though."
2,Breaks apart very easily,The cats love this but it has already fallen apart without being usable anymore after only a couple of days with normal play.
3,Not sturdy enough,The cats loved it but they chewed it up in less than an hour. Maybe they could insert a leather liner for strength.
3,"Looked good, but cats didn't go for it","I thought it looked like a fun toy, and I have one cat that loves those fake mice filled with catnip with feathers on the end. My other cat loves Da Bird, so I figured this would be a knock out of the park. Unfortunately, neither cat went for it, even though they love feathers. It looked like it was well made, and every cat is different, so I wouldn't say it's bad, it's just not for my critters."
3,"Cat likes it, but...","The cat enjoys this toy, however, it wasn't what I expected, silly me. Thought it was an attachment for ""DaBird"", but it isn't. Oh well, live and learn. The cat still thinks I'm a hero 'cause he got something new to play with."
5,Da Fur Thing,"The cats love it. Only thing I would suggest, is somehow attach the feathers in a more secure manner. A few minutes of play and they are detached."
5,A good Place with Yoga by Connie Fedel,"This is my second CD by Connie Fedel. I personally am honered to have Connie as my Yoga instructor 4 times a week. In the 2 years of her teachings I have learned wonderful things about my self. Yoga is not a Competition its a Practice and this is what you will learn from her wonderful CD. Breathing, mind, and movement with Connie who see's each person as an individual. For those who are interested in Yoga I suggest this CD.Thank You ConnieDarlene Bowman"
3,Rather weak,"For the size and weight of these closet air fresheners, the scent is surprisingly weak and almost undetectable. At first I used only one for a standard wall closet (not walk-in) but could not tell that there was an air freshener at work. Only when I opened the second one and place it in there, was I finally able to smell a bit of a difference. The cedar scent in itself could be a bit more pleasant as well.Overall I don't hate it but I also do not love it. Not sure that I would buy this again."
3,it's okay but not powerful,Purchased for use in my van. It smells good and pleasing but is rather weak. If it put out more umph I'd have given it 5 stars. I decided against returning but I recommend not buying one.
2,No smell after a week,"I'm totally disappointed in this purchase. It was really strong smelling at first which is what I wanted and then boom, one week later, nothing. The closet was back to being funky. Total waste of money. I'm going to see what glade product I can stick in my closet - see if that works better."
2,Not really that accurate,Purchase this a couple weeks ago. Was somewhat disappointed because it is not nearly as accurate as I was hoping. I measured out a new 50/50 Prestone coolant mixture and this tester said It was more like 60(coolant)/40water. If this cannot accurately read brand new coolant from the same brand I cannot recommend it.
4,Classic,"A real classic, and great for everyone who loves Beavis and Butthead. The downside is the lack of music videos, but that's pretty hard to license for these types of releases."
5,Beavis and Butthead Volume 4,"This DVD contains all of the episodes that were recently featured on MTV. Each episode includes 2 different ""stories."" As is tradition with Beavis and Butthead, each half-hour episode has 2 separate ""stories."" Instead of Beavis and Butthead reviewing Music Videos, they now review and comment on reality tv shows including Jersey Shore and 16 and Pregnant. There are some Music Videos, but their reviews now include Music Videos and clips of reality TV's funnies moments. The episodes are great and are a classic, yet modern twist on Beavis and Butthead in the present! Awesome DVD"
4,All the new episodes are on this set!,"The whole new season of Beavis and Butthead are here!""Werewolves of Highland""/""Crying""""Daughter's Hand""/""Tech Support""""Holy Cornholio""/""Drones""""Supersize Me""/""Bathroom Break""""The Rat""/""Spill""""Doomsday""/""Dumb Design""""Copy Machine""/""Holding""""Used Car""/""Bounty Hunter""""Time Machine""/""Massage""""School Test""/""Snitches""""Whorehouse""/""Going Down""Update Review: The only thing I find annoying is that they make fun of ""Jersey Shore"" (I hate that show with a passion and I am Italian-American myself, not a fake guido) in every episode which I find very annoying, and I miss the metal music videos of the old seasons and don't like how they play mostly today's crappy music videos, but the episodes are epic!"
4,Good As Ever,"I rented Volume 4 of Beavis and Butt-Head from the public library; then a few weeks later, bought it at Best Buy for less than fifteen bucks, since it was being advertised by the retailer as a ""four dollars off"" promotion through Cinco De Mayo. The best episodes are ""Doomsday"", ""Time Machine"", ""Used Car"", ""Supersize Me"" (though I wish Mike Judge had used a more creative title for that episode, such as ""Biggie Size Me""), and the season finale, ""Going Down"". I agree with the reviewer who said that there should have been an option made for viewers to see the cartoons without the videos and reality show clips. The San Diego Comic-Con forum extra was informative; I wish there had been more bonus features added, such as audio commentaries."
5,Great,"Modern B&B is awesome. They make fun of Jersey Shores, along with music videos too. Snookie is even more of a slut with Butthead giving perspective on her true nature as a dtf guido. Modern B&B is a little more mature and is funnier then ever. Watch it!"
3,worth it??,"I'm going 3 stars. I love these 2 idiots. But MTV is pulling a Nickelodeon. Taking HD video and making it FS! WTF. More then likely no extras just the 11, 20min eps. about $1.25 per ep?? I'd rather get iTunes HD for that price.. I dont even think iTunes released the show. I'd have to buy this used at half the price. Even if there is SOME bonus features.. I doubt it'll be that mind blowingI hope there will be another season, but this.. MTV failed at a dvd release that could have been pwnage to me. That is MY 2 cents... for the moment"
3,Daytona,"This isn't a review as such... i just want to change the Artists name to: ""Daytona"" ...the title is: ""My Obsession With Elizabeth Montgomery""... unfortunately with amazon you can only edit the label and title, but not the artist???"
2,This is a Power2000 battery,This is a Power2000 battery (NP-400) not a Konica Minolta battery. I've had these batteries before and have not liked them. They don't hold a charge like the Minolta battery or last as long. They are inexpensive so if you want to save money they will work but the tradeoff is a shorter life.
1,stops recharging after a while,"Lasted for a few years / charge cycles, then wouldn't hold a charge. Unlike the factory battery for my D20, which is still working."
3,Not too impressed,"This book attempts to cover too much material instead of spending more time on specific topics. If you're interested in performance, replication, backup or recovery, skip this book and get the High Performance MySQL book. You'll quickly see the material on those topics has a lot more depth in the other book. Especially for replication, backup and recovery.For everything else, you might as well just get a introductory/reference mysql book.Also, the coverage of mysql 5 is based upon an early beta."
3,Informative,"The subject of the ecology of New the England and how it was affected by the Puritans and their like is very interesting, because it is something not normally thought about or written about. Informative book, but somewhat ""dry"" reading at times and also the information sometimes seems to not ""flow"" well on occasion. Still, I have never read another book quite like it, so it is also the best book I have ever read on the subject."
4,As advertised,"Great flag as advertised. I assumed it would be 2 sided, but it's not, hence the 4 stars, but quality is great."
2,"eh, not so good","Well my friend Jenn and I were reading this book and we went to Ohio shortly afterwards. It turns out, the author is wrong about several key things:- the tallest tree in Marietta is 45 feet tall, not 44 (I measured it myself)- there is no statue of John Quincy Adams in Hamilton's town square.- According to my own count, fords are much more popular than Buicks in Ohio. This is surprising, in light of the Buick factory outside Jamestown, but true.Beside these factual errors, this book gave Jenn and me many helpful insights into the flora and the fauna of this remarkable state in our nation."
5,Please Spanish veersion,This book is absolutely excelent!!! I have it in paperback in Spanish. I would love to have ir also in Spanish for Kindle
4,A good learning start,"Looking at this book from a novice point of view the house interpertations where very informative and will be very usefull for chart info. Quite liked the case study section put all into perspective,a great learning curve."
4,"A very good ""cookbook""","Dispite thefact that this is an astrological ""cookbook"" - Pluto in the fifth means bla bla, it is still very insightful. The author also always reminds the reader of which other factors one should consider for most individual house positions."
3,Fast Service/Good Product hard to find,"11-Inch Wood Matches by Outset, 60 Ct.Hard to find product. Fast delivery from Amazon"
2,Poor quality for the price.,"Considering the price, I expected this to be a good addition to my array of percussion instruments. I had hoped to be able to use this as a practice pad. The main problem with this is the ring that it gives off. It's really distracting from the snare sound that it should have. After putting tape on the bottom of it, the ring was greatly dampened, but now it's more difficult to play on, as it has less bounce now. One pro to this is that it has a head that is similar to a real snare drum, unlike most practice pads, but nonetheless, this is not recommended unless its just for use as a toy."
1,incomplete order no stick or brush,The order was incomplete no stick or brush would not recommend. No stars i will see if they send other items
4,Lovely~,"Very chic, lovely, and comfortable! The size is accurate. There could be one more notch on the ankle strap, but still great!"
1,The worst voice of greek pop music.....,"Don't ever think to go and buy this cd, you will be dissappointed. I'm from Cyprus, a greek island but with different government, so I have heard Despina Vandi live; 70% of people have better voice than her. The composer of her cd is very famous for writing songs that make huge success but after half a year nobody remembers them. If you would like to listen to something good and absolutely greek buy Anna's Vissi cds. She has the voice of Celine Dion, she dances like Madonna and she's beautifull like Mariah Carrey. She's the most well-known atist-singer of Greece. She has started an international career with her english-language album 'Everything I am'. Many people admit that Despina Vandi is jealous of Vissi and mimitates her at the voice dressing, songs. There have been many crash tests in maqazines and newspapers proclaimed Anna (Vissi) the winner."
2,Fairly Good But Still a Copy,"Despina Vandi is back , but this time with a whole bunch of songs not so unique. Her voice still sounds like Anna Vissi and the fact that she uses similar songs puts her in the 2nd place. Of course she has talent but this cd was not what i expected from her. Too bad..."
4,Second to NONE!,"Despina second to Anna Vissi?? You must be kidding. Anna has a good voice, but I sometimes think she forgets her Greek roots and has sold out to commercialize her music for more $$$. Despina is a much better singer with a much stronger and in-depth voice and while she sings some in English, she is definitely true to her Greek roots."
1,She was not like the magazine story,"There was so much profanity in her book I sent it back with a complaint. Was a big disappointment as she had a story in a magazine that was so lovely. Why anyone stoops to profanity and vulgar language when they can very well write without it, I will never know.Sorry, but this is my own opinion"
2,the GOOD and the BAD,"dont think that it is a 40 dollar plus gift basket. honestly, it is ok but worth like $20 tops.just not big enough, should be double the size!"
2,There is a reason why it's discontiued...,"""COLD LAKE"" is the whipping boy of the Celtic Frost catalog and for good reason, it effectivly ended this band's career. This was preceived as a ""sellout"" record and it damaged the fanbase, after ground breaking releases like TO MEGA THERION and INTO THE PANDIMONIUM, which sounded like a completely different band. It's not all THAT bad, ""Cherry Orchids"" was a solid song, and it's alot better then much of the Def Leppards, Motley Crues, Poisons and Wingers they were trying to emulate with this one. However, this is the point of downfall for the band, even latter albums were not the same after this one. Ever notice how all of the Celtic Frost CDs were re-issued except this one? Yeah, i don't even think Tom approves of this, it was never meant to be put out as a Frost album but the damn record company made them keep the name for it for commercial reasons. Sad."
3,celtic frost's most misunderstood album,"when i first heard this back in 1988/89 i thought wtf??? this is nothing like ""morbid tales"" or to megatherion"" this is almost like motley crue (theatre of pain era) it took time to grow on me it was definately a far cry from their hellhammer days and such.i think tom g warrior was going thru a burnout period of being bored with the satanic imagary of some of the celtic frost trademark,most fans probably felt betrayed by this album i just wish that he wouldve kept it together and not wait till the mid 2000's to release ""monotheist"""
1,What the HELL Happen!!!,"What can I say about this album but they eithier sold out or thought this was a good change. What ever they were thinking it failed. They went from the Darkness to the Light! Not even good light bad lighting. Not to mention they trying to look like Slaughter or Posion. What the hell is that about. I do not understand when you had greatness like To Megatherion or Morbid Tales then a Frozen Terd. I give it this much it made me laugh like Hell. Song titles like juices like wine and Cherry Orchards where to funny. It was pretty bad when they tried combine some old style with this POP. I would pass on this one and just go back to what they do best and thats being Celtic Frost of old , You know Procreation of the Wicked and not Cold Lake! We can only hope. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to these other fools who rave about this one. And buy the old stuff!"
1,Wrong Item,"Note, ordered this and received yesterday. But, Queen Bee has wrong image!!!! Be careful. Currently, image is of BAIN DE FORCE (which is what I wanted) but that is not what will be sent. This is deceptive and not the item depicted. Hopefully Queen Bee will correct their mistake. I will report back on how this is resolved."
3,"Satisfactory Product, but NOTHING more","The product works, fills in semi-large gaps, but adhesive is only marginally effective, even after careful prep. of area -- cleaning & drying. Also, it is a bit lightweight to be used for doors that are frequently opened and closed. I used a staple gun to attach by putting staples in the center trough. So far it has held up through several (8-10) freeze thaw cycles and including two 24 hr temperature changes of -4 to +22 C (25 to 72) or better. No better than 3 stars, but no worse either."
2,Low grade adhesive...,"The weatherstrip is well made and easy to install, but even after properly cleaning all of the surfaces, the adhesive that was on the strip is of poor quality and started ""detaching"" from the door frame.I solved that by applying some automotive trim adhesive, but, I should not have had to. But, with my ""fix"" the weatherstrip has performed well and sealed out the cold, which has been extreme over the last couple of months."
4,"Buy it, Buy it, Buy it!!!",This is simply inspiriational! When you have a bad day at work or things aren't going right escape into these letters. They'll melt your heart!
4,Love letters,"A collection of love letters from couples, that that wrote to each other from when they first started dating until now. My favorite were the letters that were from the older couples."
5,Awsome,My Baby loved it! She is in Alaska and I am in Utah so when she recived this book I really earned points!
3,This book is just a pictorial history,"If you're looking for an interesting summary of their trucks in a simplistic pictorial chronological presentation and want almost zero mechanical reference, this book is for you. Don't buy this book for repair or restoration tips, it's not that kind of book. Interesting enough as a look at the evolution of these tough practical trucks, but very basic year by year model examples only, along with the company's history."
2,Uninteresting,"This is truly a masterpiece!...nah..not really.Yet Trypes did have fun trying . Greek rock is a sad story , no doubt about that and the fact that Kefali Gemato Hrisafi is considerred to be one of the best greek rock records says it all i think . This is rude , aggressive clumsy rock with much adrenaline but not any depth in it . The vocals are awfull , the lyrics simply bad."
5,Best VFM for Surround setup,"I have owned these speakers for a little over a year now. The sound these speakers produce is surprisngly warm and lifelike from what is a relatively small speaker. This is no doubt to the fantastic build quality of these speakers. From the piano lacquer case to the stylish silver front these are beautiful speakers in my opinion. They are very heavy for their size and extremely sturdy. One of the binding posts broke on mine (caused by me, not a design flaw), and Athena technologies shipped me out a complete new binding post and hardware, no questions asked. Excellent customer service. You can not beat these speakers at this price."
5,Early Motown Stereo,"This LP/CD ""The One Who Really Loves You"" Mary Wells was a treasured find. This Motown 605, released in September 1962, was Mary Wells' second album. I've found that nine of the ten songs are in Stereo! One song may be ""electronically enhanced."" However, a song like ""Drifting Love"" from '61 was amazing to hear in stereo!We've found the original LP way back in 1970, from a neighborhood friend. To my recollection, Mike McLean, a Motown engineering genuis, he ""randomly"" back in 1966 ""re-mix"" several early Motown LPs. I don't have a list of Mr. McLean's projects. During the 80s, when Motown released (for the last time) several early albums, many appear in Stereo. To list a couple were Brenda Holloway's Every Little Bit Hurts, Stevie Wonder's Sings Ray Charles, Martha & the Vandellas' Come and Get These Memories"". I have been lookinng for the albums ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"" and ""Playboy"" in true stereo. Hopefully, I will find it on Amazon!"
3,Okay but...,This is a nice tasting coca mix but I was disappointed that it has hydrogenated oils and corn syrup solids. I don't plan on buying this again. I will go back to making it myself the way my mom use to make it. I really wish Amazon would make sure that their products have a complete ingredients list. This should be mandatory!
5,Inspiring!,"Everyone is certainly entitled to their opinion, but after reading Rosa's seriously negative review, I felt compelled to jump to this book's defence. I read it in junior high and LOVED it! I could relate to Jasmin in most aspects (as I believe many young adults could) and felt a kindred kinship with her. Anyone with imagination, creativeness and a sense of adventure will enjoy this book. I was thrilled when I found it in a second hand book store (like an old friend) and I will give it to my daughter when she is old enough to read it."
5,jazzy!,"Vassilis Lekkas is famous in Greece, worked with Hatzidakis, Theodorakis, Mikroutzikos and much more. But he always was openminded, and this album, his latest, is in a way a kind of jazz-greek-folk. Very special and very up to date! If greek music lovers are looking for something different, not the mainstreem you can get everywhere, they will be satisfied with this pearl!!"
4,Funny stories and great illustrations!,"Any Sci-Fi fan who knows anything about comics will just love this collection. Ellison and Gaiman get you thinking while newcomers Mike Pascale and Sid Gevurah had me laughing. Comics fans will love the artwork by Dave Cockrum, Bill Messner-Loebs, Gray Morrow and others. Most of the stories have a jewish subtext, but none ever get preachy. Gevurah's ""Last of the Moe Greenbaums"" is a standout that still has me chuckling. Clifford Lawrence Meth's ""I, Gezheh"" is a classic allegory. All in all, a great read"
3,Worth buying for the price,This product is effective for the price. I've used it on a few long trips and liked it. It does tend to pick up some static from time to time but it's much less expensive than all of other IPOD add ons.
2,Waiting for next Album,"Unfortunately I do not share fellow reviewers high praise of this album. In fact I was sadly disappointed. I'll start with Daniel Lanois. I have great respect for Lanois and I recognize that he has done great things and produced some very fine lps over the years however I feel he has drastically overproduced this album to the point that it sounds like a movie soundtrack; mostly faceless uninspired music. The songs all sound rather similiar and there is no distinctive soloing that showcases any of the band members talents and this perhaps is the worse part because I know that Brian Blade is an extremely talanted young musician. Unfortunately that is all lost in Lanois' production. Nothing unique or standout here and definitely not one of the best of 98, perhaps the next album will do Blade better justice."
3,Why isn't yaoi more masculine?,"Two men together can be very hot. While I really liked the majority of the stories in this collection and found the art to be fine, I was disappointed in just how overwhelmingly feminine the ""bottom"" or ""submissive"" as shown in each story. I've only been reading yaoi for a few years now but I must say that if all yaoi is like this, then I am disappointed. I also find a great deal of double standards when it comes to the portrayal of sexual organs and sex in yaoi -- if I had not been told that yaoi was two males, I'd swear that it often looks just like a flat chested girl and a guy. All this said, if you like the entire feminine = bottom thing, you may like this collection more than I did."
3,good but not great,"The real draw of this manga for me was the art. I was definately pleased with it and find the effeminate men to be utterly droolworthy! The fantastical elements made the stories really interesting and unqiue and not just another mindless sex fest (though those can be good too!). If you're looking for really hardcore yaoi I would say skip this, but if you're open to new and intersting stuff definately check it out, if only for the beautiful illustrations."
3,Not really Yaoi except one story,"I was disappointed with this book. THe stories were nice, but I was expecting the yaoi part since it is labeled as yaoi. The ALone in My King's Harem chapter was a tear jerker."
1,Stay away!!!,"I bought this Manga expecting Yaoi, I was VERY disappointed. The Seme look male. The Uke are all dressed like girls, all of them look like eight year old girls with their clothes off and there is no actual evidence saying they ARE boys in some stories. No gentials nothing. It seems to stress even more their girls. There is no action. No plot. Nothing. The stories are dull and boring and DMP made a huge mistake ever picking this title up! As soon as I got home, I flipped through it and shoved it on eBay straight away. It's a horrible title for any Yaoi Fan, as I am. This IS NOT YAOI! Don't make the mistake I did and waste $12, you can buy something 100 times better like something from BeBeautiful."
2,Skip this!,"It is annoying that DMP keeps classifying everything with a hint of boy's love as Yaoi. This book is of course not Yaoi. The stories cannot even be classifed as Shounen-ai as the ukes merely resemble flat chested females. Some of the stories are sweet, if you like a dose of sticky sweetness, but the drawings of the ukes simply put me off."
5,Great Chet it's good,"Granted this may not be considered a jazz staple, but I can't seem to stop listening. It's jazz for the summer, or winter, or anytime other than a rainy day.Continually upbeat, surprisingly inventive for this victim of fashion, it's strong from start to finish. Picture of Health is also special for the sheer fact that, while a great listen, it does not require attention.So, give Chet a chance, you'll like it."
5,The Best Book on Machine Trapunto,"This is the very best book on Machine Trapunto. I am thrilled with the items I have made using her guidance. If you like the look you get from Trapunto, you will be very pleased with the results you get using the machine method."
5,MUST HAVE FOR ALL TEENS,"I purchased this item for my teenage daughter about 3 years ago. She enjoyed it so much, that I ordered more to give out to other teens that she associates with. I gave them out as Christmas presents and Birthday presents. The girls that I have given them to so far are really enjoying them. They said that it has made it a little easy to pray, especially when you don't what to pray or if you find it difficult to pray."
4,Prayers That Avail Much for teens,"Great gift for teens who are learning to pray for their school, friends, family etc."
2,Jargony,"Disappointing. Bought this book hoping for a multi-facted picture of Bulgarian/Turkish relations and instead got a very jargony tome -- yet another to ride on the coat tails of Professor Said's ""Orientalism."" As Neuberger does state, Bulgaria is a complex case, but she then goes on to depict Bulgarian Turks/Pomaks/Muslims as the oppressed -- very rarely (only once -- and very briefly) making refernce to the shockingly recent centuries of Turkish rule and how that might affect the interplay of ""native"" vs ""foreigner"", muslim vs christian, monied vs dependant, a historical quagmire that is omnipresent in Bulgaria today. Bulgaria is a fascinating case study -- one that, sadly, Professor's Neuberger's book reduced to a simplistic, jargony thesis"
2,Simplistic,I read this book two years ago hoping that it will give me an insight and an interesting frame of reference for my thesis. I was disappointed. The only aspect I found useful was the information on the different policies of assimilation of the Turkish minority during Communism.
3,OK as far as it goes,"Compared with other books on the subject of adrenal fatigue, this one is short on background and theory and dry in its presentation. The subtitle tells us that it's a ""Desk Reference,"" so I guess the point is to accept it for what it is. The best part, for me at least, is the second half, with a succinct summary of a large range of remedies, a description of what they do, and recommended dosages.However, the truth is, I was disappointed. I expected more. Adrenal fatigue is largely unrecognized by the medical profession, so your family doctor is unlikely to be supportive of a treatment program. For this reason, I'm looking for good resources backed up by available science. Moreover, treatment is subtle and requires committed long-term changes in lifestyle, so I want books on the subject that are persuasive. I'm looking for a wake-up call that will convince me to commit to the program. This book fails to persuade."
2,Disappointed,"We love the Smurfs, and have been waiting anxiously for The Magic Flute to come out, having remembered seeing it on TV years ago. We were very disappointed in the movie because the voices of the characters were not the familiar ones we remember, and they were definitely not the same as the cartoon episodes that were recently released. Why would the voices be changed? It really ruined the movie for us. If we had known, we would never have purchased this movie. For me sound is very important, and not only the voices, but the music as well was not the familiar tune or arrangements. The sound quality was fine, but we did not enjoy the new voices and music."
4,Only on VHS,"This Smurffy movie is only availible on Smurfatable VHS, but that is better than nothin'. It's worth watchin'!"
2,Sad,"Was so excited to get this video and then I started watching it with my kids I was upset. The voices were all wrong and the songs were wrong and they called Peewit, William the whole movie. It wasn't till later that I learned this was the UK dub version. I know my kids wont know the diference but I'm really upset with it and I won't be able to watch it. Really thinking about sending it back. Very upset and sad."
2,United Kingdom English dub,"THIS IS NOT THE AMERICAN ENGLISH DUB!!! If you were hoping to get the American English dub, you'll be sorely disappointed with this release, because this one is the United Kingdom English dub, which is terrible in my opinion. The voice acting ranges from passable to terrible, and the songs with their lyrics aren't as catchy as the American English dub version. I'd give this one a serious pass unless you're that desperate to own a copy of the movie.An important thing of note is that Imavision, a Canadian video distributor, also released this movie in North America with the English and French voice tracks, and that also has the United Kingdom English dub, which is how I first came to know this problem."
2,a trifle disapointed,This is a great movie A few spoilers warnings yes it is more Johan and pewit than smurfs.This is befor smurfwtte or baby smurf joined the family. Nor is Gargamel anywhere near it. I had it On VHS and watched it recently the voice cast was changed I guess they thought the high pitch voices annoying but I grew up with it now it sounds like theyre mumbling. Worse yet pewiys voice is very much like Johans thats not an ugly voice just all wrong for him. I think I'll give the dvd to my Godson and stick to my vhs.
4,"Great movie, Not a Great Price.","This is one of the movies that I grew up with. I remember watching Smurfs and the Magic Flute on cable Showtime in the 80's. Only problem with this movie is that smurfs only come out in the movie maybe 20%. The rest of the movie is about Pee-Wee and Yohan and the king. But still the movie is great. I ordered this movie as soon as I saw it on Amazon, but when I went to Target today, the movie was only $9.99. Amazon charged me $13.57. From now on, I'm going to check Target first before buying any movie from Amazon. The four stars is for the movie, not the price."
4,Must have~~~,This book is a must have - coffee table book!!! Everyone needs a little inspiration and simply put guidance now and again! Love this little book!!!
2,Okay.....,I started reading this book and I didn't find it much help in the confidence division. It did not resonate with me at all. I tried picking it up a few more times and it didn't keep my interest so I put it back on the shelf.
1,Hazardous product,"I ordered this for Christmas. The TV never worked but he liked playing the radio and his cds. During the second week of January, it started to smoke and my husband (a contactor) said the internal mechanisms were fried becasue the regulator was discharging 18 volts vs. the 13 volts the specifications called for. I notified Amazon and they replaced it for free. Before my sone was allowed to use it, my husband tested it and this regulator was putting out 18.5 volts. I notified Amazon Customer Service and would not reccommend this unit to anyone.Thank you."
2,Pads okay but not very sticky,The pads work fine but the adhesive is not very sticky and the pads after the third or forth use do not adhere to the skin at all.
1,Dreadful!,"They lose their ""stick"" basically immediately. I have on a new set that I literally just put on for the first time, and they are sliding down my back. Useless. Save your money!"
1,Macintosh users beware!,"If you are a Mac user and thinking of using the Buffalo Linkstation as a NETWORK STORAGE DEVICE for a MEDIA SERVER you can do much better! I ordered this with the hope of using it to store and serve iTunes and iPhoto. 1. The instructions for getting it set up we're either out of date or Buffalo hadn't hooked up a Mac to see how it currently works. Instructions for the Mac were pretty much 'you're on you own'. After some troubleshooting I got it working. 2. The download times were unbeliveably slow! It didn't support Appletalk or Extended Appletalk. I had to revert to using SMB protocol... 54 hours to download 8 gigs! I think not. I called their support team and they essentially shrugged their shoulders... Mac's were not their thing. I ended up sending it back and getting a LaCie ...same size storage for $20 less. Set up was a breeze. Appletalk was supported, also Unix, Linux & Windows. 8 gigs downloaded in 45 minutes! That's more like it! Hope this helps your decision."
2,"Good hardware,,,, with no software or support","Linkstation makes amazing hardware, but fails to give good software for the same... you will need to install a third party software to use most of the features. Good hardware... but software sucks...bottom line: its a good body with no soul"
1,No Humor or Love When Inflicting Pain on Babies & Children,"The Pearls, sick bullies, pretend to be loving, Christian parents. How's this for ""context""?p.30-31 Michael Pearl describes sitting on a little 7 year old boy while tying him up: ""I couldn't allow this boy to grow up without respect for 'the powers that be.' So I obtained a fifteen-foot length of cord and chased him down. I weigh 230 pounds, and I am six feet, four inches tall. He is about four feet tall and weighs about fifty pounds. I had to sit on his head and shoulders to work the cord through the loops of his pants. To be true to my threat, after securing his pants, I ran the cord up over his shoulders, like suspenders, and down around his legs, drawn up like a calf, and finally tying one hand to his waist where his foot was tied."""
1,Don't use this book,"Looking for parenting help & guidance? Don't be taken in; this book has many destructive ideas masquerading as God's love. Children don't need to be hit or spanked (or entrapped with situations that tempt disobedience just so you can give them a smack and teach them otherwise). Honestly, this is not even common sense. I know so many people--including colleagues, friends, and my own children--who were never spanked in any way and are loving, generous, enthusiastic, hard-working, and disciplined. They bring joy and make good contributions to the world. Many are people of deep faith. Of course you can have loving, consistent discipline without hitting in any way! Rearing children is not a choice between spanking and no limits. Don't be tempted into this damaging approach."
1,These People Even Make God Cry,"Anyone who truly knows the Word of God knows that this book is pure child abuse, NOT the true Word of God. The Pearls are bullies & cowards, nothing more. The cruelty that they spout out is nothing short of disgusting. I pray that no one buys this book or ever listens to another word from these horrible, horrible childhood killers."
1,child abuse manual,it even says to have a 6-year-old whip a 1-year-old. these people should be in jail not making money selling this garbage.
1,Violent parenting begets angry and depressed children,"Consequences of society's tolerance of violence against children:As a society, we reap what we sow: Violence begets more violence, as well as a host of other problems. Thirty years of research has consistently found that corporal punishment in all forms increases the risk for anger and aggressiveness in children. Corporal punishment also has been found to increase the risk for the following physical, psychological, sexual and social problems:Physical injuryEscalation to legally defined physical abuseSexual abusePost Traumatic Stress DisorderDepressive DisorderPoor self esteemSuicidal IdeationJuvenile aggression and violenceSibling violenceDomestic violence in adulthood towards own partner and childrenSadomasochistic paraphilias (fetishes)"
1,wierdo author,This philosophy is basically how you can beat you kids and still interact with them with a smile on your face. It has lots of fun anecdotes and then is riddled with wierd ways to enforce your control over your kids. I was raised this way and I was so obedient I went off and joined a cult at age 18 and followed the cult leader with intensity. It took years for me to realize what was wrong with this kind of parenting! Don't raise your kids this way! In his newsletter the author suggests you use weed waker cable to whip your kids! How psycho is that?!
1,This Book Advocates CHILD ABUSE!!!!,"The Pearl's belief that whipping innocent babies will cause them to behave is CHILD ABUSE!!Reading excerpts from this book brought tears to my eyes. What decent human being would take a wooden paddle and beat a child on the back of their legs because they won't stop crying? The description of an infant being beaten until it ""whimpered in submission"" made me cry. All this book does is advocate child abuse in the name of discipline.Too bad there isn't a ""no star"" rating. This book should not be on Amazon!"
1,Child Abuse - The sequal,"Ridiculous and disgusting. You cannot strike someone out of love. Abuse is abuse, no matter how you dress it up. Beating your children into stoic submission is not child rearing.If you were to use these methods with an animal, you would be charged with animal abuse. How is that acceptable for children?"
1,Another vile book on how to teach kids violence.,"Pearl hasn't done his homework. Children who are ""disciplined"" using physical force (a.k.a. violence) are taught that when you don't get what you want, use force. He is clueless to the scientific research in brain neurobiology that when you use violence on children, it alters their brain structure toward violence, and actually turns on the DNA for violent behaviors. 90% of all incarcerated males were beaten as children - doesn't that tell you something? Statistically, the beaters were usually beaten themselves. ""The sins of the parents shall be visited upon the children""."
1,This Book will Turn Your Kids into BULLIES!!!!,"This book will turn your kids into bullies! It all begins with the parents using the WRONG forms of discipline! This book tells you to spank your kids! And being hit (and I can tell you from experience) that the bullies that hit me in school were spanked by their parents and one got the belt! And guess what! These bullies hit me and other's because these bullies were being hit themselves and they think they're supposed to hit other kids! These books that say parents must spank their kids, well there are other kids suffering because of this and I am living proof!!!!"
1,Jesus says: Don't buy this book!,"I have to wonder about the folks giving this book 5 star ratings. Perhaps they're only reading the parts about homeschooling and Barbie dolls. If they actually read the whole book they'd find many sections that are advocating severe child abuse such as sitting on a tiny child's head and whipping infants and toddlers over and over again, many times during the day. The basic theme of the book is to break the child's will starting in infancy. It's an ego trip for the parents. This is not Christian, this is abuse of human beings. Amazon shouldn't sell books that advocate abuse."
1,Unbelievable,"Imagine how you would feel being beaten with a switch - and then imagine being treated so by the person you love and trust the most - on whom your life depends; and imagine being completely powerless about and being beaten even more if you protested or cried - imagine knowing you could never escape - then multiply it by a million and you're close to knowing how a child feels. What survives this ""discipline"" is no longer a person - an empty shell of a human being, destined to mindlessly repeat the violence on its children, robbed of all empathy and reason. Unless they are lucky enough to open their eyes and call what was done to them by its name - a crime. Self-immune diseases, depression, self-hatred and abusive, unhealthy relationships are just some of the consequences scientifically proved to stem from a violent upbring. It is never loving to hit a child. Your children trust you unconditionally. Try to deserve their trust, do not give them lies and hatred."
1,Upsetting,"I would not recommend this book to parents because of the strong reliance on corporal punishment it suggests. If you make children behave by hitting them, what do you do when they become too big to hit?In general, the techniques taught in this book go against everything the American Psychiatric Association suggests. Their studies find that children treated in this manner will be more likely to act out and rebel against authority. Just because all children who are hit do not have problems does not mean that many of them don't. Another warning: a woman who accidentally killed her foster child claimed that she was following the instructions in this book. Overall, not a good guide to raising emotionally healthy children."
3,True Christian values,"A few of the reviewers here who dislike ""No Greater Joy"" are claiming that the values and methods it teaches are an affront to Christianity.However, if you've actually read the Bible -- the whole Bible, not just the ""favorite"" parts that its advocates like to quote -- you'll find that what the authors of ""No Greater Joy"" are recommending for child discipline is very MILD compared with the actual recommendations of the Bible. ""No Greater Joy"" does not, for example, advocate putting your children to death for cursing you (c.f. Exodus 21:17 and Leviticus 20:9).This is yet another reason why using religious belief as a guide for life will only lead to misery and despair."
5,Wonderful,"These 3 books give so much helpful advise to Christian parents who want to raise their children by Biblical means. We trust God to know what is best for our children, not what our ever changing society seems to think they know. Look at children today, you think the new style is better than what God perscribed? I guess if you think it is good for the child to run around whinning when they don't get their way and have no self control, unless it suits them."
1,This book advocates child abuse,Children should never be whipped or struck. Period.Shame on Amazon for selling this material.
1,freaks,"How can humans have such pure evil in them? The innocence of a child is destroyed by such abuse, why do you think there are so many mentally ill people out there? It IS ABUSE, no other way around it!!! It is sad, sick, discusting, and evil. Those people need to be taken away by men in white coats!"
5,Read Their Children.,"For anyone looking for proof of the methods the Pearls teach; you need only read their children. They are grown, with children of their own. They have their own articles available online. As for someone reading their books and commiting child abuse; they should have read ALL of the instructions. To injure a child after reading their books, you must have selected which words to heed very carefully. Much the same as if I encouraged you to go home, sit down and eat with your children: You decided to go home, sit down and eat your children!"
5,This product actually works!,"After a horrible experience with Garnier Blow Dry perfecter which caused me to loose some hair and have thinner patches, I turned to this product. It is great to spray in your roots or to just spray all over. I love it and it makes your hair noticeably thicker. I used it on my mother who has straight flat hair and it also made her hair so much more voluminous. She is not one to care that much about fancy products but asked me what it was and where she could get it. Great product for the price."
4,"Smelly, but nice.","I bought this product because my hair is very fine and flat at my roots, but has volume at the end. The shipping was really wonky and I couldn't track it for some weird reason, but it came faster than expected. The box it came in contained free samples of 2 products (a wrinkle cream, and a perfume bottle) and I'm not sure why, but I'm not complaining! I ordered it from frangrencenet, so order from them if you want free samples! It also came with a free compact mirror. Anyway, the volumizer smells bad at first, but it is worth it! It is not a hair spray sort of smell, it smells more than it has fruity fragrances in it to try to cover up the chemically spray, but they mixed together. It makes my hair very thick and nice, but I sprayed some on my ears and now they are VERY itchy.To sum it up-Order from fragrence netBe careful not to spray on skinGet used to the smell!"
2,ugg,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! very sticky and just makes your hair flat and dull there must be something better out there. still looking for the righr one
5,Impressive,"I'm not a great chess player (ELO1600) so who am I to assess Jeremy Silman's chess? But I am a good student and I know a good teacher when I see one. Some things here are out of my reach but only for now. What a great learning tool this has been for me. This is the best kind of book, one you grow into and go back to over and over. It's not a one-time read so you will never find this book at Good Will."
5,How to Reassess Your Chess,"This is a great book. Author did a fantastic job in explaining chess, strategy. It's cntains very important materials and easy to read. I have gained 300 points after reading this book myself! This is a MUST HAVE book that you just have to read!"
1,I'm not a master,"I think I'm above average intelligence and somewhat competent at chess. Since playing on my iPod against the computer, I've realized I'm not so good. This book, however, is beyond me. It is quite advanced, and I wouldn't recommend it for the casual chess fan."
5,Chess Player's Bible,"Jeremy Silman's masterpiece teaches the chess enthusiast how to properly assess a chess position and what to strive for in order to win. It is a true foundation for building an understanding of positional principles and is written in a clear, easy to understand, and often funny style. I am a National Chess Master and instructor and this book is my secret weapon."
4,Great Backpack! Quirky Color.,"This is a sturdy backpack that will easily accomodate your 15.4"" laptop. Pockets are plentiful and well made. Zippers are sturdy. Lots of storage and great padding. This will be our family's third Maxxum.The grey color is actually silver so the picture above doesn't accurately reflect how flashy the color is. So if you don't mind looking like one of the extras from an early eighties ""Funkytown"" video, it's a great choice."
4,All good except for one zipper,"This backpack is great at this price. One zipper on the large middle pouch doesn't zip very easily, but is not really faulty. Ample and varied kinds of space, comfy shoulder straps. The padded laptop case is appropriate for my 13"" macbook, but a larger one would still fit.Someone else posted a review about the grey/silver color looking silly, but I think it looks fine. Overall a very good backpack."
5,Really good backpack,"Whenever I travel and I don't have any luggages, this is wha I use. Enough space for computer, camers, accessories and some clothes. Really good for carry on. No matter the weight fits very good on your back and you cannot fill the weight."
5,SwissGear by Wenger/Fabulous buy,So pleased. More value than I expected. Shipped on time. Very satisfied.
5,Great Quality and Comfort,"This is a great backpack for laptop user. The feel is very nice and there are plenty of padding on the shoulder straps and the on the back of the backpack. Also, there are more compartments than a normal person would need.Here are some more specifics:It will fit up to 6"" of text books not including my laptop (1.5"")It will not fit laptops that are bigger than 14"" x 10.5""It has quick access compartment for MP3 player (which also have a slot for headphones wirings) and other small electronics."
3,Very big and overwhelming,"I needed a backpack that would securely store my 12"" iBook and a change of clothes on vacation, so I bought this on sale here at Amazon. When I got it, I was surprised at how big it was. Even though I didn't have much in it, it bulged out. There are so many compartments that are hard to access quickly. I also had trouble fitting it underneath the seat in front of me on the airplane.I'm sure many people will find this backpack very useful, like college students and such, but personally it wasn't the right bag for me. It did keep my laptop safe and secure though."
3,strong & heavy computer backpack,This bag is really strong and has a lot of cushion for laptops. But it's very heavy and big I wouldn't like to carry it around without my laptop. It occupies a lot of space even if there is no laptop inside.
4,Nice bag,"Good bag for the price. Only problem is when loaded up the bag is huge on my back. A shoulder bag can carry the same, but with a slim profile."
4,nice sturdy bag,"The bag is nice, with lots of storage space and different conpartments. The laptop conpartment is well-padded and secure. I don't like the look of the bag, but you can't complain given the price is so low."
5,Dixie Chicks at their best!,Excellent debut by the Dixie Chicks. A must to add to your music video collection.
5,"Cuddle up to a fire, pop open a bottle of wine, and enjoy...","This is one awesome performance. I saw the NBC special in December and loved it, so I knew I had to buy the DVD when it came out. The picture and sound quality are impeccable - right up there with the Eagles DVD. It's an hour and a half of pure enjoyment. They perform their new Home CD plus a few of there classic songs. Natalie has the strongest voice I have ever heard and she can also get foot stompin' crazy like she does in White Trash Wedding. Amazing performance! The Chicks seem relaxed on stage as they joke with the audience in between songs so it makes it feel like they are in your living room. I wish there were more LIVE DVD's like this by other artists."
4,Chicks rock on!,"This work is a lively, fun-filled production that captures the girls in top form. They have worked much too hard to cave in to the backward thinking, Patriot Act loving hypocrites calling themselves Americans - the ones who boycott The Chicks for expressing their views. Hard to believe that so many Nazi-like people were following such an upbeat, cheerful band.Chicks rock on!"
5,D.C. ROCK!!!,"!!! ATTENTION FADING AND FUTURE ROCK STARS !!! Want to know how to promote your music? SEE THIS DVD!! Dixie chicks totally blew me away by allowing fans and others a ""sneak peak"" into their new album. This was done in an unpretentious way with humor and - most importantly - quality music. Rarely have I enjoyed a music dvd as much as this one. Usually I skip through the boring or tedious numbers and go straight for the fan-favorites...not on this one though. Every song transitioned smoothly to the next and this performance really made you feel like you spent ""an evening with the Dixie Chicks."" Well worth every penny ... (and it's inexpensive too!) KEEP IT UP DIXIE CHICKS."
2,Nothing to brag about.,"I used to like the Chicks and watched a friend's copy of the DVD. The music is good, but I won't be buying any for myself. As already mentioned, the editing is terrible. I think they'll have much more success marketing this product in Europe, where I'm sure they are very popular these days."
1,An Evening with the Dixie Chicks,Let's give our money to artists that support a country that puts money into their bank accounts. These three are not it.
1,Ban the Chicks,"Natalie should be banned in the USA and stay out of Texas! To have been raised in the Lone Star state she is a disgrace. ""Don't Mess with Texas"""
3,Overly Bright and Harsh Vocal Mix Spoils Performance,"Hmmm...why does this happen. A great concert moment spoiled by poor engineering. This isn't the first time.I have ~35-40 Music Concert DVD's I listen to often. I know a good recording when I hear one. Plenty of examples (e.g. Diana Krall Live in Paris - DTS, Billy Idol VH1 Storytellers - DTS, Eagles Hell Freezes Over - DTS, etc.)Unfortunately the engineers mixing this recording failed miserably. The naturally ""piercing"" voice of lead singer Natalie Maines comes across as extremely harsh and fatiguing. So very disappointing.I know every combination of electronics and speakers can sound different, but my combination sounds stellar on 99% of the various music DVD's and SACD's I own.Buyer beware."
3,An Evening with the Dixie Chicks DVD,"I was real excited when I saw this released on DVD with 5.1 channel digital audio.....that is until I heard it....the audio is very disappointing! If I wanted to listen to the Dixie Chicks in Monoraul, I would listen to them on my transistor radio... Come on ladies....give us something exciting...I am still waiting.....................get a new sound man...."
3,Nice concert and Worst video editing,"The performance is very good. I also think the sound is nice.But video editing is the worst. I am not comfortable to see that. The changing of camera angle is terrible. Without that, this DVD is the best of the best."
1,Bluegrass Feel Doesn't Translate In Big Hall,"The Dixie Chicks would've done better if they had performed this concert in a bluegrass/country atmosphere--someplace where traditional music of that genre is performed. This performance in this elegant recital hall is forced and unnatural.While they are adept at their craft, the DC's ""pop"" facade in this concert falls flat. The set list is also unimaginative. Their album ""Home"" is performed from start to finish, without break. The audience is ""rewarded"" with old DC faves ""Goodbye Earl"" and ""Sin Wagon"" only at the end. One feels like the crowd was just hanging around to hear the familiar old songs.Not a strong effort."
5,Mesmerising ! Wish there was a Blu-ray version of this...,"I purchased this DVD a while back and have listened to it a million times. The songs are just mesmerising. I dearly wish they would release a Blu-ray version of this DVD. After getting used to the quality that is possible from blu-ray, this is one product that I would definitely buy in blu-ray, cost no bar ! Love it."
5,Equal Footing,"Olson is well qualified to write on the history of science and religion, having published at least two previous books (Science Deified and Science Defied, vols. 1 and 2). I enjoyed those books, but this one is even better. Packed with interesting details, well researched, and well written, it maintains a calm, balanced historian's perspective. In particular, Olson uses broad historical scholarship to demonstrate the range of religious and other cultural responses to the advance of science -- everything from the typical images of irrational resistance to the eager adoption of scientific knowledge as a SOURCE or DEFENSE of religious ideas."
2,Just Average,"Once again another spam program that is supposed to be good and isn't. It's OK. I actually decided to remove the software and I gave it away after two weeks. I don't enjoy going through an extra folder just to remove or accept emails. This program added work as opposed to cutting down on email time.It wasn't horrible, just OK."
4,Valuable Resource,"Though the prices are out of date the information the book contains is valuable as it is closer to the source when it was printed than now. It shares the number of cars produced for the type, original cost, and a ballpark figure of a potential future price. Pictures are included along with a description and a 'For' and 'Against' as it pertains to owning the vehicle. A good handy reference to have on hand."
2,The references are 99% wrong.,The references to scripture are 99% wrong. The person translating the text on the footnotes did a very poor job. But the text itself seems to be fine. One can still get the true thoughts from the original writer out of it. But don't go looking for the scripture to correspond to the passage. I recommend purchasing another version/translation of this book.
1,Utter Garbage,"I think this book isn't even biblical in many of the things it states, such as ""others may ask and receive, but you shall ask and not obtain"".How can anyone think this book is from God when it declares such nonsense that is contradictory to the Words of Christ?This book I thought was going to be good, but it really made me depressed for a long time because of some of the attitudes of Thomas Kempis, as if you were only meant to experience sorrow and suffering, because that is pretty much all he focused on. Looks like the life of a monk. Please don't read this if you are a follower of Christ and know what the Bible says.Jacob"
3,Hards to read.,Difficult to read & enjoy this old english version. I have since purchased a modern english version & enjoy it much more.
5,A Must Read,This book should be read by anyone who is serious about being on the spiritual journey. It should be read as short passages on a daily basis with time to reflect allowed.
3,Catching up on the classics,"The first 1/3rd of this classic is a quick read. After then, it begins to drag a little slower. IT is a good text to read during Adoration."
5,Daily reminders,I am so grateful for this book. Kempis' entries are gentle reminders of God's love for me and the need to take time to reconsider my daily priorities.
5,Great!,"My pastor said this was ""the best devotional book ever written."" I have to agree with him. Great devotions for each day."
5,A treasure.,"A spiritual classic, for good reason. Unpretentious religious guidance on how to know and love God, and be a better member of the human race. Unsentimental, not sappy or superficial like contemporary ""Chicken Soup"" style books. Profound and beautiful language. This book belongs on the bedside table or desk of every Christian, or any person who wants to delve into the beauty of a sincere quest for truth and deeper meaning in life. This is a book to pick up again and again as the years go by."
1,Resets too easily,"Today is the first day that I've used this pedometer. I took the long trek from my car to my office, and when I got into the office, it said I had 900 steps, which is fairly accurate for a 1/4 mile walk. However, about 30 minutes later, I checked it and it was back at 100... Apparently i accidently reset it? Well needless to say, I've had it on for about 5 hours, and it has reset on me 3 times. Totally useless... It works great, with really good calculations, but I was suggest that they put some sort of lock button onto it."
4,"Fairly accurate, but...","The pedometer itself is very easy and fairly accurate, but the body fat analyzer only works up to a certain weight for each height."
2,Save your $$$,"Waste of $$$. Bought from New Balance, came with no instructions. Multi function keys impossible to figure out. No help available online."
4,Fun for play or display!,"This fun little set features wonderful elements from the movie ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" (ASIN: B00006IUH2)With Rain, Little Creek, a hitching post, wolf, eagle, camp fire and tipi, your little one will have hours of fun recreating scenes from the movie as well as creating their own ""deleted scenes"" ;)As this set is of the ""Stablemate"" scale (1:32), there are several small pieces that make it unsuitable for smaller children."
1,PAINFUL,"PLEASE do not buy this CD, it is absolutely PAINFUL to listen to. A very poor introduction to Lena and it will not satisfy anyone who loved her from the 1930s through the the mid-1980s. Lady & Her Music was a great show, she was 65 then and ""still had it"", but not here. The woman is over 80 here and sounds every day of it, why she had to make this CD is beyond me. If she needed cash she should have done more of those Gap commercials. The singing on this CD, most of the songs are great standards, is pathetic. WHY is it these older stars do not know when to quit? I'd give this negative stars if I could. STAY AWAY!"
1,Torn apart in minutes.,My small terrier tore this apart within 5 minutes; stuffing everywhere.Its no good.
3,knowing,Hess is a true artist. He understands that a great work speaks to each generation. The Singing Snails use a contemporary interpretation of mythology to spin a tail that has permanent resonance in every day life.
5,It's Good! :),Hey! well i think this video was pretty cool. If you are a Play fan you gotta get it b/c it gives you a glimpse into their lives and how they really are. It was really fun when they're in the studio recording songs & they paractice they choreography & go surfing. yea it makes me wanna be on tour with them :) I wish the video was more like a documentary so you can see what a whole day is like with them or whatever. But its pretty fun to watch. So just get it!
1,Really?!,"The 2013 edition of this same book can be purchased directly from Abeka (the publisher)for $15.90. take it from a friend, don't be fooled into purchasing an overpriced, out of date book."
2,Commercial book for an average reader,"I was very excited to read that book.But very shortly, my disappointment took me by surprise. Primitive writing, simple sentences, hackneyed subject used by so many writer in order to make some $$$Seems like writer was in a rush to finish the book, many ideas have suffered a premature death. I believe, it is a shame that nowadays an ordinary (not to say pathetic) writer like that can get a Noble prize.This book could be so much more, if given in the hands of a talented person!If you are really looking for quality reading on the subject, I highly recommend Thomas Mann."
5,The ancient history of Jesus told in a fantasitc new way!!,"Saramago is one of the best authors of all times. The simplicity and humanity of his books are the essential ingredient of this Gospel. He tells the history of Jesus Christ, his relations with his parents, the world, God and Satan in an astonishing way, surprising the reader with intrincate and human relationships between the characters, and keeping our attention until the last word, to an outstanding end. After I finished reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking about it for a very long time, digesting all its parts. It's a book to savor every well-placed words."
