2,Does not appeal to male readers,"I was looking for a new mystery writer and thought I would check out Janet Evanovich. I know she certainly appeals to a lot of people and maybe my expectations were too high based on that. But I think I did not like it because it was just not written to appeal to a male reader. So, since there were no reviews that I saw that offered up a warning, I thought I would offer one. If you are a male this probably will not appeal to you. If I am wrong about this, I would like someone to correct me and perhaps offer a suggestion for another book by Janet that I might find more to my liking."
4,Seven Up by Janet Evanovich,"My daughter and I read this book to each other during a very boring, rainy, yard sale day. She had never read any of her books before. We both laughed until we cried. You cannot help but laugh while reading this series of books. You forget all your worries."
1,"Oh, Please!","I have to admit that I could not finish this book. After having struggled through two previous efforts, I thought I would give Evanovich one more chance to convince me that she had an original thought. Not to be. Her characters are caricatures - I've met them all elsewhere (and didn't like them much there either), and the Stephanie character strains all credibility. Every action and word is predictable - and predictably ""kooky"". She make the most obvious and stupid mistakes - over and over again. When the old man with the enlarged prostate gave her the slip twice in the first few chapters, I had had enough.Please - put this series out of its misery!"
4,Up To Her Old Tricks,"It's hard to keep straight which of Ms. Evanovich's novels are which, and since I don't have the book at hand right now, I just have to say it's more of the hilarious interactions among Stephanie, Joe, Ranger, her mother, her grandmother, and various slippery characters with rather unpleasant traits. I found these fun to read aloud so that someone else can laugh with you."
3,A big disappointment!,"I have waited a year for this book to come out. I was very disappointed. Are we sure Janet Evanovich really wrote this book? Where is all the humor from the other 6 books. The people all seemed flat and uninteresting, as was the story. All I can say is that I am not looking forward to book 8."
2,Seven Down,"I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series about two years ago, and throughly enjoyed the previous six books. Unfortunately, seven is not a lucky number for the series. What I loved about the previous books was Stephanie's snappy, quirky humor, and her knack for finding herself in outrageous situations. Very few of these elements can be found in this book. Stephanie comes off as boring, the mystery is too weird, there is not enough interaction with Lula, and the whole Morelli-Stephanie-Ranger triangle is tiresome. This book reads more like a rough draft than a novel ready for publication. I hope that if there is a book eight that more time and attention is put into it."
3,This Seven Up is flat,"Easy read but nothing new, not as funny or sexy as her previous work. The big draw back was the lack of dialogue to move the story, in the previous 6 Evanovich's her use of dialogue has been fantastic. This book is much more narrative and looses the depth of characters. The Joe/Stephanie on-off again theme, Ranger should she or not, and space cadet pot heads were done better in the previous books so try to borrow it instead of buying. And spend your money on one of her earlier works."
2,Totally Disappointed,"WELLLLLLL-???? I have read and re-read all of the Stephanie Plum series.... I must say I was terribly disappointed by this one. It does pick up at the end of the book... It is almost like the Publishers or SOMEONE is Pushing Janet too hard to produce... I certianly hope they STOP NOW... This is a great writer with a great series going... Her readers look forward Excitedly to each and every new book.. I have even searched out and purchased FIRST EDITIONS of all the others... GRANDMA Mazur who in my estimation is one of her best ever charactors after, Joe , Ranger and of course Stephanie. Grandma was almost non-exsistant in this one and what she did have to offer she was blindfolded most the time... DEFINATELY TO MUCH BOB the munchy pooch...It was almost like Janet had some great ideas but had not enough time to really develop them fully.. SO WHOEVER OR WHATEVER IS PRESSURING JANET STOP..... STOP... PLEASE STOP... WE WANT MORE OF THE OLD STEPHANIE BACK......WEGE"
3,disappointing,"Not as funny or interesting as any of the others. No character development other than Grandma's libido and the ""tension"" between Steph and Ranger/Morelli. More of the same, but we;ve read it already. nothing new, and not even a fire in the funeral parlor."
4,"It deserves a three star rating, but I just couldn't do it","That's right, this book was not nearly as good as the other six. The only reason I did not give it a three star rating is because I like Stephanie Plum and Grandma Majur so much. This book did not have the humor that the others had. Even the romance was slacking. I will not tell you NOT to buy it, just don't buy it brand new. Wait for a used copy, or paperback. I was so anxious for this book, that I ordered it from Amazon.com about six weeks before it came out. And, I will probably do the same for #8."
3,"Yeah, it had Laughs","I must agree with the other reviewer: this book did have laughs but it is nowhere even NEAR the first three books in this series. I was no fan of Four to Score, Hot Six and now Seven-Up. The marketing ploy with the cliffhanger at the end is ridiculous. I'm afraid that this will be my last book. Also, I don't care for the direction she is going with this series, this love triangle between Morelli and Ranger needs to stop. What started out as a mystery series has started out into something else entirely and I do not care for it. Happy reading to those who have read something else while I wasted my time reading this. I highly recommend that you WAIT to buy this book in paperback. The best books in this series were the first three, and High five. That is it. I had such high hopes....such high expectations.....don't waste your money."
3,More Plum pits,"OK, Evanovich is kind of a one-trick pony. Her protagonist, Stephanie Plum is about the most unlikely bounty hunter you can imagine, and her all-to-human errors in her job performance are completely predictable if you have read any of the previous Plum novels. Yet, I keep buying the books and reading them as I eat potato chips. You can't eat just one, even thought they all taste alike. At least I did wait for the paperback edition of this one.In this episode, Plum is after old Eddie DeChooch who is in trouble himself for having stolen the heart from the corpse of a mafia-type. The old guy keeps escaping Stephanie's inept clutches, but Stephanie is intrepid in the hunt. Her surrounding cast -- Vinnie, Lula, Ranger, Morelli and the lovable Grandma Mazur are always amusing. And in this novel we meet her perfect sister for the first time. You'll learn more of her in ""Hard Eight"" now in hardback.It's funny fluff!"
5,Another great adventure for the Jersey girl,"I eagerly awaited it's arrival, showed up at my local bookstore on release day and finished it in one night. I love this series! I can't wait for 8! I laugh out loud and always close the book wanting more."
2,"Perhaps the next title should be ""Eight Is Enough.""","After devouring the first six Plums in a matter of weeks, I anxiously awaited number seven. It seems the author rushed to publish. ""Seven Up"" is way below par. Weak plot development, under-use of the characters we've come to love, too reliant on raunch, very little of the sparkling dialog and chancy encounters we've come to expect, and no suspense. Disappointing. I'll probably read the next installment, but not before digesting a few reviews."
2,Seven is one too much,"Puhleeeeze. Okay the book is somewhat humerous and halfway well written, but come on now. Just give me one scene that is halfway believable. I like my fluffy summer reading junk too, but this one stinks like Jersey. So enjoy it before you tire of it and also enjoy 8, 9 10..... and so on.You will make the next ones #1 anyway before reading Page 1 or 2 or 3......"
4,Another great book in the series,I love the Stephanie Plum books. Seven Up was another great storyline with the classic laugh out loud Stephanie moments! I highly recommend if you're a fan.
3,Much Ado About Not Much,"Normally, the books in this series zing along like a brakeless roller coaster greased with butter. Normally. Although all the elements usually found in the Plum series are in this book, they don't seem to emerge naturally. The humor, plot, and situations that are present seem to be randomly thrown together, and the result is a book that's okay to pass the time with, but not one that makes me recommend this to others. The addition of Stephanie's sister to the characters adds nothing to the story, and merely serves to add another crazy character to a series rich with crazy characters. The real proof to me that this book is not up-to-par with Evanovich's other offerings is that my mother-in-law didn't read past chapter 3, and normally she finishes off one of these novels like Lula can finish off a Big Mac."
2,...,"If you want to read this book, wait until it comes out in paperback... I just loved this series for the first several books, but it's gone downhill, and in truth I don't know if I'll even read ""Crazy If You Pay for Eight."" There is virtually no plot in Seven Up, and the tired same-old, same-old characters do little to disguise this fact. There's nothing new, including the ending, which is yet another ""cliffhanger""... When the series was better, this contrivance worked, obvious and money hungry as it was. By now, however, I at least am so bored with the Stephanie-Joe-Ranger scenario that it matters not to me what they do. This series needs a major overhaul, or maybe it just needs to end. There are a few very gifted writers who can keep a series going, each book a masterpiece of depth and good, solid writing. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that Ms. E. is one of these writers."
2,Disappointed,"I have not read any other of her books, but I was disappointed with this one. Really silly, juvenile and amateurish."
5,"Won't Let You Down If you Like ""Stephanie Plum""","The Stephanie Plum series are so funny. My husband and I both enjoy these books and Seven Up is just as good as the rest. It is a great Summer Read. We read it in one day while on vacation, it was a fabulous relaxing form of entertainment. Stephanie, Granda Mazur, Ranger and Joe Morelli are at their best."
5,Too Funny,"I think the Evonovich novels are a riot. They take you on a wild romp through the streets with Evonovich's hero- Stephanie Plum. From grandmothers and dysfunctional families to funerals to boyfriends, these are hands down, some of the funniest books I have read. ANXIOUSLY awaiting number 8 (and more)."
1,Not fun like her other books,"I found Seven Up to be too crude to be fun, especially with Beastiality comments. Too, too offensive. Also, story was not fleshed out well enough as in the first six books in this series. I LOVED her other Stephanie Plum books, which I have read with enjoyment at least twice."
5,We loved the book but...,"I am an avid book reader and love Janet Evanovich's books, including the last one, Seven Up. I,my daughter and her friends loved the book. However, we did not like the voice of the reader as much. We much prefered the origional, Debi Mazar, in the other tapes. We finally had to go back to just reading the book. We are waiting with bated breath for the next book, and tape to come out. My daughter is hoping Stephanie will chose Ranger, and I want Joe Morelli to be the one."
1,Disappointing to say the least,The writing is as weak as the plot in this book. There are a few moments of humor found within and those are the only saving grace. Very disappointed in this book from cover to cover.
2,So-So,"I waited so long for #7 that I order the unabridged audio and the book. The lady on the audio was less than standard. Her Joe Morelli was laughable! Ruined the whole thing. All the characters were very nasally(?) So, I bought the book and started at Chapter 4. Finished it faster than the audio. I donated it to my local library so someone else can get disappointed too. As to the rest of the story, it was OK and Janet does it to us again at the end. She made Morelli look like a jerk and Ranger does not appear until way into the middle of the book. Next time I will wait for the library version."
2,A Long-Awaited Disappointment,"Don't get me wrong - I have been a devoted Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum fan since her first book in the series. They are absolutely my favorites! However, after all the hype, in my opinion Seven Up fell far short of her others -- it didn't even sound like Janet, but rather someone else plugging in the formula and spitting out a plot. I will anxiously await the next book in hopes that Janet will be back."
2,eight is enough?,"although there are some funny moments and ms plum's character is still very entertaining, the author has crossed the line from funny and entertaining to vulgarity. i sincerely hope she'll refrain from repeating this in her next book, or eight will definitely be enough."
2,A Letdown,"I waited with baited breath for this book and boy what a let down. The reader just does not cut it and I believe had the book been read by C.J. Critt (as the others were) it might have been so much better. I enjoyed the other 6 so much but this one was slow, contrieved and anti climatic. I hope book 8 lives up to it's six predecesors"
3,Not her best effort,"I've been a fan of Stephanie since her debut. But it seems that this particular venture isn't quite as put together as the rest have been. I also found that Evanovich's focus on bathroom humor and sexual ineptitudes somewhat irritating. Enough is enough! The plot is interesting and entertaining, but she didn't spend much time on development of her core characters. ""Eight"" should be interesting and I'm waiting to see how she resolves some of the relationships."
3,Slightly Disappointing,"After waiting an entire year for 7 up to arrive, I have to say it is not up to par with other Evanovich's novels. There weren't any parts that I truly laughed out loud, maybe a giggle, but not a true belly laugh with tears streaming down my face that Evanovich usually brings. Again, the usual characters are all accounted for, with Steph's perfect sister brought back home, having been dumped by her husband for the babysitter. Ranger is absent for most of the book, with really just a cameo appearance at the end, which AGAIN, leads to another cliff hanger. My recommendation, wait for the paperback.Thanks for reading, **Pandora"
3,Just Okay,Let me say first off that I love this series and will always be interested in Stephanie Plum's wacky life. However this wasn't the strongest book in the series. Some of the situations such as the Joyce Barnhart stun gun thing are getting really old! Even Grandma Mazur's getting to be a bit tiresome. I'd be interested to know more about some of the other characters like Lula and Ranger and I hope Evanovich will give us something more in depth and funny next time around. She seems to be relying on the same old situations and they're wearing a little thin.
3,A Personal Opinion,I have absolutely loved the Stephanie Plum books and was practically on the edge of my chair in anticipation for Seven Up. Unfortunately I did not find Seven Up nearly as absorbing and funny as the others. I can only hope that any future Stephanie Plum novels will return to the previous entertainment quality.
3,Half and Half,"I tried the audio version because I have a long ride back and forth to work. Instead of amusing me, the voice irritated me, especially, when she tried for Joe Morelli. Joe and Ranger are gods to me and one should not make them sound like girls trying to sound like boys. Hey, I'm fussy with my men. So, I bought the book and went on from there Chapter 7. A few good laughs as ususal, more zany characters and the usual cliffhanger. Janet has not lost a fan in me; am just a little disappointed."
4,A fun read.,"I love the characters, especially our bumbling bounty hunter. As in most of her books there are some laugh out loud moments."
4,Seven Up,These books are great. They make you really laugh. I am now on #10 and would recommend them all. Lula and Grandma Mazur are a hoot and Stephanie gets into more messes!
4,"Seven Up, Janet Evanovich","I am a fan of Stephanie Plum the so-called ditsy heroine of this series of books. She gets in to more scrapes, and burns up more automobiles. Without a doubt this is one of the best of the series. Its a ""can't put it down"" sort of story. Thank you Ms. Evanovich for a fun read."
2,Disappointed in Seven -- not so good as the others,"I loved One through Six, but I think the author has run out of material. This is not the Stephanie we know and love. Cheating on Joe with Ranger? No -- the Stephanie we have come to know has always been wacky, but would not fool around with another man while seriously dating and sleeping with Joe. Something went wrong with this book. I was disappointed."
2,Question???????,Was not happy that is wasn't factory sealed so I question if it is real or a knock-off?? So far it smells the same.
4,Kelsey's life So Far is good,"I came across So Far at the library and I was not planning on checking it out. But, once I started reading it, I could not put it down.Kelsey comes across as an average guy who has had many setbacks throughout his life. It was enjoyable to read about someone who accepted responsibility for his life without spending all of his time trying to blame someone for his problems.This book has made me appreciate Kelsey Grammer for being an incredibly talented actor who has never been afraid to take risks for his career. Also, it is enjoyable to read about someone who lives life to its fullest.So Far is a quick and easy read. I wish more books were like Grammer's autobiography."
2,So Far no good,didn't like it. he jumps around from topic to topic and acts like he knew predicted becoming a big TV star.
4,HA,"I have never seen Cheers. I came across Frasier once while watching TV and was instantly amazed with Kelsey Grammer. The old adage ""never judge a book by it's cover"" is most powerfully applied when it comes to this mid-nineties autobiography. What a corny, ostentatious appearance. But inside Mr. Grammer takes you through the tragedies of his childhood, the meanderings of his twenties and thirties, and finally what is Frasier Crane. You will identify with his tragedies and rejoice with his successes. He has experienced more than I can imagine and stands as a type of steadfastness, despite his shortcomings. Good one for your shelf."
2,"Great transaction, great dealer, fair book","My girlfriend and I have become late devotees of ""Frasier"". We have gobbled up and shared all of the seasons and watched them again and again. I looked forward to reading his, admittedly, early attempt at autobiography. The seller was wonderful and the book in superb condition as advertised. The book itself was disappointingly superficial offering much in the way of a career timeline but little real understanding of this very talented man."
3,Blah Blah Blah I am an actor,"The guy had a pretty tough life, I will give him that. But I really hate when actors take their ""craft"" too seriously. The guy is a sitcom actor, he is very popular, he has a very hot, very young wife and he should leave it at that. When he gets into all this stuff about acting with a dog, and how the dog is not an actor and he was offended, I wanted to take the pages and wipe my rear with them. I enjoyed the book though for the most part"
2,If only..,"Don't read this book if you want to like Kelsey Grammer afterwards. He is much like his famous character, Frasier. Pompous, selfish, a braggart who truly finds himself a gift to all. He spends most of the book gloating of himself and skims over the top of all the things that humanize him.The horrible loss of his sister, his grandparents, his life with his mother and father. If he had elaborated on his life stories rather than his celebrity ones, this book would've been brilliant.I think the key to enjoying Kelsey Grammer is to never read one of his books."
2,"Keep ""Frasier"" not ""Kelsey"" Image","One of the important times in my day is watch ing ""Frasier"" with family. A character which reflects how we long to behave like kids, how we yearn for fame and name and how stupid we are in missing the simple pleasures of our life. However, ""So Far.."" doesn't offer you any insight on any aspect except telling more about the personal life of Kelysey Grammer. The wit, satire, the timing you see on ""Frasier"" is totally missing in ""So Far.."". I would recommend reading the summary of the book and quick perusal, should you bump into this book."
5,How cool is this?,"My son loves it. I love it. We have 3 of these. I bought one here that was defective, contacted Amazon, they shipped a replacement out that same day by overnight. Stuff happens, Amazon fixes the issue. I love the lightsaber. Always wanted something like this as a kid, now I have a kid that wants one...I am still a total geek or what? The lightsaber rules! The old extend yourself that we have seem so plain now...."
4,Star Wars Force Action Lightsaber,"It is not bad for the price. The only thing is, the saber part does not glow solid. It only glows where the lights are placed in side. Not a bad product for the price."
2,Works halfway about half the time,"I'm surprised at the number of positive reviews for this item. I purchased two of them at the same time; this Luke version and one of the Vader ones. Out of the box they initially worked and then after about 3 minutes of proper use, they both malfunction. The Luke version would extend and retract, but the electronics were gone; no lights and no sound. The Vader version had the electronics work sporadically and mostly were reversed. It only has one button that extends the ""blade"" and turns on the lights and sound. They ended up reversed and would turn on when the blade was retracted and off when extended. Just realize what a cheaply made toy you're getting and you might not be disappointed."
5,His First Masterpiece,"This is his First Studio album. One of the best Albums of the 50s. Elvis has arguably the most recognizable voice in music history, buy this album and you will know why."
1,liars,"When I bought this i thought it was a really good deal, but when I got it, it only has 12 tracks on it, not 18 as it says it does. Its missing some of the more important songs, like heartbreak hotel! I bought this as a gift for my sister for xmas, bc she loves him, but im quite disappointed."
5,a front-row seat on history,"This first-hand account of some of the most momentous events of the twentieth century is an extremely compelling read. The account is lucid and engaging, but it's the analysis that takes it over the top. It was a pleasure to read."
3,Great Gag Gift,"I bought this as a gift for a true Star Wars fan and he loved it. While not everything in the book will be utlized, some of the recipes I have a feeling will be popping up around our house during Halloween."
3,It's Just Okay,"I'm looking for simple and the projects in this book are a little more complicated than I was willing to do. However, they are good ideas."
2,A little disappointed,I purchased this necklace for my daughter for Christmas. It came completely tangled up. It took me a good 30 minutes to untangle it and it still has a small knot in it that I can't get out. It is super tiny. The picture is really deceiving. It looks like a little kid's necklace. Not worth the money.
2,not great maybe just OK,"purchased this necklace for my girlfriend for $45 from amazon, so do not pay more. You may not want to pay less. Very cheaply made and extremely small. The picture does not do it justice. It came completely tangled up and took a good half hour to untangle. It is super tiny not worth the money."
5,Groundbreaking,"There's not many products these days that make you put it down for a couple of seconds, shake your head in disbelief and instantly insert your nose back into. By jingo, I bought two copies of this so I could plAY WHILE INVESTIGATING THE PUZZLES FURTHER ON. sIMPLY A GENIUS IDEA."
5,Best,"I love tic tac toe and I have no friends. The first fact is a gift, the second used to be a curse. Luckily now there is Solitaire Tic-Tac-Toe. I am no longer lonely because of this book. Thank you writer for writing it, and thank you God for putting me in touch with it. Please buy this book I can highly recommend it."
1,Religiously biased eugenicist forced to acknowledge scientific research,"This self-published work on the origins and nature of homosexuality would be a mea culpa of a wrong-headed, Bible-quoting bigot who is forced to acknowledge the biological basis of homosexuality, yet, in spite of the evidence he summarizes, Holland persists in maintaining that ""homosexuality is not part of human design."" Such arguments should please neo-Nazi eugenicists, but have no place in a legitimate review of the scientific literature.The redeeming value of this work is that a homophobic non-academic with a bachelor's degree in muscle physiology is forced to admit that homosexuals are ""born that way."""
1,Anti-gay Propaganda,"One has to wonder why a supposed ""heterosexual"" would go to such lengths as to publish anti-gay tirades - the recently documented study showing that homophobia is highly correlated with same-sex repression and self-loathing is my guess. This self-published diatribe contains supposed science that is either incorrect or misconstrued, along with long discredited freudian pseudoscience.The author and his ilk are on the wrong side of history and in a few years will be viewed in the same light as racists and sexists are now. Unfortunately, lives have been and will continue to be lost as long works such as this, reminenscent of the anti-semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion, continue to be sold.Shame on you."
1,Don't waste your money,"Pass on this, the sound is bad, the band is lathargic. Don sounds bored, George's sound while punchy at times, is the only good thing about this. Mick's drums sound like they were recorded in a tin shack, as for Jeff...is he even on this cd.Get Beast From The East instead, try to find the 2-cd import. While that only goes up to 1988, is far better then this and Live From The Sun.Sanctuary should delete this ASAP, and then sould be flogged for putting this bildge on the market, I've got better soundsing bootlegs then this."
2,Not much better than an audience recorded bootleg.,"The sound quality is horrible. The performace is okay, but I've heard better sounding audience recorded bootlegs than the sound on this CD. It sounds like this is a very rough board recording without any post-production. There is also a very noticible hiss in the background. Unless you collect everyting by Dokken, pass on this. ""Beast From The East"" and ""Live From The Sun"" are much better Dokken live CD's."
4,"Great Bootleg, Half the Price",If this were a bootleg you stumbled across at a little record store you'd be stoked out of your mind at the quality and be willing to pay twice the price. It's raw and cheap. Buy it.
2,"nice man, good intentions, but...","...not a very good or convincing---or original---book. Alot of secondary sourcing and none-too-original theorizing. Has a low-budget feel, as well. For the collector in you, if you dare.Vince Palamara"
4,Eye-opening jazz!,"Orrin has a great future ahead of him. The interplay of the musicians, seems they are really listening, moving, responding, giving passionately.I've seen Orrin play live and he's just as exciting, if not more.Buy any recording of his, you won't be disappointed. Has the potential to set the standard....like a Monk or Herbie. Awsome talent."
2,Good product bad supplier,"The poster was good - met expectations. But, the supplier was late in despatching the item and was not good about handling the matter - I had to use Amazon's Guarantee."
1,Did not work for me.,"I would love to say that this product worked wonders for me, but sadly, it did not. I followed all of the directions, but the product did nothing for me. I mean nothing. Since so many people swear by it, I will give this product the benefit of the doubt, and say that it is possible that I may have received an expired product."
4,Great system!,I have used various at home relaxer systems over the years and I must say that this one is by far the best. My hair feels much softer and healthier after each use. One thing I don't like is the build up left by the conditioner contained in this system. My solution: I leave it in for a while (plastic cap for an hour or so and even overnight) but I then do a complete shampoo after rather than just a rinse. My practice is also to always get a professional trim after each relaxer.
5,Excellent,"I suspect the person who rated this product 1 star didn't follow the instructions.This product was my first venture into the world of hair-relaxers, and it turned out much simpler and less caustic than I had anticipated. The instructions that are included are very clear and straight-forward. If you apply the same precaution and common sense as you would in, say, high school chem lab (e.g. use gloves, don't do it near an open flame), I guarantee you'll be fine. Putting Vaseline on your hairline really helps, and have a wet towel on hand so you can wipe any stray globs that land on your face/forehead before they burn you.I'm pretty satisfied with the results. This isn't just for african-american hair. I have curly/wavy and course hair, and when I used to straighten it with an iron, it would always curl up again after I showered. Now it stays relatively straight even after it gets wet. Not only that, it's even shinier now."
4,"LADIES, PLEASE READ THE LABEL ON THE BOX","I've noticed something weird before purchasing this product, the box says 'normal' but if you read the reviews, some descriptions say extra strength. And judging the mixed reviews, I believe some people are getting normal and some extra strength although they are all purchasing the product above. Just an observation. Take care."
2,Oh well I tried.....,I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this relaxer. As a result I had very high hopes. This relaxer was on sale ($3.99) at my local BSS which is another reason why I purchased it. This was my first time self relaxing since I've been on my healthy hair journey and I wanted to be careful not to suffer a setback. My hair didn't shed as much as I anticipated but this relaxer didn't take at all. I have very fine 4b hair and hadn't relaxed in 3 months. I had a good bit of new growth so I used a good amount and even left it on for 16 min. (Whenever I self relaxed before my journey I would rinse out after 12 min bcuz my hair is too fine for that bone str8 look.) I don't know if my hair is just growing more coarse now and I needed to leave it on longer or what but this relaxer really didn't take at all which is something I've never experienced in over 20 years of relaxing.
1,no..,This totally fried my hair. I'm mixed and I have extremely curly hair. I did exactly what the directions said and 'totally fried' is an understatement. Maybe it will work better in your hair? I wouldn't do it though.
3,Great Relaxer,"I must say that when I used this relaxer on my hair it worked wonders. I have naturally curly hair that has turned wavy and this product got my hair pin straight. I only did my roots as doing the whole hair would result in overprocessing of my hair and be completely devistating. My hair was nice and shiny and I was very happy. The product did not sting my roots whatsoever, but I must say that this product has a very strong smell to it that can linger in your house and hair for about 2 days. Another thing is that the product did not last a very long time on my hair. About 2 weeks later my wavyness came back, but than again it could just be my hair. But overall this relaxer worked quite good."
1,The worst hair experience in my life,"Ive been using this relaxer for a while now and couldn understand why i was experiencing a terribly dry itchy scalp. On top of that i also noticed that i was loosing more hair daily than a animal shedding their fur in the spring time! This experience has been traumatic and life altering and i am highly considering filing a claim against the company. If anyone has suffered from a bad experience such as me, please contact me personally via email at Neyshera@yahoo.com"
5,The best relaxer,"I love this perm. I have been using this for the past three years and my hair feels like silk. I used to have a nick name for my hair, the sahara dessert. I no longer have dry hair, it is shiny and well moisturized and looks rich and healthy. I recommended this to my friend and now she is hooked as well. This a great relaxer I don't use anything else on my hair. My local beauty supply sells the kit for six dollars."
5,"awesome, beautiful and even more awesome!!!!","i have very thick hair about shoulder length and i've used relaxers such as mizani-ok, precise-pretty good, bantu-pretty good, and affirm-very good...this relaxer gets my hair just as straight as affirm if not straighter and it leaves my hair feeling soooo soft and healthy looking...i'll never use anything else!"
2,Not for white hair,I had read that I could use this product on my extra curly hair to get it to straighten. But I found out it just dried it out very much. It straightened it for about 2 weeks but it was so dry it felt like hay. DO NOT USE IT IF YOU ARE WHITE NO MATTER WHAT IT SAYS.
1,Relaxer not up to claims.,"After seeing the claims for the Olive Oil Relaxer on Tyra Banks Show, I purchased it. Used it according to the directions, but at the end or the process, when combing with the oil conditioner; hunks of my hair came out in the comb. This happened about 4 times. My hair is now shorter than before. This Relaxer seemed to be worse for me than others I have used, even though it had good conditioners."
5,personal life,"i open my book almost everyday and i keep telling my mom read this read that because it relates so much to my life in so many ways and its just the greatest teen handbook ive seen yet i really recommend this book to anyone who has had a tough childhood with divorce ,and everything that goes with it.I really think that this handbook will really give you a whole other picture on many things you may have to go through during your life. I would definetly let anyone borrow my handbook if they needed help with anything because this would practically answer anything you had in mind. Thanks"
3,A developing author,"I had started Parshall's Resurrection File, and stopped. It just did not flow for me, and the character development was somewhat forced. But Trial By Ordeal had been recommended, so I tried it. It was a much better written book, although it made me uncomfortable with what a mockery of true justice our legal profession in America has become. Like so many Christian novelists, Parshall kind of forces the point in having people accept Christ pretty easily, but I guess there's only so much you can do in the setting of a novel. It's a good read, and I think it shows Parshall is growing as a novelist. I liked it enough that I'm going to check into some of his other books. At least it's a clean read, without sex scenes of profanity."
5,Schiff Move Free Advanced + MSM,"My wife had an operation of one of her knees, everything was OK but always a twinge which was painful. By using the Schiff Move Free Advanced+ MSM has given her painless knees."
2,Good introduction but has many faults,"This book introduces the reader to the AppWizard and ClassWizard. Much of the book focus is on actual windows calls which can leave the novice lost in the code. Chapters are long and subject occasionally goes off on a tangent (see chapter 3). The web site that contains the program listings is not complete. The download database associated with chapter 5 is corrupt.The Active X control used in chapter 3 is not part of the developer studio and must be purchased seperately. The book does familiarize the reader with the Wizards but like most books of this nature, misses the mark when relating to typical dialog-based business applications that are composed primairily with list boxes, grids, edit controls, radio buttons, etc (real world applications)."
2,This is a book that covers limited topics.,"This book sucks. I'm a newbie in VC++. I didn't benefit from this book much after reading it. The example of beam spans into the whole book and it's such a nuisance! So if you are thinking about learning Visual C++ from scratch, don't get this book!"
3,"OK, but not what it claims to be.","A very gentle introduction to the MFC.DOES NOT cover cross-platform development for Mac, or converting from Windows 3.1 to Win32, as claimed on the cover."
5,Excellent alternative to the high priced version,A plus of this book is that the content is Identical to the edition sold in the US. Comparing prices this was a no brainer for content and savings on a college budget.
5,A must read if...,"If you enjoy psychology and like to know the basics of social psychology then this is a must read, I haven't read other social psychology books, but this is a good book. I read it at my first psychology term in Denmark, and it is one of my favorites books at the University so far.Cons: I wish it had another writer on the book so it would present better and less biased examples."
3,"Informative, although too much jargon","I like this book because I think it does a really nice job of incorporating ideas of social psychology with their respectable theorists. However, I would not encourage professors to use this book because it is a bit too broad."
2,Badly written with worse premise,"The idea that a guy, upon merely SEEING a girl, would fly back and forth between Hong Kong and New York just to see her; learn Chinese just to talk to her; all before actually meeting her is ridiculous. Mahoney may try to pass it off as romantic and ""meant to be"" but c'mon, let's get real. On a cop's salary no less? Does he know how much roundtrip tickets to Asia cost?Right away the girl gets killed, and the cop immediately starts referring to her as his fiance. I mean the lovely couple hadn't even discussed it at that point, okay?Furthermore, I find the idea that a cop could find a Chinese airline attendant so enthralling he is going to go through all the things I mentioned above a little racist and insulting.Never finished the book"
2,Not his best,I liked all of Dans books upto this point. To many characters to follow and Cisco should put his retirement papers in.
5,slayer...Slayer...SLAYER!,"This is kind of like having a greatest hits album from one of the best true metal bands in a live format. And, it is totally live without any overdubs whatsoever.Hanneman and King could exell at their solos, even changing them a bit from the studio recordings. Lombardo performs even some of the more technical drumming almost to perfection on this live recording.This is the definitive Slayer album, for both the diehard fan and those curious about the band!"
1,Not as depicted,It is only one episode . A journey not journeys. I got it for a gift for someone who was dissapointed.
3,Drags a Little,"While King Henry VIII of England enjoys wine and sumptuous feasts and all sorts of women, his soldiers are terrorizing the Ireland, raping, pillaging, and burning.Magheen O'Neill is a fiery, spirited Irish princess, granddaughter of the famous warrior Con O'Neill. She is determined to rid her beautiful land of the Sasanach(English invaders).To unite Ireland, Magheen forsakes true love and marries into a powerful Sean-Ghall(foreigners who have accepted the Irish ways) family. This brings her much sorrow, especially when King Henry does his last act of treachery...I thought Magheen was too stereotypical a heroine, a little too perfect. She is drop-dead gorgeous AND smart AND physically fit AND on and on and on. Also, the story dragged, and some parts were rather unrealistic."
5,"A great ""Rhyne quintet""","I think I have become addicted to Rhynes playing. What a great quintet he has gathered for this recording. I like the way Mel Rhyne swings on the second and fourth beat... it s cool.Rhyne has become surprisingly ""bluesy"" nowadays compared to when he played with Wes in the sixties. Eric Alexander take some real nice solos on this CD... he reminds me somewhat of Stanley Turrentine,, perhaps not as fat tone,, but still.....Ryan Kisor plays very much in the ""bebop tradition"" but he does it very good. at times your can hear quite heavy influences from Clifford Brown, particularly on the track ""Wail"" written by Bud Powell. check out Bernsteins solo here as well. This was already one of my favourite records from the very first time I heard it. On the whole a very enjoyable record."
5,"practical advice, ideas you can use - GREAT BOOK!!!","As a small business owner, I'm always looking for information that will help me run my business better. This book has been a goldmine for me!Dale covers every aspect of business, providing ideas, examples, and practical suggestions. His book really made me think. Even better, it provided me with the inspiration and knowledge I needed to take action and make improvements in my business.Dale's down-to-earth style makes this book an easy and fun read for anyone seeking business advice, from the novice to the seasoned pro. Buy this book!"
5,Best elvis cd that I' ve ever listened to . A must to buy.,"I have listened to many of Elvis Presley's CD's . This one is my favorite . On most CD's there are probably three or four songs that I would like, but on this one I love them all. I play it over and over again and never get tired of listening to it. Buy this one you' ll l ove it."
3,"Better off buying 70,s Masters Boxed set ""Walk a mile...''","Not a bad introduction to some of Elvis's classic late 60's & 70's ballads but if you can afford it buy the 70's Masters ""Walk a Mile in my Shoes"" It is excellent, 10 out of 10.Best value Elvis you will ever buy,as all the tracks have been remastered. The tracks on this CD have not."
3,It s ok...,"A good documentary. Nothing I havent seen on the tv already. Not really what I expected, I expected more like a movie than reality documentary which made it almost impossible to watch straight through. Good journalism, not movie material."
5,Great uplifting documentary!,"This documentary follows the travels of a group of young men from Brooklyn who sought to better understand what defines the human experience. They started their journey in New York where they lived in a homeless community during the coldest week of the year. Next, they traveled to Peru where they assisted hospitalized children with special medical needs. Finally, they ventured out of their comfort zone to befriend men and women with HIV/AIDS and patients in a leper colony in Ghana.Everything in this film was true, and the filmmakers really let the beauty of life shine forth, especially by showing their own lives in such a vulnerable way. This story was truly inspirational and reminds us that, no matter how different people may be in culture, religion, or background, they are all human and deserve the love of others. Additionally, the score for this film was excellently suited for the content and really made the experience even more rich. I highly recommend this film!"
3,So close to greatness,"I came to this DVD via the soundtrack from Thomas Bergersen so didn't really know what to expect of it. What I got was beautiful cinematography, incredible characters, some genuinely heart felt sentiments and sage quotes......and two blokes in the middle of it who just shouldn't have been on screen. Had the movie been limited to the former parts, it would have been stunning. It had the potential to be a Koyaanisqatsi for a new generation. But the surf nonsense, the two Jackass Lite kids travelling the world and attempting to come out with deep quotes (and I say attempting), and then failing to get across any of their experiences, in a way the other people on the film manage so well, just drags the whole affair down too much. It's worth watching, but I'm not sure where the 30 awards came from. It's just not THAT good."
2,Terrible. What a waste of a good title.,"Two stars because it did have some meaningful quotes from some smart people regarding the subject.Other than that this was crap. Let's all follow the well groomed backstreet boys as they wonder around the planet. I am not sure if you could hand pick two more worse examples of humans to lead us on this journey. This bordered on exploitation at points. They spent equal time showing footage that could have been meaningful intertwined with them surfing, posing, and crying about there Mommy's when there was actual real suffering going on in the background. Pathetic. My favorite quote - ""My second grade teacher said I wouldn't amount to anything - hey check this out lady I am in Ghana - how do you like me now?"" The perfect example of the Arrogance Experience that these two complete jerks troll throughout this whole ""documentary"".I could go on and on. Point is don't waste your time or money."
3,Lose the Keyboards!!!,"I bought this album a while back because Turn up the Radio is a great 80's anthem and I figured there should be other great songs on the record. I listened to the first 2 songs ""Send Her to Me"" and ""Turn Up the Radio"" and I was blown away! All of a sudden the keyboards started! I thought I was listening to a Europe album! Keyboards have no place in hard rock/heavy metal unless it is a ballad. If Autograph lost their keyboard player they would've been a better band! As long there is a keyboardist, Autograph should not be named as a band in hard rock! They should tour with Journey and REO Speedwagon not Ratt, Whitesnake and other band of that genre!"
2,Sign Out Please,"I bought this album recently and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I guess I was expecting some sort of hidden 80's Metal gem, due in part to the cool, metal-like album cover. The thing is, I don't think it qualifies as metal at all. The band sounds like your typical early 80's AOR. They sound more like Lover Boy than Motley Crue or Def Leppard. Also, some of the music (especially the synthesizers) sounds cheap and fake, like it was the soundtrack to a low budget 80's teen beach movie. You know what I'm talking about. Having said all that, 'Turn Up The Radio' is still a really good rock single with genuine 80's nostalgia value. The thing is, you can find this track on almost any ""best of 80's metal"" CD. I suggest going that route."
2,For Retro 80's Parties Only!!,"Don't take it too seriously......because it sure ain't a serious album. It is, however, good for some laughs, though I can't fault the ultra-anthemic ""Turn Up the Radio,"" nor the whizzing keyboard work on ""Cloud 10,"" nor some of the backing vocals that carry a majority of these silly songs. With such inane titles as ""Send Her to Me,"" ""Nighteen and Non-Stop,"" and ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend Isn't Me,"" this album is the perfect party album - FOR GEEKS ONLY!! While Autograph give props to ""THE MIGHTY VAN HALEN"" on their dorky back jacket cover, it's actually the influence of the mightier DEF LEPPARD who fattened Autograph's bankroll for about a year in the mid 1980's. Such blatant ripping off was eventually seen through, and these guys haven't been heard from since. Trust me, music fans, these guys made Poison look like Led Zeppelin."
5,NAME RECOGNITION,"ESPECIALLY IN THE '80'S IT SEEMS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT MOTLY CRUE, RATT, OZZY, OR DOKKEN YOU HAD ONE SHOT AT PUTTING A SONG OUT. THESE GUYS GOT THEIR ONE SONG OUT, REMEMBER ""TURN UP THE RADIO"". GREAT SONG. IF YOU LIKED THAT ONE BUY THE ALBUM. IT'S THE BEST 5 STAR YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF. ""SEND HER TO ME"" REMAINS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES. ""ALL I'M GONNA TAKE"" AND ""CLOUD 10"" ARE GOOD SONGS. ""MY GIRLFREIND'S BOYFREIND IS'NT ME"" IS A CUTE ONE. THE MUSIC SEEMS ABOUT AVERAGE. NOTHING REALLY JUMPS OUT AT YOU BUT THE BACKING VOCALS ARE GREAT, MUSIC HAS GOOD RHYTHEM AND BEAT, AND ALTHOUGH THE LEAD SINGER HAS A VERY RASPY, AND SCRATCHY VOICE, I LIKE HIM. IT GROWS ON YOU."
2,John Fisher's Magic Book,"Do not let the simplicity of the pictures and some ""too easy tricks"" deceive you. I found a great deal of enrrichement from this Magic Book. However you have to go deep into researshing and getting your objective. An expert cardician and a couple of magic tricks from this book can be a very powerful combination"
5,Absolutely life changing,"A mental wreck after working in an ER around the clock, this book and The Healing Codes were instrumental in giving me the knowledge, peace, and calm that I sought. Absolutely everyone should read this book, regardless of faith.Skeptical? We humans are spiritual beings, we recognize truth innately when we're presented with it. Cayce also speaks about findings such as the Biminy Wall that the author is obviously confused about (and she should be, it wasn't discovered until 8 years after this book was written, and 20 years after Cayce's death!)"
3,Tough act to follow,"I liked the book well enough, but I think Cerminara added too much of her own thoughts on the subject of reincarnation, almost reshaping the message Cayce brought to us through his ""channeling"". I would have liked to have read more of Cayce's words and less of Cerminara's ""interpretations"" of Cayce's readings."
5,A Thought Provoking Book!,"I have read 11 ""Edgar Cayce"" books, but ""Many Mansions"" is the MOST thought provoking book of them all! It'll make you think twice before harming anyone. It'll make you think about your own lfe, and why people suffer in different ways, and the whole purpose of life in general. This is DEFINATELY a MUST READ!"
5,A lovingly wrought tale,"Just as Walt Whitman tended to wounded soldiers during the Civil War, author Roy Morris has tended to this sad and moving story. What could have been mere history becomes much more, touched with tender tales, eloquence, and sadness. Morris deftly weaves Whitman's Civil War poetry into the narrative but also adds his own well-wrought phrases to make a highly readable and compelling book. Those who know Whitman will come away thankful for this fuller exegesis of just a few years in his life. Those who don't know Whitman will marvel at the man and perhaps even begin their own long career of reading him. ""The Better Angel"" now goes on my shelf next to Justin Kaplan's Whitman bio, one to be savored, one for the ages."
2,A major disappointment,"This is a dull book. It's written in a hip, quickspeak, that is too oblique to grab you. It's like reading Derek Taylor's memoir of his time with the Beatles, where he tries so hard to sound hip-literary, he completely buries what he's writing about. Oldham was intimate with the Stones. He's a witty guy in interviews. This is a fat book, but very little in it that's intereting. After I bought it, I read it once, skimming a lot of it, and donated it to the library. It does obliquely confirm that he and Jagger had a gay affair. In the bio JAGGER UNAUTHORIZED, that author makes the claim that Oldham and Jagger slept together. In Stoned, Oldham says, ""Me and Mick got as close as two men can possibly get,"" which to me confirmed the rumor. And Oldham set Keith up with his girl friend, as Oldham thought, ""Keith should go out with something other than his guitar."" That's about all of interest about the Stones in this book. It's as disappointig as Peter O'Toole's memoirs."
1,Not so sure,I had a real hard time getting by the first two chapters. Cant comment beyond that. Left it at my brothers place in Denver... oh well...
2,For completists only,"Some interesting facts tossed ala salad with other excerpts and interviews. I learned a little of Oldham's personality and thoughts, but history is far more interesting in many other books. You won't waste your time with this book, but it probably won't excite you much. Not much else to say."
4,Carlos the Terrorist,"if you are a fan of great acting, drama, espionage and political duplicity, then this is the dvd for you. I am old enough to remember when Carlos was wreaking his misguided terrorism around the world. Politics and duplicity on a global scale and how is criminal activities were funded by governments in the middle east. The acting and intrigue are first rate. My only problem with this dvd is that it is the story of the adult Carlos. I wish there would have a bit more on what formed his degenerate, view of the world given his upper middle-class upbringing in Venezuela."
3,Great film but inadequate subtitles,"This is a long film but extremely good. It contains many languages but subtitles are only supplied for the non-English dialogue. This is a very serious shortcoming as the accents are very heavy, hard enough for native speakers and hopeless for the hard of hearing and the tens of millions to whom English is a second language. I am waiting to see if the coming Criterion releae rectifies this and suggest others do the same."
4,And I thought she was just the wife of a great leader...,"After reading this book, my respect for the great leader Dr. King, as well as his phenomenal wife grew. I never knew she was a such a success story apart from Dr. King. I also admire her for literally laying down her life to be a support to her husband. The courage she demonstrated encouraged me so. I am also the wife of a Black Baptist preacher and I now know that there are no limits for me and any strong Black male leader must have a strong Black woman standing behind him."
2,I don t like it,"I did not like the product, lacking in content products is incomplete 1 - lacking two poster 2 - missing a pumpkin sticker bondabledetail original product content:HELLOWEEN Pumpkin Box (1998 Japanese-only 40-track promo sample 4-CD box set Comprising three picture CD albums featuring rare B-sides, live tracks and early, plus a fourth disc of special interview material, housed in a promo stickered book-style sleeve complete with 4 ""square pumpkin sticker, 70-page 6"" x 10 ""deluxe color booklet packed with photographs plus chronology"
1,Moronic doesn't begin to cover it,"What plodded along as a tedious, self-absorbed study in navel gazing turned abruptly imbecilic with the suicide of a young boy named Hercule, whom I'm supposed to believe would shoot himself with a rifle when told he couldn't see ""the neighbor girl."" If you give any sort of credence or praise to this movie, you are a moron. If you would allow your children to watch this and not address the ridiculousness of this premise, you are a moron -- and your children will become morons. I can't begin to describe how vile this depiction is -- how trivializing of a serious subject on the one hand, and on the other hand how bereft of intellect this ""plot turn."" Deserves about 500 negative stars; unbelievable anyone would put a penny toward producing such utter dreck."
4,the 2000 dog show guide,"Very helpful! I have been showing dogs for years and and this book is much more accurate than the ""calendar"". I love the fact that it has specialties!"
4,Static on recording,"I would like to buy this CD, but the samples I listened to did not seem very clear - there was a lot of skipping and static in the background. So I will have to pass."
3,Just an ok product... loses it's attraction quickly,"Mostly this is a great toy to ""try to fool""... the fun of the toy wears off quickly. I think perhaps that after one year the item was donated to a better cause. Don't waste your time and money unless it is dirt cheap!"
2,Mediocre at best,"Failed to guess ""particle accelerator,"" ""atom,"" ""bomb,"" ""matches,"" and even ""unicorn."" What a waste. If you come up with your mundane, everyday articles of daily living, then it's possibly accurate about 60% of the time (at least by my estimates). But otherwise, avoid it. It fails to measure up."
4,It is what it is,"Read all the reviews of people who obviously thought this was an industrial weight step stool. Let's be clear--it is the old fashioned stool for home kitchens---small, lightweight but servicable. And I like the size as it sits in a corner of my kitchen. A bit of a puzzle to put together but not anything a reasonably agile human would find impossible. You can perch on the seat---don't expect to make yourself comfortable but think of it as a kitchen stool---not a full sized dining chair and you won't be disappointed. As I have cupboards that go all the way to my ceiling---it is a great thing to have to reach those top storage shelves."
1,VERY poor construction,Do not bother buying this piece of junk. It appears to be poorly made of pot metal and plastic and is so cheaply constructed that it cannot be properly put together. It is just awful. If I could have rated it minus 5 stars I would have done so.
2,Big let down,I was so excited to recieve this then was very disappointedIi remembered the one my Grandma had and this is a very poor replica Very cheaply made!!
1,Not a great chair,The seat is too small and the steps won't stay in place. Stay away from this purchase. You will be wasting your money.
1,Piece of junk,"This chair looks so good on the site; however, when I attempted to put it together, the base underneath the seat is plastic and the screws didn't get it secure enough to even attempt to sit on. It's this flimsy plastic to be adhered to metal. It just doesn't work.It's easy to see why it's so cheap. Please don't waste your money. I sent it back the next day I received it"
1,Do NOT buy this!!!,I purchased this step stool and regret wasting my money. This is cheaply made and takes a long time to assemble. The step chair moves out of place when you move the chair - I hesitate to put my full weight on the chair. I would not buy this again or recommend this to a friend. I suggest spending more money on a chair that is better made!
1,Bo-Razz-Hiss,"Not a very good product...Kinda cheap, hard to put togeather, and does not work well...I was thinking that was pretty cheap to be too good. I was right, but I will live withit...I am too cheap to go out and put out enough to get a good one..."
5,Gift for a friend,My friend just loves this chair. It is sturdy and she is comfortable climbing up to top shelves in kitchen.
4,Red Kitchen step stool,"I was very pleased with the Cosco Red, Retro Chair /Step Stool. The size is perfect for my kitchen and is exactly what I wanted and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I'm so glad I finally found the stool I've been looking for a few years and finally found it in Amazon.Cosco 11120RED1 Retro Chair/Step Stool, Red"
2,assembly from hell,This chair was delivered in good condition and on time. The assembly directions were very difficult to follow. I consider myself very good at assembling most anything. The bracket for stabilizing the chair was drilled incorrectly and would only fit by screwing it at a strange angle.Love the chair but was a nightmare to put together.
3,Nice addition to my kitchen/dining,I was given this stool as a gift (fully assembled). It is quite heavy so it is not something I would use as a utility chair. On the other hand It's weight and sturdiness are perfect to allow my 2 year old son to help me in the kitchen then pull him to the dining room table for dinner (I actually got rid of our highchair.) SO if you have a purpose and need for it - then go for it - otherwise find something else. Oh the way the stairs retracted is of poor design - but they work.
2,"cosco""s chair/step stool",I was thrilled to find these stools just want I've been looking for.When putting them together I was very diappointed to find the seat cushion was so thin and the underside attached to the legs have plastic. Not sure how long this will hold together.
2,Cosco Retro Chair,The Cosco Retro Chair is not what I thought. CHEAP CHEAP. I hope it will at least last a year. Waste of money!!
3,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in the Cosco Red Retro Chair/Step Stool. Cheaply made, not real reliable as a step stool, would discourage it. Not sturdy enough to use as a step stool for anyone. Nice decorative addition to the home. Would only use for just a chair to sit on mostly."
2,Cosco puts the Ass in Assembly!,"Most of the assembly components on this stool are absolute crap. The brackets don't line up, even though I followed the instructions to the letter, facing the arrows in the correct direction. And the track which allows the stool to slide forward and back is cheap, flimsy plastic; and again, had the assembly holes molded in the wrong location to line up with the matching brackets.I got it put together as best as I could; but it was extremely wobbly and lopsided, thanks to the unbalanced brackets. And the steps are teeny tiny! My 20-month-old son had a hard time balancing himself on the bottom one, which stinks since we bought it for him as a big boy chair.I disassembled it as best as I could (since I stripped the screws, trying to force them into the asymmetrical holes), and sent it back to Amazon. At least they have a generous return policy, and arranged a prepaid UPS pickup for the rebound shipping."
4,Cosco Step Stool/Chair,"I purchased this as a replacement for one my husband trash picked several years ago and never repaired or refurbished. I was a little disappointed that the bottom steps were not hinged, but merely slide out when needed. The instructions were easy to follow and the item seems to be sturdy."
2,Not what it seems,"I selected this chair over the white chair/step stool, also offered through Target, because it looked sturdier. However, the parts are so poorly constructed that they do not fit together well, and there is a significant wobble to the legs. The sliding mechanism for the steps is primitive and constantly derails. I bought this stool as a perch for my 2-year old daughter to watch me work in the kitchen, but it is so unstable that I am afraid to let her climb on it.Also, while the assembly instructions are easy to follow, either the screws and/or the accompanying Allen wrench are too flimsy. I could not tighten the screws properly before the wrench was completely stripped."
5,just like grandma's....,"This was purchased for my sister as her Christmas gift (it was what she asked for) .... I really thought I was going to have to go scrounging around thrift shops to find one, but decided to do an internet search first...several online stores had them but Amazon was the company that I knew would get it to me in time for Christmas. And they did and she LOVED it!"
3,Dissapointed.,I was hoping for this stool to have been at least as sturdy as the originals. Not even close. The pull out steps slide on cheap plastic grooves that wobble and don't really line up properly and fall out when you lift the stool up. This is cost cutting gone wrone. Just a cheap piece of junk. I will hunt down a vintage stool so that I'm not afraid to actually stand on it.
2,Quite disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this chair. The advertisement said it was a replica of the 50's, but it clearly is not.It is much, much smaller and made of poor quality plastic. The 'steps' are seated in a flimsy plastic rail that does not hold together when the chair is moved. Very poor quality and very deceptive advertising."
2,Would return if it weren't a gift..,"This thing is kind of a piece of junk. I will say the stool part is okay, but the part that counts- the steps, falls completely out of the crappy plastic tracks anytime I so much as nudge this thing. I got it as a gift, so I might as well keep it, but I'd never buy it. Save your money."
2,RETRO CHAIR ISN'T MADE AS WELL AS THE 1960'S CHAIR!,"I paid $50 for this chair (including shipping) from Amazon. I was disappointed after putting it together. Comparing it to the REAL retro chair I still have from the 60's/70's, the advertised chair has a smaller seating area and the plastic components are alot cheaper feeling. The step stool portion SLIDES out and has too much ""jiggle"" when pulling it out in the plastic tracks. The old-school one is more sturdy and you had to lift and swing it on hinges and bring it forward and down. The old one feels much more sturdier. It's ""olive-colored old tupperware looking green"", that's why I thought I buy this nice red one, but the quality (same COSCO manufacturer almost 50 years later) has gone down. Don't expect too much if you are going to buy it. It's RETRO-looking, but not RETRO-quality."
5,Very cute!!,"I have looked everywhere for one of these except vintage like my Granny and Grandpa used to have in their kitchen when I was a kid. My mom found one in an antique store last year but I can't seem to find one. I have a 2 year old grandson that likes to help cook =) I settled on this one until I can find the ""One"" lol but I love this one too! Be careful putting it together as I had to dismantle the thing twice but it really is a great product!"
2,"Cosco 11120 Red 1 Retro chair/Step Stool, Red",Poor quality. The screws were not the right fittings. It wasstruggle putting it together. It is not very strong to climbup on ~ not the quality I thought it would be.
3,Grandkids love this stool!,This stool is just what I wanted. The grandkids love it especially my youngest who can stand up to counter close enough without fear of falling. the older ones like to sit on it up to the table.
2,Damaged,"I recieved this product, and upon unpacking, discovered damage due to poor packing of product. I immediately called and part was on back order. As of 2/4/13 it is still on B.O. To me, for a simple and popular item such as this to have parts on B.O. this long is unacceptable."
3,It's more of a novelty item!,This will provide the service I was looking for in my kitchen (sitting and stepping)....but I was very surprised at how small it actually is. If you are wanting a reproduction chair relative in size of the stools back in the 50s this isn't it! But it will do.
3,Not like Grandma's,"I loved my grandma's step stool, but this one doesn't hold a candle grandma's. It's cute, pretty easy to put together but is not as sturdy due to some parts being plastic. You can feel the screws coming through to the seat. It is perfect for my grand kids. I got it for me due to me not being able to stand for long periods in the kitchen cooking but as it turned out it's not strudy enought for me. The red does add an additional pop to my kitchen decor."
4,It's not the original but it's still very cute!,"My mother had admired a retro stool like this at a store recently and mentioned that one like it had been in her mother's kitchen when she was a girl.Despite some bad reviews on Amazon I went ahead and ordered it for her. Well, she loves it and I'm pleased with it as well. She agreed that it's not the really heavy chrome seat of her childhood but she also said that if it was we probably couldn't have afforded it!She likes it because her grandchildren can use it at the kitchen table to sit on and then the stool part helps her reach those high shelves in the kitchen. Plus it's really cute!Oh, and I didn't have any issues with assembly. It went together in about 20 minutes and none of the parts seemed cheap or flimsy. So far so good!NOTE: If you are simply looking for a hard working step ladder to use around the house, I wouldn't buy this one. It works fine but is really for lighter duty work like occassionally reaching for dishes too high, etc."
3,retro,"Looks like a stool chair combination my Aunt had when I was growing up and I always loved hers. So, that's why I purchased this one for my husband for Valentine's day. He likes to cook and uses the stool to sit at the kitchen counter to chop up his ingredients, etc. Really nice."
2,Not At All Like The Original,"If you're hoping for a stool that has the same quality as the original, this isn't it. The vinyl is very thin plastic, the metal leg braces are thin metal stampings. In general it was a very cheap imitation of the original product of the 50's/60's. I returned mine and will keep looking for an old used original Cosco product that was made in the U.S.A."
3,Somewhat dissappointed,"Since I purchased this item it came on sale at our local Big R store for $29.99 and I feel like I was cheated, because I paid $49.99 from you"
1,Unsafe at any size,"A kitchen step stool must be safe. This one is not. The top step, the one that must be used, since we are cautioned not to step on the seat, is very small and is made even smaller by the fact that it does not fully pull clear from the seat. Thus, only the toes can be put on the step. For one of normal size this is dangerous; for an elderly person it is lethal. I have requested the US Consumer Protection agency to recall this stool. Beyond this important concern, the product is cheaply made, plastic - which is never stronger than steel in such products - is used in critical areas and will never well or sufficiently support its functions."
1,This product stinks!,"My grandmother had one of these stools years ago. There is no comparison between this new piece of crap, and the old ones from the 1960s. This new one was hard to assemble, cheaply/poorly made, and the steps do not fold out properly. But, the most importnat drawback - I would not dare put more than 20 pounds on either step. What a rip-off!"
1,nothing like the old ones,"i ordered 3 of these chairs. put the first one together, didn't even open the other 2. it was not nearly as sturdy as at my grandma's. it also had something sharp poking through the back rest. returned all three."
4,Great for light use!,"The complaints bout the wobbly steps are accurate, but its a great light chair for my laundry/utility room. Best for singles, or light and middle weight adults, I wouldn't get it if you've got small kids."
4,Good but not perfect,Some of the screws would not fit into the spaces provided. A little hard to put together. Hit does look good and does solve the problem in the kitchen. I do recommend it.
5,"Retro Chair/Stepstool, Red","I found the perfect Christmas gift for my 4 daughters, right here on Amazon.com!!! This retro chair/stepstool is virtually the same one that the girls ""fought over"" at Grandma's every visit. They had to take turns sitting on this stool at mealtime. Christmas morning this year, I lined the wrapped boxes up across the living room floor, and the girls had to open their gifts at the same time. All of them were transported back to Grandma's house instantly! I am very impressed with the quality of the chairs. The price cannot be beat. I watched someone put one of the chairs together - it was no trouble and used only one tool (Phillips screwdriver). It may have taken 20 minutes total to put the chair together. I can only hope that my daughters' grandkids will fight over who gets to sit on Grandma's red stool!"
2,"Cute product, BAD QUALITY!","Long Story Short,Very poor production quality, cheap parts, following instructions still leaves to rickety chair/let alone stool. Very unpleased by the outcome. Last Cosco item we purchase. Made in China = Trash. Suggestion, don't buy!"
2,Too small.,"I felt the chair/step stool was a good color, but was too small and I felt not sturdy enough for an adult. I do not feel safe getting on it."
2,Disappointed to say the least.,"I have owned the older version of the Cosco Chair/Step stool and it was FAR superior to the new one. This new version looks good but it is poor quality, wobbles and does not stay together (the steps fall out of position). The older ones were terrific. Save your money and look for an old one."
1,Purchase only if you have several hours to devote to setting it up.,"Screws did not fit in the pre-drilled holes. Luckily I had the proper sizes in my tool kit. The seat is put together, but after 4 hours I have put it aside and will tackle the steps at another time. I wish that I had gone out and purchased one that was already assembled. I am out of the money, and I still do not have a kitchen stool! It's too heavy to think about returning, and like most people, I had to totally tear up the packaging to get it out of the box. It can't be returned. So, there it sits, over in the corner! I ran out of screws that would fit the holes but I have the ones that came with the stool. Maybe I will find a use for them You will get 4 screws and 12 bolts.Have your 16 screws ready before you begin. Save the 24 bolts for another job"
1,Junk,"This is definitely NOT the chair you may remember. I just returned mine and I return VERY few items. Many, many cheap plastic parts, holes do not align properly, very difficult to assemble, requires offset or 'stubby' screwdriver. Screw heads strip easily. Not sturdy. Really disappointed."
3,Cosco 11120 Red 1 Retro Chair/Step Stool Red,I have received this item. The description says little to put together. This whole item comes shipped in pieces with a booklet telling you how to put it together. I have had to ask my brother to come over and help me as there are so many pieces. Hopefully it will all be good.
2,Love the older model of this chair,"I ordered this chair for my son because I had so many great memories growing up and using this chair.The quality is not what it used to be. The step is not sturdy like my parents' model. The chair overall doesn't seem sturdy and stable like the older models.For the price of this chair, I expected more. However, since there aren't any other options out there, this newer-less-than-desirable model is our only choice if we want a chair with steps for little kids to be able to use."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this chair/stool for my wife for Christmas, after an extended assembly, the item will serve it's intended purpose, but very disappointed in quality, the backrest & seat have areas that are completely worn thru the covering in shipping, poorly packed for transit from CHINA.. would not recommend this product to any one and will think twice about further purchases online..Cosco 11120RED1 Retro Chair/Step Stool, Red"
3,cute,It seems a little chincy. I wish it folded like the vintage ones but it'll do the trick. They tell me i have to qrite more for the review.
3,needs improvement,This is a nice stool but it has no safety lock for the steps - could be dangerous for anyone. Not made like the old ones.
5,Easy to put together,Chair easy to put together. Some other reviews noted that the steps stick when pulling out but that was solved by placing white lithium grease on the slides. Great Item
4,Comfy kitchen chair,"This is a very comfortable kitchen chair, but the only complaint that I have are the steps. They have a tendency to come off their guides when the chair is lifted upright. Other than that, I find this chair great for kitchen chores that keep you on your feet. I just had major surgery, but this chair seems solid and safe so I don't have to constantly stand on my feet. I highly recommend this chair for the slicing, dicing and chopping chores that come with cooking."
4,Very cute and functional,"I get so many compliments on this little stool! I love the look, and it was relatively easy to assemble (took less than an hour). I have two minor complaints. One, it is a pretty small seat. Which in some ways, is good, so it doesn't take up too much space, but in other ways, it's just a little small for someone to sit on. Second, the pull out step stool is hardly useful. The top step is so small, I wouldn't recommend standing on it. However...all in all, I recommend it."
3,Cosco Chair/step,This small chair/step stool is more than suitable for the small location that I live in.I was aware of the negative limitations offered by the various blogs but it is perfect for our use.
4,Retro Stool Functional,"I like the look and functionality of this product.It's well designed,just like grandma's! The step stool slider tracks are plastic and the seat and back are vinyl.Easy to assemble and would have gotten 5 stars from me, IF the seat,back and sliders were made of steel like grandma's!"
2,Flimsy,Not well made. We put it together very well but some of the washers were too small and we had to obtain others.Stairs are too narrow and brackets are not strong. I have decided that I will use it for a potted plant!
1,Piece of junk!,"I was excited about this purchase for my kitchen. But, it was very small and the screws began falling out day one. Definitely not a good buy!"
2,retro chair,"I was very disappointed in the size of the chair. It is really small. It is countertop height, but really small. It is not sturdy enough to use as a step stool. It is however just the right size for my 5 year old granddaughter to sit at the table. So maybe,,,a highchair instead of a step stool should be the ad. It is pretty, just like the picture,,just too small and not sturdy enough."
2,assembly,The person I sent this to as a gift found the assembly very time consuming anddifficult. I would not have purchased it if I knew the chair was not alreadyassembled.
5,Excellent and long lasting!,"My sons (16 and 18) enjoyed this as children. It helped them learn cadence and language. The word choice helped improve their vocabulary (how many 4 year olds know what vacuous means?) and the subject of dinosaurs captured their attention. But more, they loved it enough that it is a childhood book that was never given away, and now that they have younger cousins, and second and third cousins, etc. they thought to buy this for them and have read to them with the joy of sharing and introducing the smaller children to a well-loved old friend."
1,Tyrannosaurus Was a Beast,"""...Allosaurus liked to hunt,and when it caught its quarry,it tore it open,back and front,and never said,"" I'm sorry!"" Allosaurus liked to eat,and using teeth and talons,it stuffed itself with tons of meat,and guzzled blood by gallons."" If you think your child does not see enough violence on TV then you should buy this book!"
3,A Common Formula For This Type of Film,"Empress and the Warriors is a decent movie but won't be the best you will see in this genre. As with most movies of this type, there seems to be a common formula in which the ingredients are warring clans, a loyal lieutenant, a back-stabbing villain, and a pretty princess. Mix the ingredients well and then add in great action scenes, a love interest, and the death of a central character. What you get is ""Empress and the Warriors"" as well as most other movies of this type!That's not to say that I did not like the story, it's just to say that it was quite predictable as I've seen it told many times before. What kept me glued to film were the battle scenes and the hope it would end differently than I expected!"
4,Empress & The Warriors,"I enjoyed watching this particular movie so much due to action scenes.The sword play fighting scenes was at time, very well play out to say the least. In most martial arts films."
5,An Empress and the Warriors - Blu Ray version,"An Empress and the Warriors Blu Ray disc arrived earlier than promised,and in excellent condition. All the product description for this disc was veryaccurate, this is important information that I count on before I make a purchase.The disc played without a hitch. The color and sharpness of this movie great, itlives up to the Blu Ray standards. I really enjoy the movie as well, nice story andlots of action. If you are a Donnie Yen FAN, you should get this."
3,Disappointed,"Another movie where Donnie is sold as the lead actor, but he's not part of the courtship of the princess and doesn't even play a convincing role as the lead male actor.I pretty much think that Donnie is a fighter trying to be an actor just like Howard Stern says Jackie Chan is a stunt man trying to be an actor.Donnie needs to exert more control over the direction of movies he plays in, and not just the action, but the story line also."
3,Not so good,The movie starts off with a decent premise but slowly turns sour. It goes from a war of kingdoms movie to a love story that never turns into anything. The plot doesn't really thicken it just stays flat and at most points in time it is just hard to keep watching. If you want to see a love story where a women decides between two men and one never really puts up a fight and she never really seems interested in that one then this is your movie. If not find a better Chinese dynasty film.
5,"Nice quality, good story","Sad Chinese movie (yet again) but still good. Also, Does not have much hand to hand fights - this flows more like an epic"
2,Boring,"This is another womens right movie I believe. The movie just doesn""t make much sense. The whole story stinks & is boring."
3,An Empress and the Warrior Blu-ray,"Got fooled by the casting and the title. Thought it was a story of the warring states in ancient China. It was just a story about a fictional princess even. A let down even with Donnie Yen. Still, will order through Amazon again."
2,A movie about a man that losses his girl.,Poor Donnie Yen spent years wooing the princess and she forgets about him in 3 days and falls in love with a random guy she met in the woods. She even decided to leave her throne and her kingdom for this one single man she really doesn't know much about. This is all tied together with a Disneyland war is bad theme. Not what I was expecting to watch. If anything it just shows why women shouldn't be in positions of power because they are lead by their emotions over logic. Hard to say the truth but that's really the only message this movie tells. The princess is more interested in her love life than protecting the Kingdom and her people. If I were alive back than I'd move out her kingdom A.S.A.P. before we get conquered. So So movie 2 stars for having Donnie Yen and -3 stars for him not doing any Kung fu moves.
2,VERY HIGH QUALITY BOOTLEG!!!,"I do not know why people review the movie, I'm not going to review the movie, because I'm pretty sure you know what it's about, why else would you click on it right?So anyways, yes it is a bootleg, a very high quality one though. Most of the time the ones I see are in a plastic sleeve, but this one had the dvd cover and it was sealed, and had the security sticker on the top like most real dvds. But what made me know it was a bootleg is the front cover. Very cheaply done, its just a cut out of Donnie Yen placed in an action scene background. The the word warrior was suppose to be plural but it wasn't. The movie itself had some pixelation and the subtitles I got to give it to them, fairly well done, I've seen worst. I can't believe I purchased it. You never pay twelve bucks for a single dvd bootleg, no matter how high quality it is."
3,hybrid fu,"Chick flick period drama with a lame historical pretext. Nice costuming, good background, and enough fu to tease the boys, but not satisfy. A beautiful girl willing to abandon ancestry and practicality for love, unsustainable true love. All around her must suffer until she finally stands at the end, where she should have stood at the beginning. Fluff it, there's some comfort here."
1,"Amazing ""caves""..seriously?","WOW! What a HUGE disappointment. I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my husband who is a caver and this movie was NOTHING about AMAZING CAVES! It was more suitable for my five year old son than my husband and it was quite possibly the biggest waste of time and money. We actually could not even make it through the movie and turned it off! The fact that I am even writing this review must say how dissatisfied I was, because I never write reviews!"
3,"Beautiful imagery, dull narration","There was clearly a lot of time and money put into filming this, and it really shows in the great shots. Ice caves in Greenland -- wow! Yucatan cave diving -- incredible! But the narration is pretty much grade school level. You won't learn a whole lot except that caves may provide materials for new medecines, a point that is repeated over and over and over without any elaboration."
4,An interesting look at caves,The high def is somewhat of a letdown though - it seems very grainy and not nearly as good as some of the more recent blu-ray releases.
2,"Too much music, not enough caves","Two stars, because:- The music by The Moody Blues is intrusive. It's everywhere, all the time, telling you how to feel and what to think. It's like watching the movie with someone who won't shut up. I tried finding an additional soundtrack without the music, or maybe with the music toned down a bit, but no such luck. If I'm ever going to see this film again, it'll have to be with the volume off.- One of the climbers is incessantly repeating that they're doing this because it might lead to the cure for some disease. Just in case we thought they were crazy adventurers and not scientists. You even get the obligatory shot of a scientist doing scientific things inside a laboratory. I want CAVES! I don't care why they do it, I won't judge...- There aren't nearly enough caves."
3,i think i saw a cave!,"most of this movie was a search for extremophilesthere were more flyby mountain scenes, kayaking scenes, scenes of second graders than actual scenes of cavesthe cave diving segment was pretty cool; thats why i gave it 3 stars not 2if want to see something with lots of insides of caves this is not for you"
1,No or little cave scenery,"This video was a disappointment. I purchased the video to see beautiful cave scenery, not someone hanging off the side of a mountain. The focus should have been on the caves and the scenery within, NOT on the people making the video. The title was very misleading, plus one disk, you have to play on a computer which I did not know at time of purchase. I though I was buying a DVD video with two disk (must check product description closely). Wish I could return it for a refund."
3,Poor subject for IMAX format,"I normally like the McGillivray-Freeman IMAX films, but I have to say that this one is the worst I have seen from that company. The subject matter was not very interesting and most of the shots are either close-up or small area shots which make poor use of the IMAX format. The best sequence in the film was flying through parts of the Grand Canyon. This film has none of the interest or drama such as the IMAX film Dolphins has, nor did it have the spectacular area shots which make the most of the IMAX format such as Everest has. All in all, a mediocre effort from a usually winning team (McGillivray-Freeman)."
4,"Wonderful characters, in a brilliant setting","Dick's non-sci-fi novels never get the credit they deserve, some people don't even realize there are such books. The one thing common across all of Dick's writing, is the deep and successful characters. Between a feeling of frustration, love, and hate...all this can be brought out by identifying with the characters.The story takes place in China 1949, but much of the story is told through flashbacks, it is here where you learn how the three characters end up in China in the first place. The story parallels that of the Garden of Eden, where Carl is the innocent Adam/Eve character.While it's not Dick's best work, it's certainly can be placed next to them."
3,Classic Kaurismäki but poor transfers,I have two of these films in the Finnish releases which I was surprised to find have much better picture quality. The stories are classic Kaurismäki and show Finland in the bad old days of the seventies with astonishing clarity. Erinomainen! No Finn will use two words if one will do and Kaurismäki is the master of this characteristic. Beautiful and touching insights into a time and culture far removed from most of the rest of us. Only the Russians might identify with some of this but of course they have been linked for many centuries. Great film making but a pity the discs are not a bit better.
5,Incredible.,"Life is a fickle thing, and what we do with it is the beauty. This flick is an emotional roller coaster, from start to finish. Something primal gets touched deep within as you view.. something hard and true and deep gets touched.. and then you understand the magic.. the beauty.. the incredible similarities. Then you get taken in, gripped tightly in the passion, the passion in the desert."
2,THICK posts,"The earrings are nice & a great value at $30. However, the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore. The posts are not the typical size one might find in US stores. The posts are more typical of earrings that I have purchased in Central & Southern America; in fact, this is where the earrings were made. I returned them."
1,Thick Posts Caveat!,"Unless your piercings are stretched from wearing heavy earrings, you may find these wide, flat posts too thick to pass through your ear lobes! One of my lobes had a pierced hole too small, although I have no problem wearing other earrings and studs. With my other ear, the earring post went through with no problem, however, it was heavy enough to give the hole a slit look. The earrings were well made, felt solid, not hollow and the price was good, but, they were not designed for me and were returned."
2,Ehh,Disappointed in the size and thickness of the earrings though its probably my fault since the description is accurate. I was hoping they'd be bigger
4,aaveryda,"Post is slightly larger than normal size. If you have smaller earring holes,may cause you some problems. I love the earrings, am determined to work through it."
2,beautiful,"I just find the posts to be thicker than I would like for my small earlobes and holes. Otherwise, they are of wonderful quality and arrived exactly as promised."
4,Great quality,"I got these as a gift for myself, great quality, sturdy, comfortable to wear, I don't even feel they're there! They're a bit bigger than I expected, maybe next time I'll go for the smaller thicker ones on offer here at Amazon (if they go on sale! hint hint!) Even with my long curly hair they show. I'm very satisfied.Update: More than a year later and these earrings are perfect, I even sleep with them. They get mega abuse and they're still going strong."
5,Great Hoops!,These hoops are perfect for any occasion! I am currently enduring chemotherapy and have lost all of my hair. These hoops are the perfect accessory with my bandana-doo!
2,Beware,I ordered these hoop earrings for a christmas present. The post opening is extremely narrow and one would have to have very skinny ear lobes to feel comfortable. This opening of the earring should be listed in the description. I wouldn't have purchased these and wouldn't be out my return shipping. There is no room for a proper reason for return of the item and it's grouped into not wanting the item.
5,engaging the mystery,"I am still reading the book but approaching the final chapters now. I found it in a used bookshop one day in February, while I was struggling with my father's hospitalization and the caregiving challenges that went along with it. My father died two weeks later. I am now also caring for my mother who has been hospitalized at around the same time my father was hospitalized in a separate hospital, in a separate country. This book has been my constant friend in my long journey over the last two months. It has helped me a lot. I appreciate that it is not written in a ""how-to"" or-- as one other reviewer here says-- more ""coherent"" kind of style. There is nothing coherent about the mysteries of life and death, so one can never box it into something coherent. One can only share the journey by sharing one's stories, and how one has dealt with one's own challenges. This book does that. And in that, it is a blessing."
4,"Love, love and more love!","So nice of Elvis to put these songs together for us. Har har. Well it's pretty easy to collect a bunch of love-related Elvis songs. It's about as hard as gathering love songs from the Bee Gee's or Chicago. Anyway, my favorite thing about this compilation is the inclusion of ""Young And Beautiful"" AND ""Fame And Fortune"". Two of my favorite songs of his in one place. Plus this album begins and ends with two well-known classics, there's the Dylan cover ""Tomorrow Is A Long Time"", and E's version of ""Fever"". Not bad at all. I actually own this on vinyl, and some of the copies come with RED vinyl. I'm not that lucky though. Are there a ton of songs missing, sure. But based on what's here, I LOVE it. Happy Valentine's Day!"
2,Too frustrating and time consuming,"We have a Spiderman game similar to this, but comparing the two, the Batman game is way too difficult and time consuming to be fun. When my 6 year old son and I played, it took us both atleast 10 turns before either of us knocked down any of the targets. (and we're not dummies either). The launcher is difficult to aim, and since there is only 1 launcher, and the batmans have to be placed on the launcher in a specific direction it is time consuming to load in between each attempt to launch. We were both frustrated every time we played as there is no positive feedback for the child unless they are patient enough to try and try again before they finally succeed in knocking down a target."
5,Nice!,What can I say. I got this book for my wife and she loves it. Even her guitar instructor wanted to steal it. A book two with other of the Led Zeppelin's songs would be nice :-)
5,Unforgettable Swings!,"Unforgettable has a great selection of swing tunes. My aunts used to sing ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"" (around the house) when I was a kid, so this cd brings back some fond memories for me. This cd has a number of lively vocals as well as instrumentals."
5,Dance like no one's watching...,"While I was writing ""I Kept My Word,"" in conjunction with Clarence Wolfe, a World War II veteran, who told the story of Glenn Miller's death, a friend gave me this particular CD of Miller's music. I loved it so much that I purchased one for the vet, as he just had some old worn-out tapes with some of his favorite Glenn Miller tunes. I think he will wear this CD out, too! The classical sound of Glenn Miller has already touched generations, and I predict it will continue to do so. After my book came out, I was amazed at how many young people knew Glenn Miller's music and were eager to read more about him."
3,Glenn Miller,I was a little disappointed in this CD. Somehow the music of his band I have heard previously seemed to sound better. Don't know why.
2,Don't buy this collection unless you prefer scratches and pops,Listen to the sample of Tuxedo Junction -- even on this remaster you can clearly hear the source LP scratches and pops. Compare the same song on Essential Glenn Miller (1995 or 2005).
4,Bikram's Begonning Yoga Class,"I like. I tried the postures, but definatle you need a instructor to do this yoga not only a book. I pay my yoga classes in a studio and classes are extremely expen sive, but definately I feel good practicing."
4,Witty yet simple guide book,"This book is easy to follow with plenty of photos and a witty intro to each of the 26 sequential poses.It is useful for those doing the Bikram course, but not a replacement unless you had a lot of experience in Bikram's hatha poses."
1,Not for every dosha,"Bikram does not take into consideration that doing strenuous exercise in 102 Fahrenheit for 90 mins is going to send a Vata/Pitta body type into straight rage. Before I started doing some research on this, I would be simply baffled by the fact that instead of feeling balanced and calm and composed (all the things that my 6 years of Iyengar practice leaves me with), a Saturday morning Bikram class would send me on a 'killing spree' and road rage and just absolutely unacceptable behaviour toward husband and people in general. Then I find out that it totally aggravates Vata/Pitta, so now I'm all set with it. Never again Bikram. Also, it amazes me how much verbal abuse people can take from a guy who's ego could do with a little toning down, maybe just a little... He might benefit from reading the Sutras every now and then."
4,Good companion.,"The book is actually a bit different from the actual practice, but nevertheless a great companion to it, especially if you are just beginning with Bikram. Even if you can't (like myself) follow all the asanas you will notice that the regular practice of Bikram Yoga lets you feeling great!You have to try it!"
4,"A nice book, but....","I really enjoy Bikram yoga and find this book helpful. I also really appreciate that they have updated the book with current pictures of the same yoga models years later--I find this very inspiring as they all still look great and healthy. However, am I the only one that finds Bikram the man to be a bit of a jerk???? Some of this stuff is just mean. I had a friend who went to his main studio who went out of her way to catch his wife's classes and not his. After reading this, I understand."
1,"Hold the ego, please.","The postures in the book are fine, but there are many great yoga books out there where you don't have to deal with the HUGE Beverly Hills ego of Bikram. I saw many reviewers found his abuse and arrogance as humor, and in a way I guess a guru in Beverly Hills would have to be abusive and sarcastic to get spoiled, rich people to do some work, and as most gurus he says his way is the ""only way"". But if you need abuse with your yoga, you just don't get it."
4,One of Betty Neel's best,"Although I am not completely enamored of this book as the one reviewer was, I still think it was a Betty Neel's keeper. The plot was more varied than some of her books and the characters kept you interested. I don't agree that the female protagonist was being rescued right and left. One interesting difference that is lacking in most of Betty Neel's books is that she actually went out of her way to attract the hero! She was also spunky and intelligent! This is one of Betty Neel's earlier books and worth reading! Not as good as Dearest Mary Jane or Henrietta's Castle but up there with the best."
3,Caroline's Review,I love Paul Brown products but I wish they would revamp the spray bottle. Whenever I try to spray it one of two things happens. The spray will not come out and when it does it goes down other than out. I thought it was a defective bottle the first time around and then I ordered a new bottle and it did the same thing.
2,You'll Force Yourself to Finish,"A combination of it's-all-been-done-before wrapped into one book. Sure, this guy can write but a little over technical for guys like me, forcing you to skip ahead. There's major disaster in the plot, which if it really occured, people are too damned calm about it, making it unrealistic. He wrote this in a tidy style that it's probably going to be a movie. Wait for the video, better yet. You force yourself to finish, the last 100 pages reduced to quick skimming. The cruise ship part is ludicrous, where all the main characters develop powers to take on everyone."
4,good but not his best,The book was very good. At points a little far fetched but not too much. Story lines very well developed and all comes together at the end. Good book. Well written but he has better books.
4,Jake Grafton is THE MAN.......lol,"The continuing amazing stories of Jake Grafton! A fun read with the usual cast of good guys and baddys. I liked it well enough. Nothing new here, actually read it in 2012 so unavoidably a little dated, but these kind of books serve a purpose and this one does it pretty well. One complaint is that maybe Jake Grafton has run his course and should be retired, he has done his bit admirably."
2,Good - until the ending,"An entertaning book and nicely paced. Until the end that is. The last 100 pages or so are written as if the author got tired of working on the story and simply put a bunch of disjointed, action bites together so the book could be rushed to the publisher. I have read just about every ""Grafton"" book and this one is the most disappointing. Would not recommend it.`"
3,Back to form,"After the dire 'Hong Kong' this is a vast improvement.Jake Grafton investigates a submarine hijack that snowballs into a significant attack on the US with warheads that detonate an EMP pulses that melt down power capability.Fast moving and with some interesting ideas this is a return to form for Coonts. This is not up in the Clancey league but it is an entertaining novel non the less. It would have been interesting to see more of a focus on the aftermath of the city meltdown (you get the impression that ""and then everyone lived happily ever after"") and the plot device towards the end that has some senior navy types (and assorted women) going all SAS to get the bad guys was a little weak!While not perfect, still worthy of your time..."
3,Hard to believe,"I enjoy a Coonts novel as much as anyone but I finished reading America with mixed feelings. The story line is a bit far fetched but none the less exciting and action packed. Evil triumphs over good through most of the book however, it was dissapointing that over 95% of the book was dedicated building this story line. Grafton's success in foiling the bad guys didn't happen till the final pages. It leaves the reader with the feeling that the author brought the novel to a quick close when he reached the requisite 500 pages for his publication."
4,A Deepwater Extravaganza,"I found this novel to be very entertaining. The Sub world of the Navy was somewhat unknown to me as that was not my end of the Navy but I certainly enjoyed the wording and had no trouble following the Nautical terms and situations. I have found Mr.Coonts to be a very strong story teller. This is my third book read and all have been very good. As there is truth in all fiction this one made me think quite deeply ""What If?"" After 9/11 we have all come to beleive that anything can happen at any time, ergo this story. I am sure anyone will enjoy this novel especially Navy folks and civilian sailors."
2,Coonts has lost it,"S. Coonts started out great with Flight of the Intruder, but every book since then has lost more and more. Kind of childish."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This My Little Pony product does not live up to expectations. My daughter received this toy for Christmas and we just can not get it to work. Additionally, the permanant fixture on one foot prevents this pony from being used with anything else. This poor pony is definately left out in the cold while the other ponies get lots of attention from my little girl."
4,She definitely has something to say!,"Billie Miles is a women with a different point of view to show us. Her voice is like a combination of Erykah Badu, Billie Holiday, Nelly Furtado and Estero laid down over some very smooth beats. Sister girl talks a lot of game in a voice that dares you to disagree. I first heard her on my local jazz station that plays Neo-soul,House and Rare Grooves. If this is the kind of music that you enjoy, check out Ms Miles. The first song, ""Your Love Is A Lie"", is the strongest track but the others are definitely on point. So get yourself a glass of merlot, sit back, and hear what she's saying."
3,Surprise Sound/Man Hater's melody,"I thought Ms. Billy Miles had an intriguing 'surprise sound'. I enjoyed the album, for what it is. . . not very deep, but fun to sing along with. I was bothered by her 'man hating' lyrics. I'd rather hear more positive wording, but her unique voice makes the songs enjoyable. While playing, it's a brief conversation piece at parties. I think once Billy gets more in touch with her ""Inner-Artist"". . . her albums will become more profound."
1,Cheaply Made & Flimsy,"When I bought the Artone neckloop, I had already tried other devices with my hearing aids. The plastic-coated loop wire was thicker than the devices I had had before, so that was a plus. Having a loop was better than having cell phone accessories pulled off of your ear when caught on something. (I don't want to wear a wire under my shirt. I like the convenience of taking it off and putting it on at will.) I was happy with it for a while, and then, after about a couple of months, it stopped working. I suspect the loop got a short in it; no matter how hard I tried to wiggle it around, I couldn't get it to working again. Also, the device case, even though lightweight, is made of cheap plastic. I wouldn't buy it again, but will look for something more durable."
1,Totally Contrived Movie,"I've had the opportunity of seeing this movie on DVD recently and I have to say that I wish that I would have my time and money back. The characterization, performances, and premise of the movie was totally contrived and also this movie never explains how and why school shootings occur(which is mainly why I watched this movie in the first place), which I think is an exercise in futility and is totally overlooking the real issue here.If anyone wants to see a good movie that really makes you think about how and, most importantly, why school shootings happen I would recommend the ""Zero Day"" movie(which I think is still playing in select areas) instead of ""Home Room""."
1,"Amateur, badly written, full of cliches","This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I rented it, having heard great things about it, but it was terrible."
2,"Boring, slow pace, cliche","I don't see why this movie is highly rated. Very unlikable, simple characters, predicatble story - could have been told in 44 min tv show."
5,EXCELLENT movie,"If you've seen Elephant, it's the same scenario as that essentially, but MUCH MUCH better, and this movie is not easy to track down so snatch it up now."
4,Great but very strong smell,"Oh these are apple cider vinegar capsules alright. You can smell them from a mile away. Great low cost and high quantity (as per usual with the Now Foods products) but it has a super strong smell, so you've been warned!"
2,Did not work for my acid reflux,"I bought this product after reading in several sources that it might help with acid reflux. I read a theory that acid reflux can be caused by not having enough stomach acid and food fermenting in the stomach... but I think I might just have too much acid from anxiety and stress. I really liked that this product was in pill form, it was much nicer than the actual vinegar which I couldn't bring myself to swallow. However it just upset my stomach if I took it while I was having reflux. I tried just taking it in the morning and I was fine, but it didn't help with my stomach. But who knows... it may help you- I am going to try marshmallow root next."
2,Taste Gross but good 4 ya :),I hate the taste of Bragg's apple cider but I know the Benifits of it! So I thought the pills would be better-- still gross tasting but better than the cider
3,just OK,This didn't really make me feel any better after taking for 4 weeks. I'm not sure if it's the potency or dosage or what.
3,Did not specify veggie caps,"so I have to dump the capsules, but that's kind of okay, I should have been more careful. Most of NOW's products are veggie caps. The product is fine, but make sure that when people are ordering with the word ""veggie caps"" that the product is really vegetarian."
5,The World Wide Web of Music,"The Scale Chord Synopticon is an essential addition to any musician interested in expanding their musical vocabulary. Approaching the basic elements of musical organization as a series of matematical patterns with clearly defined limits rather than as a historical/ethnological search for what has already been used, Powell and Fowler have created what is essentially a directory of all possible scales and chords within the tempered 12-note system of Western music. I recently used it to explore all the possible three-note chords, from a three-note chromatic cluster to the symmetric augmented triad; using the Synopticon was far quicker than trying to work out the possibilities on my own."
2,So Damn Unhappy!,"I'm a fan of Ree's music and I pay my due respect to the Queen of Soul but she misses it on this album.She recorded too many tracks in her falsetto tone which becomes annoying after the fifth or so track. She also has a vocal sound that makes me think that she had her dentures in while she recorded this album.The album overall pulls Ree in too many directions - from the hip hop flavoured tracks Holding On and No Matter What (featuring Mary J. Blige on background vocals) to Good News (a gospel track) to the title track and You Are My Joy (which Ree wrote and produced herself), there are too many genres on one album. And why did she include a reprise of You Are My Joy? It was unnecessary.Overall, the album did not inspire me and after listening to it a few times, it left me empty. I hope Ree will make up for it in her next release. And Ree, please tone it down on the falsetto vocals."
2,So damn painful!,"That falsetto! Ouch!!! My Lord, someone take the microphone away from this woman! In all seriousness, this is a pleasant album, and a queen like Aretha can sing the phone book for all I care (and I'll still buy her albums), but this set is missing a masterpiece like ""A Rose Is Still A Rose,"" which graced her last non-masterpiece of an album. The songs with Mary J. Blige are nice...but please, Aretha, stop singing in that horrible falsetto."
5,Still the Queen!!!,"Aretha is still holding her title as the Queen of Soul. And this album only adds to her long list of greats. She always seems to find something that can touch the listeners hearts, minds and imaginations. This album does exactly that. One of my favorites is Wonderful. My entire family, joins in to sing along with this upbeat soulful hit. If you want to party all through the house, this is the album for you."
1,"YIKES! BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID!!!!!!!!!!!","After collecting Ms. Franklin's work of 43 years, this is, without a doubt, the worst thing she has ever done. It's an absolute mess. That clarion voice of the church has disappeared. If I didn't know that SYLVESTER was already dead, I would have sworn that this CD was by him. Ms. Franklin needs to retire and rest on her considerable laurels.She has an amazing array of recorded material to her benefit! Yes, I'm still a great admirer of her work. However, this latest release is simply not up to her usual standard. PLEASE listen to anything else by her---but, just NOT THIS!!!It's so terrible, that I recall Ethel Merman, who also had a big, strong voice, who became a joke in her later years.I can only hope that this same fate doesn't befall Ms. Franklin.She has always been one the greatest voices ever recorded. ""So Damn Happy"", however, is a horrible tribute to this great woman."
2,"She may be, but I am certainly not...","Firstly regarding the albums copy protection, The CD would not play in my car's CD player, not a good start! I would have decided to make an analogue CD copy if it was what I was expecting. Unfortunately it disappointed me greatly, why is it that once great and legendary artists seem to feel that adding some ""IN"" producers and names onto a production will rush it to success? Where is the fantastic arrangements, the power and emotion of her awesome voice. To me they could have rolled any number of todays anodyne vocalists onto the project and printed it out with Aretha's name.Enough said, Avoid"
4,Falsetto...so what?,"I don't understand what is wrong with singing in falsetto...don't you guys have falsettos too? Rubbish.In anycase, Aretha Franklin did not really sing in the falsetto range, it's just that she lost some of her timbre and it's getting a little muffled even in her true range but I still take my hats off her - not many can sing like that at 61.I also feel that even at the age at 61, one can still sing sappy love songs...and I feel damn happy to know she's still alive and kicking..."
4,"The Queen Of Soul Is Back And ""I'm So Damn Happy"" About It!","""So Damn Happy"" is a slammin cd! Aretha's voice is so beautiful; there's just something so wonderful about that voice no matter what tone she sings in. It really is a special treat to hear her sing. I forgot that she plays piano so I was surprised and happy to see that she plays on the songs she wrote on this album. She's a great writer. (She is definitely blessed with awesome talent.)I play this cd over and over again. I just can't get enough of it. She definitely proves why she is the Queen of Soul. I must admit that my favorites on the cd are: The Only Thing Missin, Wonderful, So Damn Happy, You Are My Joy, and Good News. Whether you're at work, home or riding in your car, this is the cd to listen to; it's the jam! Go Queen!"
4,so damn good!,"Okay - have the people who gave this album 1 or 2 starts truly listen to the album?First off, the music and production of this album is, how can I describe it, ""I've heard this before"". So what? This woman has an AMAZING VOICE - even after 43 years of singing, the woman still has the groove, and such a sexy voice. All the songs are stellar, wonderfully sung, and have a meaning.I really don't have a favorite song, all the songs are unique in each way. If you are tryin' to hear some of Ms. Franklin's ol' stuff - you'll hear some influences, but most of the songs are 'modern'. Nonetheless, a wonderful early Christmas present! Thank you Aretha!So, ignore the bad reviews and buy this album."
2,I will remember the way it used to be,"I have loved Aretha Franklin since the sixties, and have purchased anything she put out. She had some clunkers, but that voice could somehow transcend weak songs and production, but this cd and the Rose I parted with. No one can take away her greatness, and her place in music history. And if I was to be stranded on a desert island, I would grab my Aretha box set first. Some voices are fragile, a gift from the angels, and when it goes it goes. Some voices improve with time, deepen, thicken, have a life-worn texture. Now is the time for Aretha to know her vocal limitations and give us some music with depth. Take a page out of the Betty Lavette songbook. Stop trying to be current, and give us some soul. You want some great Aretha, get Rare and Unreleased."
3,Grown Folks Music.........,"I am ""So Damn Happy"" that there are artist that still make music for the grown people. When i watch TV or listen to the radio, its like experiencing one big high school talent show!!!!!!!Thank God for Aretha, Whitney, Dionne, Melba, Natalie, Chaka & Patti. Where is music going ..............I don't have a clue. Aretha continues to capture the youthful and mature experience. ""Good News"" is a great affirmation of reason for goin' to service on Sunday Mornin', honey! ""So Damn Happy"" is a R&B excuse for good music. Aretha swings and sways with the music all the way thru.Less listenable track are the Mary J tracks....not worth mentioning . When you buy the cd, you'll know which tracks they are.Oh, by the way, BUY THE CD!!!!!! It's a great buy and a better purchase than other cd's!!!!!"
3,goodies & badies (imo),"I think that some producers need to calm her down or better said, don't push her so hard to reach those very high keys (anymore). Give her songs she can DO ! She's still a fantastic singer but please ACCEPT her limitations, these days. She's 61 for God sake. Why is it a shame that she can't do it anymore just like she sang in the past ? She still can sing like nobody else but with some restrictions."
1,It's time for Aretha to leave the teen life behind,"I don't know what I expected but not this. Aretha Franklin has always, since I heard 'Won't be long' been my favorite singer.So I want to tell her. Aretha, you are 61 years old. You can use your brains and knowledge now and not the power of youth. Stay away from Mary Blige and Jimmy Jam and anyone else who tries to make you a hip hop star. You are a mature woman. No more best sellers for you. Try to leave something to be proud of. If not, remember the wonderful opera singer, Beverly Sills who retired at 50 at the top of her game. Really, it is unbecoming for a woman of 61 to moon about being left waiting again, and wanting to be kissed etc. Aretha, do not put out another dull, ordinary, string filled, syrupy recording like this. Next time, Sing some old songs. Just your voice and a piano. Be Brave."
3,"The voice, but those songs","The lead-off single ""The Only Thing Missing"" raised hopes that this would be an Aretha record without trendy/generic production. The song is sassy, breezy, and soulful -- everything we want from Aretha. And she sounds fantastic and energized over an arrangement that grooves without being self-consciously trendy. But like Luther Vandross' recent album, the rest of the songs feature stellar vocals, yet mostly mediocre production/material. Aretha's voice remains one of the great instruments of popular music, but beyond a couple of tracks (the aforementioned single, and ""Everybody's Somebody's Fool"") this is forgettable. No question, it's good to have a new Aretha record, if only to hear her sing. She does some almost miraculous things to make you forget how mundane much of this material is. Even in comparision to her best Arista material, which is fairly underrated, this is not an album that stands among her finest."
2,pretty average to me,"I'm a big Aretha Franklin but it's been longer than I care to remember since She made a Album all the way through that I could Groove to&feel Her at Her.Her last album back in 98 with ""A Rose is Still a Rose"" was pretty Good in a Modern sense.but on this Set She takes a Drastic U-Turn&this Album is too Formula driven for it's own Good to me.avoid the Mary J.Bliege stop it don't work."
1,"The Queen is... Well, she ain't what she used to be","This album is very unimpressive. Comparatively, her previous album (""A Rose..."") is a masterpiece compared to this. The 10 songs are not memorable, just average R&B; and pop, with a religious song (""Good News"") thrown in. It's almost as bad as the carwreck that was Whitney Houston's ""...Just Whitney"".The song ""Ain't No Way"" is not a self-cover of her classic Atlantic recording, it's a new song by Gordon Chambers (""That ain't no way to treat a lady""); seems like they could have given it a different title. \Giving this album one star is an exageration."
1,Nice try but yikes,She used an older picture of herself for this cd... she must definitely not like the way she looks now... I think she looks better now than 10+ years ago. Lyrics are sweet and sorrowful but the singing is lacking and has much less flavor from her early days. She is struggling to make certain notes and hesitates in many of her songs... With her talent she should have tried much harder
4,One of their (3) best efforts,"Along with abandoned luncheonette and war babies; man these guys were hitting on all cylinders at this point in their careers: ""oh, camilla"", ""alone too long"", ""sara smile"", ""it doesn't matter"", ""out of me, out of you""....put these three in your rack and you've got all you need; their early ""pure"" stuff.."
2,Dokken Live-Disappointing,"This concert dvd is lacking in quality and intensity. The picture quality is poor,while the the audio is pretty good. At first I was disappointed that they didn't show George Lynch playing very much, but I can understand it now because the guy is just not into it. He doesn't look up from his guitar once in the concert. This dvd is just for diehard Dokken fans only-maybe."
3,"Not bad, but could've been better.","Geroge Lynch is awesome and will always be. Some good songs on there, but the crowd seemsa little quiet. Also, the band plays I think too many slowed down songs. Overall it's good,but it may have been better if the crowd was more noisy and not so many slowed down versionsof good fast electric songs."
4,Dokken rocks Tokyo,"I was really wondering what to expect, as I had read some reviews of this DVD that were very down on it. I had read that the picture quality was blurry, and the sound quality was muddy. When I watched it, I was pleasantly surprised. No, it's not perfect. It's not as crisp as ""Live from the Sun"". If you want perfection for your HD system, get ""Live from the Sun"". But, this one is still pretty dang good, and has George Lynch on guitar. I don't know of any other DVD that has the classic Dokken lineup doing a full bore electric concert. ( ""One Live Night"" is cool, but is sort of ""unplugged""). I really enjoyed this DVD, warts and all, because this is rock and roll, and at this show, they really rocked!!"
2,Beware.....,"I never had the chance to see George Lynch with Dokken so I figured this would be a great way to do so. Video quality is fine but the audio is really, really lousy. I own many bootleg concerts on video and this is weak even compared to those. If you are a real Dokken ""fiend"" then you will probably like this and can overlook the subpar sound. Anything short of that, you will most likely be disappointed. I was.....oh well."
3,Not Bad,"The concert itself is not bad, and that's what gets three stars. If I had seen the show that night in 1995, I would have left happy. By today's standards, the show is dated terribly, but the song selection is great, and the band was really playing well. The production values of this dvd are awful, however. It appears to have been shot on video, and parts of the concert footage even appear to be warped. Also, a big boo to whoever put this together for editing out (poorly) all of the ""in between songs"" banter. As soon as one track ends, the screen goes black, then another track starts. I'd rather have had the whole concert experience. But for it's original lineup and for the EXCELLENT acoustic version of Dream Warriors on the bonus features, this one gets three stars. You could do worse, just be aware of the faults with this disc."
2,Horrible quality,"I hate to say it, but this DVD really does suck. The quality is the worst quality DVD I've ever bought. Seriously people, it looks like a bootleg. I gave it two stars because a die-hard Dokken/Lynch fan, like myself, would probably want it on their shelf even though you probably will only watch it once. Good luck!"
2,Half Acoustic other Half No Effort Expended,"A quick cash grab show. There is no energy or enthusiam in this what so ever. Don of course can not hit the high notes anymore, if he ever could in the first place (fix in the mix with pro-tools). George cannot play the solos anymore, if he ever really played them on the albums in the first place (special guest - Mike Slammer?). Segments are from 1995, 1999, and 2000 so you can see the progress of Don's hillarious wigs. Four of the songs starting with Unchain the Night and the garbage from the Shadow life are acoustic. Oh boy, a bonus track...Dream Warriors...acoustic! I know Don was about 60 when this show filmed, but how did rocken with Dokken go from Tooth and Nail to being boring old folk artists. We want the kick ass rockin with Dokken hair metal band, not the Peter Paul and Mary style Dokken. Dokken is not an acouistic band. Dokken used to rhyme with Rockin. Here it does not come anywhere even close to rockin."
1,I'll tell you why,"I would have given this 4 stars if it weren't for the lousy video and terrible audio....... George can't seem to play as fast as he used to but he is still an excellent guitar player. Don is having a little trouble hitting the higher notes but it's not enough to hurt the songs. I'm actually surprised Dokken released a DVD of this horrible quality. He should fire the sound engineer on this one. Don't get me wrong, I love this band but this DVD was a big disappointment."
5,Awesome Delivery!!! Awesome Performance!!!,"I bought two 512mb chips and my computer is running like new!!! I have a HP Pavilion ze4400 laptop that came with 256mb standard. I decided to order the two chips and max it out. It's like I have a new computer for under $[...].I got my order in two days!!! Thanks Amazon, that kicked some serious [...].I am not a computer savvy person. I called a friend who said it was easy and that all I needed was screw driver. I popped out the old chip and inserted the two new ones and bang, I was flying. Nice to be able to open iTunes and play music and do other things without a major slow-down or freeze.I almost bought a new laptop, but this solved that problem. Kick ACE!!!"
3,Lightweight guide to bonds,"Full of useless info (the days of the week on which Treasury auctions take place, for example) larded with annoying attempts at humor. Fidelity and Pimco have the essentials about bonds on their websites, the latter for free, so why buy this?If you're really interested in the fixed-income market, I suggest Patrick Brown's ""An Introduction to the Bond Markets"". Even if you ignore the math, you'll learn far more, and have a book worth more than a single read."
5,A Must Have,"As a former techie who found his way to the wonderful world of supporting a fixed income desk, I found this book to be an excellent overview of the bond market. The author explains complex concepts such as duration and yield in terms that anyone can understand. This is by far the best introductory book to the bond market I have read (and I have read many)!"
1,Waste of Money,Not very in depth and you can get it for free in HTML format at cramsession's web site. Not that you would want to. It is of minimal value at best.
4,Very small but cuts well,These are very small and should probably only be used on cooked or soft veggies. Not that they aren't sharp enough but it would be difficult to do since they are small. They are a good size for carrots. I use these to make shapes in my carrots to give a little variety in my bento packed lunch. The heart one looks especially cute. I find that it's easier to use if you use the larger end of a chopstick to push the cut veggie out.
1,didn't receive what was pictured,"I was very disappointed when this product arrived. The cutters that I received were not the same ones pictured on the box. The description does not state that there might be variations, so I expected to receive the shapes that are on the box lid.I contacted Ateco, the company that makes them, to see if they would switch out the substitutes for the missing cutters, but they never responded. If I hadn't ordered them for a specific shape (one that I didn't receive, of course), I might have kept them. The picture and description are misleading."
1,2002 Dodge Neon,"First off it's not the right hitch as picture shows, If i knew i wouldn't order it you have to drill extra 2 holes and drop the exhaust. Second the hitch showed up all beat up and scratched pretty bad, didn't come with instructions, hardware or drawbar like amazon says. Really disappointed would never buy from here again, was better off going to uhaul and do it there on the spot......"
4,one of the best of the early albums,"This album goes beyond the spacey sounds of the early cuts such as 'Atem' and 'Alpha Centauri'; captures the mood, not just the location. Paves the way for the later albums that deal with location, e.g. 'Canyon Dreams' and 'Le Parc'."
2,Some good tidbits.,"Hello. :) If you're interested in keeping variety in your exercise regimen, this product can guide you on the right path. However, I find that the narration slightly annoying and that the author recommended you to lock your elbow during the punching inpact on the heavy bag segment of his program--that's a no no by the way. NEVER lock your joints. If your serious about learning to box and do some hard work on fitness, try something else. Tape is only good as an outline with some good tidbits. Thank-you."
3,Does the job,"This is a good video. Sean O'Grady knows his stuff, but the music was kinda cheezy. A big plus that it was hosted by a former boxer."
1,"Horrible book, errors galore","This is the worst textbook I've ever come across. Tons of grammatical errors and inconsistencies with monetary units, such as using British pounds and Dollar signs intermixed when they shouldn't be. Basic math skills seem to be lacking from the authors because many of the numbers don't add up. This is totally inexcusable for an accounting-based text. No website for the errata either. Avoid at all costs."
1,screenplay companion book,"This book was a major failure. It didn't read well and was confusing to manuever through. Being a only a novice screenwriter, I wanted some help, and I thought this book might help me, it did not. I could have made these pages better when I was in high school. I would certainly not recommend this book to anyone else. Deeply disappointed in it's hype, ..."
2,a modern failure in medieval settings,"Ms Rowland's Black Lotus fails to summon up any the atmosphere you would expect in this context. It is not sufficient to add ""-san"" to names or replace ""gun"" by ""katana"" to transform a modern day novel into investigation in medieval Japan. The relationships between people are all wrong; characters are too simple, archetypal, the plot is feeble and from page 50 everything is already clear. The are several historical inconsistencies, such as the use of kerosene to start a fire...a good idea but poorly executed."
4,An Historical Mystery,"In 1693 Japan, Samurai-detective Sano Ichiro, is called in to investigate the remains of a fire in the Black Lotus temple where three people are found dead. Secretly, and against Japanese tradition at the time, Sano has an autopsy done on the three bodies only to discover that they were dead before their bodies were burnt. An orphan girl, Haru, is found near the scene but will not speak to anyone regarding the events. Against his better judgment, Sano asks his wife, Reiko, to assist him in interrogating the girl. Reiko is convinced of the Haru's innocence, despite the fact that she is a pathological liar. Investigating on her own, Reiko causes some stress on her marriage as she discovers that the Temple of the Black Lotus houses some very nasty secrets. The reader is continually on the edge of their seat, guessing what the outcome will be."
2,"Gender roles and ""time feeling""","I must agree with several of the earlier (male) reviewers. To me, the gender roles in this book fit perfectly in American suburbia of the fifties and sixties, not in 17th century Japan. The behavior of Sano's wife is unrealistic and ridiculous for the time period in question.In general, the book doesn't feel very ""Japanese"" at all. Change Sano's horse for a car, the samurais' swords for guns and the tatami mats for wall to wall carpeting and you'll have an off the shelf modern mystery.Some reviewers claim that Rowland's other books are better, and I'll give her books one more try before I give up on them. After all, there aren't that many authors out there for a ""japanophile"" like myself."
2,pseudo samurai tales,"i must admit that i often failed not to judge a book by its cover and this is one of the many times. after all the bookcover makes the first all important impression on the impressionable.however. i am not incline to recommand this title if what you are looking for are believable japanese characters or situation. as only a mystery it is fine.i am an avid holmes reader having read and re-read the complete stories many times. i am pretty much into whodunit novels, films, and even tv. also, i'm keen japanese/samurai culture ""student"".although i cannot say i fully appreciate cross-pollination of the detective genre and the japanese samurai genre i can say i'm somewhat disappointed. i expected more authenticity. more nitty and more gritty of things japanese of that time. which is to say i am not only interesting in whodunit and why and how but more interested in 17th century japan, and how this setting is used to stage this detective story."
2,Did anyone else want to strangle Pinocchio?,"My son received this as a gift for Christmas and I wasn't very impressed. The storyline is pretty stupid and Pinocchio is just annoying. The animation is bad, too, and, I noticed that the animators seem to have an obsession with characters sweating that I found to be quite odd (and almost annoying). That said, my three year old loves it. There is a scene at the end where they shoot Pinocchio that I don't think is appropriate for a a kid so young so this one is going to be put away until my son gets a little older."
2,The original walt disney is always the best.,I was diappointed in this european version of pinnochio. It was poorly done; story line and all. I'll stick with an american version and walt disney's productions at all times from now on.
2,Vancouver region (further afield section),"The section on Vancouver region (further afield) is poor and lacking in any depth. The tiny section on Fraser River and Canyon does not explore tremendeous riches of the area, nor is it specific where to visit. Do your research and see other guide books and also explore the web resources if you are planning to do some day trips outside of Vancouver."
4,Use this book to plan your trip!,"Recently we attended a wedding in Portland, Oregon and decided to see some things while we were there. This book was extremely helpful as we were deciding what to see and do. This book is colorful and so pleasing to the eye. There are lots of photos and the maps are excellent. It gives a general overview of the area, and you learn a bit about the history too. We narrowed down what we could do in the time we had available and we took in the Columbia River Gorge area including Multnomah Falls, Portland (definitely go to Powell's Bookstore - one of the largest bookstores in the world), and then part of the Oregon coast. We stayed in Seaside, but Cannon Beach is less touristy and a nicer town. Make sure to visit Haystack Rock during low tide to see the sea stars and sea anemones in the tidal pools. Enjoy your trip! The other book that we found very helpful Is Insight Guides: The Pacific Northwest."
3,Nice bright light.,"Three stars instead of five because I had to do a slight modification as there were tabs on two sides that I had to dremmel out in order to fix my lamp fixture. Other than that, these bulbs work quite well."
2,Great Game if it were 2000,"No effort has been made on this games engine since F-18 Korea came out. Its joystick support is poor, its graphics are boxy and un-detailed and sadly it is still one of the best fighter combat games for mac. That is a truly sad commentary on the state of the market."
1,Dont buy if you've ever played any flight sim game before.,Everything about this game is terrible. You can't ever program the keys like you want. & forget it about using a joystick with throttle controls.
1,No support,"You can forget techinal support. I was having joystick issues. I downloaded their update; and, it was nothing but jibberish. I e-mailed techsupport; and, they were arrogant and refused to help."
2,"Really Realistic, not much fun","If you are looking for a flight simmulator that reacreates exactly what its like to fly fighter missions (including the boredom of flying for hours before encountering an enemy) with decent landscape and ok graphics, this is for you. If your looking to have fun, and not actually to train to be a pilot, then don't bother. Flying is hard, the controls are very sensative, which I suppose is realistic but not fun. If you're looking for a FPS where you get to fly instead of walk around with a gun, this is not it. There are better game out there (though mostly on PC)."
2,Small,I was hoping to use ts in my microwave/convection oven but it was so small as to be useless. I wish it was bigger
4,Nice silpat.,"I have been using silpats for a number of years with my sheet pans for baking. I bought this to use with the 13 inch round pan that came with my new Breville oven. It is a bit small for that. It is actually smaller than a 10 inch diameter circle-. I decided to keep it and use it anyway. It would be nice to use inside a smaller microwave as well. In general, I think Silpats are great."
5,Best purchase,"I use this as a cover for the food we put in the microwave- nothing sticks to it, even cheese and we just need to rinse it to keep it clean. I also use it in the bottom of my superwave oven (halogen convection oven) to catch the drips- so easy to clean! I love this and am currently saving for the larger sizes for my cookies and meats-"
2,Nice looking but don't hold up,"I bought these for my wife for Christmas 2005. By August 2006 one of them fell apart. The gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld, which broke. It was not due to any abnormally rough handling. It would have cost $50.00 to have repaired. Now they're throw-aways."
2,disappointed,"these looked great online and when I received them, but the wires are too short if your lobes are thick. They piinch when closing them."
5,She Loved Them,"I was scarred to death, spending money on jewelry I had only seen a picture of was risky.But, she loved the gold and silver look and how light they were.She has not taken them off since.Couldn't be happier."
5,"Very, very nice. My wife loved them.",Very shiny and just the right size. My wife had been looking for two toned hoops such as these and was unable to locate. These turned out to be a perfect Christmas gift.
4,Nice but a little dated,These are nice for the mature lady. They are broad and I think would look better if you have longer hair.
5,Love them!,My Husband bought these earrings for our Anniversary. They are perfect! I had been looking for a pair with both yellow and white gold for some time. They are not too small and not too big and very shiny. I would have like to have seen a measurement of the circumference in the ad. They did turn out to be the right size for me.
5,lovely,"very nice quality. these were sturdier and heavier than I'd anticipated, an excellent surprise. I'd recommend them highly. Great value"
2,Very Heavy!!,"I purchased these earrings and was pleased with how they looked but I can't wear them they are so heavy. They really hurt my ears, really a waste of money, I have other hoop earrings and have never had this problem before."
1,Hurt My Ears,I couldn't lock the clasp by myself and once locked they hurt my ears. I couldn't keep them on for 5 minutes. Not suited for my ears. I've not had this problem with other ear rings.
2,very lite!!,"The earrings looks better in pictures. When you hold it, they feel very light and cheap, like accessories. One earring keeps falling from my wife's ear. The lock mechanism keeps on unlocking."
1,what cheap pieces of crap...like costume jewelry...haha...MSRP 600...not a chance,"these are cheap, costume jewelry type of earings. They have a made in Dominian republic tag on them. Box opened and immediately sent back for refund. Not a chance these are $600 ear rings."
1,Complete Sham!,"Don't be fooled by the ridiculous description of Duragold. These earrings are made of a rare substance commonly referred to as plastic. I am reminded of an old Bob Newhart routine where he referred to ""Diamacron"", the lustrous stones nearly as rare as glass. I bought these earrings for my wife for Christmas but there was no way I would give them to her. They are cheap in appearance and the lack of weight is a dead giveaway that there is no precious metal anywhere in these things. In any event, I can't comment on what the other reviewers are saying but I wouldn't give $1 (literally) for these, let alone $199. Caveat emptor."
1,ignore the other reviews,"Got the earrings last week and promptly returned them. Weight is very light contrary to what the other reviewers said and it looks and feels like it is worth $50, not $600 or even $199."
4,My wife really liked them!!!,My wife likes them very much and has been wearing them quite a lot lately.I have to say that they look very good on her.Shipping was slower than promised (only a couple of days) so I missed my wife's Birthday (my fault for ordering late).
5,Excellent buy!,"These will be terrific everyday earrings. They are quite substantial i.e. are not super small, sit well on the ear, and can be seen easily as crossover earrings through long hair. They look at least as good as the picture. I have seen a lot of hoop-type earrings at major stores, and must say that the fastening post here is better than most and quite sturdy. Shipping was fast, presentation excellent. I am very pleased!"
5,Comfortable to wear,"This item was much bigger than the picture, so always check the dimensions before buying. I was surprised by the beauty of the earrings, they are classy and although they can be worn everyday they are quite dressy. Great buy!!!"
4,Give it a try,"It does what it says: ""...restores lost moisture to give you soft, manageable hair, without weighing hair down.""As long as you use it sparingly. If you get heavy-handed with it, you'll end up needing to re-wash your hair. But, used correctly, it does make your hair more manageable and keeps out the static in cold, dry, winter months."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I bought this book hoping for a wonderful, enlightening, lively poetic slam between various poets or at least a free-flowing verse extravaganza. What I got was bad teen angst poetry.The book begins with the history of the poetry slam. (Which is an intense poetic competition) Well, most of the poets out there already know what a slam is, but this seemed quaint at the time. Then came the poems. Possibly written by groundsquirrels, most of the words come off as desperate attempts to make it rhyme, or (even worse) bad writing dressed up with big words.The only poem with any meaning whatsoever is ""She Bites Her Tongue"" located in the middle of the book. The rest of this is just... ugh."
4,Poetry Slam,"""Slam"" contains many, many poems by noted slam poets and teenagers from across the country. most of the poems have a lot of heart and feel to them, and provide you with depth into the writers heart. well worth checking out."
4,High Energy!,"A really exciting spur-of-the-moment recording session. My understanding is that Clarence had short-notice that he was to lead a session and cut a disc. I think it's a really good record for a session gathered on quickly and without piano! The music suffers only a little and not at all because of Clarence's musical voice! His playing is brilliant and very much carries the session. I think if they had more time to prepare, this really good record would have been an outstanding record. Worth the price of admission no doubt."
2,Give a Boy a Gun,"Read ""Outlaw"" by Jeff Long as well. He interviewed several key people that Mr. Olsen did not include (most declined to be interviewed at the time). All in all a fairly accurate and factual book and if you lived in the area at the time it stirs strong memories and emotions. Those who lived close to the events cannot forget Bill Pogue and Conley Elms."
2,protects the screen,"while these things are pretty cheap compared to other screen protectors, they are very cheaply made. while putting them on i scratched the surface every time with the pad of my finger (not my nail) just trying to push the bubbles out. these things will work to protect the screen but will fill up with scratches very very fast which is probably why they give you five sheets. i would suggest invisible shield, even though they are more expensive they are scratch resistant and have a life of the item warranty. in conclusion you pretty much get what you pay for."
3,If there's dust in the air......................,"Yes... they work, IF you can get them peeled off the backing without touching (even the outer corners) of the sticky side, because the smallest of finger prints will ruin it. AND... if you can somehow keep microscopic dust particles from sticking to it after the backing is removed... because once dust settles on the sticky side, forget it. What I also noticed, were tiny black specs, actually only 1. I wanted to cover the screen of my LG phone but every time I cut out a square, and peeled off the back, a tiny black spec appeared on the adhesive side, and once on the LCD, it appeared as a large dust blob which was there for good. I kept having to make more squares before I got one without the black spec!After that... it was fine."
1,Not for TREO 650!,Slick product. Except that it rendered my Treo 650's touchscreen ABSOLUTELY INOPERABLE. Not even the firmest tap with the stylus would register. I'm sending these back.
5,Works perfectly with Verizon XV6800,"No problems with Verizon XV6800. No loss of clarity. I wasted 3 protectors before being able to cut one with the right size, thanks to the grid, and apply it to the screen. To avoid leaving fingerprints and dust, I wore Latex gloves and used tweezers to handle the protectors. The key to leaving no air bubbles is to apply the squeegee along the overlay as it is applied to the screen. Aligning the overlay with the screen edge was a bit tricky. Anyway, the whole process was not as painful as dictated by some reviewers. I am glad I bought these screen protectors."
3,Nice try.,"I suppose the market for PDAs won't support product-specific screen protectors anymore, but it's not terribly difficult to cut-to-fit for your model. My issue is with the thickness of the material - for Graffiti writing, my Palm TX has a much harder time converting writing to text. I spend more time entering data through the PC now, and I'm not crazy about that. So three stars is appropriate, seeing as how this product reduced the overall usefulness of my original device."
2,Uhmmmm.....,"This product might work for you. Having very high levels of patience is absolutely necessary for the process of removing the backing from the screen protector. Cutting it to size isn't difficult thanks to the grid. Like the other comment I had the experience of my PDA/phone no longer responding to screen taps once I put my first screen on however I removed it and put a second protector on and my PDA/phone's screen responded just fine. The problem seems to be a lack of quality control concerning the thickness of the screen protectors. The thin protectors work, the thicker ones don't. Hopefully more are thin than thick in your package."
2,not very good,"This product did not seem to help my plants at all. It also discolored and clouded up my aquarium water, which was very disappointing."
5,Enjoyment to read about the wolves and nature of Yellowstone N.P.,Mr. James C. Halfpenny has done a marvelous job at writing about the wovles and nature in Yellowstone N.P. I honestly could not put this book down. His vivid description of the wolves in the wild makes you feel that you are part of the story. It truly makes you feel that you are involved with the wolves of Yellowstone N.P. Makes you feel that you are there. Great reading for all that love nature and Yellowstone N.P.
5,Excellent Biography of a Complex Man and Statesman,Tht title says it all. It is a quick read and should be the first book to read on FDR.
2,mitsubishi book,we should be able to see the inside of the book. are there pictures or is it just writing?
4,Recommended,"This is one of the finest self-help books I've ever read. It helped me to identify and leave an emotionally unavailable person. However, I am struck by the similarities in the reviews for both the paperback and hardcover versions of this book. They sound amazingly alike! Perhaps the author attracts the same kind of reader."
5,"Best self-help book EVER written on dysfunctional ""loving.""","Read 'em all - Women Who Love Too Much, Men Who Hate Women & the Women Who Love Them, Love Addictions, etc. - but Bryn Collins' book is the end-all, be-all for identifying, avoiding, and healing from emotionally devastating ""relationships."" Without distracting psychobabble, Collins nails emotional unavailability, in all its forms, precisely on the head. Book contains clear examples, explanations, instructions - and practical (and do-able) solutions, with Bombeck-like wit and insights. Emotional Unavailability is the advice your mother and all your friends would have given you, if only they'd been blessed with Bryn Collins' ability to spark understanding and activate your light bulb. Best book EVER for emotionally-starved lovers past and present, this book should be required reading for entering into an intimate relationship."
4,An excellent resource,"I read this book a few years back when it came out in hardcover, but it is always right on the money when I compare it to other books that focus on specific personality disorders. This book is very good at giving you a quick, intermediate level overview of different problem character types. Armed with the overview information, you can seek out other resources for more in-depth research. For example, her chapter on the narcissist was a very good overview and many of the traits overlapped with what was spelled out in Scott Wexler's book on passive aggressive behavior.If you're clueless about your companion, this book is a good place to start looking for answers."
4,very enlightening,This explains the sickness of emotional unavailability and why it happens very well. I learned a lot and was able to move on to a healthier dating life. I wish there was more out there on this subject as it is quite an insidious and destructive issue.
5,This is probably the best book I have ever read!,"This book explains and points out signs of the many different kinds of people that are emotionally unavailable. Like the front of the book says 'recognizing and understanding....' this is exactly what it does. There are different scenarios presented through out the book giving you and even better idea of different emotionally unavailable types. Towards the end there is a quetionaire that helps identify where you might fit into in your current relationship. I really enjoyed the part over ""toxic"" people. I would recommend this book to anyone searching for answers about the people in their life and possibly looking to answers as to why some relationships just don't work."
5,"Toxic = bad, love = good","After reading this book, you will be more discerning in your choice of whom to date. Once a person has been identified as having a ""toxic personality"", the author advises to steer clear of the individual. This book will help you identify people who do not have the ability to love you in return. By the mere fact that you have chosen to read this book, it is safe to predict you will be able to relate the categories of ""toxic personalities"" to people in your life."
3,Written by a therapist,"This book is written by a therapist and it has the language and viewpoint of a therapist. Much of the book is spent categorizing the various types of dysfunctional people. The main solution proposed to dealing with unavailable people is to avoid them. The examples provided are rather extreme. The people described in this book are crazy people. The book does offer a little advice on how to firmly deal with someone who exhibits what the book describes as toxic behavior, but otherwise it is mostly a descriptive book. It is a very well-written book and I am glad that I read it. But, I did not find it anywhere near as helpful or as positive as The Five Languages of Love or even Light Her Fire. If you are dealing with a truly toxic person, I would recommend James Dobson's Love Must Be Tough."
2,Good reading if you are a teen in a relationship,"This book doesn't offer enough depth. I felt that I could have gained more watching a ""Dr.Phil"" episode."
3,Not so cost-effective collections,"This compilation contains only a few ""previously unreleased gems"". If you are a collector or a fan of The Smithereens, you had better try ""Attack of The Smithereens"" CD first."
3,For the devoted fan,"This c.d. comes nicely laden with all the crucial Smithereens album cuts you could want. Sad to say, their albums could be thin affairs. The singles would be front-loaded , but by track 9 your interest would be lost. This compiliation suffers the same fate. The pop peaks of their singles take you so high that some of the lesser tracks feel like a letdown. You might find yourself jumping tracks a lot. If you're looking for the Smithereens' cream, try Blown Away instead. All of their tastiest singles are there, and they provide a pop rush far greater than any Smithereens record, including this one."
5,Simple but effective security solution.,"This ""door club"" is an excellent security addition to our home and we feel safer at night with it in place. We love the simple DIY installation of this well thought out design; just minutes to install with simple tools. Does what other more expensive items do at a value price...without compromising the rugged quality. I especially like the door hanger as it solves the problem of the club being misplaced or kicked across the room. Have purchase one for each exterior entry door."
4,Good reinforcement to secure door,It would get 5 stars if there was some way to lock it in place. I have glass panels that could be kicked out then an intruder could reach in and lift it out.
3,NOT SILENT / Dogs come running,"This whistle is no more silent than my normal speaking voice. (I am 68 and have no better than average hearing for my age. My granddaughters say it hurts their ears.) Maybe your neighbor will not hear it if you live on a half-acre or larger lot.On the other hand, because I am not too fast on my feet, I got the whistle to stop my dogs when they want to bark at people passing on the street. It works. Even if already barking they come running the first time they hear the whistle. (I have been reinforcing with small treats most of the time.)"
3,Good deal for the price,"This large, metal, adjustable dog whistle is not truly silent, of course - no dog whistle is. But it is well made and should last forever, for all practical purposes. It has a cap that covers the adjustment that's easy enough to remove and replace, but won't come off on its own; therefore protecting your setting, once you've found the frequency that most irritates your dog. A chain connects the cover to the body, so that you won't lose it. All in all, a sturdy product that does what it is supposed to."
3,doesn't work on a neighbors dog,"my neighbor's dog barks incessantly. it's driving me crazy, so i bought this hoping it will teach him not to bark. however, since i can't see the dog's reaction i haven't been able to find the frequency that works on him so it hasn't help so far. will keep trying though. it's the best i can do since my neighbor leaves the dog alone all day long."
2,Got dogs attention somewhat but not silent.,Didn't really work with my two dogs. They only seemed to register the whistle when I could hear it and even then only with a passing fancy. The whistle it self was of decent quality of construction just not function. My child enjoyed playing with it so it wasn't a complete loss.
3,Pretty Good--attracts birds more than dogs!,"This whistle is okay--it attracts more birds than my dog!! I love how it has a case inside of itself and isreally light. My cat likes it better than the dog due to it letting birds come down to her level.But I cannot guarantee it will work for your cat.I'll keep trying with the dog, we will see if she everobeys to the whistle.Thanks for reading my review."
2,It looks a lot like a cool dog whistle,"The only problem is that it really doesn't work that well. If you use it around dogs, they really don't care about it and while it has a way to adjust the pitch of it, nothing works from the highest point to the lowest. It's not very silent either but at least it's built pretty well and it has some nice features. In other words, it will make a great cheap gift if you want someone to think you spent twice as much on it."
3,worked.... i guess,"the whistle worked the first few times. at least it got the dogs' attention. after a while though they just ignored it and kept on barking. maybe if you use it right it will work better, if you have the time. sometimes it was as though they were not even aware of it. and you can kind of hear it if your a human. its kind of annoying."
4,I liked it,"Not bad, its not a silent whistle of course you can still hear it, but it still helped me train my dog to listen. I also got it very quickly which was great."
1,Difficult textbooks,"I am just finishing up a college course using Jeffrey Slater's College Accounting, A Practical Approach 1-12, 10th edition.I am going to literally BURN this extremely difficult to understand yet expensive textbook when I'm done with it! Slater is very confusing in his teaching. I would NOT recommend learning Small Business Accounting using his books. He includes things that doesn't make any sense. The Classroom Demo problems are extremely difficult to follow. He may have years of teaching experience but he doesn't have a clue how to teach in a textbook!I am a 4.0 GPA student who will be breaking this GPA now because of this stupid textbook."
3,Wish I liked it more--Characters never really come to life.,"This is the sort of book that's usually right up my alley. I love the darker, grimmer side of crime writing. James Ellroy's one of my favorites. But I just couldn't get into Boston Teran's latest. His characters are tragic and haunted by life. They make grand speeches about how pointless everything is. Dee Storey, the hellish monster/mother at the center of the story, should be much more frightening/horrifying than she is. For whatever reason, the characters just lie there, flat on the page, never truly coming to life. This could have been a great, great book, but just doesn't quite make it."
3,Style overwhelms substance,"A style reminiscent of James Ellroy saps the reader's strength, only to be redeemed by outstanding action sequences. If the author can control the excess, the readers will follow. Some characters have vocabularies that do not fit the resumes. I'll come back for more."
3,A little too wordy for me,"I find this style of writing a little too hard for me to like. I read an average of 8 books a month, mostly crime and detective stories, so I liked the story he told. But I found myself rereading sentences and whole paragraphs to try to get to the meat of the thing. It just didn't flow for me. I'm happier with the get-right-down-to-it writing styles of Robert B. Parker and Ed McBain. I hope this writer keeps writing, but cuts back a little on the odd phrases."
3,This guy can write!!!But can he tell a story?,"I loved reading this guys two novels,because he can write with the best of them.But he cannot tell a story with the best of them.I am not a writer,so I hate to criticize too much and I will not, but the story did'nt flow very well for me.But I am a reader and I perdict this guy will be around awhile and blow our minds,he has got more potential than most writers of the last 5 or 6 years maybe 10 years,and I did say MOST writers.Others like James Lee Burke, well he has more work to do."
3,The book that never ended!,"You know you're in trouble when you start counting the pages left to read. Wacky pretentious characters. The most embarrasing use of the word (think short version of Dolores) that I have ever read. Hey Teran, If I had a quarter for every time you flung that phrase around, I'd be two bucks richer! Which is a dollar and a half more than I'd pay for this book."
4,best one I have found so far.,"This is a STUDY BIBLE, not a true commentary Bible. This study Bible is more of a comment on the chain refrence type of Bible.If you need to have your doctrine enhansed and led to a conclusion by men, which could not have been gotten from scripture alone. This is not your STUDY BIBLE.I bought a real leather one for myself; and liked it so well that I bought hardback copies for all the kids in sundayschool.The drawback of this bible is the print is small. I complained to my wife and she said ""If the print was the size I like it; (font size 11) this bible has so much stuff in it, it would be ten inches thick. I would like to see fewer maps and more concordance. As I said ""if you need to be led to a demonational doctrine conclusion in which the Bible alone won't clearly support on it's own. THIS BIBLE IS NOT FOR YOU! But as for me and my house we serve the Lord; not man made doctrines, and this Bible is the best I've found so far."
5,The only study Bible you'll ever need,"I own a couple of dozen Bibles in all sorts of translations, each which boasts a particular special feature. About three years ago, I came across this Bible in a hard cover edition and it quickly replaced most of my other Bible study tools. Three years later, I just invested in a leather copy of this same Bible and plan to use this one the rest of my life. One of the reviewers made the excellent point of carrying one Bible around, vs a Bible, a commentary, a lexicon and a concordance. Ditto!!! The NASB Study Bible by Zondervan is the ONLY Bible you'll ever need. The translation (a transdenominatinal effort) is one my Father reccomended to me as the most literal, and completely agree. The additional tools (particularly the extensive study notes) enrich your daily Bible study, and it's perfect for someone who wants to get back into a better routine of reading God's word. I'm excited about picking up this Bible and I hope others discover it's blessings as well."
2,Great translation...poor publishing quality...,"Excellent translation with extensive, but just adequate study notes... Unfortunately, publishing/binding quality is neither good nor durable. I used this Bible as my primary Bible for 2.5 years and the pages started to come out (pages not sewn in.) Paper is thin (ink can bleed through) and ghosts as well. Red letter text is rather faint. Leather quality also poor. Would only buy as reference text to keep on the shelf for occassional use...not for use on a daily basis..."
4,Not As Good As NIV Study Bible,"The NASB is a more literal translation than the NIV, but my rating is not related to that. Most of the NASB study notes were taken from the NIV Study Bible. Unfortunately, a lot of them were watered down and/or are not sufficient in the NASB."
5,NASB Zondervan Study Bible,"I bought this bible used and the company that shipped it to me had great service and the bible, which was bonded leather, was in great shape. This has become one of my top two favorite study bibles; the other being a Ryrie NASB study bible.There are plenty of reviews available regarding this bible, so I won't repeat what's already been said. This is my second copy of this NASB study bible. It's always good to have a duplicate as you can write notes and highlight one and keep the other as a reading copy. Also while you are reading/studying out of one bible, you can have other one handy to flip pages regarding center column references or notes at the bottom. It has wonderful reference notes on each page, easy to read, good all around study bible. The only improvement I can see that Zondervan needs to make is wider margins so you can write notes. Other than that, most people will benefit from this bible as a good study bible."
5,Bible,Wonderful gift for my wife. Great quality and cost on it. I saved about $25 buying the bible at Amazon.
2,High Tech music interfers,"I was disappointed in this album. I was hoping to get authentics music, drums, and singing by Native American groups--perhaps even from actual get-togethers. True, there are a few nice pieces on this album, but the electronic background music is very annoyingly New Age. I want the ""real thing""! What was worse, I had to wait a month and a half to get it!"
5,The best marinade on the market,"This stuff adds so much good flavor to anything you barbecue or roast without adding too many calories.I LOVE it on Chicken, vegetables, pork, and beef."
2,Could go either way...,"I'm really torn on this. I picked it up based on the other glowing reviews on Amazon and really looked forward to receiving it.The scent is pretty strong when you first put it on and it settles out to something a little more even and complex after about 10-15 minutes. I really wanted to like it, but while the scent is not terrible, it isn't great either. Sometimes it reminds me of flowers. Other times it reminds me of urine. Yes, really. On a positive note, this did do a good job conditioning my skin post-shave.This seems to be one of those things that, like licorice, you either love or hate. Personally, when it comes to aftershave/cologne/etc. I want something that is a sure thing or as close to it as possible, instead of taking a 50/50 chance that the lady I'm talking to (or anyone for that matter) thinks I smell like urine. I used it 3-4 times to give it a fair shot and haven't touched it since."
5,My Barber uses this,"It works fine, been using it for years. No problem with itchiness caused by after shave lotions with more scent."
1,"Well, they did reformulate it (unfortunately)...","I have been nursing a glass 12.5 oz bottle of Lilac Vegetal for about 25 years (yes, I only have used it occasionally, having quite a few other colognes/after shaves), and have always loved it. I was nearing the end (I do have a few splashes left), and decided to replace it with another 12.5 oz (plastic) bottle's worth of the stuff. Well, at some point (possibly when Pinaud went to bottling it in plastic), they altered the formulation, to its great detriment. The new(er) Lilac Vegetal is completely different, and quite unpleasant. It does have the faint odor of urine, as others have said (I was dubious without trying it myself). The cost of this unpleasant experiment was negligible, but I am very, very disappointed.Why, oh why, did Pinaud have to change it? Sic transit gloria mundi, and all that."
1,Liquid Urinal Cake,"Glad I just bought a sampler, I can't imagine anyone wearing this in public. It's lightly fragranced with lilac, with a strong urine overtone. Smells like the monkey house at Brookfield Zoo. Poured it down the drain the same day it arrived."
3,something different,it is true! You definitely smell like furniture polish (pledge) when you frist put this one...however within a few minutes the big time smell wears off and then the scent of lime stays with you for quite a while. This is a cheap after shave. I don't think it contains any alcohol as it doesn't burn when you put it on after you have shaved.
3,very basic,"This book is for the beginner genealogist. It tells you how to plan your research and what kind of computer equipment to have. It takes you step by step in certain websites. It is extremely boring, even for a genealogy book. I was hoping for more info on what is contained in individual websites, where to find certain types of documents and explantions of software available to the genealogist. It is great if you don't have a clue but if you can navigate the internet on your own, you don't need this book. I will use it occasionally but The Genealogy Sourcebook and The Source: A Guidebook of American Genealogy are much more in depth."
2,Yawn,"I've been researching my genealogy on the web for about a year now, and I'd already found everything included in this book. If you're a basic web surfer, and can use a search engine, don't bother with this book. I also found that it was very difficult to reference, and jumbled together both the excellent resource sites, as well as the ones that are pretty much useless. Spend your money on ""The Source"" it will be worth the extra investment."
3,Genealogy for DUMMIES,"I just started reading....and I think, perhaps I expected too much from it....will let you know when finished because for now NOT very helpful."
4,MTLOVER,"Price and service were very good. Book was listed as like new, but the front and back cover were bent and creased as though it had been handled very roughly.Other than that, very satisfied and will buy again."
5,You should get me.....,"I'm not going to lie.....this album became one of my favorites within days. Great variety of styles but still holding true to the CTC we all know and love. Definitly grab it....and if you get stuck on 3 favorite songs, remember to hit shuffle once in a while and your 3 favorite will become the entire album."
4,A Plea For Cordial Conversations Between Evangelical Scholars,"I had no idea that there were such spirited debates going on in the Evangelical Theological Society. But for the last five years, there has been vigorous discussion among Society members about God's foreknowledge. Does God know everything about the future, or does He only know some things as probabilities? Can God change His mind about the future?Some who have engaged in this debate have been less than charitable, and this concerns Darrell Bock. He wants to make it clear that evangelical scholars, of all people, should model compassionate and caring dialogue. We need to major on the majors and disagree agreeably on the minors (if we must disagree at all.)This is a good reminder and a good challenge from Dr. Darrell Bock."
3,a vehicle,"Telling the history of Albert Glock is a vehicle for 1) an understanding of the ideology behind archaeology in the Holy Land, 2) a broader explanation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. By looking at Glock's work and murder and running through the possible suspects, the reader can better understand the various groups in Palestine and Israel, how their interpretation of the archaeological record is influenced, and the difficulties of occupation and in particular of ""curfew"". It's an interesting trip, but more like a tour bus than a home stay."
5,Fascinating and compelling!,"A well-written, compelling account of the politics and various agendas of two centuries of archaeology in Palestine and Israel, as well as as a troubling and eye-opening study of social, political, and crime issues in Israel and the Occupied Territories in the '90s."
1,Author should have stuck to the Archaeology,"Caveat Emptor.The fascinating world of Albert Glock is wasted in this wretched display of ""yellow"" journalism. The first 25 pages tempt the reader with Glock's difficult and languid childhood. After chapter 3, the author loses perspective of his topic, instead providing us with a hackneyed description of Glock's revolutionary methods to find the Palestinian's common ancestors.Part two of ""Sacred"" squanders what could have been a fascinating study into the mind of the radical archaeologist. Instead we are presented with Fox's opinionated and, at times, churlish investigation of Glock's murder.If Fox remembered the Birzeit professor's suggestion that the ""answer lies in the archaeology"", than perhaps he would have foraged deeper into the cultural and intellectual historical influences that formed his eccentric archeological methods."
4,It had its moments,"I really enjoy this musical, but it isnt one of those that you can listen to 100 times and not listen to anything else in between. My objecion to it is the same as my objection to ""Jesus Christ Superstar""(which i also love) is that both have music that is stuck in the time it was writen. ""JCS""is so very 70's sometimes i cant stand it and the pop 80's rock that chess slips into in certian songs does the same thing. I still love the music and the story though. I just wanted to warn everyone if they really hate 80's music that they might not like this show."
2,This is NOT the version to get,"Instead get the newer, cheaper, and better-sounding Polydor release (see review there)."
3,Excellent material suffers from awful digital mastering,"The Polygram pressing of this recording is far superior in dynamic range than this *flat* RCA offering. CHESS is a whizbang, high concept musical that encapsulates the dark insanity of the Cold War into the madness of international chess competition. Tim Rice is at the height of his rapier-sharp lyrics, set against the music of the guys from ABBA. Michael (A Chorus Line) Bennett directed this libretto before his death and before Trevor Nunn, butchered the story for his tepid Broadway premier. Great performances by all here: especially Murray Head and Elaine Paige."
2,Very Average,"As a purchasing professional, I turned to this book to gain insight to new or advanced purchasing practices that might help me in my work and I was very enthusiastic about the book when I began reading it. Instead of new knowledge, I found repetitive stories about the mass production environments in the automotive and related industries. Although some new thoughts or ideas were presented, I did not feel as if this book taught me anything novel or cutting edge. It is simply a repeat of purchasing concepts that can be found in many other operations or supply chain books flavored with managerial buzz words and the self-glorifying personal success stories of the authors and the companies they work for. If you work in a job shop environment or for a small to medium size business, this book is virtually useless. If you are in a huge mass production environment with a large budget, it might be of some value, but my guess is that you would already be familiar with the concepts presented."
1,And where is the beef?,Based on an extensive research project this book promises a lot but delivers nothing. The first thing that you have to recognize is that there is hardly any structure at all. Repitions abound without adding any value. The style of writing is close to unbearable - they could have put the contents into a fourth of the pages. The cases are sketchy at best; they claim to offer best practices but are nothing new. The book tries to look into the future and puts forward a wildly speculative view of what the authors think lies ahead; again they do not offer a vision but describe the status quo in future tense. For people who like real satire I recommend Moody's Harley Davidson poem! Summary: Only recommended for those who need to own every book on the subject...
2,"Lots of words, little content","Ifyou are looking for a ""how to"" book, look somewhere else. This book appears to have only general rules of the thumbs , wrapped in lots of manager lingo (people resource allocation, globalization, etc.) Overal very disapointing. The only positive side are the occasional industry examples, but there are not enough of them to make this book a good buy."
1,How the Top Ten Companies Shouldn't Manage Their Chains,"As a senior management exec, I'd have to say that this book was of no help at all. Although it has helped the supposed top ten companies with purchasing, I have used a completely different strategy using simple purchasing techniques. I suggest you read, ""Managing and Purchasing Problem Solvers"" by Jonathan T. Monczka. This book is much more efficent describing management principles clearly. I do not reccomend ""The Purchasing Machine"" at all."
1,Disappointed,"I thought these shoes were so adorable! I usually wear a 7, 7-1/2, or 8 so I ordered the 8 first (so I could wear with a thin sock) -- way too big. Since half sizes weren't available I thought I would try the 7 next and it was way too small. Waiting anxiously for two shipments and having to process two returns was very frustrating."
5,"Well made, comfortable, cute shoe","I had been looking for a good, comfy, cute pair of brown mary-janes for close to a year now since my favorite pair broke down early last Spring. I had bought several and returned them because they didn't look as cute on my feet or in person as they did online or they just were not comfortable (I want to walk everywhere in NYC in them). Finally, I purchased these shoes, and am really happy. They fit just as my size should; they are very comfortable (especially after a little wearing in), and are very cute. The only caveats I have are that I don't love the 2 straps (which is just me, not a problem with the shoe) and that the leather itself is a little odd - kind of bumpy. But, overall, these are minor issues and I am a big fan of my new mary-janes. I have already worn them over much of NYC and am very happy."
4,great shoe,very well made sturdy shoe and it looks cute too! I would highly recommend these shoes for someone who is on their feet all day it does run a bit big on the size but a good pair of socks solved that problem for me
1,These benches don't ship well -,"I don't know if it's the packing or what but my bench was damaged in several places, including broken iron supports. Box was severely damaged and no hardware was in the box. My guess is that it fell out during shipping. I think it's worth the extra price to get from your local home improvement store and not have to deal with having to return the damaged item. Please note I did not buy off Amazon but it was the same item and the reviews on that seller's site were pretty much the same. Damaged and missing hardware."
1,Worst bench available... no wonder it's so cheap.,"Shipped the first time without complete parts. Was shipped a second time in a tattered box and the rod iron parts were actually broken in pieces.I was going to try one more time, but the customer service told me they were going to discontinue the item due to so many problems with this product and refunded me my money."
2,waste,"I bought this bench for my porch. It looked beautiful and was a little sturdy when we first bought it, but after a couple of years it fell apart. I wouldn't spend too much on something like this because it won't last."
1,20Q Handheld Game,I can't tell you how this even works - I never received instructions with it. I did ask the seller for instructions and I never got a reply.
2,These run small,"I have to wear a narrow width, and bought two pair of these in narrow, along with other narrow Clarks. I agree that this style runs small, and I, too, would have ordered up 1/2-1 size if I had known. Both pair gave me blisters."
2,Flimsy,"I'm giving this two stars mostly based on the fact that it is innovative, and I love new and different toys... But...I got this for my 10 year old son for his birthday. First day out of the box, it broke... have to replace the wings already. This toy is NOT durable at all. I was really hoping this would be great fun, but it's turned out to be a major hassle/disappointment."
1,Do not Buy,It is a dirty coloured liquid with hardly any scent. I am highly disappointed as this was a Christmas gift for my mother
2,just didn't like,"I thought that I would give this fragrance a try. I don't have much luck with fragrances, must be my body chemistry. But again, this did not smell good on me at all, but fortunately the fragrance does not last long so I did not offend anyone else."
5,Adequate production. Magnificent singing.,"The main characters look somewhat too old without proper stage makeup. Alvarez's voice is mesmerizing. Gallardo-Domas's singing is beautiful, but her acting is not that convincing. Hong is great, stunning as Musetta. The staging and costuming are nicely done, nothing special though."
1,Sonic gopher repellant doesn't repel gophers,I do not recommend this product. It has been in the ground for 2 or 3 weeks and fresh gopher mounds are appearing within 10 feet of the spike in the ground. The spikes continue to emit annoying noises (at least to humans!) but they do not appear to repel gophers.
1,Wish it worked,When I received this product it looked solid enough except for a bit of rusting on one of the contacts on the inside of the device. But upon putting the batteries in and trying to turn it on found out that it does not work so I am returning this.
5,A must-read for any aspiring novelist,"I have read many tips from writers, but I have never read a book like 'Chapter after Chapter'. It wasn't only motivating, inspiring, and helpful, but also a very entertaining read. With the aid of the book and it's helpful tips on the writing process and the novel writing process, I was able to finish my first novel after years of trying to write one. I would strongly, strongly recommend any aspiring novelist to read this book. I keep it like a little bible and look back on it once in a while to absorb the advice and insight it has given me. Thank you, Heather, for this wonderful work."
2,A regrettable purchase,"I wanted to like this book - really I did, and not just because I also bought Page After Page at the same time and I have to read it too.But I don't like it. I'm on Chapter 12 and I'm fed up with the hectoring, lecturing tone. I'm irritated by the voice from the mountain, the 'successful' writer who feels justified in telling the rest of us what we're doing wrong.If you're looking for a book that'll encourage you and make you feel like writing, you might want to look elsewhere. This one's all about what you're doing wrong. You're whining, wasting your time, not putting enough into it, trying too hard, taking yourself too seriously, not taking your writing seriously enough, whatever. You just don't have what it takes, and Heather Sellers, evidently, does."
2,A Guide to Prayer For All Who Seek God,I bought A Guide to Prayer For All Who Seek God to give as a gift. When I received it from Amazon.com it had a white sticker on the back that left an unsightly sticky mess when I removed it. I've had to go to another source for an acceptable book for the gift. I wasted $27.00 on the purchase.
4,Corelle Hoops Yellow Round Serving Platter 13-in.,"beautiful platter, nice shape and size, heavy though, not what we are use to with Corelle"
5,Very pleased,I bought it for the price and must admit I was pleasently surprised by its performance. It has been working flawlessly and its data extraction speed is amazing. I also bought a CDRW from the same company and they work fine together. Installtion was a snap.I highly recommend it.Michael
3,Dont expect too much,"This DVD player is great for its low price but dont expect to get too much out of it. It runs nicely with new movies, but as soon as there are a couple of scratches on the DVD, the player starts to skip and sometimes even refuses to play. No matter how many times you try to start it up again or try again it just doesnt work. Another problem is if you watch one movie right after another, then the player just wont play the second movie. Overall, if you plan to use it sporadically its a nice cheap buy, but if you want to use a DVD player extensively youre better off spending the extra money to buy a better DVD player from a more respectable company"
4,One of the best race games so far,This game has everything you would expect from a need for speed series game and more. Graphics is mind blowing in HD cars look awsome game play is great only con I have with the game is that it some times freezes it doesnt do it to often its not my xbox it could be defaults in the disk but other then that its a great game to own.
5,Great game,I love this game. The graphics are great with highly detailed cars and i am still using my standard tv as i don't have my hdtv hooked up yet. The story is pretty good and the cop chases are awesome. Busting through the road blocks and piling up police cars is a really fun aspect to this game. It is fairly challenging overall.
4,good condition but...,Got it in like a week my fiance has been playing it he loves it but it wont play after awhile he has two guys left to beat andit freezes on the loading screen.
3,The Fast and the Facetious,"This game is not as pretty as PGR 3, but I chose it over the aforementioned anyway due to the ability to customize the rides. That's about all this game has going for it, because after cracking the top five on the blacklist, it became nearly impossible to drum up enough bounty without using cheesy tricks. What do you have when this happens? Boring game play. Get PGR3 instead. The animations are smoother, the game is more beautiful, and you can spend more time racing rather than trying to get the cops to chase you long enough to earn a shot at the next contender."
4,Need for Speed Most Wanted,I choose it because it was up to every expectation I intended on it being. The only problem I have is that it's not a continuous story mode.
2,Product received was not product advertised.,"Received Platinum Hits Version, not the version pictured above. There are key differences in both the gameplay and box art."
4,Great fun,"This game is great fun. After spending hours playingNeed for Speed Underground, this was a great change.Not only do you have great build kits, new music, and excellent car handling. Now you will increase your skills by having to evade the cops. It is a lot of fun and filled with action."
5,"Incredible graphics, great variety in gameplay and tons of fun.","This game is incredible for an early launch title. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is full of variety and has great multiplayer engine as well. If you have any interest in racing games, this is a must have title of the early xbox titles. So far the only negative that I have for this game is the hours of time is takes away from my life :-)"
3,fun for the couch patater,So i picked up NFSMW this week at my local EB. and so far i really like it. it is very fun so far. although the dialogue is pretty lame. as everyone knows you start with a kick ass car then in a pink slip race you lose your car (because Razor sabotageded your car) then you start at the bottom and have to work your way up the blacklist to get your car back.customizing is very cool. the paint colors and body kits etc...to bad i only have a damn vw golf though its very pimped out though so farmy main beef with the game is that the cars handle so weird. i guess im not used to the NFS series. its fun but the handling is so weird and too forgiving in many aspects.it takes the challenge..ie some fun out of the game. its more of a casual gamers game. also when you start off at the bottom your stock car will kick everythings ass.fun game so far ill beat it eventually...i have to many 360 games right now and not enough time
3,Not as good as people say,"The game is alright I guess. I have to say though, I've played every racing game out to date on the x-box 360, and nothing beats Full Auto."
1,Waste of money - Premature bulb failure,Waste of good money. In less than nine months three of these bulbs already died. We used them for a couple of hours in the evening during the week and a bit longer on weekends. They didn't come close to the thousands of hours advertised.
5,Step stool,"This stool was more than expected, very well constructed , love the way the steps pull out from the underside of the stool. I would highly recommend this stool to anyone looking for a nice looking piece of furniture for the kitchen or dining room area of your home . This product is a must for anyone who has to climb up to reach a tall cabinet, very sturdy ."
5,Cosco Retro Chair/Step Stool,"I love it. I was so glad to finally be able to find a replacement for the previous two, which my husband ruined by using them for painting, etc. I am short - 5'1"" - and it is just the right size for me; I have back trouble, and it really relieves my back to be able to sit while cooking and baking. Maybe now I will be able to do more of both! I can also climb up safely a short distance to retrieve or put something away on a higher shelf than I could otherwise reach. Thank you for making this available."
2,My expectations were too high.,"Cosco hasn't impressed me with this step stool. For the money, quality is the one thing I expected... Its more like a mini high chair for children."
3,too small,"I owned a Cosco stool previous to this one which I had for many, many years. So when I was ready to purchase a new one I returned to the Cosco brand expecting to receive the same quality product I had in the past. My main disappointment is that the chair it so small it would be hard for a normal sized adult to sit on and be comfortable. Also mine arrived with a small rip in the vinyl on the seat at one of the corners. I wish they had not sacrificed size and quality for price since the older products lasted 20 years or longer."
1,Cosco Counter Chair Step Stool,"The service and delivery of this product were excellent. However, the backrest was damaged. The plastic was coming away from the metal. It was as though there was not enough ""seam"" allowance. The company promptly replaced the chair twice (we now have three) and both of the replacements have exactly the same problem! We gave up."
4,Cosco White Step Stool,"This step stool was not very difficult to put together at all. I read some reviews prior to purchasing it, and they were correct that you have to remove the seat to screw on the back. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't that hard to do. I gave this as a gift to my friend and she absolutely loves it."
5,Great transitional high chair,We got this for our daughter at 17 mos. We have it at our counter so she can use this chair instead of climbing up on our bar stools. She still needs to be supervised but it is alot safer and more stable than anything else we could find. OK 2012 update: Our daughter is now almost 8 years old. We still use the chair and it is still highly functional as a step stool and extra seating. I wouldn't do white again since it is a bit stained from all the use but I'd definitely buy this product again.
5,Cosco Chair/Step stool,"Bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law, she saw mine and wanted one just like it. Great product; works as a chair most of the time and a sturdy step stool when needed."
4,Fantastic,"My mother needed a step stool and chair for working in the kitchen. This totally fit the bill. It was simple to assemble. I wish there were more color selections but the white works for mom. Also, the white versus the red has a better system for getting the steps out."
3,This is a very flimsy step stool,"I liked it was shipped quickly. I did not like that when it arrived partially assembled and had to take apart in order to put the back of the seat on. The step stool part is not level and I don't feel comfortable, but because I am not one to return because I won't spend any more money on a product I am sorry I purchased."
4,Cosco step stool,"The Cosco step stool was delivered as promised, in perfect conditiion, exactly as advertised. I'm very pleased with the product and the service, and would not hesitate to order from this company again."
4,2nd one,"The 1st one was for my mother & she would not do without it.The 2nd one is for her friend that saw my mother's & then wanted one.The 1st came assembled from a different source. The second one, from Amazon, I had to assemble the back rest to the frame. It would have gone very smoothly had I known the hardware was metric not English. My 3/8 socket fit on a couple of the nuts but not on others. You need a 10mm socket or wrench & a good #2 Phillips screwdriver.Be sure to mind which end of the box to open 1st. It's marked. If you use a box cutter on the wrong end, you will slit the seat.Shipment was fast."
2,cute but not too sturdy,Hace been looking for a chair with fold down steps to reach things in overhead cabinets. Found this one and it's alright but seems a little wobbly and it was a nightmare to put together. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,My search is over,My search is over. I have been looking for this chair for years. I remember having one when I was a child and loved it (except when it was the time-out chair). Great gift to self. Now my 8 year old insistes on using it instead of the barstools.
2,not as expectedI,"I wanted this for my kitchen because I remember there being one in several kitchens in my childhood and thot they were so neat and useful. I guess when they started manufacturing them in CHINA quality went out the porthole!!! Cheap materials, steps are not spaced out well enuf (tripping hazard) and you have to take the seat off to put the backrest on, then reinstall the seat! I would return it but dont have the money for the postage. I will just use it as it is. Thank God I am not a heavy person! I dont think it would safely hold anyone over 150#."
2,SOLID STEP STOOL,AFTER ASSEMBLY THE CHAIR IS GOOD AND STURDY. THE ISSUE IS YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE SEAT OFF TO ATTACH THE BACK REST. THE BACK REST DISTORTS THE FRAME AFTER ATTACHED SO THAT THE SEAT DOESN'T LINE UP ANY MORE TO PUT THE SCREWS BACK IN. IF YOU ATTACH THE SEAT AGAIN FIRST THEN THE BACK REST SCREWS CANNOT BE PUT IN. A NIGHTMARE!
4,brilliant production,"Outstanding production from the Staatsoper in Vienna. Gruberova and Popp opera singers and it shows. The production is very traditionel and all the better for it. The thirs act, although it is inventive, could do with cutting, but I presume the audience expected a 3 hour visit.Highly recommended"
4,For the second act only,"le deuxième acte est à mourir de rire : Gruberova est une star en Allemagne, et surtout à Vienne en Autriche. Sa faon de chanter ""Mein Herr Marquis"" n'a jamais eu d'équivalent. Dernièrement, elle s'est attaquée à tout le bel canto italien, allant mme chanter ""I Puritani"" à Barcelone devant un public sidéré. Dans ""Fledermauss"" elle est entourée par la crème des germaniques : Bernd Weikl, Lucia Popp et Fassbänder.Un age d'or que le DVD permet de conserver pour tous ceux qui aiment l'opérette viennoise."
5,"The Best ""Bat"" Yet!","This delightful Die Fledermaus is by far the most outstanding production currently available. The extraordinary cast never disappoints; their voices are superb, and their joy of performance is evident throughout the opera. Equally pleasing is the excellent technical quality of the DVD."
5,Perfect production,I loved this video and Feldermaus is always a delight. The cast is perfect and the final act with Frosh is very funny without going overboard. The singing is excellect and the acting is also just what is needed. Buy it!
4,Smooth as Scotch,"Salvatore Calabrese has complied a stylish and helpful cocktail book. The drink facts are fascinating and the pictures are top quality. Of course you get drink recipes and instructions on how to make them, but it is presented in a way that even if you never prepare one drink from the book, it is worth a look."
1,Cheap Price Cheaply Made,"You get what you pay for and I didn't pay much. The seam ripped out when I was trying to put it on. My receipt from Amazon said to contact the distributor, when I called them they were snotty and told me to call Amazon. I ended up sewing them up myself, if they hold up from this point I would gladly give them four stars...or maybe I deserve four stars."
5,Funny and educational!!!!,Putton Wages War On The Rude Golfer was hilarious. I also learned a ton about golf etiquette. This video is perfect for anyone who wants to brush up or learn golf etiquette in a fun way. And there are some very pretty girls in the video as well. I especially liked the dream sequence.
4,My first book on Writing Fiction,"This is a great resource, albeit a little heave, that teaches you the basics of fiction writing. I own a hard-copy of the book and it was the book that got me started writing and thinking about all the different parts of fiction. If you're a beginning writer, this is a book that you should get since it talks about the basics of fiction writing and provides practical exercises to get the writer writing. The ebook version is clean and easy to get through."
4,Fiction Writers Workshop,"The info about fiction writing was new to me. The book was helpful, but I needed a beginners lesson first. I would recommend this book to anyone who is currently working to improve their writing."
4,Fiction Writer's Workshop - a worthwhile read for a beginning writer,"Fiction Writer's WorkshopThis book presents more humanistic, less aggressively ""punchy"" guidelines for the beginning writer, probably because the author is Central European.The discussions ramble compared to American-authored writing guides, but for the reader who seeks a way to build literature out of impressions and experiences, this is the kind of slow, introspective work s/he might like. There are probably too many exercises per topic, but it's worth picking out one or two out of each chapter and following it up."
4,"Helpful, but not as practical as his other book...","Novakovich is a master teacher, and this book is fine for some things, but I think he's really at his masterful best when he's dispensing practical exercises, rather than extensive theoretical background.For sparking my own fiction, I much preferred his ""Writing Fiction Step by Step"", which takes you in a much more practical direction towards creating finished pieces."
3,In between,"This is a very good beginner book and still helpful to the intermediate, but it is not one I would recommend for the pros. It is a faster pace than say the series Elements of Fiction. It does cover just about everything in fiction; though it's coverage is a little shallow. All in all I am glad I bought the book, and I think I will be referring back to it sometimes, though it is not the jewel of my collection. My favorite is Self Editing for Fiction Writers I think you should get that whether you are pro or beginner."
4,a different perspective,"I haven't seen the original Anatomy so I had no expectations for this movie. That being said, I really enjoyed it. It is mostly action with very little gore. The opening sequence is great but the film is best viewed as commentary on the horrible pressure doctors and interns face each day. It's an extreme example of the consequences of obsession and ambition. The message of the movie is that even the best intentions from the most caring profession can end in mayhem when taken too far.If that doesn't convince you--- HOT GERMAN ACTORS GETTING IT ON!!!"
4,Run Lola Run...Run For Your Life,"German actress Franka Pontente from Run Lola Run and the first Anatomy movie is back once again, and she is still running. I enjoyed the film, athough I must admit I enjoyed the first Anatomy better. Twenty minutes into the film, I was wondering where is Franka?? I was getting a little bored before Franka appeared on-screen. She doesn't show up until later, but she is worth the wait. However, this time, she is an investigator, and not the novice student she was in the first film. The setting of the movie is a Berlin hospital, and once again, we see a medical program that has gone awry. The murder scenes are just as potent as the first movie. And as always, it was good to see Franka again, whom I think is very...very...talented. If I had to compare her to an American actress, she definitely reminds me of Clair Danes. Although the first Anatomy was better, you will still enjoy this movie and be on the edge of your seat."
2,Anatomy 2,"This Anatomy sequel wasn't bad i didn't see the whole movie, so i cant say it it was good or bad."
5,Brilliant show.,"Truely Tim Rice's words have the power on musical shows. I like ""florence quits"" and ""I know him so well"" most, and all other songs. ""I know him so well"" actually represents his puzzle relationship with Elaine Paige. Well, you can feel his vlnerable and charming. I love them both."
5,This is tied three ways for my all-time favorite Musicals,"Phantom of the Opera Little Shop of Horrors Chess Those are the top three. Get this CD. It has some of the most beautiful songs on it. Everybody mentions Nobody's Side and One Night in Bangkok, but they seem to forget I Know Him So Well, Heaven Help My Heart and No Contest. The music is brilliant, the lyrics are heart-tugging, and the show is memorable. I had never listened to a bit of it, but a friend loved it so I bought it. Never Never regretted it."
3,"What about Josh Groban singing ""Anthem"" in the musical Chess?","Has Josh Groban ever sang on a musical CD production of Chess? I know he sang the song ""Anthem"" from Chess on one of his albums......."
3,The Anthem Rocks!,My favorite song in this recording is: The Anthem. The singer is amazing and blows my mind with his powerhouse performance. The rest of the recording is good but not as excellent as the Broadway cast starring Judy Kuhn.
3,More like 3.9 Stars...,"This musical is great, the music really shows the direction of musicals of the time. The show is sprinkled with great songs for both male and female singers. I would strongly suggest this CD to anyone who likes musicals. Its a shame this show isnt performed more. All that being said, there are a few moments when the music is kind of a drag, but I think its worth working through those moments. Favorite Song: ""Where I Want To Be"" & ""One Night in Bangkok"""
5,"When it comes to Musicals ""I prefer CHESS, keep listening my friends""!","First let me qualify my comments by saying I am not a big fan of musicals. Having said that I like ""My Fair Lady"" and this one ""CHESS"". I can't play chess for squat.... but I LOVE this musical. Its the original and I like it better then the Broadway version. However the Broadway version seams to enunciate the lyrics better. The voices of the singers on this original can't be beat. EXTREMELY WELL DONE Kudos to Benny and those that helped! I highly recommend it!I don't often listen to Musicals but when I do I prefer CHESS. Keep listening my Friends!"
4,Still the best recording.,"The used discs arrived in good condition and in a timely manner: everything was as advertised.This is still the best recording of the musical Chess. This recording was certainly done while Chess was a work in progress, and that is evidenced by the mixed styles from operatic numbers to rock riffs: sometime in the same track. The story is also a little tough to follow in this recording, but reading the insert alleviates that problem well.In no other recording are the characters and voices so genuine. The heart and passion of each singer is used to great effect in developing their characters such that you end up empathizing with each and every one. To me, that is the point.I recommend this recording."
1,Avoid this edition!,"This is a terrible, unproofed scan that nobody should pay a red cent for. Shame on the people who put it up for sale!"
4,Pre-Superstardom,"Despite the quick-cut editing, which is more and more commmon these days and really isn't too bad here, this live-concert DVD is a superb look at the experience that was a Radiohead show just prior to their rise to superstardom. The audio is quite good and the setlist, comprised mostly of songs from ""Pablo Honey"" and ""The Bends,"" is rockin'. I never thought too much of ""Pablo Honey"" until I saw this DVD, which caused me to revisit ""Pablo Honey."" VERY glad I did!"
5,Radiohead in fine format the Astoria,"Radiohead live at the Astoria is a mindblowing moment in time caught before world-wide fame found the band. This performance is now some 11 years old and finds the band touring in support of the as yet released ""The Bends"". Being a long time fan of the band myself I found this disc to be like a breath of fresh air- a reminder of why the band is so talented and so original. While later works have become experimental it is easy to see here on this DVD that when they choose to offer staight forward rock, Radiohead is head and shoulders above those who have tried to follow (Coldplay). I highly recommend this release for any Radiohead fan."
2,Babyzi,"I like Radiohead music but this DVD's quality is very poor. The image and sound quality kills the work. The color is very bright, the sound is louder and noisier than it should be. The stage has poor especial effects overall. It seems the concert was a debut and not very well planned. I am disappointed and upset with this purchase. I don't recommend it to anyone."
5,"""Elephant have right of way""","Loved this book!! Great story, and great lessons within the stories! This book does not get old! I recommend it to anyone. I gave this one away as a gift and they received it on time and it was in good condition, and they loved the story!"
5,at age 58,"at age 58 this book is extremely relevant, now, and in the future, having read ram dass't books, listened to ram dass in person, and having listened to his tapes this book sends me thorough the roof, this book is timeless wisdom, to much wisdom for just one reading. At omega instutute ram dass sat at a table with me for breakfast and i asked ram dass about going to india and doing service work, his reply was do not invite the elephant trainer unless you have room for the elephant, my recommendation is make room for the elephant."
4,Ram Dass: Still Here and Kicking!,"Long a fan of Ram Dass' writings, I found his book on aging was like a comforting talk with a familiar old friend. His gentle and common style is a sympathetic hug from someone who has truly walked the walk after his stroke and onwards through his own aging process. For a generation of independents, he tackles the nearly-inevitable dependence we will have on those who come to care for us. The issues are anything but simple, but he treats them with realism and a sense that though we, too, will encounter some of these experiences as we age, we can face the challenges with grace and confidence. Thank you, Ram Dass."
4,wry wisdom for budding geezers,"ram dass presents us with another good book of counter culture wisdom and insight. while not up to the standard of some of his previous works, it yet contains much wisdom both spiritual and secular for those like me ""of a certain age"". the first half of the book meanders a bit but the last few chapters are worth the wait. his philosophy is mainly derived from Vedanta, and therefore timeless and often profound. he is one of the few true american hippy holy men and is always a pleasure to read and learn from. if you are getting older, heh heh, you will enjoy and benefit from this insightful look at aging. i'm glad ram dass is ""still here."""
2,Don't care for it.,This was recommended to me by a friend. I didn't get much out of it. I didn't finish it. Gave it to the library.
3,The audio version- Sorry I didn't think the reader fit the book,"This review only refers to the audio version. I must say that the book ""Still Here"" is WONDERFUL and has inspiring information on the personal journey of Ram Dass before and after his stroke...or as he would say-""he was stroked."" Once you read the book version I recommend seeing the documentary ""Fierce Grace"". Keep in mind that the only reason I gave this a low rating was because the reader didn't match the spirit of Ram Dass!!"
3,Ram Dass Still Here,"A Good review of the teachings over the lifetime of Ram Dass, helps to refocus on things you thought you knew and reevaluate."
2,In all fairness . . .,"In all fairness, I'm 4/5ths of the way through the book . . . but I think I can give somewhat of a review. Ram Dass, Ram Dass, Ram Dass, Ram Dass - that name alone, I'd always heard of him but had only read one article. So I bought the book. The absolutely best thing about the book is the title and his name. What else is contained??? Well, highly-intelligent and incredibly charismatic Dass needs a ghost writer and a good editor. It's just . . . huh? over and over again. Especially when I got to the part where he was in Hawaii and a spiritual group had him on the ground screaming about his mother's lack of full attention to him when he was around 4. Huh????? This guy needs to get back to India instead of writing flat books."
1,Poor Sound Quality,This product arrived on time. But the quality of the sound was very poor. I returned this item and have not recieved a refund yet. I would not order this item again. EVER
4,That is Some Good Sondheim,"This recording is one of the better ones. The only bad thing is that some of the ter tracks, mainly on the third disc, are taken from the origianl boradway cast recording. Otherwise, the other songs are great. There is an added bonus on the last track of the third disc with Sondheim himself singing ""Old Friends"" with Angela Landsbury."
3,A mixed bag of Sondheim goodies,"A Collector's Sondheim is a mixed bag, containing a few surprising and effective pieces but, for the most part, consisting of material drawn from one or two revues that contained less than definitive performances. The best surprise is the previously unreleased track of Lee Remick's ""There Won't Be Trumpets."" She does a wonderful job with this number. Too bad she didn't have an opportunity to do it on Broadway. Her performance on the original cast album of ""Anyone Can Whistle"" is a delight, often overlooked because of the slam-bang job Angela Lansbury delivers in her first Broadway musical. Less effective in this collector's collection is the version of ""I'm Still Here."" Yvonne De Carlo's original still is the best. The ""Happily Ever After"" number cut from Company is interesting as a curiosity but it cannot compare in quality to ""Being Alive,"" which ultimately took its place. So all in all, an interesting if not always satisfying CD."
3,okay for pancakes; skip the other baking options,"I've been through about 3 boxes of Insta-Bake and tried many of the recipes on the back. For pancakes, they're okay. I like feeding my kids whole wheat pancakes, but honestly I think Aunt Jemima makes a better whole wheat pancake mix product.As for the other recipes I've tried using Insta-bake, I've been disappointed every time. The biscuits are flat, hard, dry little pucks. No one wanted them. I've tried a couple of times thinking maybe I just did something wrong. Nope; they're gross.The cookies I made were also awful. Yeah, maybe healthier than a tollhouse cookie but since I ended up tossing them out because, healthy or not, they STILL weren't worth the calories and at ANY rate, just tasted bad. For a good cookie made with whole wheat flour I make these cookies [...]Anyway, for pancakes, fine, but there are other options out there. Don't expect this product to be as versitle as Bisquick or Jiffy baking mix."
5,Excellent for apple cinnamon pancakes!,"this is a healthier alternative to bisquick. It uses whole wheat flour and other natural ingredients. I used it to make apple cinnamon pancakes, and they were fabulous! I'll let you know when I try it with my waffle iron."
5,nice :),I just got a yeallow tortex picks(6)they are good as they looked online.Just letting the buyers know all the 6 picks are in same color.I think they choose the colors in random. :))))
4,Must see film for young voters,"When released, this was the only film ever made about a Convention Delegate. Groundbreaking, it was shot in MTV style before MTV. Its the story of a young 21yr old girl DELEGATE to the 1972 Republican Convention in Miami. It covers the process from San Francisco, Sacramento to Miami Beach. Many famous people are in the exclusive footage in this film including Ronald Reagen, Pat Nixon and Lenore Romney.The film received excellent reviews. 27 minutes of unforgetable footage.""Exceptionally good piece of work"" Encyclopedia Bririanna""Most Competent Work"" NBC NewsJohn Robert, producer/director"
3,Just gave this CD a twirl and ...,"I gotta say, it's not the best thing I've heard come from TEXAS. I'll admit , it definitely rocks but seems unoriginal somehow. #3 is the best song on this thing but I still can't stand the guys voice; It's not quite the voice for heavier rock music. OH WELL...maybe next time."
1,Not So Great,"While I liked this book better than the other Lant books I tried, I found that so much of Lant's information can be found for free on most good web sites. His books are big, but can be condensed into 1/2 the number of pages. Another thing about Lant's work is that unless you like pomposity, you may be turned off."
5,Have used and recommended this book many times,"Jeffrey Lant is an amazing guy ""who answers his own phone"" inCambridge, MA. He is the most generous teacher of businessbasics and advanced techniques that I know of...for any price.The complete novice/layman can learn to be their own publicist,and marketer most successfully with his books. He has writtena number of excellent business manuals. Its worth searchinghis site to learn more about him and what he teaches.He has helped my business succeed!"
2,bag broken,"Received box with fish food and lounger that I ordered. Unknown to me the fish food broke open and was loose inside the box...that wasn't the worse part-fine dust from the fish food leaked out of the box and was all over the lounger box as well as my kitchen counter and floor. The size of fish food was priced well compared to that available in this area, however, I don't think the clean up made it worth it."
3,Mom of two,"Although this game looks like fun, it was too hard for my 8 year old and 3 year old who are usually very, very good with computer games."
1,Awful,"This band is horrible, I have seen them live and heard the cd, this is non-thinking garbage. The vocals are immature and the music is repetative, I suggest don't buy this cd unless you use it as a coaster."
1,Untalanted....,"Just listen to the samples here. This is just not very good stuff. I love Ministry and the like, but this is like Kareoke Metal."
2,Define: Opposite of Fun,"DOA single player...The single player portion of this game is by far the WORST of any fighting game to date - unless of course you enjoy spending hours fighting against an AI that cannot be described in any way other than RIDICULOUS! Even on the 'normal' setting (the easiest available), the AI can counter at will and string together impossible combinations of hits. 45+ minutes on ONE opponent to unlock ONE costume... not my idea of a good time.The multi-player portion of the game would be a total blast if it wasn's constantly laggy and either booting people or freezing...With a couple of patches, this game COULD be awesome, but as it stands now - I recommend skipping it..."
1,Don't get this game...,"I wanted to get this game since I first heard about it, but 10 minutes into playing it I realized how boring the series has gotten. Not only that but the AI is VERY poorly done. The game doesn't offer much in the way of content; a few costumes here and there and a laggy and glitchy online mode. The story line is slim to none; they have you fight over a cabbage at a marketplace for instance. My advice to anyone who is on the fence about picking this title up would be to save your money for something better, this game will only frustrate you and become stale very very quickly. Of course if you're a fanboy of the DOA series you will get it and say it's the greatest thing to hit fighters. But if you're a casual gamer I caution you to avoid this title."
4,DOA4 awesome game!!!!,"Dead or Alive 4 is an awesome game. It provides entertainment for hours. After completing the story mode, which only took about a day or so.....there are challenges on LIVE...keeping you entertained by playing against people all over the world.There are only two problems I have found with the game. (1) After beating the story mode and unlocking all of the characters, the game deleted by progress, causing all my characters to disappear. Team Ninja is supposed to be putting out a patch to fix this. (2) When playing on LIVE there is alot of times the game will freeze....when it plays, it is awesome, but when it freezes, the only way to get out of it is wait for about 5-10 minutes or exit LIVE and go back in.I highly recommend this game.....it reminds me alot of my favorite game of all time, Tekken.....but the moves are better!"
4,My fingers hurt!,"Yes it's frustrating at times but I think the majority of the issues were patched and corrected. I'm not a young man anymore and my reflexes are not what they were but I didn't have much difficulty progressing in the game. The game is beautiful even though the game is now ""old"". Content wise it's your standard fare for a fighter. Good game overall .. I would have to disagree with everyone saying the game is too hard."
3,Huge disappointment,"I used to love DoA. I played all the games from the first one on up. Admittedly, I am not very good, but with enough practice and determination, I was able to unlock everything in all the other games.I was severely disappointed, in this game. The graphics are really not that much better than DoAU, the new characters are lame, the unlockables for each character are limited (Remember DoAU, with 14+ costumes for most characters? Try 6-8, in this game), and the actual in-game fighting mechanic is way too unbalanced for anyone not completely devoted to this franchise to get into. And, don't get me started on the final boss (Who, unlike in past games, can't be avoided by playing Time-Attack, rather than Story mode).I'm going back to DoAU."
5,Best Graphics Ever,"I love DOA, Now this game isnt much differnt than any of the other DOA's the only real difference is the fact yopu can play as a spartan (halo dude) and it has amazing graphics, this game has the best graphics out of all the games out for the xbox 360 a definate MUST HAVE"
1,good looks is deceiving,"If you want to have fun don not buy this game is just like ninja gaiden, HARD!!!!!!!!!!!! if you want just good looks this is the game"
3,team ninja does it again.,"first off i will say dead or alive 4 has a nice look graphics looks crisp and clean, beautiful game. however like other team ninja games (ninja gaiden)doa4 suffers from a lack of an easy option i am so sick and tired of playing these games that's almost impossible to beat. to team ninja is putting an easy option on your games such a problem. $60 per game and $400 for the system can't team ninja and xbox cut me some slack please thank you. three stars for the look of the game's graphics but game play and anything else are like doa ultimate on the regular xbox no real big change."
1,Run away and just say no!,A tech demo at best. The blocking mechanic is completely broken.I felt cheated after buying this game.
1,WOW... what a waste of great graphix,"I got this game in a bundle with my xbox 360... I will have to say that I would never have bought this off the shelf and for good reason. This is a great example of how a company can throw some of the best graphix out there into a complete pile of crap. The game has less content to it then the first street fighter, online play is a complete joke, and the controls are extremely sloppy. Not only would i recommend not buying this game, I would recommend breaking or burning it if you got it in some package."
1,Worse Fighting Game I have Ever Played,This is one of the worst games I have ever played just don't waste your money.
3,Vintage Chieftains,"Vintage Chieftains. Not one of their ""great"" albums, but still good to round out a collection of their historical Gaelic works. Worth the price."
2,looks cheap,"I have purchased the jewelry before and I was very disappointed with the overall quality and appearance. This jewelry looks cheap and the quality is very poor. I would definitely suggest you not get this ring. In fact, I ordered the ring and gave them to my granddaughter."
1,genuine green jade,"it was beautiful when I received . but when I wear first day it broken , that was very dispointed."
1,These glasses clouded and I had to throw away....,"I was very disappointed that after a few washings, only one of which was in the dishwasher, these glasses became horribly clouded. The cloudiness completely marred the brightness of the design and colors, and consequently I threw them away. A shame and a waste because the rooster image is quite cheery."
2,glasswear,"I was disappointed with this order. I think that influenced my decision. I ordered three sets and only received three individial glasses. Talked to amazon rep. This time I received one set. Then they refunded rest of money as glasses were no longer available. This is the first disappointment I have had with amazon order . The glasses were acrylic, which I knew when I ordered, but was disappointed with weight.."
3,"Works as described, batteries were dead","product included dead batteries that flashed the light weakly but didn't control my projector. Upon replacing batteries it worked well. remote is definitely a generic knockoff as the construction / look feels cheap, but it does it's job."
3,"Un buen libro, aunque no grandioso","Este es un libro que muestra el absurdo de la existencia, la muerte de la inocencia y del idealismo: el darse cuenta y la angustia inherente de la realidad sin adornos idealizados. Esto suena interesante, pero en sí la novela es un tanto cansona para leer, las descripciones rayan en el surrealismo y las situaciones son absurdas. Por ejemplo, la esposa del protagonista muere porque en sus pulmones crece un nenufar. Aun así, si te gusta la tragicomedia, el humor negro, las situaciones absurdas y maravillosas, el simbolismo y el existencialismo, esta novela es para tí. Ah, y si sabes quien es Jean Paul Sartre, vas a disfrutar su caricatura- referencia omnipresente en la obra-, Jean Sol Partre."
5,Stunningly good...,"I have to share the other reviewer's enthusiasm, this stuff works amazingly well! I had the absolute worst shaving bump problem. After using this stuff for a few weeks, all gone! Now I use it all the time, I have tried so many other products nothing comes close to this stuff."
4,overqualified,"This book is full of information, with a catch. It is like a hundred years old! and has never been updated. To sharpen chisels, it recommends a three foot diameter grinding wheel set in the ground. good for traditionalists."
3,Old fashion text book,This book is somewhat outdated. Don't purhcase it if you are planning to learn wood carving from it.It is however an interesting reading and will provide some usefull information.
3,Carving,"You have to be really motivated to glean the information in this book. While a lot of information is there, the print is small and the illustrations for actually learning how to do the process are few. You must have a learning style that accepts mostly words to describe three dimensional concepts."
4,okay i bought it,"This one's a grip. It's still watching kids dance but this ones has hundreds of kids rockin on. It's rebellious in a way but who wasn't ? This one has a high quality casing. This is something dancers, djs and producers wanted. This one's way long too, so you get the footage you deserve. International Style Hip Hoppin'. Still questionable though why people act the way they do in it."
4,low carb chocholate!,"This product is very tasty, you do have to limit your intake to two pieces, as the sugar form used can cause you to develop gas - so spread your consumption out! Otherwise - enjoy!!"
4,Great book!,"This book is a lucid, up-to-date and comprehensive reference for theory and practical matters surrounding our two most viable alternate energy sources. Be careful though because the first edition has a few typographical errors, one or two in its derivations."
5,Nerf Showtime Basketball Hoops,My 9 year old son received this for Christmas and absolutely loves it. It keeps the kids entertained for hours. He likes the fact that it has a drink dispenser and he can hook up his IPOD. My only complaint is that is it very big and takes up alot of space in his room.
4,Great Toy,"I bought this item for my 10 year old when I noticed it on sale for $100 with free shipping. Don't think it's worth $200 + that it normally is when you include shipping.Anyway, he loves it. It is rather large and sturdy for an indoor unit. You have to put on lowest height to play indoors unless you have high ceilings. It has been on my back deck since Christmas, which makes it much more fun to play because of all the additional room. One warning though, if you don't fill the plastic base with water, it can blow over and break. To make it easier to move around, we didn't add the water. It is sturdy enough to do so, but gusty winds blew it over and the wired platic rim shattered- so now I need a replacement part.The additional features of ipod connection, talking backboard, lights, adjustable height, etc. really make it a fun basketball set up."
5,Seven year old grandson loves this toy,"This game is so much fun. You can set the number of players, so you can use it with a group of friends. My seven-year old grandson liked this better than all of his other Christmas presents. He even called to say ""thank you."" He spends hours playing with this. I've played with him and I even like the announcer. One caution, you need a high ceiling in the room where you set this up."
5,Great,My son recieved the Nerf Showtunes Basketball game for Christmas. We set it up in the basement so it is a wonderful activity for winter. The boys love all the various games you can play on it. My son also likes hooking his ipod up to it. It is great!
5,My Son LOVES This - Plays all day and Night!,"My son has not stopped playing with this toy since xmas! I am actually glad that I purchased it! It was easy to assemble, I did it alone while my husband slept. My son is 9 and has had 4 friends come over to play a game in his room. I have had to endure a lot of noise, but he is having a ball. The ball ""Nerf"" that it comes with is soft and you can't bounce it. The plastic covering came off the ball after one of his rough games with friends, but he is still able to use it. Right now it just looks like a orange foam ball. This is a GREAT BUY! You won't regret it!"
5,One of the Best Children's Books Around!,"I think this is an excellent way to present the Titanic story to children. The story is told from Polar's point of view which helps to hold the children's attention. I am an elementary education major and I just read this book in one of my classes at my university for a project. I read it with the Titanic Suite playing in the background. I do not think one classmate of mine blinked during my entire presentation. This book is also wonderful for children because it does not focus on the devastation of the Titanic voyage, but rather the joyous times between a bear, his master, and his family."
5,Polar the Titanic Bear,I liked the story because when Polar was lost he was reunited with his owner at the end of the story. The person that read me the story said that this story was true because the granddaughter of Polar's owner found this story in her attic and wrote a book about it.
2,Good content but poorly edited and hard on the eyes.,"This is a thoughtful book with lots of useful information on intuition. The problem is that the print is so tiny, and I, being over 50 y.o., get eye strain trying to read it without a magnifying lens. There are also many typos, misspellings, misplaced commas, incomplete sentences, wrong grammar, etc., that it reads more like an unedited first draft than a finished product. The material is worthwhile but I wish it could be presented in a less physically painful format. Clearly, the publisher did not ""already know what to do"" with this text. If it were more readable, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars."
1,Disappointing,"Browse books by Lynn A. Robinson, Laura Day, Sonia Choquette, Marcia Emery, Rosemary Ellen Guiley and Judee Gee before buying this book."
1,Save Your Money,"The title is not Zen, it refers to... Intuition. The book is about how to develop it. If you like doing endless exercises and keeping a journal, this book is for you. I found no value at all in this work, and very little information, despite the author's PhD claim and a lot of quotes by more famous authors. The theme of this book is a series of exercises designed to improve the reader's ""Intuition"".There are many valuable, useful books in the self-help category on the market today that deserve recognition and praise (such as ""Happiness Is a Choice"" by Barry Neil Kaufman). This book is not one of them."
2,Trite business jargon,"This book is full of the trite business jargon you get from fad business books. Worn-out cliches, pithy anecdotes, cutesy anagrams...it's got them all. Siess' intended audience is the lone librarian in a small library, and there is certainly information here that can help. However, to get to it you have to dig through a great deal of business-guru garbage. She meant well, it just comes across silly."
3,Bad DVD of a Great Movie,"I'm giving it three stars because at least it is on DVD. But this DVD transfer is just as terrible as all the other reviewers warned me about. It was inexpensive, and there were plenty of warnings to me of just how bad it would be, so I'm not in pain or anguish over this tragedy. I wish they had put just a tiny bit of effort into making this DVD though.Watching the first few painful minutes of terrible color and blurry images made me think I should now spend the $40 for the German Blu Ray import just so I can see the movie for real again. I'll have to borrow or buy a Blu Ray player too."
4,Even more bizarre than a David Lynch film.,This movie was very stimulating. Visually alluring. The plot thickens with every turn. It was like watching a Dali painting come to life and then turning into a work by Munch.
4,If Edward Hopper Had Made a Movie,"This film is worth watching if you like stunning visuals and film as a visual art medium. There is some really beautiful cinematography that makes great use of light and dark imagery turning this film into a modern baroque with its use of highly potent symbolism. The Reflecting Skin is a movie meant to be reflected upon. In the Reflecting Skin Philip Ridley explores a different aspect of themes found in ""Passion of Darkly Noon"" - the gap between fundamentalist faith teachings and the power of human frailties, this time in the context of the post atomic changes in American society."
1,No Redeeming Qualities,"Not even Viggo Mortensen's good looks could save this movie. It is a rambling story played out in scenes that are barely glued together. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I like off-key, quirky films, but this was painful to watch. Do not waste your time or money. It was not even good enough of a film to lull me to sleep. Run far, run fast."
5,one of the best child actors<> since ricky schroder,One of my NOW favorite movies.Had me on edgethe whole time
1,Avoid this film at all costs,This is by far the worst film I have ever seen. The director should never be allowed to make another film again. Every night I pray to have the memory of this lousy waste of celluloid erased from my brain. Truly the standard against which bad movies should be measured.
1,keeping my VHS,Due to the warnings of those who have seen this DVD I am keeping my VHS tape of this but am wondering why DVD maker do these things.
1,reflecting skin,If you have lost all movement from the neck down and the CD with this movie is only movie laying close enough to your lips to be able to grasp and then painstakingly manipulate into your computer leaving you just enough energy to still be able to press 'play' with your tongue- it may (or may not...) have been a better choice than simply staring at your ceiling (which you have memorized every inch of).
3,A Tepid Attempt,"An appealing concept that has been gorgeously filmed, ""Reflecting Skin"" manages to fall far short of remarkable. While I appreciated the film's attempt to show us how evil might be perceived through the eyes of a child, I found the notably poor acting of the children (and much of the rest of the cast) to be immensely distracting. The few moments of brilliance are overshadowed by all the clumsiness that sews them together. Instead of finding the performances to be quirkily Lynchian as other reviewers have suggested, they struck me instead as being just plain bad. While I certainly would recommend this film as being worth seeing if you have absolutely nothing else on your list of things to do, I can't in good conscience offer it anything higher than a 3 out of 5 stars."
1,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,"Pretentious camerawork, glacial pacing, bad acting, a plot that makes no sense and a world view that might politely be described as hateful make this the film equivalent of plutonium. Out of several thousand films I've seen from various countries in every genre, this is quite possibly the most loathesome and infuriating I've yet encountered. If you're looking for something different, it definitely is that; however, don't watch when depressed--it could possibly persuade a viewer to end it all."
4,"A complex light, slowly setting on simplicity...","I found the reflecting skin to be a film that inches forward as it unfolds before the eye, only to reveal what one does not need to see in one's life...Nothing! Then slowly it folds back up again, always reflecting back upon itself the contents it has shown. The darkest parts of a child's life are the parts that are empty, the parts that one goes to and is alone, the parts that reflect an existence that bears no hope. The prairie, the soul, the house, the box are just containers of memories that when left to reflect off of human skin, they fall short in their quest for life. Maybe this is the point, children use their imagination for far greater purposes than adults. They use it to create lives where otherwise there is none. This movie, the reflecting skin, is a fragmented ""meta-reality"" that focuses so intently on nothing that it can only achieve its intentions...life to death, anyway it can. As long as that way does not taint the word ""Art."""
1,Ryanallie1,"I bought this Gray Colored Hose to use strickley for our RV. To clean the Black Tank Dump Hose when finished. Its a hose, rather cheaply made. I don't think it will last for a very long time. But its cheap, and easy to replace."
3,Wrong Item!,"I ordered a CD that I was going to give my dad for father's day; however, they sent me the wrong CD!!! Then when I notified them that they had sent me the wrong one, they told me the one I had originally ordered was out of stock! Anyway, they screwed up, but at least they sent me a return envelope with postage pretty quickly and then refunded me as soon as they received their item back. So, they screwed up, but at least didn't give me a hard time about giving me my money back. I'll never order from them again though."
3,Shy of immortal,"3 1/2Classic rock fans should surely enjoy this easy going, multi-influenced slice of blossoming psych-prog-blues, even if a constant mustiness keeps much of the material frozen in time, though a few tracks are well written enough to avoid dated aesthetics"
3,A Salty Dog,I bought this album for two cuts and that's what I got. I'd forgotton that unless you really like the group most groups will only have one or two good songs and the rest is filler. An entire album of great cuts is really rare.
5,Superior,Procol Harum's masterpiece. Very few albums have the quality and consistent concept that they achieved here.
5,The Best book for your workshop,"This book has made the woodworking experience much eaiser. The shop fixtures, jigs, and tip are a must for every woodworker."
3,More of the Same,"This disc should be issued to a movie soundtrack. It certainly sounds like TV or movie music. Arkenstone is a competent song writer but he has run out of fresh musical ideas. When you crank out album after album under Troika, with ex-wife Diane, and under his own title, things become a bit stale. I know he needs to pay the bills like we all do, but give it a little rest for awhile. It has been a few years since I have heard a fresh idea. I can hear many of the same chord progressions repeated from past albums. Time for a clean slate of music."
3,Predictable New-Age Symphonic Excursion,"My initial response to this album was disappointing in the music I was expecting to hear according to the glowing reviews posted for this album previously. Absent was the rendering of any striking point-counterpoint or development of any counter-balanced (or unbalanced) sub elements within this new-age symphonic blend. Arkenstone has utilized the requisite synthesizer mix along with his symphonic scoring to a attain a level of mere mediocrity. Almost all of the passages take the expected course with a primary melody and predicted harmony that rarely varies off the track. Mildly interesting but without any real wallop, there's no blistering inspirational passages that one might expect from an illusory and fantastical subject such as Atlantis. Predictably and unfortunately only a notch above Muzak. Got a CD for sale that's been played twice!"
5,absolutely stunning!,"Several months ago, I stumbled onto David Arkenstone's music through this album. When my copy of the CD came, I was immediately enthralled with its music and became an instant DA fan. Since that time, I've bought many of DA's other albums (all of which are very good), but this one has remained one of my favorites. In my opinion, Atlantis is one of Arkenstone's most inspired albums; its music comes alive and will fill your living room or car with beauty. It's one of my favorite CDs to pop into my car stereo, and it keeps me motivated when I'm grading essays. Any CD that can accomplish that is truly inspired!"
3,"Good, but not very innovative","Having appreciated DA for a great many years now, I almost find this album disappointing. It is the same DA I have always enjoyed, and therein lies the problem; this album sounds like his old stuff redone, which for some is fine , but for others distances him from artists like Rush and Jethro Tull who remake themselves with each new album."
5,Universal Culture Shock/Undiscovered Numbers & Colors/Foreign Objects,"I really like the CD it is very good. And i was looking forward to getting it, it was an item i really wanted. But anyway The CD is very good and i like it. Your time on getting it here was good."
5,Nicer than the vet supplied one,Our vet unit hardly made it a week. This one is much more flexible and forgiving and so far will seem to last much longer.
4,Christy's Choice,"I have been a Christy fan for some time and I was hoping that this book would be more about ""David or Neil"" but the book leaned more toward ""Ashville or Cutter Gap"". However this was still a great and exciting book in all respects and I recommend it highly."
5,I Liked,"This book so much helped me understand the ironical and paradoxical situation of operation gatekeeper in such globalized, and multi cultural country like the U.S. This book offers the readers various ways such as historical, political, social and cultural perspectives to look at and think about the truth of relationship between Mexican immigrants and U.S. government and the factual background in which the operation gatekeeper has been generated. And it also lets you understand how this policy influenced the whole world in terms of globalization or internationalization and also the geographical and economic aspects. I'd recommend this book because Nevin's work in this book was tremendously brilliant and remarkable."
4,Fun flick saves itself killing Seagal...,"I'm sure any die-hard action fan is well aware of Steven Seagal's early death in this film, so I won't mention it again. Kurt Russell plays a CIA analyst a la the Jack Ryan films and he also knows how to fly, which comes in handy at the end, but nevermind. The plot concerns a group of terrorists hijacking an airplane to land in Washington DC and detonate a deadly bomb. Probably not the best choice of viewing after 9-11, but it's pretty exciting and has some good humor. There's plenty of suspense to keep the viewer interested."
4,Great action film...,"How can anyone not like a young Halle Berry, Kurt Russell, a 747 hijacked at 30,000 feet and oh yeah Steven Seagal killed. You gotta love it."
4,Shocking with Disbelief,"Great rescue mission! One comment. Should Americans reveal the whole world through this movie our strategies and secrets in countering terrorism on a hijacked airliner? More than a rated R movie, Executive Decision should be banned by viewers in parts of the world were terrorism is rampant. Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining and enjoyable because of the plot of the rescue is one of its kind especially the shocking landing of the ill 747 in a small community airport after series of explosions from collision to collision with small aircrafts. Nerve gas on board did not even react to the explosions after counter terrorists contained it. Seems that everyone on board survived the landing. A happy ending. And Halle Berry! hmmmm great eye shadow and mascara."
4,"Very Good, But Could've Been Better","This movie was pretty good. I was disappointed when Steven Segal died before anything REALLY good happened. if you like movies that are all action, you might like this one, but it is mostly tactical army stuff throughout, with about 15-20 minutes of action at the end. if you like Kurt Russell, than you would probably like this one."
3,Exciting Action Movie,Good action with some unique elements. See if you can spot Hercule Poirot and anticipate the fate of Steven Segal!!
4,Very cool movie,"This movie starts out strange. Steven Segal is in the movie, then is killed off early. Then Russell & his team start up and the movie catches fire. Great action sequences."
3,"Great soundtrack, ok movie",David Suchet ( pre-Hercule Poirot) is as usual excellent as the movie's villain. Oliver Platt is also good. Kurt Russell does a decent job. Steven Sagall is wooden. The plot is passable. The Jerry Goldsmith score is the best part of the movie.
4,I liked it!,"This was a good film. It immediately caught me off guard as Stven Segal was killed off in the first action scene. Although I don't dislike Segal and his acting this movie was probably better off without him. This is the first action film I have seen Kurt Russell in since Brackdraft and Stargate, and I always forget just how wonderful he doed in this type of film.The story line is a bit far-fetched as far as the rescue goes. I don't see hooking up to a commercial jet-liner with a stealth via a cloth-like tube in mid-air probable. I guess if anyone could find a way to make it happen it would be the military with these types of tools, but I just don't think it would happen. If it did it probably wouldn't come off as well as it did. If you can get past that you should enjoy the film however."
5,Kurt is the best!,"While a lot of reviewers took exception to Seagal being in the movie at all. He may or may not be their cup of tea! I think the movies were he gets to demonstrate his abilities in self defense are great! I don't really care what happens backstage, whether he was killed off because of attitude or not! I watched the movie because of the Russell and Seagal! You can find hundreds of thousands of women just as, or better looking than Halle Berry! You reviewers would think it would have been great if Hilton, Spears or any other high priced woman of the night were to be in the movie. Your only looking for that moment when you can see something that the edit room missed anyway!"
1,"Not Widescreen! Excellent movie, however.","Not widescreen!!! The back of the DVD states: ""Widescreen version presented in a ""matted"" widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition enhanced for widescreen TVs."" What does that mean? It's a load of double-speak. The DVD is NOT widescreen. It's 100% full screen. If you're looking for widescreen, as I am, you might consider those double features (two DVDs for the price of one) that were released in the last 3-5 years. I believe those are widescreen-- but I'll find out soon enough!NOT WIDESCREEN"
4,"DON'T BE AFRAID BOYS, DADDY'S BACK !","If AIR FORCE ONE deceived you as much as it deceived me, EXECUTIVE DECISION is the movie for you. Faster, less politically correct, it's a little pearl to add to your ""action"" DVD collection.And don't be afraid of the mention of the name of Steven SEAGAL in the credits ; the real star of the movie is Kurt RUSSELL. He becomes the new father of the anti-terrorist group after the departure of SEAGAL. Father is not an inadequate word : observe that the group desperately needs a Daddy to lead them. In fact, one of the boys curiously spend the whole movie lying in bed and weeping, just like a little baby.A DVD to buy if you're an action movie fan."
3,Executive Decision [Blu-ray] - Not the Original Version,I watched it knowing they removed some scenes but you really cannot tell at all. The movie seemed to flow just fine without those scenes. I have the DVD with the original movie version. It’s one of my favorite movies. I just wanted it in Blu-Ray so no complaints here; well one complaint I wish there were some special features. So removed one star for cutting the scenes and another star for no special features.
3,Interesting Action movie without the leading action star,"This was a good movie and Kurt Russell did a great job in his role. I was disappointed that Steven Seagal was killed about 20 minutes into the movie, but if he hadn't, the movie would have been over in another 20 minutes as he would have retaken the plane in no time, all the bad guys were weak in comparison.This was the most realistic depliction of trying to board an in-flight hijacked plane I have ever seen, it's not something and just sky-diving onto a plane. The truth is you would probably kill everyone on board trying.The terrorist were just a bit too sophisticated for real life though. Come on, who creates a bomb that is too difficult to disarm on a plane where you are very unlikely to find a bomb squad around.Good movie, great to watch once, but not worth the space in the library."
4,GREAT sdbut by Baird!,"Editor Baird made a great debut in direction. Good acting, good cast, good scrit, good action-thriller. Russell is always amazing, nothing new here. But Seagal's name in the credits fools the public, because he dies in the first 20 minutes."
3,Not Enough Action,"Enjoyed the film especially the casting but where is the action? I don't like ""action"" movies without action. There is some suspense though. The cast is great with everyone from David Suchet (Poirot) playing a villain to Leguizamo, Berry and Steven Seagal who gets ousted in the first few minutes."
1,Overlong and underdramatic,"""Executive Decision"" promises to be a fast and glossy big-budget aerial adventure. However, even the special effects were not as impressive as expected. The last reel was a disappointing misfire. The script was poor and unmemorable. The performances were appalling and the plot was tedious and unsuspenseful, not to mention implausible. The impregnation of the jumbo jet by the stealth is strictly fantastic. And why should the terrorists go through all the trouble of hijacking a plane in order to detonate the DZ-5 over Washington? Shouldn't they have quietly shipped it in a crate and and activated it, thus taking the Americans by surprise? And the scene at the beginning, showing Kurt Russell taking flying lessons anticipates the ending oh-so-predictably! But there is one major plot twist, in the first twenty minutes, that will jolt unsuspecting viewers out of their seats..."
4,All-out flight,"It's no wonder in real life airline travel ever winds up like it did in ""Executive Decision"" For a midair transfer from a modified F-117 stealth fighter to a clumsy Boeing 747 jetliner (in which makes Steven Seagal's appearance short-lived) and Kurt Russel trying to save a plane filled with 400 passengers from a deadly bacteria bomb from entering the United States. The ending of the movie was excellent. Halley Barry who plays a fearless flight attendant helps Kurt to catch his man. Plenty of technological gizmos, and safeguards for the bomb."
3,Executive Decision Review,Disc wasn't cracked or broken and played okay on my disc player so I guess I would say no initial problems were found with it.
4,"A bit long, but very good.","Max Lucado may not be the best theologian out there, but when it comes to turning out a heart-warming story he knows how to hit the mark. Another great book by Lucado on Christmas."
2,Good for small wires,"Wire cutters arrived yesterday, broke today on first use. Tried cutting a wire that didn't seem that thick, however cutter broke before wire did. I'm guessing for thin wires, this is probably good. Non-thin wires, look elsewhere."
3,&#51204;&#49440; &#52964;&#53552;...,&#51204;&#49440; &#52964;&#53552;&#51032; &#50857;&#46020; &#51060;&#51648;&#47564; &#53356;&#44172; &#50416;&#51076;&#49464;&#44032; &#51080;&#50612; &#48372;&#51060;&#51648; &#50506;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.&#53945;&#55176; &#44405;&#51008; &#51204;&#49440;&#51060;&#45208; &#44592;&#53440; &#47932;&#52404;&#47484; &#51208;&#45800;&#54624;&#46412;&#45716; &#48324;&#47196;&#51060;&#45348;&#50836;.&#46608; &#44032;&#45140; &#45216;&#45180;&#47532; &#47582;&#47932;&#47140;&#49436; &#51096; &#45796;&#47932;&#50612; &#51648;&#51648;&#46020; &#50506;&#45348;&#50836;.
4,Gets the job done,"Purchased this wire cutter/stripper for speaker wire. It does get dull pretty fast but served its purpose. Would recommend for anyone who wants to do small jobs around the house, but not for a professional."
4,Handy for Small Jobs,"I bought this tool for a small addition to my tool bag. The day after it came in I already found a use for it and was glad that I made the purchase. The only things that I could complain about are that the grips open very very wide due to being spring loaded. If you have to adjust your grip, the tool might slip out of your hands. This isn't a big deal though, I got used to using it right away. There is an adjustment wheel for stripping different gauge wire. If this is not set back to the lowest setting after use, then the tool will not lock shut because it prevents the tool from closing all the way. Not a big deal though, just something to keep in mind.I have used similar style strippers supplied by my school for engineering projects, but Irwin is definitely of a higher quality. If you are a handy person that doesn't need to overspend on a special stripper/crimper then buy this."
2,OK- But Not Top-Notch,"Arrived, colorful and plastic-encased. Looked good. but oozed some lubricant at every joint. In my experience (40+ yrs) a *good* tool of this nature works w/o lube.Find another wire stripper."
2,Flimsy,I got this shirt because it looked different than any other patriots shirt...This is a very thin shirt and runs VERY small. I usually wear a 2x and got that size and it didn't fit. I gave it to my daughter who is a large/xlarge.
5,The original Thomas!,"Not to knock any of the subsequent Thomas videos, but this is the best, closest to the great stories written by Rev. Awdry. I specifically sought this out to be viewed while reading the stories to my child...it really brings 'm to life! Ringo Starr is the best narrator out there for the Thomas stories...all these other actors 'n such can't hold a candle to him. A MUST if you like Thomas!"
4,A little dissapointing,"When I got this for Christmas from my dad, we were really excited about this because we both are old Thomas fans and having them rerelease the old episodes when Starr narrated was what we had been waiting for. However, we were slightly let down.Instead of the DVD bonus disk being filled with tons of things about the old series all we found were a few games and this commemtary buy Sir Topham Hatt. We were expecting things like, the making of the first Thomas episode or an interview with Ringo Starr about being the first series narrater. Now I know that wouldn't be very fun for a 5 year old, but for older Thomas fans and for parants it would be interesting and cool to see. The episodes however are a great value and have there original Railway Series names.This was a very good DVD. My only wish is that they had put more commemorative things on the bonus features. Find the most obvious answer is not the best way to commemorate Thomas' First Season."
3,Good but may not be best for American audiences,"Good solid episodes and stories, but just not as lively as current PBS episodes. Not sure these early recordings are the best match for American audiences. Would recommend buying episodes with another commentator. I just did, despite having bought thsi 3-disc early collection set.Overall, highly recommend Thomas the train--just not this collection set."
4,An Unexpected Favorite!,"I picked this CD up at a thrift store on a whim. I had never heard of the band and had no way of knowing whether I'd like it or not. I was pleasantly surprised. They have a unique sound, which is hard to describe. Almost like a mixture of Jars of Clay, Goo Goo Dolls, and several other bands. You know what, I'm horrible at descriptions. All I can say is I would highly recommend checking this CD out. My favorite tracks are ""Color in Your Gray"" and ""One More Stop""."
3,LOOKS CHEAP...,"I BOUGHT THESE FOR DRIVING AND THEY DO HALF THE JOB...THEY DON'T REALLY BLOCK OUT GLARE AS I EXPECTED THEM TO DO...IT'S GOOD FOR DRIVING, NOT AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY ENHANCE VISIBILITY..BUT DURING DAYTIME IT REALLY HELPS YOUR EYES RELAX.CHEAP LOOKING IS WHAT I NOTICED.. LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE THAT YOU CAN BUY AT ALI EXPRESS... FOR 5$..I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT."
4,Flying Fisherman Maverick Polarized Sunglasses,"I'll admit the frames are obviously not the highest grade of materials. For luxury frames, you'll need to spend a few more dollars. But, these frames are very lightweight and quite comfortable. What impresses me most is the quality of the polarized lenses. These are the real thing! The clarity is remarkable and I now realize that ""polarized"" lenses in drugstore sunglasses are inferior. After only a few seconds in bright sunlight, I honestly cannot tell I'm even wearing them. They deliver a literally flawless field of view and provide crisp image definition. I can only hope they remain unscratched, because I really feel like I scored with this purchase!"
4,Lightweight Polarised Sunglasses.,The sunglasses are light weight and wrapped around your eyes.Polarized lenses reduce the glare tremendously and suitable for sunny and normal days.Great to use polarized glasses during driving or cycling.Great value for the price!
3,HUUUUUGGGGEEEEE for my face,I have a fairly average sized head.And these glasses are made for giants (big heads)There is no way to adjust them for a better fit.Will most probably return them.
3,nice protection,"this is a super confortable ultra protective pair of glases, but mines have one litle truble I just get it today an they look amazing, but when I put it on, the first time, they broke from the right side under the suport that holds the glass. but when you are unsing them you cant see the defect, but other people do. so that's why I'm giving 3 stars. maybe is bad luck, I been waiting for so long. maybe i try whit other pair later."
2,sun,The lenses are not very good..distort the vision..the frame itself seems to be made well but it is the lenses that give it a poor product review
5,Absolutley perfect!,"These sunglasses are perfect. The give a nice yellow tint which is exactly what I wanted and then fit very snug, not uncomfortable, which makes them a great fit. You cannot beat them for the price."
4,Excellent quality and value glasses,"I cycle 15mi round trip to and from work. I'm using these as cycling glasses.Inexpensive, well made, good tint and polarization. I like them a lot. They do not look like $200 glasses, that's okay. Glasses are failry large. I'm 6'3"" and they fit well.The frame is fairly beefy and sits against the eyebrows. The lens sits in front of the frame and is vented. This prevents fogging and prevents sweat and such getting on the lens as easily. It does not provide as good wind protection as closer-fitting glasses, but I have not found it objecitonable. It is the best overall balance I have found betwene protection and ventilation.Minor complaint is the frame is bulky enough it slightly obscures the top line of vision. This is not objectionable in normal use, but when crouched in riding position, looking through the top of the glasses, is a bit more noticeable.Great buy, highly recommended. I will get a set in Clear for night riding as well."
4,Feel cheap but work great,Pros- Lightweight- Block dem harmful rays- Not too dark- Fairly inexpensive- Lenses have a good shape that doesn't allow light in at any angleCons- The arms more slap to the side of your head rather than bending behind your ears- Feel pretty cheap
3,Decent glasses,"I bought these glasses to be used for yard work, with spinning lawnmower and weed wacker blades, plus a leaf blower getting particles in my eyes. These glasses do the trick in terms of protection; nice, big lenses, comfortable fit. However, they're certainly cheap glasses, like those you'd find at the point of sale in a drug store. I'm happy with the value, although I don't expect these to last me all that long."
2,A little big,"Like another reviewer, these glasses were a little too big for my average sized head. I ended up returning these."
4,its good more stars to be,the freedom that sterling had in the early years is being taken away by the network in this season. They were forced to lose any anti war anti atomic themes.
5,LOVE this episode,"I see so many bad comments and disapointments over this episode of The Twilight Zone ""The Bewitchin' Pool"". I do admit, it could of been arranged a bit better. I still love it. It touches my heart. Such a sweet fantasy for any child who ever felt unloved or unwanted in the real world. I watch it any time, I feel sad. Always brings back memories and gives me hope."
3,June Foray (Uncredited),"Interestingly, whenever Sport is in the country with Aunt T, her voice is dubbed over by June Foray, who is uncredited. She is better known as Rocky the flying squirrel!"
5,IS THIS THE LAST ONE???,"I THINK THAT THE THING THAT SCARES ME THE MOST IS THAT THIS MAY BE THE LAST SEASON. THE FIRST FIVE DISC'S OF SEASON 5 CONTAIN THE USUAL TWILIGHT ZONE EPISODES. BUT DISC SIX ""SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL,"" GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS. I WON'T GIVE AWAY THE BEGINNING, BUT AS ODD AS IT MAY APPEAR OF AN INTRODUCTION FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET, I THINK THAT ROD WOULD HAVE REALLY APPRECIATED IT. MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS HOW DISTASTFUL TO MAKE A MOCKERY OUT OF SOMEONES DEATH, BUT AS YOU KEEP WATCHING THE REST OF STORY, YOU START TO GET A DEEP INSIGHT INTO ROD SERLING. AND YOU JUST KIND OF KNOW THAT ROD WOULD HAVE APPROVED. EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE OTHER TWILIGHT ZONE DEFINITIVE EDISION SEASONS, YOU MUST GET THIS ONE."
3,Season 4 Twilight Zone,"The switch to an hour-long program made these episodes cumbersome and boring. It was slow-moving and seemed to suffer the same problem as hour-long episodes of 'The Other Limit', 25 minutes of substance stretched over 50 minutes. Least favorite season of Twilight Zone."
4,Groovelicious,"Super-funky groovelicious. If you like Robert Walter, Jimmy Smith, Galactic, and/or the Meters, this disc is for you. Sugarman Three provide a raw, tight sound that when on the system, you can’t help but shake yo (...)– I dare you to keep still"
4,It's the nice.,"If you like The Meters, funky R&B/soul, than you'll like Sugarman Three. Good party music."
5,Great!!!,Martin Hengel is a scholar of the highest quality. He is careful in phrasing his ideas so as to be exact. I rate him as high as possible in terms of his ability to explain precisely his ideas. Each sentence carries the impact of a paragraph from some other writers.
5,Wonderful History Lesson.,Excellent series of books. Great history lesson. Read all the books in this series. I learned so much about early church history.
5,"""Rehoboth"" by Angela Elwell Hunt","""Rehoboth"" is the 4th book in the Keepers of the Ring Series. Historically accurate, this series has captured my attention. The characters are totally believable, their struggles heartrending. This series is so well written, it places the reader in the time, the place and event as it happens."
5,A very good book by a great man!,From beginning to end this book is a must read for anyone interested in helicopters and helicopter warfare! Some good photos too!jim
2,Disappointed,It has some nice pictures. Plenty of guys in Cavalry hats. But I really got very little idea on what they did in Vietnam and the battles they fought. I gather they were pretty important but the book told me little.
4,A Good Book,I enjoyed this book a lot. The mystery was fresh and kept me guessing. I liked the characters a good deal. I am certainly interested in the sequel and I absolutely recommend this book.
5,Still Life with Murder,"I believe P.B Ryan may have just become one of my new favorite authors. Her characters, in particularly Nell Sweeney, were very life-like and believable. The story was one that reached out and grabbed my attention fron the very first page. I found myself unable to put the story down. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mystery. The twist and turns will have you guessing, and then reguessing right up to the final page. I also loved the fact that the heroine was strong-willed and quick witted, and though she had a background she wanted to keep hidden, there was a touch of innocence about her still. A very good read!"
4,Good characters make a good book!,"This was one of the few books I found truly un-putdownable in some time. I finished it over an afternoon and had a good fun time. A lot of others have given a good background on the book, so I will not mention it here. The mystery was not too much of a head scratcher and you could see how things were going to progress a mile away but the detail and good characterization held my interest. It was more than worth my while.Being a kindle freebie was just the cherry on top of the cake!"
4,still life with murder,Started out great then soared to the middle sagged a little then picked up once again to leave me a little dissapointed at the ending. Never the less I enjoyed the book and more than likely will read another by this author. Marshall Dell
5,Simply Amazing!!,"Patricia Ryan has captivated me. This book is simply outstanding! I had to force myself to put it down each night, so as not to rush through and miss any points. The characters are made flesh and rise from the page. The plot is captivating and the attention to historical detail is wondorous. I can not recommend this book enough. I have passed it on to all my friends, and we all anxiously await the second installment. If you love historical mysteries you can not go wrong!"
3,Okay,"While there was nothing really wrong with this book, it was hard for me to get through. I couldn't really warm up to the characters, but that is just my read on it."
5,Excellent Book From Beginning to End,"I got this book for the kindle, for free. It was a quick and wonderful read. P.B. Ryan did an excellent job in giving enough description of the people and places without going over board and giving to much detail. I will be buying the other 5 books in this series."
5,strong woman,Great first book in an engrossing serial story. Quite the strong heronine. Story draws you in and makes you NEED to read the rest of the series.
4,"Original heroine, new territory for sleuthing","The Nell Sweeney character is unlike any other I am familiar with,Irish-American, poor, yet like many sleuths she is clever and resourceful. I look forward to reading the next in a series featuring her. I am curious how long the authoress will keep the counterpoint Will Hewitt character who is drug addicted and damaged by his experiences in the Civil War. She also introduces other minor characters who may have untapped interesting secrets. All-in-all a good debut novel for serious readers who like short reads."
5,Dark Mystery in Victorian Boston,"I really loved this book. As someone fully enthralled with the Victorian era, I really was not disappointed. Ms. Ryan has certainly done her research. Nell may have some modern sensibilities, but I didn't think they were out of place here. Considering her background, her unique situation, she might very well have been one of the women (a few decades later) to bring about reforms for women. The dark horse, a flawed hero if ever there was one (or is he a hero at all?) is an accomplishment in characterisation. Complicated, dark, brooding, an addict, and yet we root for him as if he were one of our nearest and dearest. I found the solution to the mystery completely unexpected, the twists and turns breathtaking. I'm looking forward to reading all the books in this series. I haven't been able to put them down since I started just a few days ago. It's been a long time since I was hooked like this. Well done, Ms. Ryan! You have a fan in me."
5,great book,"i love reading books that are thrilling and entertaining but yet clean. this is a good book to read. once you read one, you will want to read more of the Sweeny series"
4,Nice book :-),Kept my attention. Fun to read about a different type of society then todays modern busy life. A different world that is for sure. The plot worked fine.
5,Grabbed Me and Held On,"This book is very well written with great characters, an evocative setting, and layers of story that intrigued me and pulled me in. I judge books as Don't-care-if-I-finish, Will-finish-when-it's-convenient, and Can't-wait-to-find-out-what-happens-next. This book is the latter type, where I actually looked forward to the next time I could read. It wasn't just the action, characters, or setting. It's good writing: scattering the clues judiciously and phrasing the narrative beautifully. Loved it!Peg Herring, author of the Simon & Elizabeth Mysteries"
5,Still Life With Murder (Nell Sweeney Mysteries (formerly Gilded Age Mysteries)),"I bought this book and it's sequel because of the low price, and I wanted a summer read. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the writing, the fast paced story, and the historical time period. I didn't think I would be intrigued by a 19th century story, but I could not put the book down--nor the second one. Now I can't wait to read the next 4. Too bad it will come to an end there. I plan on getting more books by P B Ryan since she is a fascinating writer."
3,first kindle reading,Just finished reading my first kindle novel. Download for free what a deal. Still Life is orginal and after reading several cia type political thrillers was a welcome variation. It's a little slow in the first half but comes on strong during the second half. Several twists towards the end. Take CareLee
3,Predictable,"I found this suspense/romance novel very predictable from the beginning. I gave it three stars because I am not a good judge of this type of book. My favorite genre is more intriguing suspence. I would not recommend this book to anyone I know. But, romance readers may enjoy the rags-to-riches heroine, and the setting in the late 1800's."
3,pleasant mystery,"The question that comes to mind is, ""how can there be more books in the series if the hotel is not to be notorious and shunned by the clientele."""
3,Disappointing but readable,"I started this book very determined to like it. On the plus side, it is pretty well written and there is a fair sense of character, time and place. On the minus side,the characters were given life by their story, not by their behavior. I felt there was a great deal of repetition, visits to the gong house, and it is entirely implausible that Nell would have been given the time of day by the police,Brahmin employer or not. Also the story is at times quite confusing, and doesn't really move along. I felt Nell had 21st century sensibilities squeezed into 19th century dress. Also, Wil is a caricature, about whom I really could not care less. So reluctantly, only a so-so review. I will read the next one as it might be better."
3,History mystery,Good book with civil war history as the background story. Some of the story predictable but surprise ending. Liked the descriptive writing and will read others in series.
3,Still Life with Murder,I found this story enjoyable . It gave an insight into life after the Civil War for returned soldiers and their families. It was an interesting insight to those times.
2,THUD!,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK IN THE BEGINNING, AN ORIGINAL PREMISE. THEN THE BOOK SAGGED FOR A WHILE. THE LAST THIRD WAS VERY GOOD BUT THE ENDING SEEMED TO THUD. I WILL GIVE IT A 2.5 AS I THINK IT WAS A GOOD PREMISE AND WELL WRITTEN"
3,Enjoyable but not memorable,Remember when you discovered Agatha Christie and you tore through all the Miss Marples? That is how you might find yourself feeling after reading about the mystery solving governess Nell. This was a very readable period mystery with good character development. Good enough to read the rest in the series and probably enjoy them also. A relaxing read for the mystery lover.
4,Still Life With Murder,"I have no idea what the title had to do with the book (don't rightly care, either). Excellent cozy mystery, well plotted, engaging characters, vivid descriptions. If you want to know how to write a character so that the character's backstory emerges without an info dump, but naturally through the actions and dialog, this is an excellent example.Yes, Nell is a bit too modern for the time and place. But so what? It was an enjoyable book and I'm going to read the rest of the series. Highly recommended."
3,"Murder in Boston, 1868","The time is the late 1860s Boston, the aftermath of the war between the states. Nell, a young Doctor's assistant with a sketchy past, finds herself in a wealthy household. When the eldest son who supposedly died in Andersonville, GA, turns up alive and accused of murder, Nell finds herself involved in solving the murder. The story includes great images of Boston in 1868, well drawn characters, and an engaging mystery. I enjoyed it very much. I received this free with my Kindle subscription."
4,Very much enjoyed.,"I have to admit that I very much enjoyed this series. Despite the fact that some of the premises particularly in the first book seemed unlikely (ie that a wealthy woman would hire a woman as a governess after briefly meeting her once) and that some serious proofreading for errors would be helpful, the stories drew me in and made me want to keep reading."
5,Great series,After reading a book in this series I could hardly wait for the next and was disappointed when the series ended.
3,Forgettable,"I was intrigued by the reviews, but felt rather disappointed. The plot is pedestrian and the characters never come to life."
3,Just a tad too modern for believability,"P.B. Ryan has done quite a lot of research and many of the descriptions of Civil War era Boston ring true. But Nell Sweeney, the main character, is supposed to be a reformed thief who spent 4 years as assistant/mistress to a doctor. How in just 4 years, while working for him, did she also manage to learn Latin and French, anatomy and very modern ideas about preserving evidence? I like the other characters in the book, and also in the second in the series. Their motivations and actions connect with their characters as well described. But Nell continues in the second book to be just a bit too modern and too insightful, even though the author allows her to jump to conclusions and be mistaken once in a while. I hate to suggest that an author 'dumb down' a female character, but at least be sure about the historic accuracy of important aspects of the plot, such as having cops look at blood splatters and such. That seems too scientific for 1860s policing."
4,Very good period mystery,"One of the 'gems' found in my free downloads and I've already put additional titles on my want list. Very individual, well developed characters, reasonable mystery and although I am not a historian, it seems to give a good sense of the era in which it takes place."
4,Interesting with good twist,"Thought I had it all figured out. That is untiil the end, when the author put a twist on it. Sneaky, if nothing else!!!"
3,This book is not trash,"Science fiction author Charles Platt has dreamed up a novel idea for handling the mammoth mountains of trash generated by our ever-affluent societies. In his future the garbage in loaded into ""blimps"" and towed and deposited upon one of the larger asteroids. A problem ensues when the inhabitants object to the ten-mile high deposit of earthly trash accumulation on their adopted ""home"". One solution is to split the asteroid: trash goes away and peace is restored to the inhabitants - of course there are complications.Although not a book I would recommend an environmentalist I did not trash it. It is an interesting story with a somewhat unbelievable premise."
5,What a book!,The author just continues to turn out these amazing books. Once again I found myself isolated from the world as I was engulfed in the Celtic Myth. This book is really a page turner and I strongly recommend it to anyone with imagination.
4,As a present,I bought this book and had it delivered as a present to an inmate I'm writing. He said there were many helpful tips in it and it boosted his spirit by looking forward to something good. Gave him hope in an almost hopeless situation.
5,Awesome Book!,Very informative and helpful for a college student like myself trying to compose a thesis paper on the effects of recidivism. Excellent!
4,"Practical, Common Sense Advice",My son has been back and forth to prison for 20 yr. + . I bought him this book and to my amazement he is reading it. He tells me about it all the time. It has given him some great food for thought. I hope he finishes it and refers to it in difficult times. He is going to share it with his Parole Officer.
2,UNSATISFIED,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A TUTORIAL BOOK; THIS ONE IS NOT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WASN'T THE ""HOW TO"" BOOK I WAS LOOKING FOR."
3,A good intro but there are better albums for serious fans,"The selections on this album appear to come from the 5-LP set of AAF Band air shots originally released in the early 1950s. It's a good overview of the incredible quality of music and range of styles which characterized the AAF Band. This is a worthwhile first album for anyone familiar with the Miller civilian orchestra who wanted to extend their knowledge to the AAF Band. Hearing the unusual mixture of swing, blues and light classics for which this orchestra is so properly famous will be a revelation for anyone who only thinks of Miller's music in terms of ""In the Mood"" and ""Chattanooga Choo Choo."" However, if you're already a collector of AAF material, I'd recommend one of the more extensive collections - for example, The Secret Recordings - which give an even better idea of this orchestra's breadth along with tantalizing hints of what might have followed, if only things had been a bit different that dark night in December 1944."
3,not as much fun,hey everyone!this game isn't as fun as all the others. It was really short. some of the puzzles are tricky though. I only neede 1 hint!! I really liked driving the car and playing Mini Golf
4,A adult and kid review.,"Easier then previous games therefore not as frustrating. Kids love the driving, raking in the money, and the fun games. Great for kids who get scaried as there is no violence or scary endings. They also enjoyed the prices and learned a little about the depression.As an adult, I got tired delivering telegrams until I realized I could stop when I wanted. Otherwise I enjoyed the game, especially the depression time."
3,Not as good as some of the others.,"I love Nancy Drew games and was looking forward to this one. It was okay but not as good as ones like, Curse of Blackmoor Manor or Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake, which are my favorites so far. Some of the puzzles, like the golf game and sewing were just plain dumb. If I wanted an arcade game I wouldn't being buying an adventure game. I did like the 1930's setting and the characters were okay but if this is your first experience with Nancy Drew games I would try Secret of the Scarlet Hand or one of the others I already mentioned."
2,A Disappointed Nancy Fan,"I'm 14 years old and I've been playing Nancy Drew games since #3 The Haunted Mansion, and they have always been exhilarating. The puzzles would be tough, but not annoying, and during the game you would always feel frightened at one point or another. Also, when they promised 20+ hours of play, they would mean it. I was disappointed when I finished the game after only 5 hours of play. When I told my mother this, she suggested I was just getting really good at playing the game and solving the puzzles. After reading these other reviews, I realize I am not alone in this time shortage matter. I just hope that the next game will have the actual amount of time, meaning more than 20 hours of play. If that means that it takes a little longer to come out, I will gladly wait."
3,Not as good as the others...,"This game only lasted about 6-7 hours for me, and is by far the shortest Nancy Drew game. The games usually take me about a week to finish, and this one took me not even two days of playing. The story isn't very interesting, and there is really only one location to explore. This is probobly why the game was so short! The puzzles are very easy, (senior detective level), and there isn't much dialogue either! I did like the ending though, it was a suprise! If you haven't played ""Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake"" or ""The Haunted Mansion"" yet, play those instead!"
3,"Fun, but way too easy.","I love the Nancy Drew games. This game was no exception. As usual, there was an interesting plot, great characters, and a suprising culprit. Unfortunately, I found this game way too easy. I finished this game in one afternoon. The final challenge was completely unsuspensful. Other than a lack of challenge, it was a fun game."
3,fun but slightly childish,"This game was fun to play however many parts of it are childish, however few children would be able to solve the puzzles. The puzzles in the first part of the game are simple but some of them towards the end are impossible without the walkthrough. I would still suggest this this to adventure gamers, the format is simple to use and easy to follow."
3,a bit disappointed,"Very short!Not enough places to explore!Since Nancy solved the puzzle in one day, I think she would have felt it was also to short.I'm looking forward to the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew game in September."
2,Swell....not,"I am a HUGE Nancy Drew game fan. I've played all the games, and was really escited to get this one. I had sooo much fun playing it...for two hours. And then the game was over. I was shell-shocked. All of the other Nancy Drew games took me 1-5 days and a big headache they were so difficult. But this one was so easy! This did not live up to my expectations at all. It was fun, yes. But if you are prepared to spend $20.00 on a game that will take you two hours to finish, then buy it. If you dont, save your self ten bucks and go see a movie that will entertain more than this game. Which is just about anything."
2,Not the best at all,"I was really excited about this game when I heard it was going to be set in the older days. Soon after playing it I got really annoyed by it. The music was not like it is with the other ones. There were no ""scary"" things at all. Driving the car doing little things got annoying. Its not worth your money. The game is also extremely short. I beat it in less than a day in Senior detective. I dont know what else to say except to maybe buy any other one except for Secrets can kill."
3,Not Her Interactive's Best,"Oh, I wanted to like this game. I've played them all. I was so excited to find out that Her Interactive was going to be able to make a game based on the first 4 yellow-jackets (original books) in the Nancy Drew series.I loved Nancy's car - until I realized I was going to be subjected to completely pointless errands in order to ""make money"". I hate repetitive, mind-numbing tasks. And this game had it in spades, unfortunately. It was beyond ridiculous.I enjoyed some of the puzzles/challenges - but they weren't worked into the plot terribly well.Finally, it was just too short."
3,A mediocre game,"I was really looking forward to the 12th installment of the Nancy Drew computer game series. However, I was a little disappointed. The game was not as exciting and suspenseful as most of the others. While it was intriguing, it didn't last long. 5 hours of gaming isn't exactly the 20+ hours promised. The puzzles weren't as challenging as I had hoped, even playing senior detective. But, despite its flaws, it is still worth a try. Just split the price with a friend."
4,Great fun for all ages! Perfect for ND First-Timers,"I am an adult and love playing the Nancy Drew games; my teenage daughter likes them; and 86-year old ""gramma"" even played this one. We all enjoyed this one.It didn't take as long to solve it and it was a bit easier than the others, so it is a perfect choice for someone who hasn't played ND games yet.For those of us who are avid ND gamers, it's an interesting change. You actually have to drive her car; but the video switches to an aerial view and it works like manipulating a simple video game until you park the car. Then it switches back to normal mode. This really takes some skill to stay out of the mud puddles and potholes.I wouldn't say that this one was my favorite of all the ND games; but it was FUN."
3,Secret of the Old Clock Video Game,"The video arrived on time and in excellent condition. Unfortunately, it was not acceptable to our granddaughter because of the paranormal power aspect and the crude lady."
2,Dissappointing,"Of all of the Nancy Drew games, I Have to say this was one of the worst. I was expecting better since they have made so many games, but this one was horrible. I didn't really enjoy playing it like I did the others. If you are going to play a Nancy Drew game, don't chose this one!"
2,too easy,"I whizzed through this game. Usually I need to ask for help, but not once with this game. Good for beginners,"
5,My Grand Daughter,"I gave this game to my 14 year old granddaughter because she has all the other games and all the N.Drew books, old and new. I am afraid that she has become too technologically sophisticated for your games. She finished it in one day! I wish that you had different levels of difficulty for older girls. She loves mysteries and loves to solve them. I still haven't figured it out. I love mysteries too."
1,IT ENDED ALREADY??,"I agree with most of the other reviews regarding the dynamics of this game. The graphics are attractive, expecially in the 1920's setting. However, the games were very easy (even in the Senior Decetive version), and the playing time was disappointingly short. I doubt I invested more than 5 hours on this game...which equates to a waste of money. I always look forward to spending time playing the Nancy Drew games, too bad this game was over in the blink of an eye."
5,Nancy Drew is Back!!!,"Placed in the early 1900s, you, as Nancy Drew, must discover why a young girl is constantly hearing things that are seemingly not there. Go around town in Nancy's car, and deliver mail, go fishing, sort pies, play golf, and solve the mystery surrounding a friend's bed & breakfast."
4,Short lived fun,"This game is incredibly fun, despite the fact it only took me three hours to beat. It is definantly one of the shorter Nancy Drew's.Though it may be short in lenght, it is not short in fun. The '30s flair, adds a nice touch to the mystery. Overall, not one of the best, but not the least."
4,Fun but short,This game was fun but very short. The puzzles were much easier than The Curse of Blackmoor Manor and I completed this game in a couple of days. I did not find this game as challenging as the previous one but I still enjoyed playing it. My favorite challenges were the golf game and the driving parts. It was really neat that you could drive Nancy's roadster around town and during the car chase. I would recommend this game for all ages.
2,Not the best...,"First off i just want to say that i've read ""The Secret of the Old Clock"" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline.I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which i can understand. But I'm 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...i didnt get anything. Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 on it. I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games."
5,Nick toons plug and play,"My kids loved this game. Though it lacks a bit in educational value, it was still a very fun game."
5,Nicktoons Plug 'N Play,My 4-1/2-year old grandson loves this video game. He's so thrilled with Nickelodeon on TV and computer with all his favorite characters that this plug 'n play game is definitely an added bonus for him and is a great motor skills and learning tool.
2,Not That Great,The game is slow. When you fold you have to wait for the hand to finish and it can take some time. Also it is hard to see in bright light. It is not made of good quality. Otherwise fine.
5,Excellent for day travelers,"Great for carrying mini-laptop, cameras, water...(I know they don't mix well together...) comfortable and roomy."
3,"Fun, relaxing read","I completely and utterly enjoyed this Christie book. It was good in every way.There weren't a huge number of characters to keep track of like the other Christie books I have read. The characters were an interesting bunch as well, even though they did fall into the categories of A) Rich and snobby or B) Poor and meddling.This has been the first Christie book in which I didn't either already know or correctly guess the ending. So I was very pleased by this. I was glad that the man who helps Poirot solve the mystery wasn't annoying, but kind of likeable.Something I thought interesting is that Poirot seemed calm during the investigation. Usually, in the books I have read, Poirot seems a little anxious but not in this one. Maybe it was the beach setting?But yes, go ahead and read this one. Very fun and enjoyable."
2,HARDLY WORTH READING,"This is a book that I find is a waste of time and money if you are to buy it. A very simple plot, not very well-thought out, as if our beloved Agatha had a deadline she was pushing for. You should be able to guess the murderer quite easily if you have read anything of Christie's before. So, if you want a good mystery, go for a) ABC Murders b) And Then There Were None c) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd d) The Man in the Brown Suit"
1,THIS WAS TERRIBLE!!!,"I certainly agree with the last person commenting. This was no winner. The plot dragged, the story was far from suspenseful, and you felt a heavy obligation to read to the end. I think that Christie has several novels where the deadline was shortly approaching, or she had just run out of ideas. That's certainly acceptable, but don't bother with a less-than mediocre book!"
3,Evil on the island,"Evil Under The Sun was the first Agatha Christie book that I have read. I am not sure that I will read another one of her books or not. The book did have a good plot, but it was rather slow moving. It took approximately sixty pages for someone to die,which to me was a long time. Before, Arlena Stewart Marshall was murdered, the book was a little confusing to me. The book did, however become a little more interesting after the murder. The best part about the book was the way the Hercule Poirot explained the murder. He explained the exact movements of everyone who was involved with the murder. Altogether I thought that it was a fairly good book despite some of it`s faults."
5,By far the Best Mystery Book!!,"I couldn't stop reading this book!!! It was amazingly written. I love how the author introduced the story. Hercules Poirot was fantastic.The book itself was delivered in great condition, shipped in time. You should read this book, you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Surprisingly simple, but well constructed","Once again, Agatha Christie has written a tale that challenges the reader to solve a murder mystery.This time, the place is a hotel on an isolated island, and the victim a beautiful ex-actress that is a part of a relationship triangle.Christie has written a bunch of interesting characters, and manages to convey the atmosphere of the era (1940) and the sunny island and even if the plot is very simple by Christie standards, she has done a good job in constructing the story and writing the character of Hercule Poirot, the most interesting detective in the history of criminal literature.""Evil Under the Sun"" is an entertaining and fun piece of mystery I recommend as a holiday reading."
5,Poirot uncovers more than shells on the beach,"Hercule Poirot, Belgian mystery solver extroindinare, seems to be a magnet for non-violent murders. At a fun seaside resort, Poirot is in the midst of relaxing among the gossiping guests (what else have they got to do?), with the main subject being stunning ex actor Arlena Marshall, who beguiles men and sucks them dry. Cruel and gorgeous, she may be useless, but that doesn't mean she had to die. So Poirot begins investigating the death of the strangled woman (she really was drop-dead gorgeous). And thus begins my first ever Christie novel, and I enjoyed it through and through. Christie gives dozen of red herrings and has you guessing who-dun-it constantly, each time differently, and by the time it was over, I was still wrong. Really, really enjoyable."
5,I liked it,I liked this book. I have seen the movie as well. I still found the book to be interesting even though I have seen the movie already.
1,Rip Off,"The dealer was dishonest, the format was made for British DVD's, but to tell the buyer that would have meant missing a sale. The product was worthless and as far as I'm concerned so were the buck-toothed dealers. The whole process was a rip off and a waste of money. Never again. I really can't rate a product I wasn't able to use. I love the movie but that's it"
2,Dangerous,"The locking mechanism broke after a few days and the knife wouldn't shut completely after. I returned it for a refund. Although the brand is Smith and Wesson it's a cheaply ""Made in China"" product."
4,Well made and useful,"This is a nice looking and well-made knife, It sharpens well and holds an edge well. I like the brush chrome finish, The knife is a little larger than I like to carry in my pocket so I did not give it 5 stars"
2,Bit of a let down,"I discovered this series in 1993, I devoured the first five books and absolutely loved every page of them. It was exciting, original, fun, and interesting. Then I read Days of Bitter Strength and abosolutely hated it. I felt the author completely lost his way and I really did not enjoy where he took this once-promising series. It was one of the biggest literary letdowns I have ever been dealt."
3,Good... but not great,"I liked the way this book was done. Once again the Chung Kuo series manages to capture my attention. However, i feel that David Wingrove lost something in writting this, and the end of the last book. Some aspect of realism or such was lost."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this book or its sequels. David Wingrove started out great with this series, but he got lost somewhere. By the end of this opus the author blatantly uses a ""deus ex machina"" . I felt betrayed because of all the time I spent reading the last 3 books."
2,A failing ending to a great series,"Don't bother reading this book. Just end Chung Kuo with book 6 and be done with it. This book was done so poorly that I can't believe that Wingrove actually wrote it. It is weak, wishy washy and slow, as opposed to his gutsy, intelligent efforts in the first six Chung Kuo books. Don't bother with it."
2,Promising beginning and middle let down by the ending,"Just like its predecessor, Days of Bitter Strength throws away an interesting first three quarters with the most preposterous, ill thought out and badly executed ending. One gets the feeling that Wingrove was working to a deadline leaving him with thirty minutes to write a hundred pages. Characters behave in a way that is totally alien to the way that they had been presented thus far (Li Yuan, in particular, whose fall into dotage is ridiculous)And anyway, has anybody counted the number of times characters 'shudder' in Wingrove's series? The whole thing seems to be written by someone with real talent who simply cannot be bothered to write more than one draft. Which is a real shame, because if ever a series had real potential it is this one (and I thought the first three were really good...)"
2,A hollow shell,"Having read Chung Kwo series, I feel as if each books' ratings are somewhat bound to the healthiness of the T'ang's dominion it in turn describes. We know it is science fiction, but to many rabbits are popped out of the hats of its magicians (De Vore, Machine etc). And particularly in Book Seven, too many matters are over-simplified, with a story-line to far off-track. The only thing I appreciated about ""The Days of Bitter Strength"" is that it's truly the first real page turner of all seven books."
2,snug and sturdy but zipper broke,"I bought this case a week ago for Canon SD 1100IS and took it on a family vacation with kids. I dropped the case with camera in it and it did protect the camera well. However, a 2 days after this incident the zipper broke. A sturdier zipper is warranted to make this a perfect case."
1,Too little,"Nice case but the size wasn""t even close. Listed as 4.5 X 6.5 x 2. Would not take my 2.5 x 3.75 x 1.25 Lumix LZ8 . Gave it away."
3,Great little case,It is a great case. I was pleased with it. Right up until it was stolen with the camera still in it. Only had them 1 week. But it was a great camera case.
2,Boring Ethics,"I needed this book for school, so I had no choice. I would not have read it in my own free will. It's very dryly, if that's a word, written. I know there are some better ethics books out there."
2,WAS THERE REALLY NOTHING ELSE TO GIVE THE EDGAR TO?,"Ross Thomas isn't exactly one of my favourite authors, but I liked some of his other books, so I didn't miss the occasion to read his Edgar-winning novel (his second, because he had won twenty years ago for ""The Cold War Swap"") and I have been very disappointed. It's as well written than usual, with brilliant metaphors and dialogue, but the plot seemed to me some confused. The characters speak almost only by epigraphs, and one never know what the story is about. I don't have in mind the other Edgar nominees for this year, but I'm sure there was many novels more deserving than this."
5,Unknown Treasure,"A fellow book lover tipped me off to the great books authored by Mr. Ross Thomas last summer. Since then, I have read nine of his books and Briarpatch is one of the best. Read this book. Read his McCorkle & Padillo series. Read his Wu and Durant series. None will disappoint. How this author has remained off my radar screen is a mystery to me."
2,Original Publication Date?,"It seems to me that the fact that this book was originally published in 1984 should be included in the book's description. Some people will opt for newer material, some may think the price is too high for a book that has been out for 20+ years. The book itself is only okay."
4,Deep into networking,"It would be easy to think of a whole variety of things as networking, web clients, email, ftp. This book works at a lower level than that, debugging routers, internet connectivity, file sharing, and the basics. Though the basics can be difficult. If I could fault the book it would be that the exposition for some of the recipes are a little too short. Simply introducing a solution as opposed to walking through it at a reasonable depth. That being said, sometimes sign posts are as valuable as step-by-step maps."
4,Good information,"Q and A format in areas like network adapter problems, mixing communication speeds, configuring routers, mapped drives, messenger features getting blocked by firewalls, that sort of thing."
5,here i am,"in my bed at 11 AM!!!! at sencod floor of my house the router is at the first!!! my laptop have a great signal and a good quality, i am using my msn, my outlook and the explorer, for some people this card means troubles acording to the reviews for means freedom!!!!"
2,Not easy to set up - also not easy to find out why it doesn't work.,"Well, I can at least say the shipper was prompt in delivering this to me. that's about as far as getting it to work goes, though.I've been trying to find a way to get it to work with an IBM thinkpad I have that runs Win 2000 Pro. I would think that given the operating system, quality of the thinkpad, and the fact that the router it is supposed to talk to is also a linksys that there would be minimal issues. Unfortunately, all I have is a useless chuck of hardware that powers on, appears to work in the properties, but make no connection whatsoever. I would not waste money on this model again - If you're looking for a network adapter, try looking for something a little more current, or that has a proven track record for working with similar systems to the one you have."
4,Great for older laptops,"This is great for older laptops because lot of them use the older 1.0 USB ports and it struggles to send and receive signals. I prefer this plug and use then USB connection due to it's always better and more reliable, (my own personal opinion). I recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have and older laptop."
2,Linksys,While the product I received turned out to be faulty the seller was very helpful and they were quick to refund my purchase price. I will be doing business with them in the future.
1,Doesn't Work With Texas Instruments CardBus Controllers,After two weeks of dealing with Linksys Tech Support I was finally told there are no drivers for the WPC54GS and Texas Instruments CardBus Controllers. If you're not sure what controller you have open Device Manager and expand your PCMCIA Adapter.
2,Didn't Work,"Bought the card to match the Linksys Speedbooster Router, but the card didn't work well enough...My old Orinoco card (802.11b) worked seamlessly with the router also the inbuilt Intel-Pro wireless card (802.11g) worked with the router without a glitch. I tried upgrading the firmware etc as specified by Linksys but it didn't help. Finally I am returning the card."
5,Linksys WPC54GS Wireless-G Notebook Adapter,"I purchased this item to give my ageing IBM Thinkpad wi-fi capability. My software-engineer son had no difficulty in installing it on Windows 98 (Second Edition). I have limited experience with using it to date, but it has functioned well at my local library. It is not clear whether all features (such as SpeedBooster) will work with Windows 98, but the basic connectivity appears OK."
2,Complications,"For some reason, it froze, then will connect to the wireless, but will not go to internet; it did in the beginning. Go figure. Trouble shooting suggests an address conflict with another device on the network. Pain. Don't have the energy to call Linksys and get help."
5,Linksys WPC54GS-Wireless G Notebook Adapter,"If your laptop has a pcmcia slot, but no wireless integrated internet card. This adapter will provide you with wireless internet access. set-up is easy,cost is low, and internet access is good.Linksys support site provides drivers for all versions of this card if needed."
1,ROUTER CARD,"THE ROUTER CARD DOES NOT WORK, MY OLD ONE WORKS WITH THE NEW ROUTER BUT THE NEW CARD DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, SO I NEED A REFUND FOR IT, OR A REPLACEMENT, THANKS"
1,Did not connect to the Internet,"I got this card for a Sony vaio notebook adapter and our corporate network that uses WEP encryption. I do know if this is a problem with the other Linksys network cards, but while this one would connect to the Access point, it would not connect to the network. I contacted Linksys support which was extremely clueless and the person kept asking another tech for help. I returned the card, and got a dlink card. The dlink wireless network card worked fine."
4,great product from Linksys,I use this WPC54GS with my Thinkpad T30. Setup was easy with the software they give you. I also bought the WRT54GS router. I have a cable modem so its very fast. I can be online at the kitchen table (with my thinkpad) while the kids are online in the study. Had an issue with setting up when my laptop did not get connected to internet. Just redid the settings and bingo it worked. Pay attention and write down settings while you do the initial router setup. Your adaptor settings must be the same.
1,A piece of junk,"Do not buy this product. You can read the review and know that most of the time this doesn't work. Linksys doesn't provide support. If you want to return, the seller charges restocking fees and shipping charges. I called and the cust rep can't tell how much refund I will get back. I am not spending postage without knowing how much I will get back! I posted review before and it mysteriously disappeared. I filed a complaint to Amazon regarding the integrity of the systen and now I am posting my review AGAIN."
2,"Not a lot to choose from, this will have to do!","This is the second one, the first one I got really didn't work. There is not a lot to choose from out there so this is as good as I could find. Does not work as well with the matching modem as i would have thought. The booster is just a gimmick, it didn't really boost anything."
5,Installed Quickly,"After installing my new modem and router, I inserted this card into my laptop. It installed much quicker than expected, which was a pleasant surprise, and it works great. I've never had wireless access before, so I was surprised to see that it picked up several wireless networks around my neighborhood!"
5,Awesome!,"I don't know why I waited so long to get a wireless card for my notebook. This item works great. I have had no problems. My signal is strong out on the patio, and even upstairs. Makes my old IBM Thinkpad like new!!!! Love it!"
1,Really hard to believe,"If you want to insure that your child will grow up to be a guilt ridden, judgemental and emotionally distrubed by all means by them this sick book."
1,cheap video knock off,"pretty messy collage of performances from the three mentioned artists.phil manzanera is good,keith richards isn't too bad but jack bruce and bob dylan ( yes he's on here too but why bother? )are ordinary.it doesn't help that this a cheap video tape knock off and clocks in at less than 50 mins with the only redeeming feature being the reasonable audio but with the level of performancxe in parts, who cares?. save your coin fans, this is not for you! fyi this review is by andrew,not louise (my wife)"
4,THESE WERE NUMBER ONE AFTER ALL,"It is senseless to lament that this collection lacks some good songs (they are available elsewhere). This is, after all, a collection of number one hits. Perhaps the other good songs never reached number one, so they would not exactly fit on this collection. Whatever the case, this is still a splendid offering, with tastes of different Elvis styles... standards which everyone can recognize. Elvis is the king, is he not?"
3,"Works well, but uncomfortable","I have no complaints about the heart-rate-monitoring - it does just what it says it will.But I think the wrist part of it is very difficult to put on and take off, and is uncomfortable. I thought for sure I'd find the chest-strap uncomfortable - but no problem there!The watch part is solid hard plastic, so you can't change the band. I've never had a watch that I had such trouble putting on! Maybe it just isn't flexible enough."
4,What else can be said except....,"I've listened to this CD countless times, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a near-perfect balance of beauty and darkness."
2,Feeder seed holes way too large,"This bird feeder is great looking. But the seed holes are WAY TOO LARGE and allows the seeds to pour out of the filled feeder. Also the tray is very small for the amount of seeds spilled into it causing seeds to spill out of the tray. We bought a 13"" seed catcher that helps eliminate that problem. But the feeder is not even practical for sunflower seeds as the feeder holes are even too large for those type of seeds. We are going to modify the feeder by placing a thin piece of aluminum sheeting inside the feeder, covering the holes and cut new smaller seed holes in the aluminum. Hope this works. Too bad the design flaw has cause more expense and more work. I would not reccomend this product for any type of birdseed."
2,Better if you buy the pieces separatelly,Do not buy it!!! Those pieces are sold separatelly and it is cheaper!!! dont be fool and buy it at the elevated price!!!
4,Hungry for You,"Kristina Fulton (sometimes billed as Christina Fulton) is one sexy vampire.The plot's a bit strange; an old hotel resurects Kristina as a vampire after she committed suicide, then asks her to go & kill the person holding the deeds to the hotel (does the hotel want the deed so it own's itself? Hotel Liberation! Free the Hotels!)But, visually, it's very interesting. And, did I say, Kristina's a sex godess? I've been waiting for this to come onto DVD for ages."
3,Eyes is a vampire movie with South Beach flair,"The Girl With the Hungry Eyes is based upon a short story by Frietz (sp?) Leiber and it's about a woman in the 1930s (owner of the fashionable South Beach hotel, The Tides) who kills herself because the man she wanted was cheating on her. Flash foward 60 years and the hotel is about to be demolished. The evil place brings Louise (Jon Jacobs' alum Christina Fulton) back to life as a vampire. With every person she kills, the hotel restores itself. Will Louise save her soul?I came to see this movie after viewing director Jon Jacobs' newer film ""Lucinda's Spell"". Jacobs must have a love affair with Ms. Fulton because he uses her alot, but the combination works. Also try to spot the director in a small but memorable role of Henry! He's not that bad an actor."
5,I LOVE UHF,"THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY I COULDENT BREATH!!! THERE IS ONE PART CALLED RAULS WILD KINGDOM AND GUESS WHAT HE THREW A POODLE OUT THE WINDOW, TALK ABOUT COMEDY I'LL GIVE IT 5 STARS. BUY THIS MOVIE ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A Cult Movie That's Surprisingly Funny!,"When I first watched this movie, I laughed [alot], thinking it was just some unknown 80's film. Well, it was, but this movie has achieved an appropriate cult following since it's original failure. Parts of this movie are laugh-out-loud hilarious (Raul's Wild Animal Kingdom) and some of the characters are just funny in themselves (Michael Richard's character). Plenty of clips of fake commercials and shows as well as parodies of popular movies make up the funniest parts of this film. Some of the humor is ridiculously stupid and screwball, but all comedy fans will really enjoy this movie. It's also interesting to see how some of these stars were like before they got really big. Weird Al fan or not, rent it and you'll enjoy it.Score: 8/10"
3,"UHF great for Weird Al fans, not for general public","I am a serious fan of Weird Al. I've been to concerts,fairs,and met Al himself. But to be honest, the general public might be turned off by the film. The loud characters,oddball lines,and the storyline might be too weird to take. For example, the main character George Newman (Weird Al)lives in a karate studio owned by a loud oriental teacher who screams""STUPID"" almost every one of his lines.Or Stanley Spadowski(Michael Richards)who drives his fellow men crazy from his wild idotic expressions and words.Yet if you liked most Monty Python films this would be worth seeing.But remember just like Al said himself in his Behind the Music,""It's not supposed to be serious, it's just a movie to be goofy."""
5,Made when Weird Al was funny!,"Ok. This is not the best movie ever. It doesn't have a well-written story or characters who make you feel their pain in moments of deepest sorrow. But what it is is THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE! I'm not going to go through every single joke like some reviewers might, but I will say this...Conan the Librarian made me laugh so hard, I cried and lost control of my face not just the first time I saw it, but also the second time as well! That just doesn't happen, folks. I'm a very depressed man who hates life. And it happened TWICE!!!!"
3,weird al,"if you liked weird als music,youll like this movie.its very silly but loads of fun.the kids will like it.if you are worried about how cool you are all the time and cant relax then dont watch this because its a movie for people who likewhat they want.individuals and dreamers.the bad guy is this old man from a tv station who is als rival when he has to run a tv station.this movie is very very funny.the bad guy is a real pain in the ass.its definately worth watching!"
4,Definitely for 'Weird Al' fans only...not that I'm a big fan,"Yes, this movie is probably one of the worse movies ever made. So what? Why are so many of the 1 star reviewers so bitter about it? This movie, IMO, is very funny (albeit, stupidly funny).If you don't like ""Weird Al"" type humor, you'll probably hate this movie. If you do like that type of humor, you'll probably love it, though you'll totally understand why so many people think it sucks.The characters are kind of lame, with the exception of Raul Hernandez (lol). There really isn't much more to say about it. If I were a critic, I would give this movie the lowest possible rating. But since I'm not a critic and I enjoy watching this every so often with my kids, I'm giving it 4 stars (giving it 5 stars would be unfair to my other 5 star reviews)."
5,"Honest, Clever, Genius Humor for the whole family!","This movie is a sleeper... it is easily in my Top Ten funniest movies! The only copy I own is a BETA HiFi commercial release! That shows you how long I have enjoyed this movie! This movie is one of the primary reasons I still have all my Beta equipment!However, my Beta copy is wearing out from all the viewings!This is not only a ""cult-classic"", this is also a stone-cold bonafide comedy milestone! The humor in this movie is so clever and well-timed you almost have to see it at least 3 or 4 times to catch most of it!Highly recommended! It doesn't have to resort to overt sex, gratuitous violence or fowl language and can be enjoyed by everyone in the family. The older you get, the more the jokes make sense!I can't say enough about this one!"
5,This movie rocks!,"Oh my, I've probably watched this movie 100's of times, and it's still awesome! If you have a VCR and a pulse, than it's neccesary that you buy this!"
5,who would like it,"A good movie for people who1. Like ""Wierd Al""2. Have seen a lot of movies and enjoy paradoies.3. Want a clean family comedy4. People of all agesFor those people who have seen the movie...I thought the funniest part is when the boy get's to ""drink from the fire hose..."" I was in tears laughing so hard."
4,"""Complainers? We don't need no stinkin' complainers!""","How can you resist a movie where they throw poodles out of windows, let kids drink from fire hoses, where Conan hacks people apart because some people turned a book in late? The movie does have its slow parts, but the spoofs and skits are absolutely hilarious. I won't tell you all of them because then you won't go and rent or buy this great movie. This movie is really good if you are a Weird Al fan, like REALLY off-the-wall humor, parodies, something that can make you laugh. Some people hate this movie, but I think it's because they're trying to see it as a movie. UHF is not really trying to be a movie, it's trying to be more of a collage of parodies. Anyway, see it for yourself. There's no telling how many stomach muscles you'll burst watching this hilarious film."
5,I laughed to the point of tears,"I caught a few Weird Al videos in the 80's...I was never a huge fan. But when I saw this, there were moments I was driven to the silliest laughing fits. I still laugh just from remembering the horribly inappropriate moment when the little kid spat in Uncle Nutsy's face. This is definitely a guilty pleasure kind of comedy.The only movie that had me laughing this hard since UHF was Something About Mary. I got the DVD because my VHS copy is worn out.Weird Al manages to make even the usually interminable DVD menu screens into a funny little joke on the DVD, though he provides needlessly derogatory and self-deprecating narratives of the deleted scenes section.Thanks, Weird Al, for making us laugh."
5,27 times? Amateur.,"I must buy this dvd not only because it's the best movie, but because I watched the vhs so much, I wore it down. Yeah!!! hALifax needs AL !!!!!!!"
5,HYSTERICAL!!!,"This is positively THE most hysterical movie I have ever seen. Sure, it's alot funnier the first time, but I can't wait for the special features. BUY THIS DVD!!!"
5,Great movie if you got lottsa ham in you.,"When it comes to movies I gotta admit I'm a sucker for these silly flicks. Weird Al is just as funny in this as he is on his records. There are many classic scenes like the ""teaching poodles to fly"" and ""ghandi 2"" and Richardson's performance as Stanley Spadowski. I can't wait for this to come out on dvd!"
4,A Long Time Ago in A Galaxy in Some Crazy Guy's Head,"This is a funny movie. It is part satire and part homage; and it works. There are some lulls, and some skits don't go over so well; but, on the whole it will entertain you and make you laugh. I saw this film in the theater when it was first released many years ago. It has aged well and is even funnier in spots. Weird Al is his usual dorky, idiosyncratic self playing the dispirited manager of his Uncle's broken down UHF station. The supporting cast is just as good , especially Michael Richards as the brain damaged Stanley the janitor who loves his mop more than life itself and Kevin McCarthy as the scheming villain who will stop at nothing to maintain his dominance as the king of trash television. It's a goofy, quirky, dopey, funny movie, with a happy ending that is actually believable. I wonder why Weird Al never made another."
5,Funny and entertaining,If you are a fan of Weird Al then you will enjoy this movie. It is funny and light. Don't expect a movie that makes you think or get emotional. UHF is just fun and exactly what a person needs on Friday night with popcorn and family around the tube. Great fun.
5,Greatest Zany Comedy of the 20th Century!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This highly under appreciated film goes where no movie has gone before, breaking new ground for silliness and fun. Starring Weird Al (from ...his CD's), Michael Richards (from Seinfeld), Fran Drescher (from The Nanny) and many others. Guranteed laughs! Have seen it many times! Gotta love it! If you don't buy it, ""You so stupid!!!!!!!!!"". Can't wait for the DVD release!!!!!!!!!!! June 4 YES!!!!!!!! Thank you MGM & Weird Al!!!"
4,Michael (Kramer) Richards' lost performance,"This movie is funny. It's late night funny, like something you might catch on UHF. The parodies are good. It loses focus towards the end (around the time you nod off anyway) and Weird Al tries WAY too hard to be funny and carry the film. He can't, but his supporting cast DOES! They bring new meaning to the title ""SUPPORTING"" cast. Underdog veterans like John Paragon, Victoria Jackson, Kevin McCarthy and Gedde Watanabe prop Weird Al up (hey, for a guy known for doing silly song parodies, he pulls his weight. The scene where the kid spits in his face is pretty darned funny) but the REAL treat is watching Michael Richards in a pre-Seinfeld role as Stanley Spadowski. Much like the character in film, once he's on screen, the movie really takes off. I watch this movie over and over just for his scenes. Truly one of the most overlooked performances of that year. Wotta genius."
3,so-so,"Some absolutely fantastic gags and set-pieces, but ultimately gets bogged down in stupidity. Worth a look, but I'd say borrow it from a friend or rent it rather than buy it."
2,Not what I remembered,I remember LOVING this movie and all of its silliness. I recently made it a nostalgia purchase and realized-it isn't that great. but my 6 year old LOVED it and continues to watch it all the time. My child is now a Weird Al Fanatic...and I am ok woth that!
3,A so-so movie,"I am a 13 year old fan of Al. I own 8 of his CDs (at the time I wrote this) and have a cpy of Weird Al Live, Video Library, and UHF. The first time that I saw UHF, I wasn't really paying a lot of attention. Why, because at the time, I didn't care. I bought the movie on VHS and watched it again. I found it quite funny. Sure there is some comedy in it that just isn't funny. For example, in the part were the kid gets to drink from the fire hose, and is blasted. Come on people! That isn't funny. Its just STUPID!UHF has some funny parts in it. The Wheel of Fish scenes are quite funny. The movie has a very undeveloped storyline, but offers many laughs.But after seeing this movie about three times, you won't want to see it again. It gets boring when you know what happens. That was why it was funny in the first place; unexpected comedy.My final word to you is to try to rent this movie instead of buying it."
1,Dreadful,"I'm surprised they're bothering to release this film on DVD. This movie is dreadful, and that's coming from a 'Weird Al' fan. The plot isn't worth describing, because the movie is a collage of sketches, most of them juvenile and stupid. Of course, juvenile is what you expect from 'Weird Al', so that's not really the problem. The problem is that 95% of the jokes don't work. That's not just my opinion, that was the general public consensus, as the film bombed and Weird Al's career took some time to recover. There are some attempts to be satirical, but most of them are too broad to have any bite. If your idea of funny is someone getting hacked apart by Conan for turning in a library book late, perhaps this film will appeal, but for me, there was exactly one amusing gag: Spatula City -- a giant warehouse emporium full of spatulas of all sizes and varieties. I still can't get that one out of my head."
4,Weird Al is cool,"For good clean fun, Weird Al is the best. I don't care that the critics panned this movie when it came out, or that it was a box office dud. I can watch this movie over and over again and get a kick out of it each time. The line: ""Badgers? We don't need no stinking badgers."" from UHF has become a somewhat well known phrase."
5,Laugh till you cry!,"For everyone who knows and loves Weird Al, this is the best movie ever. A friend talked me into watching it almost 10 years ago, and since then it has been the favorite of many family members and many friends. It should definitely be re-released!"
5,I'm thinking of something blue...,"I absolutely loved UHF! My friend has it on tape and whenever I go over there, we watch it and crack up! I love every part of it. I wish they would re-release it because I want to buy it! I love it when Stanley is eating the watermelon and then he stops and says ""Tastes like poo."""
4,he's in my heart,"I am a major ""Weird Al"" fan...met him, love him! Watch this movie with the commentary running - you'll love it! Did you know UHF was filmed in Tulsa, OK?"
5,What are you nuts!,"If you thought this movie wasn't funny you got to be NUTS! This movie was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is a laugh a minute, I take that back it's a laugh a second. Also watch for Raul's animal kingdom(were puddles jump out of 3rd story windows)who is that guy anyways. I've got to admidt some of the scenes were just stupid but the halarious parts make up for that. Speeking of nuts ""Weird Al"" is absolutly nuts. This guy has made so many cd's performed at so many concerts and he still has it . The guy is a comical genuis. I recomend this movie anyone with an ounce of since of humour. The movie also has some good extra content. The funniest is the deleted scenes. It is funnie but,I don't want to give it away. Take my advice watch this movie. miss out on it forget about it"
5,EXCELLENT!,"I loved the movie UHF when I first saw it, so naturally I was excited when I saw it available on DVD. I watched it and I was very impressed. Excellent special features (deleted scenes with Al's comedic commentary, Audio commentary featuring Al, the director, Michael Richards, Emo Phillips and Victoria Jackson).This is an excellent movie, and an excellent DVD. This should be in your collection!Jeremy"
5,Best movie ever!!!,"What can I say ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is the Greatest, once you get hocked you can't go back. The movie is great, if only we really had a UHF Channel 62 on cabble then we would have quality tv for a change. Town Talk, Wheel of Fish, Rauel's Wild Kingdom, Staying fit with Skike and Mike, Stanley Spudoski's Clubhouse, and all the other shows like Conan the librarian and Ghandi 2 are great. Must watch many times, never gets old!!!!!"
5,Best Movie in the WORLD,"Okay let's get started, Weird Al Music is the best thing to listen to anyytime, anyplace. 3 years ago, I rented this movie because he was in it. From the train in the beginning to Stanley Spedousky, It is one of the best movies in the world. Anyone who doesn't like it is STUPID. (That is a movie quote)"
5,LOVE,"One of the great cinema classics. If you watch this and don't say ""Wow! This is the greatest movie EVER!"" There is something wrong with you."
2,scratched,"it was scratched and will only play on one side. skips and is not (new or like new) as described. but i love this movie and i was determined to watch it. so , ill deal."
3,"Stupid humor, but it gets a chuckle...","This is a stupid humor, no thought involved comedy. If you are expexting anything else, you will be dissapointed. If you are in the mood for that though, sit back and crack a smile and laugh like you were 12 again."
1,If your are dumb enough to watch it.......,... I'm sure you are dumb enough to enjoy it. Who watchs this talentless twit? Here's a guy who's career highlight was 'Eat It'. Christ.
1,No Talent = No Sales,"Wierd Al, huh? Weird is correct, but talented you say? I think not. He is a professional plagiarist. He makes his living from walking in the shadows of other talented artists. And UHF is ranked five stars? What a complete slash on American citizens. Apparently, we have nothing better to do. Michael Richard of Seinfeld fame, was lucky that this movie did not ruin his career. I give it 1 star and that is only because I could not give it a zero."
5,Hilarious Movie,"This movie provides non-stop laughs and if anyone has to wonder why then they have never listened to or seen ""Weird"" Al. This man is the king at making parody songs. I enjoy most of his songs."
5,Awesome!,"A better ratio of belly laughs to groans than any Hollywood comedy I've seen in the last decade, with the exception, perhaps, of ""Galaxy Quest"". A ""Must Have"" movie!"
5,More than you expect,"Any Al fan will love this DVD. This isn't a Hollywood blockbusting epic, its a silly story full of spoofs. No spine tingling effects or huge room filling sound, that isn't the point. The DVD provides the best available quality for this picture and is true to the original. The special features are terrific. Jay Levey and Al's commentary are a blast. This is a must own for any Weird Al fan."
4,A tour of Tulsa...with Al as your guide,"Maybe I'm biased, but this DVD contains one of the best commentary tracks ever recorded. UHF was filmed in my hometown in the summer of '88, and Al gives exact addresses of each location! (The Burger World set is down the street from my house.) While viewers on the east and west coasts may not care about this, I was deeply moved. The only time Oklahoma receives any sort of national recognition is when there is a local tragedy. The UHF DVD is anything but tragic. The transfer is superb, the features are numerous, and the price is VERY attractive. Are you listening, Paramount?"
4,"GREAT MOVIE, Poor Transfer","How red is red? The movie's terrific and long awaited. No, it's not Shakespeare, but where did it EVER pretend to be anything other than a fun romp. I'd give it 5 stars except for the transfer, which is not a reflection on Weird Al, but rather on MGM. But, hey...I'll take it! GREAT EXTRAS!"
5,Bring it Back.... PLEASE,This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm a huge fan of all of Wierd Al's music and his movie is just as hilarious. I really need a copy and everyone should see it once. It's great.
5,I LIKE IT,I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF WEIRD ALS. WELL THIS IS HIS BETTER ACHIEVEMENT. I THINK HE SHOULD DO ANOTHER MOVIE.
5,Funniest Film Ever,"I Can't Watch This Movie Without Crying From Laughter.The Uncle Nutsys Clubhouse Show Is Halarious.My Least Favorite Part Of This Movie Is The Beverly Hilbillies Music Video,But Every Thing Else Is So Funny,It Totally Makes Up For It."
5,A Sad time to see it leave,many people are looking for this where did it go! everyone who reads this rate this movie high so we can at least get it back in print for a while.
4,An intriguing look at first-time parenthood,"Richard Mullins offers a touching, frequently off-beat look at getting to know his baby daughter, Anna. During twelve weeks as a stay-at-home dad, Mullins -- a business journalist -- shed the world of IPOs and corporate scandals for laundry and creative play. Along the way, he trained his gift for noticing the little things and describes with wit and warmth how he came to understand Anna's charming, sometimes explosive moods. At Home With Anna discusses the panicky feeling of new responsibility, the un-asked-for comraderie found during public-bathroom diaper changing, and the zany world of infant's toys. Great for new or soon-to-be parents . . . or for more established parents looking to connect with the magical first year of parenthood."
3,It's not about you Natalie,"Lee Goldberg just didn't get it quite right in this one. Sure it's got Monk's usual crime-solving skills and strange mannerisms. And a few funny points. Also introduces Monk's first use of the drug that lets him get on a plane without rushing to get right off again. But the story is too much a combination of Rockford Files and Hawaii Five-O take-off, and Natalie Teeger's interrupted vacation. It's not about you Natalie -- it's supposed to be about Monk."
3,"A Light, Pleasurable Read","Adrian Monk is out of his element. Unable to accept his assistant, Natalie's departure for a vacation in Hawaii, he follows her to Kauai. Natalie is horrified for good reason. Traveling with the obsessive compulsive Monk is a nightmare, and her hope for a peaceful vacation evaporates completely when a woman is murdered at their hotel. Inevitably, Monk is on the case with the unwanted help of a famous TV psychic.Fans of the TV show will know what to expect from a Monk novel: an amazing character with plenty of funny moments in the plot. I really enjoyed Lee Goldberg's balance of description, humor, and action. As a mystery, though, the story lacks suspense and because the suspect list is so short, I figured out who the killer is before Monk does, and I'm easily fooled. Still, it was a light, pleasurable read which Monk fans will truly enjoy."
4,hooray for Mr Monk,"Mr Monk gets on a plane, thanks to some drugs (which no one is criticizing him for taking) which inhibit his fears. He's a loose cannon until they wear off. Why he is on a plane; his companion went to a wedding and left him alone. The murder that runs the entire book is well thought out and most like those we like to see Monk solve. Again, many of his quirks are not found in this tome but the overall read is very good."
5,Monk Fan,"I am very happy with the large print book offerings and especially of the ""Monk"" series. Amazon has the best selection. Thanks"
4,"Entertaining, but he drinks milk again... ;-)","I enjoyed this, a nice book for the beach, although the plot moves along rather slowly. What I don't get is that Monk is having cereals with milk AGAIN - an error which already occured in the first book (another error there: Monk can only solve the murder because he is allergic to cats, which he isn't in the TV series). This shouldn't happen! Just nit-picking here, I know ;-)"
4,"Thanks, Mr. Goldberg!","The other reviews have done a nice job of describing Mr. Monk Goes to Hawaii, so I just want to comment on something I found especially refreshing in the novel.Mr. Monk's explanations to Natalie of how the psychic performs his tricks are right on the money. But, especially since the novel is based on a TV show, I kept expecting the little twist at the end. You know, the moment where we find out the psychic really did know something he couldn't have known - the little ""oooo"" moment almost every TV show with an alleged psychic puts in to show us that the skeptics were wrong (or as an attempt at humor). But, it never happened. Thanks, Mr. Goldberg!"
4,Enjoyable and easy read,"Natalie needs a break from Monk and actually thinks that she will be able to have a relaxing vacation when she goes to Hawaii for a friend's wedding. But Monk doesn't want to be left alone or have a substitute caretaker, so he shows up on Natalie's plane all drugged up so he can survive the trip. Once in Hawaii, Monk gets himself and Natalie involved in an elderly lady's accident that he knows is murder, and there goes Natalie's vacation. Monk and Natalie assist the Hawaiian police with the case as well as some others in between. Monk also goes up against a psychic during his investigation of the possible murder, and if you know Monk, you know this psychic is definitely not one of his favorite people. It's all set in beautiful Hawaii. Natalie does get away a little to site see, and sometimes drags Monk with her. All his quirks are there, as well as some new phobias Monk didn't even know he had. The story keeps you guessing about who the murderer is until the end. I recommend."
1,I think I just threw up a little bit in my mouth,"Um, yeah this was a brilliant piece of intellectual literature. I mean, just check out the title, ""Mr. Monk Goes to Hawaii""? MOVE OVER SHAKESPEARE, THERE'S A NEW BARD IN TOWN.Thank god there's someone around writing fiction based on someone else's characters, we all know that's never been done before. Oh right... it has been done before. I must have been confused by the fact that other people actually do it well, and aren't just whoring themselves out for the money. Carry on!"
4,Enjoyable Monk Adventure,"I don't need to rehash the plot as so many other reviewers described it. I felt this was a fun offering in the series, although I did feel like I was in a Hawaiian travelogue sometimes! I also guessed some things right off the bat, which is unusual for me; I knew about the one character who was lying and also realized how another character was accomplishing what he was doing immmediately. Fun just for Monk's reaction to Hawaii (and thankfully brief but humorous appearances by ""The Monk"")."
4,A forgotten classic from the 70's,"I really liked this album. It was a hit in 1976 when it was released, hitting number 11 on the Billboard album charts and being certified GOLD by the RIAA. It includes the top 20 hit Today's The Day and the minor hit Amber Cascades. Other songs received some airplay like Jet Boy Blue (this song should have been released as a single), Letter, and Watership Down. Legendary Beatles producer, George Martin produced this album and makes heavy use of strings and horns, but it is done very well. A very good album."
5,Great Book,"I love this book and the price was amazing,it's a great buy for all you ABC Soap Fans. Great condition for being used."
5,Rivals LCD and Plasma - Samsung makes the best DLP,"I did my research on DLP vs. LCD vs. Plasma. When I first saw this model in the showroom, I thought it was an LCD because of the brightness. The 10000:1 contrast ratio is one of the most important and top benefits of this particular model. The 1080p resolution is just icing on the cake (although I have yet to see the benefit of this as very few devices can output at 1080p). Anyway, I am waiting to get DirectTV setup so that I can get HD. Right now I am pulling in some HD channels on just on old powered antenna I bought years ago. I can not wait to see HD on this bad boy. Don't delay, this is a great set and the price is fantastic. Samsung just released the next version of this model (HL-S5688W 56 inch), so my guess is that this set will continue to be discounted as they dwindle down the inventory."
2,BE CAUTIOUS!!,"WATCH OUT!!!!....I bought this tv new. I had it two years and the thing just quit one day. I took it to a repairman and they told me the motherboard was out. It was not under warranty anymore and I would be better off to buy a new one. They could not get the tv to turn on. I took it home and took it apart myself to see if I could fix it. When I put it back together, I could get it to come on and act right for about 15 minutes or so. After that, it just freezes up and won't do anything. Be careful if you buy this tv! I won't buy another samsung."
2,Will not recommend this tv to anyone,"I had this tv for about 2 years this Dec 10 and I had to replace the light bulb 3 times with samsung and 2 times from a website online, I dont watch tv that much and the light bulb last long I think if your interested in buying this tv you have a back up tv while you order a new light bulb. the bulbs are not cheap to over 100 dollars everytime."
5,Amazing! Better than SONY!,"I think the guy writing the review below was right on, except this is better than the SONY. I too need to literally tear myself away from this thing! It's just beautiful to watch. This Samsung has actually surpassed my high expectations and I give it 5 stars. I am a careful shopper and spend alot of time and energy getting the best bang for my hard earned dollar (ask my Wife ;>). I could buy which ever HDTV product I wanted and I compared this to Plasma, LCD, and even the Sony XBR. I think the later is the only one that compared to this set (I got to see them side-by-side), but given the price difference and size this was perfect. I also believe this set has a nicer exterior which should be considered (it is a nice glossy piano black), but I guess that is just a matter of taste. Look out SONY, Samsung is for real!"
5,Outstanding HDTV at an impressive price,"Finally stepped up to HDTV. Shopped around and got this TV which appears to be the most TV for the money. Amazon significantly beat the prices at [...] of other places for the same TV. Prices continue to come down.Was afraid it would be too big for my room, so stuck with the 56"" - could have easily fit the 62"" TV there with no problem. Only issue with the 62"" would have been a slightly more expensive warranty. Lots of different options to hook it up including HDMI inputs. Exceptional picture clarity - much brighter than the previous big screen."
5,Great HDTV,Best picture we have seen. Have it for three months now and couldn't be happier. Best price anywhere was Amazon and free shipping was great. Had it in 10 days and they set it up on TV stand.
4,Pleased,"Lexington, KYThis TV is a great value. It has an excellent picture in HD but the only reason it didn't get five stars is because for the non-HD signals, the picture is not as good as some other TV's. Hopefully in the near future, more stations will be available in HD. Also, I worried about some of the reviews from other customers about the trouble they encountered with Eagle Logistics but, I had no such problem and they were very helpful and the TV arrived a day earlier than promised."
4,Love it.,It's been over six months and we love the DLP so far. DVDs are wonderful on it. Easy menus. Very good value.
5,"Beautiful Picture, Great Value.","Traded up from earlier 720p version. Definition, brightness and color outstanding. Delivery was better than promised."
4,"Samsung DLP 56"" HD","The Samsung 56"" DLP HD TV is a very good product. I believe it to be the best value in big screen HD television today. It has the latest resolution ability - 1080p and has a bright and rich color display. The picture can be viewed in a room with any amount of light and the no-glare display is far superior to the screen on plasma units. You get the very most for your money with DLP and Samsung has produced a winner here. The only feature ""missing"" from this model is picture-in-picture. If you must have that feature, look for another model as this one does not have it. Otherwise, it has everything needed for great HD television and is easy to setup and operate. You cannot find a better HD television anywhere near its price range."
5,excellent customers service,The item was exactly what we ordered and J&R gave us a credit for half the shipping when I found out amazon wouldn't have charged us any. Would buy from them again
3,"Samsung HL=S5687W 56"" DLP HDTV",Did not meet my expecations compared to my older Toshiba bought 5 years ago. The sound set at stereo sounds like a mono most probably because of the internal speaker design. The picture sharpness is not as good as the the Toshiba due may be to a single bulb compared to Toshiba's three set of bulbs.Very average as far as I am concern and way overated by review magazines.
1,Good but not great,"HD is bright and sharp on some channels, but show pixels on others. In sports close-ups are great, but the people in the stands are fuzzy and grass is also. Little improvement on just digital stations. It could be my cable, I am switching to Dish to hopefully get a sharper pic.Overall it is stil a good purchase with more HD coming all the time."
4,"Big TV, me like","I ended up purchasing this TV, the 56' version, because a friend of mine from work bought the 61'. So this way I had a chance to see it up close and play various movies/TV/video games. And being that my living room is rather small I decided to get a smaller version of the same model. It works/looks great. I have a playstation 3 hooked up to it via HDMI cable and everything looks amazing. No complaints. Shippings from Amazon was fast, but only if you wait a week, then call and hound the shipping companys. It speeds up the process dramaticly."
5,Top Quality Product ... Great Value!,"Everything about this purchase was outstanding. Amazon's delivery service was on-time, careful and helpful. The TV was easy to set up and worked perfectly from the moment it was hooked up to cable and turned on. I didn't want to play with any picture adjustments because I could only make things look worse. The picture looks great in both daytime light and in the evening. The HD is so good that you really don't want to watch the analog channels. Samsung has definitely got this product right! Also, Amazon's price was the best available. I can't remember too many purchases I've enjoyed more.I suggest that if you are looking for a HD-TV that is 46"" or larger and you are not going to hang it on a wall, then DLP technology is the way to go."
5,#1 Christmas present,I gave 2 of these for Christmas presents. One to a three year old who just loved it and a 16 month old. it was his favorite toy of 6. the hardest thing was to get it out of the package. the boys were very excited to get to the fun.
5,Single best toy purchase I made,"This is actually my first review ever but I just have to say that this toy probably occupies 40-50% of my son's total play hours for the past 2 years. He got this before he was 2 and still uses it every day several times. And this kid has plenty of toys. He ties things to it, rides on it (even though it states that it is not a ride on toy), fills it up with various things, crashes it into things, pushes it, even tries to take it into the tub which we have occasionally allowed. When ever he gets one of us to play trucks with him he will give us another truck and keep this one for himself. I am sure I did not pay $99 dollars for it (why is it so much???) but knowing what I know now about the truck, I would spend that much."
5,Enjoyed by my almost two year old,We bought this for my son at Christmas (22 months) and he loves it - as well as his two other brothers (ages 3 and 4). For a boy who likes trucks - this is definitely a good buy (and durable too).
5,Alot Of Fun...,"I bought this for my son when he was 2, and now almost three (in 3 days) he still plays with it. A good toy at a good price!"
4,A toddler truck lover's dream,"My two-year old grandson is obsessessed with trucks, and this mega-truck fulfills all his requirements."
5,Outstanding learning and entertainment value,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my nieces, ages 2 and 5. Since they visit several times each week, I'm always in the market for new ideas. The Old Red Barn Club is a hit! That's all we watch - we sing along with Pete and the other characters and enjoy seeing how many shapes and colors we can match! It's been a great addition to our library. I hope the producer of this character continues to expand Pete's adventures and as a result, ours! Great job!"
4,Fun bouncing!,"I've bought this product because it's cheap, small, discreet, and apparently easy to assemble. (My brother put it together by himself and he said it's moderately difficult job but definitely doable). It was a huge success in house warming party, 3 little children hopping in at the same time and it handled them well. And it's fun to be bouncing when you're stressed out or feel stiff/need some exercise in a rainy day!"
5,Higly Recommend,I was very impressed with the quality of this Trampoline. All I had to do was unfold and screw on the legs on; tools were not required. The sturdiness of this Trampoline is incredible.
1,Broken in 15 minutes,This item was broken in two places within 15 minutes. Two springs just ripped through the metal frame that was meant to secure the springs. The item says 300 lb weight capacity. My husband weight 190lbs - it broke when he jumped on it only twice.
1,Defective,"The trampoline is not made by company Needak as nowhere on the machine does it state this. In addition, one of the springs flew off after only three weeks of use. I returned the item as soon as that happened."
3,"Instructions.......... not ""common sense""","Love the product, but I have several pieces that came in the box, that I have no idea what to do with... no istructions... no picture of the product with these extra pieces... even contemplating the pieces that look like they would fit together and where the ""holes"" and button's are.... I still have no idea what to do with these pieces."
5,Just what I was looking for,"This little rebounder/trampoline is just what I was looking for. It fits nicely in my bedroom and allows me to jump on whenever I need it. My 3 year old grandson loves it too, although I try to keep him in the middle so he doesn't fly off and hurt himself!"
5,fun for young and old,"Easy to put together, or away if not needed - my grandchildren like it as much as I do.With my 60 years I finally can jump again"
2,Quick lite read but book does not follow TV show,"Anybody who's watched the show and wants to find out more about Felicity & Ben's road trip will disappointed. In this book, she goes to Berlin with Noel!"
1,Who actually wrote this book?,"As an adult fan of the TV show, and a big fan of fiction for young people, all I can say is . . . ouch. How hard can it be to give a character in a book the same voice as the character on television? Evidently, hard indeed."
2,Contradicts storyline,"Everyone knows by now that Felicity chose Ben in the season premier, yet, this book has her picking Noel and describes their summer (which never happened on the show). Read it as fan fiction, nothing else."
4,I really enjoyed it - for the story,"Well first of all in regards to the first review above - this book does NOT ruin the TV show because the book has an opposite plot line that the premeire of the show did. Meaning - she chose the opposite guy in the book. I agree with review #2 that often the dialog does NOT sound like the Felicity we know - but I was still able to enjoy this book. There were some really funny lines, and it was especially interesting to read the ""parallel universe"" storyline. I recommend it!"
2,Nowhere near as good as the TV show,"I am a big fan of Felicity on TV, but this book doesn't comeclose to how good the TV show is. The biggest problem is thatFelicity in the book doesn't sound like Felicity on the show. The dialogue is wrong. Whoever wrote this book needs to study the TV show more."
2,Disappointment,"I'm definitely disappointed in the book. First, the whole Ben/Noel choice doesn't match what happened on the show. In addition, there are other little inconsistencies with the season premiere. The tapes don't sound like Felicity, and there is also a problem with some of the other cast members - especially Elena's attitude about being roommates with Noel (the premiere handled it much more Elena-like). Also, this book is definitely for a mature audience and not for a young adult teenager."
2,"Worst part of show is the tapes, so....?","I can't understand why the tapes would be such a big emphasis of the Felcity books. Anyway, this book does not compare to other books from TV shows, like the recent Dawson's Creek books which are great or even the Sabrina books I used to read. It was okay but not very good."
4,A clear view of the changes in Russian life,"Nancy Traver has used her years of life in Moscow to paint a clear picture of the lives of the Russian people, especially the new generation. She has a good eye and ear for the facts of Russian life and writes in fine journalistic style. After reading this book I know more about Russia than I had read in any newspaper, magazine or book."
4,Makes a lot of sense,"This DVD was very helpfull in understanding modes. It provides some handles to start experimenting and has got examples for each mode. I knew some of the basic stuff beforehand, and this video helped me to get a deeper understaning. There are however still some questions unanswered.Video-quality is not very good (taken from a VHS-source), but that doesnt make the content any less valuable.All in all I can recommend this video to everyone who wants to know about modes! Very clear explanations and examples!"
2,threadbare,"A lot of boys and men love ninjas, so this is a surface-y discussion they might enjoy.Still, they stopped speaking about real ninjas one-third or one-half way into the work. They then move on to the question, ""Are SWAT team members the new ninjas?"" Equating the present to the past help viewers who may get bored. A teacher once asked in a psychology class, ""Are psychologists modern-day shamans?"" There's a popular book equating businessmen of today (purposely gendered) to samurai. Still, this is a cop out in that we have much SWAT footage and little visual imagery of samurai, so of course the makers take the path of least resistance.This work is very Western. Japanese actors may have been used for the cheesy reenactments, but all the interviewees are Western.This work is just scant. There's no two ways about it."
4,Odd but faithful in atmosphere to Poe's magnificent story,"Although the story has been changed slightly and the character of the narrator replaced by a young boy who has a bug-collecting habit passed down onto him from his dead father, the tone of the story is still in tact, and the actor (Roberts Blossom) who plays the man bitten by the Gold-Bug in Poe's original story is excellent to say the least. While certain plot elements have been changed presumably to appeal to a younger viewer (i.e. the viewer's connection to the bug story via a young boy), the essence, tone and atmosphere of Poe's original story remain in tact. The suspense is in the right places. The effects/music are well-placed be they dated. When I purchased this old VHS off eBay I was pleasantly surprised by what I was expecting to be a terribly budget film version of a classic Poe tale. Highly recommended."
4,14k Yellow Gold Apple Charm,"Lovely little apple charm. Just what I wanted. Picture a little deceptive, though. I thought the charm would be larger than it actually was. Otherwise - Great item. I'm happy."
2,Leaves your tan un-even & streaky orange,"This lotion made my skin streaky once I got out of the tanning booth. It made one part of my leg tan and the other part pale. It also left streaks down my leg that were BRIGHT ORANGE. D: I don't reccomend this product, the bronzer rinses right off and your tan fades several hours after tanning.. if you don't moisturize NON-STOP afterwards. I don't think it's worth it so I use Designer Skin Black indoor tanning lotion now and it works SO MUCH BETTER. :)"
5,An excellent product and great value,I've been using this for a couple years now. Recently my local drug store either stopped carrying it or removed it from the shelves due to the off-season.This product works very well for extending or enhancing the tan you might already have or putting down a good base for future tanning.I currently use it 2-3 times a week at my local tanning salon. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't bother my skin at all.I get around 10-12 tans per 8.5 oz bottle. Buying 3 of them should literally keep me covered for several months for a fraction of what tanning salons charge for their products. Highly recommended!
5,Great!,"I've been using this for years. I love tanning indoors and outdoors. This is the only lotion I will use outside. It's amazing and works better than anything else I have ever tried. I don't think it works as best indoors though. Some tanning oils and lotions for outside have given me heat rash but not this one. It smells nice, it's moisturizing and darkens your skin instantly - that's saying a lot for Illinois sun :)"
2,Blahhhh...,"Not at all impressed. This stuff was very watery, and sticky on my skin. I used it twice, and saw no difference in color. Probably would not buy again..."
1,No wonder they sell it at wal mart.,I recently started tanning and didn't want to buy an expensive bottle of lotion. I should've just spent the money because this gave me a RASH all over my body and face. Too bad a tan can't hide my oozing sores! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
1,Very dissapointing,"From reviews and recomendations, I expected a lot from this DVD. When I got it home and watched the first ten mins or so about traditional grip techniques, I got bored. I play match grip.The overall audio level was low. I had to crank my TV to double the normal listening level of 10 to 20!! There are a couple of peak distortion audio splats on loud kick drums etc..I lost interest with Steve's boring explanations. He goes into some gunk on polyrhythms that has no written reference and you can only see his hands. Not for intermediate players.I'll probably fast forward through the rest of it then take it back...."
4,OLFA 12-Inch x 18-Inch,"Product seems to be in good shape and good quality, but it has an objectionable odor. The OLFA web-site will give you directions on how to remove the odor. Most plastic things have a strange odor from the manufacturing process."
4,"Decent mat; beware it is US imperial only, no metric","Bought this mat for electronics assembly, so I don't scratch up the table. It works well enough and seems durable as long as you don't try to roll it up.If you're using this for home/hobby engineering applications, be aware that all the rulers are ONLY in old-style fractional US/imperial. It's not dual imperial/metric like nearly any ruler you would find. If you need metric also shop around more... there's got to be one here with both measurement systems."
5,Nice cutting mat,"I did a lot of comparison shopping before I decided on this mat and I'm very happy with it. It's sturdy, a good size, and a great deal for the price."
2,Meh,"This probably wont last long. I used it with the Olfa deluxe rotary cutter for about 40 cuts and I can see lots of areas where it wont be ""self-healing"". I doubt this will last very long before its covered in ridges and cracks that ruin perfect straight cuts."
3,Cute but come on,Very cute gift idea! I kept the strawberry one for myself and had my 6 year old help w/ the seeds or should I say seed. I opened the seed packet expecting to see several seeds but there were only 2-3 seeds. I would suggest purchasing a package of seeds. Don't put the container outside because if it rains the container doesn't have any drainage holes. Mine is outside with about an inch of water on top of the dirt. They were not kidding when they said not to over water. :)
1,Too much $$,"The best part out of the whole kit I thought was the galvanized tubs, I got the herb seeds, but the strawberry seeds were not in the package, it's pretty pricey when there is a ""Made in China"" sticker on the tub. good luck."
2,Poorly Written,"The author obviously has experience but he cannot express himself in a logical, easy to follow way on paper. This book is painful to read and hard to understand.Definitely not for beginners or someone looking for a basic guide"
4,A great guide for sauces,There are many more sauces than I ever imagined in this book. My husband and I have had a great time choosing an appropriate sauce for whatever meal we are planning. The key is to have a good mother sauce to start with and then you will have a succesful small sauce.
2,Good Sauces--Bad book,"The book presents hundreds of interesting sauces but is not organized in a way that allows you to know what sauce to use and when. Rather than index sauces to match foods, this book presents a small blurb of suggested foods next to each of 600+ receipies. For example, I opened the book at random to a sauces that was recommended for crab cakes. But if I wanted to prepare crab cakes and was looking for a sauce, I would have had to read past 200 pages and 300 recipies before I found this one. The publisher could have spent a few hundred dollars to create an index of sauces that would have increased the value of this book ten fold. Too bad they didn't."
4,This Book is Okay -,"The book is very informative, however, I feel that it could be better written instead of ""Aurora Sauce - Cream based sauce mixed with stewed tomatoes."" Its hard to understand what I, as a budding chef, need to add to it. Do I add it to taste? Do I add a certain amount? It doesn't really specify. I also feel like this book needs pictures. Better pictures than the diagrams, those are okay, but it needs pictures of what the sauces look like. That's what I would recommend."
5,"""A Gallery Of Classics""",Absolute centerpiece of my desk at work! I have numerous co-workers coming by every day to check out the classics. The quality of the photos are amazing. A unique gift for the young and old alike.
5,A Car Lovers Calendar,"As a confirmed car lover I looked for quite a long time for a desk calendar about cars. I just ordered two 2006 Cars Gallery Calendar, one for myself and one for a Christmas present for a good friend who is a car buff, also. The photographs are outstanding."
3,Legendary my ass,This CD is good but it's not worth the money. I mean it really is just a greatest hits CD that was never released in the states. Although it does have many of the groups classic there are some stinkers also. To be truthful I have only listened to the CD once since I bought. It really did not motivate me to listen to it again. It will probably sit in the CD rack collecting dust for a long time!
5,Comprehensive no frills budget release,"This 3CD set in the ""Legendary"" series is probably the best ""value for money"" buy for Hall & Oates fans who want to have all of the group's key RCA recordings in one place but who aren't too fussy with the sound quality or product packaging. As a no frills budget release, ""Legendary"" offers only the basics. The tracks aren't digitally remastered. There is only a track listing on rather cheap glossy paper but no liner notes. But whereas the other ""best of"" compilations cover only their biggest and most obvious hits, ""Legendary"" includes the smaller ones as well as notable ""B"" sides and album cuts. A great buy for budget conscious fans."
5,Women Who Kept the Lights.,"Women Who Kept the Lights is an excellent book. The stories are informative, entertaining and well written. The photos and illustrations are rare and of good quality."
4,Very refreshing change,"I've bought both Storey's DVDs and what I like about them is her energy and obvious enthusiasm for teaching. She looks great (and you'll love the British accent!!) and she is very clear to explain the moves. I've been to different classes over the years and can't remember any teacher really taking the time Storey does to explain how the movements are performed. There's no history, philosophy or endless lists of credentials like you see on other DVDs...just the moves, which was a welcome change."
4,Justice League Ulimited not Original,"As this is an awsome product, it is not the original 10"" Wonder Woman released. The Original has a photo of the original 7 heros on the front and says just Justice League."
4,Adorable,Didn't give 5 stars because I gave it as a gift and don't know how durable it is. The new mother loved it though.
5,I love Strawberry Shortcake!!,"I love Strawberry Shortcake, and have enjoying it for 20 years since I was a young girl. I was so excited they re-released it and could not wait to buy it. I just received this new doll and - it's great!!! A+++++++"
2,"Looks good, walks hard...","Bought this shoe from Zappo's abut two years ago....Love the color; not very comfortable for walking. Typically Arche shoes are extremely comfortable, but this is the exception. Looks great when you wear it with a summery dress and fling one leg over the other in a lawn chair...."
1,Stop Playin!,aight im from Chicago but letz be real! album is WACK! most of tha time he rhymez off stretchin wordz that aint an m.c. sum of tha beatz is straight but they used them on tha wrong dude. DO NOT buy this album. commercial garbage!
3,An ok album,"This album was ok i just didn't like most of the beats on it, i like white boy's flow, but not the production. when i first heard the song Can't get out the game i was impressed by his flow and the way he rapped, it was the only song that had a good beat to it.but overall the album was ok but not the production of it."
1,5 STAR REVIEWS? DID WE LISTEN TO THE SAME ALBUM?,"I never write reviews personally, but when I came across this album and saw the 5 star rating I had to let the truth be known. So i'm sure the question is, have i listened to the album? The answerer is, unfortunately yes. ""White Boy"" has no flow, his rhymes are terrible, and he can barely hang with the beat. The album does have simi-decent production, even Kanye West got on this peace of garbage. White's rhymes defiantly show that he does listen to rap, because he bites several lines from many main stream rappers. There are many reasons you have never heard any good things about this album and I have covered a few.So if your looking for a wack album where a ""white boy"" that completely lacks all rapping ability and drops the N word on almost every track, this is the album for you."
4,A must for anyone interested in the story,"I've long wanted to read a straight forward telling of the Maranello house story, and here I found it. Warmly recommended to anyone with a true interest in this area of the Ferrari history. i'm not sure all is correct, but it's a hell of a read."
2,Good photos terrible editing,"Any Ferrari book will have the colorful pics (some of which come from other books I have on Ferrari), but the errors in text and misplaced photos are far too numerous for any book. The section on the 550 has photos of F50 and 512TR. It almost looks like the book was never proof-read. Ferrari enthusiasts will find the errors immediately and it is very disconcerting. One or two goofs is acceptable but this is systemic. Shame, because it could be a nice little page turner."
2,Eddie Bauer Boo Boo,This was by far the worst product Eddie Bauer has made. I have three children and have been a Eddie Bauer die-hard fan but this chair was awful. My 6months old son hates it. In the beginning the noise scared him and he instantly cried when I sat him in it. As he crew older he was just plain bored by it and I was afraid it wasn't gonna hold his weight which is just now 16lbs. I registered for it because it match the bassinet and the swing by Eddie Bauer but it wasn't worth the 60 bucks my friends paid for it... I say Boooooo to this one. But I'm still a die hard fan because they make some great quality merchandise
1,Just not right...,"I also loved the idea for this product. My daughter was born in July and I liked the idea of her napping in it on our porch with the netting all zipped up. However, the seat never supported her enough. She wasn't a very big or a very small baby, but she kept falling over to one side in the seat. And the toys - and what they are attached to - were always out of her reach, but in her line of sight. When she could support herself better, she was too tall for it. The cool tent feature makes the babies outgrow it so much more quickly than a regular open bouncy seat. I ended up leaving it at my mom's for a ""back up"". And for the price compared to other bouncy seats (like the $20 one I bought and my daughter loved), it was a big time waste of money."
3,not so bouncy,My baby is almost 3 months old and just now will tolerate this seat. He weighs 13 lbs. and the seat creaks every time I sit him in it. He was bored with the plain toys this comes with so I bought bright colored toys to replace them. The zipper broke on the canopy the 1st time I tried to use it.
1,my baby hated the tan version of this bouncer,"i just want to point out that the seat is FLAT and HARD,it doesn't sit up very much and the strap is too small for a 2 month old. also my baby screams when he is in it, because it is very uncomfortable. i recomend the baby papasan bouncer or the swing version. actually or just about any bouncer. my baby has and likes: infant to toddler rocker, aquarium take along swing, baby papasan seat, aquaruim bouncer and papasan swing PLEASE DONT BUY THIS IT IS VERY UNCOMFY FOR MY BABY AND EVERY BABY THAT HAS COME TO PLAY GROUP. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Good product but not for me,"I really like this bouncenette but foudn that I didn't use it very much. The zip around bug screen was wonderful when sitting out on the deck in the summer. I wouldn't have asked for it if I had known that I wasn't going to use it a lot, I feel like I wasted my friend's money on it."
2,broken bouncer,"Our baby loved this bouncers vibrate and sound features. However, the vibrating feature is already broken (our baby is 7 weeks old). In addition we had to add a sleep positioner so he wouldn't tip to the side. The adjustable postioning is nice and he does still use it to listen to the nature sounds."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"This bouncer was recommended to me in the store, but when I got it home and put it togther, I was not impressed. The assembly wsan't all that easy and the ""soothing sounds"" were more like white noise with the occasional bird chirping. After walking by it for two days I finally decided to return it for the Baby Einstein model."
2,My child outgrew it too quick,"After six weeks, my son outgrew this. It's great for newborns...it kept him quiet when I took a shower and is great for putting it right outside the door but now he's two months and is too big for it. He's average weight and height."
1,Terrible,"this seat is terrible, baby tips to the side, there is nothing to keep their attention and once the baby was like 2 months old, he was too big for it. we have all the other eddie bauer products and they are great, but this one they should just get rid of."
3,"Loved the concept, my baby hated it","If you are an outdoorsy type, then this is perfect! My daughter hated any bouncing, shaking, vibrating things. I liked it because it actually didnt let the bees in there and boy were there alot of them in my best friends backyard! I also went to the park alot and this was my sidekick. Although it is bulky to carry, if you own a car.. its ok"
2,very disappointed,I was very disappointed with this seat. Every time I tried to put my daughter hated it. It is not stimulating at all!!! Very boring color. Does not bounce much and and the outdoor noises are awful. It just took space up in my house. I plan on selling it at a garage sale.
1,I give this product 1 star only because you can't choose 0 stars,"This product caught my eye when I was pregnant and thought the idea of the mesh netting was great. After the baby came, I attempted to put her in it and the strap was too tight. I persisted and tried to use it but after she was 4 weeks old it became impossible to use. She was too tall at 4 weeks old to sit in it, her head would have to be tilted to the side in order to put her in it. I then contacted the manufacturer and they were not any help to me. They said they never heard of anyone having trouble with the product and it really wasn't their problem that she was too big for the seat. I tried her in other bouncy chairs and she fits just fine. Well like me they obviously missed all these BAD reviews. I wish I had seen them earlier. I never would have put the product on my baby registry."
1,One of our WORST purchases,"My husband and I read all of the poor reviews on this product, and we really should have listened to them! However, we were drawn to the bouncenette's pretty neutral color and seeming usefulness. We were wrong--it wasn't useful. Here's a list of all that we found wrong with this bouncenette:*When our baby was a newborn, she wasn't properly supported by the seat, and would end up in very weird positions (head near the bottom of the seat, slumped over to the side, etc...) while sleeping. We thought of placing towels or blankets on either end, but that didn't seem safe.*The vibration is weak.*The toys are very boring and out of the baby's reach, which is pointless.*It's awkward to carry around.*After only two months, we coudn't find any use for this product.We went back to the store and bought the Ocean Wonders bouncer, which is cheaper and a much better product. Listen to the reviews--don't waste your money."
5,King of the entry-level hill,"These Creative HQ-140s pretty much nail every category. First and foremost, they sound great -- balanced, crisp, powerful -- not flat and boring like sets from Sony and JVC I recently owned. Koss headphones sound pretty good, but mine just crapped out after five months (pretty common, I've learned) so I'm not going down that road again. Don't have much faith in Philips or RCA, and most of the rest are no-name brands.They also look good, fit well, and the single-sided cord keeps things nice and untangled. They make a nice aesthetic match for my Creative Zen player, too. Among open-air headphones with 30mm drivers, I really can't imagine things getting much better... in fact, the only set that could beat this is probably the Sennheiser PX-100 (haven't tried), but hey we're talking $15 against $50 here.Act fast if you want one; these seem to have been discontinued sometime during summer 2011."
1,Most uncomfortable headphones ever,These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn or tried to use. In a very short time they will cause excruciating pain on parts of your ear no matter how they are moved. They will also squeeze your head to the point where you will feel it is being squeezed in a vice and there is no way to make any adjustments.
4,"Cool,good,verygood","Good game. I was kind of skeptical of mortal kombat taking the game into the PSP, but it looks good on the psp. Graphics are good, but the loading is worse than the PS2 version. Overall, it is good and the developers should consider making another one on the PSP. Original."
2,mortal kombat unchained,look this is not really a good game i orderd it and played it once and was done with it maybe cuz im not a die hard mortal kombat fan so maybe just one for the fans
3,"NOT GREAT, HARD TO PLAY","I bought this game because i used to play MK when i was a teen, turns out is not that fun, and is kind of hard to win, the combos are hard to pratice... graphics are ok is a psp not a ps3, it didnt bother me but it was not the quality i expected."
3,almost as good as the ps2,My son says this is is almost as good as the ps2 version and that it has more characters.It is bloody so not for young kids.
2,Worse than the PS2 version.,"This game is a crappy crossover to the psp. If you want this game, buy Deception on the ps2. Its graphics are not choppy, and the controls are responsive unlike the psp version."
4,Power-Glide Junior Adventure,"My son is starting the Power-Glide Ultimate Adventure. He is in 5th grade. It has taken him 2 months to almost complete the hole program. He has enjoyed the Adventure with the two kids. This program is not for anyone who is older than 6th grade. This is one program that we can not turn off, so it has been worth it. He prefers this program over Rosetta Stone, but we will be using that program next year. We are using these programs for homeschool."
2,Confusing,"It was kind of hard to find what you were supposed to listen to in the CD. They also mixed Spanish and English together in sentences. I think it is best to make the whole sentence in Spanish. It makes it easier to understand. On the songs, the words did not fit with the rhythm of the music. They also should have used native Spanish speakers because it would have been more accurate. But the stories were good for people who love mysteries."
1,Could not operate the new two toned pump,I bought the new 40 oz shampoo and conditioner. My wife and I could not figure out how to release the new two toned pump. There are no directions and we tried everything we could think of. Ridiculous marketing or we just happened to get two bad pumps on two different products. I think not.
3,okay but not worthy of higher than 3 1/2,i liked this movie. it did have flaws. very many flaws. it was fun and cool otherwise.
3,"pretty good rental, but don't buy it","I made a mistike and bought this movie, thinking with jammie foxx it would be so funny i would watch it many time's, which i haven't, this is not to say it is a bad movie, it has some good action and some pretty funny scene's, but i wish i would have rented it. p.s jammie foxx's commentery is pretty dry he doesn't say much for long period's of time, then when he does it is something you already know"
4,Bait,"I really liked this movie Bait. I never heard of it and saw it. it's funny, heart warming and action filled. it's good for men and women. Jamie Foxx is awesome in this movie."
5,comedy central,this is to me an action oriented movie with lots of laughs with actors who are now 'stars.'
3,Not as bad as I was expecting....,"Let me first say that I love Jamie Fox. I was expecting a sorry plot line that would rely on a couple of special effects and Jamie Fox humor.Instead I got a cross between ""Enemy of the State"" and ""Booty Call"". Don't get me wrong...it's not as funny as ""Booty Call""; nor is it as sophisticated (technology-wise) as ""Enemy of the State"". It has a nice mix of both however. If you try not to overanalyze some of the computer stuff (which does play a big part) and just enjoy Jamie Fox as having more to offer than just comedy you'll like this movie.Antoine Fuqua's style is very familiar and I had a lot of flashbacks to his previous work in ""Replacement Killers"" with Chow Yun Fat and Mira Sorvino.I was entertained by this movie and you will be too IF you don't think too hard. Enjoy. I'd give it a B- (81/100)"
1,Really bad quality,I bought a ping pong net from them and I tried to set it up the first thing that happened was the net got torn.
1,No instructions will arrive with purchase,This set does not come with instructions to put it together. A complete waste of money!!!
1,This Book is Horrible,"This book was not helpful at all. I take substitute teaching and education seriously. I was looking for real activities that I could use when the teacher did not leave plans or if I had a few minutes to spare. The activities were not original or helpful.Additionally, the pages looked like a child designed them. It was not professional. Neither was the publishing. Much of the ink was faded."
1,What a disapointment!,"I was so disapointed when I received this book and started going through it. The pages were childish, the activities (if you could call them that) were absolutly stupid! Out of the entire book I could maybe use 3 or 4 in a real substitute teaching situation. Maybe a regular teacher could use some of the ideas, but I'm a substitute teacher and there is no way that you could use these so called activities. I am so disapointed and don't recommend this to any substitute teacher. Poor contents and poorly illustrated :("
3,Good,This book has a lot of great ideas and little games which come in handy as lesson breaks for a full time teacher and also a lot of these fun games that will make you be the fun casual teacher
3,Mystery - With a Touch of Romance,"This book is about two law enforcement officers who discover that they love each other. It took 194 pages (317 page book) before you realized that a romance was budding between the two officers. There was somewhat of a hint before that, but not much. These officers are trying to solve a series of murders on Capital Hill and that seems to be the main focus. I would prefer ROMANCE with a touch of MYSTERY. I was really bored reading this but I was trying to get to the good part. It's not entirely a bad read but I couldn't get into it like I usually do. Maybe it's me."
5,Truth and Beauty put to music,"Danny Peck moves the listenter to tap a foot, snap a finger and shake a hip to music that inspires the soul as well as the body. His creative lyrics convey human truths and convictions while his music grooves your soul. Danny's heartfelt vocals touch the deepest recesses of the human experience. If you're tired of the meaningless mass of songs that say nothing, listen to ""Love Politico"" and your faith in truth will be restored."
1,Not quite factual,"I know the person in this book, ""Dan""', as he is called. The stories in the book are a bit one-sided. For example, at one point the author states that Dan has gone to play D&D; with friends, but that she knows he is really having an affir. I was at those games and I am quite sure there were no affairs occurring.The stugggle with her problems is perhaps worth the read, but please keep in mind that ""Dan"", as she calls him, is actually a good guy.You might consider changing the cover of the book too. It is nearly impossible to read, even in person."
1,doesnt fit my big head,"Deccent sound at modest volumes but a mess at higher volumes, particularly the base. What's worse however is the fit, they pop off at any movement and dont block out ambient noise-not very useful at the gym for example. Altec can do better."
1,Very Uncomfortable & Awkard,"I expected more from an Altec Lansing product. I was very disappointed that they were so awkward and uncomfortable on my head. As the other reviews have said, the sound quality is poor and they pop off my head if I try to wear them at the gym. Basically, I tried wearing them for 2 days but ended up returning them (paying for shipping of course) and buying a better made product for the same price."
2,Good...Until they Break,"These have been nice headphones until recently...because of there simple and light design, they broke on me (the left speaker was crushed). Just to make sure (because they are pointless now) i tested the strength on the other speaker, and it gave way easily...Don't EVER put these in an bag, which is anoying because i use headphones a lot and put them in a bag (backpack) when i'm done.As for when I did have the phones, the treble was extreme and crisp, but for the bass i had to turn it up on the equalizer in my Sony Walkman, to hear any bass."
2,Not good for beginners,"I am very disappointed by this DVD. The production quality is terrible (like watching a home video), the instructions are not clear and are hard to follow. I am a beginner and wanted to learn how to do Tai Chi. This is not the dvd for that!"
5,Best T'ai Chi DVD I've bought,"I spend a lot of money on t'ai chi videos and dvds. Most of them are performed by middle-aged men who don't relate to me - the viewer - at all. I liked Jayne Storey's video because she seems to talk to and be interested in the people she's teaching. All the other so called 'masters' may be doing better tai chi according to some reviewers, but hey, I'd rather watch someone I can relate to as a human being. Storey's a great teacher. She's warm and seems genuinely ""into"" her art. If you want ""pretentious"", sure there are other dvds...but this is a real woman teaching real tai chi to real people. Go ahead and buy it."
5,Finaly a Great Tai Chi DVD for Women,"I've been looking for a Tai Vhi DVD in the Yang Form for ages, this is it. Everything about it is really nicely done... I even took TV outside one day and practiced in the Garden... That was the best. LOL"
4,Great Little Heart Monitor,"This is a nice little model for women. I was worried about the screen being too large -when it arrived I found that it's slightly bigger than a watch I would wear, but not a cumbersome size at all -the screen is approximately an inch in diameter. It doesn't have a stopwatch. It doesn't have GPS. The beeping to tell you that you are going too hard/too slow is loud enough that I can hear it over my headphones (at a reasonable volume) and the pitch is not annoying! The transmitter is very thin and comfortable to wear for at least an hour or so. There are a lot of storage data functions to keep track of all your stats. I was tempted to shell out the extra cash for the hot newer red model, but decided that it wasn't worth it for the extra $100 -I was right. Now someone just has to make one with GPS that's small enough for a women to wear."
2,NOT ACCURATE,"The time, date and alarm works on this POLAR watch, but in terms of tracking calories burned this watch has missed the mark.I comapre calories burned on the watch indicator to calories burned on a Polar machine and it is so off kilter in terms odf #'s.I could burn 320 calories running for 30 minutes, but the watch will read 109 calories burned. I have reset all the settings and put my accurate ht and wt in along with my age and it still doesn't work."
1,Quality is suspect!,Had to return the Polar F6 twice over the year. First one of the buttons would fall off and then it would stop working. This is only from Zumba and treadmill. Would not purchase again.
1,Sick of Polar,This is my third polar watch. This particular watches screen went blank in 4 months after purchase. I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this watch. I wont send it back to get charged 'around' 75 bucks and I wont buy another polar branded watch.
2,The HR monitor that keeps taking (your money!),"I was very happy with my Polar F6 Heart Rate Monitor when it first arrived. It worked great and I love the features, so that's not the problem. The problems are 1) the strap (especially around the loop that holds the thing around your chest) is crap and tends to break, needing ongoing replacements, 2) when the honeymoon has worn off and the batteries need replacing, Polar takes more money from you than seems reasonable to change a darn battery, 3) after said honeymoon ending, the transmitter also starts to stutter and you'll find yourself adjusting and re-adjusting and wetting for suction to try to get the right reading going.In conclusion, you'll be happy at first, and then you won't be so happy."
2,"Poor Display, Low beep volume","The heart monitor and watch work fine BUT the display is grainy, small, and hard to see. Far cheaper monitors and watches have far better, brighter, bigger displays.And - the beeps to warn that you have gone above or below your heart range are so low that there is no way to hear them on the exercise floor! You have to keep the unit to your ear to hear them.People recommended this so I bought this but I am not happy with this unit."
3,KEEP QUIET!,"I use this heart rate monitor for my Bikram Yoga class. I think its accurate and comfortable to wear. However, I have the alarm sound turned to off and also the heart rate alarm turned to off and the stupid thing keeps beeping in the middle of my class!This is a yoga class and requires quiet. I called Polar customer service and they weren't of much assistance, besides telling me to ship it back to them (at my own expense, of course).Other than the beeping issue, I do like the monitor and feel its pretty accurate. I just wish it would shut-up."
3,Does NOT have a STOPWATCH W/SPLITS (Laps),"This monitor is loaded with with stuff but doesn't have a runner's stopwatch - a big downer since I run and would have to wear a second watch to record splits. I am deciding whether or not to keep it for a few reasons - 1. the stopwatch - you can only record your length of time working out; you can not record splits/laps. 2. it's kind of an ugly pink - I am thinking one of the darker colors would be better, and it's much bigger than I had expected. It's a tough call though, since I work out at the gym a lot and like the idea that it doesn't have ""cross talk"" and it is loaded with other features. Just keep the stopwatch factor in mind if you are a runner considering this product - FYI the F4 is cheaper and has the stopwatch. UPDATE - I returned this, bought the F4 and have been very happy with it, I use it at the gym and have no cross talk problems, swim with it also."
1,I must have received a defective one,"I am an older woman (63). I am very active and was quite curious about how many calories I actually burn. I purchased this to make sure I did not ""overdo"" with my heart and for the calorie number. It worked (somewhat) on day one and then quit. I tried on two more consecutive days but to no avail. It just would not pick up my heart beat properly....it would register 0 and then a few minutes later, 172, a number that is too high for me. I returned it and did not want the hassle of trying another. I have not purchased a replacement."
4,First Experience is a good one,"This was my very first heart rate monitor and I chose Polar based on several personal recommendations, I've used it for 3 weeks now. It's comfortable to wear, easy to use and very consistent. I didn't want to spend the money but I'm glad I did since I was suprised to find out I have been working out of the zone the majority of my 45-60 minute session. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to fine tune and maximize their fat loss efforts."
5,too cool,"This is an awesome HRM. I Love it. I Got the Pink One. It works great and even gives out a report at End, showing calories Burned etc. I never realized just How ""OFF"" the calorie counter was On My treadmill. This HRM, allows you to enter Height weight etc so You get accurate totals. I LOVE IT. It also beeps if You go below the target heart Rate or Above it so it keeps You in ""THE ZONE"". Good Purchase Im Glad I got this!"
4,Works great! My clients love it.,I ordered this monitor for my personal training clients and they found it easy to use.
2,Polar's don't last long,"This is my third polar and probably last. Bought this one in July 06 and it got condensation under the face and then died. Disappointing for having it only 9-10 months. I rarely used it for water sports and it did this after working out on a hot, sunny day. The same thing happened on the other two."
4,Great Watch,"Really like this watch. It's fairly basic (just measures time, heart rate and calories), but is exactly what I was looking for. The heart rate monitor is very accurate. It's extremely easy to use, and affordable. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not measure your distance travelled (although there is an accessory pedometer). Would recommed!"
4,On the right track,"I purchased this heart monitor never having used one before. It was easy to set up and is very easy to use. My only issue with this monitor is that the watch is fairly bulky, but it is made of durable materials that will not break easily. Good product."
5,Awesome watch,"I really like this watch. I'm always satisfied with my orders from Amazon. I really the features of this watch. It does everything I need it to do. The watch keeps track of my progress, and keeps me motivating in reaching my goals. Love it. Thanks!"
5,Great tool,I bought this for my wife. She has been using for over two months and still raves how much she likes it after each workout.
2,Pink? How to keep it clean???,"Love the features on this watch, but the band is made of a poreous synthetic material that is impossible to clean. I now have a two-toned watch--pretty soft pink casing with a discolored greyish pink band. Does anyone know how to clean this??? Buy this and you will soon be shopping for a basic black replacement."
4,"Great product, color not so good","The product is great, I use it everytime I work out,The only but I find is that I wish I've known that was going to get so dirty, I can't take the dirt off and it doesn't look so nice anymore even though I clean it over and over, I think next time I'll buy a different color"
3,Monitar review,Works pretty good when it works. Sometimes it dosen't work right away and then will all the sudden start working 5-10 minutes into the workout. Other then that my wife loves it and is very happy.
5,Love this HRM,I have had this hrm now for about a month and love it. I haven't had any problems with it at all. I had never used one before and it was very easy to program. I would buy it again and just sent a link for my sister to look at it to buy.
4,love having an hrm,"A book I read recommended using an hrm (Younger Next Year for Women). I wish it were cheaper and had different colors, but I love using an hrm to exercise. Directions were easy to follow to set up and the strap fits comfortably. There may be other bells and whistles that I will want in the future, but for now this is great. I only use the actual hrm and then look at the calories once I'm done and cry because of the inverse relationship between time and calorie intake/expenditure, but hey, that's my problem!"
1,Terrible customer service,"I bought this heart monitor on the recomendation of a friend who has one. Unfortunately the company (Joma) did not allow for a size selection. They sent a M which would not fit me. I called the customer service number to try and exchange it for a larger size. It took 25 min to get through only to be told that was ""the only one we had"". I then asked how to go about returning it, and was told I had to print out a form and mail it in for a ""return code"". However they only allow returns 30 days from when they shipped it to me, and since they took 3 weeks to get it here, and a week to respond to my email so that time is gone now. I would strongly recommend trying a different vendor of the item. Which looks like it would work great...if only it was my size."
3,"I wanted to love these, I did, but the batteries die fast!","I have been working out daily for more than a decade and I love using heart rate monitors. I used to have a polar maybe about 7 years ago and didn't enjoy it much... Then I tried other brands but after years, the straps would get brittle and I had to replace them...So, I bought this heart rate monitor. I loved it a lot, especially the features, how you can program your own heart rate zones and calories burned! The color made me feel so girly too even though I'm using my athletic wear and lifting weights. This heart rate monitor didn't have a problem with other gadgets being around and that also made me love it a lot!... Then after 2 months, the battery died! Agh. That really made me feel so sad especially when you have to send it back to Polar just to have the batteries changed. Was it just my watch, this model, or Polar..? Well, I wouldn't want to take my chances. Next time, I'm getting another brand :(."
1,Wrong shapes,"I, too, didn't receive the leaves pictured in the product description. I'm not happy with the shapes, but I need to make cookies tonight and have no other choice. Not happy at all."
2,Not the leaves pictured!,"I did not receive the leaves pictured in the product description. I received a small oak leaf, a three-leaf clover and a Canadian maple leaf. The cutters were of decent quality, though and I would like to have exchanged them for the leaves pictured, but it wasn't an option. I just returned them for a full refund."
5,great find!,"all i knew about buddy rich was that he played the drums & used to be on the tonight show with bad hair a long time ago. I've been on a big band kick lately and saw this cd listed cheap so i thought, ""the price is right, give mr. rich a try."" well, wow! this is a powerhouse of a recording. I enjoyed it immensely and highly, highly recommend it. there is some music hear that is as much jazz-rock fusion as it is big band jazz, and that's fine. i consider this a permanent household item now. pure energy to be unleashed whenever a dose is needed."
2,Not Good for Gaming/Movies,"If you play games or watch movies on your monitor this is NOT the monitor for you. I bought the Costco version (VL1916). It is identical to the LCD19D (except the 19D has a 3 year warranty instead of 1 for the VL1916). The response time is 25ms which is too slow for gaming and/or video. There is a LOT of ghosting when playing games and enough while watching movies that I found it annoying and had to return the unit.Be careful when you read reviews of LCD monitors by end users. Most people don't judge them very carefully, they're just impressed by the bright, sharp pictures.For everyday use (browsing the web, reading email, Word, Excel, etc.) this monitor is fine. It does have bright (very bright) colors and the display is sharp. However I would strongly recommend getting an LCD with a 16ms or lower refresh rate for gaming and/or video."
1,Rebate Scam - Buyer Beware,"Purchased this back in January 2005 because of the 100 rebate offered at the time. Submitted the rebate straight away and per the website, it had been approved and sent by mid-March. It's now June and no rebate.Other than this scam, the monitor is good. Just don't expect to get the rebate."
3,"Good vacuum, bad hose design and materials","Hose has broke off of the both flanges (the vacuum flange first, and now the broom side as well) after a 1.5 years of very light use (2 br apartment, 900 sq.ft.). I am totally unimpressed by the hose design: poor choice of materials (too long, and too stiff) and ill engineering (the flanges).The rest of the unit is actually quite good: cleans well, HEPA filter works as intended (some people just don't get it because it has separate air flow for cooling, which is good). Motor brush is good, and I never had to clean it as it apparently does not get clogged - nice... and we both have long hair and two cats that constantly beat each other up and leave lots of fur in the process.So... three stars, with caution. I'll get to find out how good the warranty is by trying to get a replacement hose. Will report on that one later."
3,Works good but disappointed in life of product,"I bought this toothbrush almost exactly a year ago, and it's my first Sonicare. At first, it held its charge up to two weeks and I had zero problems. I replaced the brush heads every three or so months, and my teeth have never felt cleaner! Within the last few months, I have noticed the time span between charges has gotten shorter. Now, I can only go 2 days between charges. I can start to brush my teeth, but after about 15 seconds, my toothbrush will turn off. I'm super disappointed!I guess I'm lucky that I only spent around $50 (plus the cost of replacement heads) on this toothbrush. I can say that I am addicted to my Sonicare, so I will be buying another (better) model, but will be saving the box and warranty information this time around. It is a really great product overall."
4,Just what I was looking for...,I wanted an electric toothbrush and this one has worked out perfectly. No complaints. I like that it came with a travel case and that it has a 2 minute timer. I received it quickly. So far. So good.
2,Sonicare electric toothbrush,"I had a Sonicare toothbrush for many years and loved it. The battery finally gave out and I needed a new one. Several of the new ones come with 2 handles but I just wanted the basic one with no bells and whistles. I purchased an ordinary rechargeable toothbrush but it is much heavier than my original one and although it shuts off after 2 minutes, it doesn't pause every 30 seconds like my original one. I would take a pass on this one."
3,Issues,"Performs well, but under the brushhead fills up with disgusting gunk and the entire unit yellows over time -- quite noticeable after a couple years, especially when you replace the brush head with a pristine white one."
5,Love it,"I purchased this Sonicare to replace one I had used for almost 10 years ... lots of improvements over a decade. The slim neck has a slight angle, making it really easy to get behind the back molars, and I'm very happy with the upgrade."
4,Sonicare (essence),"I had been using an Oral-B brush for several years, and when it died on me, my dentist recommended I buy a Sonicare. I have been using it now for about two weeks, and find, although it takes getting used to, it's a step up for ones teeth and gums. Glad I bought it."
1,Too expensive to break so quickly,"We purchased this item only a few weeks ago and it already has stopped working properly. After a full recharge it stops numerous times in the middle of a brush and then indicates that it needs to be recharged again after only one use. I went to the Phillips Sonicare website to try to get help and after two tries at using their live chat, gave up when no one answered. Calling customer service was abandon after they required serial numbers, date of purchase etc. that I no longer have easily available. The cost of this product is too high for it to have shoddy workmanship and then have no easy recourse for replacement or repair when it fails to work this quickly. Amazon's return policy is also too limited for this type of product as the only way to return it at this point is to pay for shipping and then only get a partial refund. I want it replaced with a decent product, not to have to pay more.Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush, White"
5,The best investment in your health you'll ever make,"I bought my first (and only) Sonicare several years ago and it's still going strong and doing its duty twice a day.After using a Sonicare, a regular toothbrush seems absolutely primitive. If I forget to pack the Sonicare on an overnight trip, a regular toothbrush is akin to stone tools and bear skins and I can't wait to get back to my Sonicare. It'll tickle for the first week or so, but after that you'll kick yourself for not getting one sooner."
4,Nice cheap option,"While not as nice as the elite series, it offers the same head at a low price.It's a good value, but how much more should a slightly nicer shaped handle cost you?"
5,Must have,"I've been using Sonicares for well over a decade now, and I wouldn't use anything else. After 10 years, my first Sonicare's battery final gave out (not bad) and I got the 5300 as a replacement. The head is slimmer and tilted and much easier to use that the original. If you use it right (2 minutes, 30 seconds on each quadrant, at a slight angle, 2x day) your teeth will be perfectly clean. My dental hygienist always comments how she can barely find any plaque or tartar and how easy her job is. You'll appreciate it too, your teeth will feel ultra-smooth. Well worth it. Now if they could just drop the price of the consumable heads I would be a bit happier - but that is a separate review."
4,Great Toothbrush,This is a great toothbrush especially for a thorough cleaning for those with sensitive gums/teeth. The only thing it does not have that would be nice is the quadpacer.
5,Second time around,We've used a Sonicare for about 10 years. Visited Europe recently. Plugged in the charger and fried it. Not dual voltage as most electronics are today. Time for a new unit anyway.
3,Sonicare Essence,Note that this model does not have the quad-pacer feature which pauses every 30 seconds but it is the cheapest.
3,My Mistake,"This was a replacement for a previous Sonicare that wore out. I naively assumed this model was the same as my old one. It does not have the ""quadpacer"" feature, ie. 30 second timer. ALWAYS READ THE FINE PRINT is the lesson learned. Otherwise a great product."
3,Expensive Refills,"This product works great but expect to spend a lot on replacement toothbrush refills. Less expensive aftermarket toothbrush refills are not available to work with the main unit. You will need a bare minimum of 4 refills per year so expect to spend quite a bit more money brushing your teeth than you used to spend if you presently use traditional, manual toothbrushes. You will have to decide if it is worth it to you. The product does a great job in my opinion, but it is not cheap when you consider the cost of refills."
4,Works for me,"I've been using it for about a month, and so far, it's doing the job I expected. No complaints."
4,Significantly better than a manual brush,This was my first electric toothbrush and I've been very impressed by the performance of this compared to manual brushing.
5,absolutely great!,"Thought the battery operated tooth brushes worked great until I got this power toothbrush. Wow, what a difference. My dental office has been urging me to buy one. Now that I have this, I will be buying one for everyone in the family."
5,"A ""no frills"" version that brushes just as well...","I did quite a bit of research before I bought this model, and what I came away with before buying was that this model will brush your teeth just as well as any model that costs much more simply because it pulses at the same speed. What you are giving up by paying much less for this model are such extras as fancy lights, slightly easier controls, etc. Because I did not need any such features, I decided to go with this model.After brushing with it for a few months, I can say that I am very happy with my purchase. I had used a much more expensive Oral-B one before this one, and they brush the exact same way. The Oral-B has one more button and one more light. Other than that, there is no reason to pay fifty or even a hundred dollars more. The battery lasts for over 2 weeks with no problem, but I usually charge it every few days just because I see no reason not to."
4,Sonic Care Toothbrush,"This was a replacement for a basic Sonic Care electric toothbrush, so I knew what to expect. Same timed brushing, same features of brush head etc. Nothing fancy, just basic which is exactly what I wanted. The last last I had for at least 5 years, and the button no longer engaged. No way to fix and no way to get replacement that would continue to use the perfectly good charger I still had (that's disappointing as the new one had a different charger base that would not fit my old unit-so I had to toss away.) Good news is that the stash of brush heads I had could be used on the new unit. This works as advertised."
2,Works okay but not as good as the oral B,"The replacement brushes were harder to find and more expensive than some of the other brands. In the long run,, this unit ends up costing you more than you might expect. The performace was okay but not the best I have used. I dont recommend this product."
2,Disappointed!,"The product, which is my second one, is fine, with the exception that, although I thought I ordered it with, it actually came without the 30 second timer which is on some of the units. So I'm stuck with a toothbrush which irritates me every time I use it! Oh well, george"
1,LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I was ordering ONE tooth brush. Instwad I got TWO, I had started an ordwer and stopped but your system put in the order without my knowledge. Needless to say I was quite pertutbed, your customer servoce ?? finally allowed me to return both but then did not return all my money. REMOVE MY NAME from anything dealing with your company. Your questionable custmoner service is vey difficult to find out how contact. Be sure I will and have related my experience with amazon."
2,"2 minutes, I doubt it and it's not enough time","I had no idea that this would only operate for 2 minutes. I haven't timed it and I think it's less than 2 minutes and then it won't give another 2 minutes. Who in the world thought this was a good idea? So, I've spent good money for an electric tooth brush that I leave to charge between brushings but can only use for seconds at a time and then have to finish manually. Oh and check out the price on the replacement brushes before you buy, they are not cheap! Really regret this purchase!"
1,DEAD!!! Don't buy,"I bought this in June 2010 and it now won't hold a charge. After doing some research, it seems this happened many times before. It might be the batteries but you can't repair it because there are no screws to open the unit. Bad design! I bought a electric toothbrush from Oral B for less than $15 that lasted a hell of a lot longer. My advice is don't buy this product!!!"
3,Less than what I expected,"This is my first electronic toothbrush. At first, I didn't know how to use it and I was burshing it like the regulary toothbrush and I was so tired of holding it because it's a heavy and big comparing to the regular toothbursh. Then after using it for a week or so, I started to know how to use it and don't really pay much attention to the weight now. Maybe because I use it in the right way. I pressed the toothbrush against my teeth and bring it back and forth(instead of brushing like the regular toothbrush)I separted my teeth into four area and I would bursh a little longer for the parts that need more cleaning.The batteries are pretty good, one full charged can be use almost a week or maybe a little more. I still think it's a little heavy but worth of trying."
1,Information posted wrong,Yhe product was and still is great. Works well and does the job. But AMAZON this one time of all the times I purchased products made a mistake that cost me about $50.00. They said the products was a rebate item but gave me the wrong printed rebate form and so I lost the rebate I expected to get on the sale. So it made the sale a bust. I was then and am now not happy about that senario.
5,LOVE THIS!,This is THE toothbrush to get....LOVE IT!!! I tried the Essence 5300 and returned it...it was a piece of junk. Battery stopped working completely after a day. THIS ONE IS THE BOMB!!! Look no further!!!!!
2,TOOTHBRUSH OR TOOL TO CONTROL OUR MINDS???,"I RECEIVED THIS ""TOOTHBRUSH"" AS A GIFT FOR THE HOLIDAY KNOWN BY SOME AS CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR OR SHOULD I SAY LAST YEAR, AS IT WAS ACTUALLY IN 2010. SO IVE BEEN USING THIS ""TOOTHBRUSH"" FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS NOW. FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A NONSTOP HEADACHE AND VIBRATING SENSATION IN MY INNER-EAR AND BRAIN THAT HAS NOT GONE AWAY AND I CANNOT GET ANY RELIEF FROM THIS. I STOPPED USING THE TOOTHBRUSH THIS MORNING AND SO FAR IT HASNT GOTTEN ANY WORSE, BUT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THE PAIN IS CAUSED BY THE TOOTHBRUSH. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THIS ""TOOTHBRUSH"" IS ACTUALLY A TOOL USED BY THE FAT CATS AT SONICARE TO TRY TO GAIN CONTROL OVER MY MIND AND INNERMOST THOUGHTS. GUESS WHAT, SONICARE, I AM ONTO THIS SCHEME AND IM DONE! IM NOT GOING TO USE THIS TOOTHBRUSH ANYMORE AND GO BACK TO MY $4.99 CREST BRUSH (W/ TONGUE CLEANER). JUST A HEADS UP!!!!!!!"
2,defective yahtzee cd,I received the cd and tried to upload it into my Dell computer. I had all the specs that it asked for but could not upload or use it right from the drive. It is in the mail right now to be returned. I have always had very good luck with Amazon and will still be using Amazon.com as a website.
5,wov my teeth are sparkling,"I used to be a lazy bum when it comes to brushing, but this one changed my habit. I no longer feel the strange sense of tooth paste still in my mouth, it completely uses and washes away all that detergent in the tooth paste. This one is cheap ( no 30 second timers) but I dont feel any need for them, I have become used to brush all quadrants of mouth in the 2 minutes. It was very easy to start on, very convenient, keeps the charge for days, very easy to clean. This is just a wonderful product for a great price, everyone should get one each for all in family."
1,Needs to be Drained every few days,"I was very impressed with the 4000 series and thought this product would be the same level of quality. The handle is fine but the brush attachment is a different type and uses a flawed design that should be recalled. The brush installation is clumsy at best and feels like those $6 battery powered ones. The worst part is that in use, your tooth paste, water, and saliva drips down in to gaps and a chamber inside the head. It then dribbles out these little holes in the side and down your sleeve, on your shirt in the morning, and has to be taken apart and cleaned every few days."
2,Nasty and Unhealthy Design,"I've had my Sonicare for several years, replacing heads as needed. The last head I purchased had evidently been redesigned as water, saliva, toothpaste, etc., wind up inside the toothbrush. I wasn't expecting this, just regularly unscrewed the two pieces and wiped off as I did with the previous head - not knowing that there was a large amount of mold growing underneath the brush itself. I called Sonicare and a representative told me that I could remove the brush and clean there which I did. Not good enough. At least once a day, the whole thing has to be disassembled, cleaned, and dried - a process that takes longer than brushing my teeth - as the mold grows where you can't see or reach. If you're not aware of this flaw, please run a q-tip up inside the brush part - you might be amazed and disgusted."
1,Unsanitary design - mold & filth in your mouth,"Mold, scum, bacteria, germs, and other filth accumulates in the deep crevices of the handle and toothbrushes in this unsanitary design. It is impossible to scrub off the unsanitary accumulations as these are in deep unaccessible out of sight crevices. Each time you brush your teeth you put this filthy unhealthy cr*p in your mouth."
4,"Swear buy Sonicare, this is my 2nd!","I had to buy this toothbrush due to my original Sonicare finally biting the dust. I had it for many years and was well worth it's hefty price I paid for it. Since my original, there have been many new models out and I opted for this one b/c of the better price than a few others.Pros: More universal head that is more flexible than the originals. Easier to purchase new heads. Now the heads come with the indicator in the bristles to let you know when to replace compared to the old ones that you used to replace every 6mths. My dentist is always very impressed with the condition of my teeth :).Cons: On this model only, for some reason it doesn't have the beep at every 30sec interval during your 2 minute brushing time.If you are thinking of buying a Sonicare for the 1st time, BUY IT! They are great at cleaning areas that a normal toothbrush can't. I could not see myself going back to manual."
4,General Review,"My basic sonicare brush also lasted about 15 years or more. It just stopped holding a charge (not sure if it's related to me sticking an ""elite"" brush head on it). Even though it's probably true ""they don't make 'em like they used too,"" Sonicare has one more loyal customer right here. I'll write back to report when my new ""essence"" craps out :)"
1,Quit working after 2 months,"Need I say more than it quit holding a charge in less than 2 months? After 30 days, you have to contact Phillips directly for service or exchange. We'll see how that goes, but for now my teeth aren't as clean, I'm sure. Yuck."
1,This model dosen't last long!,"I had a Sonicare Elite years ago. It lasted 5+ years. I replaced it with this model 1 year ago this month. This model is now dead. It never held a charge for more than a few days and now it won't hold a charge for more than 30 seconds. The Elite model held a charge for weeks! The Sonicare is a great toothbrush, but this cheap model dosen't last long."
4,Phillips Sonicare is Tops,I am a heatlth care professional. I know the importance of good teeth and especially the importance of good gums. The Phillips Sonicare has several excellent things going for it.1. It stays on for two minutes. Very few people who brush by hand do so for more than 30 seconds. It takes two minutes to loosen all the plaque and to get the gums clean.2. It takes the brushing out of brushing. It makes it easy because all the user has to do is guide the brush so it gets to every place.3. Ir brushes at a rate that is gently; yet foirm on the teeth and gum tissue.I am a convinced user.Jim Scala
3,Too Many Choices,"I bought a Sonicare back in the late 90s or early 2000s and loved it. It lasted me for over 10 years (with plenty of head changes) and was a great toothbrush. When I bought it, essentially, there was one choice for Sonicare.Now there's a hundred choices. I bought this one because it looks, essentially, just like the one I had and was fine with.Unfortunately, this one doesn't have the ""quadpacer"" on it, which is nothing more than a 30-second timer to let you know when to change mouth quadrants.After buying it (and using it), I saw the grid on the webpage that told me that. My own fault for not doing more research on it; but, really, is there a need for this many options? It's a toothbrush, after all."
2,Unpleasant brushing,"Purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband. He has used it only a few times, and it will probably be sent back for the money-back guarantee. He finds the brushing too harsh and painful for his teeth."
3,Not as good as the cheaper model it replaced: typical.,"I was trying to replace the Sonicare Advance toothbrush that I fried by plugging it into 220V power in the Philippines. That model is no longer available, nor is the charger available separately, which was the part that got fried. So I got the Essence toothbrush. The old, cheaper Advance that I had, pauses every half-minute to let you know that quadrant of your mouth is done, and to devote equal attention to all areas. The Essence doesn't do that, so it has fewer features than the obsolete one. There was a time when products would be improved over time rather than made more cheaply and sold for more money. I guess those days are over now that corporations are allowed to buy politicians. We are here for the benefit of corporations, and we'll take what they give us. I am using the old Advance handle with the new charger that cost me 50 bucks."
4,IT BRUSHES YOUR TEETH PROPERLY,"What can you say about a toothbrush? This was recommended by my dentist and I'm glad I followed his advise and bought the sonicare instead of one of the other brands. It doesn't stop the minute it hits your teeth as some do according to him. It brushes your teeth correctly. That was the important thing. I bought the ""plain Jane"" model and feel there was no reason to buy the one with all the bells and whistles."
3,Electric toothbrush by Sonicare,This specific one was recommended by my dentist. It does a good job of cleaning although it takes some getting used to once the easy motion preliminary setting is over. The instruction booklet could use some improvement as it is not obvious how to clean it or how to replace the brush head.
2,Sonicare toothbrush,"Not what I thought I was buying,does not make a noise every 30 seconds like mine to change the brushing area."
2,Disappointed in the packaging,"I received this excellent toothbrush from Amazon today - while I love the toothbrush, I was planning on giving this as a gift, but it arrived as it was shipped from Phillips to Amazon: not in a regular retail box like the product comes packaged in the store, but in a brown commercial box with address labels all over it. I really can't give it as a gift this way, or if I do, I'll have to think of some clever way to hide all the shipping labels on the box. Disappointing!"
4,Sonicare Essence,This is a replacement system. I had an original for 7 years. The Essence feels the same as the old one. The brush head is smaller than the original. I am disappointed it doesn't time for 30 second intervals like my old one.
5,Outstanding Product,SonicCare...it is the Cadi of toothbrushes! Best oral care product I have ever tried. You can literally feel the difference every time you use it.
3,"Maybe I got a ""Friday afternoon"" product","I bought this to replace a fairly old e-Series Sonicare that had given me good service, but only lasted a day or two between charges.The price was good, so I didn't worry too much about losing the half-minute bleeps that made it so easy to brush evenly with the old unit.My hope was that the switch from NiCd to Nickel Metal Hydride would give improved stamina per charge. However the opposite has proved to be the case. On one occasion, this unit failed to complete a brushing immediately after being removed from the charger (though it's usually rather better than that).My guess is that I've just been unlucky, and most examples of this product are fine. But if the problems continue, I'll be returning this one as soon as I return to the USA. In the meantime, I've returned to the old one."
5,best thing happened to my teeth,"You ever had a moment that you thought to yourself: I am so bored...oh I am going to brush my teeth!For all those tricks and threats my mom gave me when I was little, for all those guilt I felt when I skipped brushing teeth at night, for all those serious looks on the dentists' faces when they were telling me the conditions of my teeth...Sonicare glances at them and smiles..."
3,Good for home use but not for travel outside the USA,"I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for nearly 10 years and overall they are great for keeping the gums healthy and work much better than a manual toothbrush.The chargers only work reliably with 110v AC current as found in the USA. In countries with 220/230v wall current the charger will usually not work with a current adapter and can even be burned out. Unfortunately you need to buy a Sonicare overseas to get the 230v charger.It will work for two weeks for one user without needing to be recharged but for a couple traveling that means two complete Sonicare units need to be taken, or the Sonicare will last only one week.I have switched to a toothbrush using replaceable AA batteries for use when traveling overseas.Philips Sonicare HX3351/02 Xtreme Battery Operated Toothbrush"
3,Died after two months,"I bought this back in December and by mid-February the battery in the base wouldn't take/hold a charge anymore.I called Phillips' service number and they had a new base unit sent out to me at no cost and included a pre-paid return label for me to ship the defective base unit back to them. So far, the new unit is working fine but only time will tell if it holds up better than the first one."
4,Philips Sonicare HX,"Product works well. Cleaning weekly is a hassle. The junk that gets in the creases is gross. Otherwise I""m pleased."
5,Your teeth will love you!,"So the hardest thing about brushing is having to do it for the dentist recommended time.The great thing about this brush is that you dont have to time yourself, once you turn it onit'll automatically turn itself off after the duration recommended. It works great and definitelyleaves you feeling fresh in the mouth!"
3,Always a great toothbrush,"It was shipped quickly and came as advertized. The only drawback was the fact that it does not have the timer function that of-the-shelf or more expensive models have. Still, I have a sense of the time and one can always start the toothbrush again.."
4,Don't use plastic head to brush,My Hygienist and Dentist will be the real arbitrars. Hope I am not damaging my teeth with the-too often-contact of the vibrating brush head against my toothes (sic? but I like).
2,My battery will no longer charge,"Boooooo! After 6 months my battery no longer charges. I called Sonicare and did a ""reset"" on the product without luck. I must have been stuck with a bad one."
3,Sonicare 5300,"It looked the same as my Sonicare, but it was different enough to cause a problem. The shape is now different. It is no longer round, it is oval. The charger is just different enough that it cannot be shared. So now when we go on a trip, we still have to take two chargers. Other than that, it works the same. Still no option for replacing batteries."
4,Functions well.,"This is my third Sonicare, if I recall correctly. I would have preferred the one with the ""Quadrapacer"" feature, but it just seems to me as if they are getting more expensive each time I buy one. Economics being as they are, I had to go cheap this time. I'd suggest that, for the money one pays for the device, they should be guaranteed forever. Other than the expense vs. longevity, the Sonicare is a wonderful product, convenient to use, and does a great job. In fact, I believe I've had more dentists than I've had Sonicare toothbrushes. The latest dentist seems like a keeper; his office sells replacement Sonicare heads pretty cheap."
4,Works great!,This Sonicare brush was delivered quickly and works great in cleaning my teeth. I would highly recommend this brush. It was priced lower on Amazon than other places I checked.
5,A great feel at a good price,I've been using a sonicare toothbrush for over ten years and I truely believe I wouldn't have all of my teeth if I hadn't. And I love the feel of clean teeth and gums. The brush I purchased from Amazon was everything I hoped for at a good price. I bought one for my daughter too. Thank you Amazon.
4,Good inexpensive brush,"I purchased this toothbrush to replace a more expensive Sonicare brush that had quit working. It works well for the price. It is noisier and more rattle-y than my previous brush, and I kind of miss the 30 second timer beep from the more more expensive brush. But this brush was so much more affordable."
5,SONICARE ESSENCE,"This is my second Sonicare Essence. The first one lasted about 3 years. I really like how clean it makes my teeth. I am a coffee drinker, which stains my teeth. I have noticed much whiter teeth after using this brush. In fact, my wife compliments me on how white my teeth have become. The brush has a 2 minute timer. I will let it cycle 2-3 times (4-6 minutes) on my front teeth to get whiter teeth. I don't do this every time I brush, just once a week is enough.The replacement brush heads are a little pricey. The manufacturer recommends replacement after 3 months. I usually wait a lot longer to replace them without have any problems."
2,Surprise when I first used the Sonicare 5300 Toothbrush,It was a disappointment when I first used my new Sonicare 5300 toothbrush. It does not have the 30 second reminders like my former toothbrush had. It is usable - and certainly I would not return it after I had used it. I wish Amazon would that information available to all prospective customers.
4,awesome...,I love philips essence 5300 power toothbrush. This is one of the best products i bought online...
2,Missing items,I would give more stars seeing that I'm a repeat customer but the brush head was missing and since I purchased before Thanksgiving for XMAS it was past the seller feedback period. That's a raw deal!I have extra heads so it's not a show stopper. The Sonicare is a fantastic brush with superior cleaning and recommend it highly. Just be careful not to go beyond 30 days prior to opening it or you luck out if anything is wrong with your order.Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush
2,Disgusting design,"I regret not listening to other buyers' comments. I went for this cheaper model and it is disgusting because of the screw-on design. Then I had to spend $17 more for a rubber cover to fix this problem. Do yourself a favor, pay a bit more and get the flex-care design instead."
4,Like this enough to buy a replacement after I dropped ours,"We really like this model of Sonic are Toothbrush. It does its job very well, and for the price, you can't go wrong. Our previous one was the same model, which I dropped. After using electrical tape to hold it together for over a year, it wasn't charging well. So I found this one, and the price was much lower than our first one.There are some bad reviews concerning mold. We always wipe ours off when done using it for the day, and have never had mold develop. I suppose if you let water pool in the top of the base that could happen, but why would you do that? It only takes a couple of seconds to wipe it off. We replace the brushes every 4-6 months as well and have never had mold grow on them. We do let them sit out to air dry and wipe off their bases.Our dentist could tell when we started using this product. We'll never use a regular toothbrush again."
1,Great for the first two weeks...,"Excited to get this toothbrush at such a good price. It worked really well the first couple of weeks (it remained on the charger per instructions when not in use). Took it on a several-day trip with me, sans charger, as manual indicates it holds about a two week charge for normal use. Used twice on the trip and then, went to use it a third time... zip, zilch, nada. Completely dead. Put it on charger when I got home. Still no signs of life. Fini. When I first received this unit, I noticed there didn't seem to be any waterproofing where the brush head meets the handle, so perhaps it is a design flaw or simply bum luck.I've switched to zee German-madeOral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count. MUCH more money, but great reviews. And hey, Germans know how to make durable, lasting stuff."
4,Phillips Sonicare HX5351 rechargeable toothbrush,This is a great tool for helping keep your teeth clean if used properly. Follow the instructions closely and you will get the best results.
2,Violent and loud,"The toothbrush does leave your teeth feeling very clean after use. But it is SO loud and violent.I only use it for a week and it hurt my gums in one area and I have to avoid brushing there.I keep going back to the starters mode to have it more bearable.I am trying to understand if I got a defective unit, or if this toothbrush is just too much for my gums. I was using ORAL-B Sonicare for 3 years without any issues.Would be interested to hear from other customers about their experience. At this point I'm afraid that it might be just too rough and maybe dangerous too keep using it."
5,loves sonicare,"My Sonicare arrived in good condition and I couldn't wait for the batteries to charge up. It didn't disapoint me the next day. It's vibrations throughoout my mouth made my gums feel energized and teeth clean. Recomended by my dentist, my decay level has dropped to zero, thanks to Sonicare."
5,use it every day,"like brushing your teeth with a mosquito!i have had 2 of these and just got my wife one also. my only complaint is that water, goo and mold gets into the space between the head and the handle. if you clean it regularly its not a problem.LOVE MINE!"
5,Great brush feels like a pro clean,"This isn't a regular electric tooth brush. It feels at little intense at first but you get used to it. It holds a charge for a while so if you have a smaller bath vanity, you don't have to have the charger out all the time to take up space. I haven't charged it in about a week and a half."
5,Great toothbrush for the Money,"Not all of the bells and whistles of the higher priced models, but a great toothbrush. My old ""Advanced"" model lasted about 9 years. Hope this one will do the same. Bottom line, no need to spend the extra money on the new Flexcare models when the Essence will do very nicely."
4,Goodbye Periodontal Pockets and Gum Disease!,"This is a wonderful toothbrush. My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this as compared to a manual toothbrush. It's very easy to use. I will admit that the sonic action takes a little getting used to...it tickled my lips the first few times :-) I don't really have any complaints other than it does get a little grimey, so make sure you clean it once a week as instructed. Other than that, I would certainly recommend it to anyone who has periodontal disease. The true test of its worth will obviously be after my f/u dentist appt in April...until then, I have no complaints."
1,Dont bother,"This purchase was a replacement of a prior purchase of this Philps Sonicare toothbrush. These are not cheap and my first one lasted about 13 months. I called the company directly and they refused to replace or repair their product. I purchased another because we bought a set of these and all the attachment/brushes and charger bases. The brush does do a good job but wears out quckly and the company must be aware of this since they have a flat-out ""no"" on repair/reurn requests.In the future I will not buy any Philips products."
3,Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush,It works great. I feel my teeth cleaner. I would recommend it to anybody. Great gift for someone. This makes a gift for christmas present. I wish it would come in different color.
2,Battery did not hold,Sonicare brushes are great but this one the battery died after only one day of not being on the charger. We got a replacement and it seems to be working better.
2,"Brushes okay, but...","This toothbrush does an okay job with teeth and gum brushing but it is DIRTY! I take the top off after my twice a day use and rinse it out in hot water. I replace the two parts in their proper places each time. Weekly, I separate the parts of the brush head to clean it and inside is the slimiest black stuff...stuff I have seen inside a sink drain. I had to use another toothbrush and a q-tip to clean it. I would never recommend this brush nor would I buy it again. I am going to try to spray the insides with a weak bleach solution to see if it cuts down on the black slime. ICK!"
1,"stated ""new""--arrive ""not new""","the Amazon site stated the Sonicare was ""new"" but when it arrived, it was not or in any factory packing. The Sonicare and components were simply placed loosely in the packing cardboard box. This was not sanitary! Not the usual quality for Amazon."
5,I love my sonicare!,The Philips Sonicare is the best money that I have ever spent on a toothbrush. My teeth feel are more smooth than they have ever been. I plan on purchasing everyone in my family one. Great product!
5,great toothbrush,"This powered toothbrush is outstanding.It does a great job cleaning your teeth and also gently brushes your gums,and the price from Amazon with free shipping was a bargain."
2,RATHER USE A TOOTHBRUSH,MY TEETH DON'T FEEL CLEAN AND IT IRRITATES MY GUMS. THE ITEM IS REALLY TOO LONG TO EFFECTIVELY GET TO ALL AREAS THAT YOU SHOULD BE CLEANING. DON'T USE VERY MUCH.
5,I love the sonicare toothbrush,This is the best electric toothbrush I've ever owned. It actually removes stains from teeth. I had stains from smoking that have been brushed away by my sonicare. It's great for scrubbing my tongue too. The heads for the Sonicare last a few months and they aren't too pricey.
5,Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush,My family and I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for years. Are teeth and gums are great and we always get wonderful comments from our dentists. You won't be disappointed.
5,Bargain,Works fine.. why would anybody buy the more expensive Sonicare models which cost twice as much?
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed, since I thought my other brushhead which I have bought in stock can be used, but its does not."
3,"Teeth Never Felt Cleaner, Yet Can't Hold a Charge","I purchased this model as I blew out my original Sonicare's charger while visiting Buenos Aires, Argentina. (Like the instructions say, DON'T PLUG THE SONICARE INTO FOREIGN SOCKETS, EVEN WITH A CONVERTER... it will fry it. I had to learn the hard way)I was literally tickled when this came in the mail and absolutely love it. The one bummer is I believe my toothbrush is defective as it can't hold a charge and must be placed on it's charging pedestal every single night without fail.I hope it's juts my particular brush and not the whole 5300 series that's buggy.In terms of the benefits, the pockets in my gums have slowly begun to close and this is a direct result of using Sonicare toothbrushes... I can NEVER go back to normal brushing. :)"
2,LEAKS INSIDE UNIT,Purchased a Philips Sonicare toothbrush and each timeI use it I have to take it apart to clean it becausewhere the unit screws together has no seal and alwaysleaks. Therefore the inside of the unit becomes filthy.By the time my wife discovered hers it had mold in it.
4,Teeth Police,"All in all I really like this product and teeth have never felt cleaner. I would change the design so that the handle doesn't get so messy and need cleaning so often. The brush seems to be wearing very quickly, and I feel that a replacement BRUSH as opposed to the whole top of the toothbrush would have been a better design. Replacements are VERY expensive and tend to make me keep the brushes a little longer than I should."
5,very happy,"i'm very happy with my sonicare toothbrush - i only wish i would have gotten one sooner! the price here on amazon was better than anywhere else, online or retail store that i could find."
4,Nice product,"I've had other electric toothbrushes before, but I must admit that this product does a much better job that others I have owned. When done, your teeth feel amazingly smooth, jast as if you had just been to a dentist."
2,Performs as Advertised but with Critical Product Flaw,"I love the brush action of this product. Works great. Recommended to me when I wore braces, and it was the easiest way to keep my teeth clean with all of the equipment.WARNING. You have to constantly clean under the brush head. The replaceable heads do not seal to the battery unit. You have to remove and rinse the inside of the unit weekly to prevent mold. If mold does develop, you might as well give up an buy a new unit. Not what you want from an expensive toothbrush.I have kept replacing the brush, but it is frustrating."
