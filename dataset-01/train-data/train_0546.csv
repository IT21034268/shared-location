5,great family favorite,"every year had to wait to see this film during halloween, finally bought it. kids and I really enjoy it."
5,Review of Casper Movie,I was very satisfied with both the condition and the timing in which I received the Casper Special Education DVD. No complaints here!
5,Highly Recommended,"Received DVD with great speed, new as advertised and all for a great price. Thank You!"
4,Great family film . . . but what a waste of Eric Idle!,"First off, I want to say that this is an outstanding family film. Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci make an impressive duo as father and daughter, while the effects are especially realistic and outstanding. But . . . couldn't they have given Eric Idle a better purpose for this film? I mean, he's from MONTY PYTHON! At least give him some catchy wordplay! Here, in this movie, he isn't given much, but he should have been given a whole lot. He could have had a hysterical conversation with the ghostly trio or something like that. But anyway, this really is a good film, especially if you want to see the original animated Casper the Friendly Ghost turn into a full CGI character."
5,''Can i keep you'',The movie is really good and funny bill pullman is so great in the movie.Me and my friend pauline think casper looks so good alive as devon sawa.
5,Watched this over and over...,Casper is so endearing and we have watched it repeatedly with our older grandchildren. We had it on vhs so we def needed an updated version... and we now have another set of younger grandchilden that haven't seen it. Was happy to get it on dvd... much better quality!! If you haven't seen it yet... you're in for a treat.
5,Great halloween Movie!,"Casper has always been a favorite of mine since my kids were little! If you don't have this in your Halloween collection you must get. Great movie, great price, received in no time at all. Would recommend movie and seller to anyone.Thanks"
4,Favorite,"Of all the Casper movies, this one is definitely my favorite. Live action was the next step for Casper, and they definitely nailed it. The story is not only cute, but moving. I love it!"
3,I ain't scared of no ghost,"Abnormal psychologist and his daugter are tasked to rid an old mansion of three crude ghosts by a materialistic, greedy business woman and her idiotic companion. Funny and impressive comedy with a few recognizable faces (the one you really have to catch is Wesson from HOME IMPROVEMENT) and cameos from some famous faces. The best has to be Aykroyd from GHOSTBUSTERS carrying his proton pack with him. The ghostly trio are also funny and no death joke is ignored. Might possibly be past children."
1,Family Friendly... Not for the younger ones,"Within the first 5 mins. you hear ""h*ll"" and ""d@mn"" from one of the characters. Not a problem unless you were hoping to show this to a 5yr old. To be fair, it is a PG film but the it would have played just fine without the language. If families were Spielberg's target audience (who else would watch this), he had to know that the language would keep younger viewers out and that older teens might not be interested in Casper. It was just strange language to hear in a film strongly promoted as ""family."" If you read the other reviews, you will see others noting this.Got to go now to watch Bambi's mother get wacked in a G-rated film (got to love the rating system). :-)"
1,SOOO not family friendly!!!!!,"How can ANYBODY call this a family film??? Language (bi***), father in a drunken stupor, attempted murder, and an overall poor story. Thank the gods I checked this out at the library and didnt pay money for this thing. Definitely not for my family, anyway. Read a good book together."
3,Just about Eric Idle stinking bad in this film,Without his fellow Monty Python gang members Eric Idle is just horrible in every way to watch. Here in this film watch his no chemistry-whatsoever performance with Cathy Moriarty. Their characters are supposed to know each other. You'll swear the two actors only met real life like 5 seconds before the camera began rolling and they just might have. Idle acts like he's in a different film entirely than Moriarty. He's unfunny to boot to watch and he's just weird here. I think the people who made Python knew how to film him at his best. He needs a certain director and writer or just forget it and him. Entirely!
2,Vaccuum Scene,"I can't believe Fatso gets sucked up in the vaccuum. I mean, come on, Fatso is probably the fattest thing I've ever seen, so how could he fit inside it? And also, what the devil did Fatso do to deserve it? All Fatso did was jab at Dr. Harvey with his weapon, but missed, and tickle him. That's all he did. And Stretch and Stinky harm Dr. Harvey. Stretch cuts off Dr. Harvey's trousers, and Stinky makes the place stink. Poor Fatso, he gets sucked up in the vaccuum all for nothing. He should get free pizzas and fast food 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I love Fatso He is a major inspiration to me. I'mgoing to avenge him by being just like him."
4,What a tragic waste. She had my favourite sunglasses.,"I have just seen this movie. The last time I saw it was when I was 13 years old (this was a long time ago). I bought it out of a DVD bin for [...] dollars and decided to watch it again.I wasn't disappointed. I loved Cathy Moriarty as Carrigan, and Eric Idle as Dibs. I thought that they were very funny as a duo.I felt sorry for Casper when he lost his chance to live permanently as a human, but I understood why he did it. Overall, there are a lot of emotional moments and laughs in the film.If people are wondering what the rating on the movie is about - there are a few swears, and a few characters die and are re-animated, but that's about it.I would recommend watching it."
5,A great movie for kids and adults,"This is one of those uncommon movies -- like Toy Story -- that adults can really enjoy as well as their kids. There are enough subtexts and adult moments to make it more than ""just a kid's movie."" Kat's father, dealing with the loss of a spouse and also trying to raise a daughter on his own is a good example. I thought the special effects were pretty seamless, although I've never seen it on anything larger than a 27"" TV. :) Definitely a highly-recommended movie."
2,Movie does not do justice to cartoons,"I only bought this movie because I had discovered Clint Eastwood was in it. I collect all movies that he is in. He just has a cameo in one scene and a few lines. The story in this movie is not for kids and does not make much sense. It is nothing like the Casper cartoons that I watched as a kid that I enjoyed. It has a good cast but their talents are wasted on an awful script. It goes to show you if Steven Spielberg is involved and you spend 50 million dollars on a movie people will come and see it whether it is good or not. Eric Idle of Monty Phython is in it who is normally very funny. They do not use his talents to their advantage in the movie. He doesn't get much in the way of funny scenes. Casper is portrayed pretty well, but he is put in situations that he would have never been in in any of the cartoons. The father's death in the movie is made light of even though he is brought back to life later. This would not be good for little kids."
4,"Great Movie, Poor DVD.","This is an excellent movie. I am assuming you have seen it so I won't bore you with a review of the movie itself, wich I give 5 stars. But this DVD release is by no means a ""special edition"", a term that is used loosely today to sell more DVD's. That is why I deducted a star. There is a half hour making of wich is interesting, but I wish they would have done more. There is only one deleted scene, and although it is unique and interesting due to the fact that the ghosts were never digitally added, they could have shown more. Then there are little kids games and a classic Casper cartoon. They could have put more of the cartoons on. As far as the actual movie goes, the picture is crisp and the 5.1 mix is decent. I bet next year we will all be fooled when Universal re-releases it for it's 10th anniversary with the real special edition."
3,Shhheeeessh,"Check out all these ""Reviewers"" knocking this little gem. It's meant for pre-adolescents for goodness sake! It's a big hit at my place."
4,Casper my only gripe is its not available on blu ray,"Awesome movie just wish it was on blu ray, Im sure one day it will but until then i am ok with at least having it in my dvd collection"
5,GReat Halloween movie,I have had a hard time finding movies for halloween that are not over the edge for the kids.This movie has always been a classic.
4,great wooden chess board for the price,"I like the wooden case which keeps the chess pieces, so no fear of loosing them. overall good quality wooden construction, arrived on time, on the chess pieces are plastic but have the wooden finish, but cant ask for more for the price"
2,Poor Quality,"There is nothing to say about the game, it is chess. But i am very disappointed for the the quality of the product. The light weight pieces are cheap plastic feel and they are small so it does not look balance on the big board."
5,Tiger Flower,"Tender, lyrical and inspired tale featuring a tiger, transformed by a magical wind to a much smaller and more peaceful version of himself. Told in the first person, Tiger Flower uses free verse and brilliant, psychedelic illustrations to describe the joys of being a tiny tiger who hunts flowers, instead of a fierce king of the jungle, always under pressure to fight. He lists all the sensual pleasures and spacious delights that come to those who leave the jungle for a world where everyone does exactly as he likes and is always himself. The poetry is naive and the paintings are lush and stunning."
4,A fine read,"I read this as an adult, remembering how much I enjoyed the Tripod Trilogy as a teen. This was a fun read with plausible history woven through out the story. One of the sequels is ""The New Found Land,"" which I remember to be good."
3,Wwwwaaaaaaaaa there's not enough music,"I'm irate. This disk doesn't have enough music on it. How dare someone market a disk that doesn't take up the full capacity of the medium! Especially as part of a group set of classic artists and most of the others have about 10-12 songs per as well. How dare they? I've almost a mind not to buy it. That'll teach'em.But at least now there's a forum for people with hair trigger tempers, a gross sense of entitlement, and diahorrea fingers such as myself to unload himself, and thereby cleanse their soul, from this crass, corporate, greedy attack on my psyche. People better start doing things my way or else. Has anybody written their Congressman? All this Government Force lying around and someone gets away with putting out a CD with 31 minutes on it? The Feds better get their priorities straight.The music is pretty good too, but Cousin Marvin was better...."
1,No Particular Disc To Buy,A Chuck Berry collection with only 11 songs on it!?! There are some with as many as 28. Buy those instead.
1,Chuck Abridged,Too few Chuck Berry songs on this CD. Better to get His Best Vol 1 & 2 or Great 28. This series is not useful or economical.
2,Poor introduction to the genius of Berry,"The music is certainly great, not to mention groundbreaking, making Berry an essential entry in any music collection. However, there are so many other compilation albums to get before this one. The problem with skimpy single-artist compilations like these is, while they do serve a proper introduction, that after you begin liking the artist you have absolutely no use for the compilation. Almost every song here can be found on both ""The Great Twenty-Eight"" and the Chess ""Anthology"" release, two superior (and superiorly compiled) introductions to Berry's work. The songs on here are great (with the exception of ""My Ding-A-Ling""), but honestly - way too brief. There is about twenty-five minutes worth of material, and a CD can hold up to eighty. A used copy of ""The Great Twenty-Eight"" probably costs less, get that instead."
5,I use this for my Fig Trees,Works with my large planters that I roll in to the garage each winter with my fig trees. They are heavy and I have a bad back so this is wonderful.
2,Not sturdy enough,"A pot with a 16 inch base, filled with soil and plants, weighs a considerable amount. The first time we put a large pot on this caddy and rolled it across the floor, the base broke and a wheel fell off when it went over the edge of a carpet. Ace Hardware was quick to replace it, but the truth is that you have to be very careful to only roll it over smooth surfaces."
3,"utilitarian design, good buy","Nicely made but don't overload it, and drill a hole in the bottom for water to drain out. The size of the pot needs to be 16"" or less."
3,I've had better from this Cook,"Cook's Black Company series is without question the strongest of his writing, but Swordbearer is a good quick read if you are tired of reading through all the old familiar stuff in your collection.The plot is indeed recycled, but the characters are very much fresh. How many fantasy novels can you think of that feature a crippled hero?"
2,Swordbearer,"A magical soul-eating sword chooses a young cripple as its bearer.Proof positive that even for the really good writers of the world, there's a learning curve.Underwritten, ""telly"", cliched, disjointed to the point of incoherence. I'm convinced this would not be publishable today. When it first came out in 1982, perhaps its straightforward prose and grey morality seemed new -- but now readers can find Cook's style expressed on a much higher plane in his Black Company books."
1,Learning Curve Indeed,"I concur with the comments from another reviewer:Underwritten, ""telly"" ... disjointed to the point of incoherence. I'm convinced this would not be publishable today.As I was reading, I thought exactly those same things. After reading this, I moved on to The Tower of Fear (since I had bought up a bunch of Cook's stuff before reading any of it), and that was a _lot_ better. Even diehard Cook fans should probably skip this early (pre-Black Company) effort."
3,not really jewish cooking,"the book was nice we personally knew the author, he was a very nice man and he should rest in peacehad some authentic recipes but, Jews from these regions of the world are very strict when it comes to the rules of kashrut(kosher) mr. marks had more than a few recipes in this book that if he did his research he would have never put them in The one basic rule for jewish cuisine is NEVER to MIX meat and dairy in one dish or even in a meal there are even rules about how long you must wait before you eat a meat meal after eating dairy and visa versa"
5,Multipurpose ties,"I had ""won"" a similar product at a family reunion and used it for many things. Most recently, I used it to tie my grape vines to supporting stakes. When I ran out, I couldn't find them locally and was so happy to find them available through Amazon.The wire tie makes these strong and the plastic coating makes them good for indoor or outdoor use. So much better than reusing the paper covered ties that come on grocery store products. Highly recommended."
3,Needs mechanical improvement,"Appearance of this machine is very good and well made. Also, it is very quite. However, what I don't like about this machine is, it has manual switches to select direction of rotation either clockwise or counter-clockwise. If I don't pick right direction of rotation it does not wind my watch. I got this machine a month ago and I still don't know which direction I should rotate for each my watch. It would be better if it automatically switches the direction of rotation every so often so I don't have to worry about which direction I should rotate. This is the only reason I put 3 stars rather than 5. Otherwise, it is a very good machine."
5,Hooker's Most Productive Era,"This out-of-print CD represents John Lee Hooker at the peak of his powers. Over the course of three discs you get 56 tracks dating from 1948 to 1952. This collection covers roughly the same period as his classic The Legendary Modern Years 1948-1954 and in fact covers much of the same material--""Sally Mae,"" ""Boogie Chillen,"" ""I'm In the Mood""--though in alternate forms. These tracks were initially available on 1971's Coast to Coast Blues Band (tracks 1-14) and 1973's 3-LP set John Lee Hooker's Detroit (tracks 15-56), both on the United Artists label. Most of these tracks feature Hooker in a solo setting, occasionally overdubbing a second guitar or vocal part. However, he is accompanied by additional musicians on a handful of tracks. If you are an avid fan, these are essential recordings from Hooker's most productive era. Casual fans will be better served by the Modern collection mentioned above or Rhino's excellent 2-disc anthology. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,poor quality material,I bought this item to solve the ever tangling plastic line problem. I had no problem with the design of the product nor fitting it onto my Weedeater model RTE113C. I like the idea but the first time I used this item it broke within the first 5 minutes and a part of it broke off and flew across my yard. If the housing was made of a tougher material possibly metal it would be great.
3,just ok,The one plus is that it quiets you trimmer somehow. But after going through to sets of blades that brake when your edging the lawn I decided to go back to string its cheaper to buy a spool and thread it yourself.
3,Wish I had known...,"This is a two-pack, but only ONE of them fits the B&D; GH600How many people have two weed-eaters of different models?This is potentially wasteful and should at least be addressed in the description[just in case I am not the only one who is uncomfortable only being able to use half of their purchase...]"
1,Wear safety equipment,"I purchased this for a Black & Decker electric trimmer. My yard is small enough that I mow the grass with an electric mower and never have to change the outlet into which I have the mower connected, so there really isn't a lot of area that needs to be trimmed. After one use, the blades were worn down by at least 30%. On the second use, one blade broke off, unbalancing the product and causing it to essentially explode. One blade flew to my left, while the main assembly and the other blade would have flown directly at me, had they not been deflected by the elevated patio under which I was using it.This is a great concept, but horrible, and potentially dangerous, design execution.Although it's a pain, stick with the trimmer line."
5,A beautiful book for anyone who loves aviation history,"I bought this book as a gift for my Dad, a lifelong aviator. The large format pages feature full-color illutrations and comprehensive text. The book covers aircraft dating back to the Wright brothers and forward to the present. Many hours of reading and perusing pleasure are provided by this high-quality book."
5,Hi there,"Its interesting how I found his personal website, and was intrigued by the title of his book. I looked thru his site a few times, and something just led me to go thru with things and purchase his book. Very interesting and I wanted to personally congratulate him for a well written book. Clear thoughts, easy to read and makes you think.Thank you for your contributions and look forward to any future books that you write."
5,Helpful,"Psychic Stephen Piperno comes across as being very helpful and caring. He has some different views when it comes to sex, money and power, but all make total sense and can easily be used to implement your life."
5,You light up my life,"If I could sum this book up, I would say that it lights up my life and gives me concise and clear direction. I had no idea that psychic stephen piperno was a God fearing man as well as spectacular writer. I want to aplaud you on a job well done."
5,Different Kind of Psychic Book,"Masterfully written and detailed. An examination of this book allowed me to see that not all psychics are the same and that many psychics come from various religious backgrounds as psychic stephen is different from any other psychic that I have read about. I was taken aback by his concrete knowledge and thorough understanding of the new age movement and how it's linked to our inner and outward spiritual development. Enjoyable, funny, inspiring and highly psychic."
5,Psychic Know's Best,"I always say that a psychic knows best :). Psychic Stephen really showed his stuff here and I'm proud to own a copy of this book. It's a wonderful book with tremendous insight. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for proper insight on sex,money and power. I'ts a great book to look at from time and time again. There is a lot of good words in this book."
5,Heart Felt,Heart felt book. Piperno really puts his mind and heart into this book. He invites you into his heart and shares with you the lessons from his prophetic mentor and spirit guide. This book truly is life changing. I wish that I could have found this book earlier in my life. I probably would have far less problems now. Magnificant!
5,Powerful,"Spectacular hidden little messages in this book. I loved it. Out of all the books I read this year that had to do with psychic activity, this one certainly tops the list. I am satisfied with my purchase and I look forward to reading more of this book. I still have not finished it, but it's spicey and interesting. Worth Checking out."
2,advertisement for christianity and psychic,"this book seems like an advertisement for psychic and christianity. the author throughout the book isn't being objective enough on the subjects about sex, money, and power and offering solutions. Instead, the author is too busy praising god and offer ""pray, fast, listen, and obey god"" as the only solution.BEWARE, you might be offended by this book if you're not religious.In my opinion, the author ought to search Google for corruptions in american government, u.s. war crimes, and watch Zeitgeist Addendum to see the broader picture.Read ""IF GOD WAS LIKE MAN"" by Barbara Rose instead."
5,"Ok, you got me :)","This book is not what I expected and that's not a bad thing. It's actually a good thing. Books should be spontaneous and mysterious and that's basically what I got out of this book. The author focussed mainly on psychics stuff, sex, money and power. I felt like I was talking with my friend throughout the book. Stephen is more like a life coach and psychic combined. He's good with words. I thought that the book has benefitted my life to some capacity."
5,Smile from Ear to Ear,"As I read this book, I smiled from ear to ear. The interesting points that this book makes out is that no matter how much you have messed up in your life, it's always safe to return to your safety net once again. It helps to rebuild your relationship with God and it gives specific details."
5,Interesting,"Topics that surround our society today...sex, money and power...Mr.Piperno is truly a gifted writer and I found his views very good and its quite an interesting book to read. Very insightful and true to life. Thanks for making my daily commute on the subway an interesting one as I was glued to the pages to your book. Highly recommended!"
5,Masterfully Written,Well written and easy to understand book for sure. Surprising insight into the spirit world and a truly unique book that powerfully touches your life. I thought that this book was simple and easy to read. It has a lot of information in it and is created for the general audience for sure. I loved the chapter about 40 year old women and the things that you stated. It is so true. This book is great for this day in age and it's a lesson that we all need to learn.
2,Fair at best B movie.,This movie was billed as best western since tombstone.IT was a far cry from being anywheres close as good as tombstone. At best it was ok as a B movie. Some of the actors very good. The rest just ok. All in all this was a amaturish low budget movie.
2,Shadowheart,"Well, where do I start with this review? This movie had great scenery, but the acting was bad. It was more a made for T.V. movie. The plot started out great, with a Preacher, and sweet son, and then came the bad guy, who took over the town. By the middle of the movie it became more cheesy than anything good. I would say this would qualify for a Hallmark movie, my husband hated this movie and made rude comments about it being cheesy throughout the whole thing. I thought it was okay, there was no sex, and only one curse word that I could remember, yet there was some violence, not bad considering the normal violent movies. Although James did seek revenge in this movie, it was just deserved. I hated the bad guy too, and I guess that means he played his part well. If you want to view this movie, just rent it, not worth seeing over. This movie was kind of preachy, but that's okay, it's just that this movie was actually really cheesy, but worth at least one viewing."
1,Does for Westerns What Christian Rock Does for Rock,"If you preferred ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" to ""A Fistful of Dollars"", you just might sit through ""Shadowheart"" in its entirety.Otherwise, stilted acting, horrible makeup, an awful, treacly, by-the-numbers plot, and a screenplay which must consist of large quantities of capital letters to drive the morality play home will drive you to push Eject long before the final act.Just. Awful."
2,Refreshingly Moderate Pace,"It seems like most movies are non-stop action or so boring you may fall asleep. Shadowheart falls nicely in the middle ground.Aside from the nice pace of development, Shadowheart lacked any ""sizzle"". The acting was unremarkable. The scenery was unremarkable. The plot was depressing.There really isn't much to say about this movie. The villain is totally disgusting and so you definitely want to see the hero get revenge or justice, but the ending is really nothing more than depressing. Sure it might have been cliche to have a ""successful/cheerful"" ending but it would have been a lot better than how this plot failed.Even though this is probably considered a ""western romance"" it really completely lacked romance. There are a couple of Native Americans that could have been great characters but the opportunity was completely lost."
3,Western falls flat,I like westerns & this one seemed to be good in it's description however I found it to be a slow moving somewhat boring show. Wont be recommending it to any friends as a good movie because it isn't one. A weak love story plus fair acting by a bunch of actors I've never heard of. Could have been better if the writers & director had tried but they didn't so don't waste your time on this one. There are much better westerns out there.
2,Disappointing!,"As a child, Bounty Hunter James Conner saw his father killed, and fled leaving his home and the love of his life. Returning years later after fighting in the Civil War, James is planning to wed his lost love and exact his own brand of justice on the evil land baron, Will Tunney. Returning to Legend, New Mexico and capturing the one who ruined his life doesn't prove as easy as he thought. While I was excited to get a movie thru the Vine Program, I was a little disappointed. ""Shadowheart"" wasn't as good as I had hoped. The cinematography wasn't that exciting, the music wasn't that good and it was kind of low budget. I am not even sure if it was worthy of being shown on the Lifetime channel. However, what merits the ""2"" rating, was the ending. Like traditional westerns, this ending wasn't flowery or pretty, but believable."
2,Pretty Terrible.,"Well I don't want to be mean for the sake of being mean, but this is a terrible movie. It is poorly acted, poorly written, and it's has a few scenes that the direction would make a high school drama club cringe. In addition the movie has vaguely Christian themes, but no substance. The only real enjoyment I got out of this was heckling it with my friends. There is a review on the cover that says it is the best western since ""Tombstone""; That is a bold face lie. In addition it says that it has Daniel Baldwin on the cover. Now I'm not a Baldwin fan but it is always a sign of a bad movie when they list the biggest actor on the cover and he has maybe 5 lines and about 30 seconds on screen."
2,"As the old cliche goes, there's nothing like a good western....","And this was nothing like a good western. There is a scene in the movie where the lead actor says that he has seen things so terrible that a good God couldn't have allowed them, the filming of this movie might have been one of them. Terrible acting combined with a predictable script, and a lousy score all combine to make this a c-grade movie. The one purpose this movie does serve is that for all of you western fans who have heard one to many times that John Wayne can't act, you could now loan this movie to them to prove he could. I will say however, that there is very little violence, no bad language, etc... so you could in theory show this to your children, though why they or you would want to see it is beyond me."
3,Not the best western... but...,"This movie is certainly not be the best western. But, I found that it was highly enjoyable.While formulaic, I loved the scenery and the whole feeling the movie gave.I know some of the music didn't fit, I know it had huge gaping plot holes. The story line wasn't very strong. The acting wasn't very strong.But, for all it's faults, it kept me involved and I was entertained. And, it wasn't as bloody as westerns are known to be, which I also appreciated.So, bottom line... worth watching if it were on the tv, or if you could borrow it from a friend. :)"
1,INEPTLY DIRECTED -- POORLY WRITTEN,"What a disappointment.This movie sets out to tell a story of ""forgiveness and redemption"" (according to the extras). It does neither. How sad to get into a story that's afraid, or does not know how, to resolve what has been set up. I love Westerns but this tedious, overlong, and way too talky dud is firing blanks.This film purports to be about spirituality. In fact, it has the trappings of a ""Christian production."" But sadly, it is without a soul. Or commercial prospects. I'm glad I saw it for free. I wonder, just who is the intended audience? I can't imagine.There's a powerful story in the premise. But I guess no one involved in the production actually experienced forgiveness or redemption. Hollywood can do that to a person. I know."
1,$5 was wayyyyy too much for this film,I'm painfully watching it now. Gotta finish it just bcs I would feel even more raped if I didn't.Horrible horrible horrible.It's just all bad.I will say that we have had a lot of fun ripping on it.That's the only good thing I got out of it.
3,we all drop dead,"In this shallowly plotted movie the good guy's father dies, his brother-in-law dies, his bride dies, the sheriff and his deputies die, the bad guys die, the good guy dies and the indian brother and sister live. The plot seemed to not be sure where it was going so it just circled around killing everyone in its way."
3,The one feature that I liked about this ...,"The one feature that I liked about this product in particular was its pleasant fragrance. It was not overpowering, as some are, which made it usable for my husband as well as myself. We feel the product could be improved by substituting a snap-on lid for the screw-top lid. The product did not provide a rich enough lather. Therefore, I felt I needed to use more than was necessary. As a whole, I would not say that this is a bad product, but I would not go out of my way to recommend it, either."
4,"First, I have to say that I don't ...","First, I have to say that I don't normally like shower gels, but this one really did make my skin feel more hydrated, softer, and less itchy in cold weather. I'm very picky and highly suspect of product claims, but I do recommend this product for those with good taste. Additionally, I would suggest using a very soft cloth and applying this product very gently for two reasons: one, a gentle application helps make your skin softer, and two, this product doesn't lather up like many other inferior products that lather up very well but just don't deliver. This one actually does, and I'd really buy it and honestly recommend it."
4,The Ahava Mineral Shower Gel was a great ...,"The Ahava Mineral Shower Gel was a great product. The scent was very soft and not overpowering. After using the product for a few days, my skin definitely feels softer. I found using a shower puff greatly enhanced my experience. The shower gel lathered up nicely. The only thing I would suggest is that they switch to a flip-top lid. I found trying to open it in the shower to be a little frustrating. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends."
5,Best softball book,"I've read most of the fast-pitch softball books on the market and this is by far the best. It is thorough, yet concise. It is equally useful for beginning coaches and advanced coaches. I especially like the Defensive Strategies chapter that details many game situations and defenses for those situations. This book also covers the gamut of coaching softball, from philosophy to organization to the game itself to post-season considerations."
4,For Youth Softball - Good Reference,"This book is comprehensive and is aimed at the coach of a team consisting of younger or much younger players. Kathy Veroni sounds like a tough, fair, and thorough coach. Imagine driving a group of late-arriving players 10 miles out of town and telling then to jog back to practice. No wonder West Illinois U has a great softball team.However, as a captain of a mens' fastpitch softball team, with players who play once a week, this book did not help me much. The drills were just too involved and required a much higher commitment and lower physical strength than I have from the guys on my team. It's like using a college-level calculus text when all you want to learn is high school algebra.Having said that, the big plus of this book is the VERY EXTENSIVE list of both defensive and offensive drills. This section of the book makes the purchase price worthwhile."
1,Screw strips out with normal use.,The metal strips out that a screw that holds the balde turns into. The blade and tool can then not be used and the tool becomes useless. This occured with below normal home use.
5,I'm guilty but I don't feel bad,"I live in Southern Ontario. Years ago I borrowed this book from a library and loved it so much I told them I lost it and paid for it (I think it was around $25) and now that I see the cheapest one is $92 I don't feel quite as bad. This is the best book about an Arabian I have ever read. The part when the Russians took the majority of the breeding stock at Janow broke my heart-what a loss for all of Poland forever. And the sacrifices that the Polish people made to save all those horses was incredible. And of course when Witez won the Championship, I too, am moved to tears every time I read this. I have always thought that someone should make a movie of this story-it's not just a 'horse story' but a great story of struggle and survival of the Polish people. (I am Polish-my grandfather fought in WWII.) I have even made Witez's name my email address-if you live in S. Ont. and have any descendants of him you can send me pics - trwitez@hotmail.com"
1,"Misleading ""features""","This is my last year for Turbotax. One of the ""features"" is the ability to ""Import from Quicken ... software"". But, this does NOT work with Quicken 2000.You can't actually get an online rebate through their ""online rebate form"". You end up going to the online form, printing out the form, and mailing that in. How is that better than mailing in the coupon that is included in the box?And, as some of the other reviewers have noted, many of the nice features that were in the ""Deluxe"" version the past few years have moved into the ""Premier"" version. So every year you buy the ""Deluxe"" version you get less than the year before."
2,Valuable features moved to Premiere!,"I've used Turbo Tax and Quicken for many years, and am sorry to say they just keep getting worse and worse. One of the best features of Turbo Tax Deluxe USED to be walking us through complex and confusing employee stock purchase plan and stock options. But I just discovered that in 2004, you have to buy TurboTax PREMIERE, for another $30, for this feature, that used to be in Deluxe!Also, I've had some problems with importing data from Quicken and from financial institutions -- features I've used for many years. Importing data from Quicken, Turbo Tax claims the cost basis and date of some fund sales are missing, but they were in Quicken. Importing from my financial institution, everything downloaded correctly, but was obscured by duplicate forms (primarily 1099-DIV) that had been imported from last year's data. An obfuscation bug, if you will.But I can't believe they took a good, basic feature and bumped it up to Premiere!"
1,The most over-rated product and biggest rip-off ever,"Bought this when a friend recommended it every so highly. Should've known better. This product is DREADFUL! I honestly wish I'd have seen the reviews on Amazon before I made my purchase. Support is non-existent. The downloading just doesn't happen. I've already wasted 2.5 hours on this, the mirror site download would've taken over 6.5 hours. I'm going to file manually (thank GOD something told me to try this a day in advance of 4/15), and demand a refund from TurboTax. I'll never buy this again. If I could give it less stars than one, I would."
3,Employee stock capability NOT included this year,"Unlike prior years, Deluxe does not include the ability to include employee stock option or other employee stock income ... you have to buy the Premier version."
1,CALCULATES DIFFERENT TAX EVERY TIME I OPEN PRGM.,"HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM? THERE IS NO ""CALCULATE"" BUTTON, AND EVERY TIME I CLOSE & REOPEN TURBOTAX, IT CALCULATES A DIFFERENT TAX--SOMETIMES IT SAYS I HAVE A REFUND, AND AT OTHER TIMES IT CALCULATES A ""TAX DUE""! UNBELIEVABLE!"
2,No support for Stock Option / Plan Transactions,"I have been using TurboTax for 5 years and it has always supported all types of employee stock plan transactions in the interview. Now, apparently we are forced to buy Premier if we want to have the same functionality."
1,Buyer Beware,"Purchased the Deluxe version that had a rebate and claimed to have the state included. Based on previous experience with TurboTax I knew it meant a download... not a problem.Then the problems hit. First TurboTax did not recognize my DSL connection. The only help from TurboTax was to download the update file and manually install. OK, just a bump in the road.Then I go to download the state tax and it wants a creditcard. Why? No mention in the hardcopy documentation, nothing on the outside of the box. Finally found the info buried in the help menu. Pay for the download then get a rebate. Wait a minute wasn't this included. Purchasing state and submitting rebates is very confusing (I've used the product for almost 10 years). Still unsure if rebate will be paid, tried to call support 20 minute wait no answer. Tried online support via messaging given the brush off twice. Poor service and deceptive sales practice."
1,"Overrated & incomplete- You don't ""GOT PEOPLE""","As a tax professional, I would highly discourage anyone from taking on the challenge of doing their taxes if it involves more than W-2's. Even with some of the most expensive software, information is not properly transferred to the state return, especially in WI where everything is behind, inbetween and many cases, manual adjustments need to be made. If you have children in college or are trying to maximize your deductions through self-employment or retirement contributions, or strategize double itemizing, you need a professional or a long time to read IRS and state Pubs. There is no magic box, but you can find a reasonable tax preparer without all of the fancy overhead such as the ones trying to sell you a guarantee that they did their work properly. Yikes! In the long run it is better to really have PEOPLE than the sea monkeys in a box. Worst part is the IRS/states are so far behind, you won't even know if you messed up until about two years later!"
5,"Initially, I couldn't get update to work, but...","The download update kept giving me an error message after it hung at 68% for a minute. I thought it was because the server was too 'busy', but then I tried it at 4 AM- same error message. I later found that it was actually my routers fault- there's a MTU setting that needs to be set (mine is now set to 192 and set to active, you need to 'log on' to your router to set this). After I set it, I had no problems with downloading the update and finishing the return. (I'm running Windows XP on a modern Dell PC).Overall, the program is easy to use, but I would still recommend at least going over the entire return by hand. Since it's not the Premier version, it may omit the opportunity for you to include items that will save you money, such business expenses, for example. And if your return is complicated, it's likely you'd be better off with an accountant or professional tax preparation service."
1,turbotax sucks,"Whatever you do, don't get this tax program. It took me forever to do my taxes on it. When I was finally done with my taxes, turbotax found an error and wanted me to download to fix the errors so I tried and that was a mistake. It wouldn't download anything! The program kept telling me it could not find anything to download! What really made me upset about turbotax is the electronic file. Turbotax charges you 14.95 for each tax form you want to send electronically and an additional 19.95 if you want to direct deposit! For all the money I paid for this crappy program I am to get ripped off an additional fifty bucks!?"
4,Works great with 10.3.4 and a G4 IBook,"I was discouraged to read some other reviews stating that the State Tax side of Turbo Tax didn't work, or work well, on Macs running OS X. My experience was just the opposite. I use an IBook running 10.3.4 and found that both federal and state (VA) Turbotax Deluxe worked perfectly. I recommend this product."
1,Faulty Automatic Updating Turns Program to Junk,"Intuit releases the program full of bugs and omissions and periodically releases updates to fix this. O.K. Not ideal, but TaxCut does the same thing.However, this year, TurboTax not infrequently has a problem in the updates. The TT website suggests that you uninstall *everything* and try reinstalling from the CD and then updating again from scratch. Did that. However, an uninstall doesn't really clean out everything and it still can't update. At this point, I just can't reliably use the program and I can't get the updates that are necessary to make the program work. Terrible."
1,Avoid TT,"Unless your tax situation is extremely simnple, avoid Turbo Tax 2004. My disc did not include IRS Schedule E and therefore it could not produce my complete finished return. INTUIT knew when it peddled the disc that it was defective, and toward the end of my return admitted that. Yet it omitted from the packaging any mention of the inadequacy. It was hidden.So far, Intuit's support system has been useless about curing the defect.I have written to the Federal Trade Commission about what I think was deceptive marketing. Being what it is, the FTC will probably do nothing. Still, along with not buying TT next year, (which I won't) calling FTC's attention to marketing practices is at least something a customer can do."
1,No employee stock purchase plan support,"DON'T buy this product if you have stock plans from your employer. This does not support ESPP and employee stock options as previous years ""deluxe"" line. You'll have to purchase the ""premier"" version. This really sucks. I think this is the last year I am going to purchase Turbotax."
1,Pathetic Attempt at Software,"Wow, who bought TurboTax? A group of kindergartners? This used to be a premeir tax software oackage, but I would recommend a pencil & paper over this product today. IT DOES NOT WORK! It can't do it's downloads and blames that on firewalls/security (funny, even my free game software can download through my firewall). This is the worst version ever, I will NOT buy anything from intuit/turbotax again. I will use HR Block next year. This is not worth the hassle. turbotax (not capitalized because they don't deserve to be) owes us all a refund!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE, YOU CAN HAVE MINE. (NO, SORRY, I WOULDN""T WISH THIS ON ANYONE)"
2,"Average results, poor customer service","I have used Turbotax for about 7 years, but am now going to go with Tax-Cut.The last two years my returns had calculation errors in the state return and I had to write the state a check both years.The Intuit customer service is terrible. I had a technical problem with the program last year and could not get in touch with anyone at Intuit - absolutely impossible to get service. No returns to my email. I ended up having to pay another $40 to buy a replacement product, and never got my money back from Intuit, never heard from them.Last year I bought Turbo-tax from their mailing, only to find out if I bought from the store I could have got $10 more off. Great way to treat return customers."
1,"After 4 hidden fees, I paid 115$ after rebates for Turbotax","Pros:One of the two print functions actually works! Only one gives you the option of writing to a PDF file in case you don't have a printer connected to the computer you've installed the software upon.Cons:If you go with Turbo Tax, here is what you will pay:1. 30$ for federal (60 for all but the most basic returns)2. 30$ for state3. 30$ MORE dollars for any other state you lived in during the year4. 25$ to Intuit for a electronic filing fee.5. 30$ to santa barbara bank and trust for being friends with Intuitleast total: 115.00$suggested intuit total: 210.00$If you want any help whatsoever itemizing your deductions, they generously include a 'deduction-lite' program which promptly requests your credit card without giving you a semblance of deduction itemization help. If you beleive in anything that is good and righteous, you will avoid Turbotax and Intuit like Herpes."
3,TT Deluxe missing State,"The TT Deluxe product does not include the state product. It includes a rebate form. You still need to buy the state product and then submit the rebate form to get the $29.99 back. Net effect is ""free"" but any statement about the product being included is bogus."
4,TurboTax Multistate now works for the mac,"According to Intuit's website:RESOLUTION:Remove the Multi-State CD from your computer's CD-ROM drive.Click here (go to their site) to download the TurboTax_State_Update.hqx file, which will correct this issue.After the file has finished downloading, double-click the TurboTax State Update icon to install it.Click OK in the ""You can now install TurboTax state"" window, re-insert the Multi-State CD, and install your state program.MORE INFORMATION:This issue was resolved in the update (#2) released on January 6, 2005 and should not appear in subsequent TurboTax Multi-State CDs that include this update."
1,Doesn't do a good job with stock options,"The product keeps deteriorating every year. Issues I've had:- This year's turbo tax deluxe doesn't accommodate stock options in its interview process. I searched the help section and was told that this was available in the premier version only. Needless to say, Turbo Tax doesn't clearly identify this issue in its advertising & this is potentially fraudulent given that the 2003 product did accommodate stock option exercises. I tricked the system but walked away with a very bad taste in my mouth. I've never heard of a program taking features away over time! This is terrible.- Doesn't automatically calculate the sales tax rate when you ask for the sales tax deduction. You have to find that info offline and plug the rate into the box & turbo tax will do you the favor of calculating that."
4,Buy it,"Unlike the recent ""Global Underground"" releases (""Ibiza""-Sasha, ""Hong Kong""-Digweed, Nick Warren) that I find great but a little bit repetitive -except Seb Fontaine's Prototypes that are unique- this set is different. CD 1 is excellent, very emotional, the kind of deep house music that gets into your soul. It's brilliantly mixed, ""full of promises and good vibes"". Full of feelings, it really takes you away. CD 2 is more of a dark trance style although not very heavy. I must say that after hearing CD1, I was expecting much more from the second. Believe me, the first CD of the set is worth getting it."
3,A tale of two discs,"The first disc of this set is one of the best Global Underground CDs you can buy. It's deep, dirty, techy house that is at once both infectious and brooding. Pappa blends the perfect amount of tripped out vocals with tight syncopated rythyms and deep groovy basslines. No cheesy breakdowns here. The disc would be flawless were it not for the inclusion of a very boring mix of Trancesetters ubiquitous track, ""Roaches."" Of all the mixes of this track, and believe me there are plenty, why he chose this one is beyond me. Other than that, however, disc one is outstanding, either for listening to or for dancing. Disc 2 on the other hand is, in my opinion, terrible. It's like trance on crack, as if trance itself weren't bad enough. It's entirely evil sounding, repetitious, and seems designed to solicit bad moods when played through. Buy this CD, if only for the first disc."
5,ruff riders!,"this cd was ruff and rugged man. i was breakin stuff when I started listening too it and it just got me breaking some more! I love that Humate song, I started ripping off my wall paper when it came on. I also really liked the Moonface jams, I kicked my cat in the side during one of them! Overall, its dark tech-house and trance that will get you FIRED UP. Buy it. The second part of disc 2 is worth the price of the disc alone. I went wild from song 9 on - kicking the dog around, tipping over my fridge, throwing rocks...the works. I regret it now - my house is a wreck - but I DON'T REGRET BUYING THIS CD. IT BLOODY ROCKS>"
4,Dark Trance,"Yo, Follow the Global Underground trail and this boy is up and coming...Like this CD a lot.. He is no Oakey or Sasha... I would say more of a Seb Fontaine feel to this CD... If you like Prototype 1 and 2 then you will love what Big Pappa has to offer!"
2,Poor track selection,"One interesting thing about techno music is that no matter how good it is, it always comes very close to being really bad: take away one little sound effect, one short sample, place some sample at the wrong time and the whole song turns monotonous. To work, a techno track must have all those little elements in the right place and time. Most of the songs on this CD don't. They seemed way too monotonous to me, way too simplistic. If you want cool underground electrnica, get Hong Kong by Digweed."
5,a way to live life better,"If you can improv, you can live better. When you learn to think on your feet, turn a phrase without a blink, you can solve more of life's problems easier. Bree teaches how to be imaginative and to utilize your imagination. These exercises, elementary as they may seem, stretch you and make you think and react. It is fun, stress relieving, and mentally stimulating. Grab a group of friends and try some of the suggestions...it will be the best time you've had in awhile. And if you practice improv regularly, you will begin to use your brain to think with newness and with invention. I took Bree's class in Improv and found that I could actually come up with some pretty funny lines and my response time to my partners was much quicker than I would ever have expected. This teaches you to think on your feet!"
3,Good but rather elementary,"Good for a beginning actor interested in improv, but it doesn't have the range of Spolin, the energy/straightforward style of Atkins or the experience of Johnstone. Useful for teachers."
3,This is one of the better cd projects I have in my colletion,"I have been a fan of big band music all of my life. When I purchased this cd set, what a thrill it was to hear this old music again.This band does a good job of revising these old work horse tunes, but remaining true to the songs. The band keep the old sounds alive with their arrangements. The instrumentaion is that of the old bands. It uses no electronic instruments. Hooray for the band!The band choose to record most of my favorite songs. It threw in a few tunes that I didn't know, but i'm sure a lot of people will recognize them.The arrnagers Roland Shaw and Barry Forge really did a good job with their arrangemnts. These are some of the best arrangemtns I have ever heard.All in all, I think everyone did their part to contibute to this project. I would like to say thank you to everyone who was a paart of this fabilous cd set.Recommendation: I can gladly recommend this cd set."
4,Great set....except a minor flaw,"I have just received this set and have enjoyed many of the arrangements. I am very disappointed that on Disc(2), ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" is really Ellington's ""In My Solitude"".I was looking forward to owning BBC's version of 'Choo Choo as it is very well done."
2,Beautiful shoe but,"not bronze, pewter is more accurate; had to return as one shoe defective, sharp plastic trim dug into side of foot & both really narrow; I've had AK shoes before, I hope quality isn't going downhill; gave 2* for design, one for each shoe..."
3,Generic title is generic,"So it's not a bad film if you're bored and you're like me and need something to watch while doing other things. The actors are all good looking, the little girl was a good actress (except when she was doing the crazy laughter, but that's hard to do well so I'll cut her some slack.) The cinematography and sets were nice but the plot. Oh the plot. The hook about a journalist investigating sex scandals is never developed. That is left behind fairly quickly. The story that is there instead, the one that actually relates to the ""scary"" phone, is well-developed and the pacing is good, but it's a very, very common one. The ending was fine, exciting almost.The main problem is that it is supposed to be a horror movie and it's not very frightening. You could anticipate most of the moments where they wanted you to jump. And let's face it, cellphones as a ubiquitous appliance are relatively recent but phones in general are not. They are not scary."
3,Unimpressive,"To be honest, I expected more. At least ""Ryeong"" had an amazing twist ending, and Cello delivered a stellar performance from Hyeon-a Seong, but Phone offers a predictable twist ending and a little girl who manages to upstage every adult actor in the movie.I don't think the director was expecting that."
2,Familiar fright fare,"A typical horror film, albeit done with skill. The first half is pretty much just a sequence of fright scenes. Then it switches to a psychological story with supernatural elements which I found much more interesting. The finale, however, is predictable and not very scary.The lovely Ha Ji Won is the star and she's joined by some beautiful actresses that are equally put upon. But it's gonna be 5-year-old Eun Seo-woo who's gonna make the deepest impression on you. I promise. She has about a dozen scenes scattered thru out the movie with her stunningly acted climactic scene coming shortly before the film's climax. I'll bet she'll amaze you even if the story or the other actors don't."
1,Boring not frightening,"Another telephone horror flick. Only this movie did not produce a single thrill.I had to fight to stay awake during this one. Also, most of the plot seemed to be borrowed from some other movie.Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
3,Phone,"this movie was okay, worth a watch the story line was pretty decent but i think they need to put more into... well you'll see what i mean"
2,Scary...the phone is ringing.,"The storyline was rather bland and maybe it's just me, but the whole concept of people being scared when their phone is ringing has been highly played out. There was one part that made me jump, but other than that, there isn't anything too scary and/or gory. The child actress in this movie, was not very convincing. Everytime she was ""going crazy"", I couldn't help but laugh at the poor acting.The DVD title screen for this movie is my favorite part. I kept thinking my own cell phone was interfering with the DVD player. haha. Anyhow, I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing better to do."
3,Slick and glossy but not very scary,"Phone is a highly slick and glossy horror flick which doesn't fall into the same convoluted and confusing category of most Asian horror. What it lacks in scares, it makes up with a very linear, easy to follow plot albeit predictable in a Hollywood kind of way.It has it moments of scares and if you're new to the creepy and atmospheric world of Asian horror this is a good starting point. If nothing else, it's worth checking out for the stunning performance of that amazing little 6 year old girl. She gives a performance worthy of an Oscar. This certianly isn't Ringu or Ju-On because it didn't scare me but it's entertaining and still a notch above anything Hollywood would do."
4,watch this before reading 'Cell',"A teenage school girl becomes infatuated with a married man.The married man has a young daugther already at home and tries to break up with the schoolgirl after she tells him shes pregnant.Well.Without giving too much away - the girl ends up out of the frame and there appears to be a 'pulse' - yes, a 'pulse' as in 'Cell' ah-hem, thats makes people crazy to hear it on their mobile and also ends in some horrific deaths for the new owners of the young girls mobile number.Before 'Cell' by Stephen King there was 'Phone'Remember where you read it first."
5,"If Country is a person, Gary Gene Watson would be him","What else can be said. Gene Watson is one of the finest traditional country singers of this lifetime. I had the opportunity to se him ain Angleton Tx. several years ago and he only proved what a talent he truly is. Country radio should be ashamed of itself for neglecting such talents as Watson,Joe Stampley, Eddie Raven, Gary Stewart and more. Even sadder. Nashville has turned thier backs on these stars only to turn out mindless cross over fodder. This collection is a must for any Gene Watson fan, and for any real country music fans. Every cut tells a story, and every story comes to life when Watson puts his powerful voice to it."
4,This guy is COUNTRY with capitol letters!,"Since I don't like today's country (since the mid 90's)and herein Europe we don't have country radio stations to listen to, theonly way to hear country is buying CD's from the States somethingI'm doing since the past 18 months. These mostly are from the70's and 80's and I am so happy to re-discover all those artistsI used to listen to during my many business trips through the USAand whose LP's I always brought back after each trip. Now I amrecuperating them on CD and buying many I didn't have then ordidn't even know the existence of. This is the case with GeneWatson. Last month I received ""Ultimate Collection"" and gave it5 stars. Gee, how I love his music. I would have liked to givethese ""18 greatest hits"" 5 stars as well but again I received aCD with zero information. Who wrote these songs? When were theyrecorded? Does the record company release them this way to cutdown prices? What a shame."
4,somewhat on the mellow side...sort of,"Iggy Pop has put out some of the most controversial songs ever recorded to disk, and tracks like DOG FOOD, KNOCKIN' THEM DOWN (IN THE CITY) and I SNUB YOU are no exception. Sadly, those are the best three on the entire album. To be fair, it's not a bad album, but some of the songs are rooted in keyboard-driven garage rock (LOCO MOSQUITO)that lessens the impact. The two bonus tracks are pretty good, the second one an instrumental. Either way, if you're into Iggy doing garage rock, or if you wanna hear three ripping tracks that could've come straight off a Dead Boys album, then get this."
4,backtothebeginning,"""My mommy told me if i was goody she would buy me a rubber dolly"". A very Stooges way to start an album, which is what makes it so good. After two albums with the great David Bowie, Iggy returns to smudge it in your face rock n' roll. ""Loco Mosquito"" rocks hard as does ""Dog Food"". And ""Play It Safe"" should be considered an all-time Iggy classic. Iggy surrounds himself with one of the best backing bands of all time for this one. Definitely a must own."
5,Each episode like a movie. Very well done in every way.,"The acting, the stories, the dreary settings. Everything about this series was well done. It really did feel like you were watching a new movie each time as the episodes are very long.The main character Wallander himself you just feel that he's that guy.... so well acted. If you like the British crime series, like your shows a bit on the darker, real-side this is a must see."
1,bad bad bad bedding,"very thin , poor quality sheets. the pillow case is so narrow it is useless. I think the paper in the shipping box would keep you warmer.they are now dog bedding!"
2,Flannel Herringbone Queen Set,"Not fully satisfied with this one, have several sets of Pinzon 150 gram sheets. Quality of material is good, medium thickness, correct amount of warmth required. However after two machine washings the stitching along one of the pillowcases came undone and had to be resewn."
2,Beautiful...then you wash them...,"These sheets are very nice looking and quite soft. HOWEVER, on first wash, they got all ""pilly"" and look like I've had them for years, not one day. They still feel nice, they just don't look as nice as they should. If you plan NEVER to wash them, they're perfect!"
5,Looks just like my ERNIE,"I carry this ""toy"" on the dashboard of my car. He is a constant reminder of my dearly departed cat ERNIE. He is a very welcome sight. If you don't want to carry him with you in your car, you can put him beside your bed or easy chair and cuddle him. I highly recomend him."
3,Here the Lion roar..........and then some.,"I really couldn't wait to hear this! but I wish I would've heard it before I purchased it.Willie ""the Lion"" Smith is one of the great Stride Pianist along with Lucky Roberts.this CD does contain some excellent tracks of Willie's music BUT he narrates the whole thing before the songs, during the songs and after.......I guess its nice to get the info on who he got the ideas from for a riff and who he played it with and what era it was in and his technique but it gets to be too much.Its great to hear the legends actual voice but it doesn't have to be almost every song, the narration is longer than the songs.SO!! in short if you want to hear great music uninterupted (like me) don't buy this and if you want to learn about Willie maybe you have an essay on him, well then this is your CD"
5,Mississippi Fred McDowell,"If you are a blues fan and have never heard Mississippi Fred McDowell, you are missing something great."
3,you can find it cheaper under its other entry,"As I write this review (September 2007), this same disc can be found for incredibly cheap under its other entry:American Virtuoso. See my review thereunder."
5,Perfect,"Scalable parallel systems or, more generally, distributed memory systems offer a challenging model of computing and pose fascinating problems regarding compiler optimization, ranging from language design to run time systems. Research in this area is foundational to many challenges from memory hierarchy optimizations to communication optimization.This unique, handbook-like monograph assesses the state of the art in the area in a systematic and comprehensive way. The 21 coherent chapters by leading researchers provide complete and competent coverage of all relevant aspects of compiler optimization for scalable parallel systems. The book is divided into five parts on languages, analysis, communication optimizations, code generation, and run time systems. This book will serve as a landmark source for education, information, and reference to students, practitioners, professionals, and researchers interested in updating their knowledge about or active in parallel computing."
3,Not impressed,"I ordered the ""Southern Belle Dress"" costume for my 11 year old daughter. I am not impressed with this costume for the price...I would think that this custume would cost far less! It isn't even that cute. Also, the sizing was off. I ordered a ""M"", which was to be an 8-10. My daughter is thin and short/average height. She could have used a ""L"", which was listed to be a 12-14."
3,The hat was missing....,"The hat was missing from the package, which was a disappointment. The dress had obviously been removed from it's package, refolded and put back in the bag without the hat. Otherwise it is a cute costume and my daughter liked it."
4,Don't make us wait for the next one!,"Beautiful, beautiful.It's rare these days I feel inspired to take a new CD home, and even rarer that I love a new record from beginning to end.Beautiful, soulful music sung by a man I want to hear so much more from. I've now got 10 more favorite songs to add to my all time list of favorites. ""My Old Friend the Blues"", ""Road of No Return"", ""Big Blue Diamonds"", and so many others. Can you wear out a CD? I might wear this one out from replaying it.And it's not just me. I played this in my office and everyone loved it.Enough for now, I'm going to go back and listen to this treasure again!"
5,Laugh out loud funny!,"The Book of Bob is one of those rare books that made me laugh out loud in public. Just describing the premise - that God (aka ""Dad"") has chosen to write a new blockbuster through a new prophet (Bob) - is enough to provoke giggles. It also suggests that there may be irreverent satire ahead. Knowing Paul Chasman and his work as ""Carl Estrada,"" I was prepared. However, if you're looking for angry political rants against conservatives, go find a blog. All forms of 21st-century wackiness are fair game for Dad's mockery. This book is so funny, I forgot it had an agenda!"
1,Stupid!,"Maybe it's my sense of humor, but I thought this book was stupid. I had purchased it for a friend named ""Bob"" but decided not to give it to him."
4,True to the times,John Kilzers C.D. was a good reflection of MY times in the 80's good times and reaility bites lol!
4,this is cool old school music,excellent cd in great condition. I love George Clinton and this is definately cool old school music.
2,Wake me up when the album ends.,"OK, When I pressed play I was expecting to hear a rock masterpeice as so many have put it... however what I heard was anything but a masterpeice. The songs are... how should I put this... boring. The songs are boring and that is all there is to it. I like classic rock, but I didn't expect a boring country album. Being a Stones album I expected there to be plenty of country elements, but this is just a country album. Its not rock. Frankly, If you are a country fan I am sure you will enjoy it, but if you are looking for an interesting rock album, don't buy this. Its really not too impressive. I give it 2.5 stars for good lyrics and guitar playing, which I do respect this album for.ok I will admit.. Gimme Shelter is a good song."
2,leave it be.,i have many rolling stones albums and thought this one would be good to add to the collection. i own an old rolling stones album called big hits high tide and green grass which has better quality sound than this one and i can actually make out the lyrics. whether that's because of the recording quality or the songs themselves i don't know. i like the stones but wouldn't buy this album. i have most of the songs on later releases and the others i don't really like.
1,Overrated,"This was effectively an LP between Brian Jones and Mick Taylor. They really did not have their trademark 2 guitar sound and Jimmy Miller really fails on the production side. Almost everything on the album is far better live. Gimmie Shelter, Midnight Rambler, Love In Vain all fair much better when they get worked out live with Mick Taylor on board. Midnight Rambler shows none of its potential in this studio version and Country Honk is sad filler at best not even a shadow of Honky Tonk Women with MT. Some good songs like You Can't Always Get What You Want which really is the theme of the LP since you don't get anything near the potential that might have been. A really sloppy and uneven album."
2,LETS GET THE FACTS RIGHT!,"SORRY, BUT THIS WAS NOT THE ALBUM THAT WAS ON TOP TO CLOSE OUT THE SIXTIES! LET IT BLEED HIT NO 3 ON THE TOP 40 CHART,AND FADED AFTER 19 WEEKS. LED ZEPPELIN 2 HIT NO 1 FOR 7 WEEKS,CREEDENCE HIT NO 1 FOR 4 WEEKS WITH GREEN RIVER, AND SURPRISE SURPRISE, ABBEY ROAD BY THE BEATLES WAS NO 1 FOR 11 WEEKS,STAYING IN THE TOP 40 FOR 32 WEEKS. IT'S ALSO RETURNED TO THE TOP 100 OFF AND ON OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS AND HAS TOPPED 30 MILLION SOLD WORLDWIDE TO DATE! THIS IS HOW THE SIXTIES REALLY WENT OUT! THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW! LET IT BLEED HAS A COUPLE DECENT TRACTS BUT GOT TROUNCED BY THE COMPETITION AT THE TIME."
2,Overrated,This was supposed to be one of the best Stones albums. Sucks. If you love the stones you'll probably like it though. I'm shocked at how bad of a singer Mick is. Get Sticky Fingers if you must.
5,Late sixties classic,"You can't always get what you want; Midnight Rambler, Monkey Man: What more could you ask for? Classic Stones album"
5,"the rolling stones best album of the 60,s let it bleed!!!!","the rolling stones let it bleed is one of their best albums ever,let it bleed was released in december of 1969 which unfortuneatly was the year guitarist and founding member brian jones died shortly after being asked to leave the band for many personal reasons bettween, brian,mick and kieth..when brian left the stones hired mick taylor as new lead guitarist and did the very succesful let it bleed tour..also on that very same tour of 1969 the stones gave the infamous free concert at altamont speedway in northern california and hired the hell,s angels as security!!!!needless to say that was a bad decision and strangely enough when they played sympathy for the devil the angels killed meredith hunter.however the album,s fine points are,gimme shelter,midnight rambler,let it bleed,live with me and you can,t always get what you want this album is a must for any stones fan!!!"
4,You can almost taste the grit,"It seems strange to me that the actual song ""Let it Bleed"" isn't more popular. It sums up the whole of this album so well, with it's hard blues riffs, quick country beat and lyrics that are both sentimental and eerie. The Stones are truly masters at bringing different elements to play in their music, and this is one of their best efforts. But a few modern bands have enough talent and courage to mix things together like this (the Beastie Boys and R.E.M. come to mind); the more's the pity for younger fans like myself."
5,One of the Stones' best,"This is definitely one of the Rolling Stones' best known albums, and its recognition is well-deserved. If nothing else, this album produced three great hits (Gimme Shelter, Live with Me, You Can't Always Get What you Want). But the rest of the album is great as well.The sound quality on this album is good--it's not great, but then what do you expect from Britain in the lates sixties? The remastering was done well, and the sound improved considerably with this.For many casual Stones fans, there are many greatest hits and live albums that will suffice. But for the rest of us, those of us who love the band's style of music and want everything we can get, Let It Bleed remains one of the Rolling Stones' best studio albums."
5,FANTABULOUS,ONE OF THE BEST STONE'S ALBUMS PRODUCED! SIMPLY GREAT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IT WILL ENDURE TIME. CRANK MONKEY MAN UNTIL THE GLASS SHATERS!!!!
1,WILL NOT PLAY ON YOUR COMPUTER!!,This is a great album but be prepared for the fact that this album is copy protected and it will not play on your computer.
3,"Excellant CD, Poor packaging",Great CD. The sequence of the songs listed on the back of the CD are in an incorrect order. The CD plays the correct order.
2,Get 'Exile on Main Street' instead,"If you don't know what the Stones sound like, get Hot Rocks as an intro. If you want an album that captures the real soul and essence of the band, get the above. Nuff said."
3,You cant always believe what you hear,"A couple of good songs here. Monkey Man, and Gimme Shelter. ""You cant always..."" is one of the most over-rated songs in the history of music. This album is the Stones second in their run of four decent albums. I feel this is the weakest of all four(but not nearly the weakest Stones album). Id recommend not buying this record, instead purchasing the ""Hot Rocks"" collection of the best Stones songs. But if you can find it in a ""Used"" section, then its probably worth the Six bucks if only only for the guitar intro on ""Gimme Shelter"". As with most Stones records, Jaggers voice just doesnt carry a whole album. Mick Taylor made this band, and gave it new life. Anything without him is nothing special(Except some of the stuff on ""Some Girls). There early stuff was decent, when they were playing the Beatles little brothers. Didnt the Beatles write a song for them? Get Stick Fingers, and Hot Rocks, and that will about cover it for the Stones."
1,Bleed myself white suffering this crud,"This album is generally insufferable, how lazy could the boys be ripping off the title from the Beatles. Only ever gave this a listen after the Stones got big around 1990 when I decided to go back and dig up some of their early indie stuff. Steel Wheels rolls this one over anyday."
3,more expectations,I check this album out from a local library i had high expectations for it. I thought the rolling stones they are a ledgendaring band they must be good. What i can tell you is i was seriusly let down. I dont know only listen to it once had some good tracks but defintly not worth buying. I think maybe i just needed to give it some mre spins or i had been listening to the new york dolls to much and thought it would be more up beat like that but i don't know the rolling stones still did alot for rock and roll and only worth buying for historical value.
3,Historical Revisionism!!,Why is the original order of songs scrambled on this re-release? The songs on the record were:1.Gimmer Shelter2.Love In Vain3.Country Honk4.Live With Me5.Let It Bleed(side 2)6.Midnight Rambler7.You got the Silver8.Monkey Man9.Can't Always Get What You WantIt's a bad decision; both historically and aesthetically.
5,We all need an album we can bleed on!!!,"I can't really add anything to what's been already said!!!I personally think it's their second best effort (Exile on Main Street being the first) & has some of their best tunes, Gimme Shelter, Country Honk, Let it Bleed, Monkey Man, You can't always get what you want. It was also their second of four consecutive classic albums, the other previously being Beggars Banquet, whilst Sticky Fingers & Exile on Main Street were what followed!!!So if you like rock, add this to your damn collection now!!!!"
5,Great Sound - Great Classic,"If you're wondering which CD of this Stones classic to get, get this one. The digitalized remastering process here sounds almost as good as pristine heavyweight vinyl. And for younger listeners, if you've never heard ""Let It Bleed"", you're in for a ride. From the first quiet haunting notes of ""Gimme Shelter"" to the tongue in cheek choral intro and outro of ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" - with plenty of hard rockin' in between - it's the Stones at one of their all-time peaks."
5,My favorite Stones Record,"This is my favorite Rolling Stones album. It has two of my favorite Stones songs on it, Gimmie Shelter and You Can't Always Get What You Want. These two songs is one of the many reasons to buy this cd. Also the production is good. Plus Mick Taylor's debut. Other favorites include Love in Vain, Country Honk, Midnight Rambler, You Got the Silver, and Monkey Man. Highly recommended"
5,Let it Bleed,Let It BleedIf you want definitive Rolling Stones at their creative and rocking peak buy Let it Bleed and Sticky Fingers. All others pale before them. These 2 are the reason the Stones were known as the best rock'n roll band in the world.
3,The Stones need a better record label....,"The track listing as it is on the back of the CD (and on Amazon) is incorrect. The actual track listing is as follows: 1) Gimme Shelter 2) Love In Vain 3) Country Honk 4) Live With Me 5) Let It Bleed 6) Midnight Rambler 7) You Got The Silver 8) Monkey Man 9) You Can't Always Get What You Want.It's bad enough that Abkco is too lazy to remaster the early Stones albums (as Virgin has done with the later ones), but they can't even list the songs in the right order on the CD. That's pathetic. The correct song order however is listed on the inside liner.As for the album itself, it's a mixed bag. Several of the songs are great (YCAGWYW, Midnight Rambler, Let It Bleed, Gimme Shelter, Monkey Man), the rest are mediocre. I'd give the music four stars if for nothing else than the excellent You Can't Always Get What You Want, but the CD (especially the packaging) brings that down to three."
5,An excellent album of country blues based rock music,"This album is a pretty eclectic recording. ""Gimme Shelter"" is a haunting, relentless rocker. ""Love in Vain"" and ""Country Honk"" are great country blues tunes. In fact, I like Country Honk better than the rock version ""Honky Tonk Women."" I also marvel at how ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" extends the band's musical reach. The only song I could have lived without was the shallow ""Monkey Man,"" but the rest of the album is absolutely essential. Buy it."
5,"Stones very, very best album.","This is really the first album I ever remember seeing. My German uncles' and cousins' had it when I was Army Brat growing up in Germany 35 years ago. I had a C2 fx in a motorcycle accident in 1980 and having these tunes running through my head made me realize how wonderful life is and truly strengthend my will to live after the emergency room docs gave me less than a 1 % chance to survive. I remember being pumped full of morphine in the hospital and having the tune ""Monkey Man"" going through my head. ""You cant always get what you want"" helped comfort me after my right arm was permanently paralyzed in that wreck. This truly is a very personal album for me and a personal review, but I'll go ahead and post it. Face it, if you love the Stones I'm not telling you anything you don't know already about the quality of these tunes. I'll never tire listening to this and ""Sticky Fingers""."
5,Top Class,"This was the first Rolling Stones records I bought. I heard 'Gimme Shelter' and 'Monkey Man' on Martin Scorsese's film 'Goodfella's' and bought the album for those two songs. I was surprised to find that the whole album was packed with songs that reflected great musical ability and a rare originality. Perhaps the most talked about song on this album is 'You Can't Always Get What You Want', however it's by no means the best track on this album, the rest of the songs are much better; bringing the musical styles of conutry blues, soul and rock together and expressing it in that bad-boy, booze and bacchanalia, Rolling Stones way. I now have almost all the Stones albums- everything up to Tatoo You. Even if you're not an avid Stones fan you should find this album and 'Sticky fingers' very enjoyable. Great music for getting your rocks off!"
5,Stones at their best.,"For Me this is the is the time period in the Stones career when they release some of their most important and rememberablesongs.Gimme Shelter,Midnight Rambled,and You can't get what you want are the obvious choices,but when you add in cuts like love in vain,You got the silver and Monkeman,you have what can only be called a masterpiece!"
5,Blood from a Stone,"This is a great album. It's generally considered to be one of the Stones' best albums, which it is. Rock, blues, country, even a bit of gospel. The Stones were at their peak during this period. I don't need to single out any songs, because they're all good. But I thought I would mention that ""Country Honk"" is an acoustic country-fried version of ""Honkey Tonk Women"", for those who didn't know."
5,Definitely Reccomended,Great one here to pick up. This is the transition album Jones-Taylor and is one of their greatest works. Probably not as good as Sticky Fingers but far better than Beggar's Banquet and Exile.
3,Let`s not confuse new listeners,"It`s incredible how different opinions are, They should be slightly different . Anyway no the best from Rolling Stones for sure."
2,Three Things You Need to Know,"1. Gimme Shelter2. Midnight Rambler3. You Can't Always Get What You WantThese songs are great, but they are available on the multitude of greatest hits collections out there. The rest of the album is forgettable. 2-stars. Sorry."
5,"one of, if not THE greatest, from the Rolling Stones",It's the one i keep coming back to; Beggars Banquet.How can a Parachute Woman not land on this playlist? Stones at their best.
1,Yuuk!,"Arent the Rolling Stones getting alittle old? People ask me then why i listin to the beatles? But theres a big diffrence, the beatles died along time ago the damn stones are still going on! I hate it."
1,no-no!,I like to give my comants on this music. This music is really old and lacks the guts nowadays music has.Also the group uses just tooo little synthesizers and sampled choirs.My advice it is boring oldfashunned and lazy and honors you to live in a bad path.even Emma Em saes he loves his daughter (although I am not a fan at all).Thank you
1,Ttile sound familiar?,That's because the Beatles already released and album called Let It Be. The Rolling Rip-Offs strike again!
1,No no no no mister,"The Rolling Stones sucks. Always did and always will.Charlie Watts can't play, please. Let's be honest. He can't play drums. He's already dead sitting there. Keith Richard can't play lead guitar either. Mick Jagger just be quiet. Bill Wyman, go to sleep and Brian Jones, well he's ok. And unfortunally the only one worth it in that bad died young.Don't get any Cds by this awful band. The Who are wayyyyyyy much better, not to mention the Beatles and The Kinks."
1,The Greatest Rock Band In The World,"What? They arn't the best rock band in the world. The only rocksongs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point?They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the bestrock band in the world. Or maybe they are, they are a great bandbut they are way better than the Who. The Beatles suck!"
1,Hey Read My Negative Rolling Stones Review.,"It is a huge joke that the Rolling Stones could make more than 20 albums in 40 years and each one of their albums suck horribly ever since 1964. They only made two good songs 'Start Me Up' and 'Shattered' and the rest of their songs stink! Their vocalist Mick Thornten wears his hair like a mohawk just can't sing at all and uses makeup like a girl. Keith Richmond, their guitar player is the worst guitar player in the world ever who never took guitar lessons doesn't know any of the chords,always out of tune and only two strings on his pink guitar. Willie Whatts,their drummer cant drum at all never took lessons and he was no comparison to drum greats like Lars Ulrich. Do not buy any Rolling Stones CD,they are the worst band ever besides Pink Floyd. Put Pink Floyd and Rolling Stones albums in the freezer. Mark Knopfler is 10 times better, get the Ragpicker's Dream insted."
1,they shoulds quit,"st single record was named Move on, a lame effort to sound like shingles, which they were beyond a doubt.But to call it evens after somany years would be ok."
5,I love this album,"This is the best record by the world's first hard rock band. The Stones invented hard rock and heavy metal. If the Stones had not come first, you would not have had Zeppelin, Sabbath, Purple, Grand Funk, Aerosmith, and on and on. This band's bluesy, sloppy power lighted the hard rock match. The Who were influenced by them. The Kinks and Yardbirds were influenced by them. Then after they started hard rock, they continued to stay at the top of the genre. This album is classic. When you listen to it, it takes you back to 1969. It makes you remember what you love about classic hard rock. It also makes you sad to see your favorite bands getting old. Long live The Rolling Stones."
4,I can really dig it,"""Let It Bleed"" shows how great The Stones progressed even without Brian Jones. ""Let It Bleed"" over all has a country-blues feel. We have the classic rock anthem ""Gimmie Shelter"" which could be one of The Stones best pure rock singles since ""Satisfaction"". ""Love In Vain"" is a favorite of mine and ""You Got The Silver"" really shines too. The album ends epicly with the smash hit ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" which is a far more better and real look on life than all the hippie love songs(not that thoese were bad or anything)."
5,It's never to late.,"Have your ever waited to long for something then when you get it you say to yourself, I could of had this 14 year ago? I feel stupid. Great R&B. Without a doubt this is the strongest Stones ablum released. ""Midnight Rambler"" and ""Gimmie Shelter"" have shades of Zepplin. Great for Heads."
1,Worthless Stones/ ABKCO re-master for the 21st Century,"The DSD Copyright protection scheme means no play on the computer, so no adding to ITunes Playlist.These ABCKO people must still be high from the 60's. My disc was also defective on the standard CD player, jumping and skipping ( in a copyright protected digitally re-mastered sort of way) This version of the ROLLING STONES LET IT BLEED disc SUXIT."
4,Not Picasso,"To compare the Stones to the Beatles is like comparing Picasso to Warhol. Actually, I'm giving the Stones too much credit, because Warhol actually was quite creative. The Stones, while a great white blues band, were never as creative as their counterparts from Liverpool, and didn't create the interesting sounds and varied music that the moptops did. Moreover, after Exile on Main Street, the songs recycled and became very tedious and boring.That said, Let It Bleed is excellent. It's my favorite Stones recording, with some great tracks on it. I would hesitate to call it ""classic,"" though it is very good. It's no work of art like Pepper, Abbey Road, Revolver and Rubber Soul."
4,"Stones do good, have done better.","I enjoy this album and as a whole it is a strong album. You cant always get what you want is an all time favorite of mine and the rest of the tracks stand up and are very good. Its a bit on the short side. Overall if you like the stones this is the 3rd album of theirs you should get. Exile on Main Street and Sticky Fingers are better overall. Exile on Main Street is one of the best albums of all time in fact. SO after that, buy this!"
5,One of the best rock albums of all time,"Let It Bleed is one of, if not THE, greatest album from one of, if not THE greatest rock and roll band of all time. If you don't have Let It Bleed, you need it. It's beyond a must have; it's essential listening. It's music history. Standout tracks: Gimme Shelter, Country Honk, Live With Me, Let It Bleed, Midnight Rambler, Monkey Man, You Can't Always Get What You Want."
5,OH MY GOD! MAYBE THIS IS THERE BEST ALBUM? ANOTHER MASTERPIECE!,"Wow! What a line up! As soon as you hear the opening guitar of Gimme Shelter you know your in for something special! I love ""Country Honk"" How many groups have that kind of balls to not include a classic hit like ""Honky Tonk Woman"" and do a country version of that song for the album? Most groups could only dream of having enough great material to do something like that! The Stones were at the top of the game between ""Beggar's"" & ""Exile"". They managed to put out four of the greatest albums of all time, a fantastic live album(Ya Ya's) and an incredible hits set with Hot Rocks! This is an album that should be in every music lovers collection!"
4,"Very good music, very bad booklet","this new version of the Rolling Stones back catalog is a great improvement in terms of sound quality, but nohting more thatn that. In the booklet, there aren't any notes, not even band line-up, no lyrics, nothing. It's a shame."
5,best stones album,"Mick's performance on Monkey Man (and spectacular intro) was never to be repeated live, as his voice soares into unknown skies. THE album's absolute gem has to be Keith Richard's You Got the Silver, which has to be one of the most amazingly touching and sensitive track he ever worked on, and where his voice is near to breaking and shattering as soon as he reaches the end note. Note that this is the last album including Brian Jones, who makes his last ""performance"" on a couple of tracks, including ""You got the silver"" and ""Midnight Rambler"". ""Love in Vain"" will persuade anyone into adoring blues music. Beautiful stuff. The album of a new phase in the Rolling Stones' history. A definite must in any record collection."
1,Snake oil.,"Any positive reviews of this are either placebo effect, or fake (feel free to down vote my opinion - doesn't matter to me). I took 4 per day, 1 with each meal. I'm a male, 6'1"", athletic build, 180lbs, go to the gym 3 days per week. Was just looking to get rid of a little bit of fat covering my lower abs so I can see those muscles. Didn't lose a pound...and haven't gained a pound now that I'm 3 weeks outside of finishing the bottle. Waste of money. Don't bother with this."
1,Did not use,"I do not know if the product is effective or not because I did not use it. When I ordered, I was not careful to make sure that the capsules were vegetarian and they weren't. As for Natrol products in general, they have always proven effective for me."
1,Poor video quality.,"I think this DVD was mastered from a television broadcast. The video quality is very bad, and ""R"" rated words are omitted from the audio portion. Not bleeped, there's just a ""moment of silence"" when a character in the film curses. The picture of Mitchum on the cover was taken at least 20 years before the film was made."
2,Buyer beware,"I didn't mind the story itself. It's an older film and looks it. To explain the background of this would be giving the major plot away so I won't go there but it did have some fine actors in it. However, be wary of the quality of this film. The sound track was hideously overdriven and so distorted in places as to make it unpleasant. Amazon was kind enough to send another copy assuming it was just that one DVD disc and it was every bit as bad as the first one. Clearly the DVD vendor didn't do a good job transferring this from VHS to DVD. I don't know which suppliers are producing poor quality copies and which aren't so you are taking a chance. If you want it, be forewarned."
2,"Not a step up, but sideways","I got this for my Shindaiwa at work. I have some heavy brush to clear too, but that's what the chain saw is for. I have lots of light cane and young roses coming up too, thought this would get the job done.Nope. If heavy .105 or .120 line won't cut it, this probably won't either. And that's what you're trying to do, find a step up from the heavy line, isn't it? Set the mower deck high or find an actual blade to go on the end of your trimmer, because this thing isn't up to the challenge.If you don't want to ever replace trimmer line again, this might be what you need, but don't be lulled into thinking you've got something that's more capable than what you had."
3,I came up with a better solution,"I've used these for years, but they wear out quickly.I came up with a quick solution by getting three 1/16"" steel automotive starter shims, cut off the protruding finger gripping tips and insert them in place ofthe plastic Grass Gator Blades. The shims already have a hole just like the Gator Blades do. Insert the pivot pin through it.Make sure the shims are trimmed to the proper length or leave them if you have the clearance.Now you have heavy duty steel cutting blades that will take off your toes if you don't wear steel toe boots. Best to wear a safety shield as well.They are much cheaper than the Gator Blades and last a lot longer."
3,Misleading title,"This is a well-written book and the English translation is excellent. But it needs to be said that this is a history of Egyptian pharaohs with a particular emphasis on power struggles and building projects. The pharaonic succession is recounted in detail, and the layout of several temples and monuments is presented in the text and the figures.Other aspects of ancient Egyptian society, such as the organisation of the economy, administration, law, the military, the hieroglyphs or religious beliefs and worldviews are not even mentioned in this book. All topics involving the ordinary people of Egypt have been ignored.As a result, this book takes a very narrow look at ancient Egypt when it focuses exlusively on dynastic politics and archeological monuments. There's nothing wrong with that, but in my opinion a more suitable title for this book would have been 'A history of Egyptian pharaohs and their buildings'"
3,Very concise and matter-of fact style writing,This text goes into previously unknown and unwritten detail concerning the history of Egypt. I particularly enjoyed the chronological progression and the minute attention to detailed facts about the various pharaohs. The information regarding the Candaces of Meroe(Sudan) in relationship to Egypt was informative. The final phase of Egyptian history is well written in easy to understand.
5,"Detailed and scholarly, yet accessable","Seeking a solid overview of Ancient Egyptian history, I chose this book on the strong recommendations of Amazon readers. I was not disappointed. While the book is a bit dated (the English edition came out in 1992), it was more than adequte. Grimal presents a detailed history of Egypt from predynastic times through the conquest of Alexander, focusing on relgion, economics and society as well as political history.The chapters on the Old and New Kingdom were particularly strong - the interrelationship of politics and religion were very clearly written. The chaptes on the first and second intermediate periods and the Middle Kingdom were more diffucult for me to follow, although that may be more a function of my lack of familiarity than the fault of the author. All in all, an excellent introduction, certainly accessable for the lay reader."
4,Narrative style that provides concise data,"Very readable narrative-style book. The prose is reasonably easy to follow (though at times, a bit dry) but it provides a great overview. Helpful appendices also assist in giving clarity to the subject. The best book of its kind in relation to introductory Egyptology."
4,Great book on the ancient Egyptians,"If you are involved in the study of ancient Egypt or you just want to know more about the Pharaos, this is the book to go for!"
5,My first mic ever...,"Decided to buy this some weeks ago, after some research on which mic to start my recordings. Came REALLY fast for being international shipping. After a couple of try outs with some hardware and a mixer, decided to buy an audio interface which was not as cheap as the mic, but the quality is worth it. I'm new on this feild so I can't deny it's been kinda tricky to record something nice, but it has a good clear quality, captures the voice really good. I'd totally recommend this mic to EVERYBODY, easy to use, easy to record, perfect price for starters and you get a good recording done. Ignore the bad reviews, this mic is worth it."
5,Best microphone I've used.,"I'm not too experienced in the field of music creation, but I mainly use the Audix i5, I've used the Shure Sm57... As well as some vocal mics. I know they're not condenser mics... But its quite a difference. The microphone has given me absolutely NO noise yet, and it captures everything....HOWEVER! If this is one of your first microphones!!!! do know you will have to buy a separate 48V Phantom Power Supply!!! It's cheap... It's only about $20-$30, and it's VERY worth it."
4,MXL 770 Cardioid Condenser Mic,Great mic for a reasonable price. Sleek design and complete with hard shell case and mic mount. Mic is so sensitive.
4,lacking cord,MXL 770 Cardiod Condenser MicrophoneWe haven't been able to use it yet as it didn't come with a $3 cord.
2,"Written ""with no malice or rancor"" - Really??","The author states, as he clearly realizes he almost has to, in his ""author's note"" that he was first considered to write an authorized biography which was then not followed through on - a not infrequent occurrence. And having said that he goes on to say that he, that background notwithstanding, then wrote this unauthorized biography ""with no malice or rancor."" Really?? R-E-A-L-L-Y?? I lost count of the both malicious and ranorous, not to mention clearly speculative, ""statements"" this book is rife with. Yet, he wishes the reader coming upon one example after another of both ""malice"" and ""rancor"" to somehow believe that he wrote it with neither? Oh, puhleeze!!!"
2,"Defines the word ""Opportunist""","Juicy gossip about a woman who used marriages & alliances with powerful men & women to her advantage. For some reason her scandalous background didn't hamper her in finding an important diplomatic position. Her life until Harriman's death is fairly interesting, but I lost interest toward the end when the focus of the book became very political."
4,Fantastic Page-Turner,"Ogden's book is a delight to read. Fun, informative, and written with a great sense of detail and style, Life of the Party is an easy book to recommend. Harriman is a remarkable woman. I look forward to Ogden's next book."
1,What was the big deal?,"She slept her way to riches, fame and power. She did her best to break up marriages and she trampled over children's inheritances and was a neglectful mother to her own child. She bought herself an ambassador's position and traveled the world and lived in style often on the taxpayer's dime. What was so wonderful about this woman? That she could decorate a house, host a party and keep her man du jour happy? I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't pay for it. She was chiefly....a word that rhymes with mutt."
4,the CUTEST little bugger,"This thing even has a back shield for forward light for book reading and close use . Liting is slightly weak outdoors , yet for close quarters is more than enough and when dark should provide plenty of lite for trips to the ""privy"".Tiny thing is flashlite size and more useable . Cant ""drop kick"" it but it is rugged . Sure it could be improved , but then the sweet cost would be too high . We're developing a lantern collection simply for our multiple yearly power outages .Glad we have this light and will most likely be purchasing another ."
5,Nice piece for a BOB or Car kit.,"This is an excellent little lantern. I bought it for my emergency car kit. Tested it, nice and bright. It is very compact and lightweight so I'll be ordering a second one for my BOB. It comes with 3 AA batteries that I will replace with better quality batteries. I keep my EDC and BOB lights to AA or AAA batteries as extras are light weight and I don't have to carry a bunch of different size batteried in my bags. A nice piece of kit. If anyone has rigged up a sheath or storage case for it, I love some ideas on how you managed it."
5,compact but bright,This is the second of these I have purchased. Even though it is small in size it gives off a lot of light. I have two of them now for when the power goes out. We really like these and recommend them highly.
4,Small but bright,"Quite small (do pay attention to the listed dimensions) but gives off a nice bright light. I'll be glad to have it next time it storms, I'm sure."
4,"practical, functional lamp","No need to go into great detail here, as the other reviewers have managed to describe this item adequately. My experience with this lantern can be described thusly: it's about the size of a can of beer, is lightweight, casts enough light to read by, and it doesn't feel like it will fall apart at the first stiff gust of wind it encounters. It definitely will not survive being immersed in water. The reflector is pretty much a joke. If you live in hurricane country or in any other place that could conceivably be subject to long power outages, then a low-output LED lamp like this one, with its absurdly long battery life, can provide a safe substitute for candles.EDIT: It took two years to wear out the first set of batteries, and I've found that the switch is not entirely reliable (fails every fourth or fifth time its turned on.)"
3,Not very bright,"This lantern doesn't give out as much light as other LED lanterns. The Coleman 3AA MicroPacker LED Lantern is a better choice because it has a much brighter LED that can fill a decent sized room with light. Since it's the same size as this one, it doesn't take up any more space for campers. This compact lantern is okay for the small confines of a tent, but it's not the best choice for an emergency home light."
2,Not a great light source,"I have a Coleman Personal Lantern and it is light years above this product in terms of quality. For the extra few bucks, I highly recommend you go with the more robust light source of the personal lantern as opposed to this micropacker. I have tiny pen flashlights that were of more use than this thing on my camping trips. It's not a good lantern and it's not a useful flashlight, so that basically makes it a useless product unless in the event of an emergency. I keep it around just in case, but I will never use it unless it's the only thing I can find."
5,Great smaller size lantern,"I purchased a few of these in the wake of hurricane Irene - haven't had power for a week.They are lightweight and easy to use, and run a very long time on 3 AA batteries. At 4-6 hours a day, you easily get a few weeks on standard batteries...possibly a month on lithium cells. Unlike standard flashlights, the beam spreads out to fill large spaces with enough light to see your way around. Better quality than I expected at this price - definitely recommended."
4,The Light of your Night,I received this little light yesterday and started sing it in my Atrium which it lite up no problem with enough light to utilize my laptop which I felt was more than adequate for any camp site.Don't know how ong the batteries will last however it's definitely plenty bright.And as with all Amazon purchases shipping and delivery was fast as can be. Especially if it is Amazon who distributes it. Kudos to the Amazon team!! :-)
3,"Long-lasting, but really dim","Obviously there's no miracle equation between long battery life and greater brightness, but this product really leans toward the long-life end of the spectrum (other reviews suggest it'll go for 24h on 3 AAs).Speaking of which, the 3 included AAs are GP brand which I've used before and fine to be great quality. I haven't put our lantern through the paces yet (haven't gone camping - not geeky enough to do tests just for kicks at home) but it's really not that bright. Don't think you can read a book or play cards by it comfortably, I really see it as more like a help to sift through camping gear in an otherwise dark tent, but even after your eyes adjust to the relative dimness, it's really not that bright, and the rear 'flood' mode shutter makes little discernible difference. Much better than a dark tent, but not really what I was looking for."
3,Smaller than I thought,This is a nice little light...but much smaller than I expected. It lights up quite well...but since I was looking for something that shed a little more light....I was a little disappointed. Still it works well and sheds enough light to see by.
5,it's okay,I had higher expectations of this light which was my own fault. I was hoping to save some money and use it as a lantern around the camp site but this wasn't made for that. This is a perfect tent lamp or light to be used indoors. I actually keep it by my bedside and use it when i get up a night. It will light up the entire room while gentle on the eyes. I also use it camping but only in my tent.Not great outside but in a tent or indoors it's great.
2,Not very powerful.,I bought three of these in advance of Sandy. When they arrived I found that the brightness was no where what I had hoped for..
4,A Great Little Light,"I bought this light after noticing during my hurricane prep that one of my previous electric lanterns was not working. I picked this one up because of its advertised use of LED bulbs, and the fact that it uses AA batteries. It is very bright light, and comes with included batteries, not alkaline batteries, which was surprising, and its small size makes it more wieldy than my previous lanterns, so I am very happy with it."
2,Don't throw away your money on this toy,"It's just a toy.. worth a $1 at the dollar store.. no more no less.. it is as advertised, but it is only a toy. I thought it would be nice for my regular power outages in central America, it provides just enough light to keep you from banging your toes in the dark. My cigarette lighters / led keychain flashlights put out more dependable light and you can put them in pocket. I liked the big Coleman rechargeable fluorescent unit a bunch. Nothing can replace a good old gas lantern, but just remember this is a toy only.Charlie"
4,compact and bright,I use this for my kids to carry around and to keep in their rooms when we have blackouts.MUCH safer than using a candle. Great on battery life. I bought three of these foremergencies.
1,"If you enjoy blinding light in your eyes, you'll love this","The purpose of this light seems to be to blast light in the eyes of anyone approaching it from any angle -- not surprising from a company known for it's infamous and blinding Coleman lantern. You might think from its design that it slides together for a more compact package, but that's where the batteries go and there's no sliding to be had. For two LED's it doesn't seem to put out much light. The LED's are inside the standard cylinder of textured plastic which diffuses the light somewhat but also blasts out bits of hard light. It's OK for a suspended tent light, but I wouldn't set it on a table to read or to eat dinner. For a truly intelligently designed lamp by people who understand light, see Dorcy's 4 LED 41-1017."
1,"Got rained on, stopped working","I bought this one based on the amazon reviews; this is the one time they failed me. Light worked fine until we got it into some rain. It kind of glowed for a little while. Tried it again at night and *nothing*. I figure since it's Coleman, and it's for outdoor use, it should keep working no matter how much rain it sees. It's in the bin now."
2,Meh,"Not nearly as bright as the other reviews would indicate.You can read by this lantern if your book is within 2-3 feet of the lantern. You can see to cook out-doors at about the same distance. For such limited distances, it really doesn't have much to recommend it over a headlamp.The price is good and they would make decent candle replacements for when the power goes out, but I wouldn't want to rely on them to light a campsite."
1,Not very bright,"Even for a mini lantern, I was disappointed with the light output of this item. It turns out it only has an output of 15 lumens. For $2 more I found another Coleman mini lantern that has an output of 90 lumens."
4,"For the price, a decent lamp.","This lantern is compact and the triangle shape fits neatly and comfortably into your hand. The batteries at the bottom provide a enough weight at the base to keep the lantern steady. The hook at the top is a little cheesy, and I'm not confident that it will hold up over the long term, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. The lamp puts out a decent amount of bright white light, and will easily illuminate a tent. For the price, you're getting a good product."
3,This is a nice little light for camping. Not for reading.,"It outputs a odd color white which is not good for reading. That is my only gripe. But for lighting up a tent it does a ok job. A little dim but decent,"
3,Does it's job but not brite enough.,A good camping item but not bright enough to read by and not really good for much else. We made though.
3,good inside tent light,This is just bright enough to hang inside your tent or in an enclosed area. With this there is no need to put a magnet on your rainfly which will cause it to tear.
5,Very bright.,This little light is very bright for such a small light. I really like the feature of being able to direct the light. This was a great purchase for the price.
2,Little lite,"You get what you pay for. A good little lite, but not able to lite more then a small area. I use it in small cramped areas and it is fine, but don't expect to get a great deal of lite from it though. You will need a larger unit for this."
3,neatlite,"Nice little, well made light. Switch seems a bit hard to operate. About what I expected overall."
3,Nice light but wIshed it was more compact,This flashlight does the job but it would have been an added feature if it collapsed into a smaller more portable flashlight.
2,"Lights up, but doesn't provide light.","First, this is a really tiny light much smaller than I expected, but that was ok since I was taking it on a camping trip. I bought it to provide light inside the tent, but it doesn't illuminate anything. I was in a 3 person tent and we couldn't see what was inside our bags without putting the lantern inside of it, or the floor of the tent, or our sleeping bags, etc. I'm not really sure what purpose this lantern has since it doesn't shine like a flash light or illuminate it's surroundings. Maybe in another environment it will work differently, but I'm not sure what that would be."
5,Get one for every occupied bedroom,I happened to buy this light for a tent light for camping. A storm shut down our power during the night and I didn't want to awaken my elderly mom so I put this light in her bathroom and turned it on. Great light and I didn't worry about the batteries draining and it gave off a LOT of light (in a white bathroom)! Everyone should have one of these for their bedroom. 125 hours is a long time and the unit-sturdiness and peace of mind was well worth the $12 price. You won't be sorry.
4,Good little lantern,"The light isn't blindingly bright, but it is pretty bright considering the tiny size. The lamp seems sturdy enough, and the small size makes it easy to store for emergencies. I could barely see any difference with the rear reflector up or down, so I just leave it down."
3,Great product,"Good quality, compact and sleek design. Value for money. It does not provide bright lighting. Its quite faint. It can fairly light up a 10 feet * 10 feet room, but you cannot even read a book in this light if placed in one part of the room. Depends on how and where you use this product."
4,Small and handy,"This little light is great for camping, whether in the tent or the non-electric cabin. Cheap and small enough to pack two or more--one for every room in that cabin where you have to see your way around. It also seems to be waterproof, as we used it in the shower (in that dark cabin)."
5,Matures with listening.,"I was fortunate in finding this cd on Amazon Marketplace at a great price as it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain it in the U.K. On hearing this for the first time I was not quite sure about this latest and final release by Gerry Rafferty . I think it is fair to say that it is different from his earlier recordings, but the more I played it the better it got! If you are a Gerry Rafferty fan and get the chance to buy this increasingly rare release then stick with it like I did. You will be richly rewarded."
1,What the F**K is this?!!!! I give her 0 stars,"Que m**rda es eso! A pesar de que lo baje por kazaa, quiero devolucion de mi dinero. Is there a rating below 1 STAR, she definitely does not deserve one?"
5,Scorpion Finder,"We got this to hunt down the scorpions in our new house. The UV beam helps you spot them at quite long range (maybe 6-7ft). It's well built, does the job and was a great price."
2,Mot bright enough,"I have another black light, but this products has less light brightness than other.It won't show up scorpions when the distance is more than 6 feet, but other will show up.It is good idea with a regular weak flash light, but it would be better to have more power to the black light."
2,"Streamlight 51010 Twin-Task 3C 9-Inch UV Flashlight, Falls short","Was real excited getting this light for checking for scorpions around the home. However it falls way short of what I expected. The black light is not very bright, compared to some cheaper ones on the market. I figured with the 3 C cells this would really show nicely, I was wrong and a friends cheaper one works a lot better and you can stand back further and see with it. I’d would not recommend this light based on our experience."
2,Stream light 51010 gives off very litte light.,"This flashlight does not work for me. It does give off sufficient lumina. During the day, you can barely see use the UV light.Vincent"
3,Not what I was hoping for,"When I decided to pay $44 for a UV flash light I was hoping to get something that was brighter and more powerful than the small cheap UV lights you see at your local drug storeThis product does what it says in that there are three settings and two different UV levels - however it is not even half as bright as the $6 UV mini-light that I bought at Walgreens last week - so - I guess it is an Ok product if you are just looking for low level UV and longer battery life due to the 3x C-cells, but if you are searching for a brighter, high powered UV flashlight then keep shopping"
1,Does not work,I received this item on time and found out that the xenon light settings does not work.It is useless to deal with amazon when you buy items from other dealers.Be aware of the product description.You get what you pay for. PROBLEMS.
3,Quite pricey for quality of product,"Purchased this light after reading the reviews and needing to track down scorpions. The light is very dim even on the higher setting in complete darkness and barely identifies scorpions. Regular light (3rd setting) is great and very bright.However, to track pet urine it is great and lit up every area where our puppy had a few accidents.Had previously purchased a ""Defiant"" UV light at Lowes for 9.95 that works just as well. Not sure I would highly recommend this light."
2,Not what I expected,"This flashlight seems to be a regular light first then as an afterthought a UV light. I bought it thinking the 3 C cell batteries would give the UV lights distance and clarity, but all you get is a flashlight that is too heavy to use regularly. Sure, the single beam flashlight works great, is rugged, and it's easy to switch between bright single light and UV 3 or 6 light but the UV light is weak compared to my other much smaller UV light. You can buy a UV light for $15, and you can buy a flash light for $10, no reason to spend $40 for a subpar UV light-flashlight."
4,"Expensive, but it WORKS!","Bought this for scorpion hunting. Almost got the cheaper version that didn't have the 375nm. I think I would've been very disappointed in saving that $10. The 375nm is the only one I use--it is MUCH brighter and useful than the other (390nm), both for carpet stains and scorpions. And having the bright white xenon option makes it very versatile when I encounter something I just want to light up. It's an awesome flashlight, well-made. I really needed it, so I don't regret spending the money, but I still think it's overpriced."
4,Works great... very pleased!,"I bought this product because my cats have unfortunately thrown up and had bathroom mishaps around our house over the passed year. My husband and I are doing everything we can to keep our house as clean as possible while having pets.After reading multiple reviews for other black lights available on amazon, this is the product I settled on. I had no desire to waste my money on a cheap black light, and this was within my budget.What else can I say? It does the job! Close the drapes, turn off the lights, and turn on the black light. If your drapes aren't thick enough, you may want to use it in the evenings once it is dark out (darkness is the key with black lights obviously). I found spots I would have never seen with the naked eye. I like that is has a heavy duty feel as well, and that it has 3 settings. I use the brightest black light setting for finding soils, and the LED white light is super bright as well! Definitely pleased."
1,bad quality,"Follow up: I now own 3 of them and all 3 have some burned out LEDsI was surprized at how well built this flashlight is. The frequency of UV light is perfect for detecting leaks in cooling systems for both automotive and residential applications. It also works well for amature forensic purposes, and scorpions will appear luminescent. The xenon bulb is very nice but not the brightest light you can find and you have to depress the switch three times to use the xenon bulb. I am very pleased with my purchase, but it is overpriced. If you are not buying this light mostly for the UV purposes then you probably want something else. UPDATE: I have had it for over a year now and one of the Led lights on the module is burned out, keep this in mind when buying."
2,STREAMLIGHT UV MODE,"WHITE LIGHT OPERATION IS GREAT BUT IF YOU NEED THE UV MODE, IS WEAK AND NOT VERY GOOD AND OR BRIGHT, with the name as streamlight product, this is a piece of junk for the money..not worth it."
2,3C 9-inch UV Flashlight,"For about $50, not the best. Some of the reviews I looked at before buying this product were misleading. Better to buy the 41 LED Professional UV Inspection Flashlight 395-400nm Ultraviolet Spectrum for a lesser cost of about $15 and better brightness. I tracked scorpions better with that."
3,Perfect for Sea Glass UV Identification,"I collect sea glass and got this to look for UV glass. I was hoping to be able to take this down to the beach and look at night, but it is not strong enough, although in the house it shows up just fine to at least identify it. Worth the price."
4,UV lighst worked great!,"This was a great light to carry around. It had bulky size and feel to it which I loved. Almost like carrying a baton!! The only down fall was the normal light. It had a very odd pattern, but still better than not having a flashlight."
5,Awesome,"Got for my husband and he loves it. The light is more than just a black light, it can function as a flash light too. He is very pleased with his new toy."
4,Great light if you have indoor pets.,"Picks up urine stains very well in both UV spectrums, the 375 NM does a much better job at finding those puddles in carpet and tile. It has to be used at night withe lights off but it does a great job. The plain white light is a major plus as I did not want to buy a flashlight that only saw ""pee"". It is rugged and well made, bright enough for general purpose use and wherever else you would need a UV light."
4,"Great light, can't change bulb though.","I've had this light for several years now. Extremely bright with xenon bulb, however it needs to be changed now, it's getting dim. Can't figure out how to change bulb nor can I get Streamlight to tell me how. The UV light is great for spotting scorpions at my house in Arizona."
2,UV very weak light,"Tested the UV (both) even in total darkness, and never could get any flourescent indication on various biologicals. About only thing I could see is hidden printing on some money. The natural light flashlight is just so so. Would not recommend this for serious UV use."
3,quality disc for Bassey fans,"This is a re-packaged version of Shirley Bassey's 1984 album ""I Am What I Am"" (aka ""The Great Shirley Bassey""). For some reason or another it managed to fall through the cracks only to get quietly reissued on the budget Goldies label.Recorded with a particularly lush London Symphony Orchestra--under the direction of Carl Davis--Miss Bassey revisits the tunes which helped cement her stardom. Featured among the hits are the usual suspects like ""Big Spender"" (from SWEET CHARITY), ""As Long As He Needs Me"" (OLIVER!), ""I Am What I Am"" (LA CAGE AUX FOLLES), ""Send in the Clowns"" (A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC), ""Never, Never Never"", and ""This is My Life"".A quality disc for Bassey fans. [GOLDIES GLD-63133]"
1,Grass Gator Garbage,"This thing is a huge disappointment. While the attachment process went ok, everything was downhill from there.My trimmer would stall whenever I got this thing into some thick grass. Occurred multiple times in the first 10 min. of use.Then the first plastic tooth broke off. C'mon ... my string lasts longer along a chainlink fence!!!! This thing went into the trash and I'll live with the string hassles.Buyer beware."
1,Don't buy this unless,"I purchased this at the same time I got a new Black & Decker line trimmer. I was very excited to get this attachement on & not have to worry about the hassles of line anymore! I have your typical backyard with tall grass growing along the side of the house, fence & a block wall. Once I got the right product for my trimmer it was very easy to snap on. This product works great if all you are doing is trimming grass & weeds with nothing solid like rocks or walls that might be in the way. Unfortunatley as I was cutting through high grass I kept coming accross hidden rocks & everytime I hit one, either a blade would break off or the whole unit which is snapped on would come off. After this happened about 5 times I am beginning to wonder if I shouldn't just just the original line setup it came with or explore something else."
4,Grass Gator 3600,Grass Gator 3600 Light Duty Bladed Trimmer Replacement head works as advertised; beats the heck out of the string trimmer head.
2,Not quite what I was looking for.,"The Grass Gator was supposed to be the solution to my ""always having to refill my line"" problem. As it turns out, the blades dulled pretty quickly. It could be that the Grass Gator is made just for hittin' weeds in an open space. I was edging along my house and gardens. Anyhow, I'm not ready to say it's a bad product, but it certainly didn't do what I was hoping it would. I recommend you only buy it if you won't have it near anything that could dull the blades."
5,Good stuff!,"Would recommend this to anyone. I mix in 8 oz milk, 1 tbsp peanut butter, and some ice and the shake tastes like a butterfinger."
2,Disappointing,"I have recently become very interested in these songs (songs from my youth.) I had about 1/3 of this album on mp3 files and wanted the other songs available here.Much to my disappointment, this album does not sound very good. While completely listenable, it sounds muddy and veiled. When comparing the same track back-to-back with my mp3 files, my older files always sounded clearer with better defined bass. This was true even though the mp3 files had a lower bit rate!I am crushed, because I had hoped to obtain a ""definitive"" recording of these great songs. I guess I'll keep looking.This album does not sound awful, and I will listen to it in my car where the differences may not be as noticeable. If you're looking for a ""great"" recording of these songs, I advise that you keep looking."
2,Poor audio quality ruins great music,"I LOVE Dionne Warwick. Imagine my disappointment when I played this CD and from the opening track heard hiss and noise. Then on track two, ""What the World Needs Now,"" there's so much distortion it makes the gorgeous song essentially unlistenable. And so on through the album. I'm going to recycle the disc through a used CD store, and get a different collection with better sound. Sorry, I don't yet know which one might be the best -- but it isn't this one."
4,"a total girly night enhancer (nails, facial & aroma-therapy)","Dionne's voice is strong, sometimes so strong there's a slight distortion. Volume levels vary from song to song but it's not irritating. the order the songs are in tells a beautiful story of life, love, heartbreak, and hope."
3,Decent but flawed.,"When you get an ""import"" you're never, ever quite sure of the support the disk has been given by the record companies holding the original master tapes. With Rhino compilations you can basically be assured that the best source material available has been used, with foreign imports you never ever know. The use of dubious source material is what holds this album back. I have 4 different CD versions of most of these songs available to me and I can truly tell the difference with this disk. I won't go so far to say that Dionne's vocal tracks were ripped and placed on inferior backing tracks, but I do think that some of the tracks on here are copies of copies and, as a result, sound washed out and flat. Still there are some gems on here that make the disk worth buying. I primarily bought this disk because it saves me the trouble of making a single disk of the Bacharach & David compositions. Buy it with that in mind and you'll be well served.Da Worfster"
5,Wonderful story for Christmastime or anytime,"This is a fabulous book that brings to mind the wonder of Christmas through a child's eyes. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is timeless and unforgettable! I read this story to my children, ages 11, 8, and 4, each year around Christmas. I even read it to my MOPS group as a Christmas reading last year. Thank you, Max Lucado, for another wonderful children's book!"
4,Angels & Christmas--an unbeatable combination!,Very cute story about a little boy whose Christmas Tree angel comes to life to sing sweet songs to him. Gorgeous artwork brings the story to life with brilliance. I loved that the story repeated itself once the little boy grew up and had a son of his own who hears the angels music.
3,Torn after 7 months,We had this mat for less than 8 months when it split from one end to the other. I called to return/replace it and was told that they are only expected to last one school year! I'm surprised that an item this expensive doesn't have a longer life expectancy. I'm still waiting for the email/call indicating that this item will be replaced. I understand this is not Amazon's fault.
2,Not as advertised,"This would have been a great mat if the actual size of it was what was advertized. The product received measures 2x19x44, 5 inches narrower and 4 inches shorter than expected. I ordered it for my kindergartener, for nap time, and despite being 25th percentile in height, she will be falling off it. At least the thickness is adequate. I feel like I threw money away (though it doesn't seem there are any quality nap mats out there) and would not recommend this unless your child is skinny and less than 44 inches tall. Note: even though the plastic bag it came in says 2x19x44 all over it, there is a labeling sticker from the company that says 2x24x48 - it would seem they are confused."
5,Southern California Flora,"I have found this to be the most useful wildflower book for coastal southern California. It serves me well from Ensenada, in Baja California to Nojoqui Falls, in Santa Barbara county.This book has been my field guide, and notebook/palimpsest since 1995.Other books I have, but don't rate 5 stars: Peterson's Pacific States Wildflowers; Coffeen's Central Coast Wildflowers; Audubon's Field Guide to North American Wildflowers -- Western Region."
3,Great Performer -- Poor transfer to CD,I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer: Rusty Warren was a great performer; w-a-y ahead of her time. Using only innuendo and double-entendre -- and not a word you couldn't say on radio or TV back then -- she still managed to convey sexual ideas that got her banned from the air-waves and many conservative communities. Almost ironic: explicit without expletives.These wonderful performances did not deserve such shabby treatment from whoever transferred them from vinyl to CD. Muddied sound and the tracks all run together.Buy it for the nostalgia -- but don't expect much in the way of sound quality.
1,Mild ripoff,This is a very short CD -- obviously recorded at a club. The audio quality is not very good. That could be forgiven if the CD were packed with several live shows. Excerpts from two shows is not enough.Additionally there is NO information booklet so I have no idea where and when these sets were recorded.Look for a better collection of Rusty's remarkable performances.
3,"An effective workout tool, with a couple of drawbacks.","The utility of this item should be obvious to anyone contemplating it's purchase. For those who haven't examined one, these observations. The handgrips may not provide enough space for your fingers. The fingers of my moderately large hands feel uncomfortably crowded when using the ball, perhaps to the point of being harmful with long term use. The ball is much firmer than the other medicine balls I have used. With gripless models you generally do not have to worry about dropping the ball on yourself or bumping it into your head. You won't want to do either with this one. Finally, this ball smells like a new tire. If you enjoy sniffing new tires you will enjoy this ball for a long time, for the smell does not appear anxious to fade way. That said, I have used this product to good effect."
2,Everlast Medicine ball review,"The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched. It also had a flat spot on it. I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition. Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before. I would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it. We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome. Definitly not happy with it."
1,Huge Disppointment,The medicine ball came in flat and dirty. Box was torn. I returned it and it ended up costing me shipping charges as Amazon would cover their rate of shipping costs so I had to pay the differences.
1,I agree with some of the other criticisms,"I ordered one of these and it arrived all scuffed and scratched. It also had deflated somewhat (and had the same flat spot some other people mentioned), and the box was all torn up, and the handle openings were way too small for even your fingertips to fit into! (I don't have large hands at all). Apparently, nobody is checking the quality of these balls before they get sent out - I bet I ordered the same exact defective balls some other people returned!I strongly recommend either getting a medicine ball without handles or going with a different brand than Everlast if you want the handles. I haven't actually seen one of these in person, but the picture of the one at naturalfitnessinc.com seems to have much better hand openings. (I'm not affiliated with them in any way, just judging what I see on their website)."

1,Don't buy any Movado watch,If you try and get a battery it must be sent back to them at a cost of $ 35.00 plus Fed Ex or UPS and $ 15.00 service fee. The battery luckily last about 1 year. Then plan on them telling you your band and case needs work. Their estimate for a $ 450.00 watch was $ 347.45 not including shipping charges back to me. Please do not let them rip you off!
2,Very bad experience with this Movado watch.,"This is a very nice watch, but there seems to be some inherent problem with the band. After being used for 2 weeks, the band fell off the watch face for no reason. Amazon gave me an exchanged new watch after that, but unfortunately the same thing happened again after less than a month of using the 2nd watch. It's really an unhappy experience with the same problem, especially when you purchase this watch as a birthday gift for your dearest one! I hope Movado has noticed this problem and made some improvement. Anyway, the style of the watch is still very attractive."
4,Beautiful and durable,"At 23, I haven't had a vast experience with flatware; no weddings full of choices about what to return and what to keep, no decades of watching flatware got through tends. But as someone who spends a great deal of time in the kitchen and with a constant stream of guests, I can say that this flatware is not only beautiful but durable and functional. While it could be slightly sturdier (ice cream frozen particularly hard will make the serving spoon bend slightly), I have gotten repeated compliments on the style and handling of the flatware and other than that slight serving spoon bend, it has held up beautifully through all sorts of different dishes. The forks in particular are worth mentioning, in that they are definetly high quality enough for those of us to tend to cut our meat with the fork edge instead of a knife; I've have no problem with any flexing or bending in that regard."
2,you get what you pay for,maybe its because i got a set made in vietnam but the quality on these are horrible. i barely used them and they lost their shine almost after the first 2 uses. they also get skuffed very easily and so you see lines going everywhere. ive used other oneida products but the set I got here seemed to be of much much lower quality. only get it if you are looking for something cheap.
4,Oneida Flight Flatware Set,This is a good quality set and works very well for every day. I also bought a set for my daughter since it was priced so well. I prefer to use a set with a more elaborate design with my china.
5,great value,"ordered this item from amazon after checking many web sites, the cost of the product along with free shipping saved me anywhere from $20.00 to more than $40.00. I'm surprised that it arrived 2 days after ordering without having to pay extra. it's a really great place to find great values."
2,Beware of the quality.,"I bought the Oneida Flight pattern 2.5 years ago when I graduated from college - Loved the pattern, loved the weight, loved the quality. This year, I wanted to add more place settings (I only got a service for 8 the first time), so I ordered this set thinking that it would add to my current set. Unfortunately, in the last two years, Oneida has changed the manufacturer. Instead of the heavy, made in the USA set that you could purchase two years ago, Oneida is selling a similar looking lighter, made in Vietnam set. It's noticeably less good - The knives are much lighter and handles are thinner, the forks are shorter, and the serving peoples seem ""cheap."" If you can get the older USA version (which by the way is the set pictured - the product that you'll receive is similar but not exact), I'd recommend it instead of this set. I found a few of the bigger chain stores that have a couple boxes of it left on the back of the shelves."
4,The Jam set the course...,"After two albums of motown-flavored punk, this is where Paul Weller starts to branch out a bit. Moving from Pete Townshend influenced songwriting, Weller finds influence in Ray Davies' storytelling. 'English Rose', 'Billy Hunt', and 'Down in the Tube Station at Midnight' show more of a cerebral tilt, as opposed to the petal to the metal songs from 'In the City' and 'This is the Modern World.' From 'All Mod Cons' on, the Jam begin to show the variety in song style that was equaled only by their contemporaries, the Clash."
5,Outstanding,"All Mod Cons is undeniably the best album released by The Jam. Some may argue that Setting Sons is, but in my mind All Mod Cons, sums up the essence of The Jam. Paul Weller's writing on this album was huge departure from the 2 albums released prior to it and this album clearly demonstrated the classic Jam sound. This is a 'must have' album for any fan of The Jam, or any Mod fan for that matter."
2,Prods instead of slices,"2 1/2This quintessential artsy-indie collective, boldly inventive as much as they are pretentiously shallow, debuted with more or less a slight pull in their favor, mixing a rag-tag assortment of crude but melodic electro-rock oddities into a stew which certainly does not taste bland, though hardly feels fully cooked ."
5,Weird and Wonderful,"Wow. 'Knife Play' is one of the most disturbing, depressing, and beautiful albums I've ever heard. Their sound is hard to describe, but their lead singer, Jaime Stewart, kind of sounds like Robert Smith. Musically, the band (two guys and two girls) use a multitude of instruments like synths, mandolins, drum beats, gongs, trumpets, and programming. The guitar work is excellent as well, particularly towards the end of 'Hives Hives' and 'Homonculus'. Lyrically, if you find anything darker, I don't think I'd like to hear it. Here's a snippet of their glorious song 'Suha': ""I hate my husband, I hate my children, I'm going to hang myself..."" Yikes. If you like your experimental pop down and dirty and are open minded to different musical art forms, 'Knife Play' will surprise you, shock you, scare the hell out of you, and maybe even comfort you."
3,An Alright Album,"This CD is alright. That's all I can say about it. I've had this CD 4 a long time now. It wasn't until I can across her ""Every Little Girl's Dream"" CD, that I got this 1 out & relistened 2 it. This CD needs 2 b n a different song order. The songs r okay. I think Capitol Records could of gave her better songs. If u buy this CD, buy it used. Don't waste the money 2 buy it new. It's not worth it."
2,Not a good copy of the movie,"Here's the deal, it is a bit choppy. I can handle black and white. That doesn't bother me. This, however, is a rough copy. It was cheap enough, but I'm afraid that in this case you get what you pay for. If you really want to see this film, see if there is another version somewhere."
2,A must miss!,"If you're looking for a typical left-wing ""revisionist"" account of US diplomatic history, then this book might appeal to you. Like too many pseudo-intellectuals, Williams has a preconceived notion of how the world works and then looks to support his theory with some facts, ignoring many others that would clearly contradict his view. He fails to offer a sophisticated analysis - not for the serious scholar."
5,"Created An ""Open Door"" To Exploring The True Nature Of Pax Americana","William Appleman Williams critique of Pax America was a brave intellectual opening on the heals of McCarthyism. One only needs to read the soft & measured tones of his sentences in Tragedy Of American Diplomacy to feel the anxieties he must have had...not knowing of the future consequences of his personal well being. As a student, I became aware of William Appleman Williams through Sidney Bell. Bell recieved his PHD from the University of Wisconsin. So many WAW proteges such as Gabriel Kolko which have refined WAW's work.As a student of History and seeker of truth, kudos to William Appleman Williams and the intellectual foundation he built."
1,Liberal myth-making's origins,"Williams is the father of the revisionist myth that everything that went wrong with the world in the 20th Century was the fault of the United States. There is no crime by the communists that is so heinous that it cannot be dismissed with a euphemism and no action by the United States so innocent that it cannot be twisted into a vicious act of imperialist greed. Given the fact that it was written in 1959 when much less was known about Stalin's and Lenin's crimes (although even the Soviets were starting to talk about it), some of his distortions could be excused. The fact that this work merits a ""fiftieth anniversary edition"" and is still lauded by the revisionists who refuse to admit their mistakes is not."
1,Don't look at this picture,"This picture is COMPLETELEY inaccurate. It looks like it would fit a bigger phone, but when you get it shipped, it is VERY small, and it is not shaped anything like it is in the picture. VERY Frustrating!!!"
4,good set,"while ""Juicy Fruit"" got all the Squeeze no pun intended this Album better showcases&Highlights the Depth of Mtume.the cool thing with there Music is that they don't Sound like everything else out at the time.this is a underated Album.James Mtume has done alot more for Music than many know."
5,SERCHING FOR MTUME YOU ME AND HE,"I HAVE BEEN SERCHING FOR THIS CD FOR 10 YEARS AND NOW THAT I FOUND IT MY COLLECTION IS ALMOST COMPLETE,ONE OF THE FINEST EARLY SOUL/JAZZFUNK ALBUMS EVER. A COMPLETE MUST FOR EVERY SOUL MUSIC LOVER.ENJOY."
5,"You, Me and He","I owned this on cassette back in the day. It was a frequent play. That got lost with frequent movement as I was in the military then. And now on a second marriage. So time went by and the cassette was lost. I loved the cassette and was mad happy to receive the cd. I straight reminisced, and jammed like the old days."
4,Fur Real Friends Tugging pup,My daughter asked for a puppy for christmas and was thrilled when she opened this. It barks and growls at her when she pulls on the rope. She also likes that she can put the pup to sleep and it snores. She likes to show people who come over her new puppy. Fun for both a three year old and an adult.
4,great,I got this for my now 3 yo for x-mas last year. she Loves dogs and this has been a great toy for almost a year now. She still plays with it and now my 1 yo little boy plays with it too.
2,sloppy seconds,"I'd love to read a book that lives up to the title of this one. The recent New Yorker anthologies of fiction, nonfiction, and humor come a lot closer. The Paris Review published the lesser work of major writers, and lately it has been mostly given over to the longueurs of lightweights like Rick Moody. Plimpton will go down in literary history as a negligible, starstruck, Robin Leach-like figure, a party boy of narrow taste and ken. His magazine has been irrelevant for at least two decades now."
5,order shipment and arrival condition,The item was received within the time specifications; and was received in excellent conidtion.
3,"Slightly dated, but good information","The book concentrates mostly on crosswing boomerangs and those built along the same lines. These are a lot of fun to make and fly but if you really want to get into the real thing (sport booms, not ""hunting"") there are better, more informative books available."
4,"A fun, do-it-yourself sport/hobby for all ages","Mason tells how to build and throw an assortment of throwing objects besides the boomerangs, built out of wood or cardboard. As well, he suggests forms of competitions and judging. He puts a big emphasis on safety -- boomerangs and throwing sticks were designed to bring down small game, or even enemy warriors, so they require care in use. This would be a great addition to the after-school or summer fun program of your park, club, or school. It's also fine to do by yourself during the hours the playground is empty."
1,not worth the money,does not suppress appetite or do anything else. this product is just another waste of money. save your funds for something else.
2,meh. buy something else.,"That's pretty much the last time i take a recommendation from Amazon sight unseen. We have a pretty regular ""game night"" around here, ages 22-30, and we have enjoyed quite a few games, both drinking and sober, and I'll say this: the vikings would be disappointed. We tried this game both while drinking and while sober, and both times it sort of stank. It's a large collection of poor sexual innuendo, simplistic interface, and unchallenging gameplay. You're supposed to secretly pick one of four products, then select one of several slogans to advertise that product, read it aloud, and the other players guess what you are advertising. Unless one or more of your players has had a partial/full lobotomy, there's not much challenge to it. We quit about 1/3 of the way through when drinking (and i got chastised for bringing such a lame game to the party) and when sober we decided after a few questions that we'd be better off with Pictionary. So there you go."
1,Caution - This is truly an ADULT game.,"After reading some very positive reviews about this game, I purchased a copy thinking it would be another great party game along the lines of Apples to Apples or Beyond Balderdash. Unfortunately, Fundex took the low road in using sex-related, double meaning, dirty, trashy humor on more than just a few of the product and ad slogan cards. When I sit down to play a board game with my family, I don't expect to be subjected to the same filth we too often find in other forms of entertainment. Sorry to rant, but if you are looking for something clean, look elsewhere."
4,Laughed til my sides hurt!,"This is a game for adults who can laugh at sexual innuendos...not that the game itself is sexually-explicit at all. But the game wouldn't be nearly as much fun if you take the topics seriously. Let your imagination roam and try to think of how the OTHER person will answer the question. No alcohol needed for this game to be a riot! Gameplay is super-easy to learn but of no educational value whatsoever, inappropriate for children or adults who are offended by sexual humor (they just don't get it).That said, I haven't laughed so hard in years."
3,Meh,"What I liked about the book: it was free, the whodunnit was not known until near the end.What I didn't like: the characters were not well developed so there was no real interest in what happened to them, the reason Mary went with Woods was obvious except to the writer, and because the characters were not developed, the end of the story was not satisfying because I just didn't care if someone went to jail."
5,Under Appreciated....,"These guys can sing! Such classic tunes...poignant, painful, heartfelt, soulful and deep. They touched me at the root back then and still do now! No classic soul collection is complete without Enchantment! There is but one fault with this collection---and that is that my favorite song by them ""Forever More"" isn't on it! But I won't deduct a star because I own it on another compilation and besides even without it...this is still a 5 star collection."
1,Not what I thought,It was not the group I thought I was getting. I only liked two songs on the cd. I think I made a bad choice.
5,jack pot!!,"i didn't know how i would remove the scuff marks from the rim of my bathtub and the stains in my tub. i tried everything. so when someone from my job mentioned this product, i thought i'd give it a try. it works.....i am very pelased. will order this product again and again. thanks"
5,Must have,These are a must have item for families! We use them multiple times during the week. I would suggest you keep some handy.
2,Works very well for a very short time,"This product does a lot of things. My favorite is probably removing soap scum from shower doors and walls. It really works very well and it takes very little effort. I also use it for removing grime from paint, and miscellaneous other chores. My biggest complaint about this product is its short life. It disintegrates rapidly and really only handles one job. For instance, if you plan to clean your shower surround, it is likely to last only through that project. I'm not sure what's on this ""eraser"", but it's hard on the hands. Wear gloves."
4,"Very good,","The magic eraser is very effective on crayon, grease, scuffs, and other trouble spots. Great on shower scum! You must be careful because it will strip finishes and paint. Very good even on textured surfaces. It does seem to wear down quickly for the price though (one shower cleaning and it's done). My neighborhood dollar store sells a knockoff for 2 for $1.00 and they work just as well. They breakdown quicker, but at 75% less, they're worth it! Bottom line... great for trouble spots, but don't waste them on everyday messes."
2,the deal is good but the effect is kind of....,"I mean this is a great deal comaring with the one sold in the supermarket. The service from the reseller is also great. But the effect after using this is not that great as I expect. I have purchased this particular item from CVS, Lucky or Saftway. It can clean my bathtub very well but after using this one, I have to double my time and usage to make the same result. I am going to try with advanced Magic Eraser to see it I can get better result."
4,Odd and very useful,"Odd and very useful item in the house. I even use it in my home metal/ wood fabrication shop for some patinas, prepping for epoxy etc, in addition to regular kitchen cleaning."
5,"Not quite magic, and need some elbow grease, but does what it says...","Basically, the title is it. Requires elbow grease. Gets off most wall-gunk and marks better than a lot of other products. Went through about 4 on the walls of my 700 sq-ft apt before I moved out. Worked as expected and as advertised. Will definitely utilize the remainder in the new place. Just remember, it's not totally magic, but the walls looked GREAT after using them. I def recommend as a cheap and effective means to get your walls almost back to new-looking. Enjoy!"
5,does wat it says,Does the job. Only thing is finishes quick as its getsthinner each time used. Workswell on tough stove cleaning. Removes pen mark on wall. Removes prints or stain on stainless steel appliance likefridge ndishwasher.wud buy again.
5,Good Stuff.,"I was skeptical but this thing is pure magic. I use it for computers, shoulderbags, stains on the wall--so far unresponsive to anything else--you name it. Good Stuff."
5,Incredible!,"I have had scuff marks on flooring when my husband dragged something across the floor a year ago, since then I have tried a steam mop, hand washing, special cleaners etc. and still it was all scuffed up. I was going to give up and then saw these and figured I have tried everything else. I did one scuff mark and it was like magic!Gone quickly with little effort it looks like it was never there! Now I need to go over the rest and I am sure they will come up as well as the first. I can't wait to see what else I can use this on.I have dirt marks on the wall that don't take to regular washing so will try that next. Thanks Mr Clean for making my floor look new again:0)"
5,Cleans everything!,"I've been using the Magic Erasers for quite some time, but what prompted me to write a review was that I had some scuff marks on my black car from God only knows what that I couldn't get off with anything. I tried a Magic Eraser (per a Google search) and, sure enough, off it came. The Google search did warn that the Magic Eraser might take off your top coat, but all it took off of my car were the scuff marks. The top coat looks much better now that you can actually see it beneath the scuff marks.I also use this on almost every other stain including marks that my son puts on my walls and doors. It works amazingly well and I always have extras on hand for whatever comes up."
4,Nice product makes cleaning much easier.,"Pros: really powerful and magic. It makes removing stains on the counter, stove top ... much much easier than before. I don't know what happened. It looks just like a normal sponge but thicker and softer. But it did work great. You don't need those cleaning fluid, bleach. Just add some water and scrub a little bit and the stains are gone, even very greasy ones.Cons: I hope it can last a little bit longer. But after using it a couple of time, some small pieces started to fall off. (Maybe I scrubbed too hard?)"
5,Mr. Clean Magic Eraser,Best product of it's kind. Very pleased with results and will continue to purchase as needed. It also lasts longer than expected.
4,"Nice product, nice price","These handy little cleaning items seemed high priced when I first saw them, but the price of this larger package was very reasonable. They do the job of cleaning up the bathroom fixtures very nicely."
4,Good for making the tub white,Our tub had some stubborn gray soap scum and these magic eraser cleaning sponges helped to make it white again.
3,Not impressed,"It does the job of a regular old acrylic safe & aquarium safe sponge. No more, no less. Still satisfied with my purchase, but actually I've used some sponges with a plastic scrub pad on the back that don't scratch acrylic and do a better job than these, so if there's any extra cost for these because of the high ratings, I wouldn't spend the extra money. There's probably other sponges for less on here that do a better job."
3,my shower,i purchased these planning on cleaning my shower as it is dirty and public to other house residents. i figure we can work together and clean up for real instead of just spraying and wiping.
2,Could be better,This product does a good job but has a very short useful life. It needs to be made more substantial in order to last longer while using it for scrubbing.
1,Falling apart,"I'm wondering if I received a bad batch because everyone I've used has fallen apart within three or four gentle swipes...hunks of it, not small pieces. I contacted the main company and their email rep said basically: well, duh, it's an eraser so it's going to act like one.I've been using these for over 2 years and these are the first I've trouble with. After wiping down two bathrooms sinks twice there are so many chunks missing they have to be thrown away. No more for me."
2,Agree with other reviewers,"Me too was fooled by the picture, and the fact that the description actually says ""switch"". Just add a comma behind ""switch"", and it is included.Bad practice IMO or just bad oversight.Amazon, I hope you read our reviews and update the description before others have to deal with that frustration as well.I even missed the deadline for return due to an extended vacation. Of course I probably need another lanyard one of these days, but who knows if I find this one then in the mess I call a garage :)"
1,Break apart,"After giving these sponges several chances to work, their tendency to break apart after just two or three uses means I'll never buy them again. Odd that they aren't made to withstand normal usage."
1,Highly over-rated product,"Bought a couple of these Magic Eraser at local retail just to check it out. Totally unimpressed. An ordinary sponge and water worked just as well, for the several different types of markings and soils I tried it on. For extra cleaning power, dampen the ordinary sponge with Simple Green , either full strength or diluted.The only thing ""Magic"" about the product, was how it separated me from a few dollars. Don't waste your money on it."
3,Works OK,These cleaning pads weren't very impressive. You really need some sort of cleaner to get rid of stains. It's good because they are disposable so less germs. Otherwise they aren't really that impressive.
3,Good as a wall cleaner,Which is the only thing these erasers excel at they got rid of deep down dirt and god knows what that was left on my door and a black scruff mark that i thought would not come off. But to use it on over things like tile or you fridge is just a waste of time. They also break off when you scrub to hard. Actually the Up and Up(Targets brand) work better they clean up more and don't fall apart as much as the magic eraser. Not to mention you can get the four pack of the Target brand for the price of two of the Mr. Cleans.
4,Worked pretty well,"Worked well on some surfaces that have had stains for a while. Used them to get marker off the wall, and it rubbed off the paint, as I would have expected."
1,Mr Clean Magic Eraser disintegrates,"The very first time I squeezed water out, it broke in half! Then while gently scrubbing a small (5""x6"") leather purse, it simply crumbled away. When there was about 1/3 of one (of one 1/2) left, it actually did begn removing scuffs...but was crumbling so badly by that time the crumbles were getting all over the purse, which I had to rinse and dry with a cottten washcloth to remove. What a total waste of money, time and energy. NEVER again! I have the pieces, do you want them back?"
1,Didn't work for me,This product did not work for me in the least. It was an overpriced sponge that fell apart after one use. Didn't get any stains off or clean the grout. Didn't even clean the sink properly (I had to use a dish brush to finish the job). The only thing this product was good at doing was inducing curses.
5,A miracle of science,"So Arthur C Clark said that ""Any suitably advanced technology would appear as magic to a less advanced civilization"" I think these are in the class. I have been looking for ways to clean scuff marks off my wall for months and clean some persistent grease form my range. With these and a little water, I was able to do in minutes what I have spent hours doing every other way I could find, without any success.If you have someplace that can't take aBrillo Steel Wool Soap Pads Jumbo, Red, 30 Countpad, but something is not coming off, these are a great way to handle it."
4,Great product for multiple cleaning purposes,"Overall very happy with this product.... these work great for cleaning pretty much any surface, I use these primarily on my marble kitchen counters. I also use these to clean my handle bar tape on my road bicycle.... I have white grip tape that gets dirty very easily and amazingly these get them almost back to perfectly white! Only negative is how fast you can use up each sponge, they tend to break apart very quickly depending on what surface you are cleaning."
1,Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Cleaning Pads,I was not impressed. I would not order this again. They do not last long and do not do the job.
4,worked like a charm..,"It worked like a charm on my bath tub (hard water stains, salt stains etc), bathroom tiles, oil/grease stains on microwave surface. I tried CLR first and Magic eraser did better than CLR where ever I used.."
3,"Good for some tasks, fails at others.","I'm always a bit surprised as to what my Magic Erasers will clean and what they won't. For example, they would not clean dirt off my shoe, but got a red dye stain out of my sink.The other issue I have with them is that they crumble very easily.However, when they work, they work well, and they have saved the day a couple times. I'm glad I have them on hand."
5,Awesome!,"I had a dirty pair of Chucks I loved but the rubber was dirty and looked pretty gross so I was fearing I'd have to get rid of them. Bought the magic eraser, poured a little water on it, and after 5 or so minutes of scrubbing my shoes looked much much cleaner! Check out the customer submitted image for a before and after."
4,works good. its like fine sandpaper.,"thats why it cleans well, it shaves off a bit of the surface when you scrub. careful on shiny parts, or places where texture is important."
5,clean all the things...,"This works great everywhere in your house. It cleans kitchen counters with a breeze and they look great to. The only problem I have with this is it gets dirty fast so you have to buy a good supply of these erasers, which can be expensive. I think this product is great because it cleans everything that I need it to clean."
4,"Moving out, clean up with Mr. Clean","It's inevitable that when you move out of any place your going to notice, it was a lot dirtier than you expected. Especially the walls, which tend to have unexplainable scuffs and scraps. The best plan of attack is to first use caulk on any holes (I recommend the drydex with pink indicator), then use Mr.Clean one every wall. Now be careful how you use this guy, the harder you scrub, the more ""magic"" you use up. The trick is this thing is made of formadehyde-melamine-sodium bisulfite copolymer, which effectively acts like really really fine sandpaper. Therefore you can use it to sand down the caulk you put, while rubbing all the scuffs you want out. As always there is a downside, which in this cause was it's effect on bare hands. If you don't have gloves, make sure to use lotion (I recommend neutrogena) to give your hands the moisture it needs."
5,It Is Magic!!!,"I am a big fan of Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Original. I bought my first one years ago thinking ""Sure, this will work just like it says - NOT!"". Boy was I WRONG! I was so amazed I couldn't stop telling my friends just how wonderful this product is. I even bought my uncle some for his house. The only Achilles' heel of this product is that it is used up quickly. Towards the end, it breaks up into little pieces.I have tried the Bath Scrubber and the Extra Power ones. They pale in comparison. Oh, they work; but, they have an even shorter life span than my beloved Original."
4,Melts Away,"It does what it promises. But, cleaning requires Much Effort with this sponge as both sides are very soft. There is no scraper on it. The worst part is that after cleaning just two dirty tiles on my kitchen floor, it evaporates into nothing. It just magically melts into thin air too quickly. I'll be needing a lot more for 100 tiles..."
1,Cheap,Dont waste ur money. Plastic cracks. Mop head stays dirty. Lasts only one week of light use. Avoid this junk like the plague!
1,Worthless,I saw no advantage of these cleaning pads over just the old scotch-bite yellow and green sponges. They fall apart much to easy and there is no advantage in their ability to clean.
5,Name says it all. It's magic,I was skeptical about this product. I was so impressed after using it on my bathtub for the first time. Cleaned it without a problem. I'd recommend it to everyone!
2,for die hard fans & Beatles collectors only!,"Like the part 1, this cd features the rough mixes, mono demo recording, rough studio chats. This re-released is dedicated especially to the die hard fans only. Because they will be happy with this release. Though the sound quality of this part two is a bit better than another one.PS: Paul mc cartney and Ringo Starr are still expecting all your money. Need I say more ?"
1,BEATLES ANTHOLOGY 2,ORDERED THIS ITEM ON FEBRUARY 20; TODAY IS MARCH 5 AND STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE CD. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG TO RECEIVE ANY ITEM.
5,Anthology 2,Ordered these for my husband as a Christmas Gift.He was very pleased with this product.Definitely recommend.I purchased all three
1,Enough is enough,"Please. The first anthology worked nicely as a cute ""Why Did We Ever Like This?"" reminder of just how bad this music was. Kind of like all those 'Livin in the 80s' compilations. But enough is enough. This is the 60s equivalent of Hanson today: cute, fluffy, mindless, not for people over 15. But somehow, so many people still take the Beatles' undeserved popularity as evidence that they were actually meaningful, artistic, or respectable. Sorry, but I have no respect for meaningless lyrics and 'music' that wouldn't even make it onto a cartoon soundtrack today."
4,strawberry fields FOREVER,"I find hearing Strawberry Fields go from it's embryonic stage as an almost delta blues to ""finished product"" not only fascinating, but enlightening and gratifying as well."
5,THE BEST OF THE THREE ANTHOLOGYS,"ALMOST UP THERE WITH ALL OF THERE STUDIO MASTERPIECES,THIS IS THERE MOST CREATIVE PERIOD,1965-1968. THIS IS MUST LISTENING FOR ANYBODY WHO LIKES LISTNING TO TALENT,AND THESE GUYS WHERE SO FAR AHEAD OF ANYBODY ELSE THEN AND NOW IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY! LISTEN TO THIS AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN. YOU KNOW THE SONGS,NOW LISTEN TO HOW THEY CAME INTO BEING."
5,This collection of Beatles songs cannot be surpassed.,This collection of Beatles songs cannot be surpassed by any other collection of any other band ever.
4,Grass Gator and blades,"Good product. Easy to install on my Ryobi weedwacker. Not sure about the heavy duty part though...I would have expected the blades to last a little bit longer. Mine wore down quickly, HOWEVER, I must admit they were used in very rough underbrush and hit many a root and rock. I would definitely buy again"
2,Gator blade,"I had one of these a few years ago and really liked it, It was tough and worked really well.I decided to get another one. The newer one is less tough,It seems to be made with a cheaper plastic (the main body). I was trimming around some cement the bottom of the head rubbed against the cement a few times and it thinned it so much one of the pins and the blade fell off. rendering it unsafe to use. so i went and bought a Pivotrim,, Love it!"
3,Where is Iran?,"In this book of famous people in the last 1000 years, there is no sign of even a single persona from Iran. Neither people from the old time (Avicina, Abu-reihan Biruni, Khayam, Kharazmi, and so on), nor from the present time. Is this book politically biased? Do you think that you can make a nation like Iran disappear so easily just if you do not write about it in your book? Iran has survived many ups-and-downs in the course of its harsh history. It will do so."
1,To western!,I am a huge shoujo fan and this is deppressing. The art in this book doesn't even LOOK like manga. Even a begginer can figure that out. I mean I showed this book to my friend who doesn't even like manga and she could even figure out that Hart is terrible at manga. Beggieners or advance stay away! Instead of wasteing your money on this dinky little 60 paged book try the how to draw manga series. You might accually LEARN how to draw real manga!
2,S'ok,"My daughter says the style is not quite what she was looking for, she feels that it's not very instructional. Sbe said Magical girls and friends was wayyy better by christopher hart, and actually that is the book that drew me to try his others. She's 11 and loves to draw from pictures she sees on the computer, she just started this past year and is a real beginner."
1,This is not manga.,"Being a manga artist myself, I must declare- Hart is not a manga artist. His work is just mere cartoon with a little touch of manga. Before buying this book, I advise you to look inside. If you are going to buy this book for your child as most people do, then buy one of the HTDM (How To Draw Manga). If you present this as a first manga book for your child whatsoever, then it will just ruin his or her art style.As of what I have seen, this book will attempt to make you or your children copy his mere artwork. All of his steps are exactly like many other manga books, only the art is much much worse.My final line is, I DEFINITELY do NOT reccommend this book. If I could, I would have rated this 0 stars. If I was him, I wouldn't go selling books before I learn more about Manga."
4,good,I was going to give it just 3 star for the long shipping but the book was better than good. It could have use better wrapping but it's Ok. The book it self has little information but it's better than what they teach you in school.
5,Arch Merrill,This is another book by this author that I have thoroughly enjoyed reading. He writes about the history of the early settlements of the Indians in western New York State. I was born and raised in this area and believe this is the reason for the fascination of these books. I have received excellent service from Amazon.com in purchasing these books via the internet.
4,UNDERRATED,"Bob Manning is a great singer who never got the popularity he deserved, and this album is a good testament to his talent."
3,Talky AND Snoozy,"I am a HUGE Edith Layton fan...her ""The Cad"" is probably one of the best romance novels ever written, and I highly recommend it (if you can find it). This book, however, is more like one of her old Avon regencies - there is more time spent chatting and recouping what's happened, than on your average episode of a daytime soap. How someone can't recognize someone who they allegedly were so close to, and who has such striking physical features,is too implausible to get past, from the get go. Snoozy..."
3,"""Tis a pity alright..""","This play is an excellent example of incest in the Renaissance. It's also fairly short and very readable. Bergetto is an interesting character and provides much needed comic relief in this play which is ultimately quite tragic. The title is misleading in many ways, but female sexuality is problematic throughout."
5,The Limeliters - Through Children's Eyes,"One of the endearing things that came from the folk era was that groups like the Limeliters and Peter, Paul and Mary were interested in educating the children. While teaching life lessons, their songs are fun for both children and adults. The children participation songs are fun to listen to and the Limeliters candid reactions are wonderful."
5,Limeliters rediscovered,"What to get my grand-daughter for Christmas? Her mom suggested a CD of children's music.I have an old vinyl record of the this CD, but would it hold up in today's world?The CD was a great hit! Mom says it is played constantly at home and in the car on trips, they can all sing-along.""Through Childrens' Eyes"" has withstood the test of time. Thanks Limeliters!"
5,The Best!,"I loved this (it was an album then) CD from childhood. Then my children's childhood. And now, my grandchildren's childhood. That's how much I have enjoyed this music over the years. Each generation has loved it also. It is my standard baby gift and everyone who receives it says the same thing, ""This is great.""Not only is the music wonderful, but most of the songs have a message that the kids (and adults) pick up on very quickly. Buy it - you won't be sorry."
5,A must for any family.,"My siblings and I grew up with this record and wore out the LP. I was thrilled to find it again and gave a copy to my mother, brother and two sisters. My children love to listen to it in the car, sing along and laugh. If you are tired of the same old kids records, this is a great change."
5,One of the all-time classic albums!,"This album is a classic and should be in everyone's library. Kids especially love the music because of the school children who sing with the Limeliters.All Limeliter music is desirable if you like folk music, but EVERYONE, folk music fan or not, will enjoy this CD. Just play it for a small child and they will be in a trance until the album is done.5 stars. 6 if they are allowed!!"
3,How you can really speak english...,"This book helps a lot to learn the language that we all need in USA, it helped a lot to my mother who always complained of not being able to find cassetes (at a good price) to learn and practice the important language."
1,them sent me one broken then sent back and they chared me for a new one,dont buy from this store they double charge u so i 53 plus 53 106 bucks and they keep ur credit card info so they charge dont buy from them i want my 53.23 back my contact email is evoking516@aol.com i would like the money back name ricky
2,Unhappy with this flatware,"This set is lightweight. The tablespoons are very small. Some of the pieces are stained, still in the box. I wonder what they'd look like after some use. I currently have a set of Cuisinart flatware that I bought at Sam's Club years ago for $20. That set is much better quality than this Oneida set. I've lost some Cuisinart pieces, so want a replacement set, but this is not the one!"
1,"Not worth the money, but better than plastic","If you are looking for a quality set of silverwar, KEEP LOOKING! These are shiny but very flimsy. This set is equivalant to something you could buy at a discount store .... It is packaged very cheply and the dinner fork weighs about an ounce about the same as a heavy plastic fork. I sent my set back immediately after opening and feeling their lack of heft. I read the other reviews before I ordered, but I was looking for a much higher quality from this purchase. I think if you are looking for a quality set of stainless it is much better to buy onsale at a good department store."
5,Best Kitchen Flatware,"This set has excellent balance, good weight and simply feels substantial. It is excellent grade stainless which is absolutely maintenance free. The wide availability makes replacing pieces or adding with the serving set an excellent investment in kitchenware."
2,"Fine, but thin","I picked the style because I thought it was nice and the price is great. However, when I received it today, I was dissapointed in the weight of the flatware. The knives are great but the rest are thin. I have another pattern in Oneida and it is much heavier. I am going to search for a different pattern and try again."
2,Sorry I bought this,"I grabbed this book on my annual Christian bookstore trip (I live outside the US) and didn't have a lot of time to peruse the couples' devotionals. I picked it based on Bob and Emilie's many other published products. I'm sorry I didn't take more time choosing. I'm sure Bob and Emilie are a sweet couple; however... From the meandering prose to the oft-trite questions, to the seeming random sequence of the book, this just is not a great product. It has been the source of some good discussion between me and my wife, but mostly about what we found lacking or awkward."
4,very useful item,i am using it everything i go to restarunts and its a very useful item. but you need to make sure your bags not too heavy as it could put off and break from extra weight
4,OK,"I ordered this on line because you can't always rely on Home Depot having stock. I was really looking to see what might be available for just general tying things together. I guess this is about as good as it gets. Generally I use it to hold coiled cable for my radios in place. Works OK, sometimes a little difficult to cut with one hand while your holding the cable in place with the other...guess I could cut a piece first and hope it's long enough..."
4,like it too,it's a good product and i know the company for so long been in the market of course is not something you feel right away
4,If you want mo' Helmet-PICK IT UP!,"For the drooling Helmet fanatic,""Strap It On"" is an excellent addition to their worship alter-err,record collection.It's got the goods;anthemic melodies,chunky riffs and hooks you can hang your winter parka on.Cuts like ""Rude"",""Blacktop"" and ""Make Room"" are so choice,i search in vain for a worthy adjective!However,there is a downside.The production/recording quality leaves something to be desired.It's not awful by any stretch,but it is noticible to someone who has revelled in the clarity and uberheaviness of ""Meantime"" and ""Aftertaste"".By all means,pick this puppy up.No one will ever duplicate Helmet's sound,although many bands have tried!"
5,"Brass knuckles, Ballpeen hammers and Belt sanders","Like shots to the jaw from a brass knuckled fist...ballpeen hammers tap, tap, tapping at your temples......enjoy having your face forcibly held against a belt-sander?this is hardcore, deal with it!"
1,Be One of the Smart Guys!,"Folks, the obvious solution to the mis-marking of its products by Oneida is not to buy it! Why put yourself through ANY grief? Why HOPE that the set you buy is some of the good stuff? There are plenty of fine competing products. If at some time in the future both Amazon (or any other vendor) and Oneida issue clear statements about the manufacture of Oneida products, smart folks can then begin to buy. Otherwise, sad to say, if you buy the product amidst this confusion, and in light of Oneida's deceptive practices (which might make you want to re-consider the whole deal!), and your flatware begins to rust because you didn't get the ""good"" version you were hoping they'd ship(!), then your name will not go on the list of smart guys. Full Disclosure: I do not own any Oneida, nor will I. I am reading reviews to find some flatware to buy. I have always found Amazon to be superb to deal with. I lay all of this mess at the feet of Oneida. Thank you. Thank you very much."
2,Fellini's Great Composer,"Fellini's films are practically unimaginable without the music of Nino Rota, and in fact there are very few Fellini films without it. However I find this compilation a bit disappointing, though I'm not totally sure why. The tracks are short, just 3 or 4 minutes, and taken out of context, I don't know, it just feels like something's missing, perhaps a sense of continuity. Certainly this is not to disparage their brilliance within their filmic context. But I caution the potential buyer. If you're buying just one Rota score, perhaps a better choice would be to buy that of your favorite Fellini film."
2,What happened ?,"I'm not certain why this CD is so disappointing. The selections from the films are strung together in an uninteresting way, and seem to be played at the same tempo. I plan to order Fellini soundtracks, because I love the music. Maybe a Czech symphony orchestra just can't capture Rota's sensual Italian spirit."
4,good radio,I use this radio for police duty....It handles my needs in a 20 mile radius.... easy to use..
1,An Anthropological Dead End...,"When initially published, these essays provided a salutary textual critique of anthropology. Today they read as essays whose implications are circumscribed to the work of that generation of American cultural anthropologists who developed in the shadows of modernist giants (namely Geertz). This collection represents their mid-life crisis, rather than the field of ethnography. Most of their students (and students' students) have not repeated that generation's unreflexive ethical idealism and political naivete. This progress was not a result of these essays. The exception in this book is Tyler's innovative and actually experimental proposal for ""writing culture"". Otherwise, be warned. Read these critiques by baby boomer-era anthropologists with a grain of salt."
5,Chicken Coop Dominoes game w/ tin,FUN! FUN!! FUN!!! Our family will get together with other families to play this. Really loads of fun for all ages young and old.
5,"Kimmie's Very Special ""Concept Album""","It's important to let go of any cynicism you might have to appreciate this album fully.I am a fan of Kimmie's previous albums and at first missed the ""gutsy rootsiness"" present in that earlier work, as this album is musically lighter (though impeccably produced and crafted by Kimmie's son Gabe).Lyrically though, it is highly advanced and together the songs form a kind of concept album of meditations on life and death, this world and the next.The sheer positivity of the lyrics form a great recipe for living life and to see the world as Kimmie does in these songs is, in my opinion, truly a way to deep personal happiness.Kimmie is obviously not a person to be pinned down or categorised into one type of music. I look forward to discovering whatever she comes up with next and shall certainly be using this album as one of my aids to my own personal growth and happiness."
2,Vapid and Tuneless Journey,"After ""West Texa Heaven"" I was looking forward to Kimmie Rhodes' next album. Once ""Rich From the Journey"" was released, I waited for sample audio cuts to appear. They never materalized so I eventually took a chance. That was a mistake.I think this album was appropriatly described by a previous reviewer (Wick Smith). It is devoid of melody and nearly unlistenable. It's a big disappointment for me."
2,Poor From the Journey,"About $15 poorer.I was shocked that a CD so well received by others here, and associated in some way with Stacey Earle and Gillian Welch, could be so disappointing. This is one of the few CDs that actually made me angry as I listened to it. The lyrics are vapid ""flower child"" rhymes, matched perfectly to the liner visuals which are also fuzzy and incoherent. Arrangements are syrupy sweet.Musically, there is also little of interest here. It is sort of ultra-mellow folk country new age etherial wallpaper. And I have a high wisp threshold. I can happily listen to Enya or Maire Brennan, or Sarah McClaughlin. But this is even less edgy than those. Kimmie has a whispering lower register and very restricted range: something I seldom notice unless it is extreme. My verdict: this is Disney elevator dentist waiting room BGM.I'm going to read those other glowing listener comments one more time and see if I can reconcile any of it with what I heard."
2,Spiritualized third LP loses edge of earlier work,"Having so brilliantly captured the essences of West Texas on her previous LP, this effort is a huge disappointment. Rhodes abandons her edgy country sound for soft, meandering instrumentation and melodies that often go nowhere, much like new age music. The lyrical content is filled with treacly '70s spiritualism, and Rhodes often reduces her delicate voice to an overweening whisper.Those who were attracted to Rhodes' ""West Texas Heaven"" by the keenness of her poetic observations and the rootsy sound with which they were presented will find little to like here. Unless, of course, you also happen to like mellow, somewhat saccharine, idealism."
3,Whets the Appetite,"This '95 album of Count Bass D's is different from his 2004 release, Dwight Spitz, in that it has boring beats and rhymes about being a player instead of rhymes about keeping hip hop real. It's a good album, but by far is only a Pre-Life Crisis before the man finds his plan and begins to spit."
1,callie and son,"very very very poor quality film, it looked like a copy of a copy, if the price of returning this poor dvd didn't cost almost as much as the return i would have returned this dvd; point blank. thank you"
2,Not for Volleyball!,"This ""2-Game"" set is really a badminton set with a volleyball thrown in. The poles are 5'1"", which is not ideal for volleyball unless you're an Ewok!I'm also disappointed in the quality of the badminton rackets - very cheap plastic grips."
3,Good but Not Great,"First off I would say that this is NOT a bad book. It is a reasonable guide to wine and will give you some basic facts. My main complaint is that while the book gives you a comprehensive overview of wine regions, storing wine, and pairing wine, it barely touches on grape varieties and actually tasting wine. It would be a very good book for an aspiring connoisseur, who wishes to go above and beyond simple tasting. For those who wish to receive a basic understanding of main grape/wine varieties and how to taste/classify wines, there are much better books available. The book has some very useful knowledge and discusses the intriguing topic of connoisseurship, but lacks the essential background information for anyone starting out in the wine world."
2,As others have said... buy paper locally,"The outfit that sold this paper did a crappy job of packaging and the corner of the ream was crushed on arrival making a third of the paper unusable. And it is worth mentioning that the ""98"" whiteness rating on this Hammermill product is way off. It has a yellow cast that makes it inferior to many others."
4,Short but Helpful Read - Unspeakable Losses,Really informative & compassionate book. I found the case studies helpful. It would be great if the author wrote an updated edition as a lot has changed in reproductive technologies & psychological effects. I liked how she covered all types of losses.
3,Don't need anymore therapy,"The most helpful and healing part of this book was when the author shared her own experiences of how she came to peace with her own infertility and losses. There was too much about how pregnancy loss shed light on the unresolved childhood issues of her patients. LONG before I ever tried to get pregnant, I did my time in therapy (years of it) where I uncovered my childhood hurts and forgave my parents, etc etc etc. Yes infertility pushes some buttons about being a teenager for me for sure, but what I want the most right now are words to help me deal with the present pain of the losses from infertility and miscarriage. The author's personal experience on the last 2 pages was worth getting the book for those of us who don't need anymore therapy."
3,Not what I expected,"I read this book within a week after my premature son, born at 23 weeks, died after 21 hours. While it validates feelings of anguish and despair associated with losing a part of you, this book just didn't touch me the way I hoped it would. The author tells her own story and re-teels stories of clients who have suffered miscarriage, abortion, neonate deaths or stillbirth. While the feelings of parents who have expreienced these losses are similar, I felt they were too different to be grouped together. In my opinion, the book dealt too greatly with abortion."
1,Not for Me,I didn't get passed the opening. The thought that an abortion and a miscarriage are the same thing is absurd. I wouldn't recommend it if your wounds are still fresh.
1,An insensitive approach,"My son was stillborn at 26 weeks, and this was one of the books I looked at in the aftermath. I had been too upset to notice the word ""abortion"" in the title, so it wasn't until I was paging through the book -- and reading about a woman who chose to abort her child -- that it hit me. The author was actually treating what happened to me -- my very much wanted child died due to a cord accident -- with those women who choose to abort their children. I do think that a book dealing with the emotional aftermath of abortion would be a good topic to explore, and it might be very helpful to those women how have had abortions. But I view the death of my child as an unbearable and tragic loss, and to treat my loss the same as an abortion is not only tacky, its cruel."
5,Anthology 1,Ordered these for my husband as a Christmas Gift.He was very pleased with this product.Definitely recommend.I purchased all three
1,BEWARE!!! Not the original songs,"You might think that you are getting your favorite Beatles songs here, but beware that most of them actually are rehearsal versions, different takes (some of them partial), there are several different takes of the same song here and there, and sadly, some of the most popular songs' original versions are missing (again, replaced by annoying rehearsal versions). You are MUCH better of buying separate albums than collecting this hodgepodge of ""takes"""
1,Listen to the Stones instead,"Sadly enough, the Beatles were never as good as The Rolling Stones. They just never reached their heights in excellence.The majority of the songs recorded by the Beatles were silly and childesh. The Beatles are one of the most overrated bands in history. Their finished albums are not even very good so how could their bloopers be any better? This is a dull album from one of the worst bands in all history."
3,Scraps and leftovers,"One of the many, many brilliant things about the Beatles was the fact that they somehow never failed to choose the absolute best versions of their songs for their albums.Therefore, the anthology series presents all of the inferior alternative, demo, or half-done versions of the familiar songs. It amounts to an album filled with Beatles leftovers. On the other hand, this group's ""leftovers"" are easily better than 95% of everyone else's ""main courses.""Anthology 1 is the weakest of the three anthology albums, because it comes from a period before the Beatles were purely a studio band. Also, the recording quality of a lot of this stuff leaves much to be desired.However, for Beatles fanatics, it is an essential document. It also gathers up all of the unreleased songs that have been floating around on bootlegs for years, and cleans these up as much as possible. A very good collection, for what it is meant to be -- a historical document."
5,The Beatles Anthology One,"Material from an intense period of development, including the covers from the hundreds of hours on stage in Hamburg that forged them into professionals. A glimpse into the begginings of the greatest band there ever was or ever will be!"
2,There's a reason this stuff was never released...,"Because it was bad! I am a lifelong Beatles fan, but I was incredibly disappointed with this collection when it came out, and 4 1/2 years later I'm still disappointed. Are we that hard up to hear The Beatles that we'll dig up any garbage they ever did? Just because these tracks are historical doesn't mean they are necessarily good. The only track I play from this set is Free As A Bird, a song which brought tears to my eyes when I first heard it, and still does even after the past few years. It deserves 5 stars on its own. The rest of the disc is quite average, I'll stick to the finished versions that The Beatles wanted out, not this rubbish. George Harrison even called this type of material just ""scraping of the barrell for all the Beatles tracks people can find."""
2,woah! only in mono!!,"Free as a bird is the only new song in 1996,...but where are the rest of unreleased Lennon songs ?The other songs had been cut from the original mono tapes in the early 60's, which includes the breakable Quarry men or (the silver Beetle) first single like Cayenne, like dreamers do, or Inspite of the danger. I'm not a huge fan of them....the whole extended versions were transfered poorly from the EMI studio from 1960 - 1965,.....you can hear the rough mixes, studio chats, interviews. The die hard Beatles fans will surely love this one.PS: check out deep purple Anthology! that one is much much better than beatles anthoogy series. I tell ya no lies! cheers"
3,"As a beatles fan, I was let down","Too much unneccessary unfinished songs. For a soft fan, maybe it would be nice."
2,Only for the hardcore fans,"Being pretty much forced to surrender my gift certificate to this rather than ""Mellon Collie"", I was almost put off the Beatles right off the bat. I didn't like this CD. Aside from ""Free as a Bird"" and some of the later tracks nearing their creative golden age, I just didn't like the songs. Maybe I'm picking bones, but at the time I wasn't a hardcore-enough fan to go ga-ga over 15 second snippets of interviews with John Lennon and some bad-sounding demos. Historic significance didn't really mean much to me back then, and it still doesn't today. Perhaps one day I will give this album a thorough listen to see if I like it, but the last time I listened to it, it still didn't click with me. Stick with the next two Anthologies, especially number 2: two discs of embryonic genius."
2,in mono only! only for die hard fans!,"watch out!the songs were mixed & recorded in mono only with the bonus rough /poor studio chats, poor outtakes! where is another lennon's unreleased song? free as abird is not the only one unreleased track! there are many more Lennon lost tapes which do not appear in this cd.the cover is interresting but I dont like the recording of poor outtakes what George martin did in the EMI company."
3,Great for diehard fans. OK for others.,"The Beatles Anthology 1 is a staple of diehard Beatles fans. It contains clip after clip of sound bites and off-takes of popular tunes. If you're looking for a greatest hits collection, this is not it. If you want to learn more about the Fab Four's journey to find themselves and their music, this is the album."
3,From 1958-1964-This is a decent rarities collection,"The first CD is pretty lame. About half the songs are live covers. There are also some audition tapes. Not all that much. The second CD is better. Hilarious versions of ""No Reply"", ""I'll Be Back"", and ""One After 909"". I also think this version of ""8 Days A Week"" is better than the original version. I agree that this is mostly for die hard fans."
4,"HISTORICALLY, IT'S A MUST HAVE","KEEPING IN MIND WHAT THIS IS,UNRELEASED STUDIO MATERIAL,THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR YOU COLLECTION,AND THERE ARE ENOUGH GEMS ON HERE TO WARRENT THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS THAT IT HAS SOLD.IT'S INTERESTING THAT STUDIO DEMOS AND OUTTAKES BY THE BEATLES ARE STILL FAR SUPERIOR THEN MOST OTHER ARTISTS FINISHED PRODUCTS.LEAVE MY KITTEN ALONE, EIGHT DAYS A WEEK , CERTAIN LIVE CUTS,AND SOME TOTALLY UNHEARD BITS MAKE THIS A MUST HAVE."
4,A Rock and Roll History Lesson,"Shame that Anthology I got the promotional push it did because of the ""new"" Beatles song, video and TV special. Much can be learned from these two CDs, which feature the Beatles not only creating their musical sound from any number of influences, but their individual and group personas from management, contemporaries and fans. It fascinates, entertains, even contains great music hidden among the scraps and specks. Now, after some of that hype has faded, may be a good time to relisten to the Anthology series."
3,There would be better Anthologies...,"I'm a very big fan of the Beatles, but I don't consider myself that crazy about the early Beatles work. I guess that's why I didn't care for this album as much as the others. Well, that and there were too many live stuff and speeches. There are a few amusing outtakes on ""No Reply,"" ""I'll Be Back"" and ""One After 909."" ""You'll Be Mine"" and the sketch on the Morecambe and Wise show were hilarious. Most of their covers of oldies were acceptable. But overall, it suffers im comparison to Anthologies 1 and 2."
3,Diferent,"The album at all is not bad, but I think Duran Duran hasn't find their own self. The name of the band as well as LeBon's unmistakable style makes the Fans expect a music, style and time that belong to another era, and wich we may not see again. I think that the band is undervalued because what ever they do, no matter how diferent, or new, or evolutional ( music sense ) criticts can't see beyond a 80's band, fashion sensed, glamour, makeup, and color linen suits."
3,Classic Duran style + cheesy rock guitar is a compromise,"Like many Duran albums of late, the quality of tracks on ""Medazzaland"" swing from wonderful to banal. The general trend seems to be that as soon as Warren is allowed to tear loose with his distorted guitar, the subtlties and strong melodies that have been Duran's trademark go out the window (much like the second half of their album ""Liberty""). For every item like ""Midnight Sun"", with it's rolling bassline and delicate treatments, there is ""Who Do You Think You Are?"", a clunky retro-rock number that frankly sounds like nearly-forty-somethings trying to regain some kind of edge. Go figure.Still, there are some winners here, including the totally overlooked ""Out of My Mind"" and ""Electric Barbarella"", and the mysterious ""Buried In the Sand"" that make this album worth having."
3,What are they doing to themselves?!?!,"Contrary to the album ""Thank You"", which was well done, this album was accidentally released. It reminded me of Jane's Addiction at some points. This is not the Duran Duran that I've known for the past so many years. --Dom"
4,They're Back (Again),"Duran Duran has bounced back from bad albums enough times that I'm no longer surprised by it. This album isn't essential stuff, but it's pretty good. ""Electric Barbarella"" and ""Out of My Mind"" are the obvious stand-outs, but I also like ""Undergoing Treatment"" and ""Michael You've Got a Lot to Answer For"". The worst I can say is that there aren't enough ""hook""-y songs that you find yourself singing in the shower the next day. In toto, a good addition to the Duran Duran Canon."
3,Unique album,"I'm a longtime DD fan like many other reviewers here and I agree with many of the reviews already posted. This is an album with some great cuts and some not-so-great. I actually hate the Be My Icon Song with a passion, it might be the worst DD song ever written. Michael is also a weak track . . . but overall I really liked the experimental feel of this album and it is definitely one of their most unique projects."
3,Better but still not there.,"This album proves DD's inconsistency since the quintet disbanded. The last really great DD album is Notorious. Big Thing and Liberty were both disappointing with the latter one being an almost complete failure. Then came The Wedding Album which gave us die-hard fans new hope. With Medazzaland, the boys have managed to confuse me completely. This album has some great tunes and other very forgettable ones. Don't buy it unless you're a DD completist. Recommended downloads - Electric Barbarella, Out of my Mind, Silva Halo. To give you an idea of how much I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, I've even got the Electric Barbarella single hoping for a great B side like the old days - no such luck."
2,Big Duran fan but this one is a letdown.,Along with Pop Trash this is a poor effort. Not really anything that stands out and that includes Electric Barbarella. These guys are always willing to try something new and I think this time it just backfired. Glad that JT is back in the band and although WC is a great guitarist and did an amazing job on the wedding album I think it was time to part ways with him. The last two disc - Astronaut & Red Carpet Massacre show that the band is as fresh as ever and back to making top notch melodic pop songs....leaving behind the lackluster days of Medazzaland & Pop Trash.
3,A pretty good album,"Being the die-hard Duran Duran fan that I am,I picked up a copy of Medazzaland, and found myself singing along and dancing to the rhythmns of these catchy tunes. I found I didn't enjoy the album as much as classic DD stuff, such as my all-time favourite, the ""Rio"" album, but I did enjoy some tracks off this cd immensely! These include ""Big Bang Generation"", ""Electric Barbarella"", and ""Out of My Mind"" to name the top three songs that really took me in. :) I liked ""Out of My Mind"" a lot..finding it similar to my 2nd favourite Duran song of all-time, ""Come Undone"" . I think DD is one of the most talented and best bands I've ever listened to , and ""Medazzaland"" is a nice take...but I'd love to hear another ""Rio"" or ""Wedding Album""."
3,Eh.,"This disc really makes me miss the old Duran Duran. I thought that an electronic DD album would be rapturous, but this really left me cold. Who could have guessed that John Taylor bailing on the band would make the whole thing feel so empty? However, tracks like ""Electric Barbarella"", and the haunting ""Out of My Mind"" (this one will stay with you for DAYS) still hold some of the old fun-loving, romantic, female-obssessed flavor of Duran. I never thought I would miss those ridiculous snipits of female laughter in Duran songs, but I do."
1,Bad copy,The copy of this CD was horrible. The sender just wanted to get rid of it after they scratched it all up. I will not purchase from sender ever.
5,LOVED this set!,"I am glad that I choosed this set! I purchased the set ... and it is a good deal! No other flatware so far can beat this price.I love the European design and the size is perfect for me. The quality is GREAT! I just simply put them in dishwasher and after several months, they are still shining with no scratch at all. Still BRAND NEW looking!"
5,Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for!!,"This set arrived today and I am more than pleased with it! My old set was made by rogers and was thin and cheap. I wanted a nice sturdy set, but also something different from what I have owned in the past. I search high and low for the right set and decided on this one. It is thick, heavy and very pretty! It however is not overly heavy, I am very impressed.For the person who had a problem with it saying made in china, you cannot even see it unless you turn it over. And every set I have ever owned had the same imprint on the back. Pretty much everything is made in another country, doesn't mean it is not great quality.Want quality, buy Oneida because you cannot go wrong with this company."
1,This one sucked too,I do not know what this one was about. I think it was just basically saying how a young man can care for a farm and make a profit off it and how it is inherited to him.
5,A Touch of Class,"What a delight to discover a CD of ""Sandler & Young"". Wonderful mix of great harmony and outstanding music of great class. Too bad there are not that much CD's available. This album is highly recommended!"
4,Fair,"This is a fair collection of The Great Sandler & Young. Buy it if only for your collection. Memories ,oh, but beautiful and yet!"
3,Mistake in book,"Hey, someone correct me if I am wrong but the page that talks about a Buffalo- I'm pretty sure that's a picture of an Ox."
5,Great service,So excited to find this book that I read to my daughters 30 years ago and share it with my granddaughter. The book was in excellent condition and delivered within the week of my visit with her.
5,Great book!,"I love this book. The poetry is witty and the pictures are funny. This is one of the few books from my childhood which I stashed away to keep for my children, and now my children love reading it."
5,Interactive fun,"I gather my grandchildren around me as I read, in different voices, show the pictures and translate a bit into Hebrew. At the appropriate point we roll around on the floor laughing and bumping."
5,Read it again,"When my younger sister received this book as a birthday gift some 25 years ago, it became an immediate favorite of hers and of our four younger siblings. All the animals of the jungle try to persuade the elephant not to sneeze by reminding him of all the terribly hilarious things that happened to them the last time. The ryhmes are great! The illustrations fantastic. And the outcome... well you must read it your self. I'm buying it for all my nieces and nephews. It was one of my siblings favorite nap time stories along with Be Nice to Spiders. It has always reminded me of one of my favorite childhood books 'I can't!' said the Ant."
5,Just as awesome today as it was when I was a kid,I loved this book when I was a child and all three of my children love/d it too :-) What the best part is is that I remember my stepmother reading me this book and she'd speed up and slow down or do voices and I've enjoyed ever so much doing the same thing for my kiddos.
5,Loved 14 years ago; still buying for kids!,"My son (now 18) loved to have this book read over and over again; and I remember this as one of my favorites also. I've just purchased a new copy for my 4 year old nephew; I'm going to read the book onto tape and send him the book and tape so his aunt can ""read"" to him anytime."
5,stand back i'm gonna sneeze--,A wonderful book to read aloud to kids. It is one of our favorite family books.
4,I like this book,"We got this one for our 3 year old. I enjoy reading it and I think its a cute plot. She's been going around ""sneezing"" so we can get out of the way. Its fun."
3,Stick to Chess,"While this isn't a bad book, it's not in the same league as the Soltis and Crouch books. What's annoying about the book is the profusion of religious quotes. If you are going to write a book about chess, stick to chess. If you want to muse about religion and chess, go play on the church chess team."
1,not a good purchase,I was not happy with this purchase because it was not clear as to what kind of memory cards it is good for. It's for all and I was just looking for a case to hold many SD cards.
2,Read this only if you have the time,"American Cold War history and the players who shaped events during this time make it one of the most interesting eras to study. Mr. Chace does a fine job in researching the facts. But the book gets bogged down in the smallest and most trivial details of Mr. Acheson's life (as noted by several reviewers below). You lose a sense of what Mr. Acheson is doing. I simply find it hard to believe that one reviewer below stated: ""Chace manages to render a full portrait of Acheson without getting bogged down in the minutiae of his long and extraordinary public life."" The book is so full of minutiae that few people will want to finish reading it.I do recommend this book for students and history buffs who want to confirm certain facts of Mr. Acheson's life and policies. Otherwise, an edited edition of this book will go a long way for many readers interested in Cold War history."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I loved I, CLAUDIUS, and I was really looking forward to reading CLAUDIUS THE GOD. Unfortunately, I felt that this one pales in comparison to the original. The story of Herod Agrippa at the beginning of the book was very interesting, but Graves rapidly gets bogged down in tedious details as he describes Claudius' reign. He has a tendency to delve into anecdotes and engage in needlessly complex narrative structures. Although there are some amusing and interesting stories spread throughout, I felt Graves took way too much time building up exposition and describing every little detail. Overall, I was disappointed with CLAUDIUS THE GOD and vastly prefer the original."
5,More Genius from Robert Graves,"You must read ""I, Claudius"" first, but then you won't be able to stop, and you'll be so glad there's this second volume. A work of towering genius. This is my third copy, as I wore out the others."
2,"Not was good as ""I, Claudius!""","I was very excited to pick up the conclusion of the story of Claudius told so brilliantly in the first book, I, Claudius. The second book in the series fell short. For me, far short. It simply spent too much time on various campaigns, foreign lands and peoples. I was much more enthalled by the Rome-centric approach of the first book and quite often became board by the second. In fact, once I hit about page 400, I had to start skimming paragraphs and I only chose to read the parts that directly related to Rome. Not highly recommended."
2,You'd be safe stopping after the first book,"This would be good if _I Claudius_ didn't exist, but... when you make the comparison this book suffers. It just didn't feel the same, it was almost like an extremely long ending to _I Claudius_. In many places it read like a history book and of course there was nothing that could compare with the antics of Caligula or the battles with the germans from _I Claudius_.I probably won't give up on Graves, but I wouldn't suggest reading this book."
5,The Story continues,"This is a great sequel and a must read, though it is a very different book from the one it follows. Where 'I, Claudius' was introverted and historical centered, Claudius the God moves into the wider circles of the Empire. This should by no means perturb the reader who came to hunger for the political machinations of Livia or the tawdry depravity of Tiberius in the first novel, this one presents new hurdles and struggles through which Claudius must muddle in order to survive: a wicked nephew, a military uprising, war against Boadicea and two caniving wives.This is the better of the two books, no matter what your interest in them is, and it builds to a truly profound ending.Like other reviewers before me, I urge that anyone who read and enjoyed the characters as represented in these two books: see the miniseries. It may be 12+ hours in length but it is worth it!"
4,Good Book,"Claudius the God is good - I would recommend it to anyone - but it is not as good as the first book, 'I, Claudius'"
5,Classical Fun,"The only quibble I have about Robert Graves' Claudius the God is that is not quite as good as I, Claudius. That, though, is a very high benchmark. This novel covers less of an historical period than the first book and occasionaly some of the battle descriptions cut into the flow of gossip as history, much as they also do in Tacitus. That said, all the wonderful themes and many of the characters (well, the few not poisoned at any rate) from the first book appear to shock and delight. Robert Graves takes the fun and bitchy parts of the classical historians and makes them come to life. His most endearing creation will always be the character of Claudius himself. These books together are a joy for anyone with either a love of history or a need to hear salacious gossip (and often these are two are the same thing). Highly recommended."
4,"Worthy, Worthy Sequel","I was wondering how they were going to handle the final half of the Claudius series, because the narrator dies (historical fact, not spoiling.) How he ends up like his predecessors, most notably Augustus, is very captivating. Tragic, ironic, dramtic and very interesting, I found it to be great, but read the first book first, it will help you understand it better."
2,Avoid this bad quality DVD unless you're hard core Sophia and Marcello fan!,"I had been looking for this film for years since it really moved me when I was a younger, particularly the beautiful musical score by Henry Mancini and the photography. This DVD is an insult to the director and the consumer.IF you know Italian you can buy 'I Girasoli'. The quality does justice to the film BUT there are only RUSSIAN subtitles, not even English subtitles or dubbing. Guess we'll have to wait for a re-release."
2,Wonderful movie finally on DVD...,... but of very poor quality. So bad that it makes me think of an illegal copy?!
1,Something of a Bummer,"There is perhaps one good scene in this film--when a smiling and buxom Sophia Loren seems to be spanking someone naked, who turns out to be a window manikin in the window manikin factory where she works. But don't expect the rest of the film to be this witty. In fact, it's hard to understand how a great director like DeSica would consent to have his name attached to this piece of drivel. The plot is melodramatic and predictable, the photography is kitschy, the acting (even Sophia's and Marcello's) mostly wooden--but then who could deliver such melodramatic dialog with any conviction? In addition, the DVD quality is truly execrable. Avoid subjecting yourself to an hour and a half of tedium, and instead see ""Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow"" again . . ."
5,Touching Human Drama in the War Time,"It starts as a comedy, but it turns into a tragic story. So beautiful, gripping..."
5,I really liked this book.,"It's about a little girl named Beany. She hears a story about a dolphin sword that can grant wishes, and then she figures out that the person that owned the sword lived in Porridge Hall, which is where she lives. And she goes up in the attic and she finds the dolphin sword, and it grants her wishes. Her mother is really sick, so she wishes that her mother would be better.I liked it because it was a very good book. It kept leaving me on cliffhangers, so I couldn't put it down."
2,"Dolphin Luck - a good story, but hard to follow","The underlying story of Dolphin Luck is good, but I found it a bit hard to follow. If the story had been told from one character's point of view or if the story would have focused mainly on one character, it would have been easier, I believe, to really understand this book. Instead, the narrator jumps back and forth, following four characters, brothers and sisters, over the course of a few weeks. It was hard to remember which character I was reading about, much less care about the characters, who were not well-rounded. While I am a McKay fan, I had great difficulty when deciding whether or not to continue this book."
3,It is what it is...,"Not bad sound-wise, but gets lousy reception. Might have to invest in an antenna, great."
1,"Great product, until it broke","After owning this for only 2 years, I was very disappointed that the CD player stopped working. The warranty is only for 1 year so I am out of luck. I won't purchase this product again."
3,Good Machine,"We have had a Dream Machine since 2000 and it got dropped and broke. this new Sony Dream Machine with CD player is great, the reception for the radio stations is not as good as the older model. We would recommend it."
3,"As stated - nice sound, short on features","I am bothered by the lack of a battery backup - WHO MAKES AN ALARM CLOCK THESE DAYS WITHOUT A BATTERY BACKUP????Also, as stated, if you aren't looking at the display ""head on"", you can't read it, so when it sits on my dresser, I can't read the time from the bed.Not a bad unit, but it won't work for me long term."
4,"Good, not perfect","We bought a similar CD/Clock radio for less and it was awful. So we put it in our room (it was the CD part that was awful). We use this in our son's room. Its nice bright display was great for those middle-of-the night feedings when I was trying to keep track of time. Big buttons were also a plus. The only downside, there's a slight clicking sound when you play CDs. But overall, it has lasted for 2-1/2 years in my 2-1/2 year old room. We're looking for another one for his big boy room now."
3,Pretty good.,"Clock numbers are impossible to read from across the room. It would be really nice if all Sony clock radios came with a remote control. It's an acceptable item for the price but not a big ""Wow!"""
3,Not so Good,"The function is enough , but i dont recommand it.The size is a little bit big and the button is too small.And the setting is too complicated. When power off, i need to set it again,so it waste a lot of time to do it"
3,Sony Dream Machine if you can see the display!!,"When my 19 yr old GE clock radio broke I thought this would be a great replacement. The problem I am having though is that the display fades out to something totally unreadable if the radio is higher on your nightstand than your head is on your pillow or bed. If you take the radio and plug it in, then hold it at eye level or lower, the display is fine. But if you raise it above eye level, the entire display is one solid green picture, totally unreadable!! The seller replaced it with another, but the same problem exists. Since I have only had it for about a week, everything else seems OK at this point. The lack of a battery backup though is also something to consider if you ever have power outages. It just seems a company like SONY didn't even use common sense when this unit was produced. I am currently trying to return this and purchase a unit that is easy to read and has a battery backup."
4,So Far So Good,Works great so far- just wish it had a headphone jack (we use it at work instead of as an alarm clock).
1,no freakin' battery!!!???,It is inconceivable to me that in 2007 an alarm clock radio would be manufactured without a battery backup. This radio can't even get plugged in: it's going back.
4,I returned it - description not complete enough,"While the sound was great and many options were perfect, one major component for me was not in the product description. I need multiple alarms - one set for school days and one set for weekends - that you don't have to turn on every night. Given that this was not part of the product's system, it didn't work for my situation.So I sent it back."
4,Almost perfect CD Alarm Clock Radio with Digital Tuner,"The alarm clock is great. You can set up to 3 different times for the alarms to go off 1 utilizing the radio, 1 the cd player and 1 the buzzer. The only thing I have found to be quite annoying with it is that the cd alarm function is quite limited. You set a track to play off the cd you have and it will play that track and only that track to wake you up unless you change it. Additionally, when you press snooze it turns it off rather than say pausing it so if you are like me and hit snooze one or two times before waking, it keeps playing the beginning of the one track you selected so instead of pausing the song so you don't hear the same 30 seconds of the intro to the song EVERY time the alarm goes off. Other than that I love it, especially on the weekends when my husband or I have to go to work and the other doesn't or one needs to get up at a different time than the other, you don't need to worry about resetting the alarm time!!!!"
4,Good overall-Great price,"I am generally happy with my purchase. The unit is a bit large and the shape is clumbsy.The Good-Clear sound, well lit display with dimmer & nap feature is GREAT.The Bad-No 2-5-7 feature. The different alarm times have to be turned on/off as needed ie weekday, weekend. I prefer the set it and forget it perk of a 2-5-7 (Timex). Alarm on/off is a little tricky/complexThe Ugly- the volume dial is located near the back-When I picked it up to change the time for Daylight Saving time last week I accidently turned the volume off. My carpool showed up at 6:30 and I was sound asleep!!!"
4,I don't think I paid full price in 2004,"CD has been waking me up 5 days a week for 8 years - getting to choose my own music to wake to - touchdownThe sound isn't Bose but neither is the priceNo battery back up - No headphone plugIt has 3 different wake up times which you can set for all or one to go off.The open/close for the CD is easyThe print on the buttons is too small - resetting the clock is always an adventureDisplay is normal with 3 settings for bright, not so bright and sleep - it looks exactly like the picture you see here"
3,Solid clock-radio,"I've owned four of these models for at least three years now - one at work, one in each of our two kids' rooms and one in the master bedroom.Pros:I like the features and controls on this unit. I've had no problem setting the alarm (waking to either the radio, CD or buzzer), changing CD play mode (repeat, shuffle), setting the clock (including a nice, one-button daylight savings time setting), even without the manual. We use the unit as our morning alarm every weekday with no problems.There's a generous number of radio pre-sets - 10 FM and 5 AM.The snooze button is nice and big.I like the inclusion of weather radio bands, but note that the TV audio bands won't work anymore with the switch to digital TV signals last year.Cons:There's been some reliability issues - one unit completely died about a week ago - no power when plugged in. The one at work stopped playing CDs about two years ago.Three stars overall - start with four, with one taken away for reliability issues."
2,Mine died,"I most always prefer Sony products and aside from not being able to read the time during the night I was pleased with the Dream Machine. It's compact body fit easily on a bedside table and the sound was not bad. However, it died during the day the other day...nothing that I did. It was fine when I got up and when I went to bed it was dead just as if the plug had been pulled. I have plugged it into a couple different outlets and it is dead. I've only had it a year. So disappointed. The Sony dealership charges $89 an hour for service. Not very ecological if I have to go buy a new alarm/music system. I would expect it to last more than a year, coming from Sony."
4,Good Clock Radio and Value,"I recently purchased this unit, which I received undamaged and in perfect condition. The unit works very well, and is a great value. The sound is above average using the Mega-bass. The only drawback is that the volume knob is on the back right side, which is bad if you sleep on the left.All in all - I recommend buying it."
3,Display not visible from down angle,"My nightstand is higher than my bed. If I want to see the time in the middle of the night I have to get up. The 3 brightness levels do not help, they just increase the backlight which does nothing for the actual information on the display. I like all the other features but the inability to tell the time at a glance caused me to send it back."
2,Features are a snoozer,"This clock is pretty expensive, so I was expecting some easy to use features, and at least a weekend alarm. There is nothing easy about this clock, and the features are lacking. For example, once you set the alarm, it is very easy to un-set it, so you need to make sure it is set before you go to bed every night. And the three alarm modes are radio, buzzer, and CD...not multiple alarms that can be set to go off sequentially. Also, the user interface is not intuitive, so I would not recommend this clock for anyone who has trouble setting up a DVD player.The other issue is that is clock is pretty big. If you have a small nightstand, I would consider a smaller cheaper clock."
4,Not bad for the price,"Sony Dream Machine ICF-CD843V. For $36 shipped, it's a great deal. The con side is no backup battery and it's a bit bulky for an alarm clock."
5,A great clock radio,This clock radio is great! I don't use the alarm functions so I can't comment about that. Everything is digital except the volume control. Best clock radio I have ever had!
4,"Fine, but ugly design","This is a fine product, except for the design.It is horrible.It looks like a martian face. The sound is fine, the material also,but I like the symetry and this design hurts my eyes.Quality sound and attractive design are the best, but this radio lacks of good design."
1,CANNOT SET AND THE ALARM BEEPS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT,I NEED SOMEONE TO TELL ME HOW TO SET THE CLOCK RADIO. I PRESS CLOCK ON THE SIDE BUT NOTHING HAPPENS AFTER I PRESS THE UP AND DOWN BUTTONS. HELP!
2,TV sound will go away in February,"I bought this radio some time ago for my kitchen, not as a clock radio for the bedroom, and got this particular model for one reason: that it broadcasts the sound for TV stations.Alas, even though I bought it within the time period when all new TVs were supposed to be enabled for the digital TV signals which will be the only way to receive over-the-air TV after the middle of February, when it occurred to me recently to investigate whether the TV function of my radio will work after the change, I found that no, it will not--the TV sound receiver is analog. I don't think there's even a way to plug in a converter box to it even if you wanted to go to that expense. So the whole reason I bought the radio (and spent the big bucks for it) goes down the tube.Bummer."
3,Never arrived,"The technical description of the product look great, unfortunately it was not longer available. I never received it. :-("
4,near perfect,"After reviewing many units online, this one looked to be about the best. I really wanted to buy the RCA unit with the front-loading CD, but I never saw one that worked in stores, so I waited until I found this Sony unit.Pros: plenty of presets, weatherband, nice display with 3 backlight levels.Con: no battery backup! I already have a UPS, so I just got a long extension cord for that, but a battery backup would have made this unit perfect."
1,Able to set 3 alarm times...all can't wake to radio,"Somewhat deceptive feature being able to set 3 different wake up times. The only problem is, one wakes to radio, one to cd, and the other to the buzzer alarm. My husband and I both like to wake to the radio, which is not an option with this product. We bought it specifically for that feature -- being able to set our weekday alarm time, and not have to constantly change one for the weekend when we have activities with our children. If you don't mind having each alarm set to a different wake up sound, you might like this radio. We were very disappointed."
2,look at the Sony 837 cd clock radio instead...,"...which is already available at the jandr dot com website, don't know why Amazon doesn't have it, I bought mine at Fry's.Anyways this older 843 model is way overpriced, looks ugly, and has a low-visibility backlit LCD display. Its sound is also a bit weaker, my sister has this model and she doesn't even use the wake up to music function because she often will sleep right through it so she has to use the buzzer instead. Which kind of defeats the whole point of a CD and radio attached to your alarm clock, doesn't it?"
1,Not Worth The Money,The Sony Dream Machine has major flaws.The biggest reason that it was returned was because the numbers were impossible to read at night. The dimmer only changed the lime green background and did not improve the contrast so that the numbers would be more visible. The numbers are also small making them even more difficult to see. The unit does not have a battery backup and also does not have a remote even though cheaper units have both of these features.
5,Create radio/CD players,I purchased two of these for our home. We have been very pleased with the performance of both. Very easy to use and clear sound.
2,It's very hard to read the stupid buttons,This clock has some great features such as the TV audio. The darn buttons are practically impossible to read especially in the evening. What a stupid design flaw! I have excellent vision (pity anyone that doesn't) but why would you write in light color on silver? Very disappointing Sony.
4,Sweet & entertaining,"This video features 3 stories, with corresponding words along the bottom, so older kids can try to read along. In the first story, Ernie is so messy that Bert kicks him out of the house! It was just a little bit scary for my 2-year-old son, as Ernie tries to find a place to sleep for the night. Now that he's four (my son, not Ernie!) he has no problem with this.The next story is about Big Bird getting jealous about all the attention paid to Ernie when he gets sick. So Big Bird decides to pretend he's sick, too! I liked this one because it strikes close to home in my family!! Everyone wants to stay home from school when anyone is sick!Finally, Telly loses his doll and spends the story searching for it. He finds out that *everyone* has a doll that they love -- the boys as well as the girls. A nice egalitarian tale."
1,De muy mal gusto!,"La ""Navidad"" significa el ""nacimiento"" del Mesías. Este ""cd"" es uno denigrante a la mujer e insultante a la celebración cristiana. Basura."
1,Useless low quality bag,"After reading reviews, I was very optimistic about this case. When I got it, I was ecstatic. Everything fit just right. I could even fit my 300 mm zoom lens in it...Less than a week later, 3 of the 4 snaps were broken. Pretty much useless case now. It's not nearly as padded as I would like either. About the only thing that makes this bags quality any better than a foldable lunch bag is the dividers for separating the inside."
4,"""Danerous Girls""","This book is about two girls that go out and sleep in a tent. That day they slept all day and when they awoke they found themselves drinking the blood of rabbits.I would suggest this book to someone who likes suspense they, should read this book because it will keep you on the end of your seat all the way through this book. In a rating from 1-5 I would give this book a 4.I would give this book a 4 because ti is one of the best books I have ever read and I will encourage you to read it.One reason why is because I liked this book and there is not many that I really enjoy so if you can find this book I highly suggest you to read it.Another reason is because at the end the girls still have one big secret I won't give it away because I want YOU to read this book and find out what it is so next time your at the library look for this book."
2,Ugh.,"It might be just me but...the way he wrote this one made me queezy. I didn't like how Renz was obsessed with ""His Laura"" I also didn't like how the plot was repeating...Destiny goes and almost dies then livvy does .. then destiny.Boring."
4,A Good Book,Well I am a 12 year old. I just read this book and it was verry good. I would not say it is the best book though. But I would recommend this book to R.L. Stine fans.
2,"Enticing cover, undeveloped story","I would not recommend this vampire book by Robert Lawrence Stine to my teen readers. The characters are not well-developed and, though the plot could be intriguing, there are too many incidents that just do not ring true. The whole family/school scene was not one I could buy into. I think R.L. should stick to writing Goosebumps."
4,A Good Read,"A dark, compelling tale which Stine is famous for. I enjoyed this book, the writing style reminded me of my favorite author, Sherry A Mauro and her paranormal-romance novel, Even Angels Fall with an especially suspenseful final twist to the ending, just like the Stine novels. I look forward to reading more books by each of these engaging storytellers!"
2,Disappointment,"I was really disappointed by this book. I saw the cover and thought it would be super cool. It sounded great... But then I started reading it.The story has a good idea but that's about it. The characters are vastly underdeveloped, the plot is lacking, and the storyline jumps around too much to get you actually involved. I think this book stunk and I was really disappointed.I have read a lot of vampire fiction and I feel that this book was a real let down.I would not recommend this book to anyone. The only reason I would tell anyone about this book is to give them an example of a bad vampire novel."
4,A must have book for the autograph hound !!,"This huge 608 page volume is loaded to the gills with over 50,000 autograph values covering 15,000 names. More than 1,000 facsimile signatures and photos of autographed items are shown. There are numerous chapters of background information that will be of interest and value to experienced autographers as well as novices. This book covers topics including sports, entertainment, music, artists, literary, business, medicine, space, heads of state and much, much more. The index alone is over 70 pages!! It provides accurate pricing, informative insight into market trends and many current topics. A super reference book."
3,Liked His Older Books Better,"A comprehensive autograph catalog but his older books on celebrity autographs were much better. The past books dealt more with the acquisition of autographs and this book, while much larger, is more of a pricing guide. Would have liked to see more samples, more celebrity addresses (if available). The price aspect of this hobby is all relative and changes too much. More sample autographs would be helpful in determining forgeries."
2,Copy of Sanders,"I'm not a fan of monopolies, but in this case, the Sanders Price Guide is the one and only. This book tries to be the ""standard?"" Sanders is the standard in the field, and while ambitious, this book simply doesn't measure up. Good for facsimilies, but that's about it."
4,tapes almost forgotten part three,"oh, the third double album about odds and sods.....if you have bought and listened to the former two, you just know what to expect. if you don't know part one and two there is no reason to begin from this one. but if you liked Scoop and Another Scoop, you can buy this last one, too. warning: there exist another double cd called ""Scooped"" by Pete Townshend, by i don't really know if it's a sum of these three."
4,The Pride of African American History,"The Pride of African American is an encyclopedia fill with brief descriptions of many renowned inventors, physicians, scientist, and engineers. This book is overflowing with facts about African Americans who have shaped this country as well as contributed to the many inventions, cures and conveniences people live with. Authors Donald and Jane Wilson have truly dedicated themselves to the history of African Americans. However, the book lacks an in-depth look into the lives of theses important people. There is only a brief overview of their subjects. This book however is a resourceful tool to use as a reference for further studies of the African Americans. Since reading this book my knowledge of African American, history has been enlightened, and I would recommend this book as important reading material."
3,"Aaron's great, and this CD is good.","OK, I love Aaron as much or more than the next guy, but I was a little disappointed here. His intrepretations of 50s doo-wop (""Orchid in the Storm"") is one one of my favorite recordings of the last 30 years. Producer Joel Dorn and N.O. arranger Wardell Quezergue capture not only Aaron (""I can sing the phone book"") Neville, but the absolute essense of the songs. Stewart Levine is a good producer, but his direction to his arrangers leave a whole lot to be desired. LA sessioneers don't really do-the-do here. The songs *are* great, Aaron *is* great, the CD is good. Get it, but don't rush."
5,Bring It on Home: The Soul Classics,"This is a wonderful CD. My friend took my first one, so I had to buy another one.It truly is a classic."
5,Liquid honey....,"is Neville's voice. I recently saw him at a local venue, where he performed a lot of the music on this fine CD. I hadn't purchased any Neville music since his great jazz memories album, ""Nature Boy"" -- but I went right out and bought this. Neville's not afraid to remake Sam Cooke or Percy Sledge, and his take on ""Stand By Me"" and with Chris Botti's trumpet on a new mix for ""Rainy Night In Georgia"" permeate your thoughts and just about make you forget the originals. Neville did this CD as a tribute to Katrina victims, and his own family's difficulties as the result of the storm. A consummate performer, with a voice that just doesn't quit, Neville is even more at home with sould classics than he is with gospel or jazz. Run, don't walk, to buy this CD!"
3,Good.... but he's done better,"Aaron Neville is the most soulful singer of our time. The collection of songs chosen for this CD is a good collection. However, the arrangements could have been better.His previous version of 'A Change is Gonna Come'is much better than this one, at least I think so. In fact, his previous versions of 'Sittin on the Dock of the Bay' and 'Ain't no Sunshine' are much better also.Not that these aren't good, they're just softer in tone as is this whole CD, so the songs blend well in succession.Aaron is definitely timeless, as are these songs. And this CD is a worthy buy. However, I much prefer 'The Grand Tour' and 'Warm Your Heart' to this CD. 'Nature Boy' was also very well done as far as standards go. Just stating personal preferences."
5,I just love Aaron Neville,"It is hard for me to rate an Aaron Neville disc, because I just love the way he sings. It is very hard to find a song by him that he kills. And in this CD he took GREAT classic soul songs and sang them his style. Just wonderful!"
4,What's in Ned's Head,"The game is alot of fun. It does get boring after a short time however. The articles are adorable. Kids love the dirty diaper, Ned's lunch etc. 10 extra cards are provided for more items to be added to Ned's head which is nice."
5,Different is Good~ A+,Wow who ever thought of this has a great imagination!If you don't have a sense of humor this game is NOT for you.I just love to play this with my daughter it gets the whole family laughing!
5,Weird but Lotsa fun,We play this game with my 11 year old daughter. There is always lotsa laughs and we even made some of our own gross stuff to find in Ned's Head. It is just plain fun.
4,Lots of fun!,"This toy seemed kind of gross at first, but my 5 yr old son LOVES IT!! I especially love that it comes with blank cards so you can create your own items to find in Ned's head. I do not like that after we opened the toy getting it back in the box was impossible so we have ours stored in a garbage bag. Now it's almost like out of sight out of mind. When he looks for a game now he just moves the black garbage bag out of the way and chooses another game to play with. I definitely recommend this toy I just wish there was an easier way to store it after each use."
4,Quick Game for Busy Moms to Play with Kids,"I enjoyed playing this game. Set up is easy, you can add things and the under 4's love it. My five year old finds it easy to feel for the objects and usually wins within the first 5 minutes. Game Over. Perhaps by adding more unusual objects it would be more challenging but just the objects that the toy comes with, can be a quick win for a bright 4-5 year old.When my girls ask me to play with them. I pop out Ned's Head and play for about 5-10 minutes (which is about as long as it takes to remove the objects). My girls are happy I played with them, and I can get back to whatever I was doing before."
5,We love Ned's Head,"This game is alot of fun, everyone gets involved with this. Our girls are 3.5 years and cheat by looking in through Ned's ears but it's still fun. We wish it came with more props but it does come with blank cards so you can put in you own items. An adult version is out there also..great idea we love it. Well worth the money- it gets used over and over."
2,kind of boing,"My kids (3 boys ages 4,6,8) played the game about 3 times- initally they loved it because we got to talk about gross stuff (ear wax, vomit, etc) but after playing about 3 games with it- they declared it ""boring""."
1,this game is just ok,My 7 year old and I just played this game for the first time. It is fun:however we expected neds head to have stuffing so it would be more of a challenge. I think we will enjoy adding some of our own gross stuff. My 7 year old would like to use neds head to decorate a scarecrow. I would think twice before spending the money again.
2,Not nearly as good as expected,It doesn't teach them too much and it's easy to see whats inside the head with out reaching in. Does not hold my sons or my attention to long.
2,Ned's head a little dissappointing,"I was a bit dissappointed with the head as it appears to have some stuffing in the picture, but is basically just fabric over a frame in reality. I imagined a loosely stuffed head that would require some searching for the items, however, once the game has been played it is pretty easy to find the piece by feeling around and choosing what to take out. I purchased this for my 5 year old nephew, and he had the hang of it in about 30 mins of play. The pieces while they sound gruesome, (ie. an icky tooth, and a lab rat) are in fact hard plastic, I think it would have been better if there was differences in the materials some gooey and softer ones that felt more yucky so that kids would have more fun playing, like if it was fun just putting your hand in the head to search."
2,Ned's head,"I was very disappointed in the ""new"" ""What's in Ned's Head"" game. I had seen older versions where the head was stuffed and the children could not see what was inside. This newer version is not stuffed, more like a tent, actually, and my kindergarten students, whom I bought it for, could see the objects in it before actually having to feel for them. I had hoped to use it for letter and numeral recognition games, but it was with great difficulty that we played with the pieces included. I spent money that was donated to my classroom (plus some of my own) to purchase this game and, had I known about the change, would never have purchased it."
2,Don't bother,Thought it sounded cute for my 4 year old and 7 year old. It did not hold their attention very long. I cannot recommend this.
4,Requested and enjoyed by my grandson,He seems to enjoy this game and it is educational. One part (kidneys) got misplaced on Christmas and I don't know if it turned up when they got home. Haven't seen my grandson since Christmas day.
2,poor craftmanship,"Like another reviewer, I also am now on my second Ned game with, well, not exactly ""broken"" stabilizing rods, but permanently bent rods so that the head doesn't ""pop out"" as the directions suggest it should. As a practical matter this means that Ned's Head is not the big puffy thing they show on the box. It's rather a flattened, disfigured head that looks like it's been run over by a truck. You can still make it stand up well enough to play the game, but overall the manufacturing is very, very cheap. I regret that Santa brought this &*^%$#*& thing, and being Santa, now he's gotta make it right."
4,Fun for Five Year Olds,"I bought What's in Ned's Head for my five-year-old grandson. He saw it in a Christmas toy catalog and asked for it. He enjoys it greatly and it is fun to play with him. It comes with some pretend gross things that little boys love at this age- a plastic dirty diaper or plastic vomit, for instance. I liked that it came with reusable playing cards. He explored my house looking for more little things to put in Ned's head. He found things in the kitchen and toy box. Then we used dry erase markers to draw the new items to add to the game. It teaches the children to feel to identify game pieces. They can't use their eyes or other senses, as they primarily do. I was surprised that my 3-year-old grandchild can not play the game without peeking into one of the holes to see the items. There is much laughter and rolling on the rug in happiness while playing."
1,Not Fun at all,We got this game for several age levels from 2-8. No one liked it. It kept their interest for only a few moments. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
2,Paid for a new product. Recieved a used product,The product itself is fine but the box was resealed. I paid full price for a new item but the sender gave us a box with scotch tape holding it together. Don't waste your money on Amazon. Buy the new product at a toy store! Very unhappy.
4,"Older Toy, Easy to find on Ebay",MY Neice had this toy out last thanksgiving and my daughter wanted one for the following Christmas. We looked everywhere in the DFW metroplex for months up until the end of December with no luck;. Amazon had it right away and shipping quickly. <Applause>
1,What's in Thier Head??,"What kind of sick game is this? I mean pulling bugs,food and other nasties out of someone's head and also how did Ned get all those things in his head without killing himself in the first place? Who came up with this game? The Guys who made the Cool World movie? How do you even win let alone lose at this game? I give this game a 0 out of 10."
1,Not as cool as it looks....,"The poor quality of craftsmanship really detracts from the possibility of fun with this game. It is just weird enough to be something the whole family wanted to play with. We were disappointed in the following: Ned's head is polyester stretched over a flimsy metal frame. The fiber filling comes out through the shoddy seamwork. The items one is supposed to ""find"" in Ned's head are beyond cheap: the disgustingly cool looking cotton swab completely fell apart with the first round of the game; the plastic screw is hollow and came crushed; ""the vomit doesn't even have any brown chunks in it!"", exclaimed my daughter.All in all, we were completely disappointed in this game as the potential was definitely there. Play it once and stash it or convert it into a mask for next Halloween's trick or treating!"
3,Questionable durability after 1 game. Kids liked it though.,"We opened this game yesterday on my 5 year olds birthday. The first thing the kids said is that his face has a point in the forehead - the manufacturer put the stablizing rods in backwards (back in front, front in back - it took serious manipulation to switch them around - a 20 minute job). The head is constructed similar to a groovy girl terrific tent (search on amazon), except the front to back rod is separated - I question how much strain the side to side rod can withstand after seeing 8 year olds with both hands in this thing. The point of the game is to find the object on your card. After one single game's play, the cards are pretty much trash. They didn't use very thick cardstock for the cards. Our other pieces haven't yet collapsed as in the previous reviewer. I have concerns that this game won't make it through the next play."
4,"It's Cute, Its' Fun.. doesn't hold attention long for a toddler! I would still Buy for the Smiles & Giggles your Toddler Gets","This is cute, fun, makes ur little one laugh/smile/giggle the whole time playing! I myself even can't stop laughing as Iam having to dig in Ned's nose or ears! The toys inside Ned are really creepy, funny, and gross.. My 3yr old just thinks its awesome! I do think Ned is a good buy for the money(worth the price)..he is not flimpsy, holds well( Like I stated I have a 3yr old boy, who throws him around, digs him all the time, stuffs his little toys in Neds Head..& Ned still looks new!)..It doesn't keep his interest long though, & its a great thing for education to help motivate/understand/follow directions trying to make him flip a card & dig for what is on the card(U can make ur own game up also!)..but he does love to stuff his toys & carry Ned around..so it's worth every smile:)"
2,Should've made it myself!,"Not a big hit, really. It would be just as good to take a bunch of small toys or things around the house-put them in a bag or box- and take turns trying to find the particular item just by feel. It would have the same benefits, probably better quality, and just as much appeal (probably more because my kids found it more amusing to find things to add to Ned's Head- than actually playing with Ned's Head). I guess for the price I shouldn't complain- but now I have ANOTHER toy collecting dust on the shelf."
5,"So funny, it hurts","If you can, enjoy this in glorious HD.This movie is super crazy fantastic amazing; probably in the top five funnies films ever made."
5,Hilarious,i watched it last night and i couldnt stop laughing. some of the things that are done are just stupid but others are funny as hell. the whole dancing with the girl part in the movie was just so funny i couldnt stop laughing for 10 minutes. buy the movie. its great!
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","I'm sure I'll get trashed for this, but I saw the advance screening of this movie and I was disappointed. It came out of the gate, BLAZIN' for the first 30 or so minutes and then it just lost it's way. I literally didn't stop laughing for the first 30 minutes and then it's as if it ran out of gas in the middle and had to be pushed to the end, not before getting all sappy and weird. Don't get me wrong, there are laughs throughout, but it started off so strong, I kind of expected more and didnt get it."
3,SuperOK at best,"""Superbad"" is a decent movie about two inseparable high-school seniors who were planning to go to Dartmouth and be roommates there. One, however, doesn't get in (not a spoiler, by the way) while the other does, so they know they won't be around each other much in coming months. In addition, they both cultivate relationships with girls, putting an added strain on their own relationship. The movie's at its best until about halfway through, when two police officers (one played by Seth Rogen) enter the story. The addition of the two cops takes the somewhat amusing rite-of-passage storyline of ""Superbad"" into mediocre comedic territory, which is to say that the cop scenes are neither believable nor funny and detract from the main storyline. Although I enjoyed much of the movie, I can't say that it ever motivated me toward laughter."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Superbad is two films warring with each other: a stupid, sophomoric comedy with dumb characters (like the two bumbling cops) and gross-out humor aplenty, and a smart coming-of-age story about two well-developed and realistic teen characters; it's an unholy alliance and the movie suffers as a result."
2,Overrated,"I'm at a total loss as to why this film did so well at the box office. Unless the use of profanity every other word is funny and I'm just too far over the hill to think so. This film was average at best. If it wasn't for the kid who changed his name, the film would have been a total bust. However, the most shocking thing that happened to me during this movie is my 19 year old wanted to leave 15 minutes after it started because she felt is was both gross and stupid. I'm glad others enjoyed it. I guess that's why we go see for ourselves instead of just listening to what others think. :)"
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of ""Knocked Up"" and relished the moment to see Superbad but unfortunately it failed to live up to my expectations. There are some funny and realistic moments that resonated with me and you could probably do worse things with your money than spend it on this movie, but I left the theatre thinking this was just a self-indulgent exercise for a couple of talented writers. Basically, it was a feel-good movie for geeks and dweebs: they are marginalized and can't get anywhere with the ladies or popular crowd but in the end obtain some measure of justice and popularity by 'scoring' with a couple of hot chicks at a party. I didn't find the movie to break much ground excpet perhaps the graphic nature of the sex jokes. Finally, the scenes with the police were just silly beyond belief and seem lifted out of Police Academy flicks."
1,One of Worst Movies I Ever Saw!,"Super Bad was one of the worst movies I ever saw. Even given that it's a stupid, sophomoric attempt at humor - which I often like, I found it exceedingly banal. Everything about it was terrible: the script, writing, acting, cinematography. If I could give it less than one star I would."
3,Swearing from the beginning till the end + Some hilarious moments = worth renting,This movie contains swearing from the beginning till the end. That really irritated me after watching it for 15 minutes. It has some hilarious moments. It's worth renting
1,"Simply put, a complete waste of time.",It was just not funny. Not clever. A struggle for genuine humor. A complete waste of time. A star rating is required to post this review. I would have rated it no stars if it was allowed.
1,"NO Redeeming Qualities, painful to watch","I had heard that this movie was an instant classic. The word was that this was a highly entertaining and consistently funny movie. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay to see this movie. I thought the entire film was very poor due to the plot and the cast of uncharismatic actors.I was still waiting for the funny parts by the end of this film. I liked ""Super Troopers"", it was definitely not the most mature movie but that was some of it's charm.This movie seemed like it was written by 13 year olds for other 13 year olds. Absolutely awful.The jokes were almost directly plagiarized from ""American Pie"" (which I also thought was a waste of time) they both had no redeeming qualities."
1,S U P E R B A D !!!,"Yep, title pretty much sums up this turkey. Only teens would titter at this juvenile garbage."
4,"GREG MOTTOLA, OPUS 2","**** 2007. Produced by JuddThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Widescreen Edition)Apatow and directed by Greg Mottola. Two friends must absolutely find alcoholized beverages in order to impress and seduce the girls who invited them to a party. Wow! At last, a smart comedy about American teenagers and the way they deal with sexuality. Just scratch the varnish to find one or two truths very well observed. Highly recommended."
4,High school geeks almost party,"This movie is one of those teen coming of age moviesfor a triplet of geeks. There is booze and drugs andwild cops who are a dangerous as the bad guys.Somewhat crazy, but no where do we mistake this fora reality. It reminds me of a friend who was reallytrying to get some in high school and batting zero.I think it was harder 40 years ago, but I doubtpeople have changed all that much.Some really strange and funny things happy in this movie."
3,"not superbad, but not supergood either","Honestly, Superbad is a movie created directly for teenagers, and no other age group. The type of jokes, the very very obvious theme of the storyline, and the constant bickering between the characters talking about said subject... this is a movie created for teens. Nothing more needs to be said. So is the movie GOOD? I guess it's alright, but as an adult watching it, I had the feeling I was too old to be watching something like this so my overall opinion is somewhat mixed."
3,Genuine and funny until....,"This was a genuine and hilarious comedy right up until the 'cops' entered the movie. Before that, it was a believable slice of 3 'nerdy' high schoolers lives. When you combine the realness with the funniness of the script and great acting jobs of the three guys, this could have ended up a really good classic 'coming of age' movie...unfortunately, Seth Rogan and the other guy playing the cop enter the movie and take the whole thing from sweet and genuine to complete farce, by portraying two 'boobs as cops' and takes the wind right out of the movie. Granted, there are still some hilarious scenes afterwards, but the over the top farceness of the cops stripped the movie of the element of realness that was so great before they entered. Still some gut busting funny scenes though. 3 and 1/2 stars."
3,Two homosexual friends discover love for each other against the mainstream.,"A very funny coming to age movie with a twist. The two main characters through all their trials and tribulations trying to get laid finally discover they are very much in love with each other.Still in denial the movie ends with each going in separate directions (with girls) but looking longingly at each other.Two high school boys always out of the mainstream and not quite ready to come out of the closet, they will give the ""strait"" life more time.The cops a freakin hilarious!I cant wait for the sequel!"
4,Funny but....,"The beginning of the movie was very good and funny, towards the middle it was boring and too long. But it's worth seeing (but it's not as funny as the ""Knocked up"" or the ""40 yr-old virgin"")"
4,Comedy Classic for the 21st Century,"""Superbad"" goes right along with the comedy classics of past generations. Whether thinking about the booomer's ""Animal House"", ""Caddyshack"" or ""Christmas Vacation"", ""Superbad"" will be generation ""Y""'s equivalent. A must-see for anyone born in the last 20 years, it will resonate with anyone who is open minded enough to remember just how painfully funny adolescence was."
2,sUpErBaD,It'd be okay to rent but not worth it to purchase. Not as humorous as the preview let on and cursing was a little excessive.
2,Not really great,"I'm pretty okay with profanity and even vulgarity, plus after the raving reviews my family gave me about this movie, I expected more. To me, it just wasn't funny. Although I love the character McLovin because he is so weird, I still wouldn't see this again nor buy it on DVD. I gave it two stars because there were a few parts that made me chuckle or smile, and I did think it clever the many manifestations of a certain male part Seth had drawn, however, that was it. I guess it just is not my type of humour."
1,*insert clever parody of movie title here*,"After hearing a lot of hype about this movie, I finally took the time to watch it. I love movies like There's Something About Mary, Dumb & Dumber, and even the Toxic Avenger movies (just to show you the level of humor I like)... however, I don't think I laughed more than once during this entire movie. Even then, it was a weak, forced laugh out of sympathy. The movie seemingly had no story whatsoever and it bored me to death. I really couldn't have cared less about the characters. A plane could've crashed on them and killed them all and I wouldn't have cared. Actually, I think I would've cheered because it would have signaled an end to this mess.I can't imagine why this is considered such a funny movie. It's nothing but three obnoxious, stupid teens trying to get alcohol. Just stroll on down to your local 7/11 and you can see that for free."
1,The movie lives up to it's title!,"This has to one of the worst teen movies I have ever seen!I guess you have to under 30 years to like it.This film seemed as though much thought wasn't given at all.I am a fan good teen movies ,but this wasn't one of them."
1,the biggest waste of time ever,"I enjoyed Juno, and I enjoyed Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, so I thought I'd watch Superbad because of Michael Cera. Especially since it was a big deal for some reason, I mean McLovin shirts and everything? Well I couldn't even wait until the end of the movie to write a review for this horrible movie. It's just ending, thank God. For most of the movie I've been just watching to see if it gets better. It doesn't. I did not laugh once, which is fine- Eternal Sunshine was labeled as a comedy and I didn't laugh, but it's still a great movie- not the case here.Maybe if I were twelve I would have thought this was hilarious, but if I were twelve it wouldn't be appropriate for me to even see this. I can't wrap my brain around these five star reviews. Easily one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in my life. Right up there with ""Out Cold""."
3,"I Finally Realize What A ""Bro-mance"" Is","There's one going on between two misfits seeking alcohol and another between two cops. It's nothing sexual but just acting like a huge dork to get constant approval. The underlying theme is the nerdy teens go from a poor chance of scoring with girls before college starts to a ""fair"" chance. This story has been done too many times before."
5,funny movie,i saw on cable and had to have my own copy. I love the acting in this movie it is funny from start to finish.
4,I was McLovin this comedy,"This was a hilarious movie full of fun characters in the same vein as Fast Times at Ridgemont High or American Pie. The plot follows the lives of two high school seniors who are best friends as they attempt to get with some high school hotties before they take off to different colleges.Some of the funniest scenes in this movie center around the antics of their friend Fogell (aka McLovin) and a pair of keystone cops. One of the cops is played by Seth Rogen who also co-wrote the screen play.If you enjoy stupid humor about suburban kids then you will enjoy this coming of age comedy. If you yearn for something with more substance, then you might want to give it a pass. I for one enjoyed this movie enough to watch it three times, and laughed at every joke the third time through."
4,Unrated - It's Just A Word,"I'm not going to go into depth about the movie, you've probably seen it already. I just want to say the ""unrated"" material is nothing shocking and really not enjoyable. The extra footage they add to the movie really changes the tone of the movie and you'll likely be wishing you bought the theatrical version."
1,SUPERBAD--MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY,"This movie is so BAD. So very BAD. In fact, it's SUPER BAD. Not funny. Just HORRIBLE. I could not get through the whole thing. TERRIBLE. ONE OF THE WORST EVER."
2,I didn't enjoy it as much as other Apatow films,"I didn't really like this as much as Knocked Up or 40 Year Old Virgin; it just didn't hit the mark for me. However, if you like this movie and are wondering about the quality of the streaming video, that was great. It worked very well and the picture was nice and clear."
4,"If you liked the movie, get the DVD for the extras","Superbad is not to everyone's taste, as evidenced by ratings that are all over the place. I was one who liked it. It's not a perfect movie but there were many scenes that had me laughing out loud: Jonah Hill's ""DTF"" conversation with Michael Cera, the weirdo guy they hit with their car (""A little of this, a little if that""), and Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as inept cops.Lots of great bonus features, in particular a montage of Hill's ad-lib line readings, make this a must-have for fans of the movie."
5,Super.. GOOD!,I love this movie. I wanted it as soon as possible and that is exactly what I got. Great purchase!
4,classic teen comedy,"Good all around humor, acting, and story. The movie was meant to be a lighthearted and silly, so don't expect anything overly deep. I find it similar to American Pie in story and silliness."
4,McLovin rules,"McLovin really steals the show from those other two guys on the cover. Jonah Hill's character is sheer vermin in this film, but his character gets what he deserves. Loads of laughs, but not something I'd watch in front of anyone with a shred of decency (not that I associate with those types of people anyway). Cool bonus feature seeing my heroes Bootsie Collins and Bernie Worrel, although somewhat boring."
4,A good but not great comedy. Still recommended,"Superbad is a good movie that goes along with other movies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin or American Pie. Although I believe Superbad aren't as good as those other two movies, it's comparable and it gave me enough laughs that are good enough for me to recommend this title to comedy lovers.As for picture quality, I would rate it a 4 out of a 5. For a comedy, I think it looks good but it doesn't look as good as the other recent releases on Blu-ray. The picture isn't as sharp as it should be. Sound would also be a 4 out of a 5 since there isn't a wide range of sounds, but then again this is a comedy and it's perfectly fine."
5,One of the Funniest Movies I have seen in long time.,As long you're not easily offended then this movie will make you laugh a lot. Ridiculously smart and dumb at the same time.
5,Super Good,"This is a wonderfully funny flick! My Godchild kept insisting that I watch it. I finally gave in and watched it, and now I'm hooked!!! Without giving anything away, just know that you will walk away a fan of this movie, as well. I promise ya! Check it out and enjoy! You'll then end up like I was - on Amazon ordering your very own copy!"
4,Superbad umd movie,The movie was great but i expected it to come in a normal umd (Universal media disc) case but instead it came in a carboard sleeve. No scratches on the disc so it was o.k.
1,"Super bad, unless you're a teenage boy","I tried to watch this with an open mind, knowing that it was a teen movie, meant to be crude and awful and appeal to teenage boys.I should have skipped it. It was crude and awful and will probably appeal to teenage boys, but didn't to this twenty-something woman. The only really redeeming aspect about the whole thing is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Then again, I'm not sure how it could take itself seriously. At all."
3,interesting,"caught this movie during the week and the music was slamming first of all. the two buddys were tight and it was a typical buddy,buddy film about having a good time and a time period thing. it had some funny moments and then it got a bit long in some areas. some things were cracking me up especially Mclovin and the two cops that was funny. it's pretty good and reminds me of a few other films in the same vein."
1,super-unwatchable,"annoying. predictable. dumb.We have seen American Pie series, about teenager's life.This ""movie"" is a giant step back. Simply sucks.Full of ""beep"" words, this is not enough to make it entertaining."
1,"horrible, just horrible","This movie basically sums up all that is bad about our society. I found it completely unwatchable.It is not just lewd and vulgar but demeaning to men, to women, to humanity.The plot is asinine, the dialogue gross and not funny.I can appreciate bawdy humor as much as the next person. There's lots in Chaucer. But this demeans the intelligence of all who watch it.Far from aspiring to be our best selves, this movie glorifies our worst selves.I would be depressed if I thought this movie represented the next generation. Fortunately, I know from my own kids and their friends that it represents only the worst of their generation -- not the best, not even the average."
1,Super-Vulgar and Boring.,"I love a good comedy. Toilet humor, belching, farting, sex, teen issues. All good. Cursing is fine too BUT NOT EVERY 2 SECONDS! I have to ask. To what end was the F word used in every sentence??? Not even Tony Soprano says it THAT MUCH!But then I figured, OK, maybe the funny parts will kick in and make it all worth it. Wrong again. There was one 2 second funny part in this whole miserable piece of schlock.I don't know from what planet people think this was good. I laughed more during Hostel.............Exactly."
1,Baaad,This was filled with profanity and sexual situations.Couldn't watch it with anyone else in the room.
3,My husband liked it,Just another one of those guy movies. My husband liked it but I could care less.
5,oh my goodness..,McLovin' is BEYOND DESCRIPTION! Gave to my 13 year old son per his unrelenting request. PERFECT FOR ANY TEEN. Completely inappropriate and stupid. He and his friends laughed through the ENTIRE MOVIE. WOW
2,Very few funny moments,"The teen comedy has really gone down hill. Since 'Napoleon Dynamite' we've been deluged with very average films that are labeled genius b/c of a few catch phrases or gross images. The whole genera is a ripped off and extremely dumbed down series of 'Rushmore' remakes. 'Superbad' is right there with the rest of them. You laugh a few times, but mostly it's just woooden acting mixed with overemotive acting, mixed with tired nether regions humor. McLovin is not funny. The big fat kid is terrible and certainly not funny. The other kid is great in 'Arrested Dev,' but in movies seems to languish in his own quicksandish personality. I don't know if it's a bit or not, but eventually he'll need to branch out from the same guy we laughed at....how many years ago? Look, I'm as big a fan as anyone of nether regions humor, but it's a craft that seems to have been lost. This movie is generally boring."
5,awesome movie,"how come people always give good reviews on a bluray or hd dvd movie concerning if the movie is good or not,but always forget to mention about the picture quality of the movie.by the way awesome movie and picture quality."
2,i guess if you're a fan of clerks 2,"If you liked Clerks 2 then you will probably like this one. These days instead of great dialogue to carry a movie it is now just swears and over the top gross jokes. I'm no old man but these movies just phone in the ""comedy"" most of the time. ""There's Something about Mary"" had the right idea w/ subtle gross humor but made it funny dialogue also. After that it seems that movies like this just get churned out at the mill To give 15 min of funny lines a 90 minute vehicle."
3,"""Don't Make This Weird, Sing""","The '07 release `Superbad' is yet another in a very long and ever growing genre of outrageous teen coming of age films. Be prepared for the usual foul language, off color sexual banter, lots of alcohol consumption, Neanderthal behavior by every male in the movie, except for the shy and likeable Evan (Michael Cera) and loose women out for a good time. You know, all the usual ingredients necessary in a movie dealing with teen angst and the ""Rites of Passage"" in attaining manhood.With all that said I now must admit that I enjoyed the film. It's actually quite funny throughout, the cast is solid and it's rather quite tame on the gross meter so I didn't feel too guilty watching. By the way, there is no nudity so if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed.My Rating: -3 Stars-."
4,LMAO!,"If you liked the raunchy comedy of ""40 Year Old Virgin"" & ""Knocked Up"", then this movie will delight you. It's the American Pie version of the other Seth Rogen movies.Synopsis:Two best friends are about to graduate high school and have one heck of a night before going off to separate colleges.This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Period."
4,"Profane, Childish, Charming All at Once","Nice little story line about 3 friends in transition in the waning days of High School. Of course, since they are teenaged boys there is no shortage of foul language and crude sexual references. But it seems pretty authentic rather than obligatory. Bottom line, I really enjoyed the story - and the slow exposure of the truth of the relationship between Seth and Evan."
2,Superbad = Superhyped,"During the weeks before Superbad I was honestly looking forward to it. The previews and TV spots for it made it look like a hilarious movie...then I saw it and I was extremely disappointed. This is just one of those Adult Comedies that kids who can't even drive yet go to see and think people like ""McLovin"" are cool. While there were a few parts that did make me laugh, I thought it was trying too hard to be funny. Basically, I think this movie has been overly-hyped.Now if you want to see something funny, rent Hot Rod when it comes out. I thought this was x10 funnier than Superbad."
1,Super-hyped,"I would have to say that SUPERBAD was SUPERHYPED. Overall, I didn't find this movie funny at all. I mean, look at its premise: a few nerdy guys try to get liquor in order to crash a hip teen party. Very big deal. If this is what teen comedy flicks have been reduced to then that's not saying much for our society."
1,I am warning you,"I know what's gonna happen. You're feeling a little depressed, a low-level malaise, you can't handle watching something that would impress anyone, you don't want a movie about a suicide with little dialogue or even French new wave or Woody Allen, you just want something that will have barely any effect on you except for making you laugh.Do not watch this movie. It's more depressing than a well-meaning movie about poor workers, believe me. I admit I only watched the first three minutes. But that's because I've watched a lot of Judd Apatow movies now, and so I know what to expect. And if it starts off being incredibly offensive and poorly observed and lacking in actual gags, it's not going to IMPROVE. Some Apatow movies do have some good observation in them, some good jokes, even, I guess, but you can just tell with this one ...I have warned you."
1,Very Unsatisfied!!!!!,"The movie itself is awesome!! But I ordered this on May 2nd, it was shipped May 4th and it is now May 15th and NO movie. I paid for 3-5 day shipping. I actually bought 300 and I Am Legend AFTER I bought this and used the FREE shipping and they got here 4 days after i bought them. Amazon's shipping sucks, bad!!!!! and I can't figure out how to contact them to tell them I want my movie I paid for. Like I said, this movie is good, I am just complaining about the shipping."
1,Strike 2,"So I ordered the Superbad DVD and put it in to watch it and it did not work. The company didnt respond when I ask them about. After I wrote a bad review did I get any response and I was pleased to see that they were sending me another dvd. Unfortunatly they sent me another DVD that did not work. I know it is not my player because it plays other dvd's fine and one of the Superbads I got was a dual disc and the bonus feature dvd played. This company must not check their dvds before they send them out even though they mark them as ""like new"" because every new dvd i have had PLAYED THE MOVIE! Very unhappy, I do not recommend buying from this company. I understand a slip up, but twice in a row, something must be wrong. Dont waste your money like i did."
3,Who's who in movies?,"What do Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Seth Rogen (eww), Jonah Hill (eww), & Bill Maher (eww) ALL HAVE IN COMMON?Hint: They are blood brothers with Adam Sandler, Larry King, Jerry Seinfeld & Jon Stewart for example. Give up? They ARE ALL JEWISH... Who knew? I didn't. Simply AMAZING...Search for: An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood."
4,The funniest movie I've seen in a long time,"Superbad has got to be the funniest movie I've seen in forever. I laughed out loud more times than I could count, and actually found myself wiping away tears at one point. This movie encompasses all of the funniest aspects of teenaged boy humor, and that being said, it probably isn't for everyone. Teenaged boys are annoying, crude, without guile, and often have no filter. If you can't tolerate talk of sex, drugs, booze or any other thing that an 18-year-old boy is likely to have on his mind, you probably will be unable to countenance this film. But if you can take a joke for what it is--humorous--without getting all riled up, I'm sure you'll enjoy this hilarious film."
4,SuperGross,"Look, I'm a fan of Judd Apatow. I thought Virgin and Knocked up were well done and gross at times, but Superbad is about the grossness. Grossness is the star of this coming of age, let's get laid film. Skinny, likable Seth and fat, gross joke a second Evan are going to separate colleges in the fall and it's the last weeks of high school. The girls are throwing a big bash with the parents conveniently out of town and...In the process of providing the booze for the kids, a prestige move, the boys and their pal Fogel, the nerdiest superbad wannabee with oversized goggle glasses, end up at wild parties, police chases, and women's plumbing situations. I'm an old guy and the relentlessness of the gross-out shook me. Hell, I went to the original Woodstock, but once wading in, I found myself laughing aloud on occasion."
1,SuperCrap,"This movie is purely over-rated junk. It gave a few chuckles altogether, but it was dull, the jokes were the same throughout, the story was bad, the characters were lame, and ultimately is a bad movie."
1,What the....?,"This was one of the most overhyped, unfunny, disgusting, juvenile, and pathetic attempts at humor I have even seen. It's an absolute waste of time!"
1,PASOLINI for the masses?,"IF this is common fare for our brain-numbed tweens and teens - why not double-bill this 24/7 with ""SALO"" - same premise - different period???"
3,Super Bad,Bought for my 27 year old son. Not recommended for young children do to bad language and sexual content.
4,Great Movie,"I just got finished watching this movie. I laughed all the way threw it, it reminded me so much of High School."
4,A cut above most of the genre,"As others have noted, ""Superbad"" follows in the footsteps of countless ""last party of the senior year"" movies, and relies on many of the standard situations. It rises above much of the genre, however, by throwing in a couple of over-the-top cops, and through well-tuned dialog among the three teenage buddies. If you don't mind a lot of bad language (and countless humorous drawings of penises) ""Superbad"" will keep you laughing fairly constantly."
5,Juvenile boy humor but sweetness at the core,"Similar to the 40-Year-Old Virgin, Superbad gives us that interesting combination of juvenile boy humor, potty mouths, and sexy girls, but a fundamental sweetness and harmlessness at its core which makes it more palatable. Still not recommended for seniors, but anyone under 55 or so might find it amusing.The three relatively unknown actors who star in it are likeable schlubs who want to impress the girls they crave by getting them alcohol even though they are underage. Also, there is the not-too-dynamic duo of Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, who play two of the most useless but also funniest cops you've ever seen. They manage to complicate things for the trio as they go on their quest for alcohol.If you're looking for some good laughs without violence and gore, go for this."
5,Must Have,"I saw this movie 3 and a half times in theaters (the half the time I saw Good Luck Chuck, then went into Superbad in progress). Much better than 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. If you buy one comedy this year, this is it."
5,Michael Cera is Hysterical,"This is one of the funniest teen films to come out in a long time. So many stupid films in this genre, such as American Pie and its sequels, made me think twice before going to see this one. I'm glad I decided to chance it. Michael Cera, of Arrested Development, makes the film. His comic timing and awkwardness adds a new level of comedy to the movie. Yes, it's about sex, there's vulgar language and nudity, but this movie goes far above and beyond the slapstick body humor of American Pie and 40 Year old virgin. Buy it!!! You won't be sorry."
4,as expected,It's a mouse pad.. For the price you can't go wrong. It's a cheap mouse pad. I needed one when I purchased a glass desk and realized that a laser mouse does not work on top of it. They do sell the same items in stores for double or triple the price.
1,Not compatible with my mouse,"It doesn't work well at all with my optical mouse (Logitech MX900); the cursor jumps around, and doesn't move smoothly."
1,Too thin,"This mouse pad is too thin. The advertised Product Dimensions are wrong and said that it's 0.2"" thick but it's really 0.125"". I purposely bought this for the thickness so this is very disappointing.The other Product Dimensions are wrong too. Amazon says 9.5 x 8 but it's really 9.125 x 7.875.How does this happen? Either they're sending us a different product than the advertised one or they don't know how to use a ruler. Either cause is bad.Update: I should have used the mouse pad before I reviewed it. Now I know it has a more serious flaw. The top surface is made of a soft fabric. This has two problems:1) It takes way too much effort to move a mouse on it (maybe it would be okay for a roller-ball mouse, but I have a laser).2) This fabric attracts dust like a magnet and it's really hard to brush the dust off."
5,good old fashioned mousepad,"I have purchased several mousepads over the past year, with all kind of space age finishes and coatings. I hated every one of them and just went back to my shabby, old, falling apart mousepad because the new ones didn't work as well. This mousepad is just like my old one, just a bit thinner. A good surface that is easy to move the mouse on, pretty color, good size. Finally, I found a replacement for my torn up and ancient mousepad!"
5,"very faint ""new mousepad"" smell","works well with my Verbatim mouse, dimensions are as described .0125x8x9"", with only a very faint, sorta neutral ""new mousepad"" smell."
5,Great,"For the money this is a great mouse pad. Clean, good size, and doesn't smell. Lazer Razer Naga mouse works perfect with this."
5,Great Mouse Pad,"I wanted a thin full size mouse pad for traveling. Something that is light weight, fits into a carry bag without taking up a bunch of space, I can fold it, roll it up or whatever and this baby fills my needs exactly. Plus, the mouse glides easily. I can also use it to set a hot cup of coffee on it while sitting at someone else's fine desk. Perfect for me."
1,Solenoid Valves/Pneumatic Actuator Design Hand Book,I have been searching the above books since 4 internet hrs on your site.. kindly let me know if it is available with you...
2,Fruit Fun,This was an adequate product. Not quite what I expected but had enough info to get me started
4,elrond,a must buy if your a fan of the lord of the rings you will like this oneit came right on time and was worth it.
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this set for $69 now it's priced at $49. Not good. The stainless is the cheap stamped out stuff, very light weight. I had purchased a similar Oneida pattern several years ago for my parents and it was beautiful. This is not the same quality. You can't tell from the picture which set is which. I'm very disappointed."
4,Appealing Flatware for the Price,"This flatware has a mix of satin and shiny finishes and is medium light in weight. The set is attractive for entertaining and so far seems to be pretty durable.When I received this set in the mail, I had anticipated it to be a little heavier, which was slightly disappointing based on the appearance via the web.Overall, I think it is a decent buy for the quality and the price."
3,This disc was below expectation,"If you are Andy Williams fan, you will be happy that this disc delivers a repertoire of his most popular numbers. However, the concert feels lethargic and lacks energy. Although he is still a pretty good crooner, it is noticeable that Andy can't hit his high notes anymore. The disc quality is fair. Most disappointing is the sound track which is in Dolby Pro-logic only."
1,Disapointed with wear,"I have owned Oneida for all of my 30 years as an adult. I have never had knives to tarnish and rust the way these knives have. The rest of the set is in great condition, but the knives look awful.I had an Oneida set from Walmart for 8 years and the knives NEVER tarnished. I purchased my Flight from a better department store and am sick about it."
3,A Nice Set but Nothing Spectacular...,"The reason I purchased this flatware set was for a gift.First of all the design is really nice, which is one of the reasons I bought this set in the first place. My only complaint is that the steel is too lightweight and to me that makes it cheap.I like to have flatware thats classy and elegant as well as heavy to me that adds a look as though its expensive. Although the look is great, the weight could have been heavier adding to the already elegant look.Still its a good set."
3,Why no teaspoons?,"I am very pleased with this set overall but I was disappointed that Oneida doesn't offer any extra pieces other than the big fork and big spoon as serving pieces. I tried to find long teaspoons and slotted spoons to match but had no luck. As it turns out, they don't even make them anymore in their fine flatware either! Select sets offer a large slotted spoon at an extra price but not all of them. I finally found long teaspoons that ""almost"" match from Mikasa but still no luck with slotted spoons!"
2,Disappointed with quality.,"Although I was pleased with the look of this set, the blades of the knives did not hold up. Upon washing, black spots appeared that did not come off and appeared to be some sort of tarnish. I was very disappointed and returned the set. Brand new flatware should not look like that after a week of use."
1,Disappointed with Rust Problems,"We purchased two 45 piece sets of the Oneida Satin Flight pattern about a year ago. We like the style and the feel of the piece as they are not oversize like some other patterns. However, rust spots have been appearing on many of the pieces (in fact all 16 the knifes). According to Oneida, the only recourse is to return the defective pieces and hopefully they will replace with pieces that don't rust, but we are skeptical. Also, we'll be stuck paying to the return these items which will be an added expense.Therefore, we cannot recommend this product."
4,"Nice flatware, but price increase hurts","We purchased this set of flatware back in 2003 for our new kitchen. The quality of the product was fantastic and it has lasted quite well over the last three years.The styling is nice and the durability for the number of washes is impressive. We have since expanded and would like to buy an additional 8 place settings and have noticed that in the 3 years, the prices has more than doubled (even with Gold Box prices). The value of the settings at the original price would have been 5 stars. The increased price, while still an excellent set, puts the set on par with higher quality designed flatware.As to the actual product, I recommend it highly if you can afford the price."
5,And the hits keep on coming!,"Their ""pump action"" grass shears is the latest addition to my Corona Clipper collection, and it's certainly worthy of the Corona name, with the solid heft and smooth cutting action that characterizes Corona's entire line of cutting tools.This thing is remarkable in how handy it is for snipping grass next to the sidewalk, around the mulch beds, next to the house, around trees, along the fence, under the deck, and anywhere else your clumsy lawnmower just doesn't quite get to - and you don't want to grind against with an equally clumsy string trimmer.Granted, it's not the lightest grass shears you can find, but after a couple seasons of buying those chincy featherweight brands, you'll be relived to finally have one that really works and won't have to be replaced ever year. A little oil after each use, and this thing is likely to outlast you!"
3,OK shears,"I works reasonably well. Based on other reviews I was expecting exceptional quality and was a bit disappointed. I could have purchased the same quality shears from Loews, etc. at a lower cost after shipping."
5,Corona Shears; The Ultimate Trim!!,"I purchased these Corona Shears to trim lawn edges for a garden tour. They are excellent and very easy to use. My only suggestion is that I would love for Corona to make them with a rotating handle similiar to Felcro shears. However, the Corona grass shears are the best available."
4,Don't judge a CD by it's cover,"While the CD cover may look a little weird, the CD seems very useful for teaching math concepts! I'm excited to use this CD to teach math concepts in my preschool classroom."
5,Actually 4 1/2 Stars,"I'd pretty much just echo everybody else's praises for this collection, except to add that a HUGE ingredient critical to its success is the presence of Leon Russell. Probably the most distinctive piano player in all of rock 'n roll (his searing keyboard work in ""Going Down"" is every bit as integral to the song as King's playing & singing), and one of the great bandleaders of all time (witness ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen""),he's the perfect sideman for someone of King's stature. Freddie could never coast or else Leon would get the spotlight. Great backup musicians & singers with some killer vocal arrangements too.There's alot of experimentation (early 70's style) that doesn't always work, but that is always gutsy - remember that this is the blues, an idiom not exactly known for being on the cutting edge. This allows for some of Freddie's most aggressive fretwork - where Clapton stings, Freddie slices!!"
5,Excellent Reference,"This is an excellent reference work, filled with easy to follow exercises and tests. You can't have enough grammar books as each has its strengths and weaknesses, I refer to all of them when I'm not sure of something and one of them always has the answer: it's usually this one! There are no tapes available for this book so go to books and tapes published by Georgetown Univ. Press by Kristen Brustad for that level of learning."
2,"A Start, but Inadequate","I am loath to recommend this book to anybody. It seems to fairly dance across the surface of what is in fact a very difficult subject. It certainly tends to make learning Arabic appear to be a lot easier than it really is.Possibly this book will be a useful refresher for the student who already has some Arabic and needs to brush up painlessly. But for a beginner to start here would be a true deception. You certainly can't learn to speak Arabic from this book, but that's not the problem; you can't learn to speak Arabic from any other book that exclusively covers the literary language. The problem is that you can't really learn to read Arabic from it either, except maybe for the selections prepared for this book. If you're serious about learning literary Arabic on your own, start elsewhere, preferably with either Thackston, Cowan or Haywood and Nahmad."
3,It's alright...,"This program seems to be more for a person who has had training in Arabic and needs review. I am a beginner, and all that I've really been able to learn from this program so far is the Alphabet. They don't ""explain"" things a whole lot. Sometimes they just expect you to catch on to things, which is very hard when studying a language like Arabic, because it is completely different from English. I've had this program for a year, and I find it very hard to stay with it because it moves too fast. I plan on buying a computer program to help me, and then maybe I can use this program again one day."
4,Not Quite As Bad,"I'm not a great fan of the ""teach yourself"" series, but this is not such a bad book at all. Given that I have certain advantages (I speak Urdu which has similar script and vocabulary) I find that the book tackles the subject logically and is able to explain some fairly tricky concepts with ease. I don't have the tape ...and I do feel that pronunciation (apart from grammar) is vital in being understood. The transcripts sound fairly authentic however."
2,Not a Teach- Yourself Book,"This book would certainly provide good help to someone who already knows the language. For a beginner, though, it fails to provide an adequate systematic approach. It lacks enough exercises, vocabulary is at an inappropriately high level, many basics of everyday speech are never introduced. I will return to this book once I have mastered the basis of the language but for the time being it contributed nothing to my effort to teach myself Arabic."
5,Much Better Than the Title Suggests,"""Teach Yourself Arabic"" sounds like a hokey tourist phrase book or something. Indeed, the ""Teach Yourself"" series varies a lot, some of the languages are poorly treated, some better. This one is a gem. It is not trivial tourist phrases, but actually goes into grammar, provides good reading comprehension exercises and a fairly well-developed vocabulary. Includes some very useful points like word shapes, a key tool for learning Arabic with its root and measure system. If you are studying Arabic in school, this makes a great supplement. Some of the confusion in textbooks is cleared up here. You need a seperate book to learn the Arabic script, and Awde's ""The Arabic Alphabet"" is the best."
4,Really makes you wonder...,"This is a haunting, mysterious book focusing on Mallory and Irvine, the first men to attempt conquering Everest. Leading you through their story, the novel points out evidence suggesting they made it to the summit, and also evidence suggesting they did not. This will make a good holiday gift for those with good minds for deep thinking. The answer will be in your head upon seeing both sides after completing ""Ghosts of Everest"": did they make it? The mystery will haunt us until we know..."
3,The text runs too far into the gutter.,"Great material but... the text runs too far into the gutter (the fold where two inside pages come together) making the book very, very hard to read. I've never seen a book with this problem. It really hurts the work. Move the text away from the gutter!"
4,Case not quite solved,"This is an extremely good, compulsive read. Many have found the photos in bad taste, but they are another point of interest in a fascinating book which tries hard (and succeeds) to remain faithful to its subject. Where the book falters slightly is in its concentration on the behaviour of the BBC. Whilst it was obvious the team were, perhaps justifiably, peeved with some of the BBC's antics, this proved a distraction from both the main purpose of the expedition and the book. A final conclusion is not drawn as to whether Mallory and Irvine 'made it' or no, but a succession of scenarios is presented and discussed. This, together with a poignant synthesis of what probably happened when they perished is the finest part of the book. In the final analysis, a conclusion cannot be drawn, but one puts the book down feeling that the odds that they reached the summit just improved from three to one against to even steven."
4,Adding a Chapter to History,"This is a great, upbeat narrative about how one person's dream, and a group of sincere, committed (not to mention extremely likeable) mountaineers came together to add a chapter to one of history's most enduring adventure mysteries. The book is well written--paralleling the 1924 and 1999 expeditions interestingly and entertainingly--and incorporates tons of beautiful photographs from both. The team's conclusions are inconclusive, but they came a lot closer to drawing a picture of what may have happened to Mallory and Irvine. I recommend this book highly for people who love a good mystery, adventure, or who are fascinated by Everest.BTW - My book didn't have the above-mentioned gutter problem. Maybe that one was mis-bound?"
5,The Best Book on Mallory I have read.,I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the 1924 expedition and the mystery that surrounds the lost climbers. Great pictures and descriptions of what was found. Also goes into the examination of Mallory face and head which i didnt know had happened. Great Book Buy and Read.
4,A spellbinding story of the Mallory-Irvine mystery,"A wonderfully written and well photograghed and illustrated account of the search for the lost explorers of Everest, culminating in the discovery of George Mallory's body. The thorough research done by Everest historian Jochen Hemmleb was fascinating and instrumental in narrowing down the search area and laying to rest many previous theories about Mallory and Irvine's disappearance.Given the toughness of these early climbers and the shear drive and determination of George Mallory, one can't help but fantasize they made it to the summit.This book is a ""must read"" for any Everest enthusiast and great reading for anyone who loves a true-life mystery."
5,great tool,I have used my lopper for many years for heavy duty cutting of branches and roots. It's a great tool.
3,Corona FL3420,"Corona Clipper FL-3420 I found the Corona Clipper FL-3420 to be a superior clipper. However when trying to find a replacement blade, I could not get the replacement part.This looper performs better than any we have tried. We maintain 25- heavily wood acres in the country. The Corona Clipper FL-3420 would cut a 1 to 1 1/2 inch diameter branch with less effort. I would like to reorder or replace just the blade. Regards, Kathy Ferguson"
3,Blade snapped on new 3420 lopper,"The blade snapped right where it's bolted on (bolt closest to tip of the blade) in the process of trimming a limb approx. 1"" in diameter. This was like the second or third time I'd ever used the tool. When I contacted Corona about a replacement blade they immediately shipped me a new lopper at no charge. Five stars for customer service but one star for product reliability."
3,my own experience with this tool,the first thing that happened was that the two end caps fell off. where? i don't know. but i hope to find them. i really think this is a 1 inch capacity lopper. in my experience there is no way this can cut 2 inches of wood. what kind of wood can it cut 2 inches of? yes it is a great tool but for 1 inch branches or less. i am happy that i bought it but it is for light duty and it does a great job of light duty work. i have been outside clearing a lot of branches and brush and i cannot ever see this cutting 2 inches of anything.
2,Blade breaks easily and expensive to replace,"The lopper is strong, but the lopper blade broke after approx. 2 years of light use on soft wood branches less than 1 inch in diameter. A replacement blade cost $20 plus shipping - the same as a new lopper. Rubber foam handle grips also came loose and slide up and down the handle during use. Grips have to be taped in place periodically to keep them from sliding. Very disappointed in this product."
5,This is What Blues Should Sound Like,"I have to admit that before hearing ""The Birthday Song"" on the local blues station that I had never heard of Sammy Mayfield but that one song was enough to make me track down the man and the CD. Now that I have the entire CD and have had a chance to listen to the tracks I have to say that this guy is good, real good. He can do it all, sing, write and play the guitar. What more could you want from a bluesman? If you like modern day electric blues with strong vocals you will like this CD. I was reading the liner notes and surprissed to see that Mr. Mayfield is out of Denver, Colorado which is not the place you expect to find a strong blues following. In anycase the people of Denver are lucky to have a guy like this and I hope they appreciate the talent in him. I'm in LA and hope he might make it to the South West someday."
2,Sony headphone,"Searched and searched for an on the ear type headphone and hope this was the one. WRONG, they are a real pain to fit and are not comfortable. I guess if you have the perfect ear size and shape it would work."
3,Design Flaws Limit Usability for Sports,"I'd be hesitant to recommend these headphones if you plan to use them for active workouts (running). But they're probably a decent choice for other uses. The headphones produce good sound and are durable enough to survive workout after workout; but I found some elements of their design to be really disappointing. Earbuds fit well (but loosely) in the ear. The over the ear loop is not really adjustable, so I found it hard to get a snug, comfortable fit. Fortunately, the over the ear loop prevents the headphones from falling out; but I did find myself adjusting them frequently. I also found the cord clip to be really disappointing. It was difficult to operate with one hand and it frequently slipped off even when I folded my shirt over an extra time before clipping. Frequently having to re-attach the clip to my shirt while running was a real pain. I don't have this problem with clips on other headphones that have a more traditional alligator clip."
2,Uncomfortable and obtrusive,"I've tried more headphones than I care to admit, and these are definitely near the bottom of the list.The plastic ear clips are hard and too large. I have big ears and they fit ok, but anyone else it out of luck.These are not perfect, but they are much better:Sony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)(also available in several other colors)"
2,There are better solutions out there...,"I've re-read existing reviews with interest - none seem to capture what I experienced with this product. Keeping the $12 price tag firmly in mind, even then I didn't like this earphone. It may be a simple matter of fit, however, I can say that the picture of this product in my ear looks nothing like the picture Sony publishes. There is no way this product fits snugly in my ear like that. The result is that it sits outside my ear, which means the presentation is extremely bass - light. I had to use all of my equalizer range to get it to work. Having done all that, it provided reasonable music for a bike rider, plus I really could hear all of the sounds around me (a plus for bike riders).The best answer for me at least, is the Burton Tech Acoustibuds over my standard earbuds. Beautiful, comfortable, fit. Wonderful music. I am done looking."
1,Junk. A little workout sweat destroyed them.,"Don't buy these. I don't have a problem with Sony, in fact, some of the other Sony headphones (like the MDR-J10) are much better. I used these running outside and at the gym and in no time they stopped working. And they sounded like garbage to start with. Oh, and since I am a forgiving person, I bought a second pair of the same thing to see if the first was a lemon. Nope. It's just a terrible product. They clearly couldn't take the abuse of some sweat. Junk. And they feel awkward. Get the cheaper MDR-J10. Much better. Lasted much longer through the workouts."
3,good,"Wonderfull product, but never wear if you have an ear ache or anything of the like, very painfull."
2,Bad Sound but they didn't cost much,The sound on these earbuds leaves a lot to be desired. I wouldn't recommend these earbuds if you want rich sound. So far they have stayed on my ear but they are a little loose. I have read other reviews of the speaker pulling out of the ear and I have noticed that to some extent but it hasn't been bad. They are sweatproof.
2,"comfortable, but poor sound","The fit is great for wear during running or other exercise, and comfortable enough for extended wear. Unfortunately, the sound quality isn't very good. Even at very low volumes, the majority of female vocals, or any music with a little more treble in it, routinely crackles, distorts, and overloads the 'phones. If you're out jogging and don't want to hear anything but bass, you're probably OK. If you use your headphones to listen to a wider range of music though, pick a different pair."
2,Didn't last long,Buy the cheaper MDR-J10. These are bulkier and don't stay in your ear as well as the J10. The cheap clip-on device for attaching the cord to your shirt makes the headphones slip out of your ear even easier. They last about as well as the J10s that I have owned in the past - they are already starting to fizzle/short out. I have already purchased a set of J10s to replace these when they finally give up the ghost.
1,Not one size fits all,"I'm sure these could be a great product... if they fit. I do not have small ears, and yet, when I hooked these on, the speaker was dangling down around my ear lobe, and while you can adjust the width, there's no way to adjust them to sit higher. I was really disappointed."
2,Not adjustable,"I had a previous set of Sony headphones that I really liked, but decided to try these instead. Unfortunately I discovered they are not adjustable and they just wouldn't stay on my ears."
2,headphone disappointment bad sony,The right head phone was dead out of the box. I should have listened to the other reviews I was reading. I would have thought Sony would have been better. Amazon was great. Refund was easy. Printed prepaid shipping label from Amazon and sent back refund in about 4 days. Great Amazon.
3,Too big for small ears,"I have small ears and these do not sit well in my ears. The sound quality is good, but that doesn't matter much when they constantly fall out of my ears."
1,Not good,"These came with my mp3 player and I hate them.I am an average sized woman and they don't fit in my ears.They are too big.I mostly use them for running and they do not stay in.I have to wear my sunglasses over them to make them ""sorta"" stay in my ears."
3,okay,these are okay. as far as sound goes its pretty flat. the sound is there but theres nothing spectaulor about it. the fit is okay but they hurt after some time. i think the mdrj10 headphones are a whole lot better.
2,Don't fit and sound is really not that great.. :-(,"I was very hopeful that these would be the sports headphones for me, but was sad to find that they did not stay in place on my ears or offer the quality sound I was looking for. As a female, I found the ear pieces too large to hook my ear sufficiently, and they just couldn't stay put on my ears. Every time I moved my head from side to side (even minimally) the inner bud would slip out of my ears or the hook would slip completely off my ear - not good for those long walking/jogging sessions. Also, in my opinion, the sound was really quite ""tinny"" and not as clear/rich as I had hoped it would be. I really expected better from Sony, but I find myself still searching for those perfect headphones."
1,don't waste your money,"If I could give these negative stars, I would. I bought these thinking they'd be great for the gym. WRONG. They continuously fell off, so often it was annoying not only me, but the girl on the treadmill next to me. Not only that, but the ten seconds they did stay on, they bounced around and made a rattling noise so loud, I couldn't even hear the music I was listening to. I highly recommend you forget these duds. I'm going to purchase another pair of Sony h.ear MDR-J20 headphones, which is what I bought these to replace because I slammed the car door on the cord of my original pair."
1,Not a great product would fit on the ear and just fall off,too big for the ear not worth the price or money falls off if you tilt your head
2,So much for the Sports part!!!!,"I have had these headphones for 5 months and the stiff rubber coating is broken and exposing the wires. They sound ok, but from and engineering point of view they are always getting tangled up and the earphones themselves act as little grappling hooks. They are always getting caught on stuff. I commute on the subway every day and I am always wrestling with them. I would not recommend these head phones on a ease of use arena."
4,Great value,"For less than $15, I found this pair of headphones to be a great value. They fit my ears perfectly. I use the clip to keep the cord behind me when I lift, which is incredibly helpful. Sound is not phenomenal, but it's also not bad. Use the EQ on whatever your using and these should sound fine.I did get shocked once by these headphones over the two month's that I've had them. Other than that, these are perfectly acceptable workout earphones."
4,Good product,"Looks a little plastic, it looks very simple. It solves the purpose. Does not slip and fall from ure ears easily during a work out or jogging."
3,Sports Headphones,"Not bad. It does hold up well with sweat and rain. Little cumbersome if wearing with glasses or sunglasses. Wish it folded up more compactly when not in use, and would like to see reinforcement on the ""jack head"" since that is always the first spot the wires ""pull out"". Overall, very sturdy for running, AND it doesn't cut out when wet with sweat and rain which is really the whole idea."
2,If you sweat.....then sweat these,"I have owned 4 pairs of these headphones and i can tell you what you are going to expect....the earpiece doesn't stay in the ear so you don't get the full volume of the mp3 player. if you are working out and sweat, one ear is guarenteed to short out. sweat drips in the ear sometimes it comes back to life after it drys and sometimes it doesn't. if i were you i would check out Sony MDR-A35G i am going to try these next."
2,Disappointed this time around...,I have purchased these headphones before and was very pleased. Unfortunately I can not say the same this time around. The left ear phone was blown when I tried them the first time for my run. Not happy at all...I need to return them.
2,"Great idea, but didn't last long",These head phones were great -- until one ear just stopped working altogether. I didn't have them but for about 3 months or so before the right ear phone just stopped working. Really disappointing because it's a great idea -- they don't come out at all while running. Maybe I just got a bad one. I'm hoping I can get this partially refunded so I can try out another pair.
2,"Looks good, thats about it.","I bought these to use in the office because my old ones broke, and I was excited to try them out. I was dissappointed.Sound Quality - MehSo I put them on, expecting a clear sound, but getting an airy, muted sound. i think it is only made for loud music and not worried about how it sounds. I like the flexibility to turn the volume down and still retain sound quality.appearence - niceI like how they look, but I won't go to the point of creating an outfit around them. I give it up to sony that they have nice looking accesories.Durablilty - ?Cant really comment on that because I only got it today, but reading other reviews make me less than hopeful. we'll see.Hope this was helpful."
4,Well worth the price and more!,"Great set of sports headphones. Sound is not the greatest, but it works fine for doing activities such as running and working out. It fits nicely and stays on. You can't really ask for more."
4,Sports headphones,Had a pair for about 2 years before wear and tear caused one side to not work. Used when running. Comfortable on ears.
1,Not Good,"These had pretty good reviews when I bought them, but the sound quality was not good at all. After a few hours of use they started actually giving me very mild shocks every 5 minutes or so! Steer clear of these!"
1,Unhappy with headphones,I've always thought that I had fairly large ears - apparently - I do not. These headphones DO NOT stay put!! I spend half of my run messing around with keeping them on my ears. The rest of the time - I'm messing with the clip that clips the excess wire to your clothing. The clip doesn't stay put either! I'd love to say that they sound great - but since they ear piece never stays in place - I can't tell if it sounds good!
4,Sounds good to me..,These work well. Not as comfortable as some that I have used but they also seem to be more durable. Sound is fine and they stay on your ear well. Pick up a set without worry.
2,"Decent sound, terrible as sports headphones","The sound is decent. But the phones are terrible for sports, especially for running. They won't stay in. They are constantly falling off, pulling away so that you only hear through one ear, and the clip only worsens the problem. So I'm still on the hunt for headphones that won't fall off during a workout. These aren't them."
2,Defective Product,"When I first saw this, I thought how convenient it would be to have a clip on while I ran on the treadmill. After it came, I was appalled by the sound quality. Not only did I have to crank up the volume on my player, but the left ear was considerably lower. I had to take one of them out of my ear after it started to hurt my head with the imbalanced noise. It was probably a defective product, but I had to buy another, different type of sports earbuds immediately."
4,Solid Choice,"These headphones are good. I really hate the ear bob type phones, they always fall out of my ears. These fit snuggley over the ears and are good for doing physical activities such as working out. Very nice value for the price."
5,Great little headphones,"These things are great; they deliver decent sound quality, are compact, fit perfectly in the ear without making them sore and stay on without a problem during physical activity (skateboarding). Great product and cheap too."
2,Blackout problems,I've had the set about three weeks and have already replaced the main circuit board. The problem is that the screen and sound disappear for about 5 seconds several times an hour. The new board has slowed the problem but not eliminated it; it now blacks out about once an hour.I've replaced my cables and my satellite box but nothing changed.When it works the picture is amazing considering the price and the fact that this is EDTV. The sound through the provided speakers is adaquate.
5,pruning saw,It seems to be very good quality and I like the fact that the blade is replaceable. Good Christmas gift!
4,"classic pruning saw, also good for camping","My husband's favorite saw when we go camping.We had one for about 10 years, needed a new blade. Decided on a new saw.Now I can take the old one on a hiking trail for trail maintenance."
3,"Good, but not great","I purchased this saw and a Fiskars 93626935 PowerTooth Folding Saw at the same time. While this is a larger saw, I still end up using the Fiskars more often. They are more portable (and safer because the blade folds away) and do as good of a job on anything less than 2-3."" For anything larger than 3"" a bow saw (poperly tensioned) can beat the nonsense out of a clipper in handcutting. But I will saw that a bowsaw is akward up IN a tree, and that therefore there is a nice place for clippers in tight pruning spots. Still given a choice, the Fiskars beat this any day."
3,Saw cuts fast - warranty worthless,"I have purchased two of these saws because they cut limbs quickly and easily. However when the first saw's handle broke prematurely at the point where the bolts attach, I could not even get Corona's customer service to respond. I even sent them photos of the saw with the broken handle showing that the blade had little use and the plastic handle was defective. After three tries to get a replacement, I gave up. Good saw, bad company."
4,The Title Says It All,"This cd is one of my all time favorites. A collection of Chris's best, as the title states, rodeo rock and roll. I can't keep still when I listen to this collection. This is a definate ""get fired-up"" album. I have freinds that don't listen to much country but have gone out and picked it up after hearing it. If your like me and enjoy both country and rock, then get this cd. Like Chris LeDoux says, ""even cowboys like a little bit of rock and roll"""
1,An old version of another book,I was very annoyed to receive this book only to find out that it is an older version of Great Book of Wooden Toys (ISBN 978-1-56523-431-4) which I already have. Now I have a $4.00 dust collector that's only worth 50 cents in a yard sale.
5,Great Book,"The author has a very nice approach to toy making, putting every step in the perspective of the main objective of a toy: making children happy. It has a nice hands-on approach and even when it lacks some detail, the projects look very nice when finished. Making some of the toys as been very challenging because of the limited tools I own, still you can get around most parts with a scroll saw, a hand drill and a belt sander."
3,No muy bueno pero no tan malo.,"este cd no es muy bueno pero tampoco muy malo, pero se puede bailar de el."
5,Strong Biblically based role model for wives,"I was surprised by how attractive biblical marriage is portrayed within the pages of this encouraging little book. This is not about how to have a happy marriage/family life when both partners are 'wonderful'. This is the life-story of a woman who applied God's truths to her life and trusted in the Lord for the outcome. Her husband didn't suddenly turn into the romantic white knight she may have dreamed about in her youth, but she loved and respected him, even regarding his differences. She walked the walk, sacrificing many things to the Lord, and found that the secret to a happy life was a thankful heart. There just aren't very many Christian books out there that unabashedly take God's word as it is written. So many water it down with situational ethics...this one does not, but what an encouraging and riveting biography for us to follow."
4,Tommy Castro - Live!,"This DVD is a must if you are in to Tommy Castro and his band. The song selection could of been better but overall this DVD is pretty cool. Note, Some of the songs on the CD are not on this DVD."
1,"The ""I Don't Care"" Book","They meet. I don't care.They fall in love. I don't care.People die. I don't care.""Drama"" goes down. I don't care.The best character was the cop called Grindley, but even he wasn't all that good. The police incompetence was funny, but not funny enough.Also, ""La"" is a stupid nickname, and I hated having to read it repeatedly."
5,TNHE DOG BOOK TO OWN,"This doggie bible has it all. Wonderful information about each and every dog breed. Great photos, great health information, truly the doggie bible."
5,Dog Bible is great!!!,"This is a very thorough account of every - and I mean every - aspect of owning, being owned by, caring for & loving a dog. Furthermore, there are lots of excellent fotos; I highly recommend this book and have done so to my friends!"
5,Dog Bible,The book has a lot of good information. It has proved in a short time to be a valuable resource with us since we are raising and training dogs. It is easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who has dogs and wants to be a good dog-parent.
5,A Must Have,"This book is a excellent souce of information about our canine friends. If you love dogs, and need information regarding their health, and their care, then this a book for you. It has a wealth of ""how to's"" about everything for our pets.I recommend this book highly!!"
3,A Little Bit of Everything,"This book has a little bit of great information on a lot of topics. It was a slightly less wonderful than I thought it would be, but still overall a good book to have on hand."
5,MUST HAVE BOOK FOR ALL DOG OWNERS,This book was a gift for a friend and she feels that it is an excellent book! MUST HAVE BOOK for ALL DOG OWNERS! ATY
5,awesome!,"Hands down the most informative book about ""everything dog"" on !the market, and for the price why not? I can honestly say im learning again when i thought i had all the answeres."
1,This album is absolute crap.,"Do NOT! I repeat...DO NOT purchase this album, it stinks from end to end. Filled with amateur ripoff style songs that seem to go nowhere. I have known the leader of the band for about 5 years, and he is the biggest sociopath I have ever met. The only reason I gave this 1 star is because the options won't go any lower. In one word...pitiful."
4,another great tillerman book,"I read the book after having read Homecoming and Dicey's Song, and I loved it, too. It's great to see how Grandmother was when she was younger, and how Liza was, and most of all, Bullet Tillerman is a very good main character. He's not that likeable, however, but with a family like that you can't really blame him. He's like a more extreme version of Dicey, not wanting to have any friends, not caring about school or politics, just wanting to be left alone. Again, that's a great book. Homecoming is slightly better but not much, and you should read both."
5,beautiful,"This book breaks my heart every time I read it. Voigt has written some beautiful books, and this is one of her best."
3,Runner,"He was a runner.He was running because he liked to run.He has a brother and sister who ran away from home and from their father who tried to ""box them in"" .His brother left an old boat,and his sister left an old dog.This family was going threw a lot of stuff,they were fighting every day.The Runner hated his father and he didn't understand his father ""boxing in""everybody.I kind of like this book,but I think this book is very sad,but I think everybody needs to read this to understand more of life."
4,review on the runner,"I think this book did a great job showing the way a person reacts to things in there life. Bullet shows us how boxing a person in will only cause them to drift farther away. It did a good job of showing how Bullet wasen't sure how he was going to get out of his house, but he knew he would. He used running as away to escape many of the things that bothered him. Bullet soon would see war as his way out of the controling house his father ran. He watched his brother and sister leave, he saw no reason to why he couldn't do the same. Bullet was a strong and independent boy, and he died trying to gain more. From his father and i think from life in general. i don't think he liked many things in his life. the war seemed like away to escape that life and start a new."
3,The Runner,"The runner was a great book. I could relate to some of the problems bullet was going through. The book covered some issues that young people still face today. The book fits great in its time frame. However, I did not like the ending. It ended all to quick and not enough detail about the family and what all happened. I would not read this book if I didn't have to."
5,If you liked Catcher in The Rye...,"Alright, the stories are wildly dissimilar, but Cynthia Voigt's style of writing in this book reminded me strongly of Salingers in Catcher. At the same time, it is inarguably her OWN style, and she works it beautifully. I don't know what else to say, other than reconmending her other books - all of them, especially Homecoming - and asking why is she not recognised as one of America's greatest writers. These things truly seems half dumb-luck quite often. Perhaps the critics need to explore young adult literature a bit more? I suppose with the His Dark Materials trilogy being nominated for the Booker, people might start to take some notice of this genre. I certainly hope so."
3,not one of her best,"I enjoyed other books in the Tillerman cycle, but this book was not one of Voigt's best. The main character Bullet, a high school track star and an obstinate loner, is a racist. This is all right, as the book is set in the sixties. However, the protagonist does not noticeably change by the end of the book. He has had a new wrinkle put in his ideas about race, but he is pretty much the same personality that began the book. Whether this bothers you or not depends on your idea of an effective story and intriguing protagonist."
1,boy o boy is right,"I had to read this for school. I asked my teacher to read it cause i though it was really boring. She couldnt even make it through. the only fun part was one of my parteners during the group discussions making fun of tamer (hes not racist). The book is bad, I dont recommend it."
4,Great,"This is a wonderful book. Voigt skillfully balances themes of family tension, race relations, love and loss and death, separation and reconciliation in the story of Bullet's life. I highly recommend it, with or without the other Tillerman books."
3,The Runner,"The Runner was a good book. I read the whole book and barely ever felt bored. Yet I rate The Runner with three stars because it was hard for me to understand and of little interest to me issue wise... because I did not grow up in the sixties. I grew up in a very open-minded family many years after the sixties had past. It was hard for me to understand the racial tension that Bullet felt . I did not understand the woman's ""position"" was at home, that was hard for me to grasp. Yet in the same tone, it was a good book for me to read. Mainly because of the fact that I did not understand many of the issues families and people faced in the sixties. The book is literture, but it was part history lesson too. The book showed me how society is changing a little all the time for the better."
2,Matts THE RUNNER Review,"The Runner was about a kid named Bullet and he is a great runner, that is all he likes to do. Bullets dad is not a nice guy, he always boxes bullet in, by not letting him do what he wants. Bullets brother and sister were run out of the house, because their dad was that big of a jerk. Bullet was the best runner on the cross country team. Bullet being realy selfish and he ran only for himself. If the team needed help from bullet he would decline. After Bullet told the coach that he did not want to help he got kicked off the team. Lator on Bullet finally did the right thing and helped out the team and they ended up winning the championship. After all the excitment Bullet enlisted in the military and was killed for a sad ending."
2,the runner,I thought the runner was an alright novel. Cynthia Voigt is a good author but this book was hard for me to understand. Due to the fact that you have to be in bullets position. I personally can not put my self in his position so I was confused. But even though it confused me she did a good job writng it. It is a book for people that can put themselves in oter peoples position. If there is any body that can do that than I would highly suggest to read this book.
4,Another Tillerman Classic,"All of the Tillerman Books are amazing, and this takes an introspective look into Dicey's uncle, father, running, blacks and the Vietnamese war. All of these plot lines make a unique blend and enjoyable book."
1,"""The Runner"" Sucks","This is one of the worst books I ever read. Voigt obviously did zero research; you don't become a good runner by running ten miles every day forever, rare steak is the worst thing you can eat he night before a race, cross country is not a track event and the courses are clearly marked and do not vary in distance and NEVER have fences to jump over. All the characters are shallow and boring, and the ending is pointless. The only reason I even finished was because I wanted to see just how retarded it could get. The answer: completely retarded."
3,Average,"Maybe it's because I was forsed to read it for school, but I did not enjoy this book very much. I kind of found it confusing and irritating. The whole book's story is told from his mind, so you're like reading his thoughts about everything. That's fine if you agree with what he thinks about racial issues. I didn't, therefore his racist mind had me agrivated. It's a personal preference, but I did not like it that much. It's an OK read."
2,Yuck!,I did not like this book very much. I don't like the way Bullet deals with things and I don't like how he's so racist. I gave this book 2 stars in stead of 1 because I could get through this book even though it took me 2 weeks. I reccomend reading Homecoming or Dicey's Song instead.
3,Not As Good As The First One,Tatu's first CD was great. After getting this album I'm a little disappointed. I just think it could have been better. They did have a few good songs on it though. I loved Cosmos & Loves Me Not. But it doesn't have the same effect as the first CD had where I loved each song. This one too me just didn't have that spunk that Tatu had before.
2,Ugh...,"I have been a huge t.A.T.u fan since 2002... I have pretty much all of their songs including the russian remixes (like Galoyan, Fly Dream, etc.)... and I have to say... this entire CD is western wash. It sounds absolutely nothing like their old stuff... not to mention three of the videos that they made from this CD is BORING. I miss the old t.A.T.u... I say, they get Ivan back and start dancing around in their underwear again pretending to be lesbians."
3,Ok... their first album was much better!,"This album does not in any way, shape or form live up to the first. The lyrics are nice, but its just like any other pop album. The girls have lost most of their techno feel, which is something that I really loved about them. You can't really dance to any of these songs, which was another great thing about the first album. So 3 stars pretty much somes it up, good, but not great, only because their first album was so exceptional+"
3,"good, but not as good as the first",This album has its moments and is a really good album. I wish it could be better but it is still good.
2,Okay but def. not as good as their first release,I really loved their first release. Dangerous and Moving has a lot of the same catchy tunes as the first. I did listen to 30 seconds of each song (before I bought this one) and I guess I assumed the songs would be even better -full version.
4,"Actually, pretty darn good","I would have given t.A.T.u.'s last album 2.5 stars (most of which because of the amazing single ""All the things she Said"", but this album is a solid 4 stars. Reason being, it's much more listenable. In fact, the first 6 songs are all very good, and could each be radio singles (well, the 1st song is actually an instrumental intro).The sound is definitely different. Uses a lot of cosmic, techno sounds, piano, and deep bass beats, which actually blend together quite well. In fact, the music is actually very solid. Sure, the Russian duo's voices are nothing to write home about, but the songs speak for themselves.I couldn't take their debut album seriously, as I found it awfully corny/cheesy. However, this album is legit in every way, shape, and form. Two thumbs up, for sure. Get this album!"
4,A more mature album....,"Well...it was disappointing to find out that the who bi/lesbian deal was a marketing scheme. But I'll live, lol. This cd is definitly more mature sounding than the last one. Unfortuantly for me it had less of a techno/trance feel (ehich I liked in the last album). But the cd is awesome regardless. This one is much more calm overall. Julia's voice is much less screechy now! And their english pronunctiation has become better. I liked the songs All about us, Loves me not, and Dangerous and Moving. If you liked the first cd, then you'll lovethis one."
5,TATU,"This Cd is one of their best yet, however I wish they had done more songs in Russian. But the beat is nice, much more like Ace of Bace and other great bands of the early 90's it's a great album and their english has really improved. Great CD"
4,Dangerously Addictive,"Sure, the second album from t.a.T.u. hasn't strayed much from their first album, but that doesn't mean it's a bad venture. In fact, it's quite a catchy cd. Dancy, rocky, and just plain fun, this album has big enough to go bass fishing. All about Us is another rocking us vs. them anthem, and We Shout launches the girls into a lighter spacy bit that's sure to keep fans interested in repeat spins.in a rocking dance kind of way that is surely to please anybody who was satisfied with their first outing."
4,Dangerously close to an amazing album,With Dangerous and Moving TaTu have proven that they arent the usual pop band. The cd has great guitar moments and amazing beats. Their vocal performances are alot better this time around. They dont sound as whiny as they did on their first cd. Not that Im saying that their last cd was bad...i liked it...this is just much better and shows that they are actually getting more mature.
2,I would get the Russian version if I were you...,"Since they got so much MTV attention in the US and sold a billion copies of the translated version of their Russian language hit ""200 Po Vstrechnoj"", TATU decided to do their second album in english. Of course they also did a Russian version called ""Ljudi Invalidi"" which is the one I'm recommending. No, you don't have to know Russian to appreciate the songs."
4,"Overall, a good sophomore effort...","t.A.T.u. has had a very interesting experience here in the US. Their first song, ""All The Things She Said"" was HUGE. Then, the hype about their sexuality took over, dwarfing other potential hits ""Not Gonna Get Us"" and ""Show Me Love."" Their second CD definitely has some high points worth checking out -""All About Us,"" has an amazing arrangement (the uncensored version of the video is quite eye-opening, btw). ""Craving"" is a welcome departure for the girls. I could see myself racing down the highway to the title track. Hopefully, they get a chance here...time will tell."
4,Uneven: great and awful,"A tale of two albums.Great: ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"" was the Bee Gees' first US #1 hit; ""Israel"" is a terrific & passionate song; ""Somebody Stop the Music"", ""Trafalgar"" and ""Don't Wanna Live Inside Myself"" are layered and interesting in a way the Bee Gees hadn't been since ""Odessa""; and I have always loved the finale, the lush ""Walking Back to Waterloo"" (for many years my favorite Bee Gees song).Awful: ""Dearest"" has got to be the worst song they ever recorded, embarassingly and comically bad. It's hard not to laugh when you hear it. ""Remembering"" is hardly better. For some reason, the songs where Robin takes the lead vocals just don't work on this album: ""Lion In Winter"" and ""When Do I"" are also bad.For me, the great stuff on this album easily outweighs the bad, thus the high rating. But be prepared for some jarring potholes when motoring thru this album."
5,Breath taking!,Ok i'm very big fan of anime...and i'm quite the picky one...This story is about a famous actress that chase her love through the wall of time...they made a promess back when she was a little girl that they'll meet each other again...Holding the mysterious key which suppose the be the greatest of all treasure...Chiyoko grow up to be a famous actress so she can draw her love's one attention.... a wish that would never actually come true... but then again...hehehehehe i don't want to reveal all the twist to this story... but basically... this is by far the best anime i've seen since 'Grave of the fireflies'.Beautiful soundtrack as well...Trust me.... this one is more than worth it :)
4,Millennium Actress anime film,"I liked it, well made and all that, but it isn't one that I'd really watch again. The storyline is very well conceived of and executed. A drama mostly, and I wonder if that is why repeat viewings aren't considered? That does seem to apply usually, but this is a very good film."
5,Epic Anime Masterpiece,"This sweeping anime epic follows an aging actress as she tells the story of her life to two documentary filmmakers. This films storyline is not linear so any synopsis would not due it justice. Needless to say if you are a fan of Anime.. Not just the fanboy or mecha anime but gorgeous animation with mature themes and stories. You will be blown away by this film. Even if anime is not your cup of tea, the sophistaced story will awaken you to the fact that animation is not just for kids anymore. Easily one of the best films I have seen this past year."
3,Extremely refreshing,This movie is a fantastic adventure that is not the in the norm of other anime. Millennium actress is just an interesting story shown an interesting way. I would not be surprised if an American director steals this movie and make it a live action film.
3,GUYS AT DREAMWORKS NEED TO MEND THEIR WAYS!!!,"millennium actress is one gem of a movie, not just in animated category but in any category. it has a very strong plot and the most unusual storytelling i've ever seen.i wish someone other than dreamworks had the publishing right to this film. though the picture quality and other aspects of this disc is just fine yet a decent english track would have been highly appreciated specially by those who dont have the patience to go through the subtitles, missing out on all those great visuals.the people at dreamworks seem to be a little too busy just cashing in on these films without actually putting any effort from their own side.and they just dont seem to be learning anything from their mistakes either. another great film ghost in the shell: innocence, released last year on dvd by dreamworks, got the same (or shall i say even worse??) treatment by them.still recommended."
5,Great follow-up to Perfect Blue,"While Perfect Blue was Satoshi Kon's fantastic debut film, his follow-up film, Millennium Actress, do not fail you. Matter of fact, this movie is a perfect example of what Satoshi Kon is capable of. Perfect Blue was a psychological mind-thriller. This movie on the other hand is a drama, of going back to time to see the aged actress' career from start to finish. I will not give out any spoilers but this is definitely a movie to check out if you loved Perfect Blue."
3,should have an English sound track,"By reading and watching I think I got what was going on, but I suspect alot of the movie is lost on those of us who don't understand japanese. Its a complex plot with several twist and we are given the very condensed version of it. If dreamworks wants to bring Anime to the mainstream they should get a clue from Disney."
2,Could have been better,"Miyoko Shji tried to be far too clever for his own good. I liked the flashbacks of the actresses life throughout different periods of Japanese history and would have been fully satisfied with watching how her life played out. Shji detracted from the film by inserting the interviewer and the cameraman within the flashbacks which, after awhile, became annoying. And elements that intertwined the actress's real life with her stage life was more confusing than imaginative. I suppose with an 87 minute long movie, Shji had to find some way to fill up time.The visuals were great. Everything else detracted from it."
4,Satoshi Kon's Movin on Up!,"If Perfect Blue had better animaton, it would look like this. Millennium Actress is a beautifully crafted film. Told in a very original perspective, in the eyes of a former actress but followed by two film makers.My only beef with this DVD is, well the DVD. The features listed on the back of the cover mention a commentary by director/writer Satoshi Kon. There is no commentary on this disc like there was on the Region 2 release. There is however a nice documentary on the film in the extras along with the U.S. trailer. The main problem with the disc comes in on the language set up. Picking either a subtitle or a audio takes you right back to the top menu which is a pain because you have to go back again if you want something else. It's just not a good menu.But anyway, if you are prejudice against Japanese Animation, slap yourself and see this film. Anyone who has the least bit of interest in film will love this."
5,Best. Movie. Ever.,"Words can not describe the depth and scope of this film. It was a little hard to follow at first - or so I thought - but the more I watched it, the more I got sucked in. It was no longer about understanding or following the story, it was about immersing myself in the most incredible narrative I've ever experienced. Perhaps I love this movie more than other people, but maybe, just maybe you will find yourself forever touched as I was. I'm not ashamed to admit that I started to freak [cry] out as the movie concluded. This is a story about life - from the beginning to the end. The people we love, and the people who love us are all a part of who we are. They touch our lives until the very moment it ends, and perhaps beyond..."
5,Excellent choice,"It is not a surprise that such an outstanding author as Fernando developed this excellent material as a performer. All the songs are terrific, but my favorites are ""Por nuestro amor"" and ""falta"", which contain the perfect balance between arrangements, mixes and lyrics that go deep into anyone's soul. I truly recommend it."
1,Handle Failure After One Year of Light Use,"It looks so elegantly designed, and worked great when it was first used. However, after making several 3/4"" cuts I first noticed that the handles were bent inward. So I straightened them and continued using them on smaller tasks. But alas the handles were still rebending, even on 1/2"" branches and stems. Then after restraightening it for about the 3rd or 4th time, one of the handles snapped about 3/4"" from the center (axle) of rotation; right where the cross-sectional area of steel is smallest.Perhaps the steel was never heat treated, or was heat treated incorrectly. The quality of the steel could have also been of inferior composition. Regardless, I will not purchase another of these."
1,Not as advertised,"The item we ordered was advertised as a Corona clipper, but it turned out to be a chinese imitation. If this was to be a clone then it should have been better stated and should not have been called a Corona clipper. The item we received looked somewhat like the real thing but slightly smaller with green vinyl handle covers."
1,"False Advertising, Recieved a cheap imitation","I'd like to be writing about the great new Corona clippers that I bought from Jacks Tool Shed but Jack sent me a cheap 'Made In China' imitation instead. He says they look just like the real thing, too bad they're just a worthless piece of junk!!!!!!"
2,"Not ""Made in USA""","I bought this because another reviewer had stated it was made in USA.Well apparently, not anymore. It is now made in Mexico with parts from various contries.Not impressed with the new BP 3180 or with Corona shipping jobs overseas."
4,contains in-depth study of human psychology,I liked this book because of it's sequential and systematical analysis of human behaviour.
4,Clipper,"This clipper is a big scissors, that's all. There's no rotation of the blades relative to the handle, as the ad on Amazon says. My pair is OK, but the spring is a real workout machine, and I'm wondering how to lighten it a bit. I find that the shears gum up with grass juice very quickly, and then the blades bind (won't open with the spring). I carry a wrung-out rag while I'm trimming and wipe the blades quite often to keep them free of drying grass juice. This works, and I'm able to keep on snipping for as long as I want. The shears are sharpenable, and the construction seems strong. I really would like to ease that spring -- that stiff spring is really my only beef with these."
4,Great entry point for Old-School Comedy,"This isn't your parents's Sanford & Son Redd Foxx! This disc presents a ton of really good routines and one-liners from the man who started ""blue"" comedy. Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce both come out of this man, and it shows fairly well on this disc. It's not as nasty or blue as some of his other records, but it does show Foxx at the top of his form telling stories (""Letter To A Wife"" is incredible, even by today's standards) and joke after joke after joke. The man is an encyclopedia of dirty jokes, and balances his whole act with a strong grip on class, which, considering some of the content, is genius unto itself.You can find dirtier Foxx, but this collection is a great break-in point for any other purchases you might consider. If you like this one, you'll dig the other stuff. If you don't, lean off it all. This is a great collection of material and scope of Foxx's work."
3,"Eh, its okay","I thought it would be more situational stand up similar to Pryor or Cosby. It was full of standard jokes and one liners. Not my cup of tea, but okay if you just want to hear Redd Foxx again."
2,Barbie's biggest flop!,"This doll is beautiful and excites kids when they first see it. But after a minute or two of playing with it, the choker breaks, the hair is too tangled and messed up (and unable to return to normal without it falling out when you brush it), and just doesn't hold my daughter's interest. She played with this a few times, then left it buried in the bottom of her Barbie box cause ""it just wasn't very pretty anymore."" I got my other daughter the Barbie ballerina doll, and that doll was more flexible, fun, and durable for both my girls to play with, and the hair stayed in when they brushed it. I'm going to have to get another one of the ballerina Barbie's for my other daughter, otherwise continue listening to them fight over it. :0)"
1,don't waste the money,My daughter is 5 and she loves barbie and wanted these dolls She got the princess and prince and horse and carriage for Christmas The Princess left foot fell off Christmas Day and The Carriage would not stay connected to the horse When we went to change the dolls clothes the necklace broke It is now April and almost nothing is left that can be played with The prince did stay together but she doesn't like playing with it without the barbie There are plenty of other barbie that are much better
2,I was not impressed,"Barbie dances around, my daughter likes it but I think the stand is fairly flimsy and will probably break. Ken the nutcracker can dance too, but it is hard to get both dolls snapped on at the same time."
4,Broken stand and broken leg,"My 5-year-old daughter received the Sugar Plum Princess Barbie for Christmas last year and within a few hours the plastic stand contraption had snapped. She was devastated, since she'd wanted this doll for months. We returned it to Target the following day and received a new doll, which my daughter loved and played with continually until less than 2 weeks later I saw her feverishly taping and retaping something on the floor. When I went over to see what she was doing, I realized she was trying to reattach Barbie's lower ""flexible"" foot, which had snapped off. By this point, I was fed up with the doll and the shoddy way in which it was made, and although for some reason known only to my daughter, she's saved the foot in her jewelry box, she has also stopped playing with the doll since, as she puts it, ""Ballerinas don't just hop, Mommy."""
3,"Looked nice, but...","My daughter loved this doll when she got her. Not long after, the stand that holds the Barbie up broke. The crown also broke off after a few months. My daughter stills plays with the doll and doesn't really care about the broken pieces; however, I am a little disappointed with it.If you want this Barbie for a collection or display that's fine. But if you are looking for a fun toy for your kids, I'd say find a different Barbie, unless (like my daughter) your kids don't mind playing with something that's broken."
5,My Granddaughter LOVED it.,My Grandaughter absolutely loved her Sugar Plum Barbie. She has a special place for it in her bookcase. I think it may be the first of her doll collection. It really made a hit with her.
5,Another great Pantera CD..,"This is one of the best Pantera CD's out there...they made the record only 10 tracks probably so that they could concentrate on making more good songs rather than a greater quantity. It's really heavy and has some great incredible riffs by Dimebag, probably the best metal guitarist that hasn't crossed over into the korn/bizkit style music and has kept his incredible and original solos going. Buy this album...seems like they created this with the energy that they created Cowboys from hell with.."
4,"Awesome, but not the best","Even though i bought this album back when came out how ever many years ago, i'm just now writing a review for it. My main problem with this album is it doesn't carry my attention like past Pantera albums like Driven or Trendkill. Don't get me wrong, it was definately worth the wait, but i was a little dissapointed. Songs like ""Yesterday Don't Mean Sh*t"" and ""Revolution Is My Name"" are some of my favorite songs that Pantera has put out. But the song ""Death Rattle"" doesn't even seem like a Pantera song. Its too bad that Pantera is cashed. They seem like the only heavy band in the mainstream with any integrity left."
4,Its got a little bit of Everything,"After The Great Southern Trendkill (Which was somewhat disappointing for me), Pantera went back into the studio (after what seemed like forever for fans) and created an album that uses elements from all of their previous albums. Suffice to say, it was worth the wait. They have used all their different sounds to create a new one that suits them right. I'm an old School CFH, and it took me awhile for this album to grow on me, but I'm sure old and new fans alike will grow to rock to this album."
2,What happened?,"Now, as you may or may not have noticed, this isn't new stuff at all. I'm talking about PanterA selling out back in the time of Far Beyond Driven. That's when the guitars started to sound too scratchy along with Philips vocals (He'd be screaming when Dimebag fidles with the guitar). But this is a whole new level. Belive it or not, this gets to sound a little bit like Nirvana! (which you see on ""Revolution is My Name""), and we don't want that, now do we? Take it from me, this along with Far Beyond Driven and The Great Southern Trendkill , is NO must get at all!"
2,Reinventing lacks something...,"Reinventing The Steel thier fifth albumReinventing The Steel overall is just boring. Revolution Is My Name, Uplift and It Makes Them Dissapear are the only reason I gave this album 2 stars. The rest of the songs on here are just crap. I still reccomend this album to Pantera fans because you will find at least a couple songs you like; but to everyone else, leave this heap behind."
3,the downfall,"this was a poor attempt at ""throwing"" a record out,and just plain ""winging it"".still good cause it's pantera,but the smart lyrics and innovative musicianship are sub-par.this was the ""album for the fans""(or kiddie-headbang-tunes as I call them).I think that after phil was sober enough to really hear what pantera had put out on the market with this cd,it's the true reason why he exited the band(just take a listen to dime + vinnie play on damageplan's cd-not exactly what phil was willing to degrade himself to!).the ""oomph!"" is nonexistent.but,like I said,it's still decent metal but just isn't a monsterous opus.get ""far beyond driven"",""cowboys from hell"",""101 proof"";or slayer's""seasons in the abyss"",buckethead's""cuckoo clocks of doom"",cannibal corpses'""the bleeding"",morbid angel's""formulas fatal to the flesh"",fear factory's""demanufacture"",sepulytura's""roots"",""beneath the remains"",or ""arise""etc,etc,etc.read enough of the reviews and you can get to the really good stuff!"
5,Pantera - Reinventing the Steel,"WOW! Pantera have added so many innovative ideas to this genre. The new album is a killer, gets better with every listen and is consequently very addictive. The balance this time around (betwixt guitar and drum pyrotechnix) is spot on."
5,Pantera- Great as Ever!,Pantera are as heavy as ever and I don't see them stoping anytime soon! All the people who said this album falls short they are wrong! Just listen to the samples provided and make your decision I think you will agree with me they are a heck of a metal band and just keep getting better!
4,Still Kickin,"Pantera puts out another solid album with RTS. Comparable to VDP and earlier material, the album doesn't test the waters as much as Trendkill, but it doesn't matter. Straight through, this s**t rocks, and there's nothing more to say about it. There's not one bad song on the whole album, which you'll learn by the second time through. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the occasional lack of drive in some songs. Additionally, Kerry King's solo on GD Electric is almost unidentifiable (we all know he can do much better!)Overall, the benefits greatly outweigh the weaknesses, and RTS is a must in any collection that rocks."
2,come on....,"This album really doesn't do much. Overall, it doesn't have the anger of TGSTK or FBD and the riffs just arent as good as those found on Vulgar. The band is getting a bit long in the tooth, as it becomes evident that Pantera is actually just the AC/DC of the 90s. There IS no real aggression here. If you happen to be one of the ""circus freak pantera fan"" variety, this might be right up your alley. It's pretty boring, pretty short, and pretty dissapointing. This band has softened up and gone the way of Hetfield and crew. 'Tis a darn shame, I reckon."
2,Pantera not so Pantera any more,"I bought Panteras new album 2 days ago, hoping right when i put it in the cd player in my car, i would be blown away by Crunching guitars, loud vocals, and the amazing over all sound that Pantera can provide like no other metal band today. I heard the crunching guitars, as well as the loud vocals, but the overall sound was terrible. This CD has the potential to be one of Panteras greatest records, but in my opinion it is lacking one thing,*UNITY*. Dont get me wrong, i love metal, and i love Pantera. But if any metal record, or any type of music for that matter, lacks unity, then you have nothing. Mabye Pantera should have waited another year or so to work on this. Better luck next time guys."
2,REINVENTING TH STEEL,"I thik that the new Pantera album is a dissapointment. I think it is too thrashy and lacks the melody and the guitar riffs and solos of their previous albums. The only ""amazing"" song on the album is ""revolution is my name""I think that pantera should make more albums like vulgar display of power and cowboys from hell. They are great ""5 star"" albums. this is not.This new album needed some melodic songs such as ""this love"" and ""hollow"" and ""cemetery gates""It also lacked power guitar eg: walk, a new level. It definitly lacked solos: walk, floods, cemetery gates, 10s, this love.anyway, although it was a big dissapointment i still love PANTERA and i would love to see them down here in Australia."
2,What?,"Ok, what is up with Pantera? I am a big fan, but this cd just doesn't kick. The only catchy tune is Uplift. Do yourself a favor, go listen to Cowboys From Hell or TGSTK, those are the best two. I think I'd rather hear N'Sync (as horrible as they sound). But seriously people, the only reason this gets 2 stars is because of (1. the song Uplift-- and (2. I've heard much worse."
5,Anyone who gives them less then a 4 stars is crazy....,"You guys are completly insane. First off. Every Pantera album is a 5 starer, ok ""tredkill"" was a four. Pantera rocks like non other. I own every album. This isnt even their best one and its still a 5 starer. If you like this album buy the rest. I swear you wont be disapointed! Dimebag is one of the best axe players EVER! And Phil Anselmo is a great singer! Lets not forget some one who is always over looked...Vinnie Paul. He has to be the best drummer around. His pounding the drums is INTENESE! PLEASE! Support Pantera and buy this album. I usally hate spending money on CD's but not for these guys."
4,Pantera = Metal,"After a 4 yr. hiatus, these crazy Texas boys returned in 2000 with an album that is so straight ahead metal, it immediately stands out among today's rap-metal breatheren. No DJ's here, just hardcore metal like the blistering opener ""Hellbound"" and the eerie ""I'll Cast A Shadow."" ""Revolution Is My Name,"" with Dimebag riffs-aplenty is one of the best songs the band has ever done, while on ""Goddamn Electric"" Phil Anselmo drops in Sabbath and Slayer references. A couple of the songs are throwaways, which keeps it from being 5 stars, but all in all, this amped up version of ""Trendkill"" was well worth the wait."
1,Waste of sound,"This has none of the feeling power or talent of the past albums. All the other Pantera albums are fantastic, they should have let this garbage sit in the recycle bin."
2,The End of The Line,"Pantera, for many, signified the integrity of the heavy metal movement in America, long after it had been declared dead. After bands like Metallica and Megadeth abandoned the genre, Pantera stood firm, and delivered, both in the studio and live. Their final effort, as it turns out, would not be the best chapter in the Pantera story.This album resembles a band attempting to sound like Pantera. Few tracks are able to carry themselves, and it makes for an overall weak album. The dynamics and variety of previous albums is absent here, again pointing to the idea that Pantera was trying to be Pantera. The music does not sound natural, but it does sound forced."
3,Rehashing the Steel,"You can actually hear Pantera dying . . .That's too bad because Pantera was probably the last of the legitimate Speed Metal bands. RtS isn't terrible but it's obvious that the band had lost their creative edge by that point. It's o.k. fodder for the hardcore fan but nothing special otherwise. Should have been called ""Rehashing the Steel.""Not recommended."
2,ITS NO COWBOYS FROM HELL,"Let me just say one thing, I think that Pantera got too mixed up in the whole selling out thing. They thought more about not selling out then making music and it shows on the album. This is all about we are still a metal band and not about man that song is awsome. The difference between MetallicA and PanterA is that MetallicA is and was just better musically, they never cared about this or that they just play what they feel, which is exactly how it should be. This is an decent album at best, but I'm waiting for November when MetallicA's new album is supposed to be released, James was quoted as saying that ""Its really really heavy."" Can't wait for another ""Master of Puppets"". Thats my MetallicA."
2,Proof that Pantera is Through,"This album is good. BUT for a Pantera album it is horrible. From the best thrash metal band EVER, this is crap! Phil does not sing at all on the CD. He is one of the few that can scream and sing both very well, but on this album he kinda sells out. Not bad, but not good. DOWN's second album is way better than this one!!!"
1,UP IN FLAMES!!!,"My title refers to the track record of awesome albums starting with ""Cowboys from Hell"" and ending with ""The Great Southern Trendkill."" Should have stopped there, boys. I really wish you would have. The picture of a guy jumping through a fire with a bottle of booze COMPLETELY illustrates the lack of vision, creativity and compositional talent that went into this album. Sure Dimebag was one of the the best guitarists ever (and it's a shame that dimebag got smoked [LOL, anyone?]), but that fact alone doesn't make a good album. Their credibility as an unstoppable, solid-gold-album-churning machine has gone ""up in flames"" with this one. ""Revolution is my Name"" is a good song, but all of their previous albums had numerous GREAT songs - not just one good one."
2,can you say CHEESE?,"Alright, yet another groundbreaking adrenaline macho album from Pantera.Metal has to be the cheesiest and LEAST HEAVY form of music on earth. REINVENTING THE STEEL? Give me a break, Pantera has to be the Judas Priest of the 90s (or 2000s). Cheesy!The lyrics are the usual ""OOOH FEEL THE GLOVES OF METAL"" and Phil is still doing his best Henry Rollins impression.The music stinks, just when you think its about to sound hardcore (heaviest form of music on earth) Dimebag Darrel (formerly named Diamond Darrel)or whoever the guitar player is throws in a cheese ball hi twiddling metal chord and ruins everything making it sound like a metal song.Though this joke band is pretty much cornball they put on great live shows living up to and surpassing the music on the album, too bad its metal. I wish this corny form of music would die!Check out A.C. (phil sings on a A.C.'s 40 More Reasons to Hate Us), Impaled, Nasum, Black Flag, or even WeeN if you want something new."
1,THIS CD MADE MY HEAD SPIN---LITERALLY,"1 OF THE WORST CDS OF THE YEAR. LOTTA GROWLING + LOTTA SHOUTING = 1 BIG HEADACHE! I'M AT THE RECORD STORE A FEW DAYS AGO AND ""REINVENTING THE STEEL"" WAS BLARING PULSATINGLY LOUD AT THE DJ BOOTH. HOW COULD PEOPLE WORK UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS? THE CUSTOMERS SUFFER. I BOLTED OUT OF THE STORE FEELING MISERABLE. AN AWFUL AWFUL CD FROM PANTERA! I SHOULD'VE SMASHED THE STEREO SYSTEM W/ MY BARE HANDS. GO AHEAD, PRESS ""NO"" IF THIS REVIEW WASN'T HELPFUL!"
5,"Pantera, yet again, shows the metal scene what's up","I don't understand why people think this is their worst release. It's Pantera, they are ""100% against the grain American metal."" This album is really underated, give it a listen or two and you'll be into RTS. It starts off with Hellbound, an incredible opener and one hell of a song, and the intensity just keeps on going and doesn't let up. This whole album is full of bad...songs and awesome riffs, the things that Pantera are well known for. Dimebag just took his whole guitar playing up a notch on this release, the same goes for Rex and Vinnie. Phil's vocals are in top form as well. I can't really put the greatness of this album into words, so just do yourself a favor and buy it."
4,Reinventing The Steel,"This is an excellent Pantera album. I would still take the bands earlier stuff over this like Cowboys From Hell and Vulgar Display of Power. The good thing is though that Pantera is keeping true heavy metal alive. This album is very heavy and will shatter your ear drums when played at loud volume. This album is great from the start to the finish and is nothing but non stop heavy metal. My favorite tracks are ""Goddamn Electric"", ""We'll Grind That Axe For A Long Time"", and ""I'll Cast A Shadow"". I think any fan of heavy metal will enjoy this album. If you are just starting off with Pantera definetly get this album but just not as of yet and work on getting the bands earlier stuff. You will appreciate the early stuff especially Cowboys From Hell which is one of the greatest Thrash albums of all time, alot more and then this album will just take you into the true depths of heavy metal. Long live Pantera."
2,They can seriously do so much better,"No wonder I hated Pantera the first time I heard them. ""Reinventing The Steel"" was the first full listen of Pantera I ever had. Compare this album with previous efforts and it's a flat-out joke. Sure, it's heavy, sure it's got attitude, but it has no substance at all. What happened to the band that brought us such brutal anthems as ""5 Minutes Alone"" and ""Walk"" or the melodic ""Cemetary Gates"" and the cover of Black Sabbath's ""Planet Caravan?"" Reinventing the Steel, to me, represents Pantera as going through the motions. Everything is just a rehash. Most of the songs sound the same. I think even the band know that this CD is pretty lousy, after all, when you take the CD out of the case, there's a picture behind the CD of the band laughing at you and drinking beer."
2,What happened?,"I know that no one will agree with me. I am a huge panterea fan and i have gone through hell to see them live. I have all the albums including a few that some people have never heard of. And this new one is the biggest piece of crap I have ever heard! I love Pantera, but, you can't tell me this cd is good. Songs one and two are great. And the last song is great. The other 7 songs sound like 1 big song. I really hope things turn around soon. What Phil and the rest of the guys were thinking is beyond me. And just to make it clear, Cowboys on through to Trendkill, were some of the best albums ever written. Everyone gets at least one bad album. So with any luck this was their only one."
5,well it IS pantera...and i HAVE missed em for 4 years,"what can u write about a pantera album....blazing guitars screaming vocals thrashfest of drums and what have u got....freakin bloody screamin mess of the head as the reviewer correctly wrote about Far Beyond Driven. Now since i consider pantera along with Tool to be the 2 bands that r gonna pave the way for heavy music into the next millenium, i am gonna be shamelessly biased and give the album 5 stars anyways....as for the album its pretty neat...starts with a bang....ends with a wondrously melodic song and rox like no one's business in the middle. I think u have to listen to it more than once in order to get into it. Also i think Pantera shud have had a greater amount of music in that cd, more than just 45 minutes, as the fan rightly said goddamit we been waiting for 4 years ...we want more"
3,Eh...more of the same.,"Pantera don't really reinvent anything on this album, just another album full of southern-styled basic metal. Nothing special, really. I'd recommend getting Far Beyond Driven or TGSTK over this album."
4,Wow!,"I am impressed! And since I just got this cd, this will be really short until I absorb what I just heard!This takes me back to the days of vulgar display and far beyond, only this is so much HEAVIER. It is also alot more musical. Heavy guitars and pounding drums makes you want to get up thrash! And Phil's viscious vocals really get you going. Get this and hear it for yourself!"
4,Its got a little of everything,"After The Great Southern Trendkill (which was slightly dissapointing), I thought Pantera would head in the wrong direction towards the dozens of no-name, screaming-voice-with-fast-guitar groups. Instead, they borrowed a little bit of all their other albums and made a new sound that suits them right. What keeps this from a 5 star is the lack of memorable tunes, like 5 minutes alone and domination from their older albums. I've been a fan since Vulgar in '92, so I'm into old school Pantera, but I think old school and new school fans alike will appreciate the new sound. A must-buy for any true Cowboy From Hell."
4,RTS,"I read the negative reviews on this CD, so I decided to go back and listen to it. It doesn't bother me that there aren't catchy hooks on this work. That's not what Pantera was about anyway. Listen to it closely. There's some outstanding guitar and bass playing on this album. It also shows some great rhythm playing by Dime. It's not really like the 1st 3 albums, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I like when a band evolves the right way. I'd also like to strongly agree with another reviewer here who said something to the effect of, yeah, Dime's gone, but put on one of Pantera's CD's and it brings him back to life. This album is definitly for hardcore Pantera fans. You may not like it if you're one of those stuck on the first 3 albums and cannot get past them. You may want to re-examine your loyalties."
4,Sold out? WTF?!?!?,"Whoever says that Pantera sold out w/ this album obviously doesn't listen to Pantera on a regular basis as I do. The main objective of Pantera's music is to enfuriate it's listeners. If the music makes you want to jump in the pit and beat the crap out of someone..then it has served it's purpose. Now, while this album doesn't do for me what Trendkill does, it still makes my blood run hot. For me, the best part is the pinch harmonics riff near the end of Revolution is My Name. When I hear that, I feel like smashing everyones face around me. But I don't, because if I did that, then they would blame Pantera for all violence in the world[...]."
5,Their best since Vulgar Display of Power!,Reinventing the Steel is the best Hardcore metal Cd I've heard in along time. Pantera has made one of the best albums of the year with this one. It's got the heaviness of Vulgar Display of Power and that unmistakable Pantera groove from Far Beyond Driven. We Pantera fans have been waiting a long time for this and it's even heavier and even more hardcore than the last studio record!
2,"Oh well, even Pantera isn't perfect","I absolutely love the previous 4 Pantera albums, each in their own way. This album isn't in the same league, it sounds like a copy band that's flawlessly reproducing the notes and the sounds, but doesn't come anywhere close on the music. Pantera still rocks, they always did, but there's not a single hint of the content that made previous albums so emotionally shattering. No memorable riffs or quotable lyrics. I never thought I'd have wasted money on a Pantera album, but I guess this shows even they make mistakes."
2,Pantera Goes Stale,"This album starts out great. Then it switches to track two. After that, this disc has nooo bite. Who is this playing anyway? I was so disappointed when this came out. Even more so becase I jam with a guy that is pretty tight with them, and he assured me that it was the best yet. Afraid not. Here is my advice. I know that I generally go for the more extreme (i.e. Nile, Suffocation). So I advise you to find a friend that already has this one and give it an extended listen before you plunk down hard-earned cash for this. You might save yourself a few bucks."
1,What happened to Panthera??,"Ever since ""Vulgar Display of Power"" they have been more and more dissaponting. At least ""Far Beyond Driven"" and ""Trendkill"" had several good songs on each of them...""Reinventing the Steel"" has Hellbound and that is it. I tried listening to the entire album over and over again - it just doesn't work. Try their previous four efforts - MUCH better."
5,MY FAVORITE CD EVER,I own four Pantera cd's and this one is by far my favorite. The guitar on this cd is some of the best I've ever heard. Enormous props to Dimebag Darell. BUY THIS CD!
4,"Nothing much change, But still great.","When listening to this and comparing it with Southern Trendkill there isn't much difference, not to say that's a bad thing they still sound great with the vocals and guitars, but i would've thought they might have change a bit over the four years between CDs. I guess it's better to stay with what we like, no problem with that. The best one on this cd for me was Death Rattle with it's wicked vocals. Great Music!"
3,By far not their best.,"Pantera's back after four long years and the result, a some what disapointing album. Pantera is one of my favorite bands of all time, yet this album is lacking. It's just VERY, VERY, LOUD. Don't get me wrong, I love music that's loud and heavy, but some of Pantera's best songs were soft in some parts (This Love, Cemetery Gates, Hollow.) It's different from what you would expect it's heavy of course but Dimebag's solo's just don't stand out as much. There's only four or five significant songs on the album and those are Hellbound, Goddamn Electric, Revolution Is My Name, and We'll Grind That Axe For A Long Time. An okay album but by no means great."
4,not bad for its kind,"just what i expected from pantera. not really up my alley, but pantera's one of the best heavy metal rock bands i know out there. definitely a worthy investment."
4,Bounty Tracker,"Matthias Hues did an exeptional job with this character and bringing Erik Gauss to life from the script pages. Lorezo Lamas did a fine job but could have shown more of his experience that he has aquired over the years. The martials arts was performed well and executed with percision. Technique was very well done. I found the plot to be suspensful and action packed. There were, in my opinion no lulls in the script. All in all, definately one of Matthias Hues' best movies to date."
5,I am a D Smith fan,"If you have not listened to Darden Smith you are missing a one of the solid talents in music today.The song Mary is a wonderful set piece about love, parenting and what we gain and lose in our relationships."
5,A good summary of a noteworthy career,"This is an ideal intro album for those wanting an album that covers the range of Baez's career, but one that also updates the material she had recorded on Vanguard pushing 40 years ago. The duet/coffee house approach with assorted artists works well with the women Baez chose to include on this album; among my favorites are the duets with Tish Hinohosa, the Indigos, and Dar Williams. If you haven't listened to Baez for a number of years, this is the album to reintroduce you to what is still the best voice in the business. The years have been extraordinarily kind to her voice, as evidenced in this album."
4,Joan's best,"This is my favorite Joan baez CD. On one track she sings with the Indigo Girls. Another great song.....""And the Band Played Waltzing Mathilda"" is a haunting anti-war ballad. Only song I don't like (and which I have never liked) is ""Jesse."""
1,Defective Product,My son is an avid Cleveland Browns fan and bought this controller. Right away we discovered it didnt work. We were please when the seller replaced it without charge quickly. The second controller was only used about a dozen times before it also stopped working. I would suggest not buying this product because of the poor quality and its definately not worth it. We still have to go buy a new controller.
3,Good value for money,"The performance of both artists is superb. The picture quality and sound, excellent. If you like this kind of music buy it and you will not be disappointed."
3,Good but....be careful,"Well, this is Not a bad product, but what about the spare parts, as Gasket , Handle and Pressure Control, where Can I buy these parts? Uh... sometime is better not to buy 'rare' products if you don't know where you are going to get the spare parts."
1,Gasket breakage/ New assembly,"I was so excited to have received this, but a day later the gasket broke after the first use. I went to the manual and called them they said i would have to order the part. that is not under the warranty. OK mabye it was a fluke, kind of chato(annoying) but hey give them a break, the company is from India if I understand correctly. So 11-12 bucks later (cost more for shipping) I received my part (assembly) as they call it. Awesome, worked great! NOT! After the second time using it and following all written directions on the user manual, the same assembly gasket broke. Real quality! Like another user stated, I remained somewhat possitive as I have a decent, expensive stainless steel pot now! Anyway, I will not buy from Mantra again and I would hope that others would see the poor quality of product. Unfortunate circumstances. But as my uncle says. Live and learn!"
5,Love the Xyron!,"If you don't want to use messy glue that can ruin the looks of whatever you create then use the Xyron. It is very easy and fast to run, for example, a flower that you've cut out through the Xyron to put a repositionabe glue on one side/laminate on the other side. You have to turn the handle very slow so you don't have any wrinkles in your ""flower"". It takes a few times to get the hang of it so don't give up! It is a very good product. I have the 9"" for large items, the 5"", 2 1/2"", 1 1/2"" for different sizes of ""flowers"" or what ever your cutouts are. My frustration was ruining the looks of my finished product with glue sticks etc., so that's why I purchased Xyron products and happy that I did."
1,Great for one time,"This is the biggest piece of garbage for the money....works great for 1 time. Then the second time it will only stay at the lowest speed...changed the batteries...no difference..I see this is the second time a post for the same presoblem...BEWARE JUNK!!! Also, these products are non-returnable"
1,No warranty available contrary to what they tell you!,"Be careful if you buy a Corona product and think you are getting a lifetime warranty. I bought this product a few years ago, and when the hickory handle split down the middle, I contacted the Corona Warranty Department to have it replaced. I was told they considered it normal wear and tear and it wouldn't be replaced. What's worse, they told me they don't warranty the handle or the blade on these loppers. When I asked what they do warranty (since it's only a blade and handles), I was told they only warranty it if it isn't working correctly when you purchase it. Doesn't sound too much like a ""Lifetime Warranty"" as advertised. I'd suggest spending your money on a product from a different company that stands behind it and provides a true lifetime warranty as advertised."
1,Second bad one. This one is DOA and they still haven't refunded my money.,"This is the second one I bought. The first lost most of its glow after our housekeeper some left it on for 36 hours. My daughter had only used it <5 hours ( She would turn it on, show her friends, then turn it off) so now you have an idea of their expected life.This one was dead on arrival. I called and got an RMA number. I sent it back but have heard nothing from them and have not received a refund yet. Now I'm going to have to go dig up the UPS see if I still have it and figure out how to contact them.Then I'll have to order another one of these darned things since I owe her one since she had told me about the housekeeper's son using her stuff, and it was a present.Sorry for the sloppy, dictated review but I wanted everyone to know that the product and the vendor are both bad risks even though the concept is neat."
4,review,"it is great....the lighting looks real good, and strong, and looks crazy, just don't drop it....i did....it exploded..... :[......the shipping was good, it came in one piece,"
4,Cool Plasma Ball...,"Pros: Good size, brightCons: base could have been designed better to prevent tiping, expensive for not having audio interactive mode"
1,No Go Right Out of the Box,My son was very excited to receive this as a Christmas gift. Not so excited when it didn't work. Plugged it in. Nothing. Had to return. Won't buy again.
3,Received cracked model,"Mine appeared used and had a crack in it that looked like somebody tried to put adhesive on it. I sent it back! The base is horrible also because it does not balance the sphere well. If you are going to put it in a place for people to touch it, you will need to weight it or add something onto it so it doesn't tip over. Not sure why they put an oval base on something so delicate. Bad design. I returned it due to the crack and bought another brand."
4,Neat item for Christmas,"We got this for our 10 year old son for Christmas. It worked right out of the box. The only problem is that the socket for the cord feels a little loose, so sometimes you have to jiggle the plug to get it to come on. The glass ball definitely is thin and would break easily, although ours has survived 6 months so far. It is pretty neat, but loses some of it's inital appeal after awhile."
4,Satisfied Mom,"After seeing the plasma ball at the local mall my son pleaded to have one. I read all the other reviews understanding the glass is something to be careful with. Overall, we are pleased with the product and value. The Amazon cost was $30 cheaper than the mall price.One odd note is the headache and ringing in our ears after it had been used for a duration of 30 minutes. I'm not sure what that was about but I have asked my son to limit the amount of time he uses it and keep it unplugged when he's not using it."
2,Okay for what it is.,"AUDIO - 4.5/10VISUAL - 4.5/10ACTING - 4.5/10The actors fumbled their lines more than there are sex or murder scenes, the couple of sex scenes -- didnt show anything but upper female. The murder scenes showed hardly any blood. Anyone with a good home video camera and a few friends and their apartments could make this movie.Overall 2.5/5 StarsIt should be a $5 movie -- not a complete waste but I wouldn't watch it again"
3,"Silver, Turquoise Bracelet","I brought this to coordinate with a muli colored turquoise, and coral necklace, it matched color wise but the quality doesnt match the presence of the necklace. It's a lot smaller in person, and crafty."
3,Blonde Redheads,"Not a bad ensemble of their music. However, most songs sound similar - their sound is distinct, original but somewhat mundane after 3 or 4 songs."
3,What happened?,"Having listened to this album a couple of times I felt disappointment. What happened to originality? What happened to the music? I admired Misery Is A Butterfly, the band's previous effort. With the current release though it's become all mere pop."
2,Not so good,I purchased the CD based on hearing one of the tracks. Unfortunately the rest of the CD just didn't do it for me. I think Asobi Seksu does a better job but music is a personal taste so read the other reviews!
2,Doesn't work well,"The product doesn't seem to work at all. There is a white film that forms over the paper when you color on it and the ""marker"" on the paper dries. It tells you to wipe it off with a paper towel and that does nothing. The markers don't seem to make any color show up on the paper except random little tiny circles here and there. My two boys 9 and 4 are extremely disappointed."
4,wonderful,This is a great album for those who listen to all of the words. Not many upbeat songs but excellent to the dicerning listener. As a fan of John Berry this album shows us what he is capable of vocally.
3,Ok,90% just dialog of teh captain and a writer working on memorials for the guys in his company that he lost in 9/11.
4,mixed feelings,What I have seen of this movie is good--but we only got 2/3 of the way thru & it quit working--just went to pixels. I had purchased this movie at a Dollar Tree--and it quit about 1/2 way thru. I was really enjoying the movie & wanted to see the ending--so ordered it thru an Amazon distributor. That is the movie that made it 2/3 of the way through before it pixeled. I really think it is a production problem--the DVD seems thinner than all our other movies. Seems to be poor quality. Company name that produced it is PC Treasures--of which it is NOT!! The distributor was very kind & refunded my money.
4,My Drummer Dad Loves It,"So there you go. My Dad is a professional drummer and he uses his wood agogo regularly. It was/is a great gift idea for the drummer, musician, or world culture enthusiast in your life.:)Rock on World!"
3,You get what you pay for ...,For the price you pay its okay. The quality of stuff included are very poor. For someone 5-10 years old it maybe okay because they may not know better but for anyone older it maybe an insult. Its good to if you have a short attention span and would only like to play each game for a few minutes. I dont think these things will last long if you play it for a long time.
5,Really GooD Book!!,"Really Good Book!!Great Delivery,Right On Time For Chrismas Day. My Ex Girl Friend Loved IT As Her Chrismas Gift :)Thanks Amazon(first Time Buyer By The Way)."
3,thermodynamics in math language,I used this book for a graduate thermodynamics class. It is written in math so if you have a hard time reading math then your in trouble. I suggest taking alot of notes in class bc this book is not going to help much unless you already have a pretty good idea of what to do. At least its small
1,Mamaof2littleones,"My daughter just received these for her birthday and when we opened them, they were completely dried up. Contacted Crayola and they responded that they don't manufacture them anymore. Save your money and buy other markers."
2,"Cool idea, badly done","These just don't work. They still dry out even twisted shut. My biggest problem with them is that they are not washable. If you have a kid that is too young to keep track of caps, then they probably need washable markers too. I cannot recommend these, but loved the idea. Too bad it just didn't work."
3,Disapointed,Since when does TINK have Green hair? Since they made the series of plates for her i guess. the plate is not made as nice as you would expect from a collective plate series.
4,Not the greatest...,"I bought this action figure wondering how they would pull it off...and i must say, they did a fine job. Not very articulated so there isnt a whole bunch of joints and seams.The detail is nice until you get to the crown. His crown isnt as big as the one in all of the pictures. And it's made of a flimsy plastic, so it is always bent from careless packaging and cannot be fixed. Same with the swords...i spent time searching through all of them to find one without bent swords.Not a bad action figure, but could've been better."
5,Twilight Ringwraith,"This Wraith looks great with his glittering robes to make him seem more ghostly. One hand is outstretched like he is reaching for the ring. Despite his coolness, I've had some problems with standing him up. His legs are at an odd angle, so after a while he topples over. This can easily be solved by leaning him against something. Although, overall its a good buy."
2,Not a very good toy,"This toy has so much rubber hanging all over it, that you can hardly move him. His face is ridiculus, and his morgul blade is always falling out of its sheath. I have no idea why they call it the Twilight Ringwraith, because that name is never mentioned in the book or the movie. Not a great toy."
4,Try to read before your trip,Great summary of history and methology with a few recipes to spice up your visit or perception of Finland. Best to read it before you visit.
2,UUUHHHMMM??? NO THANKS,"MY FIRST LANSDALE WAS """"THE BOTTOMS""""--I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY DARN GOOD.I DID NOT LIKE THIS ONE HARDLY AT ALL--THE HIGHLIGHTS WERE""""TRAINS NOT TAKEN"""" AND """"TIGHT LITTLE STICHES IN A DEAD MAN'S BACK"""".ALL OF THE REST??? I HAVE THE FIRST TWO HAP & LEONARDS LINED UP---BUT---I'M THINKING I MAY BE DONE WITH LANSDALE AFTER THEM."
5,Bad ... vampire novel,"I for one enjoyed this quite a bit. I had stumbled upon the comics when they first came out(even got a letter published in the last one) and was floored. The depth of history and the staggering medical terminology, combined with well thought-out and amazing characters make a entertaining read. After eagerly awaiting the release of the novel, and waiting, and waiting, I was overjoyed that the author had expanded further upon the story. I can't wait for further novels. Alas, if only Rhian was a character in the Anita Blake universe, what a crossover that would be..."
5,great read,this is a great read! a new twist to the vampire lore that was never boring nor cheesy. i absolutely loved it!
4,Good info,"I decided to become a party planner, then bought this book. It really helped with basic information on how to start the business. I recommend this book."
5,Titan stablemax wheels.,These are 3.3inch not 3.8inchThey take tires like on T-maxx 2.5They are offset more than an inch which makes the vehicle over 2 inches wider.The 3.3inch tires don't come with foam inserts and are of harder compound.14mm hubs like on t-maxx 3.3.They look really nice.
2,Talk Talk - Talk About a RARE SONG,"I have been tempted recently to buy this album for *just one song* that is nearly impossible to find: Talk Talk's Why is it So Hard. This mega-dance-maker should be re-titled Why is it So Hard to Find this Song? At least Sedated in the 80's Volume 4 has it. The only other source I have found is on the First Born soundtrack (1984) which is equally as difficult to find. Regardless of its rarity frustrations, The Talk Talk song blows all these other 80's ""B sides"" out of the water. I'm thankful for the Sedated in the 80's series for finally making it possible to add this impossible song to my collection.Graduating Class of '87!"
5,I've been sedated,"best volume of the series. I love I'm the One and Satellite,plus there are many other great songs onthis disc. I differently say buy this!"
5,Creative Idea,"80's compilations are a dime-a-dozen. They lack any real creative spin. Vol. 4 of Sedated in the 80's is definitely the exception to the rule. It has put together a bunch of great B-sides which up to this point were very difficult (if not impossible) to find. Highlights include Talk Talk, The Smithereens, Tears For Fears, The Railway Children, The Dream Academy and World Party. Hopefully, there will be more 80's compilations like this released in the future. I mean, really, how many time do we need ""Everybody Wants To Rule the World"" on yet another ""Best of the 80's cd? (Well, I guess, one more time, because even Sedated in the 80's Vol. 6 falls into that trap by including ""EWTRTW"". Oh, well, you still got Vol. 4 right on!)."
2,With so many to choose from...,"You know you're in trouble when they start filling a cd with live versions, acoustic versions, extended versions and dance remixes. With so much GREAT music from the eighties, how could they not find enough to fill a compilation cd like this? Volumes 1 & 2 are awesome, what happened?"
4,Repetitive but worthwhile,"Cooper is the guy if you are into development - from idea to delivery of the goods - be it a product (widget), software or services. He is a portfolio management guy that will help you wrap your thinking around making investments into ideas that are yearning to make a debut in reality."
1,broken equipment,"The main nut repeatedly falls off and gets lost. My main nut has been lost. I took the lopper to home depot for help but they disassociated themseves from it. All I need is a nut and nut-cover so that the equipment will be useful again. Your design of this thing is very puqish. Help me or I will damn you some kind of way. I think Home Depots policy should more helpful. This is a small piece of equipment. I could visualize bigger problems for bigger equipment. I am sorry that I am complaining about you and Home Depot, but this is my only way to get to Corona."
1,Film Aficionado,"This film shows promise, but the transfer is so abysmal that it completely ruins the viewing experience. The sound is especially bad and annoying. Also, the film doesn't have the ""feel"" of being a complete creative entity. I have read that it was originally released in an extended version, which I would very much like to see."
2,DVD production an insult,"I can only add my own voice to the clamor raised over the poor poor quality of Facets' DVD release. It's difficult to assess the film itself based on such a low-grade presentation. The print has all the appearance of having been transferred directly from a multigenerational VHS tape. It's dark, grainy, blurry, and frustrating to watch. Only the scenes shot in brightest sunlight hint at what might have once been a film of rare beauty. In addition, the DVD offers no special features at all. Finally, the English subtitles are rife with both distracting misspellings (""blackshirsts"" for ""blackshirts"") and translation hexes that vary between merely baffling and downright risible (when the Italians conquer Ethiopia, we are told, ""They'll inseminate it, with work!""). Overall, I must recommend avoiding this DVD, a product so shoddy it makes me leery myself of purchasing any other releases from Facets."
5,ended my pain,"Suffering from wrist pain that would not allow me to pick up anything heavy and sent me wretching with pain when I simply rotated my wrist at a dance class. I suffered for about four months and it seemed to be getting worse not better. Then I researched the web and found a carpal tunnel chat line. Person after person reported surgery that didn't work at all or pain that came back after six months or a year. 3 people used Kate Montgomery's method and all reported success. I purchased the book. I started working the suggested program and had relief in about a week. I was consistant with the program for several weeks. The pain totally went away. I still occasionally do some of the exercises. I have been pain free for over 18 months, now. Please try this before surgery. It worked for me!"
4,This program works.,"I do a lot of knitting and fibercrafts and had to take long breaks from it to recuperate, sometimes days. With these exercises my hands feel fine even after many hours of knitting."
4,Consider this alternative before electing surgery,"If you want to avoid painfull and expensive surgery, read this book first and apply its principles. These are simple routines and self therapy and are all about taking care of your body and reversing the damage already done. Besides using this book, you should also avial yourself of the internet and do some research to educate yourself. I feel that this book is an excellant starting poing."
5,excellent book,"I really like this book. It's easy to read and understand and the exercises work. If you have carpal tunnel, I suggest you start with this book before considering surgery. Surgery should be a last resort because it may or may not fix the problem. I can't say my carpal tunnel is cured because I don't believe there is one but it is much better if I follow these exercises consistently."
4,The best album to run to,"This is such a wonderfully happy-sounding and tuneful effort by Stephin Merritt that it's almost possible to forget that he probably doesn't mean any of it. All the songs sound like happy synths with happy lyrics (""You wave goodbye/ airplanes draw swords in the sky"" goes ""The Trouble I'm Looking For""). Only the soaring epiphany of ""Take Ecstasy With Me"" really gives any sonic variation, but you know what? With a sound as happy as this, it hardly matters."
5,Their Second Wonderful album....,"and arguably the best of the early ones (if not the best of all of his). Holiday is a wonderful synth pop album which ranks up there with 69 Love Songs as their best. This opened my ears to alot of synth pop music.The album starts of with the 22 second long intro, which has a sixties-meets-synth sound to it (i think) and is followed by 13 brilliant tracks. All You Ever Do Is Walk Away is one of the best vocal performance from Stephin Merritt and also ranks as one of his best songs. Other highlights are Trouble I've Been looking For and Take Ecstacy With Me.Buy this and 69 Love Songs for the perfect grasp of the best of this band."
5,this is an amazing cd.... in the all time top 5....,"if youre going to get a magnetic fields album... this is the one to get. its an amazing record you could never get tired of. the cd has an electropop indie rock feel that blends very well with steven merritt's voice. if you like them, try: belle and sebastian, the pet shop boys, the smiths, the velvet underground, sebadoh, helium, and even polvo. this album is AMAZING. so there."
2,for Rosealba Neri fans,"Rosealba Neri was a tremendously beautiful and wsxy actress in her prime. this movie shows all of her charms throughout. admittedly that isn't a very PC reason to watch a movie, but the title Slaughter Hotel should give an indication that this isn't ""The Piano"" or ""Remain of the Day"". As giallo's go, the story isn't that good, but there is a lot of nudity and some gore. But there is Rosealba in her prime."
3,Slaughter Hotel (1971),"Dr. Francis Clay (Klaus Kinski) is the head doctor at an asylum that houses suicidal and mentally disturbed women. Hired by a wealthy socialite who's also a patient, Dr. Clay tries desperately to cure his female patients.But when a cloaked killer begins brutually murdering the asylum's patients, the ""good"" doctor finds himself numbered among the suspects.An erotic, sometimes violent Italian movie."
5,Foyle's War,"I received and have viewed set 6 of Foyle's War. I was so disappointed when Mr Kitchens decided to do only 5 seasons of this excellent series.But then I saw that he had been convinced to add these 3 shows as a kind of post-script. This is an outstanding series of well-researched and superbly acted crime-dramas. Here in America, very few know of this show which is a tragedy as it is beautifully done. Kudos to all involved."
2,Disappointing comeback,"Foyle's War was overall one of the best detective series I've ever seen. Much of its appeal resided in the profoundly refreshing integrity of the main characters. Apparently, the writers forgot this in bringing it back. Not only are the scripts not as well-written, but the writers seem bent on making the characters presumably more ""human"" by having them do or confess to things that are not only unnecessary to the plot but utterly out of character from what we've come to expect of them from the first 5 seasons. As excited as I was to hear of more episodes, it was a disappointing comeback."
3,Foyle's War,"This series was not as good as the first. Although the characters were the same,their personalities did not seem consistent with first series."
3,Not So Good,"Unfortunately, not up to the standards of the first five in the series. Series Six seems to be almost an afterthought. Even three stars is a little stretch."
4,Episodes in Set 6?,"Since SERIES 6 was in SET 5, what episodes are in SET 6? Are they SERIES 7 (2010)?"
2,Disappointing,"On the upside, the physical discs for season 6 are of higher quality than their Foyle's War predecessors, and the inclusion of SDH subtitles -- lacking in the earlier seasons -- is a plus for American ears unaccustomed to British intonations. On the downside, there are no extras at all in the season 6 DVD set -- not even the brief textual afterthoughts of seasons 1-5 -- to explain the postwar historical context (certainly needed for these three episodes) or to comment on the production. Neither the acting nor the scripts in season 6 are up to the high standards of the wartime episodes. With one or two exceptions, the actors seem bored and just going through the motions -- even the great Michael Kitchen just phones it in this time around and seems desperate to retire Foyle even more than Foyle wants to retire. R.I.P. Foyle's War -- like the United Kingdom itself, it was great while the war lasted, then sadly fell into decline."
3,continuing series,"This set is no where near as good as the war series. Whenever they have broken up the team, it just doesn't work.The series is okay, but this is a rental not a keeper."
5,More to come for Inspector Foyle in America?,"The final episode of Set 6 ends with Foyle getting on a ship taking American soliders back to America after the end of World War II. It seems strange, at first, but then one remembers the episode entitled ""50 Ships,"" I believe, in which an American businessman killed an English citizen. The American had ""stole"" the idea for synchro-mesh gears from its inventor when they were both students at Oxford years ago. As ususal, Foyle solved the crime but couldn't arrest the American because he was vital to England's obtaining help from American before December 7, 1941. The final scene has Foyle telling the American as he boards a plane that ""someday the war will be over and I shall come to America and get you"" or some such statement. We can only speculate why Foyl was boarding that American troop ship after the end of WWII in the episode, ""The Hide,"" but I like to think that Foyle is making good on his promise to track down that American businessman."
3,Afterthought,"I own Series 6. I must say that I, along with many others, was disappointed when the series ended, but it is obvious that season five was supposed to be the end.. After all, the name of the series is ""Foyles War"". I get the impression that this series was made due to demand for more, but it is a real disappointment. The original series family is nearly destroyed with departure of several members of cast, and weakness in the plots. The things described did happen, as far as racism and such, but the way it is portrayed, does not help the plots.I really think this series was an ""Add on"", and was a waste of money. A shame, because I really enjoyed original series."
4,A murder series set in WW2 England,"An interesting series that is set in WW2 England, and there is no attempt to cover up the fact that they hated their enemey. Political Correctness is no so eveident. This is really just a side bar as the series is about a detective who has to work with war time shortages to solve murders. A real solid series, with great sets and a real feel for the time."
5,More British Mystery,This series is serious and touches on many issues that touched the British people during war besides war. It is not offensive and not obscene. Foyle is one of my favorite characters and Kitchen always delivers.
4,not so much,"At the end of ""set 5"" this series was brought to a more or less satisfying conclusion. Now, with ""set 6"", it was brought back with three more episodes that don't quite live up to the excellence of the previous 5 ""sets"". Don't get me wrong, these episodes are still very good, but just not quite excelent. And the ""ending"" was much less satisfying. But maybe it isn't the end after all, with rumors of the series being continued later in 2012. It may not be Foyle's ""war"" anymore, but at least it will still be Foyle, and there is something to be said for that."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST IS FOYLES WAR,"BEST WRITING ACTING STORY LINE SEEING ENGLAND LEARNING HISTORY OF WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH ALL OF IT. i'VE OWNED IT FROM THE BEGINNING AND ONLY ALLOW MYSELF TO WATCH IT ONCE IN A YEAR,EVEN THEN THERE'S SO MUCH TO IT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY GET TIRED OF IT. THANKS FOR CONTINUING TO GIVE US THIS GREAT PLEASURE"
5,Foyle's War Set 6,"I am a World War II buff and have all six sets of this wonderful program. Set six takes place just at the end of the War, but nothing is back to normal. There are a lot of problems that exist for citizens in this town. Lack of jobs, widespread destruction of buildings due to bombing,and adding to the mayhem are cases of murder. Mr. Foyle has being trying to retire and was forced to return to his job as Chief Inspector because of shortage of qualified staffFoyle's War: Set Six. However, Mr. Foyle always gets his man or woman responsible for the crime. This series has been a wonderful snapshot of life during World War II. The characters are engaging, acting is excellent, and stories believable. This set is certainly worth the time and money. Hopefully, there will be another set explaining why Mr. Foyle has been trying so hard to travel to the US."
4,excellent,"I am probably like you, and grew up hearing Bobby Darrin's ""Mac The Knife,"" the staple left on 1980s oldies radio.But for early 1960s rock, Mac had quite the charm. Mixing jazz and rock when Bobby Vinton was making puppy cudos. And when I sawBeyond the Seawhere Kevin Spacey plays Bobby, my best suspicions were vehemently confirmed: This Bobby Darrin was a pretty cool guy.Now I'll confess of this twofer, I have only Oh! Look At Me Now"" on vinyl, not available individually on Amazon. But let me tell ya, this is more than enough to start gnawing on the Darrin bone.Billy May, who did a lot of Sinatra's brassier outings, co-pilots here, and alternates tracks between ""Mac""-like swing and 1950s style coral tracks. Darrin can swing and croon and when he does either, it is with a cool, direct delivery. There is never paint eating and never maple syrup. And it works every time.Oh Look At Me Now is the only Bobby Darrin I have, but it sure won't be the last one."
1,Did not receive merchandise,"According to this seller, my order was shipped one month ago but I did not receive the item yet. The seller won't respond to my emails. Not recommendable. I hope to get my money back from Amazon."
5,Up and coming artist!! Great CD,"A friend of mine loaned me this CD...let's just say that I now own *all* of Catie Curtis' work. She is a remarkable songwriter who is still developing. This is her most raw, unpolished work, but i like it that way. ""Troubled Mind"" is one of the best ballads i've heard in a long time.Crash Course in Roses is also a great album...If you like folk / singer-songwriter acoustic music, you'll love all her work."
3,"A concise, but limited course","This booklet and tape set is not the most complete language set you will find, but it is adequate if you are in a hurry to pick up some of the language. I found the tapes to be most useful. Most of it is just repetition til it's drilled into you."
3,Norwegian Language,"The tape is not the greatest if you are just starting from scratch, but it is helpfull. It doesnt help you that much with the structure and set up of the Norwegian Language, it simply repeats phrases over and over. However, I am still using it and I find it help full. The Phrase book also has usefull information."
2,Zippered pouch. No more - no less.,"The technical details say it is...* Convenient storage for pliers, wrenches, screwdrivers, nut drivers, other tools and spare parts.The description says...*Great for transporting contracts, quotations, work orders, plans, and schedules.You certainly wouldn't want to try to carry any type of tools (or anything else for that matter) along with your contracts, work orders, etc, since there is absolutly no storage other than the main compartment.It is very light weight, but the material seems like it is very strong. If you have car keys, an MP3 player, anything of that nature to carry around along with paperwork, this isn't going to work for you. I should have not assumed there would be storage pockets and just kept shoppping. My bad."
4,Kind of slow but a good read!!,"Harlequin HistoricalsAdventure! The Seattle air crackled with it, making Emily Kendall's blood race. Coming West as a mail-order bride had been the most outrageous thing she'd ever dared. Until she was faced with the deliciously shocking possiblities posed by Austin Matthews- the one man in town not shopping for a wife! Things started off kind of slow but by the end I was sorry to put it down!"
5,Must have for your IQAir,"These replacement filters are the Official IQAir Coarse pre-filters PF40. They arrived in an official IQAir box with the IQAir Logo Tape sealing the top. They are inexpensive (unlike the prefilter system), you get 5 for $50, so why even bother trying to wash the old ones out.The amount of dust these trap and thus prevent from clogging the much more expensive preMax filter is amazing. They extend the life of the preMax by months. They are well worth the expense. Just remember to change them often. I change mine about every 6-8 weeks.I love them and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND them."
5,"A ""MUST-HAVE"" if you have animals","We have 3 dogs and 2 cats, and adding the Coarse Dust Pre-Filter to our IQAir unit has made a HUGE difference in its overall efficiency (and will undoubtedly extend the life of the unit itself). I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone that has pets in the same space filtered by the IQAir."
1,Defective Product: Not Worth $42.00!,"I bought this whistle based on the product description of it being a loud siren noisemaker. Instead, it makes a (passable) wheeeeeeeee! sound as in the old Looney Tunes cartoons when a machine malfunctions. I used this whistle for (at most) seven times, when it stopped working! In another product description on amazon, it states that this item is made with ""a watchmaker's precision."" The watchmaker must have been asleep at the switch when this one was made. Supposedly, cyclists in England used to blow this whistle in order to clear the road ahead of them. The sound will only produce laughter if you tried it in the U.S.. For forty two dollars, I recommend any other whistle (i.e. the Acme thunderer) besides this one. I sent this whistle back for a replacement; the company refunded my purchase price instead."
4,Intimidating,It's intimidating the idea of reviewing such a legendary reviewer. Reading the unguarded words of this author and epic book reviewer was interesting. Her ability to describe the people and scenes around her coupled with her devotion to her journals captured my attention for 327 pages.
5,High quality,Now THIS is a high quality pair of pruning shears! Very pleased with the quality of this product. Looks much more substantial than all the ones I've bought at the usual hardware stores. I am so tired of wasting money on pruning shears. The last pair I bought at Wal-Mart lasted all of two minutes. They broke on the first couple of clips. Back they went to the store! Someone at the nursery where I go to buy plants recommended this brand to me. Said she'd owned them for years and years and that they had heavy duty usage and continued to last. I had to find them online but did so on Amazon and now they are mine! I expect them to last a long time. I will come back and amend this review if they do not.Corona Clipper BP 3160 3/4-Inch Capacity Bypass Pruner with Vinyl Coated Steel Handles
2,Sturdy but rusts!,It's a very sharp and sturdy pruner but it's not rust free! The blades have rusted all over. How can a quality garden tool not be rust free?
5,My most used gardening tool,"I never even venture out for a garden job without this in my pockets. I mis-use it for everything from cutting weeds to pruning trees. The design looks ""basic"", but this really is a very well made product. The blades are sharp and have remained sharp. They haven't rusted - even though I am terrible at taking care of them. The curved blade design is just great - gives you increased cutting power as compared to the ""V"" shaped blade. I think this is the first gardening tool you really should buy. I'm now trying ""Corona"" for my other tools - having had good experience with their pruner."
2,Could've been better...,"Wasn't sure what to think about this movie, it seemed kinda like a ""Do The Right Thing"" kinda movie but without Spike Lee's influence. So you have Trina who's tired of all the thug'ism going on in her neighborhood, so she gets all the girls together & they cut off the guy's sexually & physically by camping out on the basketball court. That's about all I can say without completely ruining the story. The whino's were pretty funny & the girls all looked pretty good, specialy Neferteri Shepherd, she was smokin."
3,Unbelievable,"This is a decent movie unbelievable, but still decent,some of it is worthy of attention and some of it is plane nonsense, this is a movie for purely entertainment, in that reguard it's decent"
2,Ok Film,"this film ain't what you would expect from Trina.this film was like Do The Ring Thing meets,waiting to Exhale,meets Friday&Barbershop with a blend that took elements of all those films&gets a bit too Cluttered for it's own Good.still the film had a good message&the ladies in this film make my head blow up like Popeye to Spinach."
3,Okay movie,Trina is playing a great smart character in this film and so is Sommore the comedian from comic view. It was very low budget and children under sixteen should'nt see this movie unless view by adult first.
3,Good Way To Break Into Acting,Thsi movie is good.Im proud Of Trina for making a stand in this movie.She isnt her normal self it is swithced around.Meaning that in this movie is practicing not having sex in exchange for no violence in the community.there arew some alright actors in here and some good ones.This movie is no BLockbuster to be released in the movie theaters but it does work for her starring role.Overall if ya a Trina fan you should have this or have seen itOVERALL GRADE 78/100 = C+
2,Not so much for me!,( spoiler alert) Sure the heroine was rude too the extreme at the beginning when she was society queen but I don't think she deserves to be treated this way when she lost everything. There was not a real connection between the protagonists in this book. Only heavy sexual tension which never really replaced romance.
3,Not feeling it,"This book was very middle of the road. Nothing too objectionable, but not particularly memorable, either. There was detailed discriptions of sexual acts, but not much focus on the emotional journey. Sexy, but not at all romantic."
1,Where's the sample clips?,"Well, I've read good reviews of this album and would like to hear it... but I'm sick of getting ripped off with the $15 gambles. There are no sample clips online here, nor on the record label's web site. Actually, Amazon seems to be the ONLY place to even buy this cd - I've looked in 3 stores, no one had it. Here's some advice to Kid606 - sample clips sell cd's, get some online. Otherwise what's to stop people from downloading the mp3's for free?"
5,A Fabulous Collection from a Hugely Gifted Vocalist,"I'm 34 years old now and back in 1987 when I took note of Nancy Wilson for the first time since the seventies, thanks to a special on A&E, I had thought she was just another singer, one whose appeal I never understood on the few occasions I heard her perform when I was a child. I guess she was a big deal back in the sixties, but I think people forgot how great her recordings are and how good they still sound. This cd is a great representation of her talent."
5,Fantastic. I'm in Love,"If you are going to buy but one Nancy Wilson Album, this is all you need.Excellent love songs from her Capitol (and best) years."
4,Usefull,"This is a useful little piece of equipment, but more so for odd jobs, not at all a replacement for a drill press. Build quality is good."
2,Not accurate at all,"I am disappointed with this device.Cross guide plays a little but most loose comes from chuck assembly which is not ball bearing but simple bushing. Due to its small length, the play of 1/16"" in the bushing comes to 1/6"" at the drill end.I expected better drill quality."
3,Does what it says,"I drilled more than 100 holes into aluminum tubing. Made this task of true centered holes easy and accurate.The chuck key could easily be lost so had to tie it with a lanyard to the unit.The smoothness of the arms did get a bit sticky after heavy use. I have not cleaned them yet.The bolts that hold the uprights to the base are too short. I had to replace these bolts with longer ones, the original shorter ones stripped out early during use.I would buy another unit (at <$30) if posed with the same task."
4,Not quite a drill press...,"It is what it is, and it's not a drill press... but it's probably the next best thing. It doesn't take up much room, and it keeps the holes straight and allows me to set them to where I want them. It's a little wobbly, hence the 4 stars as opposed to 5, but I wasn't expecting to use this in place of a high end drill press. Something to keep in mind; it really only works for wide surfaces. Sure, you could make a jig to widen the base that it sits on, but that's a lot more work than just using a drill press and clamping the work down... Of course, when you don't have a drill press, I guess it could work. Personally though, if it comes down to making a jig, I'll generally figure out how to make a pocket hole work which is much easier! All in all, it's not a replacement, but it'll do in a pinch!"
2,Very Low quality materials.,"I bought this to drill holes for the balusters in my deck rail. It worked great for about the first 10 holes then the poor materials used by WoodCraft came screaming through. Here are the issues:1. Plastic black handle broke off2. A LOT of slop in the drill bit mechanism means a LOT of imprecision in your holes. The entire reason I bought the thing.3. The chuck must be made of pop metal as the teeth have broken off and I can no longer tighten the bit using the included chuck wrench.4. Difficult to set correct angles.5. The required technique for centering the bit on the board isn't robust. Combined with the loosey goosey nature of the tool, you're mostly on your own for obtaining a center position with the bit.Essentially, it's good as a bit stop and that's about it."
3,better than drilling freehand,"The adjustable angle means it takes some work to get it set perpendicular to the base. The base isn't very well designed, it's got cutouts in the bottom that make it hard to use on anything but a large, flat surface. I ended up removing the springs.In summary: it's better than trying to drill freehand, but there's room for improvement."
2,Disappointing,"The first one I received had an off-center hole for the handle attachment and would not allow the handle to be screwed into the nut. This one was returned. The replacement arrived and I was able to attach the handle. However, the chuck key provided does appear to be the correct size - it is almost useless in trying to tighten the chuck. Also, the quality of construction is much lower than I expected and it requires a lot of tweaking simply to get the drill bit at 90 degrees to the base.My expectations were fairly low to begin with, but this product did not come close to what I anticipated."
3,It will hold the drill in a pinch,"The drill guide worked just well enough for what I needed to do. The drill bit does wobble a little bit on the rails since they are a little too small, so delicate work is not recommended. I used it to drill some plugs for filling screw holes, and it worked as long as I did not drill too deep. If I let the bit get too far the play between the bit and the frame was enough that the bit broke the plug while drilling. I would imagine with hole drilling it would be somewhat the same and a small drill bit may break. If I had space I would buy a full-size drill press but attaching this to a piece of wood worked for now."
1,Over heated,After eight 5/8 holes with hole saw in a 2X4 the item seized up causing drill kick back (bruising my arm).
3,wolfcraft drill guide,Overall the drill guide will do what I want it to do in my shop. One thing I don't like is I have to remove the springs to set the depth gauge stop. This means the springs are setting around some where I sometimes forget where I put them.
1,Sadly...it's junk...,"Assemble it as directed and it still has too much ""slop"" in the fit of all the pieces. There's no way to get a true 90 perpendicular hole. I tried drilling ~ 20 perpendicular holes in a 2x6 for a project for my daughter. After drilling the holes, it was very obvious they weren't perpendicular. Save your money and apply it to a floor standing or table-mount drill press."
3,Same as what Sears sells now,"Haven't used it yet, but Sears sells this under the Craftsman brand with the only difference being all plastic bits are black.Would also like to see if I can replace the chuck with a keyless 1/2"" one."
5,Just as represented.,Every thing it was supposed to be. A great little handy aid in aligning your drill for a perfect job.
3,Portable drill angle guide,"This guide works well for starting a mortise hole at an angle, but it has a bit of a flaw in that there is a bit too much play in the spring joints, allowing for a minute amount of wobble--meaning that your angle might be a bit off side to side. This was only an issue for me when using a glass drill bit where a drill press was not an option. It allowed for a tiny bit of imprecision and wandering of the bit. This just isn't a tool for fine detail, but works GREAT for most drilling. You just have to be careful using it."
2,Drill shaft not true,I bought this to drill holes through posts to run cable railing. The shaft that holds the chuck and attaches to the drill is not true. There is a slight warp so the bit wobbles just enough so the bit does not drill easily. The product works but not as good as I expected. I should have sent it in for a replacement but I needed it right then.
2,Not a drill press replacement,"I bought this to drill multiple shallow holes in the vertical sides of an entertainment center to use shelf pins for maximum shelf adjustability. For drilling the same holes repeatedly and wanting them the same this is just not the best tool. As stated by others the springs are too stiff, especially for a large number of holes (80) which will wear your arms out. The instability of the base combined with the lean ""flex"" of the guide rods caused as you apply the extra pressure you have to because of the springs make the difference between drilling by hand and using this device basically undetectable. I would have to say, if you're not that concerned, just drill by hand and if you want anywhere near precise, get a drill press of a better intermediate attachment."
2,Flimsy,"Kind of flimsy. Works OK with a light-cordless drill. Wobbles a lot I use one of the heavier ones, ending up with imprecise drilling. Gave up on it and hand-drilled the rest (slower but with the same level of precision!). So, if you want precise drilling go for a proper drill press."
3,DON'T EXPECT MIRACLES,"This was purchased specifically to put holes in round stock. The vees were not deep enough to hold 1"" stock securely, but it sort of worked. However, the chuck was not centered over the vees, so holes were off position. The slide/chuck assembly has so much play it was not possible to hit a mark within +/- 1/4"". I could have done much better without it. In short, this will not deliver anything close to an accurate perpendicular hole in anything."
4,Good product,"I was very pleased with this Drill Guide. I think it did all that it was supposed to do. Inexpensive though it may be, it made my job easy. Money well spent!"
2,Wolfcraft 4525404 Drill Guide Attachment for 1/4-Inch or 3/8-Inch...,Wolfcraft 4525404 Drill Guide Attachment for 1/4-Inch or 3/8-Inch...The bearings flew out after 10 minutes of use. Amazon sent me a replacement which I haven't used yet. May be OK for very light occasional use.
3,now I need to order a UK dvd player :),Ignorance is bliss. The cover looks great! I can vaguely remember the episodes fromwhen I first watched them years ago...by the looks of it that is about as far as this purchasewill go. The dvds are only compat with a UK player. Maybe next Christmas I will order one.
2,No Help for Stressed Dog,"Tried it for separation anxiety. Didn't seem to make a difference. Using a ""treat ball"" worked better (that she has to work as a puzzle to get kibbles)."
2,Dsappointed,"My vet recommended it for my skitish dog. Might have helped 10%, but that might just be wishful thinking. Dsappointed."
3,DAP Collar,"Not exactly the collar I was looking for. Manufacturer has changed the collar for their own reasons but it seems to be working Okay, not quite as well as the older type , in my opinion but their are very few on the market so I will have to be satisfied."
3,You may want to try it.,"I notice a very subtle difference in my dog's general demeanor. He seems to be a little less agitated and a little less excitable, but that could just be my imagination. Maybe it's doing nothing, but he seems a little more mellow. You will not notice a huge difference, but give it a shot for a month. As other reviewers mentioned, this is no miracle."
2,"At First, You'll Love It...But, Beware There After!","Though this review is based on the Dell Pocket DJ, a few of my friends had similar complaints about this product, as well.When I first bought this product a year ago, it was a pleasure using it. I felt special because no one else had one, as most people were going ""goo-goo, ga-ga"" over the iPods.Well, the honey moon came to an end just about six months into ownership.PROBLEMS & ISSUES:1) The bottons started sticking2) After plugging the device into my computer to rip music, it crashed the computer twice.3) The device froze on me several times4) The head phones went out on me; had to replace them.5) The ""Juke Box"" software, though easy to use, stopped syncing to the device. I had to end up using Windows Media to sync."
5,Splendid ending,"I loved the first 2 books and was not disappointed by this one. A slow start, but Korr's sudden attack puts Jan in a frenzy to end the maddness and learn the dark secret behind his father's tormented mind.There are spectacular battles with the wyrms and a young unicorn rises to become an unlikely heroine.All the lose threads are wrapped up and there is a happy ending."
5,One of the Best Books I've ever read!,"I love this book! Jan is the ultimate hero! I've only read this book of the trilogy and it was a little hard to swallow at first. I had a little trouble with the plot at the begining and I was able to piece it together at the end. I love the way that this book portreys unicorns as more human characters, instead of cute and cuddly plush toys. I love this book and would recomned it to as one!"
5,Majestic score from an underrated masterpiece,A superior release in terms of sound quality over the original Rhino release . George Stevens always said that he was not making a film for the moment but for the ages. He was correct. Forty years later the film seems richer than ever and the controversial casting of stars is no longer as jarring as it may have first appeared. The film was intended as a pageant and a poetic meditation about mankind's greatest story using references to iconic images from art . The film and its score have survived the negative critical Reaction of 1965 . Now if only the film could be restored to it's original premiere version.
5,Alfred Newman,"Anything by Alfred Newman is a real classic.The writing, the conducting, and the playing are the elements that set a very high standard that is not always heard in the later movies. And as of Jan 2013 that standard has been lowered many times.The movie scores, many times, are ""cookie cutter"" approaches that rely too much on over-processed percussion samples and phrases. I'm tired of the ""dumbing-down"" of the typical movie goer. And what has become the ""norm"" only sets the expectation at a lower level. How's that for you ""evolution only"" people?"
4,Delightful performances,I've been a Chet Atkins fan most of my life. In my latter years I've come to admire his technique even more as I try to mimic it on my own guitar. This DVD includes a collection of masterful performances that I had never seen before. Watching this DVD reveals Chet growing older and yet he remains relaxed and steady through some of his more demanding performances. I had to watch it several times over. This makes me want to order the other DVDs in the series.
4,In White America,"This used book was in good condition. It is probably out of print, so I felt lucky to find a copy of it. As a documentary play, it gives original narratives of black history in America and is very informative and moving. My church is planning to perform the play, as it originally did in the 1960s."
5,Julie Sings The Blues,A great album with a variety of blues tunes done as only Julie can. Very good!
3,all are different sizes,"all are different sizesso they dont all work in your earsome are too bigso its a waste of $$$unless you have 2 different size ear canals,,, then they would be great"
2,I was looking forward to using these,I have the Koss Plug earpiece because they block outside noises but unfortunately it was hard to use them since they were too big to fit in my ear and they kept falling out during my workouts. So when I saw these I was ecstatic and even shouted with glee because I figured that one or more of those sets had to fit my ear right??....well my jubilation was short lived once I tried to use even the smallest cushion because it was still too big for my ear. I rolled and pinched them between my fingers as instructed but they just wouldn't stay in. So I gave them to my husband and of course they fit him. *sigh*
3,Buy from Koss,"These will become necessary if you own Koss Plug or Spark Plug ear buds, as they they wear out after a while.However, you can buy them from Amazon for the current listed price of $9.99 for six pair (approx. $1.67 a pair) or you can buy them directly from Koss in a package of five pair for $5. Now since I live in Wisconsin I had to pay sales tax, so it came out to $5.28 (approx. $1.06 a pair), but that's still lower than Amazon. Either way shipping is free, so I buy directly from Koss."
5,Nice replacements,"I have been a fan of the Koss Plug ear buds for some time, over 10 years I believe. I actually got my first pair by accident because the store I got them in didn't have much of a selection of noise isolating ear buds at the time. I loved the fact that beyond sounding good the came with 2 pair of replacement cushions. Nice, someone actually believes their product will last long enough that replacements will be needed and they did. Now I find even more replacements so no telling how long they will last now cause that was the only flaw I found with them. The cushions would get hard and start to lose their seal after repeated use day after day. These may even get me through another 10 years."
2,The Profitable Retailer,"While I didn't disagree with any concepts in the book, based on the reviews that I had read prior to purchasing the book, I thought it was going to be more insightful. After purchasing I found this mainly to be what I consider common sense retail concepts. Overall I was disappointed with the content."
2,Heavy use causes bypass to bypass too much,"This worked wonderfully when I first started using it.I quickly cut branches I would have sawed before or for whichI would have used the chain saw. After two months, the lopperstopped cutting all the way through the branches. It left alittle strip connecting the two parts. I think the heavy sheetmetal hook bent away from the blade, leaving a gap between thetwo. It still cuts easily for 90% of the thickness, but italways leaves a ribbon joining the two. For infrequent or onetime heavy use, this should work fine. Do not plan on usingthis lopper for a lifetime. I suggest considering theprofessional loppers from Corona."
2,Major Design Flaw,"These loppers work great except for one very important thing, they rarely finish a cut. It appears to me that the cutting blade is too soft or too thin and bends away from the hook preventing the last 1/8"" or so from being separated. This compaint has been voiced by others. The overall build of this tool is quite good but if the design is not changed to correct this problem I would not recommend its purchase."
3,bad handles,"Had these for about 1.5 years doing light yard work. They cut fine if you keep the blade sharp, The problem is that the handles begin to fatigue where it connects, and they become soft and unable to close the shears to cut."
2,Only so-so,"I bought this knife with a full set of Mundail's (Brazilian steel).The paring knife is the hardest to keep sharp with a steel, needs frequent stone grinding resharpening, and doesn't keep an edge well.Spend the extra money and buy a Wustoff for the paring knife for your knife assortment. I give my other Mundail knives four stars (I like the fatter handles than the Wustoffs), but at this size for some reason the forging is not well executed and the edge just won't keep. It works, but is frustrating, so I'd recommend avoiding it."
4,"Cool, Swingin' Sounds","Where would the world be without the Ultra-Lounge series? Missing a lot of great collections of wonderful Lounge music and Bachelor Pad Royale is no exception. More great music - maybe a little less consistent than the rest, but a sure bet nonetheless!"
5,I didn't even know i liked jazz till I heard this!,"All these CD's are fabulous, but this ones the best. Harlem Nocturne and Caravan gave me chills. I you like this one, try Crime Scene, it a beaut too."
4,If you like lounge music...,It is best to review all the songs and listen to them if unfamiliar with artist or title. I love and own many of the Ultra-Lounge series.
1,"Ultra-Lounge, Vol 4","I didn't much care for the music. If there were samples that I could have listened to, I probably would not have purchased it."
3,nothing special,"I'm probably one of the few people who own this album. It was actually interesting to come on here and read the previous review. I bought this album when it came out back in 1995. There use to be commercials for it on The Box. This is a Ruthless Records album, released shortly after Bone Thugs-N-Harmony had came out and I was loving them (still do today) so I wanted to check this out. I was so excited when I bought it, and listened to it, but I was instantly disappointed. I guess I was expecting it to be soemthing smiliar to Bone. Also, they had a song called Everyday Thang and Everyday Thang Remix. Its not a horrible album. The rappers are alright. The beats are ok. But definitley nothing special. Even today, when I try to listen to it, I just cant take too much, and then I put something else on. But still cool to have as part of my collection."
3,Good and bad,I found the roller to have very nice rolling bearings and stainless steel rollers. The height adjusting clamp on one unit clamps poorly and the clamping bolt has very stiff thread and is hard to tighten.
2,Worthless,"This is a great idea. But, the construction on the tension mechanism is VERY poor. Found that it will not even support a sheet of particle board. Tightening the adjustment simply stripped the threads making it useless. Would not recommend this item even for an anchor for a row boat!"
5,Fantastic,"This Wolfcraft pedestal roller stand it the strongest construction and beefed up welds I have ever seen in a table/miter saw support system. I comes assembled other than inserting the top half into the square tube frame (all 15 seconds to set up, if that). The height adjustment is as fast as you can spin a knob and lower and raise it to the desired height. I have used many material support systems as a profession carpenter and I recommend this material support highly... I bought it on sale in the 30 dollar range but I see it has dropped to 20 bux with retail being in the 40 dollar range... Buy it, you won't regret it at all..Thanks for reading my review,Sincerely,Larry"
3,Good for the price,"It is very pretty and the charm is hefty. My only observation is that, in my opinion, the chain is too thin/delicate for the charm. I changed it to a more substantial chain that pairs better with the heart."
5,Excellent puzzle,"Fast shipping, great condition, only issue was my puzzle was put together when I opened it, and had to disassemble before I got to play with it! Still worth the effort!"
1,ECO FRIENDLY OR RECORD COMPANY SAVES MONEY?,"The packaging (what there is of it) falls to pieces, the egg-carton tray doesn't hold the CD properly and is already disintegrating, and Universal is too mean to give you a booklet. After all, why should they pay when you can download and print the booklet on your own dime. There are also much better James Brown overviews --- the 50th Anniversary collection is much more diverse and offers better value."
1,Vendor site not reliable. Products listed as in stock when they are out of stock.,"This review is not for the snowshoes themselves, as they were never shipped to me, but for The Sportsman's Guide as an online vendor. I placed my order online and received a confirmation that the snowshoes were available to ship and would ship in 3 days. The day after they were supposed to ship, I received an email notification of a refund of my payment as the snowshoes were out of stock. This vendor needs to improve their online system so that they never list anything as being in stock when it is not. This review is to warn others that this vendor cannot be relied upon and could adversely affect your Christmas shopping."
2,Corona Clippers,These clippers are crap. They broke not long after. I am a serious gardener so I should have known better. I guess for a casual gardener not making heavy demands on their clippers they might be suitable.
2,NOT ur best ODB footage.,"This DVD is a piece of crap that was rejected by Rocafella for release because it is so lame. There is no way you could be a true friend of ODB and feel good about releasing this. He looks like he just got pushed onto the stage in the middle of a drugged-out depression. Budda Monk keeps saying ""Talk to the audience. Talk to the audience."" and Dirt is like ""Naw, man.""I love ODB sooo much, but to release this after he is dead is a cheap shot at making some dollars off of his name.However I will say the bonus interview is crazy good. He's f'd up out of his mind but he speaks some dirty wisdom like you have never heard. I don't know why the other reviewer prefers the live stuff. To me, that just looks like Dirt is depressed and out of his element. He doesn't move around at all and for many of the songs he doesn't sing. It really makes me sad to watch it.RIP old boy."
4,A Chinese porn parody that will surprise you!-,"A young man who enters a paramilitary group that defends the 'authentic Chinese values' discovers rapidly that, at night, the group indulges in (homo)sexual orgies. Every plot move is designed to show more naked Asian males and what's more, the creators don't have the intention to hide their goal. The ending of this short (60 minutes!) soft porn movie is hilarious. Watch out for some unexpected puns in the English subtitles."
2,A Litany of sexual perversions!!!,"This book would have been far better if it were entitled ""Intimate Sexual Perversions of Famous People""! Never in my life have I read such a litany of sexual excess! I'm not one of those people who think that sex is evil, but I do believe that it's a beautiful act of love that should only be experienced in marriage. How sad that many of these famous people didn't have balanced parental and moral guidance in this area. And why did the authors wait until the last chapter and appendix to feature people who had sucessful marriages and healthy sex lives? If we expect future generations to practice marital fidelity, then we need to give more time to writing about people who have suceeded instead of these sad examples."
4,A Hidden Gem,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this book. From the title, one might think it is some sort of sleazy tabloid in book form. But far from it! It's a real treasure trove of interesting information that is not readily available anywhere else.There's nothing sensationalistic about it; rather, the book helps make a large number of well-known names from movies to arts to politics, as well as historical figures from the less-recent past, seem more human and like the rest of us.Each subject is given approximately two to five pages of coverage. Of course I don't have the knowledge to speak about the book's accuracy, but it gives every appearance of being very well researched. Yet despite its almost scholarly approach, it's quite readable and interesting. Highly recommended!(I have the hard cover version.)"
5,THIS WAS A FUN BOOK,I had this book a long time ago and was never able to replace it when it died (or I lost it) I always wanted another copy but could never get one Yay Kindle has it I can get it Yay
3,Impulse Buying,"I remember the title from long ago and had enjoyed several novels by Papa Irving Wallace, so ordered the book. Well, it's OK but nothing you can't live without. It's not for sustained reading, but a book to pick up once in awhile and read a bit of dish about people in history. As a reminder, dear readers, everyone has a 'story' but they are not all interesting."
3,"Cute shoes, but not perfect","I still love the way these shoes look & fit, but whatever the material inside is made of, it makes my feet sweat and even makes the shoes smell. But they are so cute, I bought some shoe spray & have just dealt with it."
1,Invasive.,"The USDA lists this as an invasive species. Imported from Asia, it crowds out native species. The abundant fruit is eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds, but it's not as nutritious a food source for them as the native species Autumn Olive displaces.Sale of this plant seems irresponsible. I wish horticulturists would recognize their responsibility to educate consumers about invasives and their alternatives, rather than continue to sell plants that destroy habitat and alter the landscape - perhaps permanently. It would be a tremendous achievement if vendors would choose not to sell these plants, rather than the government stomping in and regulating sales."
3,BEWARE! NO TRACK LISTINGS!,"A great Monty Python album which I had on LP years ago. Unfortunately, on the CD you can't easily find a favorite skit (and TRAVEL AGENT is on this one! ) because there are only two ""tracks"" representing sides 1 and 2 of the album. Sadly, a terrible CD presentation for a classic comedy album.FYI, the skits are: SIDE ONE: Embarrassment/A Bed-Time Book; England 1747--Dennis Moore; Money Programme; Dennis Moore Continues; Australian Table Wines; Argument Clinic; Putting Budgies Down; Eric The Half A Bee; Travel AgencySIDE TWO: Radio Quiz Game; A Massage/City Noises Quiz; Miss Anne Elk; We Love The Yangtse; How-To-Do-It Lessons; A Minute Passed; Eclipse Of The Sun; Alistair Cooke; Wonderful World Of Sounds; A Fairy Tale"
2,The Godfathers,"The MPFC are the quintessential English nonsense humour, the most talented comic characters & shows of our times owe them something. Their songs are as hilarious as their shows (& that's saying something). You suddendly become aware of the incredible gap between American humour, essentially based on parody, and our fellow Brittons'.As hilarious as a good P.G. Wodehouse novel,as nonsensical as their forerunners, the Goons. They did 1000 times more for the reputation of the United Kingdom than, let's say... The Osbournes or the late queen mum (though her hats wouldn't have been out of place on John Cleese's head)"
1,Disappointed.,The handle broke off my almost new Corona clippers - it looks like metal fatigue. The problem is that the company website says their lifetime warranty will only be honored if the loppers are purchased directly from their website. This seems like it would be a huge negative for their resellers. What difference does it make if it's bought direct or Lowe's or wherever - it's still the same product? I won't buy another Corona because of their warranty restrictions.
5,Decent book,"Good book, has torque specs assembly tips etc. Useful for a first time build. After that, not so much probably."
5,Great book for the beginner,Over all I like the book. I am very glad I bought it. Perfect when it came out a few years ago and most of the info passes on to the Gen 4. I'm looking forward to the next book coming out in Feb. 2007
1,Bad Technical Information!,"I've never seen so much incorrect technical information in one book in my life.In just 30 minutes of reading I found false technical information on pages 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32 and 44.Incorrect information was found in numbers listed for displacements, bore diameters, strokes, rod bore diameters, valve lifts and rod lengths!Another reviewer mentioned that you can't trust many of the part numbers, which I didn't check but I wouldn't be surprised!Because of all the bad information I found, I don't trust the rest of the information in the book!I don't even want to sell or return the book because someone else might trust the information and destroy an engine!This book must be burned!"
5,Man Woman &Child,"I'm a romantic so this film was right up my alley. What makes it so different from every other love story out there is that the love story is between father and son. Martin Sheen finds out he has a son he didn't know he had. Since he's married with a family, you can imagine the chaos this news causes. Add in the fact his son is French and all the cultural differences there are between the French and Americans--hold on to your hats! It's very well acted by Martin Sheen, Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mom--you'll see why Gwyneth is so pretty) and the little boy that plays Martin's son. If you are in the mood for a romantic escape, this film hits the mark dead center."
4,Very good story,This movie goes back many years but still manages to hold together in content and emotional tugging of the heart. Relationship movies are always interesting to me and this is no exception. Martin Sheen gives a marvelous performance as a man who's past suddenly catches up with him. The turmoil that this long-married couple must endure takes the viewer through a realistic situation that could happen to anyone; and probably has to many. The ending is both heartbreaking and uplifting and I think this movie should have done much better than it did when released. Watch it some day and you will see.
2,OK tearjerker,"Sheen discovers that an affair some ten years ago resulted in a child. When the boy's mother dies, Sheen must admit his adultery and get to know the son he never knew he had.Blythe Danner gives a superb performance as Sheen's wife, both incredibly sympathetic and believable in her actions. Sheen doesn't fare as well, playing a rather one-note and not all that likable character. Young Sebastian Duncan does remarkably well in his poorly written role as the youngster who's life changes drastically.Overall; ""Man, Woman and Child"" is an OK tearjerker. The supporting cast is great with ""Coach"" himself Craig T. Nelson playing a sports fanatic (what else!) and the criminally underrated David Hemmings pops up in two scenes. Rather silly and overly sentimental scenes (particularly near the end) hurt the film and while it's never boring, it never quite takes off the way it should.The music is great, though."
2,Great Movie But Ruined By Sappy Ending,"Great acting, Martin Sheen and Blythe Danner both show that although they have offspring in the business, the older generation has the chops.But the ending is a happy one and that feels so tacked-on and sappy. Perhaps some studio heads insisted on it, but it simply does not fit. The movie would be much better if Sheen's family leaves him at the end (maybe temporarily). All stories do not have to end happily."
3,"Man, woman and child",Quality of the movie is really poor. I love the movie but has quite a fuzzy picture. Would not recommend it to anyone.
1,This movie is great to see- if your a masochist.,"I rented the film with my grandparents and some cousins in hopeful anticipation of a good comedy. And while i cant say this too often, i completely despised this film! My grandpa mentioned that he wasted 2 hours of his life, and he spoke for everyone who was in the room watching the movie. I mean, come on? Who destroys an evolution of beasts with shampoo? And thats not even the worst of it. No one deserves the torture that this movie delivers. This crass and crude sloppily put together film doesn't have anything in comedy aside from a few slapstick jokes that my 7 year old cousin found to be immature. If you want to watch a good comedy, i suggest instead watching Rush Hour 2 or Caddyshack, and not this piece of work solely created to torture the civilized human being inoccently trying to find a good comedy to watch."
2,"I'd rather eat Zerba poop. Believe me, I have.","Hi, it's me Bernie, reviewer of TOMB RAIDER: LAURA KRAFT.Excuse, but sisters, this movie is just poohie! Only a gay man who got stuck on a blind date to the movies with a woman would watch this. I mean, Ivan Reitman ought to bust his own ghost! Um-K? So there's these fake aliens who try to take over the earth while holding a grandma hostage in a semi truck... Boring! And Mulder was here to investigate- where in the stinky pinky is Scully?????????????!!!!!!!!!!! Come on Reitman. Let's go teach you how to direct a movie. Jullianne Moore, Chris Farley and George Clooney co-star in this odd made moo-V. HA HA HA. [...] Skip this lay-moe moo-V.Thanks so Much, Bernie Mocco"
3,really 3 1/2,"This movie was not great, but it was good.The cast includes David Duchovny, Julianne Moore, Sean William Scott, Orlando Jones, and Dan Akyroyd.The movie is about a comet that lands on earth and has alien parasites on it that evelove much faster than we did as humans.The movie has some scenes that are great, and some scenes that are stretched out.The highlight of the movie was defiantly Sean William Scott.He was very funny.The ending was good and included an infomercial for head and shoulders. Though the ending was good, the movie was not great. If you have time on your hands i suggest you see this, but otherwise unless you really have a desire, dont see it."
4,Have a nice end of the world,Evolution is a great movie. It is hilarious and smart. If you don't laugh your nots. It involves alien microbes that evole a billion times faster than earth creatures do. Eventually they get big enough to take over the world. It has a great cast of caractors and creatures. Great special effects. The only reason it gets 4 stars is the deleted scenes. The scene where they were chasing the creature (don't know why they call it a bird). That was a great scene and showed have been in the movie. Also the alternate ending was way better than the stupid head and shoulders commercial they chose. Still evolution is a great film. People who don't like it need to evolve.
3,Entertaining but nothing special,"Evolution is no perfect movie, everything is just messly thrown together and the formula just has Ghostbusters written all over it. Might of worked better if it wasn't from the same director. However I enjoyed David Duchovny in comic mode and Orlando Jones is even funnier as his sidekick through most the movie. Later they're joined by Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore who aren't as effective. Scott plays his usual weird goofball role while Moore's clumbsieness is more annoying than funny. A lot of the time the film is more gross than funny but it still has it's share of laughs even if not all of them work. The Science Fiction actually works better, well if you leave out that the only way to kill the creatures is with Dandrough Shampoo."
3,Halirious!,"This movie was halirious! In fact it was the only movie I went to see twice in theaters!The actors/actresses were fantastic, Duchovny and Jones, being my favourites. A very funny, well-written sci-fi comedy. It reminded me of Ghostbusters, but a slightly different style. All the actors were amazing in this film.(David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William-Scott, Julianne Moore).Also, there was great special effects throughout the movie.I reccommend this movie, very much!! A must see!!"
2,Too Predictable,"The plot is very easy to predict. No ""cute"" aliens with character. A lot of ""duplication"" from GHOSTBUSTERS."
3,GIVE IT A BONUS,This movie is yet another knock off of sci-fi spoof movies.AS shown in some of the above reveiws it has its good &bad points.Mostly bad points-and I would rather give it a 2.5 star rating.Beging that is not a choice -I'll stay with 3stars for it's funny moments and some of the neat cgi -fx.See this movie if you like spoofs or have nothing better too do.Not worth night admittion.The worst part is it becomes a big head &shoulders ad. In a nut shell.Bio professors find a metor .They try too keep it a secret from milatary.Military finds out.They screw up.Bio prof's save the day.This movie is proof that with the right shampoo -anyone can be a hero.
4,Enjoyable Hokum,Not being a great fan of Duchovney I wanted to really dislike this film and avoided it until it's HBO showing. However I found it quite enjoyable. The CGI affects are particularly good and though it's not laugh out loud funny it was amusing and I certainly didn't notice the hour and three quarters pass.
3,Okay,"Despite the director's previous experience bringing alien slime and ectoplasm to the silver screen in his earlier hit, Ghostbusters, this movie, although it doesn't fall flat, isn't in the same league as Ghostbusters.Still, it has its moments, and there are some very funny scenes. But although the movie gets off to a quick start, it sort of drags in the middle, but then it picks up toward the end again and the climax with the aliens' final destruction comes off pretty well. Okay for a video rental for a slow night."
5,this show is great,I bought this show cause it was cheap and to my suprise it is really good and funny. You will enjoy this flick cause its a good story and its funny as heck.
5,GREAT SHOW,GREAT SHOW LOVE IT VERY FUNNY IT WAS VERY GOOD MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING THANKS MERRY CHRISTMAS
5,"Good quality comedy, great cast",Really enjoyed seeing this movie when it came out. Still enjoy watching this movie won't get tired of watching this movie
1,"Ghostbusters rip-off without script, wit or charm","Obviously, the makers of this movie tried to replicate the movie Ghostbusters, which was a funny, witty movie, supported by a great cast with remarkable chemistry. This movie has none of the above.Speaking about evolution, this movie seems to prove that comedies are evolving to become cruder, dumber, unfunny, employ low-browed humor and appeal to the lowest common denominator. This is a backward evolution. But as you will see from some of the reviews here, even this charlatan production can find some fans these days (or else it's the movies producers who are sneaking in favorable reviews to Amazon's website...)David Duchovny and Julianne Moore (a fine actress) will want to erase this movie from their resume. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the pathetic jokes, the miserable punch lines and the whole movie which seemed to have been produced by senseless people who have no idea about comedy, but are certainly experts in vulgarity."
1,"Heard it was bad, but I didn't know how bad ...","Terribly paced and edited; terrible script; VERY lame jokes throughout; great CGI creatures. Wasn't Orlando Jones on SNL or something? Couldn't he have helped add some humor - or at least refuse to spout the incredibly lame lines given him?The cinematography could use some work too, especially in framing some of the scenes.David D. sometimes a little too wooden; the movie then tries and fails to interject some bravado - it just looks fake.Intellectual? Are you kidding me? Fun? Only if you enjoy squirming to amazingly lame dialogue and plot. If you do, more power to ya."
1,It was like a car accident,"Late one nite on cable, this came on. Julianne Moore was in so I decided to watch from the beginning. It was so bad that I just want someone to admit publicly that they've done movies for either the money or to fulfill part of some other deal. I refuse to believe that mature adults read things like the this, get involved, know the words on paper will be translated to film forever and still get involved.Though I've taken jobs for money, I in no way judge others for doing the same. I just want them to admit it.Don't buy this movie and don't tape it from cable, one viewing will give you the gist of this REALLY bad X-Files/Ghostbusters dreck."
2,"Thankfully, comedy has evolved; or has it?","When I saw this in the theater I was rather bored to tears. I remember that I saw it with my sister and her boyfriend and we were the only three in the theater and they got so bored that they started running through the theater pretending to be aliens and attacking the chairs and screaming like dinosaurs and I remember that that was the most entertaining part of the whole experience. I have since seen the film again (on cable) and it certainly has its moments, but this film does seem rather cheap in comparison to many other comedies out there. The jokes seem almost too obvious and in the end too `gross' for their own good. I love Julianne Moore and find Orlando Jones to be a gifted comedian, but this material fails them in many ways. The special effects are nice (for the time) but there really isn't enough substance here to validate repeated viewings."
3,Much more could have ben done with this given the subject.,Dave Duchony has a dry & droll wit. Julianne Moore is cute in any thing she does. The monsters rapidly evolving were good in their supporting roles. The rest of the cast wasn't as funny as it was stupid. I enjoyed the movie. It could have been better if it didn't lower itself to that vast consumer market: 12 year old boys who still think that fart jokes are funny.
4,"Good, but not great","I laughed watching this movie. You can't quite shake the FBI image of Duchovny as easily as you can in Playing God, but he is good at playing a college professor at a community college in the sticks. Orlando Jones, the geology instructor at the same college and area representative of the US Geological Survey, is far more suited to comedy that Duchovny, which is why I think it works well. Not perfectly, but well.A big hunk of rock crashes in the desert, and they get to go out and poke around it and see what it is. Its' more than a rock.The humor is not cerebral, but if you want high-brow, watch PBS. I do myself, but I was in the mood for other comedy, and I watched this. Twice in 3 days. I enjoyed it. I am not sure I would recommend it, but if someone asked me if it was a good movie, I would say it was pretty good. Definately above average."
2,"Bad, bad, bad.","Bad script and mostly bad acting are only marginally redeemed by a droll Duchovny and decent special effects. Might be amusing to pre-teens and fans of butt jokes. Reitman should have been able to do much, much better."
4,Good light fun.,Enjoyable lightweight entertainment that is occassionally laugh out loud funny. Evolution is a comedy in the vein of Tremors or Ghost Busters.
1,Do not Evoulutionize,"I really dislike this movie. The cast was good and there were like 2 good laughs but it was just worthless. The story line was very bad and the dialouge was even worse. I was about a metoer than crashed into the Earth. when they found it, it was leaking this blue stuff. When David Duchovny looked at it through a microscope he sees that it is growing exremely fast. I dont feel like telling anymore because this movie sickened me. Save your money. DONT see this movie."
2,Alienbusters!,"Director Ivan Reitman delivers another special-effects laden ""humorfest,"" this time involving creatures from another world.Perhaps they thought this film was funny. It was about as good as I had expected it to be, which wasn't much. When the ""best"" scenes in the trailer aren't funny, worry. Seann William Scott's character is actually funnier than the trailer gives him credit for; he's come a long (well, not too long, I actually liked him better in Final Destination) way since American Pie.The funniest character is played by Orlando Jones, who, unfortunately is made the victim of a drawn-out (and recurring) anal probe joke. David Duchovny really looks like he doesn't want to be here, and delivers his humorous lines as if he is doubting anyone will find them funny. Julianne Moore is the token female, ostensibly around so the male characters can fantasize about her.This film had all the proper ingredients for a blockbuster science-fiction comedy except two: a funny script and a heart."
4,A SciFi movie that is not what it seems,"To put it simply, there are worse SciFi flicks out there, and call me crazy but I can't help but enjoy myself immensely whenver I watch this movie. David Duchoveny, Julienna Moore, Orlando Jones and the often ommitted but wonderful Ted Levine are wonderful and keep the pace of the movie moving. Even Dan Ackroyd has a brief stint as the governer. Evolution is a movie that while lacks in earthly and alien intelligence, it does not however lack in either laughs or keeping you interested.If you are however looking for something a bit more intellectual like say ""The Hitchikers guide to the galaxy,"" or maybe ET, this is not the way to go. (Obviously,) but if not, definatly try this movie."
4,pleasent surprise,"never herd of this movie when it was in the theater (mabe it never was i'm not sure). i know it's Not exactly oscar worthy but it's far from a flop too. it has a very good storyline, excellant originality, great choices for cast members, exceptional imagination (creature animation), blended with decent comedy.a few scenes were somewhat crude for young kids (but that's why it's pg13). overall i realy liked it"
4,Sooo Funny,I watched this movie in the theatre. The entire audience laughed out loud through the whole film. It was the first and only time I've experienced thunderous applause in a movie theatre. And I quite agreed.If you want to put on a feel good night for your friends- have them over for dinner and this film.
3,BUGBUSTERS,"Perhaps David Duchovny is doomed to follow in the steps of many tv stars who just can't make it ""big"" on the big screen. The X-FILES star did well enough in the feature-length film of that series, but other than that, he's floundered. EVOLUTION does have some wonderfully wacky moments, and some brilliant special effects. What it lacks is a consistency in tone and a good team of actors. Julianne Moore is hilarious as the clumsy CDC rep; Orlando Jones is as effective as Ernie Hudson has been; and Seann William Scott does his usual goofus stint. Ted Levine is very good as the greedy general, and Dan Akroyd is wasted in his role as the governor.There are funny sequences, but there seems to be a lot of time when you're waiting for something to make you laugh again.Inventive, but not the movie it should have been."
3,Ghostbusters meets the X Files?,"I saw the trailer for this movie and when I spotted Dan Aykroyd and David Duchovny I knew I wanted to see this movie. I'm looking forward to a lightweight, silly movie that pokes fun at aliens and the humans who encounter them. Perfect for a Friday night movie at the shore or whenever you want to relax and be entertained."
1,Head and Shoulders????,"Quick review: small university scientists fight alien life form that wants to take over the world and ""mulder"" and co. defeat these ""aliens"" with a firetruck full of head and shoulders????? Believe me, you can waste two hours of your life on something else."
2,"Wow, Evolution Sucks","This movie is so not funny it's frightening. I think I may have giggled a total of about two times throughout the entire hour and forty minutes of show time. Has Hollywood truly still not matured to the point where a comedy can come out that doesn't rely on bathroom humor and racial jokes? Jeeze Duchovny, how could you stoop to this level..."
1,Thank God I Wanted for the DVD!,"Evolution is probably one of the most painfully bad movies, I have seen in years. A ""comedy"" with absolutely no wit or humor. I suppose somebody had a story concept, pitched it to the right people and cast it with better than adequate actors....BUT FORGOT TO WRITE THE SCRIPT! Imagine a really long, labored, and unfunny Saturday Night Live sketch and you get the idea. I love Julianne Moore, but what was she thinking?!"
3,See a matinee or rent it.,"I like Ghostbusters and the ridiculous humor of Orlando Jones and Seann William Scott. I gave the movie three stars because at least by the end, I wasn't staring at my watch the whole time. The film makes a bad first impression by not producing a laugh (or trying?) for about 20 minutes. The main problem is the film tries to use its actors like Ghostbusters uses its actors: with subtlety. Duchovny fits this mold. But Jones and Scott must be flaunted. Scott is perhaps the leading facial contortionist in movies today. That is why I proclaim the shopping mall scene the highlight of this film. I guess I liked it, but I want some of my ... dollars back."
5,HILARIOUS! A MUST SEE!,"Evolution is the funniest movie of the year! Putting a complete nutcase (Orlando Jones[7 UP guy]) With a very serious actor (Duchovony) was Brilliant! This is a very funny movie that everyone should see TWICE! There are a few sexual jokes though. Otherwise, the movie was hilarious! *****"
2,It isn't as good as it looks,"There were some funny parts in Evolution, however, it wasn't as good as Ghostbusters, MiB, or any other comedy movies. There was some dry humor, and, I have to admit, the jokes stunk The visuals were awesome, and the acting was OK."
